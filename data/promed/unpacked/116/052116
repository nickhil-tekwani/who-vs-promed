A virulent fungus outbreak alarms the winegrowers of Ribeira Sacra
------------------------------------------------------------------
Rainfall over the past few days and the high temperatures recorded in
the Ribeira Sacra [wine region of eastern Galicia] have set alarm
bells ringing among the growers by the sudden emergence of a virulent
fungus that attacks the vines, mildew. Its incidence in the vineyards
is in parts very high, affecting maturing bunches as well as leaves,
and barely noticeable in others.

Several growers said that this is a "serious risk on which we must
act immediately." The effect on the 2010 harvest "will be minimal as
long as growers try to act promptly." This was an "atypical" year in
which the constant weather changes led also to the appearance of
black rot. There are farms that can lose 30 percent of production.
Growers have been "surprised" by the rapid emergence of this disease.
"It was overnight, I never saw anything like it," one grower said.

[There are 2 mildews of grapevine. Downy mildew (DM) is caused by the
fungus _Plasmopara viticola_. Symptoms include lesions on leaves,
which later become necrotic. During years with warm, extended wet
periods during bloom, fruit clusters may be partially or totally
destroyed. Powdery mildew (PM) is caused by the fungus _Erysiphe_
(previously _Uncinula_) _necator_. Leaves heavily infected by PM have
reduced photosynthetic ability resulting in decreased plant vigour
and increased chance of winter injury to the vines. PM is favoured by
warm temperatures and the absence of rain. Since high rainfall is
reported above to be the trigger for the mildew outbreak, it appears
more likely that DM is the cause.

Mildew spores are spread to the leaves and berries mainly by
splashing rain, wind, or mechanical means. The fungi overwinter in
infected leaves on the ground. Mildew diseases on grapevine can be
extremely serious and will cause severe crop loss. They can be
controlled with fungicides, however, wet weather may interfere with
fungicide applications and fungal strains with fungicide resistances
are emerging.

Black rot of grapevine is caused by the fungus _Guignardia
bidwellii_. If uncontrolled, it can be devastating in terms of crop
loss. Symptoms include leaf lesions developing a black border and
shrivelling of berries on bunches ('mummies'). Leaf, cane, and
tendril infection can occur only when the tissue is young, but
berries can be infected until almost fully grown and eventually fall
to the ground where they serve as inoculum source for the rest of the
season. Spores are spread by splashing rain, wind, and mechanical
means, and wet weather favours the disease. Control with fungicides
is effective if well timed and if good spray coverage can be
achieved. Moderate levels of resistance have been identified in some
grapevine hybrids.
