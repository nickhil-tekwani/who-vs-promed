D-2002-0219-05N, 2002. Accepted for publication 25 Jan 2002.
Diseased plants of oat (_Avena sativa_ L.) exhibiting abnormal
proliferation of spikelets were observed in the field in Raseniai,
Lithuania. The possible association of a phytoplasma with the disease,
termed oat proliferation (OatP), was determined using polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) for amplification of phytoplasmal ribosomal (r) RNA gene
(rDNA) sequences from template DNA extracted from the diseased oats.
DNA extractions and nested PCRs were conducted as previously described (2).
In the nested PCRs, the first reaction was primed by phytoplasma-universal
primer pair P1/P7, and the second (nested) PCR was primed by primer pair
R16F2n/R16R2 (F2n/R2). Phytoplasmal rDNA was amplified in the nested PCR,
indicating that the plants contained a phytoplasma, designated oat
proliferation (OatP) phytoplasma.
OatP... was identified and classified according to the system of Lee et al.
(2) through ... RFLP analysis of 16S rDNA amplified in the PCR primed by
F2n/R2. On the basis of collective RFLP patterns of the 16S rDNA, ... OatP
was classified as a member of group 16SrI (group I, aster yellows
phytoplasma group).
The RFLP patterns of the 16S rDNA were indistinguishable from those of 16S
rDNA from tomato big bud (BB) phytoplasma and other phytoplasmas classified
in group I, subgroup A (subgroup I-A, tomato big bud phytoplasma subgroup).
The 1.8-kbp rDNA product of PCR primed by primer pair P1/P7 was cloned, and
its nucleotide sequence was determined. The sequence was deposited in
GenBank under Accession No. AF453416.
Results from putative restriction site analysis of the cloned and sequenced
rDNA were in excellent agreement with the results from enzymatic RFLP
analysis of uncloned rDNA from OatP-diseased oat plants. Sequence
similarity between the 1.8-kbp rDNA of OatP ... and that of BB phytoplasma
(GenBank No. AF222064) was 99.2 percent; 9 of the 14 base changes were in
the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region. The base differences in rDNA may
signal that the OatP and BB phytoplasmas are mutually distinct in their
biologies.
Phytoplasmas classified in subgroup I-A have previously been reported in a
broad range of plant species in North America and Europe, although there
are no previous definitive reports of oat as a host of a subgroup I-A
phytoplasma (3,4). In 1977, Fedotina (1) reported electron microscopy of a
mycoplasma-like organism (phytoplasma) in pseudorosette-diseased oat plants
in Siberia, but the identity of that phytoplasma remains unknown.
Subgroup I-A phytoplasma strains are geographically widespread and have
been found in numerous plant species (3,4). The discovery reported here, of
a subgroup I-A phytoplasma in diseased oats in Lithuania, provokes
questions concerning possible impacts of this phytoplasma on oat
cultivation in central Europe and other regions.

[Phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas (class _Mollicutes_) have a wide host range
and can cause serious crop losses. Do any of our readers know the extent of
phytoplasma infection in monocotyledonous crop plants? A basic reference
is the proceedings of an electronic conference convened in 1999:
