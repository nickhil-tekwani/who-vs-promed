The South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) says a fox found in Ridgeway tested positive for rabies. Officials say no people reported being exposed, but one dog was exposed to the fox. DHEC says the dog will be quarantined. [Since the dog has a known exposure and is quarantined, it was likely vaccinated against rabies. - Mod.TG]

According to DHEC, the fox was found near Molly Creek Circle and Century Drive. Officials say it was submitted for testing 30 Aug [2021] and confirmed to have rabies the following day.

"Rabies is usually transmitted through a bite or scratch, which allows saliva from an infected animal to be introduced into the body of a person or another animal. However, infected saliva or neural tissue contact with open wounds or areas such as the eyes, nose, or mouth could also potentially transmit rabies," said Terri McCollister, Rabies Program Team Leader. "To reduce the risk of getting rabies, always give wild and stray animals their space. If you see an animal in need, avoid touching it and contact someone trained in handling animals, such as your local animal control officer, wildlife control operator, or a wildlife rehabilitator. Please report all animal bites, scratches, and exposures to potentially rabid animals to DHEC."

If you believe your pet has been exposed to a rabid animal, DHEC urges you to contact DHEC's Environmental Affairs Columbia office at 803-896-0620 during normal business hours (8:30 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday-Friday). To report a bite or exposure after these hours, call the DHEC after-hours service number at 888-847-0902.

Health officials announced on Friday [3 Sep 2021] that a North Providence couple was exposed to rabies.

The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management said the couple fed a raccoon that later was tested and found to be carrying the rabies virus.

"Situations like this highlight the reason why people should keep a safe distance, and keep their pets and livestock a safe distance, from wild animals," said State Veterinarian and chairman of the RI Rabies Control Board Scott Marshall, DVM.

The department said on Tuesday [31 Aug 2021] an environmental police officer responded to a call from the couple saying the raccoon was an adult that had an injured foot and trouble balancing.

The raccoon was euthanized the day after [Wed 1 Sep 2021] and was submitted to Department of Health Laboratories, which confirmed it positive for rabies on Thursday [2 Sep 2021].

"Any contact with a wild mammal is a potential rabies exposure and may necessitate a person undergoing rabies preventive treatment, or the animal being euthanized to test for rabies, both of which can be avoided by simply keeping a safe distance," Marshall said.

The DEM said feeding wild animals is illegal in Rhode Island.

Frederick County Animal Control says a cat collected from the Brunswick Family Campground last Friday [3 Sep 2021] has tested positive for rabies.

The cat is described as a solid gray short hair with a frayed and sparkly pink collar. It had been scratching and biting people at the campgrounds before Animal Control Officers picked it up.

Anyone who has had contact with this cat between 24 Aug and 3 Sep [2021] is asked to consult with their doctor, and notify the Health Department's Community Health Services Office. Many of those who were exposed to the cat were trying to get its legs out of its collar.

Residents whose pets may have had contact with this cat are encouraged to consult with their veterinarian and report it to the Health Department's Environmental Health Office.

The Health Department says rabies is a viral disease that infects mammals. It's spread through the saliva of infected animals, mostly from a bite. Signs of rabies in animals are fear of water, excessive salivation, failure to eat or drink, limping, unusually friendly or aggressive behavior, and/or other behaviors such as nocturnal animals coming out during the daytime.

Health officials say rabies is nearly always fatal to humans. [Always fatal without treatment. - Mod.TG]

"Mammals, such as cats [and numerous other animals - Mod.TG], can be infected with the rabies virus, so do not touch or play with unknown animals, and make sure your pets are vaccinated," says Barry Glotfelty, Director of the County Health Department's Environmental Health Services Office.

If your pets have had contact with a stray or wild animal, contact Frederick County Animal Control.

The Delaware Division of Public Health is advising residents who live or spend time in the vicinity of Route 16 in Greenwood between Judy Road (Road 611) and Century Farm Road (Road 630) of a positive case of rabies in a fox having bitten a human being on 3 Sep [2021]. The individual who was bitten has begun treatment for rabies exposure.

Anyone who thinks they may have been bitten or scratched or have come in contact with a fox in this area should immediately contact their healthcare provider or call the DPH Rabies Program. An epidemiologist is available 24/7. Anyone in the area who thinks a fox might have bitten their pet should call their private veterinarian for examination and treatment, and to report the exposure to the Delaware Department of Agriculture.

The Polk County Sheriff's Office confirmed the 5th rabies case in the county after a dog in Bartow was exposed to an infected bat while on a walk with its owner on 5 Sep [2021].

Sheriff's office officials said animal control responded to a home on Old Bartow Eagle Lake Road in Bartow after the dog's owner called. Animal control officers collected the bat carcass and sent it to a laboratory in Tampa for testing.

The results of the test came back on Wednesday [8 Sep 2021] and confirmed the bat was infected with rabies.

Officials said the dog is vaccinated but will remain quarantined in its home for 45 days out of caution.

The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) is advising Rehoboth Beach residents who live or spend time in the vicinity of Kings Creek Circle and Road 273 of a positive case of rabies in a white-tailed deer in the area. The deer was showing signs of rabies and was removed from a residential property on 1 Sep [2021]. It was then tested for rabies, which yielded positive results on 8 Sep [2021].

Although rabies is very infrequently found in white-tailed deer, with Delaware's deer hunting season having begun on 1 Sep [2021], the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) recommends the following for anyone hunting in the area where the rabid deer was found:

- Minimize handling and do not consume any deer that was acting abnormal or appeared to be sick when harvested.
- Always wear latex or rubber gloves when field-dressing deer.
- Minimize the handling of the deer's brain and spinal cord.
- Do not allow pets around your field dressing area to prevent contact with deer blood and other tissues.
- Wash hands, boots, and knives thoroughly after finishing field dressing a deer.
- If you harvest a deer and have it commercially processed, request your venison is processed individually.
- Properly cook and prepare your venison.

[7] Ravalli County, Montana: horse

A state laboratory-confirmed case of a horse diagnosed with rabies has put Ravalli County under quarantine for unvaccinated dogs, cats, and ferrets for 60 days. But don't expect roadblocks at the county line checking for pets. Be prepared for an update early next week.

The Montana Department of Livestock received confirmation Wednesday [8 Sep 2021] from the state laboratory a horse in Ravalli County had tested positive for rabies.

That unusual development -- there hasn't been a horse with rabies in western Montana for at least 40 years -- was followed by another oddity when the federal Center for Disease Control's rabies test came back negative late Friday afternoon [10 Sep 2021].

That news from the CDC came after the state sent out its notification that pets not current on their rabies vaccine booster in Ravalli County must remain in the county until 31 Oct [2021].

Dr. Tahnee Szymanski of the Montana Department of Livestock said the notification of the CDC's negative test was a surprise. Since it came late on Friday [10 Sep 2021], there wasn't an opportunity for the 2 laboratories to have an extensive conversation about the matter.

Department of Livestock officials decided to leave the quarantine order in place until it could be sorted out as a precaution.

"We're all a little bit perplexed," she said.

The purpose of the quarantine was to reduce the risk of further spread of the disease in the county in case other exposed animals had not been identified, but Szymanski said the state understands it's impossible to enforce.

"It's not like someone is going to be parked on the main roads and making sure you don't have an animal in your vehicle," Szymanski said.

The case should serve as a good reminder for animal owners to update rabies vaccinations for their pets and livestock.

[A most unusual collection of reports this time. Perhaps the most unusual report is the Montana horse. This is extremely unusual to have conflicting reports. However, if the wrong part of a brain is sent for testing, it could be possible to get conflicting reports. But it will be interesting to see what the next report brings on this case.

While any mammal can acquire rabies, we don't see too many reports of the disease in deer. This sounds like it was a captive deer. Deer, like horses and cattle, are curious about the strange creature that comes shuffling through their area and may take a sniff of the creature, often a skunk or raccoon, to be rewarded by a nip on the nose, and thus the transmission of rabies occurs.

Overwhelmingly, this is a call to vaccinate your pets: dogs, cats, horses, and other domestic animals. Even if a human being is not exposed, when our pets are exposed, it is hard on the owners. The pet is stressed in quarantine, or worse, and either situation is hard on pet parents. So protect your pet and yourself. Get your pet vaccinated.

Regardless of where you are -- home, camping, or vacation -- be alert. Any mammal can have rabies. Be cautious of feeding or petting animals you don't know or whose behavior is out of the ordinary for the species. Caution cannot be overstated when dealing with the rabies virus. If you are bitten or exposed through saliva in the eye, or a cut or scratch, please seek medical attention right away. - Mod.TG]
