More than 5200 people have died from cholera in Haiti over the last 7
months, said health authorities Sat 21 May 2011.

The 1st cases in the Caribbean nation's worst cholera epidemic in a
century were detected in the Artibonite province north of the capital
Port-au-Prince in October 2010.

At least 300 000 people have since been infected, at an estimated
rate of 560 per day, according to the latest reports. At least 4
people die of curable waterborne disease every day.

Health officials in the Dominican Republic are reporting hundreds of
new cases of cholera as the outbreak spreads through most of the
country.

Deputy Health Minister Jose Rodriguez says there have been 1143 cases
of cholera and 14 deaths since the outbreak began in November [2010].
The number of new cases reported Mon 23 May 2011 is up about 50
percent since the middle of May 2011.

The Dominican physicians union says cases have been confirmed in 28
of the country's 32 provinces. The situation may worsen with the onset
of the hurricane season in June 2011.

Cholera was detected in the Dominican Republic after an outbreak in
neighboring Haiti in October 2010.

[Even before the Caribbean hurricane season, the number of cases in
DR is increasing and the areas involved spreading. The soon-to-develop
tropical storm season will no doubt increase cases on both sides of
the island shared by Haiti and DR. - Mod.LL]
