Outbreak of the mumps continues in Nova Scotia with 120 cases reported
-----------------------------------------------
Public health officials in Nova Scotia are reporting another jump in
an outbreak of the mumps, as they investigate 120 cases across the
province. Dr. Shelly Sarwal, the medical officer of health, says the
outbreak of the virus continues to center on Halifax, with sporadic
cases in several other areas. The majority of cases remain in the
20-25 age group.
The Public Health Agency of Canada says in an average year, there are
30 to 80 cases of the mumps across the entire country. Sarwal says
the latest increase was expected as doctors look more closely for
mumps and people become aware of the symptoms. The most common
symptoms include fever, head and muscle aches, and swollen and tender
glands at the angle of the jaw. Mumps is spread by coughing,
sneezing, sharing drinks and kissing.
Public health officials continue to encourage people to see their
family doctor if they have symptoms.

[In the last ProMED-mail report on this outbreak (Mumps - Canada (NS)
(03) 20070409.1189) the case count was 32 confirmed cases. In the
above newswire, there is mention of 120 cases under investigation;
even if 50 percent of those under investigation were ruled out as not
due to mumps, this would represent an almost doubling in the number
of cases in less than 14 days. Obviously, a question is whether there
is heightened awareness among the community leading to a higher
capture rate with more of the cases being reported. In the prior
posting, there was a discussion on the multifactoral "vaccine
failures" observed -- ranging from failure to get vaccinated (both
1st and 2nd doses) to failure of the vaccine, either primary or
secondary, related to questionable vaccination procedures in vaccine
administration and storage -- which pointed out the complex issues
public health officials are facing in Nova Scotia (and elsewhere) for
control of vaccine preventable diseases. - Mod.MPP]
