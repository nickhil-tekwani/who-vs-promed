Over the past week the retail price of rice has held steady. But in
Dhaka long queues continued outside government open market sales
centres. Although this month's [April 2008] 'boro' rice harvest,
which accounts for some 60 percent of the country's yield, is
expected to be a bumper one, severe crop losses as a result of
monsoon floods last year [2007], coupled with a devastating cyclone,
have helped keep stocks low.

Bacterial leaf blight (BLB), a serious rice disease, also poses a
threat to stocks, but agriculture adviser CS Karim was optimistic
this week, saying 'boro' production would exceed the target this year
[2008] thanks in part to proper remedial measures having been taken.
His optimism was echoed by researchers and agricultural experts at
Bangladesh Agricultural University who said the BLB outbreak in many
areas would probably not cause extensive damage to the 'boro' yield.

However, Bangladesh's is far from being out of the woods, with
government officials predicting the "crisis" likely to last quite
some time. "Bangladesh could have a food surplus if different rice
strains were grown properly. Good seeds, good plants, balanced growth
of crops, and efficient irrigation at the right time can produce 6 to
7 metric tonnes of food grains per hectare," MA Hamid, a scientist at
the International Rice Research Institute [IRRI], said.

[Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas
oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_ (previously _X. campestris_ pv. _oryza_). It was
first noticed in Japan in 1884 and has since been reported from Asia,
northern Australia, Africa, and the USA. The pathogen causes
yellowing and drying of leaves, wilting of seedlings, and reduces
yield. In Asia, millions of hectares of rice paddies are severely
affected every year with reported yield losses of up to 60 percent.

Blight lesions caused by severe strains of the bacterium elongate
over the entire length of the flag leaf, giving a striped appearance
to leaves. Lesions caused by mild strains are usually only a few
centimeters long. Mild strains may not cause any detectable yield
loss. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing
to the damage. Panicles may also be infected by severe strains. Field
patches infested with bacterial blight have a whitish, ragged
appearance.

The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seedborne,
but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant
material, such as rice stubble or ratoons, and contaminated
irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs.
The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for
example when transplanting seedlings) and is favoured by rain, high
levels of fertiliser, high humidity, standing pools of water, and
temperatures above 25 deg C (77 deg F).

Boro rice is an irrigated, high-yielding, cold-tolerant, relatively
pest-free, and photoperiod-insensitive rice cultivated during the
winter months in India and Bangladesh. Other types of rice grown in
the region are 'amon' and 'aus'. In addition to BLB, these have been
reported to be currently affected in Bangladesh by other diseases as
well (see ProMED-mail post no. 20071030.3524). Recent outbreaks of
BLB have also been reported from India and Pakistan (see previous
ProMED-mail posts listed below).
