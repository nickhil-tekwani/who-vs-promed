[1] A new strain of _Streptomyces_ causing common scab in potato

Common scab is a serious disease of potatoes (_Solanum tuberosum_)
and other root and tuber crops, affecting the quality and market
value of these crops. The disease is caused by gram-positive soil
bacteria in the genus _Streptomyces_. A new common scab-causing
streptomycete was isolated from scabby potatoes originating in
southeastern Idaho.
Research has supported a model of horizontal transfer of
pathogenicity determinants among streptomycetes, and the new strain
has hallmarks of the recently characterized _Streptomyces_
pathogenicity island (PAI); it has genes encoding the synthetase for
the pathogenicity determinant thaxtomin and for a 2nd pathogenicity
factor, tomatinase, although it lacks a third gene characteristic of
the _Streptomyces_ PAI, the nec1 gene. The new strain has a unique
16s rDNA gene sequence closely related to those of other pathogenic
_Streptomyces_ species. This 16s rDNA sequence was also found in
isolates lacking a PAI, suggesting that the new pathogenic strain
arose by horizontal transfer of a PAI into a saprophytic
streptomycete.
Isolates of the new strain are pathogenic on radish and potato, and
are more virulent than the _S. scabies_ type strain. In addition to
scab lesions on potato tubers, lesions were also seen on underground
stems and stolons. This new strain represents additional complexity
in the pathogenic strains causing plant disease in the United States.

[2] Additional information on potato common scab
Date: Tue 24 Apr 2007
From Dick Hamilton <rihamilto@shaw.ca>

Common scab is prevalent in most potato growing areas worldwide. This
disease, characterized by deep- or shallow-pitted lesions on potato
tubers, reduces the quality of severely infected crops. Although
cultivars differ in their level of resistance, very few are highly
resistant and none is immune (Scholte & Labruyere, 1985). Potato
cultivars known to be particularly susceptible to common scab include
'Desiree', 'Foremost', 'Majestic', 'Maris Piper', and 'Red Craigs
Royal'; more resistant cultivars include 'Arran Comet', 'Arran
Pilot', 'Golden Wonder', 'King Edward', 'Maris Peer', 'Pentland
Crown', and 'Pentland Javelin'.
The pathogen is also found on a number of root crops, including
carrot, radish, beet, and turnip. If grown in rotation with potato,
these susceptible crops may increase soil populations of pathogenic
_Streptomyces_ and therefore scab incidence. The disease is more
prevalent on alkaline soils which have a light sandy texture and
which are deficient in organic matter. Some less common strains cause
scab in soils with pH below 5.0. Infection is usually only
superficial and the potatoes are fit to eat. Infection occurs when
the tubers are just beginning to form, and if this stage of growth
coincides with dry soil conditions then levels of the disease can be
high.
For disease management, use certified seed potatoes. Planting
infested tubers not only results in disease at harvest, but also can
introduce new more aggressive strains of the pathogen. Increase the
length of time between successive potato crops. Avoid soil treatments
that raise pH such as application of lime. Apply plenty of organic
matter to light soils to increase their moisture-holding capacity,
and ensure that the soil is kept moist during the crucial stage of
early tuber formation.

[_Streptomyces scabies_, the organism causing common potato scab, is
a soil-borne bacterium. Therefore fungicides are not effective for
disease control. Research is being carried out into biological
control of _S. scabies_ by antibiotic-producing strains of
_Streptomyces_ isolated from suppressive soils (see link below).
There is a large variety of _Streptomyces_ strains not all of which
cause disease (Doering-Saad et al. 1992).
Another potato disease called powdery potato scab is caused by the
fungus-like organism _Spongospora subterranea_. Although symptoms on
potato tubers look somewhat similar, the 2 pathogens are not related
at all. _S. subterranea_ is also the vector for _Potato mop-top
pomovirus_.
As in this case of the 2 potato scabs, it is not unusual that similar
symptoms are caused by entirely different pathogens. Therefore, most
often symptoms alone cannot be considered a reliable diagnostic tool
in plant pathology or biosecurity applications and suitable molecular
diagnostic tests need to be used.
