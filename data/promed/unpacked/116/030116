Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) -- also known as monkey fever -- has claimed its 2nd victim in the state [Karnataka], a 64 year old resident of Siddapura, Uttara Kannada [district in Karnataka state] who died due to the dreaded disease [KFD] on [Sat 29 Mar 2020].

The Siddapura death comes almost a month after a 58 year old woman in Sagar, Shivamogga [district in the Karnataka state], died due to the disease. BH, a resident of Malaguli in Honneghataki of Siddapura taluk, died while being moved to a hospital in Manipal from Shivamogga.

Dr Ashok Kumar, DHO [district health officer?], said: "Two cases of KFD have been confirmed in Siddapura. Viscera samples from the carcass of the monkey also revealed the presence of the virus. We have enough stock of vaccines and are creating awareness among the public about vaccination. KFD surfaces in the Malnad areas from March to May but has popped up as early as January this year [2020]."

In Shivamogga alone, 55 people have tested positive for the KFD virus, sources revealed to DH. "Out of 55 positive cases, 22 people were vaccinated with 2 and 3 rounds of vaccination. As the mercury levels are beginning to soar, KFD is also gaining momentum," a medical officer said.

[KFD is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_, characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The virus was 1st identified in 1957 after it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka State, India. The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html.

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to preventing KFD.

There is no specific treatment for KFD. Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf.

The recommended preventive measures include using tick repellents, walking along clear trails, avoiding contact with weeds, and wearing full-sleeved clothes and long pants to cover exposed skin to reduce contact with ticks and subsequent tick bites. - Mod.UBA
