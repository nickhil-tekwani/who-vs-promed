JAMA ISSUE ON EMERGING INFECTIONS
=================================
Many of you know that JAMA dedicated its Jan 17 issue to Emerging
Infections, and 36 other journals participated. It was quite a media
event.
I forward a notice from JAMA [the Journal of the American Medical
Association]:
...
the AMA Home Page is http://www.ama-assn.org, and you can access
the JAMA Home Page through the AMA page.
[See] either the Table of Contents or through a hot button in the "What's
New" section for both the AMA and the JAMA home page. The list of the
36 participating journals and the article citations are also provided
on the Home Page.
