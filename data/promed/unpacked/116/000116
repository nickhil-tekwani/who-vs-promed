A Japanese supermarket chain pulled frozen beans produced in China
from its shelves on Wednesday [15 Oct 2008] after they were found to
be tainted with pesticide, the latest in a string of food safety
scandals to hit Chinese producers.

China moved quickly to launch an investigation and a food safety
official told Japanese diplomats in Beijing that the government was
concerned about the possible effect on ties with Tokyo.

At least one woman was briefly hospitalised with vomiting and a numb
mouth after eating the green beans imported by Nichirei Foods and
sold in Ito-Yokado supermarkets, media reports said.

The Chinese manufacturer of the products, Yantai Beihai Foodstuff
Co., told Kyodo news agency it had halted shipments of all its
products following the incident.

Tests showed one package of beans contained 34 000 times the
permitted level of dichlorvos, a highly toxic insecticide, Japan's
Health Ministry said.

The food scare emerged a month after a scandal over Chinese milk
tainted with the industrial chemical melamine, which killed 4 babies
in China, made tens of thousands ill and forced product recalls
around the world, including in Japan.

A senior Chinese food safety official told diplomats at Japan's
embassy in Beijing that China was investigating the incident and had
already determined that dichlorvos was not used in the cultivation of
the beans or in the processing plant.

The official added that the batch of beans had passed all safety
tests at Chinese customs, the Japanese foreign ministry said in a statement.

Earlier this year [2008], several Japanese were made ill by
Chinese-made dumplings that also contained insecticide, but a joint
investigation has so far failed to reveal how the contamination occurred.

"For more than a year, products made in China have caused damage in
various places," Prime Minister Taro Aso told reporters, referring to
a previous scandal over Chinese pet food in the United States. He
added that mistrust over food would not be good for either country.

Ito-Yokado apologised for the incident and urged customers not to eat
the tainted beans, but to return them to stores.

In a separate incident, toluene, a solvent, was found in
Chinese-produced sweet beans that made a woman living north of Tokyo
slightly ill, Kyodo news agency said on Wednesday [15 OCT 2008].

[Dichlorvos is an organophosphate insecticide, which is used to
control insects primarily in storage areas and barns. It can affect
the nervous system where it may cause nausea and vomiting,
restlessness, sweating, and muscle tremors at high levels. It is a
dense colorless liquid. It has a sweetish smell and readily mixes
with water. Dichlorvos used in pest control is diluted with other
chemicals and used as a spray. It can also be incorporated into
plastic that slowly releases the chemical.

Ingesting large doses may cause nausea and vomiting, restlessness,
sweating, and muscle tremors, while very large doses may cause coma,
inability to breathe, and death. Animal studies have also shown
effects on the nervous system when animals drank water or ate food
containing dichlorvos.

Any organophosphate is an anticholinesterase agent, thereby blocking
acetylcholine and resulting in clinical signs associated with
excessive salivation, lacrimation, urination, diarrhea, and
gastrointestinal effects.

Compared to poisoning by other organophosphates, dichlorvos causes a
more rapid onset of symptoms, which is often followed by a similarly
rapid recovery. The reason for this rapid disappearance of dichlorvos
is the presence of degrading enzymes in both tissues and blood
plasma. When dichlorvos is absorbed after ingestion, it is moved
rapidly to the liver where it is rapidly detoxified.

It is not known whether dichlorvos can affect reproduction or cause
birth defects in people. Animal studies have not reported effects on
reproduction or birth defects when animals were exposed to dichlorvos.

It is not known whether dichlorvos causes cancer in people. A study
in rats and mice reported that rats had an increase in cancer of the
pancreas and in leukemia, and female mice had an increase in stomach
cancer after they were fed dichlorvos for 2 years.

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has determined
that dichlorvos is possibly carcinogenic to humans.

Food scare: Chinese green beans pulled from shelves
---------------------------------------------------
Japanese officials said 15 Oct 2008 that a highly toxic pesticide has
been detected in frozen green beans imported from China. [The beans]
are being blamed for sending at least one person to the hospital.

As a result, a Japanese supermarket chain pulled the frozen beans
from its shelves on Wednesday (15 Oct 2008), Reuters reported. The
move comes after it was discovered the beans were tainted with a pesticide.

Preliminary tests showed one package of beans contained 34 000 times
the permitted level of the highly toxic insecticide, Japan's Health
Ministry said.


The victim, a woman, was hospitalized with vomiting and a numb mouth
after eating the green beans, which are imported from China by
Nichirei Foods and sold in Ito-Yokado supermarkets, according to the report.

This latest food scare comes just a month after a major scandal
involving tainted milk, which killed 4 babies in China and made
thousands of others sick. During that investigation, officials found
the milk contained melamine -- an industrial chemical.
