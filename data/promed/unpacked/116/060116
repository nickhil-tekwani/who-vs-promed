The question on what is the possibility of contaminated products remaining
on the shelf itself leads to many other questions: what is the expected
response in other parts of the world? Is the WHO (World Health
Organization) or any other international body playing a role that will
prevent delayed response in other parts of the world? How will the banned
poultry products be destroyed? And where? This needs to be strictly
monitored before some unscrupulous group connive to illegally ship them to
the so- called third world where information is slow and awareness of
current events minimal.
This has been in the case in the past where toxic wastes of various
industrial processes in the west where shipped to Africa and Asia to
unsuspecting communities. The recent attempt by the South Africa Company,
EnvironServ, to dump about 100,000 tons of toxic waste from New York City
to the port of Walvis Bay, Namibia: The efforts of environment protection
organisations and other concerned groups prevailed See The Basel Action
Network (BAN) news at http://www.ban.org/
Also of greater interest from BAN is the more recent report-June 7,1999 -
success of environmental and community activists in halting a controversial
Danish-funded project to burn obsolete pesticides at a cement factory in
Matola, 15 kms from the Mozambican capital of Maputo. Critics argue that
toxic waste incineration is contested in developed countries because, even
under optimum safety conditions, cancer-causing compounds (dioxin and
furans) are released into the air and into the food chain, while factory
workers risk contamination. Danida, the project backer, says it will help
get rid of 500 tons of expired pesticides collected from all over the
country, 42 tons of which contain products banned worldwide, ranked as
class 1, the most dangerous.
Further perusal of available data and literature on the internet may even
reveal more damaging patterns. Hence, the current hue and cry about dioxin,
among other potentially dangerous chemicals in Europe and elsewhere ought
to be used to further highlight the plight of the peoples of the developing
world [who are constantly subjected to the dumping of banned products from
the West. These may finally find their way into the populace directly or
indirectly by contaminating the food chain at various levels. The potential
new diseases that result may often take a long time to fully diagnose as
the etiologies are not yet known and the disease patterns not described.
