Baxter resident Jill Swift never thought something as seemingly harmless as wilted maple leaves would pose a threat to her beloved thoroughbred Sophie.

Over the years, Swift had only heard of several types of plants and weeds that are toxic to horses. So when her veterinarian said the leaves were what caused her horse's death, she was quite surprised.

"Most horse owners are aware of many weeds that can be harmful to your horse, but not a lot of people are aware of these fallen, dead leaves," she said. Sophie was found lying in the field at a local ranch close to where some leaves had blown over from a neighboring property from a red maple tree that had just been chopped down.

She said the 8-year-old mare was suffering from muscle spasms and kidney failure, and the leaves caused her urine to turn red.

The horse was moved into the stable on a Monday and died 4 days later. Swift was absolutely devastated. "I stayed with her the entire week to make sure she was comfortable," she said. "I took the whole week off from work."

It turns out even the ranch owner wasn't aware the leaves are toxic to horses. "She also had some trees not far from the paddocks as well, and she has had horses in the paddock for 10 years," she said.

According to Dr. John Baird, professor emeritus at the Ontario Veterinary College in Guelph, who specializes in equine dermatology, gastroenterology, renal and hepatic diseases, red maple leaves (_Acer rubrum_), especially wilted ones, are extremely poisonous to horses, along with alpacas. The leaves cause serious damage to horse's red blood cells once absorbed into its digestive system.

"The damage to the red cells results in the horse becoming depressed, weak, lethargic, and their respiratory rate is increased," he wrote in an email. He said signs of red maple toxicosis usually start to show within 1-2 days of the leaves being consumed and that anywhere between 1.5 to 3 pounds worth of leaves can cause the disease.

Baird said 60 per cent of horses that come down with the disease die. He said more horses tend to get the disease during the summer and fall when the leaves are on the trees and have fallen to the ground.

While removing the trees or not planting them where horses graze is the best way to protect animals, Baird said ranchers can take further steps.

"Owners should be aware that following storms, branches of maple trees may be blown or fall into horse paddocks," he wrote.

Swift, who treated her horse like family, hopes other horse owners will learn from her loss so they don't have to go through the same heartbreak. "She was really looking good, and we were going to a show this summer," she said. "It just shouldn't have happened."

Another common tree in Ontario toxic to horses is Box elder (_Acer negundo_). The tree seeds contain a toxin which results in a severe muscular disease in horses called seasonal atypical myopathy, which is frequently fatal.

Yew trees are also very toxic to horses and other animal species. They contain toxic alkaloids which affect the heart and result in a sudden fatal heart disease.

[In North America, the toxic ingredient in red maple (_Acer rubrum_) leaves is believed to be gallic acid (1). Gallic acid causes methemoglobinemia [a blood disorder in which an abnormal amount of methemoglobin -- a form of hemoglobin -- is produced] and is plentiful in both water and methanol extracts of red maple, sugar maple and silver maple, and in the extract fractions from these species that oxidize blood cells (1). Ingestion of wilted or partially dried red maple leaves from fallen or pruned branches causes lysis of the red blood cells with the subsequent development of a hemolytic anemia, which can be deadly (2).

Horses often die within 18-24 hours of ingestion of wilted leaves. Horses that remain alive for 18-24 hours after ingestion of wilted leaves will be severely depressed and cyanotic and produce dark red or brown urine. The mucous membranes are blue to brown from poor oxygenation. They suffer intravascular and extravascular hemolysis (red blood cell breakdown). The percentage of red blood cells circulating in the blood (packed cell volume [PCV]) can drop as low as 8-10 percent, and the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration can be as low as 50 g/L. The normal PCV and Hb concentrations in horse blood are 28-44 percent and 112-169 g/L, respectively (3). Death is due to a severe lack of oxygen delivery to vital cells from hemolysis of red blood cells, anemia and the oxidation of hemoglobin to methemoglobin, which is incapable of transporting oxygen. Of 32 horses, 19 ( 60 percent) died after ingesting wilted red maple leaves. The clinical signs observed included: colic, fever, followed by laminitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation. All horses had both gross and microscopic evidence of hemoglobin in their urine (hemoglobinuria) (4).

Another _Acer_ plant, is the Box elder (_Acer negundo_). The tree seeds contain a toxin, which results in severe muscular disease in horses called seasonal atypical myopathy, which is frequently fatal.
