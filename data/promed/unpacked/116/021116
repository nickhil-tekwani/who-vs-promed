The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said on Thursday [6 Jan 2022] there had been a confirmed human case of avian flu in southwest England, adding that the person had been in close contact with infected birds and there was no evidence of onward transmission.

"The person acquired the infection from very close, regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time," the UKHSA said.

"All contacts of the individual, including those who visited the premises, have been traced and there is no evidence of onward spread of the infection to anyone else. The individual is currently well and self-isolating. The risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low."

A person in the south-west of England has been confirmed to have contracted avian flu, the UK Health Security Agency announced on Thursday [6 Jan 2022].

The agency said the person had been in close contact with infected birds and there was no evidence of onward transmission.

"The person acquired the infection from very close, regular contact with a large number of infected birds, which they kept in and around their home over a prolonged period of time," the UKHSA said.

"All contacts of the individual, including those who visited the premises, have been traced and there is no evidence of onward spread of the infection to anyone else. The individual is currently well and self-isolating. The risk to the wider public from avian flu continues to be very low."

Some strains of bird flu can pass from birds to people, but this is extremely rare, according to the UKHSA.

It usually requires close contact with an infected bird, so the risk to humans is generally considered very low.

Human-to-human transmission of bird flu is also very rare, the organisation said.

The case was detected after the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) identified an outbreak of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in a flock of birds.The infected birds have all been culled. As a precaution, the UKHSA swabbed the person involved and detected low levels of flu.

Further lab analysis showed that the virus was the "H5" type found in birds.

The UKHSA said that, at this point, it has not been possible to confirm that this is a H5N1 infection (the strain that is currently circulating in birds in the UK).

But the UKHSA has notified the World Health Organisation (WHO) as a precaution.

It said this is the first human case of this strain in the UK, although there have been cases elsewhere globally.

Professor Isabel Oliver, chief scientific officer at the UKHSA, said: "While the risk of avian flu to the general public is very low, we know that some strains do have the potential to spread to humans and that's why we have robust systems in place to detect these early and take action.

"Currently there is no evidence that this strain detected in the UK can spread from person to person, but we know that viruses evolve all the time and we continue to monitor the situation closely.

"We have followed up all of this individual's contacts and have not identified any onward spread."

In December [2021], environment secretary George Eustice revealed the UK had been hit by a record outbreak of avian flu that led to 500 000 captive birds being culled in previous months.

He told MPs an avian influenza prevention zone had been declared across the UK at the start of November [2021], requiring strict biosecurity measures and all birds to be kept indoors.

On Wednesday [5 Jan 2022], the World Organisation for Animal Health warned a wave of bird flu in Asia and Europe had a greater risk of spreading to humans because of a high number of variants.

The spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza has raised concern among governments and the poultry industry after previous outbreaks led to the culling of tens of millions of birds and trade restrictions.

"This time the situation is more difficult and more risky because we see more variants emerge, which make them harder to follow," director general Monique Eloit told Reuters.

"Eventually the risk is that it mutates or that it mixes with a human flu virus that can be transmitted between humans then suddenly it takes on a new dimension," she added.

Fifteen countries had reported outbreaks of bird flu in poultry between October [2021] and the end of December [2021], mostly the H5N1 strain. Italy was the worst hit in Europe with 285 outbreaks and nearly 4 million birds culled, data showed.

For contacts of an infected person who have the highest risk, the UKHSA contacts them daily to see if they have developed symptoms.

People are also offered anti-viral treatment after exposure to infected birds to stop the virus reproducing in their body.

Swabs are also carried out on people even if they do not have symptoms.

Professor Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick, said: "This is clearly going to be big news but the key thing is that human infections with H5N1 are really rare (fewer than 1000 worldwide since 2003) and they almost always occur as a result of direct, long-term contact with poultry.

"It can result in a nasty infection for the individual concerned but there has never been any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of H5N1 so at present I wouldn't consider this to be a significant public health risk."

Paul Wigley, professor of avian infection and immunity at the University of Liverpool, said: "Whilst avian influenza has the potential to be transmitted from poultry to humans, it is very rare and, as in this case, usually due to close and long-term contact with infected birds.

"Avian influenza such as the H5 serotype is largely adapted to infect birds and so is very unlikely to be transmitted from person to person.

"The advice given by APHA and UKHSA over contact with infected birds is sensible and should be followed. The risk of wider infection in the general public remains low."

[This is the first human case of avian Influenza A/H5N1 reported from the United Kingdom. In 2006, 20 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) were reported in Azerbaijan (8 cases) and Turkey (12 cases). WHO/Europe, with international partners, supported the governments of Azerbaijan and Turkey in responding to the outbreaks. No human cases have been observed in the WHO European Region since that time, despite continued surveillance for this and other zoonotic influenza viruses (https://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/communicable-diseases/influenza/zoonotic-influenza/old-links/human-infection-with-influenza-ah5n1).

All human cases infected with a novel influenza strain are notifiable in the EU under EU legislation and the International Health Regulations (IHR) through the Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) and IHR, respectively. Human infections with A(H5N1) are notifiable according to EU Decisions 2012/506/EU and 1082/2013/EU (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/zoonotic-influenza/facts/factsheet-h5n1).

This event overlaps the concurrent reports of a massive outbreak of avian influenza around the Solway Firth that has killed thousands of wildfowl in recent weeks, with over 4000 barnacle goose particularly affected/died, which equates to around 10% of the entire Svalbard population of the species (Avian influenza (09): Europe (UK) wild bird, HPAI, conservation concern 20220106.8700696).

The primary risk factor for human infection with avian influenza is direct or indirect exposure to infected poultry (live or dead) or wildlife, as well as contaminated environments such as live bird markets. Additional risk factors include slaughtering, defeathering, handling carcasses of infected poultry, and preparing poultry for consumption, especially in household settings.

Given the potential zoonotic risk with this new case, contingency plans for the control of avian influenza in poultry and birds should be reviewed and implemented. Public health and animal health authorities must ensure that persons at risk are sufficiently protected from infection and appropriate measures are taken to prevent widespread transmission.

Due to the constantly evolving nature of influenza viruses, WHO continues to stress the importance of global surveillance to detect virological, epidemiological, and clinical changes associated with circulating influenza viruses that may affect human or animal health, as well as timely sharing of viruses to inform risk assessments. - Mod.UBA
