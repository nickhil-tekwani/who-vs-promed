Black pod disease due to heavy rain in Ivory Coast's western and south-western regions has damaged about 1/5 of the [national] cocoa crop. Ivory Coast [is] the world's top producer with over 1.5 million tonnes annually.

Farmers are not allowed to sell beans touched by rot, which damages the quality if it does not destroy them. "Right now we think (the disease) affects around 1/3 of the harvest in the west and southwest, but that could rise if the rain continues," said a cocoa buyer.

The disease is evident on plantations. A farmer said half of his most recent harvest is rotten. Other farmers could not assess the full extent of the damage, but all said they had been affected.

[Black pod (also called _Phytophthora_ pod rot) is the primary fungal disease affecting cocoa worldwide. In Africa, the fungus-like pathogens _Phytophthora palmivora_ and _P. megakarya_ are associated with it, but 2 additional species are found in the Americas. _P. palmivora_ is the most common pathogen and can cause yield losses as high as 95 per cent in very humid climates, with every pod affected. Pods progressively turn dark brown. Losses are most severe when pods are infected during the 2 months prior to ripening. The disease also causes stem cankers, which are estimated to kill up to 10 per cent of trees annually.

Black pod is spread by insect activity, mechanical means, plant debris, water, and wind. Multiple infections from several sources may occur in plantations, with epiphytotics developing from a series of foci simultaneously. Genetic resistance is generally low in commercial cocoa cultivars. Disease management is difficult and needs an integrated approach, including cultural techniques, phytosanitary measures, and targeted fungicide use.

To prevent problems with rain wash-off of foliar fungicides, trunk injections with phosphorous compounds have been shown to be an effective alternative. However, like chemical sprays, they need to be repeated whenever protection is required. Similar methods are being used in the control of _P. cinnamomi_ diseases in some tree species, for example jarrah dieback and avocado root rot in Australia. The mode of the protective action of these compounds against _Phytophthora_ species is still being investigated.
