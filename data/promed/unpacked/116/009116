A few minutes ago, the Public Health Institute (ISP) confirmed a case positive for [a] hantavirus [infection] in Maule, making it the 3rd case so far in 2016.

The case is a 6-year-old boy who was taken to the Regional Hospital in Talca, where he is in stable condition in the intensive care unit.

The Regional Government Health Secretariat reminds all about the measures to prevent [exposure to hantaviruses]:
- Select clean areas and pastures free of brush for campsites,
- Keep food in strong, closed containers,
- Keep trash in closed containers,
- Avoid collecting wild fruits,
- Ventilate places closed for a long time for 30 min,
- Eliminate rodents and close up houses and storage buildings.

[The 2 previous cases of hantavirus infection this year (2016) were a 60-year-old housewife who was infected in the Miraflores area, Linares community, and a 33-year-old agricultural worker (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20160121.3953221).

The Maule region is endemic for Andes hantavirus. The above report provides little information about the circumstances under which the boy acquired his hantavirus infection, but it may have been due to exposure to rodent reservoir hosts of the virus or to virus-contaminated rodent excreta. Cases of human hantavirus infections occur fairly frequently in the endemic region of the central and southern coastal areas of Chile.

Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in these cases no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person-to-person and then only with very close physical contact, usually within the family.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg.
