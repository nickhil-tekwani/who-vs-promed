[Italy had been classified as rabies-free since 1997. In October
2008, 2 foxes were diagnosed with rabies in the Province of Udine,
northeast Italy. One case of human exposure caused by a bite from one
of the foxes occurred and was properly treated. Since then, the
disease has spread within the regional fox population, eventually
leading to the need for the application of wildlife oral vaccination
described above.
