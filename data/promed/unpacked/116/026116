9 sheep die of Anthrax in Mongolia
-----------------------------------
Anthrax has been confirmed to be the cause of the deaths of 9 sheep in the
Orhon county of Mongolia's Bulgan province in early July, said the
Mongolian General Authority for Emergency Management (GAEM) Tuesday. A
press officer of the GAEM said that a herder in Bulgan province's Bugat
county was diagnosed with anthrax in late June. He is now in hospital and
in stable condition.
The Bulgan province has enforced martial law in Orhon and Bugat counties
and is disinfecting affected regions. The GAEM is inspecting the products
from Bulgan province to avoid the spread of the infectious and usually
fatal disease, which mainly affects warm-blooded animals, especially cattle
and sheep.

[As this is a disease normally occurring in livestock, it is probable that
the shepherd's disease and hospitalisation triggered a retrospective
veterinary investigation revealing the ongoing cases in sheep reported
here. This disease can be missed when it involves just the occasional dead
sheep. Such are not considered worth following up. As a result the ground
continues to be recontaminated and the pitter-patter of sporadic cases
continues until events conspire to trigger an epidemic. Then an expensive
fuss ensues. It would be cheaper if these sporadic cases were properly and
promptly disposed of (i.e., burnt, or buried even, before scavengers get at
the carcass and initiate a significant sporulation and ground
contamination), as this would reduce the chances of grazing animals later
coming upon spores, ingesting them in the graze, and dying. - Mod.MHJ]
