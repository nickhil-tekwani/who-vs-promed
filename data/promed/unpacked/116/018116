When a few dogs started coughing at a Texas animal shelter in October [2022], veterinarians were not initially alarmed. The shelter, Operation Kindness, had seen its share of sick dogs.

But these coughs seemed to linger, and the handful of hacking dogs soon turned into dozens. By mid-November [2022], 86% of the shelter's roughly 150 dogs were ill.

"This was just so fast-acting," said Ed Jamison, the chief executive of Operation Kindness, which is based in Carrollton, just north of Dallas.

Laboratory testing revealed that the dogs had contracted a highly contagious strain of canine influenza, known as H3N2, which has caused a spate of recent outbreaks across the South. Veterinarians have warned clients about the virus on social media, doggy day care facilities have closed, and shelters, including Operation Kindness, have suspended adoptions.

The virus, which has caused periodic outbreaks in the United States since 2015, does not currently pose a risk to humans, experts stressed, and most dogs that contract it do not become severely ill. But the disease can progress to pneumonia, or even be fatal, in a small percentage of dogs.

Although canine influenza can flare up at any time, the recent rash of cases could be fueled, in part, by recent changes in Americans' behaviors, some veterinarians suggested. Shelters that emptied out during the pandemic are full again, they said, and the resurgence of travel and reopening of offices means that more dogs are spending time together in kennels and at day care, where the virus can easily gain a foothold.

"We had a bit of a quiet period during the 1st couple years of COVID," said Dr. Silene St. Bernard, the regional medical director for Southern California at VCA Animal Hospitals. "While people were home, their pets were home. And we didn't see as many of these contagious viruses spreading around."

Experts are urging dog owners to remain alert for symptoms -- which may include coughing, fever, and loss of appetite -- especially if the virus has been reported in their area. And those whose dogs spend time in social settings may want to consider a canine influenza vaccine.

"You need to think about what risks you take," said Edward Dubovi, a virologist at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine who was part of the team that identified the 1st strain of canine influenza. "If you go to a dog park -- we have one here in Ithaca, and there may be 30 or 40 dogs running around in there -- that's a risk. If that's part of your daily routine, and flu is in the area, then you just might want to go get a vaccine."

There are 2 strains of canine influenza. The 1st, known as H3N8, originated in horses and was first detected in Florida among greyhounds in 2004.

But the most recent outbreaks have been caused by H3N2, which originated in birds. It was initially detected in dogs in South Korea in 2007, although it began circulating earlier, and spread in several countries in Asia.

In 2015, it showed up in Chicago, tearing through kennels, veterinary clinics, and animal shelters. "In the shelter setting, flu is not super subtle because it comes in like a tidal wave," said Dr. Sandra Newbury, who directs the University of Wisconsin Shelter Medicine Program. (Dr. Newbury, who was part of the team that responded to and studied the Chicago outbreak, has also been working with Operation Kindness in recent weeks.)

The virus spread through the Midwest and seeded additional outbreaks across the country before eventually fading out.

H3N2 has been reintroduced to the United States numerous times since, research suggests. (Regulations surrounding the importation of dogs are "minimal," said Dr. Dubovi, adding that the Healthy Dog Importation Act, introduced in Congress last year [2021], would impose more safeguards.)

Canine influenza, which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and aerosols, tends to spread quickly in group settings and can jump between states as infected dogs travel.

"There's a tendency to move animals from one part of the country to another, or from one shelter to another," said Colin Parrish, a virologist at Cornell's College of Veterinary Medicine and an expert on canine influenza. "So the virus gets moved along with the dogs."

The number of cases of the canine flu are surging in dogs. Cats as well.

The illness has closed shelters and doggy day-care businesses in Texas and elsewhere, mostly across the South, and forced some groups to suspend adoptions until they could stop its spread.

Exactly how many dogs have gotten sick is not known because there is no official tally of cases across the country, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. Dog flu is not a disease that must be reported.

Cases have also been found this year [2022] in Alabama, Michigan, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Tennessee, the association says.

Although highly contagious among pets, dog flu does not pose a danger to humans, and most animals recover.

But if you want to try to spare your pets, here's what to watch for.

What is dog flu?
Like the human variety, canine, or dog, flu is a contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. One type of virus, H3N8, was first reported in horses and then, in 2004 in Florida, in racing greyhounds. It is thought to have jumped from horses to dogs, and since then has been found in most states and the District of Columbia, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Another type, H3N2, caused a rash of cases in Chicago kennels in 2015. Before being discovered in the United States, it was seen in dogs in 2006-2007 in Asia and probably was the result of an avian or bird flu virus transmitted to dogs, the veterinary medical association says. In 2016, a group of shelter cats in Indiana was diagnosed with it. The following year [2017] it also was found in dogs in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.

How is it spread?
Dog flu is transmitted by coughing, barking, and sneezing, through droplets or aerosols, the veterinary medical association says. Dog in shelters and day-care centers and at groomers are especially at risk. The virus can spread on food and water bowls and on collars and leashes, or through people having had contact with an infected dog.

How long can the virus survive?
The virus can remain alive and able to infect dogs for up to 48 hours on surfaces, 24 hours on clothing, and 12 hours on someone's hands. Most cases of H3N8 appear 2 to 3 days after exposure, though the virus has an incubation period of up to 5 days. For H3N2, dogs may show signs of infection between 2 and 3 days afterward. Dogs are most contagious during the incubation period.

What are the signs of dog flu?
The most common sign is a cough persisting for 10 to 21 days, even with treatment with antibiotics and cough suppressants, according to the veterinary medical association. Coughs can be moist or dry. Other signs: nasal or eye discharges, sneezing, lethargy, loss of appetite, or fever. Almost all dogs exposed to the viruses become infected, with about 80% showing signs. The other 20% can still spread the virus.

Dogs can show signs of pneumonia, and although most dogs recover, some deaths have been reported.

Cats also have nasal discharges, congestion, and excessive salivation.

Tests can identify which strains of the virus are present.

How is dog flu treated?
Most dogs recover in 2 to 3 weeks, but pneumonia, dehydration, and other infections might require additional treatment. Those could include antimicrobials for bacterial infections, medications to reduce fevers, and fluids for dehydration.

Infected dogs should be isolated [away from other animals - Mod.TG] for 4 weeks.

Antiviral drugs used to treat flu are approved only for humans.

Are there vaccines available?
Yes, vaccines are available for dogs both H3N8 and H3N2. A bivalent vaccine protects against both strains.

But there are no vaccines approved for cats.

["The H3N8 equine influenza virus has been recognized in horses for more than 40 years. In 2004, the H3N8 influenza virus or 'flu' appears to have 'jumped' from horses to dogs. The virus had mutated into a form known as canine influenza virus (CIV) that is highly infective for dogs. At first, veterinarians thought the H3N8 canine flu would be quite lethal. Fortunately, like the human flu virus, it kills very few healthy individuals. Since its detection in 2004, H3N8 canine influenza has been detected in most states. The disease was discovered by Dr. Cynda Crawford from the University of Florida, and she estimated the H3N8 strain kills between 1% and 5% of dogs contracting it, with most of the deaths being in dogs having serious concurrent illnesses. That's nothing to sneeze at. The 1918 Spanish flu had a mortality rate of only 2%.

"In March of 2015, a new strain of influenza in the United States was identified (H3N2) in Chicago during an outbreak of respiratory illness. Prior to this, the H3N2 strain of canine influenza had only been identified in Asia after jumping from birds to dogs. After its initial detection, cases of H3N2 influenza were reported in many states and a few provinces in Canada. The strain was even detected in a group of shelter cats that were exposed to infected dogs. A more recent outbreak was reported by the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine in May 2017. By mid-June [2017], H3N2 infections had been reported in many other states, including the Carolinas, Texas, and Illinois. The severity of H3N2 may be greater than other respiratory infections, especially in those dogs with higher risk of infection. Similar to H3N8 infection, the risk of mortality with H3N2 infection is low.

"Currently, there are approved CIV vaccines in the United States and Canada. Vaccination against canine flu should be considered for any at-risk breed, dogs with heart or respiratory conditions, dogs that travel or show, and those having extensive contact with other dogs (e.g., those that are boarded [or go to dog parks, shows, etc. - Mod.TG]).

"The [signs] of canine influenza are similar to the human flu: cough, runny nose, and fever. The most common clinical sign associated with canine influenza is a cough that does not respond to antibiotic or cough suppressant therapy and lasts 10-21 days. This cough may be productive ('moist') or non-productive ('dry'), and it may be associated with reduced appetite and lethargy. The majority of dogs infected with canine influenza will display mild clinical signs. Dogs infected with the H3N2 strain of canine influenza appear to be at greater risk of developing more severe clinical signs.

"The CI virus is virtually identical to other respiratory infections such as kennel cough. In fact, many cases of CIV may be mistaken as kennel cough or other infections in the canine infectious respiratory disease (CIRD) complex because of these similarities. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing canine influenza from CIRD, any dog with these clinical signs should be seen by a veterinarian.

"Older dogs and dogs with heart and respiratory conditions are at particular risk for CIV. Dogs with short, flat faces (brachycephalic breeds), such as Boston terriers, boxers, Pekingese, pugs, and shih tzus, are also at higher risk."

"Due to its similarities to other respiratory infections, canine influenza cannot be diagnosed on clinical signs alone. If a veterinarian sees a dog within the 1st few days of the onset of clinical signs, a nasal swab for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test can be submitted to a veterinary diagnostic lab. If the PCR test is positive, the dog most likely has CIV. After 4 days of illness, PCR results are less likely to be accurate (there may be false-negative results). At this stage, blood testing for CIV antibodies should be performed. This type of testing, called serology, involves comparing antibody levels 2-3 weeks apart. If antibody levels rise significantly over this period, it indicates active CIV infection. Your veterinarian may also wish to run other diagnostics such as blood work and radiographs to assess the severity of infection.

"Any dog suspected of having the CIV should be tested to determine if the disease is spreading in your area. If there are confirmed canine influenza virus cases in your area, consult with your veterinarian and consider vaccinating your dog."

"It is important to note the CIV vaccine cannot completely prevent the disease. It may, however, reduce the severity and duration of clinical signs associated with infection. This is especially important in at-risk dogs and to help reduce the spread of outbreaks.

"Talk to your veterinarian to determine if vaccinating against canine influenza is right for your dog.

"As with nearly all viral infections, treatment is largely supportive. It is important that your pet be kept in a warm, dry area away from other dogs, fed a high-quality diet, and kept well hydrated during illness. Good nutrition and husbandry are crucial in ensuring that dogs mount an adequate immune response and can help promote faster recovery. Dogs affected with a mild form of canine influenza will often develop a secondary bacterial upper respiratory infection. These dogs typically have a thick green mucous discharge from their nose and benefit from broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. Dogs that develop pneumonia may require hospitalization, intravenous fluids and medications, and potent broad-spectrum antibiotics. Most dogs fully recover from canine influenza within 2-3 weeks. It is important to consult with your veterinarian to determine the best course of treatment. Dogs exposed to the virus should be isolated for 4 weeks to prevent further spread.

"Virtually 100% of dogs exposed to CIV will become infected. For this reason, it is important that owners of dogs diagnosed with the virus keep them away from other dogs. This includes trips to the groomer or dog parks and contact with other dogs during walks and in kennels. Clothing, equipment, floors, and hands should be thoroughly cleaned with soap and water after contact with any dog with signs of respiratory illness."

Owners should heed the warning and get their pets vaccinated. Activities that include other dogs such as play dates or visits to the groomers, dog parks, or boarding facilities make it critical for the owner to get their dog vaccinated. Prevention is much easier on the pet, the pet parent, and the finances of the pet parent.

If there is more information on specific strains of this flu, please share it with ProMED. - Mod.TG]
