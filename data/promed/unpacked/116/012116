Bovine ephemeral fever [BEF] continues to cause high morbidity in unvaccinated beef cattle herds in the region north of the Sea of Galilee (Lake Kinneret) and in the Hula valley. The disease affects also (morbidity, 5-25 percent) unvaccinated dairy farms along the eastern shore of Lake Kinneret and in the northern part of the Jordan Valley (south of Lake Kinneret, along the west bank of the Jordan river).

In young cattle, the clinical signs may at times be severe, including diarrhea, while postmortem findings include DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) and some yellow coloration of fasciae surrounding muscles.

It should be remembered that the incidence of vector-borne BEF is weather-dependent; in the past, there have been episodes of disease continuing to December.

[The laboratory for Viral Diagnostics at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan, Israel, has been assisting the field practitioners and confirmed BEF from collected samples since 14 Jul 2014. Details of the investigations and their accumulated results will be helpful.

The affected zone is to be seen in sections 1, 3 and 5 on the interactive map at http://www.eyeonisrael.com/Israel-touring-map.html. The affected areas border Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. Hopefully, surveillance is applied in those countries; results to be welcomed. The disease is known to have circulated in the past in most of the regional countries, including Egypt, Iraq and Turkey.

BEF is a debilitating, and sometimes fatal, viral disease of cattle and water buffalo. Also called 3-day sickness (and various other local names), it is enzootic in tropical and sub-tropical regions of Africa, Asia and Australia, surging seasonally into temperate zones in sometimes extensive epizootics. It does not occur in most of Europe, the Pacific Islands or the Americas, where it is considered a significant exotic disease threat. The causative agent, bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV), is an arthropod-borne rhabdovirus (genus _Ephemerovirus_, family _Rhabdoviridae_). The disease is clinically manifested by transient anorexia, hyperpnoea, a sudden reduction in milk yield, fever (40-41 deg C) lasting for 2-4 days, seromucoid nasal discharge and occasionally lacrimation, recumbency and sometimes lameness mainly affecting the hind limbs. Mortality is usually low (less than 5 percent).

Although the disease is non-contagious and the epizootiology is consistent with insect-borne transmission, the vectors of BEF are not well defined. The virus has been isolated from both mosquitoes and biting midges (_Culicoides_ spp) in Australia and Africa, but various factors suggest that mosquitoes are the principal vectors. Only one BEFV serotype exists worldwide, and infection apparently leads to life-long immunity.

BEF is not zoonotic and is not included in OIE's list of notifiable animal diseases. However, in view of its economic significance, it has been reported in the past to the OIE as an exceptional event (i.e., Tajikistan, 2002).
