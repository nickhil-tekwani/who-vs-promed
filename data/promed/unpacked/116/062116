Paragraph 5 of this report contains an error. With type A influenza
having 16 major varieties of hemagglutinin recognized (not too long
ago only 15 had been encountered) and 9 major varieties of
neuraminidase, there are a possible 144 influenza A subtypes, not 1454
strains as stated in the text.

Thanks to antigenic drift and the potential for reassortment, the
possible number of strains is innumerable.
