'Mad cow' fears prompt Britain to recall polio vaccine
---------------------------------------------
Britain's health ministry announced Friday a recall of a polio vaccine
now in use because of fears that the vaccine could transmit the human
variant of 'mad cow' disease. But health chiefs said the risk of
transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) through the
Medeva vaccine given to British children and travelers was "incalculably
small." Britain's Department of Health said the recall affected only one
brand of polio vaccine, which was scheduled to be replaced, but did not
specify the quantity of vaccine that is being recalled. "As the national
supply of polio vaccine has already switched to a different
manufacturer, the impact of the recall on the polio vaccination program
is likely to be minimal," a spokesman said.
Britain's Chief Medical Officer, Liam Donaldson, wrote to all family
doctors Friday to tell them about the recall. He said the risk to humans
of catching CJD - the human form of BSE which appeared in Britain in
1986 - was "incalculably small." Medeva manufactures the vaccine being
recalled. SmithKline Beecham will provide a replacement vaccine. The
BBC reported that the recall is linked to the presence of calf fetuses in
the vaccine. European rules say oral medicines should not use bovine
materials from countries in which there are known cases of BSE.
