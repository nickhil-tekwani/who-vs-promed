The [Taiwan] Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced yesterday [9
Jul 2010] that 3 more cases of Japanese encephalitis [JE] had been
reported in Taiwan, bringing the number to 14 this year [2010]. One
of the 3 confirmed cases was acquired overseas, marking the 1st
imported case of Japanese encephalitis this year, CDC deputy
director-general Chou Jih-haw said.

A 52-year-old man living in Miaoli County fell ill 14 Jun [2010] soon
after he returned from a business trip to China's Guangdong Province,
Chou said. The man first sought medial treatment for a headache at a
clinic, but turned to a hospital in Taipei City after his illness
became worse, Chou said, adding that the man was released from the
hospital on 8 Jul [2010]. Doctors determined the businessman was
infected with the mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus during
his stay in Guangdong, a known risk area, Chou said.

Chou said another patient -- a male in Pingtung County -- remains in
an intensive ward after developing symptoms of Japanese encephalitis
on 29 Jun [2010].

The 3rd case is a man in Hualien County who visited a clinic on 27
Jun [2010] with a headache and a fever. On 1 Jul [2010], he was
rushed to a hospital because of continuous high fever, and he is
still being treated at the hospital, Chou said.

[As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20060909.2565, Taiwan is within
the broad geographical endemic JE belt that extends from South Asia
through Southeast Asia, East Asia, and the northern tip of Australia.
JE is the main cause of viral encephalitis in Asia, with 30 000-50
000 cases reported annually. The virus is a member of the flavivirus
family and is closely related to St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile viruses.

Although most JE virus infections are inapparent, they can progress
to encephalitis and death, with neurological sequelae in some of
those who survive. The virus is maintained in birds and transmitted
by _Culex_ mosquitoes. Swine may serve as amplifying hosts.

There are 2 JE virus vaccines available, an attenuated product (SA
14-14-2) manufactured in China and an inactivated one (Biken) from
Japan. A JE fact sheet published by the US CDC can be found at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/jencephalitis/facts.htm>.
