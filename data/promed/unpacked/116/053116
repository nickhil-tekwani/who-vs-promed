Influenza update 125 (14 Jan 2011) -- summary
---------------------------------------------
North America is continuing to report increases in influenza activity
primarily related to influenza A (H3N2) with lower numbers of influenza
type B. In the United Kingdom, severe and fatal cases are increased
compared with 2 weeks ago, associated predominantly with influenza A (H1N1)
2009 and less commonly with influenza type B. Currently, 25 per cent of
intensive care beds in the UK are occupied by influenza patients. Notably,
the chief medical officer has issued an alert to clinicians, warning of
increasing rates of bacterial infections often associated with influenza
(_S. pneumoniae_, Group A streptococcus, and meningococcus), though the
association with the current influenza circulation is still under
investigation. Severe disease associated with H1N1 (2009) and to a lesser
extent influenza type B is also being increasingly reported on the European
continent and areas of the Middle East. Tropical areas of the world and the
temperate countries of the Southern Hemisphere are currently reporting very
little influenza circulation.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
North America
Rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) and hospital admissions due to
influenza continue to increase in Canada. The rate of ILI reporting is
similar to influenza seasons prior to 2009. About 25 per cent of specimens
tested in Canada are positive for influenza and influenza type A makes up
about 98 per cent of influenza detections. Of the influenza type A viruses
characterized, 94 per cent are H3N2 and the other 6 per cent, H1N1 (2009).
In the United States (US), the proportion of outpatient visits due to ILI
decreased slightly in the last week, perhaps due to the holiday season, but
remains slightly above the epidemic threshold. 6 US states are reporting
high ILI activity. Rates of death due to pneumonia and influenza from a
sentinel surveillance system that includes data from 122 cities across the
country are below the epidemic threshold. About 20 per cent of clinical
specimens tested in the last week of 2009 were positive for influenza. In
contrast to the situation in Canada, about a third (34.1 per cent) of
influenza detections in the US are type B and two-thirds are type A. Of the
influenza type A viruses that have been sub-typed, 86 per cent are H3N2 and
the other 14 per cent are H1N1 (2009). As in previous weeks, all of the
influenza A and 91 per cent of the influenza type B viruses characterized
antigenically are of the same lineages as contained in the current seasonal
influenza vaccine.

Europe
The United Kingdom (UK) continues to report high rates of ILI and
influenza-related hospitalizations. Currently about 25 per cent of
intensive care beds are occupied by influenza cases and 112
influenza-related deaths have been reported. 95 of 100 fatal cases from
which the virus has been sub-typed have been H1N1 (2009) related and the
other 5, influenza type B. The majority of severe and fatal cases have been
between the ages of 15 and 64 years; only 16 per cent of fatal cases were
over the age of 64 years. 78 per cent of the fatal cases for which there
are data had an underlying risk condition. Of note, the chief medical
officer of the UK has issued an alert to clinicians noting recent increases
in some bacterial infections that are sometimes seen as co-infections with
influenza, particularly _S. pneumoniae_, invasive Group A streptococcus,
and meningococcal disease. The association of this increase with the
current influenza transmission is unclear and is under investigation. 2 per
cent (17/811) H1N1 (2009) viruses tested in the UK have been found to carry
the H275Y mutation which confers resistance to the antiviral drug
oseltamivir. Elsewhere in the European Region there have been increasing
numbers of hospitalized cases and deaths associated with influenza A (H1N1)
and influenza B virus infections in several countries. France, Portugal,
the Netherlands, and Denmark have all reported deaths and cases admitted to
intensive care. The percentage of intensive care beds occupied by influenza
cases in Denmark has reached 4 per cent, which is as high as it was during
the peak of the 2009/2010 influenza season. The pattern seen in severe
cases in continental Europe is similar to that seen in the UK primarily
affecting adults between the ages of 15 and 64 years with 60-80 per cent
reporting a history of underlying risk factors. In areas where H1N1 (2009)
and type B viruses are co-circulating in the community, H1N1 (2009) appears
to be disproportionately detected in the severe cases. Overall, 45 per cent
of specimens tested from sentinel sites in Europe were positive for
influenza virus, an increase from previous reports. 77 per cent of
influenza viruses were type A and 23 per cent, influenza type B. Of the 307
influenza A viruses that were sub-typed, 85 per cent were H1N1 (2009) 15
per cent were H3N2.

North Africa and the Middle East
Several countries of North Africa and the Middle East are also experiencing
increases in influenza activity. Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia have had
modestly increased levels of influenza detections in the last 2 to 3 weeks.
Influenza type B has been the predominant virus reported with lesser
amounts of H1N1 (2009). Limited data suggests that H1N1 (2009) is
circulating in Egypt where 122 H1N1 (2009) related deaths have been
reported since October 2010. Iran and Pakistan have also had a steady
increase in influenza detection in the same period of time with the
majority of viruses being H1N1 (2009).

North Asia
The temperate areas of Asia, including Mongolia, northern China, the
Republic of Korea, and Japan have all reported slight increases in
respiratory disease activity in recent weeks. In Mongolia and northern
China, the increase in activity was associated with influenza A (H3N2),
which appears to have peaked around the 3rd week of December [2010].
However, in the Republic of Korea, very little H3N2 was detected; over 90
per cent of influenza viruses reported there were H1N1 (2009). Japan had
earlier detections of H3N2 coinciding with those of Mongolia and northern
China but more recently, H1N1 (2009) has become the predominant virus
detected there.

Countries in the tropical zone
------------------------------
Very little transmission of influenza viruses is currently being reported
in tropical regions of the world. Previously reported circulation of H3N2
in Paraguay, though still elevated, continues to decline. Elsewhere in the
topical areas of the Americas, levels of influenza detection are low. In
Asia, the previously reported surge in severe H1N1 (2009) related cases in
Sri Lanka is decreasing for the last 4 weeks. Other countries in the region
and extending into South East Asia report only small numbers of influenza
virus detections and no increases in respiratory disease activity. A
mixture of viruses is being reported with influenza type B and (H1N1) 2009
being the most common types in most countries. No new information is
available this week from sub-Saharan Africa. Madagascar, however, has been
experiencing moderate levels of circulation of H3N2 and lesser amounts of
influenza type B for several weeks.

Countries in the temperate zone of the Southern Hemisphere
----------------------------------------------------------
The countries of the southern temperate regions of the world have had very
little influenza transmission since the end of their winter season [2010].
Australia is the notable exception with persistence of small numbers of
H3N2 and influenza type B viruses.

Virological surveillance - FluNet reports
-----------------------------------------
During this reporting period (weeks 49 to 52 -- 6 Dec 2010-2 Jan 2011),
National Influenza Centres (NICs) from 71 countries, areas or territories
reported data to FluNet*. A total of 18 757 specimens were reported as
positive for influenza viruses, 14 423 (76.9 per cent) were typed as
influenza A and 4335 (23.1 per cent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed
influenza A viruses reported, 53.2 per cent were influenza H1N1(2009) and
46.7 per cent were influenza A (H3N2).

[As of the week ending 14 Jan 2011 influenza activity in the northern
hemisphere has increased, particularly in Europe, with A (H1N1) and B
viruses predominating. In contrast in Asia and North America influenza A
(H3N2) and B viruses have predominated during the same period. Overall the
previous H1N1 seasonal strain has been largely replaced by the 2009
pandemic H1N1 strain. As in previous weeks, all of the influenza A viruses
and 91 per cent of the influenza type B viruses characterized antigenically
are of the same lineages as contained in the current seasonal influenza
vaccine.

In the Southern Hemisphere, with the exception of Australia, there has been
very little influenza transmission since the end of their winter season
(2010). - Mod.CP]
