According to a number of local Lithuanian media reports, several dead wild boars have been found in Alytus county. According to one of them, the State Food and Veterinary Service of Lithuania [SFVS] already registered the 1st outbreaks of African swine fever (ASF) on its territory but has still not disclosed any information as it is concerned about the consequent economic effect.

The Department of Food and Veterinary Service of the Alytus area confirmed the mortality, adding that it is too early to say what its cause is. Samples of the carcasses of the dead wild boars have been sent to laboratories and the results are expected soon.
