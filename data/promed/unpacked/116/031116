Gipuzkoa recorded an outbreak of measles after a decade with no
transmission
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the last 2 months there have been 21 cases in Gipuzkoa [a province
of the Basque country], including "children and young adults." Of the
20 affected by the virus 2 patients were admitted to hospital with
complications. A total of 18 infected "were not vaccinated." This
resurgence has alerted the health authorities to a disease that seemed
almost forgotten. Gipuzkoa had seen only a single case of measles
during the last decade. 9 of the 21 infections occurred in Gipuzkoa
between 7 Jan and 14 Apr 2011, an outbreak that, according to sources,
"came from an unvaccinated boy studying in Hendaye and living in Irun.
"All cases occurred in the indigenous population, and not among
newcomers as agents of transmission," according to Miren Dorronsoro,
head of the Epidemiology Unit of the Public Health Department of
Gipuzkoa.

The situation in Gipuzkoa is a reflection of the situation in the
whole state, which suffered only 2 cases of measles in 2004 and so far
this year has had more than 1300 cases. The Epidemiology Unit of
Gipuzkoa suspects that the outbreak recorded in the territory
originated from France where this year 6 people have died and 300 have
suffered severe pneumonia among more than 5000 affected.

Dorronsoro stated that although vaccination protection is high in
Gipuzkoa, every year about 5 percent of families refuse or avoid
vaccination on philosophical grounds. The Basque Autonomous Community
(BAC) has created an Advisory Committee on Vaccines for Children to
remedy this situation.

Algeria: Outbreak of measles in M'sila -- 417 cases reported
------------------------------------------------------------
A measles outbreak which began in January [2011] in a score of
Communes in Southern Wilaya M'sila [district], affected 417 people (28
seriously) by May, the Director of Health and Population reported on
Wednesday [8 Jun 2011]. The age of those affected by the outbreak of
measles are 0 to 4 years (212 cases) and 20 to 44 years (126 cases),
according to the official, adding that the outbreak has been contained
by the efforts of the department's hospital in the Boussaada region,
home to more than half of the registered cases.

Immunisation of patients and their contacts was carried out involving
a total of 1626 people of whom 1346 were adults. Besides taking care
of patients, an epidemiologic investigation was initiated to determine
the cause of this high frequency of cases, together with a catch-up
vaccination programme against measles, especially in schools.

Drop in cases of measles in Mozambique
--------------------------------------
Mozambican health authorities have reported in the 1st 5 months of
this year 137 suspected cases of measles across the country, of which
55 were declared positive, down from 188 reported in the same period
in 2010.

According to the spokesperson of the Health Ministry, Leonardo
Chavana, measles was reported in several provinces. However, the
central province of Manica is a major concern for the government
because members of a local religious sect refuse to support the
vaccination programmes. Chavana explained that the Health Ministry has
decided to deploy a team to that province to sensitise the members of
the sect to the importance of their participation in vaccination
programmes, "as a means not to compromise the growth of their
children. It is wrong for a parent to endanger the life of his/her
children because of a lack of a vaccination. The Health Ministry
respects any social, ideological, religious or cultural belief, but
will never respect decisions that endanger the lives of children,"
stressed Chavana.

Manica [province] shares a long border with Zimbabwe, a country
where, according to international media reports, there are thousands
of measles cases each year which result in death of hundreds of
children.

Official statistics indicate that during the 1st 5 months of 2010
there were 405 suspected measles cases investigated in Mozambique. The
health authorities collected 397 samples for laboratory tests,
resulting in 188 confirmed cases. The overall rate of measles was 5.4
cases per 100 000 inhabitants, which was higher than the recommended
rate set by the World Health Organization (WHO) of 2 cases per 100 000
inhabitants. In the provinces where no major outbreaks of measles were
reported, namely Gaza, Inhambane and the capital Maputo, all in the
southern region of Mozambique, the rate of detection was 1.7 per 100
000 inhabitants during the period under review.

Currently, the Health Ministry is making efforts to increase the rate
of vaccination against measles and remains on alert due to outbreaks
of measles recently reported in neighbouring countries, particularly
South Africa, Zimbabwe and Malawi.

Measles infection kills 2 children in camp near El Geneina
----------------------------------------------------------
Measles infection led to the death of 2 children in the camp of Abuz
near the city of El Geneina in West Darfur during the 2 days 5 and 6
Jun 2011. A sheikh from the camp told Radio Dabanga that they are
afraid that the very contagious disease would spread, especially in
the light of lack of any effort to prevent or contain the disease. He
also stated that the ANC [African National Congress] medical
organization which was working in the camp announced that it has ended
its work in the camp. The camp lacks any other medical organization.

The sheikh said that they have held a meeting with the Minister of
Health who informed them that the Ministry does not have any
medication [vaccine?] for the disease. Dr. Wali Eldeen Elfaki, a
pediatric specialist, called on to the citizens to avoid crowded
places to avoid getting infected by the disease, which he said is
transmitted through breathing.

http://lavalnews.ca/article/Outbreak-of-Measles-declared%20-191104


Outbreak of Measles declared in Quebec
--------------------------------------
Measles virus is transmitted by just being breathed in. Just sharing
space with someone who is infected can be enough to become infected.
Measles is a highly contagious disease. In Quebec, it [has been] rare
because of extensive vaccination programs. All the same, since the
beginning of 2011 cases of measles have been confirmed in several
regions.

The Public Health Office at the Agence de la sante et des services
sociaux de Laval would like to make Laval residents aware that the
virus may be present in situations where people haven't been
adequately vaccinated.

The main symptoms of this illness are an overall feeling of sickness,
a high fever, and the eruption of red spots on the skin. Persons with
compromised immunity, children less than a year old, and pregnant
women who have not been vaccinated have a higher risk of developing
complications.

How can you know if you should be vaccinated? Vaccination is the best
way to protect one's self against the measles. Quebec's vaccination
calendar allows for the administration of a dose of vaccine against
measles, rubella and mumps at the age of 12 months and 18 months.

The following information may be useful for evaluating your
circumstances and those of a child: Persons born before 1970 are
considered safe from measles since the illness was common at that
time. Persons born from 1970 to 1979 are also not considered at risk,
if they received at least one dose of vaccine. Persons born in 1980 or
after are regarded as safe if they received 2 doses of vaccine.

The Public Health Office invites residents of Laval whose vaccination
against measles may not be complete to get in contact with the nearest
branch of the Centre de sante et de services sociaux de Laval to make
an appointment in order to be vaccinated. If there is doubt, it is
also possible to call Info-Sante (811) or a personal physician. It
should be noted that vaccination is safe and free.

Quebec measles outbreak worsens
-------------------------------
Health authorities call for vaccinations as the number of reported
cases grows. Quebec's director of public health is urging people to
get vaccinated following an outbreak of more than 250 cases of measles
in the province since the beginning of the year. Alain Poirier said
Monday [6 Jun 2011] that vaccinations are the safest and best way to
combat the highly contagious virus.

There have been 208 cases of measles reported in Quebec since 1 May
2011 and a total of 254 since the beginning of the year. The outbreaks
have occurred in several regions of the province. Cases in April
indicated the outbreak of the virus was sparked by people who had
returned from vacations in France, but subsequent cases appear to be
of local origin.

Measles can be contracted through contact with droplets from the
nose, mouth and throat of an infected person who puts them into the
air by coughing or sneezing. "Other than the outbreak we have seen
now, we usually see one or 2 cases of measles every year," Poirier
said in a statement. "Episodic cases of this contagious illness,
however, justify continued vaccination efforts from the point of view
of prevention and we invite people to use this method to protect
themselves."

Symptoms include fever, cough, rash, runny nose and white spots on
the inner lining of the mouth, the Public Health Agency of Canada says
on its website. People with the illness usually recover after about 10
days, but there is also a risk of complications such as pneumonia and
diarrhea. Measles can usually be prevented with up-to-date
vaccinations. 2 doses of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine are recommended
for children -- one around the time of the 1st birthday, and a 2nd
dose after age 15 months and before the child starts school.

As of last week, the federal agency said there aren't any measles
outbreaks in other parts of Canada besides Quebec. It says a total of
327 confirmed cases of measles were reported in Canada between 2002
and 2010. The average was 11 cases annually except in 2007 when there
were 102 cases, mainly due to an earlier outbreak in Quebec, in 2008
when 62 cases were registered, mainly in Ontario, and in 2010 when
there were 99 cases, mostly in British Columbia.

The United States is currently experiencing more cases than usual.
The Americas were declared "measles-free" in 2002 and Quebec usually
sees only a couple of cases a year. The province saw its last measles
outbreak 4 years ago when close to a hundred people contracted the
virus. The last major outbreak was in 1989 when 10 000 people
contracted the virus in Quebec.

The [US] Centers for Disease Control says from 1 Jan to 20 May 2011,
a total of 118 cases were reported from 23 states and New York City,
the highest reported number from the same period since 1996.

Case of Measles Confirmed in Humboldt County
--------------------------------------------
A 22-year-old Humboldt County woman who had traveled to China has
tested positive for measles. This is the County's 1st documented case
in more than a decade.

Officials are concerned the public may be at risk because the
infected woman works at hometown buffet in the Bayshore mall. On
Monday, 23 May 211 after 5pm and on Tuesday, 24 May 2011 between
10:45am and 2:00pm the woman worked at the restaurant. Anyone who
visited Hometown Buffet during those times is being asked to watch
carefully for symptoms of measles until 14 Jun 2011.

The woman was also at the China Buffet on 4th street in Eureka
between the hours of 1:00pm and 4:00pm on 20 May 2011. If you visited
that restaurant during this time period, Health officials are advising
you to watch for symptoms until 10 June 2011.

Initial symptoms of measles are similar to those of influenza and the
common cold. They include fever, cough, runny nose and red and watery
eyes. The rash associated with measles does not develop until days
later. If you develop these symptoms Health and Human services says to
stay home and contact a doctor over the phone so as to avoid exposure
to others. Officials are also urging all residents who have not been
immunized against measles to do so. Public Health has confirmed that
there is a sufficient supply of measles vaccine to meet an anticipated
spike in demand. For more information call your medical provider or
the Public Health Branch.

Attendee of High School Commencement Diagnosed with Measles
-----------------------------------------------------------
An attendee of Catonsville High School's commencement held last
Wednesday [1 Jun 2011] at UMBC has been diagnosed with measles,
according to a letter today from the principal of the high school.
According to Principal Deborah Bittner, the person was diagnosed after
the event and the state and county health departments have been
notified. Those who came in direct contact with the infected person
have been notified, but because the virus is highly contagious, the
entire community was notified. Children are vaccinated for measles
typically before they enter kindergarten, but people who were present
for the graduation ceremony should be on the alert for symptoms of
measles.

The symptoms could begin as early as today and as late as Wed 22 Jun
2011. According to the Maryland Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene, the virus is easily transmitted and can be found in the air
after an individual infected with measles coughs or sneezes. The virus
can also be spread by direct contact with infected nasal or throat
secretions. Measles can remain contagious on surfaces for up to 2
hours; however, a person can spread measles from 4 days before to 4
days after the rash develops. Anyone with measles should not visit
childcare, school, work or other public places until they are no
longer contagious.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during
the 1st 19 weeks of 2011, 118 cases of measles were reported, the
highest number reported for this period since 1996. People who were
not vaccinated accounted for 105, or 89 percent, of the 118 cases.

Minnesota officials say state's worst measles outbreak in years is
over
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Minnesota officials say the state's worst measles outbreak in years
is over. It's been 6 weeks since the state recorded its last measles
case, which brought the total to 23 cases including 14 children who
had to be hospitalized. There were no deaths.

State Epidemiologist Ruth Lynfield said Wednesday [8 Jun 2011] that
the Minnesota Department of Health decided to wait 6 weeks -- double
the usual incubation period -- before declaring victory, just to be
certain. "We all have 9 Jun 2011 (marked) on our calendar to sort of
exhale," said Patsy Stinchfield, director of infectious diseases at
Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota.

Several cases involved unvaccinated children in the Somali community,
where many families fear there's a link between the vaccine and
autism, though health officials say there's no scientific proof of a
connection. Turnout at vaccine clinics aimed at the Somali community
was sparse.

While measles has been largely eradicated in the United States, it
remains common in other parts of the world so unvaccinated travelers
can inadvertently bring it back home. The Minnesota outbreak started
when a 2-year-old of Somali descent became ill in February, about 2
weeks after returning from a trip to Kenya. 20 other cases were traced
back to that child, and the 2 unrelated cases also involved overseas
exposure, Lynfield said.

"We have to be vigilant about new cases of measles because there is a
lot of measles circulating elsewhere," Lynfield said. There's been a
spike in measles cases this year in countries often visited by U.S.
travelers -- France alone saw about 10 000 measles cases during the
1st 4 months of 2011 -- and that's led to a surge in U.S. cases.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 118 cases
had been reported across the U.S. this year as of 20 May 2011.

While much of the concern in the Minnesota outbreak focused on the
Somali community, Lynfield said the illnesses were not limited to any
one group. 7 cases were in children too young to be vaccinated.
Children typically get the 1st dose between 12 and 15 months. "There
are other communities that have low vaccination rates, so really the
message is that it's very important to be vaccinated," Lynfield said.
All but 2 of the 23 cases involved Hennepin County residents. Between
2001 and 2010, Minnesota saw a cumulative total of just 10 cases
statewide.

For Stinchfield, this outbreak brought back memories of 1990, when 3
Minnesota children died and hundreds more were sickened. She said this
outbreak wasn't nearly as bad because 93 percent of Minnesota's
children are vaccinated, a higher rate than 20 years ago. But she said
resistance to vaccination seems to be growing, threatening that
protection. "This particular outbreak is sort of officially over, but
I have a big asterisk on that," she said. "Unless we keep our
immunization rates high, we will see this again."

Measles outbreak in New York City
---------------------------------
A measles outbreak in New York City seems to be spreading. The health
department released an alert to doctors in the city today, telling
them to be on the lookout for measles.

Officials said 3 more people have contracted measles New York, adding
to the latest outbreak that has sickened a total of 13 people since
January [2011]. 2 of the new cases are adults and one is an
8-month-old child. None of them had recently traveled abroad, which
officials say means the virus is now spreading here from person to
person.

Dr. Nat Litman, who is Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at the
Children's Hospital of Montefiore said: "This is a big deal because
you're increasing numbers of children who are not being immunized and
they are at great risk of acquiring measles and the consequences,"
said Dr. Litman." Measles is a serious and very contagious illness
caused by a virus. It spreads like the cold and flu through thru
coughing, sneezing and close contact. "The consequences of measles can
be very severe ranging from ear infection to brain inflammation and
death."

According to a new report by the Centers for Disease Control, measles
has been on the rise across the country since 1996. Health officials
recommend that everyone over the age of one be fully vaccinated to
prevent the illness.

All 13 people in New York city are expected to recover.

Measles outbreak in Cache county spreads
----------------------------------------
The Bear River Health Department is working to contain a measles
outbreak in Cache County that has spread to 4 people. "We have 3 new
cases of measles confirmed [Monday 6th] in Cache County. That brings
our total to 4 cases," said Department spokeswoman Jill Parker. One
adult and 3 children between the ages of 5 and 17 have been infected
by the highly contagious virus. Parker didn't know if any of the 4 had
been vaccinated.

The 3 new cases were "close contacts" of the elementary-age child who
became the county's 1st confirmed case on 30 May 2011. That child had
traveled to Salt Lake County, where a measles outbreak recently ended.
Parker said the health department is still trying to determine if the
child was infected in the Salt Lake area.

The health department is reaching out to anyone who has come into
contact with the 4 infected individuals. With school out last week,
the largest public gatherings affected are church congregations, she
said. The 4 individuals have been asked to isolate themselves. Those
who have come in contact with the 4 who haven't received 2 doses of
the measles, mumps, rubella vaccine could be asked to quarantine
themselves as well.The vaccine is considered 99 percent effective
after 2 doses.

Vermont Sees 1st Measles Case in 10 Years
----------------------------------------------------------
The Vermont Department of Health has advised health care providers
statewide of a laboratory-confirmed case of measles, identified in an
unvaccinated individual from Southeastern Vermont. The Health
Department investigated the limited exposures that were identified in
Vermont, and no additional cases have been identified. The last
measles case reported in Vermont was 10 years ago.

"Every child in Vermont who is eligible should be vaccinated against
measles to avoid illness and the very serious consequences that may
occur with measles," said Health Commissioner Harry Chen, MD. Measles
is a vaccine-preventable disease that, while uncommon in the United
States, resurged in some areas of the nation and across Europe this
year. In the U.S., cases have been reported in Minnesota, Utah,
Massachusetts, New York and Rhode Island. There have been 118 cases of
measles reported in the U.S. through 20 May 2011, and 40 percent were
hospitalized. Many measles cases reported in the United States are due
to exposures from other countries.

France is currently experiencing a large measles outbreak. Of the 10
000 cases reported in France during the 1st 4 months of 2011, there
were 12 cases of encephalitis, a complication that often results in
permanent brain damage, 360 cases of severe measles pneumonia, and 6
measles-related deaths.

Measles is highly contagious and causes fever, cough and a rash. The
virus that causes measles can be spread from person to person through
the air. Anyone with measles can spread the disease starting 4 days
before the rash begins until 4 days after it appears.

Children in Vermont are required to have 2 doses of measles vaccine
before enrolling in Kindergarten through 12th grade. Children 15
months and older who attend licensed childcare or preschool in Vermont
are required to have one dose of the measles vaccine. Students
attending Vermont post-secondary schools are required to have 2 doses
of measles vaccine or laboratory results proving they are immune.

Vermont is one of 16 states where parents who claim a philosophical
exemption may enroll children in child care or school without being
immunized. Although measles vaccination rates for young children in
Vermont are reported to be 92 percent, that may not be high enough to
prevent measles from spreading. Measles is highly contagious and
vaccination rates of 95 percent or higher are often needed to provide
herd or community immunity, which limits the spread of the disease
within a community.

Measles outbreak hits city -- 80 children in quarantine
-------------------------------------------------------
Around 80 children have been quarantined in their homes following a
measles outbreak in Auckland. 8 cases of the disease have been
confirmed after it was discovered an 8-year-old carrier had last week
attended a screening of Pirates of the Caribbean at St Lukes Cinema.
Subsequent checks by health officials found 7 more people, including 6
from the boy's school and one from his home, all unimmunised, are
infected. In Hawke's Bay, 18 cases of measles have also been confirmed
since March and one person was hospitalised.

Auckland Regional Public Health Service medical officer of health Dr
Richard Hoskins said they had been tracing all close contacts of the
boy including relatives, friends and those who were at the A and E
clinic when he arrived, as well as working with the school to
quarantine those who are not immune. The people identified as being at
risk were still in quarantine and some were expected to develop
measles, which causes ear infections and pneumonia, and can lead to
other serious complications.

Dr Hoskins said the school that the boy attends has a low
immunisation rate. Around 80 pupils of the school's approximate
population of 500 have been quarantined until 15 Jun 2011 -- once
their risk of developing the disease is over. If any further cases
develop, the quarantine period might be extended, he said.

No cases from exposure at the cinema have been notified yet though
they may not become sick until Saturday. Dr Hoskins said parents
should check their children's immunisations are up to date and take
action if required. Prompt identification can help limit the spread of
measles to others.

Anyone who developed common symptoms such as a red rash, runny nose,
cough, sore eyes or fever, should contact their local doctor or call
Healthline before visiting a medical professional, to minimise the
spread of infection.

Measles Outbreak In Hawke's Bay
-------------------------------
A total of 18 cases of measles in Hawke's Bay, since March [2011],
has prompted health officials to urge parents to check their children
are fully immunised. Hawke's Bay DHB Medical Officer of Health Lester
Calder said of the 18 cases of measles 14 cases were from Flaxmere/
Hastings, 3 from Maraekakaho and one from Napier.

Dr Calder said measles doesn't just affect children. 3 of the most
recent cases in Hawke's Bay affected adults, one of whom was
hospitalised. "Measles is highly infectious and makes people very
sick. Vaccination is the only protection against this potentially
serious disease. The disease spreads easily through the air,
especially from coughing and sneezing -- it is highly infectious. It
commonly causes ear infections and pneumonia, and may lead to other
serious complications and can, in some cases, be fatal. Measles is
still circulating in our communities so it's important children are
immunised to protect them from needless suffering," he said.

While Hawke's Bay had very good rates of immunisation amongst pre
school children, older children and adults may not be up-to-date with
the measles vaccine. Dr Calder advised adults who were born after 1969
to check with their GP as they may also not be immune. Anyone over the
age of one year, who was born after 1969 and who has not had 2 doses
of measles vaccine in the past is eligible for free measles
immunisation.

Those not immune to measles and are exposed to measles may be
excluded from work, school and child-care for up to 2 weeks.
