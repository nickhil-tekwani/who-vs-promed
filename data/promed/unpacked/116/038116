Update - Evolution of bovine nodular dermatosis [Lumpy skin disease, LSD] outbreaks [in the Balkans] as of 21 Jun 2016
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of 21 Jun 2016, the updated number of LSD outbreaks in the Balkan countries since the start of the year is as follows:
Greece: 56 outbreaks;
Bulgaria: 173 outbreaks;
Serbia: 17 outbreaks;
Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia: 35 outbreaks

It deserves to be reminded that, concerning Bulgaria, the European Commission adopted a decision imposing restrictions for this country on the movement of bovine animals and products derived from them (2016/645/EC) and another decision approving the plan for emergency LSD vaccination, which entered into force by notifying them. Due to the vaccination, the restrictions apply to the entire territory of Bulgaria, completing the 2016 Decision restrictions/645/EC.

All these measures are implemented to prevent the spread of disease both in other areas of Bulgaria which are unaffected by the disease, as well as in other Member States where the disease has not been diagnosed.

ANSVSA continues contingency and emergency activities, including instruction and training of the country's veterinary services for the required intervention in the event of outbreaks of the disease, as well as supplying information to the cattle breeders about the evolution of the disease and the needed measures which must be respected.

[Romania's concerns about LSD risk are underlined by its position as a cattle exporting country, in particular for slaughter. The cattle population of Romania (2013 figures, OIE) are nearly 2.6 million.

Earlier information on the LSD-preventive measures planned/undertaken by Romania is included in 20160426.4184847. It will be interesting to note if Romania considers the establishment of a cordon sanitaire of vaccinated animals along its southern and southwestern borders with (LSD-infected) Bulgaria and Serbia. - Mod.AS
