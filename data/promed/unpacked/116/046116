A farmer in Saint George de Reintembault, La Mayenne who is a raiser
of the beef-breed Bleu Belge (a well-built, large bovine with
silver-grey fur), sold one of his pedigree stock to a farmer in Izier,
just southeast of Dijon in the Cote d'Or. The animal had a reaction to
a bovine tuberculosis test and was confirmed positive. The farmer at
Saint George (about 25 km from me) has had his herd tested and
confirmed infected with bovine TB. The whole herd of some 300 pedigree
animals has been slaughtered, including even the farm dog.

This report has been confirmed by Dr Claude Gras, Cattle Vet at the
Cabinet Veteriniares, Rue de la Liberation, Saint James, 50240,
Normandy, France.

No one knows how this herd became infected. There is a lot of forest
around here, and we have boar, roe deer, foxes and the odd badger.

[Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a notifiable, contagious disease in the
European Union (EU). Several member states, including France, have
attained, officially, tuberculosis-free (OTF) status (over 99.9
percent of herds found free from bTB).

Saint-Georges-de-Reintembault is a commune in the Ille-et-Vilaine
department in Bretagne in northwestern France. The slaughter of all
bovines on the affected farm seems to be in line with France's bTB
control policy. It will be interesting to note whether the organs of
the culled animals have been examined, how many of them may have been
found affected, and how old were the lesions. The final results of the
epidemiological investigation into the origin of infection is
anticipated with interest; it may include the examinations of other
species on the affected premises, such as the mentioned dog, as well
as in the surroundings.

It addition, information on previous outbreaks in domestic cattle and
cases in wildlife (specifying their species) recorded in this
department since the official declaration of France as OTF in 2000,
will be helpful. At that time (2000), there was no indication of a
wildlife reservoir.

In recent years, bTB has been recorded in several parts of France in
wildlife; this included red deer (_Cervus elaphus_), wild boar (_Sus
scrofa_), roe deer (_Capreolus capreolus_ and [the occasional] red fox
(_Vulpes vulpes_). There has also been some recurrence of bTB on
cattle farms. - Mod.AS]
