The new case of [a] hantavirus [infection] was confirmed in Valdivia,
which brings to 5 the number of people infected with the disease
[virus], all from the Corral community. This [latest] case is a 34
year old man, whose wife is a port community hospital staff member who
was also positive [for a hantavirus infection], and who was admitted
the Valdivia Regional Hospital recently [see ProMED-mail archive
number 20110405.1060].

This information was confirmed by the Health SEREMI [Regional
Ministerial Secretariat staff member] Richard Rios, who stated that
before the presence of the virus was confirmed, the patient was
treated as such [as if positive] preventively, given the relationship
with the confirmed case [his wife]. The man remains in the intensive
care unit of the previously mentioned health facility. His condition
is guarded and he is breathing on his own [without a mechanical
respirator].

Meanwhile, in relation to the brief closure of the Los Pellines rural
medical station in the Niebla locality due to the presence of rodents
in the facility, the regional ministerial secretary stated that work
is underway to improve the situation and it is the assistance network
of the Health Services that will define the time [period] of the
station's closure.

[The case above, now confirmed as a hantavirus infection, may
represent person-to-person transmission that occasionally occurs with
Andes virus infected individuals in very close contact with others,
often spouses. Given the active transmission of Andes hantavirus in
the region (the most likely hantavirus involved in these cases), the
closure of the health station is prudent until rodent control is
accomplished.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can
