Though ongoing H7N9 influenza activity in China -- with 8 new cases reported today [28 Jan 2014] -- is mainly a zoonotic event, its parallel rise with seasonal influenza poses a virus reassortment threat, according to a new assessment today from European health officials. Activities surrounding Chinese New Year on 31 Jan 2014 will put humans in the crosshairs of both H7N9 and seasonal flu strains, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in a comprehensive look at China's 2nd wave of disease activity and its 1st update since May 2013.

The ECDC [European Centre for Disease Control] said the outbreak in China remains localized, with the virus mainly transmitted sporadically to humans who have close contact with the animal reservoir, presumably live poultry. Though the H7N9 virus doesn't appear to have the capacity for efficient human-to-human spread, new reassortants with seasonal flu strains could arm it with the ability to transmit more easily, a situation that bears close monitoring, the organization added.

Seasonal flu activity is at high levels and still increasing in China, with all 3 strains [(H1N1)pdm09, H3N2, and B] circulating, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [27 Jan 2014] in its global flu update [see ProMED-mail post Influenza (08): WHO global update 20140127.2235963]. In southern China the dominant strains are H3N2 and the (H1N1)pdm09 viruses, while the northern part is seeing mainly (H1N1)pdm09 virus.

Brisk seasonal flu activity is occurring alongside rapidly accumulating H7N9 cases in the eastern and southern provinces. Last spring [2013] China's surveillance system picked up at least one coinfection case, that of a 15-year-old boy who recovered after he was sick with both H7N9 and H3N2. "Hundreds of millions of Chinese are returning to their villages over the festive season in what is believed to be the world's largest annual human migration," ECDC said in its risk assessment. Considering the spread of H5N1 avian influenza across geographic borders, it's surprising that neighboring Asian countries haven't detected more H7N9 cases, the agency said, urging countries to be on guard for imported cases.

It echoed a joint WHO-China inspection team's conclusion last spring [2013] that a cross-sector effort will be needed to reduce H7N9's threat. ECDC noted that there may be a role for a poultry H7N9 vaccine in affected parts of China, and it warned that the virus could threaten the country's food supply if it becomes highly pathogenic.

The ECDC's report reviewed the latest clinical findings, lab tools for detections, and vaccine developments. It said 6 clinical trials using different variants of H7N9 candidate vaccine strains have been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov and that initial results have been reported for 2 of them: a virus-like particle vaccine from Novavax and a cell-culture adjuvanted vaccine from Novartis. 2 phase 1 studies are enrolling participants, one supported by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and one by GlaxoSmithKline, the ECDC said. Other studies, done with NIAID support, will test "mix-and-match" approaches that pair unadjuvanted candidate vaccines with other companies' adjuvants.

Few details are known about China's H7N9 vaccine development plans, but a report today [28 Jan 2014] from Xinhua, China's state news service, said one developed by Hualan Biological Engineering, Inc, has passed initial evaluation by regulators in Henan province, but it's not clear when China's Food and Drug Administration will clear it for production.

[In the latest outbreak developments, 8 new cases today (28 Jan 2014) pushed the outbreak total to 260, according to a case list compiled by FluTrackers. The cases also edged the number of cases in the outbreak's 2nd wave to 124, putting it within close range of the 136 cases recorded after the virus first emerged last spring [2013].

Health officials in Hong Kong today (28 Jan 2014) said no illnesses have been detected in people who had contact with the infected chickens imported from Guangdong province. H7N9 test findings in the birds yesterday triggered the 3-week closure of Hong Kong's wholesale poultry market and the culling of 20 000 birds to curb the spread of the virus. The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said in a statement that the driver who brought the imported birds to Hong Kong is under hospital observation, is asymptomatic, and has still tested negative for the virus. It added that 95 other contacts, including 49 people who helped cull the birds, are also being monitored. One market inspection officer had nonspecific symptoms but tested negative for the virus. - Mod.CP]
