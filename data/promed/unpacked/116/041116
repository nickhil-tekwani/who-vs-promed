The Southwest Utah Health Department is investigating an _E. coli_ outbreak in Hildale, and family members confirm at least 2 young children have died. The parents of a 6-year-old from Hildale tell Fox 13 News their daughter died of kidney failure as a result of _E. coli_, and they say a young boy who is close friends with the girl and who lives in their housing complex is also deceased.

The Southwest Utah Public Health Department states they are investigating an outbreak of _E. coli_ in the Hildale, Utah area. The department states the outbreak appears to be confined to a limited area with, "little or no risk to the larger community."

David Heaton, a spokesman for the health department, tells Fox 13 News they have tested the water in the area and are confident the water is not the source of the contamination. "We're pretty sure it's not from the water," Heaton said. "The tests that we've done there have been clean every time. We're looking at either exposure to an infected animal or to contaminated food, like food poisoning."

The family said a couple who lives in their complex have been discarding diapers in the yard, and some dogs have been getting into those diapers. Recently the young girl and her mother began cleaning up that debris and came in contact with the dogs, and it was after that contact she became sick. The family says the girl and her mother both got sick, as did a young boy around the same age as the girl who also lives in the housing complex. The family says the girl died several days after getting sick, as did her young friend. The mother was sickened but recovered.

According to health officials, _E.coli_ are bacteria found in the environment, foods and intestines of people and animals. While the bacterium is usually harmless, some strains can cause diarrhea, urinary tract infections, respiratory illness, bloodstream infections and other illnesses. Children under 5 and older adults are more likely to develop serious illness, but anyone can be affected. The disease-causing bacteria typically spread when particles of human or animal feces are exposed to the mouth. The particles usually come from unwashed hands, contaminated water or unpasteurized foods or livestock. Symptoms vary but often include stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting and fever usually less than 101 deg F [approx. 38 deg C]. Most people get better within 5-7 days. Infections range from mild to serious.

A health care provider should be contacted if diarrhea lasts more than 3 days or is accompanied by high fever, blood in the stool, low urine amounts or vomiting to the point that liquid can't be kept down.

[The posting does not specifically state that the _E. coli_ was an enterohemorrhagic (Shiga toxin producing) strain of which the prototypic strain in _E. coli_ O157:H7. Certainly bacteremia caused by _E. coli_ with either a gastrointestinal or genitourinary source can cause severe illness, kidney failure and death, 2 fatal illnesses related epidemiologically strongly suggest an EHEC cause.

ProMED would like more information regarding this potential cluster of cases which may be due to EHEC.

The case fatality rate for EHEC is usually below 10 percent. There is significant evidence that the administration of most antimicrobial agents early in EHEC disease may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Most fatalities are in individuals who develop central nervous system complications in HUS.

Since CS Wong and colleagues reported a relative risk of the development of HUS in _E. coli_ O157 infection of 17.3 (95 percent confidence interval 2.2 to 137) (1), it has generally been thought that antimicrobial agents increase HUS risk. In this study, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and beta-lactam drugs were those most linked to HUS. Whether other antimicrobial agents would likewise be linked to HUS, whether the same effect would occur in adults, whether non-O157 strains would behave similarly and what the mechanism of the effect is are not clearly known. Overall, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (also referred to as cotrimoxazole) and fluoroquinolones seemed to be the prime offenders, both not uncommonly used empirically for perceived bacterial enteritis.

As discussed in Kimmitt's paper in Emerging Infectious Diseases, the Shiga toxin genes reside on a lambda-like bacteriophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome (2). Different EHEC strains contain various numbers of these phages displaying much diversity and some beginning defective (3). In particular, fluoroquinolones induce high-level expression of previously silent bacteriophage genes with coexpression of the toxin genes.

A number of studies have addressed Shiga toxin production and/or release using a variety of antimicrobial agents at subinhibitory and/or suprainhibitory concentrations using a variety of markers for toxin. These include direct immunologic measurement, cytotoxicity assays, and enzyme reporters. It appears that imipenem (4) and rifaximin (5) do not induce toxin production or phage-mediated cell lysis, suggesting that these agents may not increase the risk of HUS and might be useful in management. TJ Ochoa and colleagues found that fluoroquinolones induced Shiga toxin induction much more commonly in O157 than non-O157 strains (5), but Lee and Stein did not (6).
