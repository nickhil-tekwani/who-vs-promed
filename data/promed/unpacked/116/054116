Unusual fruit and leaf symptoms were observed in tomatoes in North Rhine-Westphalia. In total, more than 25 ha [about 62 acres] of greenhouse tomatoes were affected. _Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) has been confirmed in 7 greenhouses; one further greenhouse is suspected to be infested. It's the 1st report of ToBRFV in Germany. The infested tomato plants were used for tomato fruit production. Eradication measures are in progress.

ToBRFV infects tomato plants and leads to foliar symptoms, including chlorosis mosaic with dark green bulges and narrowing. Fruit symptoms consisted of yellow spots, often concentrated around the calyx with occasional rugose symptoms rendering the fruits non-marketable. The virus can affect up to 100% of a crop.

The available resistance genes in conventional tomato varieties against other tobamoviruses are ineffective against ToBRFV. So far, too little is known about the virus to exclude possible damage on other host plants. The virus can establish in greenhouses [and] outdoors; potential host plants can serve as reservoir for new infections. Because of its high damaging potential for tomato production, ToBRFV poses a significant phytosanitary risk for Germany and other EU member states.

[_Tomato brown rugose fruit virus_ (ToBRFV) was identified as a new member of genus _Tobamovirus_ (type species _Tobacco mosaic virus_, TMV) in Jordan after a new disease of glasshouse tomatoes occurred there in 2015. Since then, it has been identified in Israel and Mexico (see links below) and has also been reported by national authorities from Italy (Sicily).

Tobamoviruses may be seed transmitted and can also be spread by mechanical means (human and insect activities), as well as with contaminated equipment, or plant or other materials. Volunteer crop plants and solanaceous weed species can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management relies mainly on exclusion but may include phytosanitation (disinfecting tools, removing crop debris) and control of weed reservoirs. Several tobamoviruses are known to affect tomato, including _Tomato mosaic virus_ and TMV. Use of certified clean seeds or tomato transplants is crucial.

Among the seed-borne viruses, tobamoviruses are currently considered a risk for crop production worldwide due to increasing global seed trade. For some species, seed coat surface sterilisation is effective in preventing transmission to new seedlings, suggesting that these viruses are carried on the outside of seeds. However, for some species such as _Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_, surface sterilisation of seeds does not seem to prevent transmission, suggesting these viruses may be carried within the endosperm since seed-transmitted tobamoviruses are thought to be absent from embryos. Tomato seeds are traded widely and are known to pose a risk for spreading viruses and other pathogens internationally (such as, ProMED-mail post 20140122.2222560), thus work to assess a potential quarantine risk posed by the new ToBRFV is needed.
