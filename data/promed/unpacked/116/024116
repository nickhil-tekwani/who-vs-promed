The outbreak of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) has killed 3 people in the North Gondar Tselemt area in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. The 3 people who were getting medical treatment after acquiring AWD have passed away, according to the state broadcaster ETV. The report indicated that currently 151 people affected by AWD are also identified in 3 locations of Amhara region. Currently in North Gondar, Tselemt area, 90 people infected with AWD have been identified and are being treated. While in Abergele area, 58 people and 4 in Beyeda area are getting treatment after acquiring AWD.

The ETV report indicated that the 152 suspected of acquiring AWD are being treated separately in the 3 localities. It is indicated that a medical team at the national, regional, and zone level is mobilized to contain the outbreak in the areas. In addition, teams from WHO and Doctors Without Borders are also engaged to combat AWD in the areas, according to ETV.

Ethiopia has the poorest sanitation facilities in Africa and has been frequently hit by AWD. In Ethiopia, AWD outbreaks have been reported in different parts at different times. The outbreak in Moyale area in the southern part of the country in 2016 resulted in a total of 268 cases and 2 deaths reported. In 2017, it was also reported that some parts of the Somali region of Ethiopia were also affected by an AWD outbreak resulting in the deaths of many people.

[2] Cholera - Kenya

Researchers have said there is no outbreak of drug-resistant cholera in Kenya. Kenya Medical Research Institute (Kemri) said the country has drugs to treat even the most stubborn of cholera strains reported locally.

"While it is true that a number of disease-causing bacterial pathogens are increasingly becoming resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics, there still exists a number of drugs that are effective in the market," Kemri's director of the Centre for Microbiology Research Dr. Willy Sang said. He said drugs are not the 1st line of management to a cholera case, but the restoration of fluids or oral rehydration salts are the most effective methods.

He was responding to social media claims of an outbreak of a drug-resistant cholera strain. "The public should therefore not panic about the reported 'new strain' of cholera, but should instead exercise higher standards of personal hygiene including hand washing, drinking only boiled or treated water, and eating properly cooked foods among other known preventive measures," Sang said.

At least 1866 cases of cholera have been reported in Kenya in 2019, 91 of which were confirmed, according to the Ministry of Health.

Health CS Sicily Kariuki recently said since January 2019, cholera outbreaks have been reported in Narok, Kajiado, Nairobi, Garissa, Machakos and Mandera counties. The outbreak has, however, been successfully contained in Narok, she told the National Assembly Health committee last week. "A few isolated new cases are being reported in the remaining 5 counties. However, there have been no reported cholera cases in Murang'a," Kariuki said.

She said cholera is a highly infectious disease, which compelled the ministry to put in place several measures to contain the situation. It has supplied hospital beds, water treatment chemicals, oral rehydration salts, antibiotics, IV fluids, water quality test-kits, personal and spray pumps to the affected counties. "The counties with an active transmission have set up cholera treatment centres to support timely treatment and minimize further spread," Kariuki said.

Nairobi, for instance, has set up centres at Riruta Health Centre, Mbagathi, Kenyatta and Mama Lucy hospitals. At least 4 people died and dozens more were treated when another outbreak hit the city in 2017, causing authorities to shut down some restaurants.

The ministry, in collaboration with county health departments, is conducting contact tracing in households and workplaces, continuous line listing of cases and screening using rapid diagnostic test kits to curtail the outbreak.

[3] Cholera - Zambia (Mpulungu)
Date: Tue 14 May 2019

Government has revealed that about 17 people are admitted to Mpulungu urban clinic for suspected cholera. Mpulungu District Commissioner Dennis Sikazwe has confirmed the development to ZANIS [Zambia News and Information Services] in Mpulungu today [14 May 2019].

Mr. Sikazwe said the Ministry of Health has since recommended that schools be closed for the period of one week to ensure that the situation is contained. He added that all operations of ferrying people from Mpulungu to Nsumbu in Nsama district by boats has been suspended for the period of one week. Mr. Sikazwe has also revealed that the ministry has put up measures to sensitize people on the need to maintain high levels of hygiene during this period.

The District Commissioner has also urged people to work with the medical staff at the health facility in order to control a further spread of the disease. He has also urged people to report all suspected cholera cases to the nearest health centres.

In Mbala, 5 people have been admitted at Tulemane clinic for suspected cholera. Sources from Tulemane clinic, who sought anonymity, confirmed the development to ZANIS in Mbala yesterday [13 May 2019]. Mbala District Commissioner Kedrick Sikombe, who could not confirm the matter, has promised to give a detailed report once he gets details from the Ministry of Health in the area.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated by Lutwick and colleagues (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P. Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J, editors. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2018:113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 L [4.2 qt] in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
