An outbreak of cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) has been reported in 4 districts in the Northern Region [of Ghana], leaving one person dead. An 18-year-old student of Yendi Senior High School has died of the disease.

So far 30 cases have been reported. Out of that number, 23 were reported from Yendi, 2 from the Mion District, one from the Zabzugu District, and 2 from the Saboba District. [This adds up to 28. Perhaps there were 2 from other districts? - Mod.LM] The Yendi Municipal Disease Control Officer, Awuni Mbabila, made this known when he briefed the Yendi Municipal Epidemic Management Committee at a meeting in Yendi last Friday.

He said those with severe head and neck pains should report to a health facility. Mr Mbabila said an analysis of cases had been done by person, place, and time to present a clear picture of the situation. He said the Hospital Epidemic Management Team had moved to the affected areas in the municipality to assess the situation and also educate residents on the disease. According to him, health workers at the sub-districts were also carrying out intensive public sensitisation on the disease to avoid an outbreak.

The Yendi Municipal Chief Executive, Issah Zakaria, said CSM was becoming alarming in the municipality and it was for that reason that the emergency meeting was called to discuss how the outbreak could be contained. The meeting was attended by representatives of the Ghana Armed Forces, the Ghana Police Service, the Ghana Red Cross, the Veterinary Service, the Environmental Health Unit, the Information Services Department, as well as religious leaders and assembly members,

The meeting appealed to the health authorities to supply CSM vaccines to the Yendi Hospital to enable it to carry out massive vaccination to avoid an outbreak.

[The Northern Region, the largest in area of Ghana's 10 regions, is divided into 26 districts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Ghana#Northern_Region). For a map of Ghana that shows the Northern Region, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Ghana. Yendi, Zabzugu, and Saboba are adjacent districts and their locations can be found on a map of the Northern Region at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8c/Northern_Ghana_districts.png. Mion is a new district that was carved from Yendi in 2012 (http://www.ghanadistricts.com/districts/?news&r=6&_=216).

Ghana is one of the 21 countries in the African meningitis belt, a region in sub-Saharan Africa where the rate of incidence of meningitis is very high. The other countries in the African meningitis belt are Gambia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Mali, Cote d'Ivoire, Benin, Togo, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Central African Republic, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Eritrea (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/pdf/yellowbook-2012-map3-13-frequent-epidemics-meningococcal-meningitis.pdf). Outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the African meningitis belt each year during the hot, dry season, between December and June (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A has been the most commonly isolated pathogen in the African meningitis belt.

However, since the introduction of the meningococcal A conjugate vaccine in countries of the African meningitis belt in 2010, the WHO noted a decrease in the number of cases of meningitis; in fact, the number of cases in 2013 was the lowest recorded during the epidemic season in the last 10 years (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2013_06_06_menin/en/). In addition, _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A was noted to be no longer the predominant pathogen.

According to the WHO Meningitis Weekly Bulletin for the 1st 9 months of 2013 in the African meningitis belt (Table 3, http://www.meningvax.org/files/BulletinMeningite2013_S36_39September.pdf), of the bacterial pathogens identified, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was the most frequent (404 cases), followed by _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135 (229 cases). _N. meningitidis_ serogroup A was identified in only 22 cases.

In Ghana in particular, a bacterial pathogen was identified in 59 of 303 CSF specimens (19.5 percent); _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ was the most frequent bacterial pathogen (26 cases) identified; _N. meningitidis_ serogroup W135 was found in 14 cases, serogroup B in 2 cases, serogroup A in no cases; other meningococcal serogroups in 15 cases, and other pathogens in 2 cases.

We are not told the microbial etiology of the meningitis outbreak in the various districts of Ghana in the report above. Because meningococcal vaccines will only protect against meningitis due to the meningococcal polysaccharide serogroups that the vaccine contains, laboratory confirmation of the serogroup causing an outbreak is important so that the appropriate vaccine is used. ProMED-mail would appreciate information on the microbial causes of the meningitis outbreaks in Ghana from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
