Communicable disease experts will begin their investigation into [an
outbreak of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant strains of
_Acinetobacter baumannii_ at Christchurch Hospital this week.
So-called hospital super-bugs regained national attention over the weekend
after Canterbury Health admitted it had been unable to eradicate the
potentially deadly bacterium _Acinetobacter baumannii_.
The antibiotic-resistant [bacterium has been implicated in the deaths of
7 patients -- 2 last month and 5 in Dec 1998.
Wellington Hospital has had problems with [another antibiotic-resistant
bacterium, identifying 14 cases of the potentially deadly bacterium
methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ [MRSA in the last 2 months.
Middlemore Hospital, Auckland, has also had recent problems with
antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
The Ministry of Health's acting director of public health, Bob Boyd, said
antibiotic-resistance was a problem for all hospitals, and the 3
outbreaks in Christchurch, Wellington, and Auckland were not linked.
Canterbury Health last week sought expert help in eradicating a
particularly virulent antibiotic-resistant strain of _Acinetobacter
baumannii_.
An epidemiologist from the Institute for Environmental and Scientific
Research's (ESR) communicable diseases group will begin studying the
outbreak this week. The investigation is being funded by the Ministry of
Health.
ESR's communicable-diseases manager, Judith Miller, said the expert's role
was still being finalised, but it was likely to involve a review of data
gathered. "We will try to find out how the outbreaks have occurred and identify any
common risk factors," Ms Miller said.
The bacteria have earned their so-called super-bug status because of their
ability to resist commonly prescribed antibiotics. Experts have warned that
unless people limit their exposure to antibiotics, the resistance problem
will worsen.
Doctors throughout New Zealand began a campaign last winter to reduce
antibiotic prescribing, and the Government is now trying to reduce exposure
of livestock to antibiotics.
