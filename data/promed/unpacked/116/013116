[The Netherlands had one case in 2008 near Drenthe, one case in 2007
and one in 2005. It is therefore not at all surprising to see another
case dribble in. It is entirely predictable that sporadic cases will
occur as we come to the point where cases are occurring as part of
the unusually long tail to the BSE epidemic curve that began in
England in 1986.

The 1st case in the Netherlands was 1997. However, recent reductions
in the number of cases in Europe are actually quite dramatic as we
enter the epidemic's tail distribution. For example, in 2005 the UK
had 225 and in 2009 they had only 12 reported cases to OIE WAHID
database. Similarly, Spain had 98 cases in 2005 and 18 in 2009.
Another example is France which had 31 cases of BSE in 2005 and 10 in
2009.

The gradual decline in BSE occurrence is to be expected in the region
as the older bovine population dies off. Only animals born before the
relevant feed ban in 2001 will become identified as new cases due to
the fact that the disease is transmitted through contaminated cattle
feed that was consumed before the total feed ban in 2001. - Mod.PC]
