[This is the 1st official report on RVF in Swaziland. The disease was
reported from neighboring Mpumalanga, in South Africa, earlier this
year (2008). South Africa and Mozambique, Swaziland's neighbors, are
known to be long infected: S. Africa since 1950, Mozambique since
1969. It will be of importance to note if human cases have been
recorded in Swaziland.

Has the vaccination been undertaken in view of the RVF outbreak in
neighboring Mpumalanga?

Results of the investigation into the "naturalness" of the infection,
excluding possible involvement of the vaccine, are anticipated with
interest. - Mod.AS]
