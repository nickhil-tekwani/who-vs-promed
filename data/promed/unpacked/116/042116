I would like to comment on the most recent postings from Eric Fleegler
(dated 15 Jan 1999) and Jane Cardosa (dated 16 Jan 1999).
The posting from Eric Fleegler was wrongly placed under the Malaysian
headline. He was commenting on the 600 fatalities in Cambodia in a posting
by Jack Woodall on 14 Jan 1999. [This error has now been corrected. - Mod.ES
The posting from Jane Cardosa in Sarawak, Malaysia, touched on 2 issues -
laboratory confirmation of JE cases in the present outbreak in Peninsular
Malaysia and the ages of the fatal cases.
I would like to refer to the posting on 25 Nov 1998 from Clyde Markon on
the JE outbreak reported in the New Straits Times in Malaysia. In the
report, it was stated, I quote, "The illnesses were confirmed as having
been caused by Japanese encephalitis virus by the Institute for Medical
Research [the national viral diagnostic laboratory after analyzing fluid
samples taken from four victims." [This presumably is the layman's way of
saying that the four JE cases have been serologically confirmed.
The Virology Division of the Institute uses a JE MAC ELISA IgM test [1.
Using this test in a study of blood and cerebrospinal fluid from 2,388
patients with encephalitis from 1993 to 1995, they found the highest
incidence in the 5-15 age group. The state with the highest incidence was
Sarawak [1.
In another published paper [2, it was stated that a total of 172 JE cases
with 12 deaths were reported from 1989 to 1993. 31% of the cases were in
children 0-4 years; 52% in the 7-14 year age-group; 9% in the 15-24 year
age group and 8% in adults > 25 years. [Age group of fatal cases not
mentioned.
I hope the above information would help to clarify some of the issues
raised regarding the recent JE outbreak in Malaysia.

An outbreak of Japanese encephalitis [JE in Malaysia claimed its 14th
victim Monday after a pig farmer suspected to be suffering from the illness
died, a news report said. The 28-year-old man died at Ipoh Hospital after
suffering from symptoms associated with the mosquito-borne virus, state-run
Bernama news agency said. He was admitted to the hospital on Wednesday
after complaining about a prolonged fever.
Health authorities have been monitoring a rise of JE, which is believed to
be passed to humans by certain mosquitoes that have bitten infected pigs.
The disease claimed three lives in 1997, and seven last year, mostly in the
northern state of Perak and Sarawak state on Borneo island.
To keep the disease contained, state veterinary departments in the affected
states have banned the movements of pigs between farms. A few thousand
people have been given free vaccinations since the outbreak began in areas
considered high-risk.

Part of the 125,000 pigs here [Ipoh will be vaccinated against the deadly
JE to prevent a recurrence of an epidemic of the mosquito-borne disease
which had claimed nine [ten, with the 14th reported fatal case above lives
here thus far.
Veterinary Research Institute Director Dr Abdul Aziz Jamaluddin, who led
the vaccination exercise today, said under the first phase, some 5,000 pigs
in Tambun, Ampang and Ulu Piah areas would be injected with the "Tai Shu"
vaccine imported from Taiwan. Blood samples were also collected at random
for antibody tests and virus separation.
"We can see the effect of the vaccine in a month. An 80 per cent response
is enough to protect the pigs from succumbing to the disease," he told
reporters.
Dr Abdul Aziz said although the virus strain here had been just discovered,
it had some similarities with the strain imported from Taiwan. Hence, the
imported vaccine could provide the desired protection against the disease
spread by culex mosquitoes which breed in dirty water in pig farms.
Dr Abdul Aziz said 50,000 doses of the "Tai Shu" vaccine would be imported
from Taiwan after the Hari Raya holidays to be injected into pigs in 28 pig
farms hit by the disease which was first detected here in October last
year. He said pig farm owners would have to pay for the vaccine costing RM7
a jab.
Meanwhile in Seremban, the second anti-JE vaccination exercise for more
than 600 residents at Kampung Wong Seng Chow and Kampung Baru Sikamat, the
two worst-hit areas in Negeri Sembilan, kicked off on Saturday. Children
below 12 years from Bukit Pelandok in Port Dickson were also given the
jabs, State Health Committee Chairman Datuk Goh Siow Huat said today.
A total of 2,447 people from the three places were given the first dose of
the vaccination when the disease first struck the state on Jan 2.
