The transmissible colistin-resistant gene MCR-1, recently described in China, has now been detected in the Netherlands by Central Veterinary Institute, part of Wageningen UR (CVI). In an initial screening of a large collection of salmonellas (N = 3274) from the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) and the Netherlands Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) from 2014 and 2015 that mainly originated from sick people, livestock and food, 3 strains were found that contained the transmissible MCR-1 gene.

These were 2 _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B variant Java strains from chickens slaughtered in the Netherlands and one _S._ Schwarzengrund strain from imported turkey meat. Therefore this resistance mechanism also occurs in the Netherlands on an incidental basis and this is comparable to the recent data from Denmark and the United Kingdom.

Over the next few weeks, CVI will also investigate the presence of the MCR-1 gene in a collection of _Escherichia coli_ bacteria originating from faecal samples from livestock (broiler chickens, finisher pigs, veal calves and dairy cows) taken by the NVWA as part of the national resistance monitoring in animals. Data from this investigation will be used to make a risk assessment.
