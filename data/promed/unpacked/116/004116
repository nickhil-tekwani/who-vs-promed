Minnesota investigates anthrax case: no evidence of terrorism
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Minnesota Department of Health is investigating an "extremely
rare" case of inhaled anthrax, but officials said on Tuesday [9 Aug
2011] that there is no threat to the public. The patient, who was not
identified, was hospitalized in Minnesota after traveling through
Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas, where anthrax spores occur in the
environment.

The infectious agent probably came from natural sources, and there is
no evidence of a link to terrorism, according to a Health Department
statement released on Tuesday [9 Aug 2011]. Nevertheless, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation [FBI] joined in the investigation because
anthrax can be used as a bioterrorism agent.

The case most likely occurred when the individual was exposed to soil
or animal remains infected with anthrax, a bacterial spore that can
cause potentially fatal illness. "We're not giving details about the
case simply because it is not a risk to the public, and we're
concerned about patient privacy," said Dr Ruth Lynfield, the Minnesota
state epidemiologist. She noted that anthrax is not spread from person
to person. She said the patient is being treated, but declined to
specify his or her medical condition.

The patient, who is not from Minnesota, was hospitalized somewhere in
the state after developing fever and pneumonia. When the hospital
conducted routine specimen tests, the lab discovered an unusual growth
and sent it to the Health Department for further testing. Lynfield
said her office confirmed it as anthrax, and contacted the FBI as
"standard protocol".

Government officials have treated anthrax exposure as a possible act
of terrorism since the deadly spate of anthrax-tainted letters that
followed the [11 Sep 2001] terrorist attacks. That year, 22 people
developed anthrax infections and 5 died after handling or receiving
letters containing anthrax spores. In spite of intensive
investigation, no one was charged in that case.

In the latest case, though, investigators found "no evidence
suggesting it was a criminal or terrorist act", the Health Department
said, adding that the FBI is no longer actively investigating the
incident. Lynfield said such cases are "extremely rare", although in
the past anthrax was known as "wool sorter's disease" because people
would breathe in spores from infected animals. Anthrax can infect
cattle, sheep, and other animals, and can live in soil for years.
Inhaled anthrax is far more dangerous than a more common type of
anthrax infection, which infects the skin. The illness can start with
flu-like symptoms, such as cough, fever, and muscle aches, and last
several days before seeming to disappear. When it returns, it can
cause lung problems, breathing difficulty, and shock. Without
treatment, it is fatal in up to 90 per cent of cases, according to the
Health Department.

The department is continuing to investigate.

[Obviously until the Minnesota Public Health Department has completed
its interviews with this patient and any companions, any possible
details on how (s)he got exposed are unavailable. Travelling through
Montana, Wyoming, possibly South Dakota, to Minnesota may involve a
wide range of experiences. And this person was only moderately
affected when diagnosed. All in all suggesting a long incubation
period, say 10-15 days. One does not acquire this form of clinical
anthrax from being present at or participating in the slaughter and
butchering of an infected animal. Wet particles from an anthrax case
don't fly -- Rift Valley fever (RVF) is different but (s)he was not
diagnosed with RVF, thank God. If recent events are anything to go by
(s)he was probably exposed to some African drumming with a
contaminated drum head. One can only hope that the culture was not
tossed but will be available for genomic analysis. The American mills
processing imported wool and hair are long shut down.

A parallel report can be seen on CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease
Research & Policy) at
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/bt/anthrax/news/aug0911anthrax.html
but it adds nothing, patently coming from the same news release as the
Star Tribune report.
