Hong Kong health officials recorded 2 cases of necrotizing fasciitis caused by _Vibrio vulnificus_ in early August 2015.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1st case was recorded on [3 Aug 2015], involving an 85-year-old man with underlying illness. He was noted to have fever during a routine follow-up for his underlying illness at a public hospital on 30 Jul 2015 and was admitted on the same day. He was found to have left middle finger swelling upon admission. Excisional debridement was performed on [1 and 2 Aug 2015]. The operative diagnosis was necrotizing fasciitis. He was treated with antibiotics and his condition was serious. His blood specimen collected on [30 Jul 2015] grew _Vibrio vulnificus_. He had history of fish sting to his left middle finger while visiting a wet market on [27 Jul 2015]. His home contact was asymptomatic.

The 2nd case was recorded on [7 Aug 2015]. The patient was a 68-year-old man with underlying illnesses. He presented with fever and left ankle painful swelling on [31 Jul 2015] and was admitted to a public hospital on the same day. Excisional debridement was performed on [31 Jul 2015] with an operative diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. The fascial tissue and wound swab taken during operation on [31 Jul 2015] grew _Vibrio vulnificus_. He was treated with antibiotics and his condition was stable. Investigations revealed that he had visited wet market daily before onset and he did not recall any previous injury. His home contacts were asymptomatic.

[The following is excerpted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food & Drug Administration) at http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/CausesOfIllnessBadBugBook/ucm070473.htm:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism.

The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html). - Mod.LL
