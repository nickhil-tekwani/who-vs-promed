PORCINE REPRODUCTIVE AND RESPIRATORY SYNDROME - VIET NAM (03): ENZOOTIC

OIE member countries are not required to submit immediate
notification reports once they have informed the OIE that the disease
is considered epidemic [see comment] in the country. Outbreak data is
then submitted to the OIE using the 6-monthly and yearly reporting facility.

I would also like to take this opportunity to reconfirm that Viet Nam
remains transparent with regard to animal health information.

[The above firsthand information is appreciated. In fact, it is,
indeed, a reflection of Viet Nam's transparency with regard to animal
health information in responding to the following ProMED-mail request
for information that was included in posting 20080422.1429:

"Final report may mean the eradication of a disease; it may also
indicate that the disease has become enzootic (endemic) and,
consequently, follow-up reports became redundant.

The current information on PRRS as allegedly present in 10 of Viet
Nam's provinces, if accurate, indicates that the epizootic is
continuing. Confirmation or otherwise will be appreciated."

According to the current communication from Dr Huu Dung, it may be
concluded that PRRS (locally named "Blue ear pig disease") has become
enzootic (endemic) in Viet Nam (his mention of "epidemic" is, most
likaely, a typo).

We are also grateful to Dr Huu Dung for drawing our attention to a
typo in posting 20080506.1557, where South Korea was mentioned in the
commentary instead of Viet Nam. Any inconvenience caused by the error
is regretted. - Mod.AS]
