Update: Cardiac and Other Adverse Events Following Civilian Smallpox
Vaccination --- United States, 2003
---------------
During 24 Jan 2003-- 20 Jun 2003, smallpox vaccine was administered to 37
802 civilian health-care and public health workers in 55 jurisdictions to
prepare the United States for a possible terrorist attack using smallpox
virus. This report updates information on vaccine-associated adverse events
among civilians vaccinated since the beginning of the program and among
contacts of vaccinees, received by CDC from the Vaccine Adverse Event
Reporting System (VAERS) as of 20 Jun 2003.
2 cases of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) were diagnosed 3 months after
vaccination. For the potential relation between smallpox vaccine and DCM to
be assessed, identification of additional cases of DCM among vaccinees will
be essential. Physicians who treat smallpox vaccine recipients are
encouraged to evaluate and report patients with symptoms compatible with
DCM, including those that occur several months after vaccination.
In this vaccination program, CDC, the Food and Drug Administration, and
state health departments are conducting surveillance for vaccine-associated
adverse events among civilian vaccinees (1). As part of the vaccination
program, civilian vaccinees receive routine follow-up, and persons
reporting adverse events after vaccination receive follow-up as needed. The
U.S. Department of Defense is conducting surveillance for
vaccine-associated adverse events among military vaccinees and providing
follow-up care to those persons with reported adverse events.
Adverse events that have been associated with smallpox vaccination are
classified on the basis of evidence supporting the reported diagnoses.
Cases verified by virologic testing (or in some instances by other
diagnostic testing) are classified as confirmed (Table 1). Cases are
classified as probable if possible alternative etiologies are investigated
and excluded, and supportive information for the diagnosis is found. Cases
are classified as suspected if they have clinical features compatible with
the diagnosis, but either further investigation is required or
investigation of the case did not provide supporting evidence for the
diagnosis. All reports of events that follow vaccination (i.e., events
associated temporally) are accepted; however, reported adverse events are
not necessarily associated causally with vaccination, and some or all of
these events might be coincidental. This report includes cases reported as
of 20 Jun 2003 that either are under investigation or have a reported final
diagnosis. Because discussions of final case definitions are ongoing,
numbers and classifications of adverse events might change and will be
updated regularly in MMWR.
As of 20 Jun 2003, a total of 21 cases of myo/pericarditis were reported
among civilians. 4 of these were new suspected cases reported during 10 May
2003-20 Jun 2003, including 2 cases of pericarditis and 2 cases of
myocarditis (Table 1). In addition, 8 cases of ischemic heart disease have
been reported since the beginning of the civilian vaccination program,
including 5 cases of myocardial infarction (MI) and 3 cases of angina.
During 10 May 2003-20 Jun 2003, one case of suspected generalized vaccinia
was reported; no cases of eczema vaccinatum, erythema multiforme major,
fetal vaccinia, or progressive vaccinia were reported [see Table 1 at above
provided weblink]. In addition, 11 other serious adverse events were
reported, including 2 cases of cardiomyopathy identified 3 months after
smallpox vaccination in persons with no previous history of cardiomyopathy,
coronary artery disease (CAD), or congestive heart failure. As of 9 Jul
2003, these cases were under investigation. 9 other serious events were
reported, including 3 cases of chest pain, one case of gastro-esophageal
reflux disease, one case of cholecystitis, one case of sudden death caused
by atherosclerotic CAD 69 days postvaccination. 3 neurologic cases were
reported, including a central nervous system tumor diagnosed 28 days
postvaccination, a headache evaluated for encephalitis, and a cerebral
vascular accident. An additional 111 other nonserious events also were
reported [see Table 2 at above provided weblink]. Among the 610 vaccinees
with reported other nonserious adverse events during 24 Jan 2003--20 Jun
2003, the most common signs and symptoms were fever (n = 121), rash (n =
114), headache (n = 103), pain (n = 95), and fatigue (n = 85) [see Table 2
at above provided weblink]. All of these commonly reported events are
consistent with mild expected reactions following receipt of smallpox
vaccine. Some vaccinees reported multiple signs and symptoms.
During 10 May 2003-20 Jun 2003, no vaccinia immune globulin was released
for civilian vaccinees in the pre-event vaccination program, excluding
persons involved in investigational new drug studies. No cases of vaccine
transmission from civilian vaccinees to their contacts have been reported
during the vaccination program [see Table 3 at above provided weblink]. A
total of 14 cases of transmission from military personnel to civilian
contacts have been reported since the program began.
Case Reports
Case 1. On 25 Feb 2003, a woman aged 53 years with a history of untreated
borderline hypertension and obesity was revaccinated; 7 days later, she had
fatigue. On 18 Mar 2003, she continued to have fatigue and dyspnea, and she
had symptoms of an upper respiratory infection and sinusitis for which she
was prescribed antibiotics. On 16 Apr 2003, she saw her physician for an
unrelated problem and was noted to have elevated blood pressure (150/100
mm/Hg). She was started on hydrochlorthiazide; her fatigue continued, and
she had increasing exertional dyspnea. Other medications included
postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy and antihistamines for seasonal
allergies. She had no history of ischemic or valvular heart disease,
autoimmune or metabolic disorders, excessive alcohol consumption, or
exposure to other known cardiotoxic agents.
On 21 May 2003, she had a routine scheduled physical examination performed
by her regular physician. On cardiac examination, a murmur not detected
previously was noted. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed a left bundle
branch block (LBBB), which was reported to be a new finding. On 28 May
2003, an echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular (LV) wall thickness,
but mild dilatation with diffuse hypokinesis, moderate systolic function
impairment, an ejection fraction (EF) of 35 percent (normal: greater than
50 percent), and mild mitral regurgitation.
On 30 May2003, she reported to the emergency department with nonradiating,
burning chest pain without dizziness, dyspnea, or palpitations. She was
evaluated and had a cardiac catheterization, which showed no significant
CAD but moderate global hypokinesis and EF of 35 percent. The findings were
indicative of a nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy. She began treatment
with ramipril and metoprolol and has continued working.
Case 2. On 24 Feb 2003, a woman aged 55 years with a history of obesity and
moderately well-controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and
hyperlipidemia was revaccinated. 9 days after vaccination, she had
myalgias, arthralgias, and a temperature of 100 F (37.8 C) that resolved
within 4 days; she reported no chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations. On 24
Mar 2003, during a routine medical appointment, she reported continuing
fatigue but no other symptoms. She had a family history of premature CAD
but no history of angina, MI, congestive heart failure, autoimmune disease,
excessive alcohol consumption, exposure to cardiotoxins, or metabolic
disorders other than DM. Her medications included lisinopril,
hydrochlorthiazide, atorvastatin, feofibrate, and metformin.
On 17 May 2003, she had 2 brief episodes of palpitations, which did not
recur. On 3 Jun 2003, she saw her physician for a routine appointment and
complained of periodic fatigue since receiving her smallpox vaccination. On
examination, she was noted to have a cardiac murmur not detected
previously. On 11 Jun 2003, an EKG showed an LBBB that was not present on
her most recent previous EKG in 1996. An echocardiogram showed moderate LV
dilatation with spherical loss of architecture, moderate-to-severe
symmetrical hypokinesis of all regional wall areas, severe depression of
systolic function, and EF of 25-30 percent. On June 24, an adenosine
sestamibi stress test showed no evidence of ischemia, moderate LV
enlargement, and EF of 23 percent, consistent with a nonischemic DCM. Her
baseline medications were adjusted, and she has continued working.

MMWR Editorial Note:
Cardiac adverse events including myocarditis and pericarditis have been
reported following smallpox vaccination (2). Evidence suggests that
myocarditis and pericarditis might be associated causally with vaccination
(3). The 2 cases of DCM described in this report represent the first known
temporal, although not necessarily causal, association of smallpox
vaccination and DCM. However, whether vaccine caused these illnesses or
whether the 2 cases were coincidental and would have occurred anyway is
unclear.
DCM is a syndrome characterized by cardiac enlargement and impaired
systolic function of the left and/or right ventricle. Patients can have
symptoms of congestive heart failure, syncope, arrhythmias, and systemic
and pulmonary emboli; greater than 40 causes of DCM have been described,
including alcohol, toxins, infections, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and
metabolic abnormalities (4--6). However, in approximately half of all
cases, the cause is not identified; these are called idiopathic DCM (5,6).
In a study of 673 patients admitted to a hospital with DCM, 81 (12 percent)
had evidence of myocarditis on endomyocardial biopsy (5). Infectious causes
of myocarditis include enteroviruses, adenoviruses, influenza, human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and hepatitis C (4,6,7). Onset of
viral-associated DCM can occur within 2-3 months of infection; however,
many patients do not report previous viral symptoms or symptoms of
myocarditis, and the time of onset of symptomatic DCM can be subtle and
gradual. For these reasons, determining the timing of infection and
attributing causality in many patients with viral-associated DCM is
difficult. The mechanisms responsible for virus-related myocardial damage
are not well understood; however, an autoimmune response is likely (6,7).
Patients with DCM generally have echocardiograms that demonstrate dilated
LV end-diastolic diameter and global or regional wall dyskinesia with poor
LV contractile function (ejection fraction of less than 45 percent), often
with some compensatory increased wall thickness. Viral studies might
indicate infection (6). The use of endomyocardial biopsy in patients with
probable DCM is not recommended routinely because less than 5 percent of
patients have a condition for which a specific therapy is indicated (4--8).
In one study, 1/4 of patients reporting to a major medical center with
symptomatic DCM died within a year, and half died within 5 years (6). Among
those with myocarditis, survival rates are somewhat better (75 percent
survival at 5 years and approximately 55 percent at 10 years) (9).
Smallpox vaccination has not been associated previously with DCM. Because
smallpox vaccination appears to be associated causally with myocarditis,
which can cause DCM, further evaluation is warranted. DCM in either of the
2 cases described in this report could have been associated with other
etiologies (e.g., preceding or interceding illnesses). As in other cases of
DCM, attributing causality in these cases is difficult. The expected rate
of DCM in this population is being calculated to determine whether the
observed rate of DCM among civilian vaccinees (2 per 38 000) is higher than
expected. Surveillance and follow-up are ongoing to identify additional
cases of DCM among vaccinees. Guidelines for evaluation of possible DCM
cases following vaccination are being developed. Clinicians who treat
smallpox vaccinees should report patients with clinical presentations
compatible with DCM to their state health department and to VAERS (1).

[ProMED-mail has been following these reports on possible cardiac
complications following smallpox vaccination. It should be noted that to
date there have been approximately 38 000 smallpox vaccinations
administered to the civilian population and another approximately 450 000
doses administered to the military. These numbers should be kept in mind
when evaluating/interpreting the current reports on adverse events, as
these are relatively small numbers, especially when compared with
previously studied rates of adverse events following smallpox vaccination,
where the rates are cited as per 1 000 000 doses administered. Other
factors to keep in mind are the differences in the populations vaccinated
in this current round, with the majority of the 38 000 civilian vaccinees
presumably being re-vaccinees in older age groups (specific information on
the age distributions of the civilian vaccinees was not readily available
at the time of preparation of this posting), whereas those vaccinated in
the military population tended to be majority primary vaccinees (70.5
percent), presumably in the age group born after routine childhood smallpox
vaccinations were discontinued in the United States (1972).
Information on adverse events in the military population can be seen at
<http://www.smallpox.army.mil/event/SPSafetySum.asp>.
In 5.5 months, the DoD administered 450 293 smallpox vaccinations (70.5
percent primary vaccinees and 29.5 percent revaccinees). In 2 settings, 0.5
percent and 3.0 percent of vaccine recipients needed short-term sick leave.
Most adverse events occurred at rates below historical rates. One case of
encephalitis and 37 cases of acute myopericarditis developed after
vaccination; all cases recovered. Among 19 461 worker-months of clinical
contact, there were no cases of transmission of vaccinia from worker to
patient, no cases of eczema vaccinatum or progressive vaccinia, and no
attributed deaths.
Information on the age distribution of all vaccinees by prior vaccination
status, as well as similar information on the reported cases of adverse
events by type of adverse event, would be of interest to further analyze
and interpret the current observations on adverse events following receipt
of smallpox vaccine in the United States. It should also be noted that
most states have discontinued vaccination activities pending further
information on these reported cardiac adverse events (of note the reported
number of vaccinations given to date in the civilian population as of 4 Jul
2003 has not significantly changed since the end of May
<http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/spvaccin.htm>), albeit there have been
vaccinations performed as part of the Monkeypox outbreak control (see
ProMED-mail posting Monkeypox, human, prairie dogs - USA (15)
20030710.1692, which mentions 30 individuals were vaccinated as part of the
Monkeypox outbreak). - Mod.MPP]
