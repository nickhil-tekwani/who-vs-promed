[1] Cholera - South Sudan (Northern Liech) IDPs

The International Organization for Migration (IOM) says about 78 suspected cholera cases with 5 confirmed have been reported since 16 Oct 2016 at the UN camp in Bentiu town. "Immediately treating and halting the spread of cholera is critical in this site, where more than 101 500 internally displaced persons (IDPs) are living in very close quarters," said IOM Health Officer Dr. Andrew Mbala.

In a press release seen by Radio Tamazuj on 3 Nov 2016, the aid group said it was able to conduct a site-wide oral cholera vaccination (OCV) campaign, completing 2 rounds of the OCV for 71 200 people, the approximate population of the Bentiu site in June 2015. But more than 30 000 new arrivals have come to the site since the campaign was conducted, according to IOM. The organization pointed out that it is managing oral rehydration points to treat patients presenting cholera symptoms at its 2 primary health care clinics in the site, while referring severe cases to the Medecins Sans Frontieres clinic for in-patient care. IOM noted that it has also formed Handwashing Championship leagues, which bring students together from across the UN camp to demonstrate their handwashing skills.

[2] Cholera - Yemen
Date: Thu 3 Nov 2016

In 4 weeks since Yemeni health officials 1st announced a cholera outbreak on 6 Oct 2016, from 11 cases, the number has jumped to more than 2070 suspected cases this week. There are 8 confirmed deaths because of cholera and 38 suspected to have died from the infection.

According to the WHO, more than 7.6 million people are currently living in areas affected by the outbreak, while more than 3 million internally displaced persons are especially vulnerable. Unless the primary causes of the outbreak are addressed, cholera cases are likely to increase, with predictions of up to 76 000 additional cases across 15 governorates, including 15 200 severe cases requiring admission for treatment.

Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, already had a weak and unsustainable infrastructure and a vulnerable health sector. Both have been severely damaged as a result of the 18-month long Saudi-led war on the country since March 2015.

The cholera outbreak has exacerbated Yemen's health crisis, where half the country's health facilities have been rendered non-operational.

"There's a total collapse in the entire health sector," said Rana Sidani from WHO's regional office. And now 2/3rds of Yemen's population don't have access to safe drinking water. "The infrastructure is very damaged; it has affected water supplies."

The infection has spread in 9 governorates, including Taiz, Aden, Lahj, Al-Hudaydah, Hjjah, the capital Sanaa, Al-Baida, Dhammar and Ibb. No cases have appeared in the northeast governorates.

The armed conflict in Yemen, which isn't limited to the Saudi-led coalition but also extends to besieged southern areas resisting Houthi control, with little or no access to food and medical supplies, has caused internal migration of millions of Yemenis, many of whom are continuously moving from one governorate to the other, thus spreading the disease across southwest Yemen. There is also external migration of thousands from neighboring Ethiopia and Djbouti. "This has exacerbated the problem," said Sidani.

According to the World Food Program (WFP), one in every 5 in Yemen is severely food insecure. More than 14 million Yemenis are already food insecure, including more than 7 million in desperate need of food assistance, in addition to facing a measles outbreak, famine and malnourishment. In some areas, like Hodeidah governorate, Global Acute Malnutrition rates among children under 5 as high as 31 per cent have been recorded, more than double the emergency threshold of 15 per cent. Almost half of all children countrywide are irreversibly stunted, according to the WFP. As a result, the organization was forced to resort to emergency funds from its main headquarters in Geneva and regional office in Cairo. With the help of health partners in Yemen, the money is funding emergency units in existing hospitals and health facilities mandated to address cholera only.

The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As cited in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015, oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant and colleagues (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, references 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in reference 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
