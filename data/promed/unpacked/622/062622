Summary
-------
Lumpy skin disease (LSD) caused by the lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV) is a vector-borne disease of cattle and Asian water buffalo that causes substantial economic losses and requires technically sound and coordinated efforts for its prevention and control. It is on the OIE (World Organisation for Animal Health) list of notifiable diseases.

LSD was introduced into Bangladesh, China, and India, beginning from July 2019. In 2020 the disease spread to other parts of China and India as well as Nepal and Bhutan. This document compiles the latest information available on the LSD situation in South, Southeast, and East Asia and describes the complex bovine value chain in the region.

A qualitative risk assessment of the likelihood of introduction and/or spread of LSD in 23 countries in South, East, and Southeast Asia covering the period October-December 2020 was conducted. Please note, this risk assessment takes into account information available up to 31 Oct 2020.

1. Cambodia, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam have been assessed at high risk of LSD introduction with moderate uncertainty due to the presence of LSDV in South Asia and China, the high number of susceptible cattle and buffalo, significant informal trade in cattle and buffalo and their products between these countries and LSD-affected countries, poor biosecurity in cattle/buffalo production systems and along the value chain, the moderate abundance of competent vectors during October-December, and the current absence of vaccination.

2. Afghanistan and Mongolia have been assessed at moderate risk of LSD introduction with high uncertainty, and Pakistan with moderate uncertainty, due to the presence of LSD in South Asia and China, the high number or density of susceptible cattle and buffalo, the informal trade in cattle and buffalo and their products between these countries and LSD-affected countries, poor biosecurity in cattle/buffalo production systems and along the value chain, the very low (in Afghanistan and Mongolia), or low to moderate (in Pakistan) abundance of competent vectors during October-December, and the current absence of vaccination.

3. Brunei Darussalam, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Timor-Leste have been assessed at low to moderate risk of LSD introduction with moderate uncertainty due to the absence of LSD in neighbouring countries and/or the remoteness of these countries, the lower density of susceptible cattle and buffalo, and/or major live cattle and buffalo imports mainly from Oceania, the small informal trade in cattle and buffalo and their products between these countries only or the (quasi)-absence of informal trade, poor biosecurity in cattle/buffalo production systems and along the value chain, the very low (for Democratic People's Republic of Korea) or moderate abundance of competent vectors during October-December, and the current absence of vaccination.

4. Japan and the Republic of Korea have been assessed at very low risk of LSD introduction with moderate uncertainty due to the absence of LSD in immediate neighbouring countries and/or the remoteness of these countries, the smaller number of susceptible cattle and buffalo, live cattle and buffalo imports from LSD-free countries, the absence of informal imports of live cattle and buffalo and their products, moderate to high biosecurity in cattle/buffalo production systems and along the value chain, the very low to low abundance of competent vectors during October-December, and the current absence of vaccination.

5. Singapore has been assessed at negligible risk of LSD introduction with low uncertainty.

6. Among countries already affected, Bangladesh, India, and Nepal have been assessed at high risk of LSD spread with low uncertainty, and moderate uncertainty for Bhutan and China, due to the widespread presence of LSD in parts of these countries (except Bhutan), the high number of susceptible cattle and buffalo, the significant informal trade in cattle and buffalo and their products within these countries, poor biosecurity in cattle/buffalo production systems and along the value chain, the very low to moderate abundance of competent vectors during October-December (depending on latitude and altitude), and the current absence of large-scale vaccination targeting susceptible livestock.

The economic impact of LSD on South, East, and Southeast countries was estimated to be up to USD 1.45 billion in direct losses of livestock and production. The detection of an exotic disease may have severe trade implications for infected countries. Asian exports of live cattle and buffalo meat and meat products, dairy products, and hides accounted for USD 5.5 billion in 2017. The cost effectiveness estimate in this paper demonstrates a strong economic justification for vaccination under any scenario, since direct vaccination costs are lower than estimated direct losses, even without considering potential additional indirect losses. Regional funding mechanisms and approaches to harmonize vaccination strategies should be explored.

This document provides an overview of LSD control approaches, including prevention.
We discuss priority control methods including:
1. vaccination of susceptible herds with higher than 80 percent coverage;
2. movement control of cattle and buffalo and quarantine; and
3. slaughter campaigns (where feasible according to country context. to prevent spread.

The preferable vaccines for LSD are homologous -- based on the Neethling strain of LSDV, and heterologous -- based on goat pox virus (GTPV). Each batch of homologous and heterologous vaccines should be tested for quality and safety control. Countries need to decide which policy goal is realistic and feasible to devise national prevention and control strategies. In addition, a regional approach should ensure that individual national policy goals are compatible and harmonized control measures are implemented. It is important to note that maximum protection is achieved approximately 3 weeks post-vaccination.

The 5 countries assessed by the FAO as "at high risk of LSD introduction with moderate uncertainty", namely Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam, deserve particular, immediate attention. Delayed detection may cause severe economic losses. Viet Nam has already notified the OIE of its 1st outbreak (20201103.7911552).

The eastward spread of LSD in Asia, since 2016, accelerated in 2019, has eventually reached as far east as Taiwan; it is assumed to be wider spread than reported.
