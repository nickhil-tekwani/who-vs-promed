Re: Administration of immune globulin
---------------------------------------------
Experimental or epidemiological evidence that immune globulin [IG]
"is only effective if given within a 2-week period after exposure to
the disease" is not available, given the vagaries of dose and
exposure conditions that lead to acquisition of the virus, resulting
in longer incubation periods.
From a public health standpoint, the CDC avoids this controversy by
stating that "efficacy when administered >2 weeks after exposure has
not been established," which is an appropriate statement based on
analysis of the data (see: Prevention of Hepatitis A Through Active
or Passive Immunization: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP); MMWR, 19 May 2006 / 55(RR07);1-23
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5507a1.htm>).
Routine vaccination of children is an effective way to reduce
hepatitis A incidence in the United States. These updated
recommendations represent the final step in the childhood hepatitis A
immunization strategy (see: MMWR, 19 May 2006). But physicians and
other healthcare workers should appreciate the fact that immune
globulin given >2 weeks after exposure might still modulate or abort
the infection in some individuals. It would be helpful to know when
the source case became ill or jaundiced. IG should have been given to
other food handlers working in that establishment as soon as the
diagnosis was made, but the risk of transmission to patrons is
unlikely unless there are extenuating circumstances surrounding the
disease in the contact case (e.g., diarrhea, etc). In my opinion, the
restaurant should be responsible for costs related to the
administration of immune globulin to its patrons.
