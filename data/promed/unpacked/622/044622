Recent reports of human parechovirus (PeV) in the United States, 2022
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is issuing this Health Alert Network (HAN) health advisory to inform clinicians and public health departments that parechovirus (PeV) is currently circulating in the United States. Since May 2022, CDC has received reports from healthcare providers in multiple states of PeV infections in neonates and young infants.

Parechoviruses are a group of viruses known to cause a spectrum of disease in humans. Clinicians are encouraged to include PeV in the differential diagnoses of infants presenting with fever, sepsis-like syndrome, or neurologic illness (seizures, meningitis) without another known cause, and to test for PeV in children with signs and symptoms compatible with PeV infection (see below). Commercial laboratory assays, multiplex platforms for meningitis and encephalitis, and testing through state public health laboratories (SPHLs) are available to test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for PeV to confirm a diagnosis. CDC laboratory support is also available for testing and typing patient specimens.

To date, all PeV-positive specimens tested and typed at CDC were type PeV-A3. Because there is presently no systematic surveillance for PeVs in the United States, it is not clear how the number of PeV cases reported in 2022 compares to previous seasons. PeV laboratory testing has become more widely available in recent years, and it is possible that increased testing has led to a higher number of PeV diagnoses compared with previous years.

[2] Tennessee cluster

Doctors at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say an unusually high number of dangerous viral infections have been diagnosed among newborns across the US this year [2022], including one "unusually large cluster" of nearly 2 dozen cases at a single hospital in Tennessee.

The infections -- which are caused by a common parechovirus -- can trigger a range of troubling symptoms in babies including fever, fussiness, poor feeding, and strange rashes.

While life-threatening cases are still rare, at least one newborn child has died from the virus this year [2022], and others have suffered debilitating consequences.

Federal health officials suspect that the uptick in severe cases "might reflect relaxation of COVID-19 isolation measures," and the fact that more diseases of all kinds are traveling around from person to person now.

In a new report released on Thursday [28 Jul 2022], CDC clinicians detailed how at one children's hospital in Tennessee, 23 "previously healthy infants" ranging in age from just 5 days to 3 months old were diagnosed with parechovirus infections during a 6-week period from mid-April to the end of May [2022].

The most common symptoms those children shared included:
- fevers (20/23 babies)
- fussiness (13/23 babies)
- poor feeding (8/23 babies)

The cluster of cases is especially concerning because, while parechovirus infections are common in young kids, typically that number of cases would be logged over a period of several months at this hospital, not weeks.

Earlier in July [2022], the CDC warned clinicians nationwide that a dangerous form of parechovirus, PeV-A3, is circulating in "multiple states." Disease experts are recommending doctors test any babies who may present with fevers, sepsis-like syndrome, seizures, or meningitis, "without another known cause."

Of the 23 patients in this study, 21 recovered from their viral infections without any known complications. But one baby had possible hearing loss and blood-clotting issues, while another went through "persistent seizures," and clinicians expect that child will have "severe" developmental delays.

Most children will contract some form of parechovirus by the time they enter kindergarten, but the viral illness can be especially dangerous for the very littlest babies who get it (those under 3 months old). In 2017, pediatricians and infectious disease experts in New Zealand said parechovirus "is increasingly being recognized as a potentially severe viral infection" in babies.

"I always tell parents that there's nothing that they can do to really prevent these infections when they happen," Dr. Claire Bocchini, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Texas Children's Hospital, previously told Insider.

Bocchini says parechovirus type A3 can prompt severe infections in babies' brains, leading to seizures and brain damage.

She recommends parents and caregivers practice "very good handwashing," especially after going to the bathroom and changing diapers, and keep newborn infants away from sick people as much as possible.

"Babies, unfortunately, are at risk of severe outcomes for multiple viruses," she said. "But this is certainly a scary one."

Abstract
--------
Parechoviruses are emerging pathogens of humans often affecting the pediatric age group, with a growing line of evidence implicating them as agents of a broad spectrum of clinical syndromes in adults. However, because many clinicians are not familiar with the manifestation of the infections, they are not included in the list of diagnostic pathogens. Furthermore, due to the indistinguishable feature of the infection compared with other common pathogens, a large number of cases are likely to go unchecked. Some may develop asymptomatic infection and recover without overt clinical disease. In this manuscript, we reviewed available literature on parechovirus infection in adult and summarized information relating to epidemiology, clinical manifestation, laboratory diagnosis, and therapeutics. The information provided should help in early case detection and support an evidence-based clinical decision. - Mod.LK
