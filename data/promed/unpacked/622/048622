Shredded lettuce was the "most likely" ingredient that spread _Escherichia
coli_ [O157:H7] bacteria in the recent outbreak among hundreds of customers
of Taco Bell restaurants in the north east, federal health officials said
last night, 13 Dec 2006.
The new conclusion was not based on testing of food samples, which so far
have been negative for _E. coli_. Instead, investigators surveyed what the
stricken people ate and compared that with what their dining companions who
remained healthy had eaten.
Those statistics narrowed the potential sources to lettuce, cheddar cheese,
and ground beef -- all common to many Taco Bell items. Investigators then
reviewed the record of those foods in past _E. coli_ outbreaks and the way
those foods are handled. The beef, for example, is cooked, and Taco Bell
says the cheese is pasteurized.
"We think that shredded lettuce consumed at Taco Bell restaurants was the
most likely cause of the outbreak," Dr Christopher Braden, an
epidemiologist for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
said in a telephone news conference. "We're fairly confident" that lettuce
is to blame, he said, but added, "we're not done with the investigation."
State and federal laboratories continue testing the backlog of food samples
taken from the implicated Taco Bell restaurants. But because of the lag in
symptoms and the fast turnover of food supplies, the contaminated material
may already have been consumed or discarded before samples were taken,
officials say.
The Food and Drug Administration is conducting what it calls a "trace back"
inquiry, tracking lettuce from the farms through its processing, packaging
and distribution. Dr David Acheson, chief medical officer at that agency's
Center for Food Safety and Nutrition, declined to specify the farm or supplier.
Taco Bell had already switched to a new produce supplier, Taylor Farms, for
restaurants in the states struck by _E. coli_: New York, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Delaware. The company's president, Greg Creed, said the
change, which occurred before lettuce was cited, was made "as a
precautionary move."
Two factors have hampered the investigation. Taco Bell's practice of using
the same combination of ingredients in several items made it "hard to tease
out" which ones were contaminated, Dr Braden said. And Dr. Acheson said
that unlike the spinach involved in an earlier _E. coli_ outbreak in 2006,
lettuce did not have easily traced package labels.
As for why lettuce and spinach seem to be susceptible to _E. coli_, Dr
Acheson said, "I'm not sure we really know the answer." He speculated that
lettuce "just lends itself to catching bugs by its physical topography" and
that bacteria "are more likely to get stuck in the crevices of spinach
plants or lettuce plants."

The FDA today, 13 Dec 2006, narrowed its investigation of an outbreak of
_E. coli_ O157:H7 infections linked to Taco Bell restaurants in north
eastern states by focusing its efforts on finding the sources of shredded
lettuce served at the stores. This new focus is based on the fact that 3
items -- shredded lettuce, cheddar cheese and cooked ground beef -- were
implicated in a study conducted by CDC) as the items most likely to have
been the vehicles of pathogen (disease-causing agent) transmission in this
outbreak. Based on a number of other factors, as well as food processing
techniques used for cheese (pasteurization) and ground beef (cooking),
lettuce is considered overall to be the single most likely source of the
outbreak at this time.
The peak of the outbreak occurred in the last week of Nov 2006. A total of
71 cases in 5 states -- Delaware, 2 cases; New Jersey, 33 cases; New York,
22 cases; Pennsylvania, 13 cases; and South Carolina, one case -- have been
reported to CDC. The single case in South Carolina occurred in a person who
ate at a Taco Bell in Pennsylvania. The number of new cases has declined
substantially.
The information about items likely to have transmitted the pathogen in this
outbreak comes from a CDC "case control" study, which involves interviewing
ill and well Taco Bell restaurant patrons about what food items they
consumed. By comparing foods consumed by ill and well persons,
investigators can show statistical links to particular food ingredients.
This does not establish that these foods are the causes of the outbreak,
but it does give clues as to where further investigation should focus to
try to find hard evidence of the cause.
Because of this, FDA investigators are further expediting review of Taco
Bell records obtained from the firm in order to trace the distribution
channels of the lettuce and identify the farm or farms where the lettuce
was grown, as well as all firms and facilities that handled the product
between harvest and delivery.
FDA has no indication that lettuce or cheese served at any other
restaurant, or lettuce or cheese sold in any other venue, is connected with
this outbreak. The agency is aware of the outbreaks of _E. coli_ O157:H7 at
Taco John's restaurants in Iowa and Minnesota, and is monitoring these
closely in cooperation with state health authorities. Based on available
information these outbreaks do not appear at this time to be related to the
Taco Bell outbreak.
FDA continues to collaborate with CDC, and with state and local health
officials, to determine how the outbreak occurred and find the source of
suspect food items.
