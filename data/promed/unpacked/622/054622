Mac, a mischievous, young Asian elephant who had become one of the
Houston Zoo's most popular animals, became ill and died Sunday [9 Nov
2008]. He was 2.

He entertained visitors with his ability to dance, produce music on
wind pipes, and stand on his head. Many zoo staff members, won over
by his intelligence, playfulness and occasional headstrong ways, were
devastated by the death of the 2200-pounds (998 kg)-and-still growing animal.

"Everyone shares in the grief. Mac was embraced by the community in
the past 2 years. It was sudden. It was quick, and we just couldn't
save him," said zoo director Rick Barongi, who choked up with tears
and stepped away from the microphone during a press conference Monday
[10 Nov 2008].

Elephant keepers realized he was ill Sunday morning [9 Nov 2008] when
he was sluggish, had no appetite, and his head was swollen, said
Joseph Flanagan, the zoo's chief veterinarian. Flanagan said he and
other members of the veterinary staff viewed the symptoms as signs
that Mac had elephant herpes virus.

The virus weakens blood vessels, and they begin to leak blood,
Flanagan said. The heart pumps faster to compensate and sometimes
fails. The cause of elephant herpes virus remains unknown, but it is
not transmitted sexually, Flanagan said. Many elephants carry the
virus in latent form from an early age, and veterinarians remain
puzzled over why it flares up in some animals.

After veterinarians administered an antiviral medication, Mac
appeared to recover. He began playing and eating Sunday afternoon [9
Nov 2008]. But that night, "unfortunately, he stood up, yawned, sat
down, and passed," Flanagan said.

Mac's mother, Shanti, and Methai, a female elephant who helped mother
him in the maternally-run herd, stayed by his body, grieving him, Barongi said.

A necropsy -- an animal autopsy -- will be performed at the state
veterinary diagnostic lab at Texas A&M University. His body will be
cremated there.

After his birth, he got his name through an Internet contest. Zoo
officials chose "Mac" because they thought it was apt -- he was big
like a Mack truck.

Zoo spokesman Brian Hill said, "There was almost this eagerness to
please in him. He enjoyed interacting with the keepers. He was all
boy -- he enjoyed knocking his wind pipes. Sometimes, he'd take a box
of produce, smash it, and eat the produce along with parts of the box."

With his death, 5 elephants remain at the zoo, including Mac's father, Thai.

Mac is the 6th elephant that was kept at the zoo or was born at the
zoo to die from elephant herpes, Barongi said. Singgah, 10, died from
the disease at the zoo in 2000. Kimba, 8, died in 2004. Three
elephants born at the zoo died at zoos in Berlin, Chicago, and
Canada, Barongi said.

Flanagan said most elephants are infected with the virus, so he and
others have no reason to believe that the virus was especially
rampant among the zoo's elephants.

The virus wasn't detected until 1995. Veterinarians haven't found a
test yet to detect when elephants are carrying it in its latent form.

After composing himself, Barongi returned to the microphone and said
a cure or vaccine will be found only if veterinarians devote
themselves to finding one.

Among the zoo's remaining elephants is 3-year-old Tucker, who was
Mac's playmate. But the herd may be growing. "Shanti's in the early
stage of pregnancy," Barongi said.
