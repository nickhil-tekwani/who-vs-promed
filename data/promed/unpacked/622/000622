Two cases of bird flu have been confirmed in poultry farms in northwest and central China, with no humans found infected so far, the Ministry of Agriculture said Saturday [8 Oct 2016].

The cases -- one in Jinchang, Gansu Province, and the other in Xiaogan, Hubei Province -- were confirmed as avian influenza H5N6 after being detected a few days ago, the ministry said in a statement.

"The epidemic situation has been well controlled," the statement said, adding that local authorities have killed hundreds of thousands of fowl to prevent the spread of the disease.

The world's 1st human H5N6 infection was reported in May 2014 in southwest China's Sichuan Province. But there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission.

[The HPAI (highly pathological avian influenza) H5N6 virus has been detected in poultry in China, Laos, and Viet Nam since its initial emergence in 2014 as a reassortant of H5N1 and H6N6.

According to the official information on China's Ministry of Agriculture website, dated 8 Oct 2016, the outbreak in Jinchang (Gansu), reported on 2 Oct 2016, involved 30 000 birds of which 18 000 died, while the outbreak in Xiaogan (Hubei), reported on 4 Oct 2016, involved 4338 birds of which 3934 died. Both were defined by the national influenza reference lab as HPAI H5N6. Stamping out was applied in both events (see, in Chinese, at http://www.moa.gov.cn/zwllm/yjgl/yqfb/201610/t20161008_5298228.htm).

China applies a stamping-out policy without vaccination for the handling of all HPAI strains in poultry.

In view of its recent resurgence in humans, China's authorities have issued in January 2016 a press release reassuring the public that there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of HPAI H5N6 (http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2016-01/15/c_135013921.htm).

WHO published the following risk assessment in June 2016 (http://www.who.int/csr/don/08-june-2016-ah5n6-china/en/):
"Although influenza A(H5N6) has caused severe infection in humans, until now human infections with the virus seem to be sporadic with no ongoing human to human transmission and close contacts of the case remain healthy. However, the characterization of this virus is ongoing and its implication to the evolution and emergence of a pandemic strain is unknown. The risk of international disease spread is considered to be low at this point in time. WHO continues to assess the epidemiological situation and conduct further risk assessment based on the latest information." - Mod.AS
