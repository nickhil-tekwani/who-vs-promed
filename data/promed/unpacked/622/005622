Increase in Leishmania in southern Sudan
---------------------------
A severe outbreak of the fly-borne parasitic disease Kala Azar is
devastating some southern Sudanese communities exhausted by
malnutrition and war, medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)
said Friday. Kala Azar, or Visceral Leishmaniasis, is transmitted by
the tiny sand fly and attacks people weakened by hunger and fatigue.
Fatal if untreated, the disease disrupts the liver and spleen,
causing fever and severe weight loss and an enlarged spleen. "It is
an overwhelming scene, with so many of the people coming to the
clinic every day more dead than alive," an MSF statement quoted MSF
Operational Director Jose-Antonio Bastos as saying. "The state of
these patients is appalling. They are being carried on stretchers for
days to make it to the clinic. They look pale and thin and are
extremely anemic." The disease is endemic in parts of the Eastern
African nations of Sudan, Ethiopia and Somalia and usually peaks at
this time of year. But the strength of the current out-break is
exceptional and shows a dramatic increase compared to the same
seasons in recent years, MSF said. "While peace talks go on, large
parts of southern Sudan are still inaccessible to aid organizations
and diseases like Kala Azar continue to claim
thousands of lives," MSF said. Sudan's government and southern rebels
are holding peace talks in Kenya to try to end a war that has killed
an estimated two million people since it began in 1983. The rebels in
the south, which is mainly animist with a small percentage of
Christians and Muslims, have been fighting for more autonomy from the
mainly Muslim north. One MSF official contacted by telephone said he
knew of hundreds of Sudanese, almost all of them from communities
uprooted by war, who were suffering the disease and who would almost
certainly die without medical attention.

[Leishmaniasis is endemic in Sudan. The absence of control measures
in the areas affected by the civil war may be an explanation for the
present epidemic. Leishmaniasis is one of the infections associated
with HIV infection and HIV may be an associated factor in an increase
in Leishmaniasis. - Mod.EP]
