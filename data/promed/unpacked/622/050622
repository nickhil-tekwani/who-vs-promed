Health officials are warning pet owners after a cat tested positive for rabies in Gadsden county.

The Florida department of health says It's just one of dozens of confirmed reports of rabies in Florida in 2019 which is why they are trying to spread the word to vaccinate your pets.

It started with a Quincy resident having to put down her cat after learning it had rabies and couldn't be cured.

And other pet owners are taking the news seriously.

"And I hope it does everyone the same way. It's an inexpensive piece of good mind, you know, to make you feel better about your animals," said AG. [She] has what she calls "Noah's ark" on her Quincy farm full of everything except llamas and sheep.

She says none of her animals have ever contracted the virus because she keeps her furry friends up to date on their vaccinations. "Animals depend on us to take care of them. You as an owner need to be responsible for your animal and don't put them in jeopardy. Don't put your family in jeopardy, your neighbors in jeopardy," said [AG].

And every time Lily gets vaccinated, she leaves the vet with this rabies tag. So other pet owners know she's up to date on her shots.

"It's true every year if you do nothing else, rabies vaccinate your animals because they can transmit the rabies virus to the owners as well," said Dr Larry Helm. [Some state/counties/parishes, allow for a 3-year vaccine, so you are only updating rabies vaccines every 3 years. However, other vaccines, such as canine distemper may need to be administered yearly.- Mod.TG]

Dr Helm with the Quincy animal hospital says if your animal is exposed bring them to the vet immediately. But once they're showing [signs] it's likely too late.

"The way you stop rabies is to prevent it from happening," said Helm.

The Florida Department of health has issued a rabies alert for Gadsden county for the next 60 days.

They warn all domestic animals are at risk if they are not vaccinated for rabies.

Wild animals that commonly pass the virus: raccoons, bats, skunks and foxes.

[2] Connecticut (New London county): bobcat, horse, human exposure

A bobcat that attacked a golfer in Connecticut shortly after scratching a horse has tested positive for rabies.

The bobcat was shot and killed by state environmental police shortly after it attacked a man [Thu 18 Apr 2019] on the Mohegan Sun Golf Course in Sprague [New London county], Connecticut.

The state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection said in a statement the wildcat was taken for testing at the UConn Medical Lab, which confirmed it has rabies.

The golfer and the horse's owner have been notified. [The owner of the horse is hopefully having the horse treated as well as putting the horse under close observation for rabies. Cats claws can harbor disease and can transmit disease. We hope the horse is not affected by this awful disease and is recovering from his wounds. This is an excellent example of why a rabies vaccination against this disease is important in horses. - Mod.TG]

The golfer, a man in his 60s whose name was not made public, was treated at a hospital for scratches. [Hopefully he received more than just treatment for scratches or bites. He should have received post exposure prophylaxis against the rabies virus. - Mod.TG]

Bobcats are common in Connecticut, but attacks on humans are unusual. The last report of a bobcat attack on a human in the state was in Bozrah in August 2014.

Rabies is a deadly disease. It can be passed from animals to people and one of the biggest barriers of protection is to vaccinate your pets, whether a cat, a dog, a horse, or a cow. Vaccination to prevent this disease is critically important. - Mod.TG]
