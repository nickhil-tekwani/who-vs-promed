After Indre, Cher and Indre-et-Loire, now the tiger mosquito [_Aedes albopictus_] has been reported in Loiret, and colonization of the territory is inevitable, the regional health agency estimates, but we can adopt measures to limit its rapid spread.

This mosquito is establishing itself more and more on French soil in [metropolitan] France and is a vector of diseases [viruses] such as chikungunya, dengue fever and Zika. The Regional Health Agency [ARS] of the Centre-Val de Loire issued an alert for the presence of the tiger mosquito, which was detected in 4 sections.

The tiger mosquito arrived in the area in 2017. It is now found in these 4 sections: Indre, Cher, Indre-et-Loire, and most recently Loiret.

To prevent its spread and protect yourself, it is recommended to follow the correct procedures and to report its presence. The tiger mosquito is an invasive species capable of transmitting some tropical diseases [viruses] such as dengue, chikungunya or Zika. To do this, they must bite an infected person who has become infected while traveling to an area where the disease is actively spreading.

The 1st eggs of tiger mosquitoes in the area were observed this year on 22 Jun [2021], in the territory of the Castelroussine agglomeration [the urban community of Chateauroux, capital city of Indre]. It should now remain active until November; only its eggs will survive the winter.

ARS Centre-Val de Loire guarantees monitoring and control of mosquito-borne diseases since 2020. Insect monitoring and pesticide handling tasks are carried out by the Inovalys laboratory in Tours, which monitors more than 250 traps spread over the main populations and hazardous sites in the area.

In the medium term, colonization of the rest of the lands seems inevitable, but it is possible to slow it down and reduce the presence of mosquitoes thanks to some simple measures:

- Protect yourself from the tiger mosquito: no access to water!
- Be careful, the tiger mosquito breeds in it smallest water bowl: bottle caps are large enough for it!

It is possible to control the spread of mosquitoes by removing all places and objects that may contain water. If containers cannot be emptied, access to water must be eliminated, for example, by installing mosquito screens on rainwater tanks, sand in flowerpot saucers, etc.

These simple measures also make it possible to reduce the serious inconveniences associated with tiger mosquito bites. Consult your doctor in case of sudden fever, body aches or joint pain.

What does a tiger mosquito look like? The tiger mosquito can be identified by:

- Its small size -- 5 mm,
- Its color is very contrasting: it has black and white stripes on the legs and a white stripe from the head to the attachment of the wings,
- It is active and bites during the day.

[_Aedes albopictus_ continues to spread in France. Because its eggs can survive the winter by entering into diapause, it is likely to become established in these newly colonized areas. As noted earlier, _Aedes albopictus_ has been expanding its geographic range in southern Europe for several years. The rapid expanse northward in France is noteworthy. It has gone from 41 departments reported in April 2018 to 51 departments in 2019, 57 departments in 2020 and now to 64 departments. The established mosquito surveillance system in France doubtless will detect further expansion, as indicated in the above report. The risk of initiation of ongoing transmission of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses following introduction from elsewhere will depend on population abundance of mosquito vectors and susceptible human population densities, as well as the amount of time that people spend out-of-doors in areas where there is risk of bites by these mosquitoes.

Eradication of this mosquito from France is not possible with current pest control measures. This expansion will be an interesting situation to watch over the coming months and years. - Mod.TY
