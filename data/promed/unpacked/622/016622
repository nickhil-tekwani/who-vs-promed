First report of pepino mosaic virus on tomato in Spain. C Jorda, A Lazaro
Perez, P Martinez-Culebras, P Abad. Dpto. Ecosistemas Agroforestales,
Universidad Politecnica, Camino de Vera, 14, Spain. Plant Dis 2001; 85:
1292. Published online as D-2001-1029-01N, 2001. Accepted for publication
12 Jan 2001.
At the beginning of 2000, a damaging disease developed on protected tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_) crops grown in polyethylene greenhouses in
different regions of Spain. Production losses were estimated at 15 to 80
per cent.
The ... commonest signs were leaf distortion, chlorosis, and mosaic. Some
plants showed a dark green mosaic and bubbling of the leaf surface. Green
striations were also observed on the stem and sepals. Most of the diseased
plants had discolored fruits. Symptoms decreased as environmental
temperature increased. The involvement of Pepino mosaic [potexvirus
(PepMV) was suspected.
To identify the etiological agent, [about 500 symptomatic tomato plants
were collected from several locations in Alicante, Murcia, Almeria, and the
Canary Islands. Flexuous viral particles 510 nm long were observed by
transmission electron microscopy, suggesting the presence of a potexvirus
in the tissue extracts analyzed.
All samples were tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), ...
using polyclonal antibodies to Narcissus mosaic [potexvirus (Adgen,
Auchincriuve, Scotland), a virus serologically related to PepMV, and two
antisera specific to PepMV (Adgen, Scotland and DMSZ, Braunschweig,
Germany). PepMV was detected in 35 per cent of the samples.
Like PepMV, the virus infected (as confirmed by ELISA) greenhouse-grown
plants [as follows: _Datura stramonium_, _Nicandra physalodes_, _Nicotiana
benthamiana_, _N. clevelandii_, _Solanum tuberosum_, and _Vigna sinensis_.
[It ... did not infect _Capsicum anuum_, _Cucumis sativus_, _Chenopodium
amaranticolor_, _C. quinoa_, _Petunia Ã— hybrida_, _Phaseolus vulgaris_,
_Physalis floridana_, _N. glutinosa_, _N. rustica_, or _N. tabacum_. The
virus did infect _Gomphrena globosa_, which normally is not infected by PepMV.
The first report of PepMV was on pepino (_Solanum muricatum_) in Peru in
1974 (1). [PepMV ... has been recently reported in the Netherlands,
England, Germany, and France on protected tomato crops (2). To our
knowledge, this is the first report of PepMV in Spain, including the Canary
Islands.

[PepMV is easily spread, and this report documents its latest incursion
into Europe and its entry into the Canary Islands. Serious crop losses can
be expected due to PepMV infection in protected crops, especially if proper
phytosanitation methods (use of sterilized tools and benches, etc) are not
employed.
