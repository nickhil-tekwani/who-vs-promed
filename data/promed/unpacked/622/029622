Meningitis Kills 7 in Bauchi
-------------------------------
An outbreak of meningitis in Shira, Ganjuwa and Dass local government
areas of Bauchi state has claimed 7 lives, while 17 patients are in
critical condition in hospitals, Daily Trust investigations has
revealed.
Our correspondent, who was in Shira local government, where 11 cases
of the disease has been reported, with 4 people already dead as a
result of the infection, reports that some of the victims are lying
helplessly at the General Hospital, Yana, the headquarters of the
local government, with health personnel uncertain of what to do.
The Shira local government was said to have written a letter to the
state ministry of health for its intervention 3 weeks ago, when the
1st case was recorded, without any response from the ministry. The
chairman of the local government, Alhaji Sule Hassan Danja, was not
available to confirm the report, as he was said to have traveled to
Bauchi.

Deadly meningitis outbreaks in drought-stricken Kenya, Uganda
-----------------------------------------------
At least 12 people have died in the past 2 weeks from an outbreak of
meningitis in drought-stricken northern Kenya, officials said,
warning of an epidemic of the fatal disease.
Kenya's health ministry reported 57 cases of meningitis, 12 of them
fatal, since late January 2006 in West Pokot district near the border
with Uganda, which is struggling to contain an outbreak that has
killed 23 people since December 2005.
"If action is not taken, this can spread fast," said Thomas Ogaro,
head of the ministry's communicable disease division.
West Pokot, about 500 km (310 miles) northwest of Nairobi, is
inhabited by nomadic herders badly hit by the drought that threatens
millions with starvation across east Africa. Herders were forced to
move further than usual in search of water and pasture for their
livestock, which increased the chances of the illness spreading, he
said.
"The disease is rampant," Ibrahim Domongole, pastor of the Kasei
African Inland Church, told AFP, adding that at least 30 people had
died from meningitis. "The government says it is contained, but it is
not."
In neighboring Uganda, where 330 cases and 23 fatalities have been
reported in the northeast since 28 Dec 2005, the health ministry said
it had begun a mass immunization drive to stave off the spread of the
meningitis.
"We have embarked on a universal immunization of all people in (2
districts)," Dr. Sam Okware, director of health services at the
ministry told AFP, adding that 300 000 people were being targeted in
the campaign.

Meningococcal disease in Sudan
-----------------------------------
From 1-31 Jan 2006, 136 suspected cases and 15 deaths of
meningococcal disease have been reported in 6 states of Sudan. The
epidemic threshold has been crossed in 2 administrative units (Guli
in Blue Nile State and Wad el Heleu in Kassala State). One specimen
of cerebrospinal fluid has been found positive for _Neisseria
meningitidis_ serogroup A by latex test. Results from additional
specimens sent to the National Public Health Laboratory in Khartoum
are expected shortly.
The Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) had established a National Task
force including UNICEF, WHO and nongovernmental organizations. WHO is
supporting the FMOH in their field investigations, the provision of
outbreak control supplies, strengthening surveillance as well as in
the assessment of vaccination needs.

[Type A meningococcus has been identified in the Sudan outbreak.
Although the serotype involved in the Nigerian, Ugandan and Kenyan
cases is not stated, it is likely to be type A as well. Some
outbreaks in the past few years in the meningitis belt of central
Africa have also involved group W135. - Mod.LL]

Tests show 3 fatal cases of meningococcal disease in Europe not related
-----------------------------------------------
Lab tests show the cases of meningococcal disease that recently
killed 3 members of the USA military community in Germany within a
week were unrelated, according to the European Regional Medical
Command.
3 different strains of the disease killed a 20-year-old soldier with
the 1st Infantry Division in Wurzburg; a 26-year-old civilian with
the Spangdahlem Air Base Office of Special Investigation; and the
23-year-old wife of a soldier.
The lab results indicate that there is not an epidemic at hand,
according to Dr. (Lt. Col.) William Corr, chief of preventive
medicine at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center and ERMC's preventive
medicine consultant. "It's not a new or more virulently dangerous
germ that the community is exposed to that is being spread from
person to person," Corr said. "We don't have a forest fire that we
have to stomp out, but we do have to investigate it."
No other cases of meningococcal disease are being treated by USA
clinics in Germany, Corr said on Tue 7 Feb 2006. He said that was not
surprising, because meningococcal disease is not an easily spread
disease, as measles or chicken pox are. Instead, the germs that cause
meningococcal disease are spread in droplets through the mouth and
nose by direct and prolonged contact, such as kissing, or by the
sharing of utensils or directly sneezing into someone's face. The
disease is not transmitted through sexual activity, Corr said.
According to a press release from ERMC, one person died from Group B
meningococcal septicemia, while the 2 others died from non-identical
strains of Group C meningococcal meningitis. The tests were performed
at a German laboratory in Wurzburg. Persons who had contact with the
3 victims have been given antibiotic pills, Corr said.
According to the German government, the annual occurrence of the
disease in Germany is slightly less than one person in 100 000. The
primary agency that tracks meningococcal cases in Germany is the
Robert Koch Institute in Berlin.
Since the beginning of 2006 -- or just over 5 weeks -- there have
been at least 64 confirmed cases in Germany, according to Wiebke
Hellenbrand, an epidemiologist with the institute. In the 1st 6 weeks
of 2004 and 2005, there were 89 and 79 cases, respectfully. So far,
Hellenbrand said, there is no indication of anything strange afoot in
Germany with respect to meningococcal disease.
It appears the deaths of the 3 Americans represent "an unlucky
coincidence of cases," she said.
