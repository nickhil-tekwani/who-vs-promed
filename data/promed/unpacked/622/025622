Poliovirus weekly update, 19 Jun 2019, WHO
-----------------------
New wild poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 2
Environment: 2

New cVDPV poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 1
Environment: 5
Others: 1

Headlines
- In Angola, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed.
- In the Horn of Africa, a cVDPV2 case has been detected in Somali province, Ethiopia, linked to the ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak affecting the region (notably Somalia). Since detection of the cVDPVs in the Horn of Africa in 2018, Ethiopia had declared these outbreaks -- together with the Ministries of Health of Kenya and Somalia -- to be a regional public health emergency and has been participating in regional outbreak response.
- In Papua New Guinea, more than one million children are to be vaccinated against measles, rubella and polio [see https://www.who.int/papuanewguinea/news/detail/17-06-2019-papua-new-guinea-over-1-million-children-to-be-vaccinated-against-measles-rubella-and-polio for more information on this]. To mark the launch of the campaign, the Honorable Prime Minister James Marape personally administered polio vaccine at a launch ceremony.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Pakistan: 2 WPV1 cases and 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample;
- Nigeria: 5 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) positive environmental samples;
- Ethiopia: 1 cVDPV2 case;
- Somalia: 1 cVDPV2 isolated from a healthy community contact; and
- Iran: 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample.

Afghanistan
- No wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2019 remains 8.

Pakistan
- 2 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week, from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province, one from Shangla district and the other one from Bannu district. The onset dates of paralysis are 18 and 22 May [2019] respectively, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases in 2019 to 24.
- Additionally, 1 WPV1-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, collected on 20 May [2019] from Quetta, Balochistan.

Nigeria
- 5 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) viruses were reported in the past week from environmental samples, collected in May [2019] from Kwara and Lagos states. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 remains 8.
- Recent confirmation of spread of the cVDPV2 outbreak, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2) response.

Lake Chad Basin
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) was reported in the past week.
- In the Lake Chad region, cVDPV2 linked to the outbreak originating in Nigeria has been detected in Niger (1 case in 2019 and 10 cases in 2018), and Cameroon (1 positive environmental sample, collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord).
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.

Central Africa
Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo)
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo). So far, 1 cVDPV case has been reported in DRC in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20. DRC is affected by 4 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga; Mongala; Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri and Kasai.

Angola
- A circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed in Angola. The virus was isolated from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [5 Apr 2019], from Lunda Norte province, bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo). DR Congo has been affected by known circulating VDPV2 (cVDPV2) outbreaks since early 2017 and has been conducting outbreak response with monovalent OPV type 2 (mOPV2).
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. A full epidemiological and virological field investigation is ongoing, including to ascertain the source and origin of the isolated virus; active surveillance is being strengthened; subnational population immunity levels are being analysed; and outbreak response is being planned.
- Given cross-border population movements, subnational immunity and surveillance gaps, Lunda Norte province is considered at high risk for further transmission of the isolated cVDPV2. It is critical that an emergency, preventive outbreak response now be fully implemented in the province. In absence of a timely and high-quality vaccination response, there is imminent risk of further transmission of this cVDPV2, potentially leading to a significant outbreak of paralytic polio. 2 preventive emergency outbreak response campaigns with mOPV2 are planned in Lunda Norte province, to be synchronized with campaigns in neighbouring areas of DR Congo, to interrupt any potential cross-border circulation.
- Separately, a 2nd VDPV2 was also isolated from a further AFP case 1st detected in Huila province, who subsequently travelled thereafter to Huambo province to seek care. Initial sequencing suggests it is unrelated to the VDPV2 isolated in Lunda Norte (or any other VDPV2 isolated elsewhere).
- This event further underlines the risk of cVDPV2 across Africa.

Horn of Africa
- A circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak in the Horn of Africa has been detected in Somali province, Ethiopia. The virus was isolated from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case with onset of paralysis on 20 May 2019.
- Genetic sequencing confirms that the isolated virus is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak detected in the Horn of Africa in 2018, with cases reported in Somalia as well as from an environmental sample in Kenya. Separately, Somalia is also affected by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) outbreak.
- Somalia has reported a total of 15 cVDPV cases (8 type 2, 6 type 3 and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018]. Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Since detection of the cVDPVs in the Horn of Africa in 2018, Ethiopia had declared the outbreaks -- together with the Ministries of Health of Kenya and Somalia -- to be a regional public health emergency and has been participating in regional outbreak response.
- Given cross-border population movements across the Horn of Africa and subnational immunity and surveillance gaps, Somali province is considered at high risk of further transmission of this isolated cVDPV2.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. A full epidemiological and virological field investigation is ongoing; active surveillance is being strengthened; subnational population immunity levels are being analysed; and outbreak response is being planned.
- This event further underlines the risk of cVDPV2 across the Horn of Africa.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- A GPEI [Global Polio Eradication Initiative] Outbreak Response Assessment reviewed the impact of current outbreak response and concluded that overall strong response had been implemented. Commending national and subnational public health authorities and health workers on their efforts, the Assessment team underscored the need on now filling any residual subnational surveillance and immunity gaps.
- The team reviewed all aspects of the response, and noted significant efforts and improvements, including on service delivery, surveillance strengthening, data analysis, cold chain/reverse cold chain refurbishment, vaccine acceptance and community engagement, health worker engagement, collaboration with neighbouring Indonesia and outreach to remote areas/communities. In particular, the group noted the strong collaboration between outbreak response and strengthening of routine immunization, including through systematic collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and highlighted that this model of working should be replicated in other outbreak settings.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 1.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.

Iran
- 1 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1)-positive environmental sample was reported in the past week, from Sistan and Balochistan province, collected on 20 May 2019.
- In total, 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported in 2019, all from Sistan and Balochistan province. The isolated viruses have been detected in environmental samples only, and genetic sequencing confirms they are linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

[If one looks at the report above, one sees we are now up to 14 countries that have reported polio isolates in the past 12 months either from individuals with AFP (acute flaccid paralysis), asymptomatic contacts of AFP cases, or "just" environmental samples. A 15th country had reported a poliovirus type 2 isolate a short while back -- Central African Republic -- but further information on that isolate has not been available.

There are now 3 countries that have recently confirmed WPV1 isolates -- Afghanistan and Pakistan continue to have cases (and in addition to the 2 cases in Pakistan we reported from a media report yesterday, 20 Jun 2019, a 3rd case was reported in a media report plus on the End Polio Pakistan website today, 21 Jun 2019). Iran has reported a 3rd isolate, again in Sistan and Balochistan province, again genetically related to WPV1 circulating in Sindh province, Pakistan and again just in an environmental sample. Hence, the WPV1 continues to circulate in Iran, luckily thus far not associated with AFP disease in any of the population in Iran.

As for the countries with cVDPVs, there appear to be 3 main exporters of cVDPVs in Africa -- Nigeria (from the Jigawa associated outbreak), Somalia, and the DR Congo (Democratic Republic of the Congo). Is this the polioviruses' last hurrah before transmission is interrupted? Or is this our future continually close to interruption of transmission and recurrent hiccups?

[2] Pakistan (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa): media report
Date: Fri 21 Jun 2019
Source: The News International (Pakistan) [edited]
https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/487692-three-more-children-diagnosed-with-polio-in-kp


Polio continued to hit children in the country as 3 more children were diagnosed with the virus on [Thu 20 Jun 2019]. All 3 polio cases were reported from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. And with the latest 3 cases, the total number of polio cases reached 27 in Pakistan in 2019.

Among the 3 children, a 21-month-old girl, resident of Saidgai village, Takhti Khel Union Council [Bannu district], was diagnosed with polio. She reportedly didn't get any polio vaccine. The child belongs to a poor family and her father is stated to be a driver.

The 2nd polio case was reported from remote mountainous Torghar district, [in] a 10-month-old boy, resident of Gigani, Hernail union council of Judbah subdivision. This child is also stated to have received no dose.

The 3rd polio case was reported from Lakki Marwat [in] a 15-month-old boy, resident of Jadid Mamakhel, Mamakhel union council of Sarae Naurang subdivision. According to the officials, the child belongs to a poor family and his father is a labourer. The area borders the Ghoriwala Union Council of the Bannu district that has become a headache for the government in terms of growing polio cases and challenges on ground.

Out of 27 cases in the country, Punjab and Sindh reported 3 each polio cases and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has reported 13 [14?] cases so far. In KP, Bannu is on top with 9 cases, followed by North Waziristan [in KPTD] with 5 cases, while Lakki Marwat, Torghar, Hangu, Dera Ismail Khan, Shangla, and Khyber reported 1 polio case each this year [2019].

[This media report and the End Polio Pakistan website (see http://www.endpolio.com.pk/polioin-pakistan/polio-cases-district-wise-2019) mention 3 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (20 Jun 2019). I suspect the case from Torghar district had not been released prior to the publication of the cases from Bannu and Lakki Marwat. It does explain the media report in yesterday's (20 Jun 2019) update dealing with results of a Jirga (tribal council) supporting the polio vaccination activities in Torghar. The addition of these cases brings the number of confirmed cases of WPV1 associated paralytic polio in Pakistan this year (2019) to date to 27, and including yesterday's report of another case in Afghanistan, the global total of WPV1 associated cases to 36, surpassing 2018's full year total of 33 cases.

According to the End Polio Pakistan website, the case distribution is:
Punjab
-------
Lahore / 3

Sindh
------
Karachi / 3
Larkana

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa
--------
Bannu / 9
Hangu / 1
DI Khan / 1
Shangla / 1
Torghar / 1
Lakki Marwat / 1

KPTD (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal Districts)
--------
Bajour / 1
Khyber / 1
Miran Shah / 2
Mir Ali / 3

While there have been the occasional positive environmental sample from Balochistan, to date there have not been any cases of AFP associated with WPV1 in Balochistan since 1 Jan 2019.
