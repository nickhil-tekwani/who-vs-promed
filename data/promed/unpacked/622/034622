_Ehrlichia canis_, Australia
----------------------------
Information received on [and dated] Fri 5 Jun 2020 from Dr. Mark Schipp, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, Australian Government, Canberra, Australia

Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Start date: 13 May 2020
Date of confirmation of the event: 30 May 2020
Reason for notification: Emerging disease
Morbidity: 75%
Mortality: 12.5%
Zoonotic impact: Transmissible to humans through tick bites
Causal agent: _Ehrlichia canis_
Serotype: Pending

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Kununurra, Western Australia
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 May 2020
Outbreak status: Continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: Village
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Dogs / 8 / 6 / 1 / - / -
Affected population: Domestic household dogs.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Dogs / 75 / 12.5 / 16.67 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
**Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreaks(s): Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Government agencies in Australia will undertake further surveillance for _Ehrlichia canis_ in the dog population in northern Australia. This information will inform Australia's response policy, which will be outlined in follow-up reports. Australia notes that _E. canis_ is not an OIE-listed disease. However, due to the pathogen's importance as a trade-related and zoonotic disease, and in the spirit of transparency, Australia has submitted this OIE notification.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; traceability; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; control of vectors; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); treatment of affected animals (Affected dogs were sampled and treated by a private veterinarian in Kununurra. Dogs have been administered tick treatment and are on antibiotic treatment.)
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Dogs / Gene sequencing / - / Pending
Dogs / Indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test / 30 May 2020 / Positive
Dogs / Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 30 May 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne disease of dogs caused by infection with the bacteria _Ehrlichia canis_. _E. canis_ occurs worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions.

_E. canis_ was detected in a small number of domesticated dogs in the Halls Creek and Kununurra area in May 2020. This is the 1st detection of _E. canis_ in Australia.

The Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development (DPIRD) is liaising with the owners of the dogs and their private veterinarian and will be conducting further surveillance to determine the distribution of the disease.

Infection with _E. canis_ (ehrlichiosis) is a notifiable disease in Australia.

Dogs become infected with E. canis after being bitten by an infected tick. _E. canis_ is transmitted primarily by the brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_), which is widely distributed worldwide and is present in Australia.

Dogs do not transmit the disease to each other. The disease is maintained by a cycle of transmission between ticks and dogs.

While infected dogs do not transmit ehrlichiosis to people, in rare cases, infected ticks may transmit _E. canis_ to people.

While surveillance is being carried out to determine the distribution of _E. canis_, conditions for dog movements out of the Kimberley region have been put in place to reduce the spread of the disease.

These movement conditions have been implemented under the Exotic Diseases of Animals Act 1993 Control Order No. 1/2020, and apply to the shires of Broome, Derby-West Kimberley, Halls Creek, and Wyndham-East Kimberley.

The above information was extracted from the page on Ehrlichiosis in dogs, Department of Primary Industries and Regional Development, Government of Western Australia, available at https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/ehrlichiosis (last updated 4 Jun 2020).

Australia is to be commended for reporting this event to inform the world, particularly since the disease is not on the OIE list of reportable diseases. - Mod.CRD
