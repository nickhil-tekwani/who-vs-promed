Soldiers battle rat disease
----------------------------
14 soldiers in north Queensland have been taken to a military
hospital with a potentially fatal infection possibly from a disease
carried by rats. The group fell ill while involved in a regular
military exercise in Innisfail earlier this week.
The 14 soldiers are currently in the hospital at Lavarack Barracks,
at Townsville, suspected to be infected with leptospirosis. An army
spokesman said blood tests were being carried out to determine the
exact cause of the illness.
Leptospirosis is a bacterial disease that can damage the liver, lungs
and kidney, and may be fatal in some cases. It spreads through soil
and water contaminated with the urine of infected animals,
particularly rodents, and enters the human body through cuts.

activities in wet environments. The following 6 references
illustrate outbreaks of the infection in military personnel around
the world:

[Leptospirosis was first reported in Queensland Australia in 1934.
According to the Australian Cummunicable Diseases Intelligence (CDI)
1999 report (see ref below), there are an average of 50 to 120
reports of leptospirosis in Queensland per year. In the period Jan
through May of 1998 there were 153 cases reported from Queensland of
which 80 percent came from the far north of the state.
Epidemiological investigations showed that the banana (agriculture),
meatworker and farming industries accounted for over 30 percent of
the reported cases. 75 percent of the cases were in 20-49 year old
individuals, with school aged children (5-16 percent) representing 5
percent of the reported cases. Serovars identified during this
period (with percent of total in parentheses) were: positive cultures
- unknown (26.5), zanoni (20.0), hardjo (16.1), australis (10.3),
szwajizak (6.5), pomona (5.9), kremastos (3.2), canicola (3.2),
robinsoni (1.9), tarassovi (1.3), grippotyphosa (1.3), celledoni
(1.3), ballum (1.3), medanensis (0.6), bulgarica (0.6).
