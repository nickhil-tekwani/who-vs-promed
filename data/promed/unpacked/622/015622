Yellow rust detected in Essex
-----------------------------
Richard Peake, of Harlow Agricultural Merchants, has reported his 1st
sightings of yellow rust this [2010/11] season: "Yellow rust will be a
threat [in 2011]. Most growers have continued predominantly with
[varieties] which are yellow rust susceptible.

"There is also possibly a new race of rust to consider, the Claire
race. This race started up in New Zealand and has since been
identified in UK breeding programmes -- if it takes a hold, almost all
of the UK wheat area will be susceptible to infection.

"In our trials, varietal responses to fungicide programmes over
untreated ranged from 100 percent to 20 percent [yield response], so
there is no question about return on investment from these inputs."

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale,
and a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind dispersed in several
cycles during the cropping season, and the fungus survives on living
host plants generating a "green bridge" between seasons. Disease
management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide
applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging
worldwide. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been
established in different wheat growing regions. The Claire strain
first appeared in New Zealand in 2006 on wheat cultivar Claire which
had been released in 1999 with complete resistance to stripe rust. In
the past, many stripe rust strains have appeared in the UK and then
spread eastwards (see link below), therefore the Claire strain may
also pose a risk to other European countries.
