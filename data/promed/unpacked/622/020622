Wild migratory birds may suffer from avian influenza (commonly known
as bird flu), but they are not the main source of the disease's
outbreak in Pakistan, according to a study statement issued by the
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Lahore chapter on Friday [15 Feb 2008].

The statement said that the statements about migratory birds being
the main reason for the latest outbreak of bird flu in Pakistani
poultry farms might have serious repercussions against the birds and
their habitats. It said since the recent outbreak of bird flu in
Sindh, WWF Pakistan had been in contact with BirdLife International,
which carried out research on the role of wild birds, including
migratory species, in the spread of HPAI H5N1.

The WWF said there were no sound grounds to support the allegations
that migratory birds were solely responsible for the spread of H5N1.
It said the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) collected samples
from between 300 000 to 350 000 wild birds across the world. None of
these were found H5N1 positive. Likewise, a sampling of 5000 water
birds after the outbreak in Nigeria during 2006 found no traces of
the virus (according to the Wildlife and the Environment Web).
Despite increased sampling around the world, no fully documented
migratory wild birds have tested positive for H5N1.

The WWF said the mapping of bird flu outbreaks across the world had
shown that they followed poultry trade routes rather than the
migratory birds' flyways. Therefore, after a comprehensive critical
review of recent scientific literature, it was concluded that poultry
trade, rather than bird migration, was the main mechanism of the
global dispersal of the H5N1 virus.

The organisation said the illegal trade of caged birds had
transported the H5N1 virus the world over. It said: "Bird flu virus
is transmitted farm to farm by the movement of live birds, people
(especially with contaminated clothes), and contaminated vehicles,
equipment, feed, and cages. Highly pathogenic viruses can survive for
long periods in the environment, especially when temperatures are
low. For example, the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus can survive in
bird feces for at least 35 days at a low temperature (4 C). At a much
higher temperature (37 C), H5N1 viruses have been shown to survive in
fecal samples for 6 days (WHO)."

The WWF called for the media to educate the people about the bird flu
virus and how it was being spread. It also called for the authorities
to monitor any suspicious mortality of birds in the wild. It asked
the zoos to vaccinate all birds against the virus. The organisation
said poultry farms should have tracking numbers, because once their
birds got out in the market, they could not be tracked back to the
farms. The WWF said strict hygiene and bio-security measures should
be taken at poultry farms and zoos. People and vehicles going to the
farms should be disinfected; the birds' caretakers should
meticulously clean utensils, their hands and feet.

The statement said the organisation did not support mass culling of
wild birds or the destruction of their habitats. It said the birds'
habitats should be left undisturbed so that they do not seek refuge
near human settlements.

[The good news is that the initial concern that the global spread of
H5N1 was dependent on and a result of migratory birds has proven to
be a false alarm -- now that thousands of such have been sampled over
the past few years -- and it is now clear that any H5N1-infected wild
birds were infected essentially incidentally.

There was no global biological conspiracy of that virus in nature,
though the events are not without interest within the greater
epidemiology of avian influenza viruses. This is not to say that it
cannot go from wild birds to domestic birds, but that is the
exception, not the rule.

The bad news is that H5N1 seems to be well embedded in the commercial
and domestic poultry in various parts of the world and will probably
remain so for some time to come. There are a total of 79 postings on
