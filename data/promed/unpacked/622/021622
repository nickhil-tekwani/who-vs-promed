A case of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been confirmed in a 54-year-old man in North West, the provincial health department said. It said [CP] was in a stable condition, conscious, communicating and responding well to treatment at the Klerksdorp Tshepong hospital complex.

"[CP] from a farm between Ventersdorp and Coligny in the North West province was admitted in the Klerksorp Hospital HID (highly infectious disease) unit with the history of Crimean-Congo fever at 16:45," hospital CEO Polaki Mokatsane said.

The statement said [CP] had visited a neighbouring farm on [26 Apr 2019] and later found a tick on his head, which he crushed with his fingers. Two days later, he experienced headache that recurred continuously despite taking painkillers.

He saw some redness on his skin on [30 Apr 2019] and consulted a private hospital in Potchefstroom, where he was admitted and discharged on [1 May 2019] after blood tests were done.

Later the same day [CP] was recalled to the hospital, as his blood levels were said to be low. He was admitted and transferred to the ICU isolation unit in the same facility on [3 May 2019].

The National Institute for Communicable Diseases confirmed he had CCHF, a viral disease with symptoms that may include fever, muscle pains, headache, vomiting, diarrhoea and bleeding into the skin.

[CP] was transferred to the North West provincial HID unit at Klerksdorp Hospital.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) cases occur sporadically in South Africa, with a yearly average of 5. CCHF virus is typically transmitted by the so-called "bontpoot" ticks, 3 species of _Hyalomma_ ticks (_Hyalomma rufipes_, _ Hyalomma glabrum_, and _ Hyalomma truncatum_). There are 3 species of _Hyalomma_ in South Africa, and although they are widely distributed, the ticks tend to be most numerous in the drier northwestern parts of the country -- the Karoo, western Free State, Northern Cape and North West Province (http://www.nicd.ac.za/assets/files/CCHF_FAQ-General_Public.pdf).

Human CCHF cases have been reported annually from South Africa since 1981, when it was 1st recognized in the country; between 0 and 20 cases of CCHF are diagnosed each year. Through nearly 30 years of passive surveillance, a total of 187 cases has been laboratory-confirmed. Although cases have been reported from all of the 9 provinces in the past 30 years, more than half of the cases originate from the semi-arid areas of Northern Cape Province (31.5% of cases) and Free State Province (23% of cases) (http://www.nicd.ac.za/assets/files/CCHF_FAQ-General_Public.pdf).

Occupational groups such as herders, farmers, abattoir workers, veterinarians/animal health workers, hunters and persons informally slaughtering domestic/wild animals are at higher risk of infection. These persons often have exposure to ticks on the animals and in the animal environment, and also often have exposure to animal blood/tissues (e.g., during castration of calves, vaccination, notching/tagging of ears, slaughtering).

Humans can become infected in the following ways:
- Being bitten by infected ticks.
- Squashing infected ticks (if fluid from the ticks enters into cuts/grazes on the skin, or splashes onto mucous membranes, including the eyes, nose and mouth).
- If blood/tissue from infected animals (during the short period that the animals have virus in circulation) comes into contact with cuts/grazes on the skin, or splashes onto mucous membranes, including the eyes, nose and mouth.
- Needle-stick/sharps injuries in healthcare workers from infected patients.

People are not always aware of being bitten by ticks, and in patients with CCHF, ticks have been found attached in concealed sites, such as on the scalp and between the toes.

The patient in the above report had possible exposure to an infected tick that he crushed, followed by development of symptoms. - Mod.UBA
