*********

[Since the start of the FMD serotype O epizootic in Bulgaria, in
January 2011, the source of infection was sought. Bulgaria is regarded
as a country free of FMD without vaccination; the last case was
reported in October 1996. The 1st new case was confirmed on 4 Jan 2011
in a wild boar shot in Burgas, near the Turkish border. The source of
infection was suspected by the Bulgarian authorities to be within
Turkish Thrace.

Turkish Thrace is recognised by the OIE as an "FMD free zone with
vaccination" since May 2010; the recognition was given following the
submission, by Turkey, of evidence of freedom, based upon surveillance
activities, the maintenance of strict control upon animal movements
between Thrace and other parts of Turkey (known to be heavily
infected), upon imports, and the methodical performance of periodic
mass vaccinations of large and small ruminants. No case of FMD has
been reported from Thrace since 2007.

On 2 May 2011, EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal
Health (SCFCAH) held its periodic meeting in Brussels, during which
the Bulgarian delegation presented a report on the evolving epizootic.
Slide 12 included a map which showed 3 locations in Turkish Thrace,
adjacent to the Bulgarian border, where wild boars were said to have
been found seropositive for FMD in 2010. See the report at
http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/02052011_fmd__bulgaria.pdf.

The above information, not available in earlier SCFCAH presentations
nor in OIE reports, was published in ProMED-mail's posting 20110505.1394, accompanied by a request for confirmation and for
additional, current data. Additional information has now come to our
attention, indicative of recent positive findings in Thrace's wild
boars. The information is derived from the reports of 3 meetings which
had been held during 2011:

1. The 81st Session of the Executive Committee of the European
Commission for the Control of Foot-and-Mouth Disease (EuFMD) Budapest,
Hungary, 2 Feb 2011
(http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/commissions/en/eufmd/execom_81report_txt.html);

2. A regional tripartite (Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey) meeting, Plovdip,
Bulgaria, 25 Mar 2011
(http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo//commissions/en/eufmd/report_regional.html);

3. A joint meeting of the EuFMD Research group and FAO EMPRES
Wildlife Unit, Berlin, 11-12 Apr 2011
(http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo//commissions/docs/Workshop/Workshop_berlin_2011/report.pdf).

EuFMD Research group/FAO EMPRES Wildlife Unit Joint Meeting on the
risks of persistence of FMD circulation in wild boar/wildlife in
South-East Bulgaria and Turkish Thrace. Berlin, 11-12 Apr 2011
--------------------------------------

Background to meeting:
----------------------
The meeting was organised by the EuFMD Commission, in collaboration
with FAO and with the support of the EC (via MTF/INT/003/EEC) in
response to the unprecedented situation in south-east Europe, where
wild boar (WB) had been confirmed positive in January [2011] for FMDV,
and were considered to be a plausible source of infection for several
of the following outbreaks in Bulgaria.

The purpose of the meeting was to identify gaps in knowledge, and
priorities for follow-up actions, in order to improve guidance to
countries on surveillance for infection (or its absence). It was also
a valuable opportunity to review the findings of FMD surveillance in
domestic and wildlife species in the 2 countries, to review findings
from FMD experiment studies in wild boar, and to identify the
likelihood of persistence of virus circulation in the wildlife in this
region.

The 19 participants were from the 2 current affected countries, with
experts from Germany, UK, Belgium, FAO, and EC.

Part I: Background
------------------
In the recent Tripartite meeting (Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey) in
Bulgaria, the Turkish participants, following-up from the EuFMD
mission in January 2011, had reported the results of surveillance in
wild boar and revealed that 5 out of 26 animals were positive for FMD
antibody. The meeting was called with the purpose of identifying gaps
in knowledge on the transmission of FMD by wild boar and wildlife that
would affect the estimation of the epidemic duration in wildlife in
this region, or indeed in other parts of Europe.

The meeting opened with a review of the literature on FMD in wild
boar in Eurasia, given by S. Khomenko (FAO). [He noted] that there are
many references in old publications (mainly pre-WWII and in Russian)
but few from western Europe in the same period, [up to recent times],
only publications from Israel.

Since FMD in western Europe became rare after 1970, as a result of
mass vaccination, and WB populations have increased in the period, the
risks associated with WB may need to be revised in light of recent
findings and population increase/expansion. He placed the recent
findings from Bulgaria and Turkey in the context of known and
estimated WB populations in the Strandzha ecosystem, a forested region
straddling the Turkish/Bulgarian border; this region is an extensive
area with limited domestic animals within the forest; recent cases in
Bulgaria are on the more western edges, where forest gives way to more
populated valleys with denser and more continuous domestic animal
[populations].

The virological (full genome sequence) findings do suggest entry of
infection into animals in this region, expansion of the infection and
spillover as separate secondary infections into domestic animals. The
serological evidence from WB in Turkey supports the view that part of
this reservoir has been in wildlife. The duration [of] infection
[which] has been present in this ecosystem must be at least 4 months;
the likely continuation is the subject of the meeting. [See also item
2].

Part II Current situation: surveillance findings
------------------------------------------------
The talks from Bulgaria reviewed the epidemiological findings and the
laboratory assessment including sequencing studies conducted to shed
light on transmission events and connection between outbreaks. With
the exception of the 1st, index case (confirmed 4 Jan 2011), no FMD
antibody or virus positive wild boar or [other wildlife] had been
found.

FMDV from the initial index case in WB, plus the domestic animal
cases in Kosti and Resovo villages (1st wave, in the east) and Kirovo
(2nd, wave in the west) were genetically distinct, suggesting no
direct connection between any of these cases. Instead, FMDV had
evolved from a common ancestor, presumably within unknown (wild?)
animals in this area. Since the area is highly forested and all
domestic animals subject to serological surveillance (within
protection zones and surveyed in surveillance and at risk zones), then
in this area, the reservoir is likely to be wildlife, which almost
[numerically] equal domestic animals in this area.

The talk from Turkey focused on surveillance in wild boar and the
evidence for absence of circulation in domestic animals in Thrace.
Hunting was banned after the index case in Bulgaria, except for
surveillance; a plan had been developed by the EuFMD mission team
working with Turkish authorities, and 26 animals had been shot for
surveillance from 3 priority forested areas of Thrace. Five of 11
animals from the Strandzha ecosystem had tested NSP positive and had
type O antibody reactions, confirming past infection; all were virus
negative. However, animal ages and exact location data were missing
from most of these; nevertheless the locations were sufficiently far
apart to say that these were not from the same groups, and infection,
therefore, had been successful in reaching a significant fraction over
a dispersed area close to the Bulgarian border.

No substantially new results were presented in comparison to those
reported at the meeting in Plovdiv (Bulgaria) 2 weeks previously [25
Mar 2011; see further]. This was, however, a very good opportunity to
share knowledge with experts from Germany, Italy, Belgium and the UK,
all of whom were new to the situation.

Part III Conditions for persistence
-----------------------------------
Subsequent presentations were made on the potential for persistence
for FMD in wild boar wildlife by Vittorio Guberti (VG) (FAO),
Stephanie Kramer-Schadt (SKS) and Hans Thulke (HT) from Germany. The
latter 2 presented some preliminary work on modelling, adapting the
models for CSF to FMD in which they looked at parameters that might
result in an extended epidemic, as well as the findings for the
conventional model. The results of the modelling suggested an epidemic
would last between one to 2 years with little likelihood of
persistence beyond 2 years according to their model assumptions. This
model was based largely on a block of country which would approximate
to the Strandzha eco-system.

The implication that an epidemic could persist for many months,
possibly to 2 years, is new and of high importance; the current
evidence, although limited, does suggest the epidemic has been
successful in wild boar in Turkey (the locations of positive boar were
distant) and suggests that they could be right. They could find only
very rare circumstances for an extended epidemic; the duration depends
largely on the size of the population and other parameters such as the
presence or absence of maternal immunity, the latter affecting the
role of piglets in amplification of infection in the population. This
model did not take into account possible antigenic drift, which is a
very big difference between CSF and FMD.

Part IV Infection dynamics and transmission in wild boar/wildlife; in
vivo findings
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Angele Breithaupt of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute (FLI) presented
the findings of an experiment with the Bulgarian strain in wild boar.
This showed there was a longer incubation period and also a higher
level of virus excretion by a wild boar than domestic pigs.
Subsequently, a presentation was given by Ryan Waters (RW) from
Pirbright (Institute for Animal Health - IAH) on the possible role of
infection in pregnancy and neonatal animals in which the potential
exists for abortion and delayed expulsion of infected material into
the environment, and also death in neonates; these factors have not
yet been taken into consideration in the modelling study but could
extend the period of infectiousness of an animal group or their
environment. The role of other wildlife was briefly discussed as well,
but it was thought that if the model of Hans Thulke was correct, then
the role of short-lived infections in other wildlife might be not
really any different from wild boar, but, given their lower
reproductive (breeding) rate, this might limit their role in the
epidemic.

Relating to field sampling of wild animals, FLI requested that they
receive serum samples from wild boar to compare for levels to those in
experimental infection; IAH (Pirbright) was to receive tissue samples
for virus propagation and full genome sequencing (subject to funds).

Regarding other species, experimental infections would be difficult
and need greater evidence of an issue (e.g. findings of exposure in
the field) and possibly implication of importance from modelling
studies (the multi-species models) before experiments justified.

The implications of these findings were then worked upon by 4
groups.

The main conclusions and recommendations were:

1. more work is needed to establish the models and to test the
reality of an extended epidemic occurring in wild boar populations and
this model development would not only take into account those factors
which have been mentioned, but would also need to have their
assumptions checked by a wider group of experts;

2. the opportunity to validate these models with in depth field
studies on exposure of different species to FMD must be taken;

3. immediate (summer period) surveillance in wildlife in the
Strandzha ecosystem is needed in both Bulgaria and in neighbouring
parts of Turkey to give a rapid assessment (snapshot) of the current
exposure/distribution of infection in areas posing a threat for
domestic animal exposure;

4. surveillance plans for the autumn/winter period must be developed,
considering the probable duration of the epidemic;

5. further experimental studies (domestic or wild boar) should be
designed and costed, focusing on the transmission parameters that most
affect estimated duration of an epidemic.

Of immediate importance would be the planned surveillance in
Bulgaria, and their representatives agreed that they would review
their surveillance plan in light of the new findings. On the Turkish
side, [a plan will be developed] for emergency surveillance during the
summer months involving hunting wild boar on the edges of the forests
where they invade the crop land. This would, therefore, also inform
regarding the risk from wild animals to domestic at the interface and
could provide some valuable information on the extent to which the
epidemic has spread to the south. Since the epidemic was expected to
last in the ecosystem for longer than 6 months, then studies in the
autumn during the normal hunting season would be planned in both
countries, and autumn would be the time for the other extended study
to take place in Turkey.

The other follow-up include experiments to be conducted; perhaps the
principal ones of concern would be how long the immunity is in wild
boar, because if it were short, they would re-enter the
epidemiological cycle, and also on the possibility of using lymph
nodes as an "archive material" possibly indicating the timing of the
initial infection of the animals, which could be very valuable in
trying to establish the sequence of events and whether infection in a
population is old or recent from hunted samples. This would require an
experimental study over some months, and there is a possibility of the
FLI, IAH and SAP Institute (Turkey) collaborating to make a
cost-effective study. These reports and proposals will be costed, and
funding will be sought, possibly from the EU after the General Session
of the EuFMD Commission in April 2011.

Conclusions:
------------
1. The lack of reports on the role of wild boar/wildlife in
maintaining FMD in western Europe in the past should not be considered
conclusive on their future role, given the number of historic reports
from Eastern Europe and the increase in population densities and
distributions in Europe in the past 10 years;
2. The data from Bulgaria and adjacent [parts of] Turkey is currently
insufficient to draw conclusions on the relative role of wildlife and
domestic animal infections in maintaining the epidemic since its
introduction in late 2010;
3. The genome sequencing , which suggests amplification and evolution
of the strain from a common ancestor in late 2010, and the finding of
sero-positive WB in Demirkoy district of Thrace [Turkey], together
with the index case in a WB in Bulgaria, suggest wildlife have been
affected and may have been a significant part of the series of
transmissions that led to genetically distinct FMDV affecting the
domestic animals in the 1st and 2nd waves of domestic animal outbreaks
in Bulgaria;
4. Since all wild and domesticated ungulate species may play some
role in transmission, wild ungulates (principally 3 deer species in
the area) should also be sampled, and included in modeling;
5. Given the short period of excretion by ungulates, and low
reproduction rate, deer species are unlikely to change the duration of
persistence in a population;
6. Based on the assumptions used, including the results of the
transmission experiment with the Bulgarian isolate, endemic infection
in a WB population would be unlikely to occur; however, as the
duration of an epidemic depends on size of the population, duration of
the endemic [infection] in a population and areas similar to the
Strandzha ecosystem could last between one and 2 years;
7. A longer duration would require the regular introduction of new
susceptible animals, which may occur through a high breeding rate,
contact with non-immune domestic stock, declining immunity after
recovery, and evolution of antigenic variants;
8. Key parameters that need experimental evidence or expert opinion
are the duration of maternal immunity (since it affects the role of
piglets in amplification cycles), rate of antigen drift and its impact
on transmission by partially immune animals; and the role of infection
in pregnancy or neonatal period upon mortality and virus survival in
discharges and carcasses (which could be a form of environmental
persistence);
9. Sero-surveillance, in all relevant species, should be adequate for
demonstrating presence of infection, and for data needed for model
development and validation;
10. Given the above, FMDV infection can be expected to persist
through 2011 in the ecosystem, with risk to domestic animals
principally at the forest edges and within the forest;
11. Hunting for surveillance at the forest edges is a possible option
in Turkey for summer period surveillance; the results, and risk
features at the forest/domestic interface, may be useful to design
local control measures to protect the status of domestic animals in
Thrace region;
12. Surveillance in Bulgaria should be designed and implemented to
provide results within a useful period for risk assessment; given the
expected duration of the epidemic, repeated rounds of surveillance
should be anticipated;

Recommendations:
----------------
1. Sampling wild boar for FMD exposure; serum, tonsil, lymph nodes
draining sites of replication (submandibular, pre-scapular) should be
taken from all sampled animals; if NSP positive, go back to these
samples for virus/genome detection/sequence analysis.
2. Further development of the models to include parameters such as
antigenic drift, multi-species and domestic/wildlife infection
exchange is needed.
3. The current opportunity to validate models with field data from
Strandzha and from Anatolia should be taken, with well structured
surveillance designs; these studies would be likely to be possible
[during the] autumn/winter hunting season 2011.
4. Animal experts are needed to optimize information from the
sampling and diagnostic protocols; a longitudinal study of infection
in domestic and wild boar with weekly sampling over a year to
determine antibody decay and presence of viral RNA in lymph nodes.
5. Maternal antibodies and protection; review of the literature
needed.

[Subscribers may find particular interest in presentation 8, Wild
boar and FMD: issues and study opportunities by Sergei Khomenko, also
briefly covered in item 1. Special attention is due to the author's
reminder that "Wild boar is unique among other ungulates as the only
scavenging species(!)." The presentation includes also maps of WB
distribution in several countries. Iranian maps demonstrate the
possible linkage between WB density and FMD distribution.

In this context, subscribers may refer to archived posting 20070508.1480, "Foot & mouth disease, ovine fetuses," presenting a
Chinese paper on FMD in pregnant sheep, suggesting a possible
mechanism whereby subclinically infected pregnant sheep are in a state
to maintain infection for extended periods and disseminate the virus
through fetuses or placentas. If such mechanism is indeed confirmed in
the field, scavenging wild boars are to be seriously considered as an
intermediate link and a potential virus emitter. This is further
underlined by the results of the FLI experiment with the Bulgarian
strain in wild boar, which showed there was a longer incubation period
and also a higher level of virus excretion by a wild boar than
domestic pigs (which are known as prolific virus emitters on their own
account).

Hopefully, the recommendations for enhanced support of research and
field studies will be soon fulfilled. In this respect, EU's research
project "FMD-DISCONVAC" [Development, enhancement and complementation
of animal-sparing, foot and-mouth disease vaccine-based control
strategies for free and endemic regions], which started 1 Apr 2009 for
the duration of 39 months, deserves mentioning. This project included,
within its "Workpackage 6," titled "Improving knowledge on FMDV
transmission between species and in recently vaccinated animals,"
objective 5: "To study the role of gazelles and wild boars in FMDV
transmission under natural conditions." Workpackage 6 is led by CVI
(The Central Veterinary Institute, Netherlands). The other
participants are IIL (Indian Immunologicals Limited) and KVI (Kimron
Veterinary Institute, Israel). Further details are available at
http://fmddisconvac.net/workpackages/wp6. The results obtained, in
particular those related to wild boars and from the Middle East
(Israel), are awaited with interest.

The potential role of wild boars in FMD epidemiology has been the
subject of several ProMED posts in the past. This issue deserves
continued interest. - Mod.AS]
