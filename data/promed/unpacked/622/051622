The Ministry of Health wishes to advise that 4 more additional cases of chikungunya [virus infection] have been diagnosed in Anguilla and confirmed by the Public Health Agency (CARPHA) office located in Trinidad and Tobago. Chikungunya fever (CHIK) is a re-emerging, mosquito-borne disease caused by an alphavirus or chikungunya virus (CHIKV). The disease is transmitted predominantly by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, the same mosquito involved in the transmission of dengue fever on Anguilla.

The Ministry is urging anyone experiencing any signs and symptoms of chikungunya fever to see a doctor. Chikungunya fever is a viral disease transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. It is not transmitted via direct human to human contact. Chikungunya fever is basically characterized by sudden onset of high fever, severe pain in joints especially the wrists and ankles and muscular pain or tenderness which may persist for several months.

The Ministry of Health and Social Development continues to work in collaboration with the relevant agencies to ensure the appropriate preventative measures are implemented to reduce and contain the spread of the virus. The Department of Health Protection will commence island-wide fogging in the West End area this evening [11 Feb 2014].

The Ministry of Health and Social Development through this medium would like to re-emphasise the importance of taking the necessary precautionary measures to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes. Individuals should use insect repellent sprays/creams [preferably containing DEET], wear long sleeve shirts and pants or protective clothing when outdoors, use mosquito nets, and stay in areas with screens to avoid being bitten by infected mosquitoes. In addition, individuals, householders, businesses, and ports should strive to eliminate mosquito breeding sites from in and around their premises to reduce the proliferation of adult mosquitoes on their premises. They should make every effort to remove stagnant water, cover water storage containers, and ensure cisterns are screened to eliminate mosquito breeding and harbourage. These simple measures will go a long way in preventing mosquito bites and mosquito borne disease transmission.

The Ministry of Health and Social Development is advising all persons to stay tuned to media houses for further updates as we strive to keep you informed of the situation. Persons should contact the Permanent Secretary Health or Health Planner of the Ministry of Health and Social Development should they have any queries.

[The previous ProMED-mail report (archive no 20140207.2262952) indicated that there was one case of chikungunya fever in Anguilla island, probably imported from St Martin. Now, there are 4 additional locally acquired cases, indicating that chikungunya virus transmission is occurring on the island. Chikungunya virus continues its slow spread around the Caribbean Basin.

Anguilla island is a British overseas territory in the Caribbean and one of the most northerly of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles. The total land area of the island is 35 square miles (90 sq km), with a population of approximately 13 500 (2006 estimate). Maps showing the location of the island can be accessed at http://www.worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/namerica/caribb/ai.htm and http://healthmap.org/r/9NLv. - Mod.TY]
