Human infection caused by _Halicephalobus gingivalis_ is uncommon, but it is lethal when it occurs, because it leads to inflammation in the central nervous system. As officially reported, the Agroindustry Ministry in Buenos Aires Province decreed the interdiction (isolation) of 59 horses stabled in the Barracas al Sur Equestrian Club, in Avellaneda [Buenos Aires province], after the parasite was detected.

So far, 8 persons who had contact with the animals were assisted in Mu√±iz Hospital [in Buenos Aires], for control and follow-up.

Infection caused by _H. gingivalis_ is uncommon in humans. Only 5 cases of this condition have been reported in the world, and all of them fatal.

Brain infection by _H. gingivalis_ is common in horses. Other affected organs and systems include kidneys, oral and nasal mucosa, lymph nodes, lungs, spinal cord, and adrenal glands. The heart, liver, stomach, and bones may also be affected.

[_Halicephalobus gingivalis_ (previously _Micronema deletrix_) is a free-living nematode known to cause opportunistic infections, mainly in horses. It is a facultative parasite of horses and humans. Based on studies performed on infected horses in Florida, it can be inferred that the parasite is associated to swampland environments. The site of entry for the parasite is hypothesized to be through breaks in skin or through mucous membranes. They are distributed worldwide as cases of equine infections have been found in Canada, Florida, the Nordic regions, and Arabian horses alike.

_H. gingivalis_ is uncommon in humans so far. However, its rare effects are lethal as there is inflammation of the central nervous system, leading to brain dysfunction and meningoencephalomyelitis. This disease causes increased concentration of eosinophils in the cerebrospinal fluid. In horses (where the parasite is most studied), infection of the brain is common, followed by the kidneys, oral and nasal cavities, lymph nodes, lungs, spinal cord, and adrenal gland, and also reports of infection of heart, liver, stomach and bone. A rare triple fatality from _Halicephalobus_ was reported in the UK, where infected kidneys were transplanted to 2 recipients.

In humans the condition is rare, but in every case it has been fatal. All known cases of human infections were only found post mortem and had been fatal; they had not been treated with anthelminthic drugs (such as ivermectin and benzimidazole). In animals these drugs are mostly ineffective as they cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, an effective treatment in human and animals may not be known.
