In a follow up to a 4 Jul 2013 report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says 2 new human infections with influenza A (H3N2) variant (H3N2v) virus were reported to CDC during week 29, one in Indiana and one in Ohio. This brings the total cases this year [2013] to 14, with Indiana reporting 13 cases.

The CDC reports no hospitalizations or deaths have occurred. In addition, no ongoing human-to-human transmission has been identified, and all 14 cases have reported close contact with swine in the week prior to illness onset. CDC officials add: "Additional cases may be identified as the investigation continues." The Ohio Department of Health reminded its citizens to practice good hygiene when visiting livestock exhibits this summer [2013], in a recent new release.

"Individuals should always wash hands with soap and water before and after petting or touching any animal. Never eat, drink, or put anything in your mouth in animal areas. Parents and caregivers are encouraged to leave strollers outside the animal exhibits and carry small children. Older adults, pregnant women, young children, and people with weakened immune systems should consider avoiding animal areas," health officials said.

Type A influenza viruses, including H3N2 and H3N2v, commonly infect swine, causing outbreaks among swine herds. Most of the type A influenza viruses that infect swine are genetically very different from human (seasonal) influenza viruses. While these variant influenza viruses seldom infect humans, such infections can and do occur. In fact, influenza viruses can spread both from swine to humans and from humans to swine.

Out of the 2012 total of 309 H3N2v cases, Indiana and Ohio accounted for the bulk of the cases with 138 (45 percent) and 107 (35 percent) cases, respectively.

[It is clear that the A/H3N2v virus is still widespread in swine in the states of Indiana and to a lesser extent Ohio. However, the number of infections occurring as a consequence of visits to livestock fairs appears to have declined, indicating that previous warnings are being heeded. No instance of human-to-human transmission has been recorded so far. - Mod.CP
