Raul Anez, head of the Farm and Agriculture National Service SENASAG,
pointed to the low vaccination coverage as the main factor behind the 31
outbreaks of FMD virus in Cochabamba, central Bolivia, where restrictions
of movements have already been applied. He reported that only 40% of the
regional herd had been vaccinated, [compared with 80% at national level.
La Paz, Potosi, and Oruro in the Altiplano region, [where the disease was
previously unknown, have started to report some cases.
The vaccine costs 30 US cents to the livestock farmers, and suppliers in
Santa Cruz have more than a million doses, Dr Anez said. The last year a
total of 3.7 million cows, sheep, and pigs were vaccinated against foot and
mouth virus.
A total of 94 outbreaks have been detected this year all over the country,
in Cochabamba, Beni (13 outbreaks), Potosi, Oruro, Tarija, and in Santa
Cruz, where most of the stock is bred, 24 outbreaks have been registered,
one still active.

[Checking the Bolivia FMD statistics on the OIE website, I find nothing for
2000 or 2001, but prior to that Bolivia had some 20-33 outbreaks each year.
