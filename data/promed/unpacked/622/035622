More than 250 people have been struck down by a virulent form of foodborne illness that has been linked to lettuce grown in the UK. The cases occurred across the country through August to October 2022, however the full details have only just been made public by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). An investigation has been launched by the FSA, its counterpart in Scotland, and the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA).

FSA chief executive Emily Miles told board members Wednesday [7 Dec 2022] that this outbreak of foodborne illness linked to _E. coli_ STEC (Shiga toxin-producing _E.coli_ [or enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ EHEC]) is the largest since whole-genome sequencing of such bacteria began in 2014. She said: "To date, there have been a total of 259 confirmed cases identified in the UK with sample dates ranging between 23 Aug 2022 and 29 Oct 2022. Investigations suggest UK-produced lettuce and salad leaves could have been implicated, but it is too early to be certain that they were the source of illness. The ongoing supply chain investigation is extensive and complex, and we continue to look for the root cause and where in the supply chain the food safety risk occurred."

The problem with bugs on foods such as lettuce is that there is no cooking process to kill them. Dr Lesley Larkin, head of surveillance, gastrointestinal infections, and food safety at UKHSA, said: "Making sure you wash your hands with soap and water is the best way to stop this bug from spreading. When preparing food, make sure you thoroughly wash salad, fruit, and vegetables and follow all the safe cooking instructions for meat."

There have been no deaths or reported cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome linked to the latest outbreak.

[The serotype of EHEC is not stated here.

Although washing produce that is to be consumed without cooking, such as salad components, is advisable, it is not necessarily the case that contaminating human enteric pathogens are all removed. As demonstrated in the following publication, _E. coli_ O157 can be internalized into the plant per se. How often this occurs in natural settings is unclear.

Abstract
--------
"Numerous field studies have revealed that irrigation water can contaminate the surface of plants; however, the occurrence of pathogen internalization is unclear. This study was conducted to determine the sites of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 contamination and its survival when the bacteria were applied through spray irrigation water to either field-grown spinach or lettuce. To differentiate internalized and surface populations, leaves were treated with a surface disinfectant wash before the tissue was ground for analysis of _E. coli_ O157:H7 by direct plate count or enrichment culture. Irrigation water containing _E. coli_ O157:H7 at 10(2), 10(4), or 10(6) CFU/ml was applied to spinach 48 and 69 days after transplantation of seedlings into fields. _E. coli_ O157:H7 was initially detected after application on the surface of plants dosed at 10(4) CFU/ml (4 of 20 samples) and both on the surface (17 of 20 samples) and internally (5 of 20 samples) of plants dosed at 10(6) CFU/ml. Seven days postspraying, all spinach leaves tested negative for surface or internal contamination. In a subsequent study, irrigation water containing _E. coli_ O157:H7 at 10(8) CFU/ml was sprayed onto either the abaxial (lower) or adaxial (upper) side of leaves of field-grown lettuce under sunny or shaded conditions. _E. coli_ O157:H7 was detectable on the leaf surface 27 days postspraying, but survival was higher on leaves sprayed on the abaxial side than on leaves sprayed on the adaxial side. Internalization of _E. coli_ O157:H7 into lettuce leaves also occurred with greater persistence in leaves sprayed on the abaxial side (up to 14 days) than in leaves sprayed on the adaxial side (2 days)."
