Angola: Marburg death toll reaches 235
--------------------------------------
The death toll from the Marburg virus epidemic rose to 235 in Angola on Sun
17 Apr 2005, with some 500 people under surveillance after coming in
contact with the virus, the Health Ministry and the World Health
Organization (WHO) said.
Health officials are treating a total of 257 cases of [Marburg virus
infection], which has claimed 219 lives in the northern province of Uige,
the epicenter of the outbreak that was 1st detected in October [2004],
according to a statement from the Ministry and WHO. An additional 513
people are under surveillance, it added.
WHO experts said last week [3rd week April 2005] that there was no end in
sight for the epidemic, the worst outbreak ever of the virus, 1st detected
in 1967 when German laboratory workers in Marburg were infected by monkeys
from Uganda. The Marburg virus can kill a healthy person in a week by
diarrhea and vomiting followed by severe internal bleeding and is not
treatable with any known drugs.

Angola: The heroes of Uige
--------------------------
The town of Uige, Angola is witnessing an outbreak of Marburg virus
infection, one of the most deadly contagions known to humans. The incurable
Ebola-like disease causes fever, headache, nausea, and profuse bleeding.
Because it can be transmitted through contact with any bodily fluid, the
virus can spread quickly within a community. In Uige, more than 200 people
are thought to have died since the epidemic began earlier this year [2005].
This number would be far higher if not for the heroic efforts of local
health officials, as well as medical specialists from the World Health
Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and
the charity Medecins sans Frontieres.
Angola, a war-ravaged nation with a primitive health infrastructure, is not
an especially safe place to practise medicine under normal circumstances.
But with Marburg virus on the loose, the risks are extreme. Indeed, many of
the dead are health care workers who contracted the virus while caring for
victims at local hospitals. In some cases, terrified staff have fled, and
the doctors have had to mop and decontaminate their buildings themselves.
Making matters worse is the hostility of the local population. Since so
many of the victims who've been taken into hospitals by health care workers
have died, the town has been swept up by rumors that the masked doctors in
their midst are deliberately killing patients. During a recent tour of Uige
with a New York Times reporter, a Columbian doctor was forced to abandon
his rounds when a crowd of townspeople attacked a colleague's van with sticks.
2 of the heroes are Maria Bonino, an Italian doctor working with the
Italian aid group Doctors with Africa, and Matondo Alexandre, a UN child
protection expert based in Angola. Together, the pair raised the alarm over
Marburg earlier this year [2005], broadcasting their warnings over the
radio in February, when the government wasn't yet taking the outbreak
seriously. The radio broadcast attracted the attention of Angola's health
ministry and the WHO. But tragically, Dr Bonino contracted the disease and
died, less than a week after a laboratory in Atlanta confirmed her
suspicions. Mr Alexandre has been denounced as a witch, and his aunt was
beaten by Uige residents.
There is now a large contingent of Western health officials in the Uige
area, including Dr Heinz Feldmann, a Winnipeg-based virologist. Thanks to
their efforts, the outbreak seems to have been contained.

No evidence of Marburg fever in DRC Bas-Congo Province bordering Angola
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A medical team deployed to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Bas-Congo
Province, bordering Angola, found no trace of Marburg fever in the area.
The United Nations Mission in the DRC (MONUC) Humanitarian Section took
part in a joint meeting convened by the Congolese Ministry of Health on 12
Apr 2005 in Kinshasa. The discussion focused on the results of a
fact-finding mission that was deployed to the border with Angola for
several weeks, following the outbreak of [Marburg] hemorrhagic fever,
mostly affecting the populations of the Angolan town of Uige near the
border with the DRC. The team concluded that, although the threats that
people infected by the deadly virus in Angola will enter the DRC remain
real, there are currently no signs of Marburg fever in the area. UNHCR
representatives requested that refugee camps in the DRC towns bordering
Angola be placed under strict medical surveillance.

Angola: Angolan officials say Marburg outbreak coming under control
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Angolan officials believe the world's worst Marburg epidemic is coming
under control in the north of the country, where the war-shattered
infrastructure has limited the spread of the virus. More than 200 people
have been killed in the outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever, which causes
death through massive bleeding.
But international health workers tackling the epidemic in Uige province
have come up against local mistrust, with some people accusing them of
spreading the disease. Deputy health minister Jose Van Dunem said
government and international health workers were turning to traditional
healers and leaders to talk to the population. "We already have it under
control," he told Reuters in an interview in the capital Luanda late Sun 17
Apr 2005. "There have been no new cases in other provinces. We know exactly
how to cut the epidemiological chain of transmission."
International health workers in Uige have not yet confirmed the outbreak is
under control. Marburg, which is transmitted through bodily fluids such as
sweat, blood, and saliva, has killed 235 people and infected 22 more, the
health ministry said late on Sun 17 Apr 2005. Almost all the cases have
occurred in Uige province, north east of Luanda. A handful of cases have
been reported elsewhere in the country, but all among people who had
recently visited Uige, the health ministry said.
Nearly 3 decades of civil war have wrecked the oil producing country's
transport and health systems. Van Dumen said 70 per cent of hospitals and
clinics were destroyed before the conflict ended in 2002. This has made it
harder to tackle the disease. But Van Dumen said poor roads between Uige
and the rest of the country had also slowed the spread of the outbreak.
Residents say the main road out of the city is often all but impassable,
with flooding, potholes, and land mines still common along the route.
Health workers from the United Nations and Medecins Sans Frontieres are
working with Angolan civilian and military staff to control the disease,
but some UN World Health Organization (WHO) staff have been attacked by
locals. "Early in the outbreak, some of the health professionals died, and
some of the people have lost confidence in them," Van Dunem said.
Traditional healers and leaders could help boost trust by backing disease
prevention messages, he said. Victims are most contagious in the final
stages of the disease. Van Dunem said the virus could be defeated if
contact with the sick and dead was reduced. Many Angolans kiss and clean
the body of dead relatives before burial, and this had to be stopped, he said.
So far, the outbreak has had little impact on foreign companies operating
in Angola -- Africa's 2nd largest oil producer after Nigeria -- but
expatriate workers say they are worried even though the disease remains
outside the capital.
