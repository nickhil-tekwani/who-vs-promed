Over the past several years, Buncombe County has had several
high-profile hepatitis A scares associated with local restaurants.
That makes it an economic as well as a health issue.
Hepatitis A scares do nothing to enhance the area's appeal as a
tourist destination and also discourage locals from eating out. The
impact on restaurants can be devastating, as demonstrated a few weeks
ago with the closing of Trevi Pasta Seafood & Pizza in Biltmore
Forest following the discovery that one of the restaurant's food
service workers had the disease.
The question is: Why do there seem to be a larger number of such
scares in our region and what can be done to reduce them?
Buncombe County Health Center Medical Director Dr. Susan Mims said
the answer to what can be done is fairly straightforward:
vaccinations and diligent hand washing. Vaccination is recommended
for all children 18 years of age and younger are free from the health
department, she said.
A study by researchers at the Terry Sanford Institute of Public
Policy at Duke University concluded that vaccination of all food
handlers is not a cost-effective way to prevent hepatitis A. Still,
Asheville Buncombe Technical Community College requires all its
culinary arts students to get the immunization and that may be an
example restaurants should follow. The vaccinations are not cheap,
but given the negative consequences should an employee contract the
disease, it may well be an expense worth considering, for economic if
not public health reasons.
Eight cases have been diagnosed in Buncombe County so far in 2006,
Mims said. Two occurred in food service workers, one employed at
Trevi's and another at Larry's Earth Bar, a coffee bar inside the
Earth Fare store on Hendersonville Road. It is not yet clear whether
some of the cases are linked. That's the subject of an ongoing local,
state, and CDC investigation, Mims said.
In 2003, green onions imported from Mexico caused 16 patrons of
another local restaurant and one of the restaurant's food service
workers to contract the disease. The green onions that caused the
2003 outbreak were linked to cases in 3 other parts of the country,
where the onions had also been imported, by identifying the specific
strain of the virus, Mims said.
In 1990, 269 cases of hepatitis A were diagnosed in the county, at
least some associated with food from a concession and convenience
store at the Dreamland Drive-In Theater on Tunnel Road, which is no
longer in business. As a result of that outbreak, Buncombe County had
the highest number of hepatitis A cases in the state between 1987 and
1997, according to a CDC report, which averages the number of cases
over the 10-year period.
More recently, aside from the 16 cases resulting from the imported
onions in 2003, there were only 2 cases in 2004 and one in 2005, Mims
said. As to the number of high-profile scares associated with
restaurants, Mims theorizes that it may be because there is a large
service industry in our area and by happenstance, if there is an
outbreak of hepatitis A, it's likely some of the victims will be food
service workers.
It's important to note, she said, that while the shots offered by the
health department are an important precaution, there is not a single
confirmed case here of hepatitis A being spread to a restaurant
patron by a food service worker. Even if a food service worker has
the disease, diligent hand washing is highly effective in preventing
that person from spreading it.
It's also important to point out that in the 2003 outbreak and the
recent scares, the restaurants did nothing wrong.
That doesn't prevent them from paying the price of lost business when
a food service worker is found to have hepatitis A. Hepatitis A
immunization is a 2-part series of shots, given 6 months apart. Each
shot costs $82. Given the high turnover in the food service industry,
it's understandable that restaurant owners might be reluctant to
require employees to have the vaccine, which is extremely safe.
Still, this may be a case where it's hard to beat the wisdom of that
old cliche: An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. That
would not eliminate the risk of a scare associated with contaminated
food, like the green onions. But that's where hepatitis A vaccines
can make a big difference in the number of people who come down with
the disease. And, as Mims said, the more people get vaccinated, the
smaller the risk of spreading the disease. Parents, especially,
should take advantage of the free vaccines offered by the health
department for children 18 years of age and younger.

[This report makes a strong case for universal hepatitis A
vaccination despite the finding of the Duke University study: that
vaccination of food handlers would not be a cost-effective way of
reducing hepatitis A virus infection. The current vaccine is an
effective and safe immunogen; and the greater the proportion of the
population vaccinated the lower the risk of contracting infection. - Mod.CP]
