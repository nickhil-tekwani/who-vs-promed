Evolution of a Strain of CJD That Induces BSE-Like Plaques (Laura Manuelidis,
*William Fritch, and You-Gen Xi)
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has become a public health issue
because a recently evolved BSE agent has infected people, yielding an unusual
form of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD). A new CJD agent that provokes
similar amyloid plaques and cerebellar pathology was serially propagated.
First-passage rats [i.e., rats infected with first passage material - Mod
CHC] showed obvious clinical signs and activated microglia but had negligible
PrP-res (the more protease-resistant form of host PrP) or cerebellar lesions.
Microglia and astrocytes may participate in strain selection because the
agent evolved, stabilized, and reproducibly provoked BSE-like disease in
subsequent passages. Early vacuolar change involving activated microglia and
astrocytes preceded significant PrP-res accumulation by more than 50 days.
These studies reveal several inflammatory host reactions to an exogenous
agent.

[This new study, reported in the current issue of Science, is exciting for
a number of reasons: 1. Initial inflammation suggests a precursor virus
(which may be necessary only for prion initiation, but not subsequent
propagation). 2. Evolution of the original CJD infectious agent to a more
virulent BSE-like agent lends insight into the origin of BSE in Europe. 3.
Varied pathological presentations have implications about the possibility of
significant misdiagnosis. - RAL]
