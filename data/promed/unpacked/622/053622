Lumpy skin disease, Israel
--------------------------
Information received on 4 Feb 2013 from Dr Nadav Galon, director, Veterinary Services and Animal Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Bet Dagan, Israel

Summary
Report type: follow-up report No. 9
Date of start of the event: 1 Jul 2012
Report date: 3 Feb 2013
Causal agent: Lumpy skin disease [LSD] virus

New outbreaks (21)
[for the data pertaining to each of the 21 outbreaks, please refer to the source URL above]

Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 21
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 6185 / 101 / 3 / 64 / 0

Epidemiological comments: the disease continues to spread towards the south and west of the index outbreak. Lately, some dairy herds have been affected (small number of animals). Modified stamping out has been practised in these herds (euthanasia of the animals with clinical signs). It seems that in this season the vectors prefer warmer stables (dairy) than open, cooler and windy areas (beef).

Control measures
Measures applied: control of arthropods, quarantine, movement control inside the country, screening, spraying, modified stamping out
Vaccination in response to the outbreak(s) [as follows]:
Administrative division / Species / Total vaccinated / Details
HaZafon [Northern] / Cattle / 166 145 / Sheep pox vaccine (Jovac) [see comment]

[An interactive map showing the locations of the 21 new outbreaks is included in the original report at the source URL above (zoom in). The most southern outbreak occurred at Bet-Hashittah (http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IS/03/Bet_HaShitta.html), in the Jezreel sub-district, the 5th affected subdistrict. Currently the entire Northern district (HaZafon) is affected.

Bet-Hashittah is about 7 km (4.4 mi) from the demarcation line with the West Bank (Autonomous Palestinian Territory), in which no LSD outbreaks have been recorded so far.

Vaccinations, with a live-attenuated RM-65 sheep-pox vaccine, have already covered most if not all cattle in the HaZafon (Northern) district. The protection level rendered by the said vaccine to cattle against LSD is yet to be definitely established.

The OIE summary map with 78 accumulated outbreaks of lumpy skim disease can be accessed through WAHID's 2012 country reports (via http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Countryhome; go to Asia, Israel), or at the bottom of the pdf report at http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/69DF93E7-3652-41BB-8F97-A0206BC2BFEC/0/kateret_or_4213.pdf. - Mod.AS]
