---------------------------------------------------------------------
We would like to inform colleagues that we have reached a positive diagnosis (confirmed by sequencing) of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus variant strain 2 (RHDV-2) infection in a wild rabbit from the Isle of Man and in 3 pet rabbits from the Republic of Ireland. The pet rabbits had been vaccinated against the classical RHDV-1 within 3 months of succumbing to RHDV-2 infection. We believe these are the 1st cases confirmed in the corresponding regions. Veterinary practitioners should alert owners to the possible risks of this disease to their rabbits and the requirement for the rapid instigation of biosecurity measures in any suspected cases.

We do not know the circumstances under which the rabbits contracted the disease. However, considering the increasing number of cases reported throughout the UK these findings are not entirely surprising. RHDV (classical and type 2) is environmentally resistant and transmitted readily through direct contact or via contaminated material (such as, urine and faeces of infected animals, contaminated hay, straw, feeding bowls, and handlers' clothing), the faeces of predators (foxes, crows) and can also be carried by insects. In addition, RHDV is resistant to all but large temperature changes; therefore, washing handlers' clothes on low temperature washing machine cycles is not effective.

Vaccines for RHDV-2 or combined RHDV-1/RHDV-2 can be imported through the Veterinary Medicines Directorate's Special Import Scheme (http://www.gov.uk/government/news/rabbit-haemorrhagic-disease-virus-type-2-vaccines) in the UK or by obtaining a Special Import Certificate for the Isle of Man. In the Republic of Ireland veterinary practitioners can apply for an individual import licence under the cascade scheme from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (the so-called AR16 and AR18 licensing procedure; (http://www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/veterinarymedicinesresidues/veterinarymedicinesforms/). It is important to be aware that vaccines for RHDV-2 (unless combined with classical RHDV) might not protect against classical RHDV.

[In summer 2010 a RHDV variant, deciphered on the basis of the major capsid protein (VP60) sequence and designated RHDV-2, was detected in France, following which it spread across mainland Europe. Subsequently, the availability of efficacious commercial vaccines that afforded protection against circulating RHDV strains enabled its control; however, in wild populations the effects of vaccination campaigns are considered inconsequential.

Since August 2013, an increased number of samples submitted for the investigation of RHDV were received in the Department of Virology, Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), Weybridge, Surrey, UK, eventually leading to identification of RHDV-2.

The following information on RHDV-2 is derived from the commentary of Mod.CRD in ProMED-mail's post 20150708.3494836:

"According to recent publications, the emerging lagovirus rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) has been described as a strain that infects not only rabbits but also hares (http://tinyurl.com/pttjtp5).

"RHDV2 is less virulent and with lower observed mortality rates than RHDV and RHDVa. However, the disease resulting from RHDV2 is longer in duration and will take a chronic or subacute course more often than RHD caused by the other viral strains (http://veterinaryresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1297-9716-44-81).

"Subscribers may want to refer to these 2 interesting articles which describe this new strain:

"Camarda A, Pugliese N, Cavadini P: Detection of the new emerging rabbit hemorrhagic disease type 2 virus (RHDV2) in Sicily from rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) and Italian hare (_Lepus corsicanus_). Res Vet Sci. 2014; 97(3); 642-5; http://tinyurl.com/pttjtp5.

"Le Gall-Recule G, Lavazza A, Marchandeau S, et al: Emergence of a new lagovirus related to rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus. Vet Res. 2013; 44(1): 81; http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/44/1/81."

We are grateful to Dr Rocchi for drawing our attention to the letter published in the current edition (15 Oct 2016) of the Veterinary Record, indicating that since its preparation, they have detected 2 further cases, one in a pet rabbit on the Isle of Man and another Irish pet rabbit. Their letter deserves raised alertness of rabbit keepers, environmental/wildlife protection agencies, and veterinary practitioners in the indicated affected areas and elsewhere in the UK and Ireland.

Upon our request, Dr Rocchi has kindly provided the following timetable of the mentioned events and their respective diagnosis, for which we are similarly grateful:

- Isle of Man: wild rabbit. Received 13 Sep 2016, confirmed 23 Sep 2016, and a pet rabbit, received 5 Oct 2016, confirmed 11 Oct 2016.

- Republic of Ireland: 3 pet rabbits (same owner), received 27 Sep 2016, confirmed 7 Oct 2016, and another pet rabbit, received 5 Oct 2016, confirmed 11 Oct 2016. - Mod.AS
