Snail fever outbreak hits China
----------------------------------
China has vowed stronger measures to contain the spread of a potentially
lethal parasitic worm, carried by freshwater snails, that attacks the blood
and liver of humans, state media has reported. The Government hopes
research in its fight against the disease, known as shistosomiasis, or
snail fever, will help identify infection sources and develop new
prevention methods, the China Daily reported. It is believed that more than
one million Chinese are infected with the disease, but, given the current
prevalence of the carrier snail, a total of 65 million Chinese are in
danger of being infected, previous reports said. In 2003 alone, 843 000
Chinese were infected, most of them living in frequently flooded areas
along the Yangtze River, where the carrier snail has an ideal habitat,
according to the paper. By the 1980s, China thought that it had effectively
controlled snail fever, but a mixture of natural disasters, and human
error, has facilitated its return. After a massive deluge along the Yangtze
6 years ago, the disease moved on to large, previously unaffected areas.
The disease has been allowed to spread due to public ignorance and the
erosion of China's healthcare system, the report said.
Chronic patients, who account for most of those contracting the disease,
can experience high fever, weakness of the limbs, and severe stiffness of
the joints, the paper said. According to medical experts, snail fever has
infected more than 200 million people worldwide.

[ProMED also reported an increase in schistosomiasis in China in 2003.
Spread of schistosomiasis is usually followed by reporting the number of
cases of Katayama fever in an area. Less than 1000 cases were reported in
the year 2000 -- the last year from which we have data -- as compared to
more than 12 000 cases in 1989. Information on the number of
schistosomiasis and Katayama fever cases in 2004, and their spread to new
areas, would be appreciated. - Mod.EP]
