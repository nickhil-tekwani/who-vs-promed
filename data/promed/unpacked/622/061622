Hawke's Bay District Health Board [DHB] has admitted it failed to test hospital food for _Listeria_, despite 4 patients becoming ill with the bug and 2 of them dying. The DHB says [the] 2 patients at Hawke's Bay Hospital [who] died after getting listeriosis were both older women who had compromised immune systems. Two others, also older people with compromised immune systems, who had used hospital services also got listeriosis but have since recovered.

The cases were confirmed in May and June 2012, but processed meat such as salami, ham and pepperoni -- which are known as sources of _Listeria_ -- were not removed from the hospital menu until 10 Jul 2012. The DHB has confirmed the meat had signs of contamination, but won't say whether it was the source of the outbreak. Director of population health, Caroline McElnay, told Checkpoint the food wasn't tested because staff did not suspect the bug was in it. Dr McElnay says in hindsight the hospital could have withdrawn the meats as a precaution after the 1st patient caught the bug. She says the hospital is considering leaving processed meat off its menu permanently.

Food safety officials say they hope the outbreak is over. The DHB says the 1st of the 4 cases was notified in early May 2012 and the last on 29 Jun 2012. The Ministry of Primary Industries is seeking to identify the source and the extent of the outbreak. Its deputy director general of compliance and response, Andrew Coleman, says he hopes it won't go further than the hospital. "At this stage, it doesn't seem that it will be much broader. There's certainly been no unfortunate deaths and illnesses through the Hawke's Bay District Health Board's hospital since the June [2012] date." The DHB says investigations are still underway and it's too soon to say how the patients got the bacterium, but food is a likely source.

Pregnant women, the elderly and those with weakened immune systems are warned to be careful what foods they eat. They are advised to avoid soft cheeses, processed meats and poultry. Family doctors say people who are generally well have nothing to fear from the outbreak.

The ministry says it has overseen a voluntary recall of a number of ready-to-eat meat products. At this stage, the ministry says there is only one firm involved in its inquiry into the outbreak. Bay Cuisine of Napier supplied ready-to-eat meat products to the hospital, but the ministry says it's not clear yet whether any of these products are linked to the cases. The ministry says it's talking only to Bay Cuisine, the board's sole supplier of packed meats, at this stage but may talk to other companies.

Bay Cuisine hasn't been available for interview, but in a statement, it says it's concerned about the outbreak and 2 deaths. It says it understands the source of the contamination is yet to be determined and it's working with authorities to find the source. It says it recalled products sold in Mad Butcher stores throughout the country and in Preston's stores in Wellington, Porirua and Palmerston North, although none has shown any evidence of contamination.

[For a discussion of listeriosis, please see moderator ML's comments in the 4 prior ProMED-mail posts this year on a nosocomial outbreak in Northern Ireland: Listeriosis - UK (04): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal 20120517.1136357; Listeriosis - UK (03): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal, background 20120420.1107753; Listeriosis - UK (02): (N. Ireland) nosocomial, fatal, comment 20120418.1105643; and Listeriosis - UK: (Northern Ireland) nosocomial, fatal 20120415.1101822.

From ProMED-mail moderator LL's comments in ProMED-mail post Listeriosis, sandwiches - UK (England): alert, recall 20070326.1049:

"Because of the risk of listeriosis from sandwich cold meats, one might think that their distribution as part of a menu in locations where [there are] particularly at-risk individuals such as health care settings is not a good idea."

Comparison of the molecular characteristics, such as PFGE, of _L. monocytogenes_ strains isolated from the cases with each other and with that of strains isolated from suspected foods would help to establish whether a common source was involved and what would be the most likely source.

Hawke's Bay is a region on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. For a map of Hawke's Bay Region, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Position_of_Hawkes_Bay.png.
