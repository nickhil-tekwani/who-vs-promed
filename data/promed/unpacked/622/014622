From 22-28 Jan [2020], 5 new confirmed cases were reported in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. All 5 cases were reported from Beni Health Zone and had epidemiological links to the transmission chain that originated in Aloya Health Area, Mabalako Health Zone. The most likely exposure for all these cases was through nosocomial infection in traditional practitioner facilities. All of the cases were identified as contacts but were not followed up at the time of detection.

One confirmed case reported on 20 Jan [2020] stayed in the community for 4 days prior to being admitted to an Ebola treatment centre (ETC) and infected 2 additional people in the community. These 2 individuals, reported on 27 Jan [2020], stayed 4-5 days in the community while symptomatic prior to isolation. One other confirmed case stayed in the community for 8 days after symptom onset and passed away in the community on 28 Jan [2020]. Confirmed cases who spend time in the community increase the risk of transmission of EVD to contacts. Therefore, further cases can be expected in the coming 2 weeks in Bundji and Kanzulinzuli Health Areas and neighbouring health areas in Beni Health Zone.

In the past 21 days (8-28 Jan 2020), 28 confirmed cases were reported from 5 health areas within 3 active health zones in North Kivu province (Figure 1, Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (n=18), Mabalako (n=9), and Musienene (n=1). Beni Health Zone remains the current hotspot of the outbreak, having reported 64% of confirmed cases in the past 21 days. As of 28 Jan [2020], the following health zones marked more than 21 days without confirmed cases of EVD: Mambasa Health Zone in Ituri province (23 days) and Butembo Health Zone in North Kivu province (25 days). Of the 28 people confirmed with EVD in the past 21 days, 20 were isolated and provided care within the 1st 2 days after symptom onset, which means that they have better chances of survival and are less likely to infect contacts in the community.

In the past 21 days, encouraging trends about the development of the outbreak have been observed. The past epidemiological week (20-26 Jan 2020) saw the smallest number of cases reported since the beginning of the response; cases have been reported in 5 health areas in 3 health zones; contact tracing performance as well as the daily number of reported alerts continue to improve over time (Figure 3, Figure 4). Contact tracing has notably improved as a result of the provision of accommodation and essential services in Beni Health Zone to known contacts who have agreed to be followed. Despite these encouraging signs, continuous vigilance is warranted in order to overcome remaining challenges. Possible nosocomial transmission linked to traditional practitioner facilities remains a major driver of the current outbreak and poses specific challenges such as contact identification.

Of the total confirmed and probable cases [3421, as of 26 Jan 2020], 56% (n=1918) were female, 28% (n=963) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n=172) of all reported cases were healthcare workers [see Table 1].

The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) tracked 2 more cases in an ongoing Ebola outbreak, raising the total to 3424, of which 2242 were fatal, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard.

The latest daily update from the DRC's Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said one recent case noted on the WHO's dashboard yesterday was in Beni.

The CMRE also said 2 recent fatalities were in Beni, including one community death. Community deaths, which [take] place outside of a hospital or Ebola treatment center, raise the risk of community spread.

https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/democratic-republic-congo-ebola-virus-disease-external-situation-92

Situation update, data as of Sun 26 Jan 2020
---------------------------------------
From 20-26 Jan 2020, 4 new confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) were reported in Beni Health Zone in North Kivu province, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Among the 4 cases, 3 were registered as contacts, including one under surveillance at the time of detection. The other confirmed case was not identified as a contact and stayed in the community for 4 days prior to being admitted to an Ebola treatment centre. This individual infected the 2 most recent cases reported in Beni Health Zone through possible nosocomial transmission. This information reinforces the importance of close and thorough monitoring of patients in healthcare facilities that have concurrently admitted confirmed cases of EVD. All new cases reported in the past week were linked to the known transmission chain that originated in December 2019 in Aloya Health Area in Mabalako Health Zone.

In the past 21 days (6-26 Jan 2020), 27 confirmed cases were reported from 5 of the 50 health areas in 3 active health zones in North Kivu province (Figure 2, Table 1): Beni (59%; n=16), Mabalako (37%; n=10), and Musienene (4%; n=1) health zones in North Kivu province. In the past 3 weeks, no new cases were reported in Ituri province. As of 26 Jan [2020], more than 21 days have passed without reports of new confirmed cases in Kalunguta (29 days), Katwa (26 days), Butembo (23 days), and Mambasa (21 days) health zones.

As of 26 Jan 2020, a total of 3418 EVD cases, including 3299 confirmed and 119 probable cases, have been reported, of which 2240 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 66%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (1916) were female, 28% (963) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (172) were healthcare workers.
