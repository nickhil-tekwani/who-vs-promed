With a wide range of diseases affecting the cash crops it seems nature is
wreaking havoc on the farming community in the district [of Wayanad, Kerala
State]. Apart from devastating natural calamities, pests including wasps,
viruses, germs, fungus, and mites are causing untold suffering to farmers
there.
The 1st blows were dealt by quick-wilt and slow-wilt diseases that
completely destroyed the pepper cultivation, the backbone of the agrarian
economy in [the area]. In the Pulppalli-Mullankolli region, once known as
the pepper belt of the district, entire pepper vines disappeared leaving
only the supporting trees.
Then there was the fungus attack on arecanut. In thousands of hectares nuts
withered down. Farmers fought this by spraying a mixture of copper sulphate
and lime, but in vain.
Now, it is the turn of murikku trees [_Erythrina indica_ -- family
_Leguminoceae_, 'Indian coral'] used as the support tree for growing pepper
vines to fall victim to pest attack. Wasp attack on supporting trees had
disastrous results on pepper cultivation. According to experts the
_Quadrastichus erythrinae_ wasps [Erythrina gall wasp, a tropical plant
parasitic insect] eat away the murikku trees. "There is no doubt that we
can control the menace but as the wasp gets inside the tree, sucking the
sap, a high dosage of pesticide is needed to be sprayed on the tree. This
causes air pollution. Moreover, the toxic pesticides will also seep into
pepper vines causing health hazards," said V K Rajan, associate professor
of the Regional Agriculture Research Institute, Amabalavayal. "The disease
was reported about 10 months ago and we are in a dilemma," he added.
And losing faith in traditional crops farmers in large numbers recently
switched over to rubber cultivation, but that also got affected by various
diseases. Farmers despair that agriculture research institutions have
proved a failure in providing a solace to farmers. "The research
institutions of the state have proved to be a total failure in providing
any help to farmers," said M P Anirudhan, leader of a farmers' outfit at
Mullankolli. "Though our country is spending a huge sum of money for
maintaining such scientific establishments, the efficacy of such
institutions and their experts are questionable," he said.

Finally, after months and months of painful and patient waiting, the Rajiv
Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology (RGCB) at Jagathy has been taken over by
new administration. Announcing this Union Cabinet decision at a news
conference in New Delhi, Union Minister for Science and Technology, Kapil
Sibal, said, "RGCB is India's best biotechnology centre and the Government
of India will take it to even greater heights."
The takeover is with retrospective effect, from 1 Apr 2007. Following the
Cabinet decision, the Planning Commission has given a provisional approval
for sanctioning Rs 100 core [about USD 24.72 million] for a period of 5
years as research expense. The RGCB's request to the State Government for
an additional 3 acres [1.2 hectares] of land has been met with silence. So
also, the State Government has cut the lease period from 99 years to 30 years.
Thanking the State Government for allowing making RGCB a centre of
excellence, Union Minister, Kapil Sibal, said that the research programmes
of the institute would specifically address the problems of Kerala. These
include the problems afflicting the primary cash crops of the state like
pepper and ginger. "The fungal infections in these crop plants cause severe
production problems in the state. We are trying to develop
disease-resistant varieties using genetic engineering," said Radhakrishna
Pillai.
The institute will now streamline its activities in the coming 3-4 months.
"RGCB has expertise in certain fields like medical biotechnology and plant
biotechnology. We would be cutting down on projects that are not within our
realm and address very specific issues only," said Radhakrishna Pillai.
RGCB, ranked India's best biotechnology school in 2006 after a national
survey by the journal 'Biospectrum', can now not only dream big, but also
even become an institution with international repute.

[Quick wilt (also called foot rot) of black pepper (_Piper nigrum_) is
caused by the fungus _Phytophthora capsici_. Symptoms are black leaf spots,
leaf drop, blackening of young leaves and vines, collar infection, and
rotting or wilting of the entire vine. Once the roots are affected the
plant wilts and dies within a month. The fungus is spread by splashing rain
and mechanical means. Disease management includes fungicides, use of
disease free and resistant cultivars, and cultural practices (for example
shade regulation and avoiding areas with poor drainage). The pathogen can
also be controlled by an antagonistic fungus (_Trichoderma_ spp).
_P. capsici_ has a very wide host range and causes blight in more than 50
plant species in more than 15 families including cucurbits and solanaceous
crops. Because of this large number of potential pathogen reservoirs it is
difficult to control. The fungus occurs worldwide in temperate,
subtropical, and tropical environments. It is regarded as one of the most
serious threats to production of cucurbits and peppers worldwide, and the
most serious threat to pepper production in India. In Kerala, a traditional
pepper growing area, an average yield decline of around 50 per cent is
attributed to this disease. For some areas a yield decline of 75 per cent
is claimed.
RGCB has been developing disease-resistant genetic varieties of black
pepper and ginger. The centre has identified candidate genes suitable for
genetically engineering quick wilt disease in pepper. Methodologies for
introducing genes into these crops are being tested.
Slow wilt (also called slow decline, yellows) of pepper is caused by
nematodes, _Radopholus similis_ and possibly also _Meloidogyne incognita_.
Symptoms are leaf yellowing and shedding, root degeneration, blackening of
branches, and eventual death of the vine.
_R. similis_ was originally described from the Fiji Islands, but occurs
also in Australia, Florida, Central and South America, several Caribbean
islands, tropical Africa, and several European countries. The most
important hosts are banana ("toppling-over disease") and black pepper
(during the years after World War II, pepper culture on the Islands of
Banka, Indonesia, was almost completely destroyed by slow wilt). More than
250 other plant species are known to be hosts. It is suspected that there
exist different pathotypes within this species.
_Meloidogyne incognita_ (root knot nematode) is a devastating pathogen of a
range of crops. _Meloidogyne_ spp. have a wide host range, including many
agriculturally important crops. The genus (around 70 species) is found
worldwide in tropical and sub-tropical regions in many types of soil.
Disease management of nematodes is difficult and includes nematicides, use
of resistant host varieties, and crop rotation with non-host species.

wilt disease complex of black pepper (_Piper nigrum_ L.) in Kerala (India).

Arecanut is another name for betelnut, the fruit of the palm _Areca
catechu_. The fungal disease referred to above may be fruit rot (also
called Mahali disease) caused by the fungus _Phytophthora arecae_. This is
one of the major diseases of betelnut palm and occurs as an epidemic in
heavy rainfall areas. Symptoms are lesions on the nut surface and shedding
of fruit. The fungus may also invade the crown causing the leaves and
bunches to whither. Betelnut is chewed as a stimulant.
