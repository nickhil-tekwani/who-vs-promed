[Michiyo Yamazaki, who has kindly provided us with several translations of
official Japanese reports and other sources from Japan since the beginning
of the FMD epizootic, has forwarded the following 2 new translations [items
1, 2] with the introductory relieving comment: "We have no new FMD cases in
Miyazaki since 19 Jun 2010 (case 291 in Miyazaki city)". Let's hope this
piece of information heralds the approaching final stages of the outbreak.

Nishitachi
----------
The number of slaughtered animals 2 days ago was 3667. Yesterday [26 Jun
2010], it was 5699.

Of all animals to be slaughtered (276 049), 257 481 animals were destroyed,
with 18 568 not yet destroyed.

All of the animals not destroyed yet are vaccinated animals. We have to
speed up the slaughtering of them. At the same time, we must make all-out
efforts to prevent any new cases or new suspected cases.

It is not raining today [27 Jun 2010], but it's very hot. The highest
temperature is going to be above 30 C (86 F). Working under summer heat is
exhausting. I know the workers engaged in the killing or burial must work
hard, but I really want them to work safely without getting heat stroke or
dehydration.

In Miyazaki, the prolonged FMD outbreak decreased human activity,
especially since the state of emergency was declared, and the effect is on
the meat-related businesses, commerce and tourism directly and indirectly.

This means, in a sense, the Miyazaki residents well understand the
difficult situation and cooperate with us, but I heard that even
Nishitachi, the greatest downtown in Miyazaki, lost its customers
drastically. To see the situation myself and hear from the people in this
area, I dined out in Nishitachi today after a long absence.

I saw more people than I expected ... or there were many more than I
thought. It was partially because it was not raining and partially because
it was the weekend. Anyway I was a bit relieved.

While the sales of the weekends are a little better, those of weekdays
decreased to a large degree, someone in the area told me.

This outbreak did affect all of Miyazaki's industries. I have to do my best
to contain it and announce its end as soon as possible. I am also worried
about the harmful rumor on Miyazaki meat [safety?] in other parts of Japan.

I would like Miyazaki residents to continuously apply thorough disinfection
measures.

A. Progress
-----------
1. Miyakonojo-city
Serological tests (antibody tests) on all swine/cattle in farms within a 3
km radius or farms epidemiologically relevant to the affected farm, and
visual inspection on animals of all farms within a 10 km radius (animal
movement restriction area) have been conducted continuously since 22 Jun
2010 in Miyakonojo to confirm disease-free status.

In the evening of 27 Jun 2010, the Ministry of Agriculture reported to us
that 95 farms out of 96 farms subjected to the serological tests were found
to be negative. One farm, however, had one [head of] cattle that could not
be confirmed negative out of 25 sampled cattle.

2. Hyuga-city
Serological tests (antibody tests) on all swine/cattle in farms within a 3
km radius or farms epidemiologically relevant to the affected farm, and
visual inspection on animals of all farms within a 10 km radius (animal
movement restriction area) have been conducted continuously since 22 Jun
2010 in Hyuga to confirm disease-free status.

In the evening of 27 Jun 2010, the Ministry of Agriculture reported to us
that all of the 35 farms subjected to the serological tests were found to
be negative.

B. Future measures
------------------
1. Miyakonojo-city
One animal that cannot be confirmed negative will be re-tested just to be
safe, since all the other 24 cattle on the same farm are confirmed to be
negative, and the animal in question has no clinical symptoms.

If the animal is negative and the area is confirmed to be FMD-free by
ongoing visual inspection, the movement restriction and outward movement
restriction will be lifted at 0:00 on Fri 2 Jul 2010.

2. Hyuga-city
If the area is confirmed to be FMD-free by ongoing visual inspection, the
movement restriction and outward movement restriction will be lifted at
0:00 on Sat 3 Jul 2010.

An agriculture ministry study team has concluded that a delay in detecting
foot and mouth disease [FMD] in the early stages of its outbreak led to the
spread of the virus in Miyazaki Prefecture.

According to the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry, an
epidemiological research team led by Tomoyuki Tsuda, head of the Department
of Planning and General Administration of the National Institute of Animal
Health, found that animals had been infected with FMD in a few dozen cases
from one to 2 weeks before the disease's official confirmation.

FMD possibly spread while livestock farmers were unaware of the symptoms of
the disease, the research team said on Friday [25 Jun 2010].

The research team also found that employees of several farms in Tsunocho
and Kawaminamicho in the prefecture, where animals were infected with the
disease, had visited each other, while a feedstuff delivery service stopped
by many farms in different municipalities in the area. Kawaminamicho
neighbors Tsunocho, where the 1st infection case was detected.

Assuming those transfers of cars and people may have contributed to the
spread of the virus, the team plans to further investigate the infection
route and whether proper disinfection measures were taken.

More suspected cases of FMD were reported in Japan on Sunday [no date
included] in Miyazaki City on the island of Kyushu. According to the local
government, 4 cows were diagnosed with FMD on a farm of 725 head of cattle.
According to a statement from the prefecture of Miyazaki, all animals on
the property will have to be sacrificed to contain the spread of the disease.

[It is to be hoped that this epizootic has entered its final stage. Japan's
decision to apply a "stamping out with emergency vaccination", and
"vaccination to cull" policy with surveillance, was driven mainly by the
wish to regain speedily Japan's traditional FMD-free status without
vaccination. It is based upon the provisions of the OIE Terrestrial Animal
Health Code".

Article 8.5.45, point 2, says:
"2. slaughter of all clinically affected and in-contact susceptible animals
and vaccination of at-risk animals, with subsequent slaughter of vaccinated
animals." Japan regards, apparently, all susceptible animals within a 10 km
zone around each outbreak as at risk, therefore vaccinated.

According to article 8.5.8. ("Recovery of free status"), an FMD free
country or zone, where vaccination is not practised (such as Japan), can
apply for the reinstatement of its freedom from FMD, "3 months after the
slaughter of all vaccinated animals where a stamping-out policy, emergency
vaccination and serological surveillance are applied in accordance with
Articles 8.5.40. to 8.5.46."

The appearance of [4] above is a cause for concern. If it is correct, the
timetable of Japan's regaining FMD-free status may have to undergo some
delay. Official confirmation with details (location) or otherwise would
help. - Mod.AS]
