69 workers have died, and at least 200 others have been hospitalised in northeastern India after drinking toxic liquor, officials said on Sat 23 Feb 2019, in the latest case of alcohol poisoning in the country.

The deaths in Assam state came less than 2 weeks after tainted liquor killed about 100 people in the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand.

"We have recorded the deaths of 50 persons in Golaghat since Thursday night [21 Feb 2019]," Dhiren Hazarika, deputy commissioner of Golaghat district in Assam, said.

Another official from the neighbouring district of Jorhat said that 19 people had died there after consuming a batch of "spurious liquor."

The victims, who include many women, worked at local tea estates in the region.

"The people came to the hospital with severe vomiting, extreme chest pain and breathlessness," doctor Ratul Bordoloi, joint director of Golaghat's health department, said.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has ordered an inquiry.

State police said they have arrested one man for selling the liquor, and authorities said 2 excise department officials were suspended for failing to take adequate precautions over the sale of the alcohol.

Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said the patients were being treated at different hospitals in the affected districts.

Hundreds of mainly poor people die each year in the South Asian country from tainted liquor, which normally costs just a few US cents a bottle.

Of the estimated 5 billion litres of alcohol drunk every year in India, around 40 percent is illegally produced, according to the International Spirits and Wine Association of India.

Many Indian states have implemented or pushed for prohibition, which, according to critics, further increases the unsupervised manufacture and sale of alcohol.

At least 150 people have died from drinking toxic bootleg liquor in a northeastern state of India, the 2nd such tragedy in the country this month [February 2019], with many more hospitalized as authorities try to pinpoint the source and round up perpetrators.

The figure is based on reports from 3 hospitals in the eastern part of the state, Assam. Authorities had estimated the number of dead at 84.

"We have still more than 170 people admitted in hospitals with new patients being brought in from nearby areas. Some developed complications 2 days after consuming the liquor," Assam's health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.

"We have sent samples for forensic examinations to ascertain the ingredients used in the particular lot of spurious liquor leading to the deaths of so many people," he added.

The Assam liquor tragedy comes almost 2 weeks after more than 100 people died from drinking tainted alcohol in 2 northern Indian states, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, in the worst such case in the country since 2011.

Deaths from illegally-produced alcohol, known locally as "hooch" or "country liquor," are a regular occurrence in India, where many cannot afford branded spirits.

In Assam, bootleg liquor production and consumption is usually found in and around the state's tea plantations where it is consumed by poorly-paid laborers.

There were about 10 different distilleries producing the spurious liquor going to various tea plantations and other areas, said Mrinal Saikia, a local lawmaker from the Bharatiya Janata Party, which rules Assam and the country. But the main ingredient used in the country liquor was supplied by one person from a nearby area, he said.

"Close to about 1500 people must have consumed that lot of spurious liquor on Thursday [21 Feb 2019] leading to the deaths of 150," Saikia said.

"We are interrogating them and will soon find out the source and people involved in supplying that toxic lot of spirit," said Mukesh Agarwal, Assam's additional police chief.

[While illegal alcohol or some mixture thereof occurs from time to time, it seems to be primarily because methanol is used instead of ethanol.

"Methanol toxicity initially lacks severe toxic manifestations. Its pathophysiology represents a classic example of lethal synthesis in which toxic metabolites cause fatality after a characteristic latent period. In other words, these people may not realize they are sick or ill until some time after consumption.

Methanol is sometimes used as an ethanol substitute for alcohol. Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, fermented beverages, and diet soft drinks containing aspartame are the primary sources of methanol in the human body, but [they contain] minute quantities.

Wood alcohol is also known as methanol. It is a commonly used toxic organic solvent causing metabolic acidosis, neurologic issues, and death when ingested. It is a part of many commercial industrial solvents and of adulterated alcoholic beverages or is mistaken as being the same as alcohol for ingestion. Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the developing world, especially among members of lower socioeconomic classes.

Neurological complications are recognized more frequently due to advanced technologies and because of early recognition of the toxicity and advances in supportive care. Hemodialysis and better management of acid-base disturbances remain the most important therapeutic improvements.

Serum methanol levels of greater than 20 mg/dL correlate with ocular injury. Funduscopic changes are notable within only a few hours after methanol ingestion. The mechanism by which the methanol causes toxicity to the visual system is not well understood. Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, is regarded as being responsible for ocular toxicity, and blindness can occur in humans.

The prognosis in methanol poisoning correlates with the amount of methanol consumed and the subsequent degree of metabolic acidosis; more severe acidosis confers a poorer prognosis. Methanol has a relatively low toxicity. The adverse effects are thought to be from the accumulation of formic acid, a metabolite of methanol metabolism. The prognosis is further dependent on the amount of formic acid that has accumulated in the blood, with a direct correlation existing between the formic acid concentration and morbidity and mortality. Little long-term improvement can be expected in patients with neurologic complications.

The minimal lethal dose of methanol in adults is believed to be 1 mg/kg of body weight. The exact rates of morbidity and mortality from methanol intoxication are not available.

Rapid early treatment is necessary for survival, but sequelae such as blindness may be permanent.

Metabolic acidosis in methanol poisoning may necessitate the administration of bicarbonate and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate potentially may reverse visual deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may help to decrease the amount of active formic acid.

Antidote therapy, often using ethanol or fomepizole, is directed toward delaying methanol metabolism until the methanol is eliminated from the patient's system either naturally or via dialysis. Like methanol, ethanol is metabolized by ADH, but the enzyme's affinity for ethanol is 10 to 20 times higher than it is for methanol. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH; however, its use is limited because of high cost and lack of availability.

Hemodialysis can easily remove methanol and formic acid. Indications for this procedure include (1) greater than 30 mL of methanol ingested, (2) serum methanol level greater than 20 mg/dL, (3) observation of visual complications, and (4) no improvement in acidosis despite repeated sodium bicarbonate infusions.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10% dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment."
