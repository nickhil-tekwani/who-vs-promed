A middle-aged man has been admitted to a hospital in Spain's Castile and Leon region [see description below] after being diagnosed with Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), authorities said on Thursday [21 Jul 2022].

The disease, which has a fatality rate between 10% and 40% according to the World Health Organization (WHO), was first detected in Crimea in 1944.

It is often found in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia and more rarely elsewhere in Europe. It can transmit between humans by close contact with blood or bodily fluids, the WHO says.

In the latest Spanish case, the man was first admitted to a local hospital in the northwestern city of Leon when he showed symptoms of the disease after being bitten by a tick and was later transferred to another hospital on a military plane on Thursday, the Defense Ministry said.

"He has a tick bite and remains in a stable condition, despite the clinical severity that this pathology implies," local health authorities said in a statement.

Tick bites or contact with animal blood or tissue are frequent causes of the disease, which generates symptoms including fever, muscle ache, dizziness, sore eyes, light sensitivity, vomiting, and a sore throat in the early stages and can lead to organ failure and internal bleeding.

Spain detected its first case of CCHF in 2011 and a Spanish man died in 2016 after being diagnosed with the disease following a tick bite.

["Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral disease caused by CCHF orthonairovirus, which is endemic in regions of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and western and south-central Asia. The virus has caused major outbreaks in EU/EEA neighbouring regions, principally in the Balkan region, Turkey and Russia. CCHF orthonairovirus is typically spread via the bites of ticks of the Hyalomma genus. These ticks are widely distributed across southern and eastern Europe. CCHF orthonairovirus can also be transmitted via direct or indirect contact with blood or the organs of viraemic hosts (animals or humans). Therefore, healthcare workers attending to CCHF patients may be exposed to the virus if they do not take appropriate protective measures.

"CCHF was first diagnosed in Bulgaria in the mid-1950s and became endemic in some regions of the country. In Greece, the 1st and so far only autochthonous case was reported in 2008. In 2016, Spain reported its 1st autochthonous cases in the province of Ávila, Castile-León." Since then, Spain has reported sporadic cases almost every year. According to the ECDC data, 2 cases were reported in 2021 in Salamanca and León provinces.

Sánchez-Seco et al recently reported results of a large scale tick surveillance study and documented the distribution of CCHFV in 5 regions in Spain covering the central and southwest parts of the country.

"Clinicians, especially general practitioners, as well as laboratory staff, public health workers, stakeholders, and the general public need to be aware of the situation regarding CCHFV in Spain. Because some clinical cases may be mild and etiologically unresolved by practitioners, suitable tools must be made available that can detect the virus in suspected clinical cases in Spain. Diagnosis of CCHF is hampered by the biosafety conditions required to manage a virus of high biologic risk.

"Public health activities, including surveillance of zoonoses like CCHF, need to be carried out under the One Health umbrella, as was done in our study. Large-scale seroprevalence studies in animals and humans are currently underway. The huge effort required to coordinate local and national public health representatives and entomologists, virologists, and animal and human health specialists should be an essential step in the control of these pathogens."

"Castile and León is an autonomous community in north-western Spain. It was created in 1983, 8 years after the end of the Francoist regime, by the merging of the provinces of the historic region of León: León, Zamora and Salamanca with those of Castilla La Vieja (Old Castile): Ávila, Burgos, Palencia, Segovia, Soria, and Valladolid. Up-until-then the Castilian provinces of Santander and Logroño opted out of this merging and succeeded in creating the new Autonomous Communities of Cantabria and La Rioja respectively.

Castile and León is the largest autonomous community in Spain in terms of area, covering 94,222 km2. It is however sparsely populated, with a population density below 30/km2. While a capital has not been explicitly declared, the seats of the executive and legislative powers are set in Valladolid by law, and for all purposes that city (also the most populated municipality) serves as de facto regional capital.

Castile and León is a landlocked region, bordered by Portugal as well as by the Spanish autonomous communities of Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, the Basque Country, La Rioja, Aragon, Castilla-La Mancha, the Community of Madrid, and Extremadura. Chiefly comprising the northern half of the Inner Plateau, it is surrounded by mountain barriers (the Cantabrian Mountains to the North, the Sistema Central to the South, and the Sistema Ibérico to the East) and it is drained by the Douro River, flowing west toward the Atlantic Ocean."
