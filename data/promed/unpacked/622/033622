Some 27 people have been admitted at Laisamis Level 4 Hospital following an outbreak of kala-azar [visceral leishmaniasis] in Laisamis sub county in Marsabit.

The facility's Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Abshiro Hapicha however, said the patients, were responding well to treatment. A majority of the patients, he added are from Logo.

"A total of 27 patients who tested positive to kala-azar have been admitted in this hospital and are currently undergoing medication. I can say that their response is good," Hapicha said.

Consequently the CEO made an appeal for concerted efforts among the national and county governments and other agencies in eradicating the sand flies that transmits the disease. "There is need for massive awareness campaign to control the spread of the disease and if possible to eliminate it," he said.

He said pastoralist communities sleep on sand outside their houses during dry seasons which expose them to sand flies. "High levels of poverty and illiteracy among residents have also been established to be other factors that expose them to kala-azar," he added.

Kala-azar has an incubation period of between 2 weeks to 6 months with symptoms being fever, weight loss, anemia, and swelling of the spleen and liver.

Meanwhile, Kargi MCA [Member of the County Assembly], Asunta Galgithelle has asked the government to consider establishing kala-azar control centres fully equipped with diagnostic facilities and testing kits in parts of the county that are prone to the disease. Galgithele urged partners in the health sector to join hands in bringing the menace under control.

According to records with the department of health, 44 cases out of 102 reported since 2016 turned positive.

[In recent years, ProMED has reported an increasing rate of visceral leishmaniasis in South Sudan, which is highly endemic. Also visceral leishmaniasis is found in Somalia and the recent civil wars in both countries may be linked to an increase of cases in Northern Kenya.

A recent review of leishmaniasis worldwide, including Kenya, (Alvar J, Velez ID, Bern C, et al, and and the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5): e35671; supporting information S50; https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671), states that in Kenya "Since 1980, the number of reported cases increased considerably and expanded into new areas. In Baringo and Pokot area, there is a continuous high endemicity, which affects the very poor tribal nomadic population. In other areas, VL [visceral leishmaniasis] occurs in outbreaks that are associated with periods of drought, when the rate of malnutrition is high. The outbreaks are probably related to people movement from high to low endemic areas due to the lack of food security." - Mod.EP
