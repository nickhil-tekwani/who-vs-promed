The West Australian Health Department has warned visitors and residents in
the south-west that they risk contracting Ross River virus.
The department's environmental health director Michael Jackson said today
conditions for breeding mosquitoes that transmit the virus were ideal
because of above average spring rainfalls and recent warmer temperatures.
He said the department's routine monitoring program had already shown the
virus to be present in coastal areas between Rockingham and Augusta.
"However, people throughout the south-west should be aware that both viruses
[and mosquitoes are not necessarily confined to the coast," Mr Jackson
said.
"Typical symptoms of Ross River virus infection vary considerably, but can
include painful or swollen joints, sore muscles, skin rashes, fever, chronic
fatigue and headaches."
He said there was no cure for the disease and no vaccines to prevent it.
People should avoid being outside when mosquitoes were most active, wear
loose clothing and keep insect repellent handy.
Mr Jackson said the Health Department would carry out mosquito control
programs where possible, but warned people to take personal protection
measures as well, because all mosquitoes could not be eliminated.

[The West Australian Health Department may have the best surveillance
program in the world -- better than California's, which is a good one. In
collaboration, UWA (University of West Australia, which does most/all of the
work), the WA government, and local governments, collect a myriad of data:
numbers of mosquitoes, number of positive pools, antibody surveys (human),
sentinel chickens, temperature, precipitation, etc. They may soon be
tacking on GIS (geographical information systems).
So when WA says there is an alert, they mean business. - Mod.CHC
