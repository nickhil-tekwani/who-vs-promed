7 dead, 150 000 evacuated in China gas leak
-------------------------------------------
7 people were killed, 3 injured, and up to 150 000 evacuated after large
amounts of toxic chlorine gas leaked from a factory in southwest China's
Chongqing municipality on Friday, state media said.
The highly irritating, greenish-yellow gas began leaking from the Tianyuan
Chemical Industry Plant in the Jiangbei district in downtown Chongqing on
Thursday evening [15 Apr 2004], local workers and the Xinhua news agency said.
Local authorities later began evacuating all residents within a 1-km radius
of the factory, rousing many from their slumber.
In the Dongfang Jiayuan housing compound alone, 5000 to 6000 people were
evacuated, said a property management official at the compound surnamed Lee.
"Around 2 am today [Fri 16 Apr 2004], all the guards woke up all the
residents in this housing compound and told them to leave," Lee said. "They
were mainly taken to the cafeterias at government offices." Tens of
thousands of people were evacuated by Friday evening, Xinhua said.
Firefighters estimated at least 7 liquefied chlorine gas furnaces, with a
load of 6 tons of chlorine gas each, are letting off toxic fumes.
Inhalation of 2.5 mg of chlorine gas is enough to cause death, and symptoms
of inhalation include bronchial spasm and respiratory difficulty.
Several explosions were reported, including loud explosions as late as 5:57
pm local time, according to Xinhua, which had earlier reported that a large
chlorine cooler blew up. Residents living near the scene, who were
temporarily allowed to return to their homes, were evacuated again following
the explosions.
More than 600 soldiers were mobilised for rescue work and more than 100
have been sent to the scene to evacuate residents.
About 10 workers from the factory have reported minor respiratory problems
but are not in danger, Xinhua quoted Miao Guangkui, head of the rescue
team, as saying. "Most of the people evacuated are family [members] of
workers," a worker said.
It was the 3rd chlorine gas leakage at the plant since 2003, another worker
at the plant was quoted by Xinhua saying. Sources said the municipal
government had planned to move the chemical plant, which employs about 2000
workers, from downtown areas to Wanzhou district, a new city zone located in
the 3 Gorges Reservoir area. A diplomatic source in Chongqing said the
incident happened close to downtown Chongqing. Many of the people evacuated
will spend the night outdoors downtown, he said.
In the Dongfang Jiayuan compound, only security guards remained, a guard said.
"It's serious. People's armed police and police are evacuating people," the
guard said. "Only guards remain in the compound. They've given us face masks."
In December 2003, a massive blast at a company facility near Chongqing city
released a cloud of toxic gas that forced the evacuation of 60 000 nearby
villagers. A total of 243 people died and thousands more were poisoned,
making it China's worst industrial accident. The site, owned by PetroChina,
was being drilled by a CNPC subsidiary. The chairperson of PetroChina -- who
is also the president of its parent company, China National Petroleum
Corporation, China's largest oil and gas company -- has resigned over the
incident.
