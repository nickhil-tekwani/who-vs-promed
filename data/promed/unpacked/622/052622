Brucellosis situation threatens to spiral out of control in Dagestan
--------------------------------------------------------------------
On 8 Dec 2011, in Makhachkala the deputy prime minister Murat
Shikhsaidov held a meeting on the epizootic situation in the republic.
The ministers, heads of responsible departments, and the heads of
cities and districts were invited to the meeting.

According to Murat Shikhsaidov, if drastic measures are not undertaken
in the near future, the situation of brucellosis in the country will
spiral out of control.

During the first 11 months of the current year, brucellosis has been
diagnosed in 1620 head of cattle and in 826 sheep and goats.
Brucellosis is a dangerous disease transmitted via animals to humans.
According to the National Center for Infectious Diseases, for the
first 11 months of 2011, 248 local residents fell ill with
brucellosis, 138 of them with the acute form of the disease.

According to the chairman of the Committee on Veterinary R&D, Mahomed
Gazimahomedov, the numbers of animals annually examined for
brucellosis in the country are 600 000 cattle, 300 000 sheep and
goats, 6000 horses and 500 dogs.

The main problem, as noted by the speakers, is the lack of sanitary
slaughter sites. For this reason, cattle are often slaughtered in
backyards without complying with basic veterinary and sanitary
regulations, adversely affecting the epizootic situation and
facilitating the spread of brucellosis. Another problem is the
uncontrolled importation of cattle from other regions of the country
infected with brucellosis.

Speakers offered to establish permanent and mobile veterinary
inspection posts on the border of Dagestan with the Stavropol
Territory and Kalmykia which, in tandem with the law enforcement
agencies, are expected to inspect the cattle trucks that enter the
republic.

[It would be interesting to obtain information on the species of
brucellosis bacteria involved; these are likely to be _Brucella
abortus_ and _B. melitensis_. In addition, data on the control policy
and vaccine applied in the relevant animal species, namely large and
small ruminants, would be helpful.
