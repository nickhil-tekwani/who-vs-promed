From: Paul Levett <levett@sunbeach.net>

Terry Ally was correct: _Streptococcus iniae_ has been isolated from the
organs of reef fish (dead and dying) affected in the fish kill in Barbados
recently. Similar outbreaks have occurred in waters around in Tobago,
Grenada and St.Vincent.
The working hypothesis at present seems to be a stronger than usual "Guyana
current" has brought extra freshwater and silt from the north coast of
South America. This is turn has caused eutrophication of the water column
and an excessive bloom, removing oxygen and stressing the fish enough to
allow infection with _S.iniae_.
I would also like to hear from anyone who knows of more reports of marine
fish infection, other than the recent report by Zlotkin et al. Possible
transmission of _Streptococcus iniae_ from wild fish to cultured marine fish.
