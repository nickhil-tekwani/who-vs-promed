WHO: Availability of new recombinant H5N1 vaccine virus
-----------------------------------------------
The WHO Global Influenza Programme is continuing to monitor the
antigenic and genetic evolution of circulating H5N1 viruses and their
human isolates. In August 2006, WHO reported (Weekly Epidemiological
Report 2006; 81(34/35):328-330. Antigenic and genetic characteristics
of H5N1 viruses and candidate H5N1 vaccine viruses) that analysis of
newly isolated viruses collected from both animals and humans
indicated that the H5 hemagglutinin (HA) genes had become genetically
distinguishable from the H5N1 viruses that had previously been
selected for vaccine development. Furthermore, there was also
evidence of antigenic variation among the recent viruses. Since then,
WHO Collaborating Centres (WHO CCs) and H5 Reference Laboratories
have been developing several new recombinant H5N1 vaccine viruses
that are representative of this newly discovered genetic sub-group of
clade 2 viruses.
The WHO CC in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
Atlanta USA and the China Centers for Disease Control, Beijing China
have together developed a new recombinant H5N1 virus from
A/Anhui/1/2005 selected from clade 2, sub-clade 3. The recombinant
vaccine virus is available for distribution, under a Material
Transfer Agreement (MTA). The sequences of hemagglutinin (HA) and
neuraminidase (NA) of the new H5N1 recombinant vaccine virus can be
found on the public website of Los Alamos National Laboratory
database together with all other WHO selected and developed influenza
vaccine viruses for both seasonal and H5N1 influenza.
Institutions, companies and others interested in pandemic vaccine
development who wish to receive this recombinant vaccine virus should
contact either the WHO Global Influenza Programme at
<whoinfluenza@who.int> or WHO CC CDC at the address below:
"WHO Collaborating Center for Surveillance, Epidemiology and Control
of Influenza, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1600
Clifton Road, Mail stop G16, Atlanta, GA 30333, USA (fax: +1 404 639
2334; e-mail: <rdonis@cdc.gov>)."
Review of the needs and the actual development of H5N1 vaccine
viruses representative of circulating strains in the world are
ongoing in WHO CCs and H5 Reference Laboratories. The WHO Global
Influenza Programme will continue to select, verify and develop new
H5N1 candidate vaccine viruses from genetically and/or antigenically
different groups of circulating viruses for the purposes of vaccine
research and development.
