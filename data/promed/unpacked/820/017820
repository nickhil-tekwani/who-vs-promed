District health authorities intensified surveillance activities in
Bhorphatha and Saharanpur villages of Ankleshwar, Bharuch district, after a
cholera-positive case was reported from Saharanpur village recently. While
4 cholera cases were reported from Vagara in Bharuch in 2006, this is the
1st case to have been detected in Central Gujarat region in 2007, said
Bharuch district health authorities.
Besides this, district health authorities have started taking precautionary
measures and have also alerted areas lying within an 8 km (5 mi) radius of
Saharanpur village.
In-charge chief district health officer (Bharuch), Dr Swapnil Shah, said
the in-charge district collector had recently issued a notification to
public and district health authorities after a 2 year old girl was admitted
to the government hospital in Saharanpur on 18 Jul 2007 with cholera.

[4] Cholera - Comoros Islands (Grand Comoros)
Date: Tue 7 Aug 2007

An outbreak of cholera has killed 8 people and infected scores of others on
the Comoros Islands since July 2007, a senior doctor said, blaming the food
at traditional wedding parties for spreading the disease.
The epidemic on Grande Comore (or Grand Comoros), the largest of the 3
islands in the Indian Ocean archipelago, coincided with the holiday months
when villagers prepare feasts for weddings.
"The cholera epidemic has killed 5 in August 2007 and 3 in July 2007,"
Abdoulbar Youssouf, the director general of El-Marouf hospital, the
Comoros' largest, told Reuters.
He added that in at least one outbreak over the weekend, nearly 50 people
were infected at a wedding party, probably through dirty drinking water or
salads. Grande Comore is known for its extravagant weddings, where many
spend their life's savings on gold, gifts, and feasts.
Mohamed Moundhiri Djoubeiri, the doctor in charge of the cholera ward at
El-Marouf, said traditional feasts were to blame for spreading it. "The
government should ban big dinners during the epidemic periods," he said.
