The Austrian veterinary services officially confirmed an outbreak of Bovine Tuberculosis [bTB]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last week, 39 heads of cattle were slaughtered on a farm in the Tyrol "Zillertal" on suspicion of bTB. Following the positive results of rapid PCR test, it has been announced today [21 Nov 2012] that additional 65 cattle as well as 10 goats have been slaughtered.

The official veterinarians ordered the killing of the animals to prevent further spread since more than 40 percent of the animals on the farm showed a positive or "suspected" test result [see commentary].

The origin and the way the disease has been introduced is not known yet but will be investigated using the "genetic fingerprint" on bacteria grown from samples of the animals. The result should be available in 2 months time according to Mr. Koessler.

All cattle herds in contact with the affected herd have been tested for bTB; 4 animals on a contact farm tested positive. The animals have been slaughtered and will undergo intensive testing [see comment]. Depending on the results which should be available early next week it will be decided how to proceed.

[The screening testing of cattle for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is traditionally carried out by the tuberculin test: intradermal injection of bovine tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) with subsequent detection of swelling (delayed hypersensitivity) at the site of injection 72 hours later. For further details of this test and of the laboratory tests of the organs of slaughtered, tuberculin positive animals to confirm the diagnosis and accomplish the identification of the agent, subscribers are referred to chapter 2.4.7 of OIE's Terrestrial Manual at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.07_BOVINE_TB.pdf.

Austria was one of the 1st 8 EU Member States recognised as 'officially free of bovine tuberculosis' (OFT) by the end of 2001. Such countries maintain their OFT status in spite of sporadic cases, as long as at least 99.8 percent of their herds remain uninfected.

According to Austria's annual reports to the OIE, during the years 2009 -- 2011, 6 bTB outbreaks have been reported, of which 2 in 2009, 1 in 2010 and 3 in 2011, all in south-west Austria, namely 5 in Tyrol and 1 in Vorarlberg. (map at http://www.freeusandworldmaps.com/images/Countries_Maps/EuropeanCountries/Austria_Europe.jpg).

According to OIE's 2011 data, the cattle population of Austria is 2 007 855 (in 71 497 "cattle establishments"). - Mod.AS
