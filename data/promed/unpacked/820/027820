The Council of Agriculture (COA) convened an emergency meeting on Monday to
deal with the FMD [foot-and-mouth disease situation on the offshore island
of Kinmen [Quemoy as a second ranch there was reported to have been
infected with the FMD [virus.
COA officials after confirming the Shao Ser Fu ranch has been infected with
FMD [virus, demanded all 45 cattle on the ranch be slaughtered following
the example of the Hsin Yao Chih ranch where an outbreak was discovered last
week. The COA has decided to conduct FMD tests on all 3000 head of cattle on
Kinmen, the officials said.
The COA has asked that virus samples taken from infected cattle on Kinmen be
brought to a FMD laboratory in Britain for analysis so as to find a suitable
vaccine.
Meanwhile, a member of an FMD task force under the COA said if the Kinmen
strain of FMD [virus has spread onto Taiwan proper, the hog, cattle and
goat industries will be threatened. Professor Lai Hsiu-huei of National
Taiwan University said the FMD strain in Kinmen is different from the FMD
strain found in the hog population 2 years ago.
The new strain of FMD [virus is a big worry to COA officials as it, unlike
the strain 2 years ago that didn't infect cattle, sheep and goats, can be
spread to all cloven-hoofed animals.

[Earlier there was some thought that smuggled cattle could have brought the
virus in. However, research has shown that FMD virus can be carried long
distances on the wind. It has been blown across the English Channel -- more
than 22 miles - Mod.TG
