Key updates
-----------
Angola epidemiological update (as of 1 Sep [2016]):
There have been no new confirmed cases since 23 Jun [2016].
Phase I of the preventive vaccination campaign in Angola was completed, and as of 1 Sep [2016], 2 807 628 people had been vaccinated. Phase II of the campaign is being prepared and will target more than 3 million people in 12 provinces.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) epidemiological update (as of 8 Sep [2016]):
There have been no confirmed cases related to the current outbreak since 12 Jul [2016].
The 1st notified case reported in Bominenge Health Zone in Sud Ubangi province is still under investigation. A 2nd case was notified from Budjala Health Zone, a different zone within Sud Ubangui province, in the week to 8 Sep [2016] and is being investigated.
The pre-emptive vaccination campaign in DRC has concluded. The preliminary results indicate that the administrative immunization coverage reached 103.1 per cent in Kinshasa, 101 per cent in Kasai Central, 98.3 per cent in Kongo Central, 101 per cent in Kasai, 101 per cent in Kwango, and 100.8 per cent in Lualaba. Independent monitoring assessed that vaccination coverage is 98.2 per cent in Kinshasa.

Uganda declared the end of their yellow fever outbreak on 6 Sep 2016. This outbreak was not linked to the outbreak in Angola and DRC.

Analysis
--------
The overall risk assessment remains unchanged.
There have been no confirmed cases linked to the current outbreak in DRC since July 2016. This week, there have been no new Health Zones reporting suspected cases. Nevertheless, it is important to note the inherent difficulties in surveillance and laboratory confirmation capacities.
Independent monitoring of vaccination efforts in Kinshasa have demonstrated excellent coverage, providing a high level of population immunity against yellow fever in this area.
Global vaccine stocks are adequate to complete all planned vaccination campaigns and to respond to new cases and/or outbreaks in other countries, should they arise.

Epidemiological situation
-------------------------
Angola
- There has been no confirmed case since 23 Jun [2016]. The situation remains stable with a low number of suspected cases reported over the past month.
- From 5 Dec 2015 -- 1 Sep 2016:
- 4065 suspected cases, with 372 deaths (case fatality rate (CFR): 9.2 per cent);
- 884 cases have been laboratory confirmed, with 121 deaths (CFR:13.7 per cent);
- Since the start of the outbreak, suspected cases have been reported from all 18 provinces; confirmed cases have been reported from 80 districts in 16 provinces. Autochthonous transmission has been reported from 45 districts in 12 provinces;
- Luanda and Huambo provinces have reported the highest number of total cases. As of 1 Sep [2016], 2063 cases (including 488 confirmed) were reported in Luanda, and 636 cases (128 confirmed) were reported in Huambo.

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC)
- From 1 Jan [2016] -- 8 Sep 2016:
- 2603 suspected cases reported from all 26 provinces;
- 75 confirmed cases have been identified from 2253 suspected cases that have been laboratory tested, with 16 deaths (CFR: 21.33 per cent);
- of the 75 confirmed cases, reported from 7 provinces, 57 acquired infection in Angola, 13 are autochthonous, and 5 are cases of sylvatic [forest] transmission (not related to the outbreak);
- Sud Ubangui province, which borders the Republic of the Congo and Central African Republic, reported a notified case in Bominenge Health Zone for the 1st time in the week to 25 Aug [2016]. The investigation is still ongoing to confirm or discard the case, identify whether it is imported or autochthonous, and determine whether it is related to the current outbreak or is a sylvatic case. A 2nd notified case was reported in the week to 8 Sep [2016] in Budjala Health Zone, which is also in Sud Ubangui province, and is also under investigation;
- The investigation of the 2 sylvatic cases reported in the week to 25 Aug [2016] in the Yalifafu Health Zone in Tshuapa province has concluded and found that these are isolated cases;
- the 13 autochthonous cases were reported from 10 Health Zones in 3 provinces: Kinshasa (6 cases), Kongo Central (2 cases) and Kwango (5 cases);
- the date of onset of the most recent confirmed case in Kinshasa is 22 Jun [2016]. The date of onset of the most recent confirmed case in DRC is 12 Jul [2016] in the Kahemba Health Zone in Kwango province.

Response
--------
Information on the current outbreak continues to be updated on the WHO website.

Vaccination campaigns have been completed in 73 municipalities in Angola and 15 962 052 people (65 per cent of Angola's population) have been vaccinated. A pre-emptive vaccination campaign was launched on 15 Aug [2016]; phase I of the campaign was completed, and, as of 1 Sep [2016], 2 807 628 people had been vaccinated. This represents 94 per cent of the target population. 15 of 22 districts targeted in Phase I achieved at least 90 per cent administrative vaccination coverage. Supplementary vaccination activities are ongoing in the 3 districts (Dirico, Namacunde and Sumbe) where vaccination coverage has not reached 80 per cent. Phase II of the campaign is being prepared and will target more than 3 million people in 21 districts in 12 provinces.

The pre-emptive vaccination campaign in DRC has concluded. The preliminary results indicate that administrative immunization coverage reached 103.1 per cent in Kinshasa, 101 per cent in Kasai Central, 98.3 per cent in Kongo Central, 101 per cent in Kasai, 101 per cent in Kwango, and 100.8 per cent in Lualaba. Independent monitoring assessed that vaccination coverage is now 98.2 per cent in Kinshasa. As of 8 Sep [2016], more than 10 million people have been vaccinated in Health Zones that reported. A reactive vaccination campaign is being planned in Feshi Health Zone (Kwango province) and Mushenge Health Zone (Kwango province).

WHO has sent nearly 27 million vaccine doses to Angola and DRC through the International Coordinating Group (ICG) global stockpile and with additional vaccines from Bio-Manguinhos in Brazil.

As of 7 Sep 2016, 18.1 million vaccine doses have been approved for Angola and 9.4 million doses for DRC.

The number of vaccines currently available for the emergency response is 4.0 million through the ICG. The amount of doses already allocated to respond to the outbreak is not included in this number.

[It would appear from this report that availability of yellow fever (YF) vaccine has not been a problem, likely due to dose sparing (1/5th the usual volume). The DRC preemptive campaign, carried out in just 10 days, was remarkably successful. The YF situation in the Republic of the Congo, Brazzaville (RC), seems uncertain. A reliable source of information indicated that samples from the RC were sent out of the country for laboratory testing. There has been no announcement confirming that or providing results. In a recent communication, Dr Daniel Lucey commented that a significant change in the situation might be under way if one or more lab-confirmed non-sylvatic cases are documented in the DRC on the (unvaccinated) border with Republic of Congo (far away from Kinshasa). The above WHO weekly update reported a 2nd such suspect case from the same Province [Sud Ubangui province] in the DRC, which borders Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic. These 2 cases are big red flags that carry major implications -- if lab-confirmed as YF non-sylvatic cases -- for an immediate YF cross-border vaccination campaign in a completely new area before the rains start later this month [September 2016]. ProMED-mail thanks Dr Lucey for pointing this out, and awaits the results of further investigations and the laboratory test results with considerable interest and concern. - Mod.TY
