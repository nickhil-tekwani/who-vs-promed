Just a reminder on 2 issues:

1) The BRRAT Laboratory is not the only CDC LRN [Laboratory Response Network] National Reference Laboratory; USAMRIID [US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases] and NRMC [Northern Regional Medical Command] are also.

2) CDC discontinued the _Bacillus anthracis_ direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) in 2012. USAMRIID still has material available, outside of the CDC LRN system. As a side note, USAMRIID has advanced the _B. anthracis_ DFA into a tandem DFA where it is essentially a one-step DFA for co-visualizing both capsule and cell wall polysaccharide using 2 different fluorescent labels on the same prep. (patent pending).

As far as specifically the DFA itself, we can distribute the DFA reagent but it will take a material transfer agreement, which could take a month or so. But the DFA is no longer a "CDC LRN" confirmatory method, meaning, while still a valid confirmation, it is outside of the LRN system now.

As far as USMARIID being a national laboratory in support of LRN, the Department of Defense Instructions 6200.03, "Public Health Emergency Management Within the Department of Defense," paragraph 4.g, authorizes Department of Defense (DoD) LRN reference and national laboratories to accept clinical specimens from non-DoD health care beneficiaries for analysis when referral of the specimen is consistent with the intended use of LRN tests and the mission of the LRN. The issues therefore revolve around "clinical specimens" versus environmental. Then the overriding DoD document includes another caveat: "Further, such support shall generally be provided on a reimbursable basis, unless non-reimbursable care is specifically authorized."

Then there is the USAMRIID mission, outside of the LRN, where we do things for "science" reasons. So it really depends on the situation and what is needed, what we can do.

[Thanks to Mark for telling us of an alternative DFA availability now that the CDC versions are temporarily unavailable. His tandem DFA sounds to be both neat and very useful. - Mod.MHJ]
