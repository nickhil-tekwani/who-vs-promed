Emerging Pathogen: Cyclospora outbreak in Houston
56 out of 89 patrons who attended a banquet at a local hotel on 25 April
1997 developed symptoms resembling cyclospora infection; as of 20 May, 14
had confirmed (by stool sample) cyclospora infection. Approxiimately 85
patrons completed questionaires; statistical information developed from
those questionaires indicated that there was a high probability that the
infection resulted from eating a bavarian creme dessert which contained
fresh strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries, garnished
with the same fruit items.
There have been no other reported cyclospora cases in Houston during this
period, although approximately 11 of the hotel's food service staff have
developed similar symptoms; confirmation of cyclospora in that group has not
occurred yet. Tracebacks to the suppliers and/or direct importers of the
berries are continuing.

Tracebacks from this outbreak will be compared with tracebacks occurring in
the other reported outbreaks during this period to determine commonality of
importers and/or specific growing farms.
