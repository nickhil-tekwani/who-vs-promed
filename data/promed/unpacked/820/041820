The number of people sickened in an _E. coli_ outbreak linked to the Milk Makers Fest [21-23 Apr 2015] has jumped to 32, the Whatcom County Health Department reported Thu 30 Apr 2015. 4 were hospitalized, said Greg Stern, Whatcom County health officer.

About 1325 Whatcom County 1st-graders, plus the teachers and parents who accompanied them, went to the event 21-23 Apr 2015 at the Northwest Washington Fair & Event Center in Lynden. The 22nd annual event was sponsored by the Whatcom County Dairy Women. In addition to the investigation, the health department will see if there are ways to improve safety at such events. "We want to work with them to improve safety and still have people engaging with these educational activities and learning more about farming," Stern said. "We want people to experience it safely, and so does the agriculture industry."

The event introduced young students to farming. It also gave them a chance to pet farm animals, including small horses, sheep, rabbits, chickens and a calf. There also was a hay maze and scavenger hunt. The health department is looking for the cause of the outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing _E. coli_. Most of those reported ill were 1st-graders. Some adults and older children who were at the event also became sickened, according to the health department.

Of the 32 cases traced to the festival, 17 have been confirmed by the state's public health lab or tested positive at local labs -- or were people with _E. coli_ symptoms who had been in close contact with someone in the first two groups and 15 additional people had been at the festival and were sick but lab results, some of which were pending, weren't available yet.

The health department has been interviewing the sick students and their parents to find out whether there was a common food or water source or activity, such as the petting zoo or other contact with livestock. Students from the Bellingham, Blaine, Ferndale, Lynden, and Nooksack school districts attended.

Symptoms of the bacterial illness include severe stomach cramps, diarrhea that is often bloody, and vomiting. Illness occurs up to 10 days [but usually 3-4 days - Mod.LL] after people are infected, which happens when they swallow minute amounts of feces, usually not visible to the naked eye. The main sources for [this disease-causing type of] _E. coli_ are contaminated food, water and surfaces, along with contact with livestock. It is common for this type of _E. coli_ to be spread to others living in the same household.

As for the event, the children there were given pasteurized chocolate milk and they brought sack lunches from home. The Milk Makers Fest had places for people to clean their hands with soap and water or hand sanitizer. Volunteers and parents manned them, according to the Whatcom County Dairy Women. The group said all the children and adults who attended were required to wash their hands with soap and water at the exit/entry to the dairy barn before they received their chocolate milk. There also were 3 hand-sanitation stations at the entrance and exit of the trailer for the petting zoo and hay maze, the group said.

Health officials are reminding people that they should wash their hands carefully with soap and running water, especially after using the bathroom and before preparing food for eating. If soap and water aren't available, people can use alcohol-based hand sanitizers to reduce the number of germs in some instances. But they aren't a substitute for hand-washing, according to the CDC.

[The state of Washington can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3335496,4648. Whatcom County is in extreme northwestern Washington bordering British Columbia and can be found on a map at http://geology.com/county-map/washington-county-map.gif.

The number of suspected or proven cases of the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ has jumped from 6 to 32 so far and appears to involve both adults and secondary cases as well as the children who attended the agricultural fair. While the petting zoo remains the primary suspect as the source of the EHEC, other sources are also being investigated. The serotype of the EHEC has not been stated.

The prototypic EHEC strain is, of course, serotype O157:H7. As a reminder, other non-O157 _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with EHEC disease include motile ones such as O26:H11 and O104:H21 and non-motile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle, and although they cause as many as 30 per cent of outbreaks of EHEC (1), they appear to be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6).

If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify EHEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157 strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4 strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.
