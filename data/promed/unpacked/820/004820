One person has died in Rombo district, Kilimanjaro region, after being [infected] with [_Bacillus anthracis_]. The deceased contracted the infectious disease [anthrax] which is transmitted through contact with meat from an infected animal. 4 other people are receiving treatment at the Huruma Hospital [Rombo district], the designated district medical facility in the area.

Dr Mtumwa Mwako has called on the livestock keepers in the Rombo district to take their animals for vaccination and to avoid consuming meat which has not been certified as safe by veterinary experts.

Symptoms of the anthrax include bleeding profusely, abnormally high temperatures and skin rashes, he said, adding that it may take some time until symptoms became visible. The disease is curable if treated in early stages.

This report has no information on laboratory confirmation, so it must be "suspect" for the moment.

Cutaneous anthrax is more than a "rash", it is a black ulcer. But it is curable if treated promptly with antibiotics. And the incubation period depends on the effective dose, the bigger the dose, the shorter the incubation period. As exposure to a carcass, either directly during butchering or from meat, it tends to be short, sometimes merely hours. The disease is sporadic in Tanzania but regularly spills out of the national parks where it can be persistent. - Mod MHJ
