Vietnam, the country worst hit by bird flu, reported 2 new outbreaks
this week with more than 1300 fowl killed as the government boosted
efforts to detect the H5N1 virus early.
An Agriculture Ministry report seen on Thursday said 300 ducks died
in the central province of Quang Nam, and animal health workers
slaughtered another 1000 while tests for bird flu, which experts fear
could trigger a human pandemic, were still underway.
It said 15 ducks died on Tuesday [8 Nov 2005] in the northern
province of Bac Giang, where more than 134 000 chickens, ducks and
geese were slaughtered last week during its 1st outbreak this winter.
Agriculture Minister Cao Duc Phat urged local authorities to provide
more information on the epidemic to farmers to help detect outbreaks
quickly.
"Poultry slaughtering should be centralised so the animal health work
can be done better," Phat said on state-run Voice of Vietnam radio.
Around 30 million ducks, or 60 percent of Vietnam's waterfowl, carry
the H5 component of the virus, Phat has said. [Is this information
based upon serology? - Mod.AS]
On Monday [7 Nov 2005], all 3 of Vietnam's deputy prime ministers and
6 ministers started touring different areas in a 2-week campaign to
shake up [energize? set up?] prevention plans and preparations for a
pandemic.
Since bird flu arrived in December 2003, 92 people in Vietnam are
known to have caught the virus and 42 have died, fanning the fears of
experts that the virus could mutate into a form passed easily between
people, which it cannot now.
The latest Vietnamese bird flu victim was a 35-year-old man in Hanoi
who died in late October 2005. But a suspected case, that of a
24-year-old woman from Bac Giang province, turned out to be a false
alarm, Pham Ngoc Dinh, deputy head of the National Hygiene and
Epidemiology Institute, was quoted on Thursday as saying by state
media. [Map at

[2] China: Liaoning; national precautionary measures

2 outbreaks of bird flu have been reported in Fuxin and Jinzhou, both
in Northeast China's Liaoning Province, where the previous case was
also detected. [Map & province's details at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liaoning>].
The new outbreaks bring the total number of confirmed bird-flu cases
to 6 since October 2005.
About 1100 chickens were killed in the latest outbreaks, which were
reported to the provincial health authorities on 6 Nov 2005.
The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory confirmed yesterday
[9 Nov 2005] that the latest cases involved the deadly H5N1 strain of
bird flu.
Local governments have culled about 500 000 poultry within a 3-km
radius of the outbreak sites to prevent the spread of the deadly
virus.
On Tuesday [8 Nov 2005], Premier Wen Jiabao called for intensified
efforts to fight bird flu as the country faces a "very serious
situation." Bird flu has not been brought under total control and is
likely to spread, Wen warned on Tuesday during an inspection tour of
Heishan County in Northeast China's Liaoning Province.
He urged the local governments to focus on the prevention of human
infections, a task he described as "arduous."
China is the world's largest producer of poultry, and local
governments should be fully aware of the great danger posed by the
epidemic, Wen said. He urged areas with a large number of poultry or
close to the bird flu-hit regions to draft emergency plans for
possible outbreaks.
In Heishan, more than 10 million poultry were culled since the
outbreak in late October 2005.
Health authorities fear that as H5N1 virus spreads, it is more likely
to mutate, making it contagious among humans. Bird flu has killed at
least 64 people in Southeast Asia since 2003.
Wen inspected medical stations and poultry disposal sites, and met
poultry farmers and medical workers in Heishan.
Villager Jiang Lianfu told the premier that all his 13 000 chickens
were slaughtered even though they were not affected. He got 10 yuan
(USD 1.23) in compensation for each bird. Wen thanked him for
co-operating with the government, and said that compensation should
be paid in time.
Local authorities in other parts of the country have been stepping up
efforts to halt the spread of the disease.
In Shanghai, the government has told farmers to set up nets around
poultry farms to prevent possible infection from migratory birds,
Xinhua reported. In addition, all poultry should be bred in
enclosures.
Such measures are necessary, as Shanghai and Heishan are on the same
bird-migration route, according to Zhang Suhua, an expert with the
Shanghai Agricultural Commission. In East China's Zhejiang Province,
wildlife workers have stepped up monitoring of migratory birds. Major
habitats of migrant birds are now under 24-hour observation, said Yu,
a senior official at Zhejiang Wildlife and Plant Protection Office.
In Northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, zoo workers have stopped
feeding animals with live poultry to prevent possible spread of bird
flu, officials at Harbin Northern Forestry Zoo said yesterday. They
have ordered more beef and mutton instead.
Zou Ximing, deputy director of the zoo, said they were keeping a
vigilant eye on the birds in the zoo, now considered a "highly
dangerous group." All 3000 birds of 100 species have been vaccinated,
he said.
At the province's Zhalong Nature Reserve, health workers have
vaccinated all the 100 red-crown cranes there.
The Wildlife Park Beijing has also halted feeding tigers and lions
with live chickens in October 2005.

According to the update, 198 million chickens have been vaccinated in
the said province in response to the outbreak. 3 vaccines have been
applied:
1. Inactivated mono H5N2 Vaccine;
2. lnactivated recombinant H5N1 vaccine;
3. Live recombinant avian pox virus vectored H5 vaccine.

[3] Kuwait - 2 suspected birds

2 cases of bird flu have been detected in Kuwait, officials said on
Thursday [10 Nov 2005]. They are the 1st cases of the disease
announced in the Gulf region. The 1st case is said to have come from
a bird imported into Kuwait and was discovered at the airport, while
the 2nd was in what is believed to be a migrating wild fowl found on
a beach. Both diseased birds have been killed. It is not yet known if
they had the H5N1 strain of the virus, which can be fatal for humans.
"The expertise of our authorities has prevented 2 incidents (of bird
flu) in Kuwait," said Sheikh Fahd al-Salem al Sabah, head of Kuwait's
Public Authority for Agriculture and Fisheries (PAAAFR).
He assured reporters that the situation was dealt with quickly and
the bird flu was therefore not allowed spread. He also said that no
humans in Kuwait had the disease.
Only on Tuesday [8 Nov 2005] the director of the Kuwaiti Health
Ministry's Public Health Department, Dr Rashed Al Owaish, told a
conference in Geneva sponsored by the World Health Organization that
the emirate was ready to face any outbreak of bird flu.
He said Kuwait was taking the threat the disease posed seriously and
the cabinet had allocated 5.4 million Kuwaiti dinars (almost 18.5
million US dollars) for the purchase of vaccines, with the 1st
shipment due to arrive in late December 2005.
At the end of the 3-day conference on Wednesday [9 Nov 2005]
delegates outlined a 6-point global action plan, ranging from curbing
the virus in birds to enhanced detection to funding for countries at
risk.
The current H5N1 virus, linked to widespread poultry outbreaks which
began almost 2 years ago in Vietnam and Thailand, has only infected
125 humans so far, killing 64 of them, but health experts have warned
that the virus could evolve into a global human influenza pandemic if
it mutates into a form which could transmit easily among people.

3 Asian nations reported more outbreaks of bird flu in poultry on
Thursday, a day after health experts unveiled a USD 1 billion global
plan to halt the spread of the virus.
China, Vietnam and Thailand said they had more outbreaks as the
region heads into the northern winter, when the H5N1 avian flu virus
seems to thrive.
Vietnam, where the virus has killed 42 people, will send soldiers and
police to help contain avian flu and Agriculture Minister Cao Duc
Phat called on provincial authorities to do more.
"We must launch a campaign to build each hamlet, each commune into a
stronghold for fighting the epidemic," Phat was quoted as saying in
Nong Nghiep Vietnam, a newspaper run by his ministry. "In an
emergency, the army will be deployed to isolate the infected area,"
he said.
Adding to the unease, the sudden death of a flock of ducks also
suggested a more virulent strain was at work, another Vietnamese
official said.
Experts fear H5N1 could mutate into a form that passes easily among
people, just like human influenza. If it does, millions could die
because they would have no immunity.
Chinese state media reported 2 new outbreaks in poultry in the
northeast, bringing the total number of outbreaks to 6 since the
start of October 2005. Thailand said tests confirmed the presence of
H5N1 in 2 provinces next to the capital Bangkok, a city of 10 million
people.
Health and veterinary officials from around the globe ended a 3-day
meeting in Geneva on Wednesday [9 Nov 2005] and announced a strategy
aimed at rooting out bird flu among poultry and stopping it from
spawning a pandemic.
"What is important to me is there has been consensus and clarity,
(and) much better coordination. We'll be much quicker to control
avian influenza as a result," David Nabarro, the U.N.'s chief bird
flu coordinator, told reporters after the meeting at the World Health
Organisation.
WHO chief Lee Jong-Wook said the strategy aimed to boost early
warning systems, strengthen veterinary services, make it easier for
rich and poor nations alike to get antiviral drugs and step up
research into pandemic vaccines.
"Investments are urgently needed at the national level, potentially
reaching USD 1 billion over the next 3 years," he said.
The H5N1 virus is endemic in poultry across Asia, where it is known
to have infected 124 people and killed 64. It has been found in birds
in eastern Europe and there are fears migrating flocks could take it
to the Middle East and Africa.
Indonesia reported its 6th death on Wednesday, but this is still
subject to final test results.
China, the world's most populous nation, is showing just how hard it
is to control the virus, which has so far defied a mass culling
campaign involving thousands of paramilitary police.
Xinhua news agency said the new outbreaks occurred in villages near
Heishan in Liaoning province, where last week's outbreak was reported.
China has already killed 10 million birds in Liaoning and Premier Wen
Jiabao warned this week that the country was facing a "very serious
situation". China has yet to report a human case of bird flu, though
the WHO is helping probe a possible human case in Hunan province,
which had an outbreak in October.
The virus is also spreading fast in Vietnam and the urgency there was
reinforced by Veterinary Institute head Truong Van Dung, who told a
government meeting that bird flu might have become more virulent.
He cited the death of a flock of ducks in Bac Giang province within 3
to 4 hours, even though none showed symptoms of the virus while alive
but tested positive afterwards. [Such a peracute mass mortality is,
at the very least, an uncommon observation. Details on the tests
performed, as well as description of PM findings, will help. Other
etiologies, including poisoning, deserve to be excluded.- Mod.AS]
Asia-Pacific leaders will put prevention of a bird flu pandemic high
on the agenda of their annual summit next week, and discuss plans on
how to coordinate and minimise damage from an outbreak.
"It is critical that APEC member economies recognise this regional
threat and prepare to mitigate the impacts of an avian influenza
pandemic," a draft proposal reads.
Afghanistan, a stopover point for birds during their annual migration
from Siberia to the warmer Indian subcontinent, said on Thursday it
had banned duck hunting and imports of live poultry. The country has
not reported any cases of H5N1.
