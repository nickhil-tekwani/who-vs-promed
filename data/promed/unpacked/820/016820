Health sector moves to curb dengue fever spread
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and southern provinces on Tuesday discussed urgent
measures to curb dengue fever, which is spreading across the country,
particularly in the Mekong River delta. By Tuesday, more than 17 700 people
had contracted the disease, and 33 had died.
The Ministry of Health asked cities and provinces to prepare human
resources and medical equipment for the fight in the immediate and long
term periods. Other measures include killing larvae, spraying chemicals
against mosquitoes, monitoring the spread of the disease germs, and
reducing fatalities.
It was reported that most of the dengue fever infections were children
under 15 years old, accounting for 92.3 per cent of the total. Up to 80 per
cent of the infected patients died within 6 days after contracting the
virus. Symptoms included enlarged liver, bloody vomit, and rash.
According to the Ministry of Health, within a month (19 May to 19 Jun
[2004]) more than 4000 infections were reported in 31 localities. Of the
total, 10 people died. In southern Soc Trang province alone, there were
2560 infections and 9 deaths. Since early this year [2004], the number of
infections has mounted to nearly 18 000, a year-on-year increase of 79.5
per cent.
Central Khanh Hoa province announced an outbreak of the disease on Tuesday.
About 400 infections have been detected, up 23.5 per cent against the same
period of 2003.
According to the National Preventive Medicine and HIV/AIDS Control
Department director, Trinh Quan Huan, the high [rate of] infections [is
attributable] to the favourable weather leading to an outbreak in southern
provinces. He said the density of the mosquito population was reportedly
high in An Giang, Can Tho, HCM City, Dong Nai, and Long An. Among the 4
virus types (D1, D2, D3 and D4), this year [2004] virus type D2 was
identified as the major cause of about 70 per cent of infections and high
mortality rate. In addition, the number of adults contracting the virus has
increased dramatically.

27 infected with dengue in city
-------------------------------
Dengue fever, a mosquitoborne viral disease, has made a comeback in the
capital for the 5th consecutive year. A total of 27 people affected with
the virus were admitted to different city hospitals yesterday [21 Jun
2004]. The Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) authorities are yet to take
measures to spray insecticides in the areas where the _Aedes_ population is
high.

41 dengue patients hospitalised
-------------------------------
As many as 41 people suffering from dengue fever were admitted to different
city hospitals in the last 24 hours until yesterday evening [23 Jun 2004].
Doctors said most of the dengue cases are normal dengue fever, but many of
the suspected cases are yet to be confirmed. They also said some of the
cases have symptoms of dengue haemorrhagic fever, a potentially dangerous
illness that may lead to internal bleeding, putting the patient in a state
of shock. The fever is now spreading in different parts of the capital.

[27 + 41 = 68 cases do not sound like many in a city of 10 million, but
this figure looks set to double in a week, signifying the start of an
epidemic, and in any case may be only the tip of the iceberg. - Mod.JW]
