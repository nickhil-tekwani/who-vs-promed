According to a statement of the Directorate of Agricultural Services made on Thu 19 Mar 2015, 42 head of cattle were confirmed as affected with foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in 7 suspected outbreaks in the territory of the province of El-Bayadh [Algeria]. Immediate measures were taken by the veterinary inspection of the province to contain the disease.

The veterinary inspector of the province said 40 cases of the disease, detected at a farm in the region known as "Behidhane Naam," 20 km [12.5 mi] from the town of Bougtob, were confirmed in cattle after laboratory analysis, and the other 2 cases were recorded in the town of Kef El Ahmar.

According to Mr Houari Saad, 47 other cattle could be affected with this disease in the districts of Roggassa, Cheguig, El Kheither, Tousmouline, and El Abiodh Sidi Cheikh, as initial findings have revealed the same symptoms in the suspected foci.

As a preventive measure to avoid the spread of disease, veterinary services took a series of steps to identify suspicious FMD outbreaks, including isolation of cases, the ban on entry and exit of herds in regions under veterinary control, the organization of transport of livestock, as well as coordination of efforts with the veterinary inspections in neighboring provinces.

Since the inception of 1st cases, the same services launched a vaccination campaign in mid-February [2015]. To date, more than 65 000 sheep, 6233 goats, and 866 cattle belonging to more than 215 farmers have been immunized.

This campaign will continue to expand to the entire herd across the province, said the provincial veterinary inspector, stating that no cases of FMD in cattle were recorded last summer [2014] in the province and that "there is every reason to believe that the spread of the disease originated from the eastern provinces of the country."

[Maps of Algeria can be seen at http://www.mapsofworld.com/algeria/maps/algeria-political-map.jpg and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3245522,20921. The province of El Bayadh is located in the west of Algeria; it includes 3 geographic areas split into 22 communes: High Plains (6 towns), Saharan Atlas (13 municipalities), and pre-Saharan zone (3 municipalities); see map at http://www.wilaya-elbayadh.gov.dz/and/Bayadh-5.jpg.

Bougtoub and Kef El Ahmar, where FMD outbreaks have been confirmed, are 2 contiguous districts in the high plains, north of the province. El Abiodh Sidi Cheikh, where the disease is also suspected, is located in the pre-Saharan zone, which means that the infection has spread over the entire territory of the province. Thus, after the detection of FMD in small ruminants, cattle in the province have in turn been affected, and outbreaks seem to spread rapidly within the entire receptive animal population.

Enhanced vigilance is required in neighboring provinces as well as in east Morocco, a country which has so far managed to maintain its disease-free status. The scenario in which the disease was introduced to El Bayadh, through small ruminants before affecting cattle, should encourage the Moroccan veterinary authorities to reconsider their decision to restrict booster vaccination only to cattle. - Mod.AB

FMD virus is notorious for severely affecting ruminant offspring, particularly causing "tiger heart" in lambs, kids, and calves under the age of 2 months. It will be interesting to note if such age group is currently present in Algeria's sheep/goat flocks, and if they were affected.

The FMDV strain which caused the epizootic in Tunisia and Algeria during 2014 has been genotyped as O/ME-SA/Ind2001. It may be assumed (though deserving confirmation) that the current outbreaks in Algeria are caused by the same strain. According to vaccine matching results obtained by the World reference laboratory for FMD, the vaccine strain 'O/TUR/5/09', and, to a somewhat lesser extent, 'O-3039' and 'O/TAW/98', match the addressed Indian strain, while 'O BFS' matching is questionable and 'O Manisa' seems not to match (see 20140830.2736965). O Manisa and O BFS 1860 were among the vaccine strains included in vaccines applied in the Maghreb during 2014.

ProMED-mail's RFI's on the valences and strains included in the vaccine(s) currently applied in Algeria (archives 20150105.3072470 and 20150311.3222002) are pending. Such information from the other Maghreb countries (Morocco and Tunisia) will be appreciated as well. - Mod.AS]
