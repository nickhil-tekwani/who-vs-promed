Seaweed products recalled for the potential to cause botulism poisoning
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has recalled lemonade and gel products sold by Royalty Sea Moss. After a complaint from the Maryland Department of Health, an investigation found that Royalty Sea Moss, based out of Mt. Pleasant, MI, produced products with inadequate processing controls that are needed to stop the growth of foodborne pathogens, according to the department.

Royalty Sea Moss also does not have a license to manufacture, hold or sell products, which is a violation of the Michigan Food Law of 2000, officials said.

The following are products noted by the department for having inadequate
labeling, including ingredient statements, lot codes, and sell-by dates:

- Regular Sea Moss Gel

- Fruit Flavored Sea Moss Gel:
Mixed Berry with Blueberry Strawberry Raspberry
Pineapple Cherry Strawberry
Peach Strawberry Flavor
Strawberry Dragon fruit
Mango Pineapple
Strawberry Banana

- Sea Moss Lemonade:
Lemonade:
Blue Raspberry
Mango
Lemonade
Watermelon
Strawberry Peach
Green Apple
Pink Strawberry
Strawberry Lemonade
Grape
Pineapple
Strawberry Kiwi
Cherry
Fruit Punch

Improperly processed food and drink have the chance to be contaminated with _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium that can cause life-threatening illness or even death, according to the department. No illnesses have been reported, but consumers are warned not to use the product, even if it doesn't look or smell spoiled, according to the department.

[Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED posts such recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated (yet) with the food products. Most food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures that could, but do not necessarily, result in the germination of viable spores of _Clostridium botulinum_.

The following is extracted from https://www.everydayhealth.com/diet-nutrition/what-is-sea-moss-irish-moss-a-complete-scientific-guide/:

"The scientific name for sea moss is _Chondrus crispus_, which is a species of red algae that grows on rocky coastlines along the Atlantic coast across the British Isles, continental Europe, and North America. It is a small, spiky or frilly seaweed that resembles red leaf lettuce, except it can come in a variety of colors -- from yellow-green to dark purple. The main component of sea moss is carrageenan, a gelatinous substance used to thicken a variety of foods, including dairy products, processed meats, and infant formula. Carrageenan is also used in cosmetics and medications.

"Sea moss has a long history of being used for purported nutritional and medicinal benefits. Some evidence points to the use of sea moss in Chinese medicine as far back as 600 B.C., and by 400 B.C., it had become a food source across the British Isles. Sea moss proved an important source of nutrition in Ireland during the Great Famine in the mid-19th century, and Irish immigrants later established seaweed farms in the United States. Following agar shortages during World War II, sea moss increased in popularity as a replacement food thickener and emulsifier.

"Today, some of those same properties have sea moss making an appearance in the aforementioned wellness products -- and there might be some merit to the claims, though research is limited."
