4 more deaths and 6 fresh cases of mysterious fever have been reported,
taking the casualty toll in the current spread of suspected encephalitis to
84 in 6 districts of Andhra Pradesh. Unofficial sources had put the death
toll at 103, but the Health Services Director said that the latest figure
was 84, including 4 more deaths in the last 24 hours. A child in Warangal
and 3 children in adjoining Karimnagar district died, while 6 fresh cases
-- 3 from each of the 2 districts -- were reported, taking the number of
cases to 157. The official gave the breakdown as Warangal 66, Karimnagar
58, Nizamabad 11, Adilabad 9, Krishna 11, and Nellore 2.
As anti-vector measures, the authorities conducted anti-larval operations
in 171 villages of Karimnagar and 33 villages in Warangal. Besides, fogging
was done in 37 villages of Karimnagar and 23 of Warangal. Pyrethrum was
sprayed in 37 villages of Karimnagar and 23 of Warangal, while malathion
spraying was conducted in 12 villages of Karimnagar and 10 of Warangal. As
part of the preventive and control measures taken, chlorination of drinking
water sources was regularly checked on residual chlorine. Altogether 84
medical and paramedical teams have been deployed to conduct surveillance
and for treatment, the Director said in a statement.
However, as more casualties were reported, the Government constituted a
5-member committee of experts to conduct a detailed analysis and suggest
remedial measures to stop the spate of viral fever deaths in the State. At
a review meeting on the precautionary measures, Chief Minister N
Chandrababu Naidu said anti-mosquito operations should be taken up in the
State for the next 3 months on a war-footing. In a press release later, he
said a detailed calender should be formulated to raise awareness and take
up cleaning operations like road sweeping, keeping the premises clean and
tidy, chlorinating drinking water, and intensifying the anti-larvae
operations. Audio and video cassettes, pamphlets, and posters should be
brought out to spread awareness. The Chief Minister will be holding a
150-minute discussion with officials and the public to take up preventive
measures to curtail the spread of diseases especially, SVE [suspected viral
encephalitis -- see newswire below - Mod.MPP], GE [? JE - Japanese
encephalitis] and dengue in the State. The programme would be telecast
live on Ku Band, Doordarshan Saptagiri (DD-8) and In-Cable.

Andhra viral fever toll mounts to 87, state machinery on high alert
----------------
With 10 more deaths of children due to viral fever in 3 districts of Andhra
Pradesh, the toll has mounted to 87, even as the state machinery has been
put on high alert to check its spread.
During the last 24 hours, 5 deaths were reported from Warangal, 4 in
Karimnagar, and one in Ranga Reddy district, official sources said.
Expressing concern over the alarming rise in death rate among children due
to the viral fever, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu announced setting up
of a 5-member expert committee to conduct an analysis of the suspected
viral encephalitis (SVE), they said.
The expert committee is expected to submit its report in a couple of days,
they said.
Naidu, who earlier had announced an ex-gratia payment of Rs 50,000 [USD
1084] for each of the family of the deceased, exempted medical and health
staff from taking part in the ongoing janmabhoomi community development
programme. He asked them to be on high alert in Telangana districts of
Adilabad, Karimnagar, Warangal, Nalgonda and Nizamabad districts.
Niloufer hospital superintendent Dr Nck Reddy said 3 children who were
brought in a bad condition on Wednesday, died within an hour, and about 10
children with similar symptoms were undergoing treatment.
Medical teams from National Institute of Communicable Diseases, Delhi, and
National Institute of Virology, Pune, have collected the blood samples to
identify the virus and the reports are awaited, official sources said.
The state would set up a research and analysis cell to conduct a detailed
investigation into the SVE outbreaks reported in certain pockets of the
state in 2002 to carry out a comparative study, according to an official
release.
The cell would submit its report soon besides advising the health
department on the measures to be taken to contain SVE and other undiagnosed
outbreaks, it said.

[In the last ProMED-mail posting on this outbreak (see Unexplained deaths -
India (Andhra Pradesh) (02) 20030709.1679), there was a suggestion that
preliminary testing at the "New Delhi-based National Institute Communicable
Diseases and Pune's National Institute of Virology" had identified Japanese
encephalitis as the etiology of this outbreak. The above newswire further
supports this, as there are vector control activities underway, presumably
aimed at interrupting the vector-borne transmission of Japanese
encephalitis (see comments on earlier referenced ProMED-mail article for
listing of known vectors in India). It should be noted that all of the
information posted thus far on ProMED-mail related to this outbreak comes
from newswire reports and not from official reports from either the Andhra
Pradesh Department of Health or the National Ministry of Health. More
information on this outbreak and investigation from official sources would
be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
