On 17 Oct 2020, the Netherlands reported HPAI H5N8 in 2 mute swans (_Cygnus olor_); the dead mute swans were found in a wetland area in Kockengen, Utrecht. See the report at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review? page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=36235.

The following 3 paragraphs are excerpted from the OIE Avian Influenza Portal (https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/avian-influenza-portal/what-is-avian-influenza/):

Wild birds, as natural host and reservoir for all types of avian influenza viruses, play a major role in the evolution, maintenance, and spread of these viruses. The main wild species involved have proved to be waterfowls, gulls, and shorebirds; however, the virus seem to pass easily between different bird species.

The incidence of infection appears to be seasonal, with the highest isolation rate being in juvenile birds in the fall of the year. Several routes of exposure of wild bird viruses to poultry have been documented or suspected of being the origins of outbreaks. Direct exposure to wild birds is the most likely transmission factor.

Therefore, limiting exposure of poultry to wild birds through confinement rearing and other biosecurity measures provides an opportunity to reduce the risk of introduction of avian influenza virus from wild birds, and consequently is key to decrease the risk of evolution into highly pathogenic forms, exposure and infection of humans, and recombination with human virus components to form viruses that can not only infect humans but readily transmit among humans.
