Measles outbreak in Christchurch school
---------------------------------------
A total of 4 Christchurch Boys High School pupils have been confirmed as
having measles this week [29 Jun-3 Jul 2009] and another is suspected of
having the disease. Canterbury District Health Board's Community and Public
Health Division has been working with the school, pupils, and parents to
prevent the disease spreading further. Measles, sometimes known [in New
Zealand] as English measles, is a viral infection that can lead to ear
infections, pneumonia, and/or diarrhoea. Sometimes it can cause serious
problems such as inflammation (swelling) of the brain.

Canterbury medical officer of health Dr Ramon Pink said, "the boys who are
unwell are being isolated at home and their close contacts are being
advised to stay at home for several days unless they have had 2 MMR
[measles, mumps, and rubella] immunisations which would give them immunity
from the disease. Those who have not been immunised should visit their GPs
(general practitioners) and receive their immunisations. It really is
important for children to be immunised against this disease, which can
produce some serious complications," he said. All pupils and parents at the
school are being told of the measles cases and have been asked to contact
their GP if they see any signs of the disease which include fever, red eyes
(conjunctivitis), runny nose, spots on the inside of the mouth and a rash
which appears in days 3 to 7 of the illness.

Immunisation is the only effective means of preventing the disease and
controlling it in the community. The measles vaccine is included in the MMR
vaccination which is given at age 15 months and 4 years as part of the free
childhood immunisation programme. Immunised children occasionally still
develop measles but it is usually not as severe as in the unimmunised
cases. Immunisation is 99 per cent effective after the 2nd dose. Most
adults are considered to be immune because of previous infection. If a
non-immune person gets vaccinated within 3 days of exposure he/she may not
develop measles.
