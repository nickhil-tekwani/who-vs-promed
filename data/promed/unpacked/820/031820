[Cases continue to be confirmed in Riyadh. Of interest is that one of today's newly confirmed cases is in an asymptomatic individual who had contact with a confirmed case - the 1st asymptomatic contact reported from Saudi Arabia in some time. The documentation of asymptomatic infections may well help to understand the sporadic cases without a history of exposure to camels. It will be interesting to see the duration of the asymptomatic infection, and whether there are any 3rd generation infections identified as contacts of this 2nd generation infection.

The total number of MERS-CoV infected individuals confirmed by Saudi Arabia is now up to 1242 including 528 deaths.

All of the cases in today's update above are reported from Riyadh. - Mod.MPP]

[The above report confirms the ongoing nosocomial transmission in a hospital in Madinah, with reports of 5 cases from this outbreak. Interestingly enough, it only confirms 3 cases associated with the ongoing outbreak in Riyadh. In contrast, according to the Saudi MOH reports on these cases, there were 7 cases reported from Riyadh that had a history of contact with other case(s) in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Of the 22 cases, 8 were healthcare workers (5 from Riyadh and 3 from Madinah).

Overall, of the 22 reported cases in this period, 14 were reported from Riyadh, 5 from Madinah, and one each from Shaqra, Alkharj, and Aldwadmi,

It appears as though infection control measures have been suboptimal in the hospital associated outbreaks, especially given the involvement of healthcare workers.

[3] Saudi Arabia, Hajj - media report 17 Sep 2015
Date: Thu 17 Sep 2015

Saudi minister says MERS cases are reducing before haj
-----------------------------------------
A recent surge in cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a sometimes deadly virus, in Saudi Arabia has ebbed in the run-up to Islam's annual haj pilgrimage, the kingdom's Health Minister Khaled al-Falih said on Thursday [17 Sep 2015].

As pilgrims poured into Mecca from around the world, the Health Ministry said it had confirmed 2 more cases of the disease in Riyadh on Thursday [17 Sep 2015], but the number of cases has declined since last month [August 2015], Falih said.

Most medical staffers touring hospitals and medical centers around Mecca on Wednesday [16 Sep 2015] covered their noses and mouths with masks, as did traffic policemen and army personnel deployed to secure the flow of busses carrying pilgrims into the holy city.

"With the help of God and then with the measures taken by the ministry of health we hope to prevent the virus from getting to the pilgrims," said Falih in a news conference.

So far around 1.2 million Muslims have arrived in the kingdom for haj.

In past years it has drawn up to 3 million pilgrims, but authorities have limited numbers in the past 2 years because of construction work around the Grand Mosque.

Saudi Arabia has banned the slaughter of camels around the holy cities during the pilgrimage. The animals have been found to carry the virus and scientists say they are the most likely source of primary infections of people.

Seven people in the city of Medina who have been infected by MERS have been moved to Riyadh as a precaution to avoid any spread of the disease near the pilgrimage sites, Falih said.

"The spread has begun to shrink and we are optimistic the days of spreading are gone and are behind us," said Falih.

The kingdom has mobilized 25 000 medical staff from different cities into Mecca for the haj season.

[It is curious that a decision was made to transfer the MERS-CoV cases from the hospital in Madinah to another hospital in Riyadh. Of note there were an additional 2 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported from Madinah subsequent to the date covered in the above WHO update (reported on 13 and 14 Sep 2015), one of whom was a healthcare worker, bringing the total number of cases reported from Madinah since 7 Sep 2015 to 7. As a reminder, the "index" case in this nosocomial outbreak was case no. 12 in the above WHO update (section [2]). As 14 days have not passed since the most recent dates of onset of illness of the cases reported from Madinah, there is no guarantee that there aren't additional cases occurring in Madinah that may be related to this outbreak. Hence, if there is concern of possible transmission to Hajji's seeking health services in Madinah, one wonders if just transferring active cases will truly reduce the risk of exposure to MERS-CoV in the healthcare environment. - Mod.MPP
