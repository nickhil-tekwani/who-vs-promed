Larvae of a tropical mosquito found locally for the 1st time last fall at Navy Base San Diego and Chula Vista have been discovered in Escondido, the [San Diego] county Department of Environmental Health reported Thursday [5 Mar 2015]. A resident called to report the _Aedes aegypti_ larvae earlier this week, according to the department.

_Aedes aegypti_, also known as the "yellow fever" mosquito, is capable of carrying tropical diseases [viruses] like yellow fever, dengue fever and chikungunya, though the department cautions that there hasn't been an outbreak of yellow fever in the United States in more than 100 years.

_Aedes aegypti_ is black with white stripes. It was likely brought to the region by travelers and might have hitched a ride by car to the North County, according to the agency. That type of mosquito generally doesn't spread very quickly on its own, experts say.

The insect was found in southern areas of San Diego County in October [2014], but no evidence of the species was seen again until last week, when one was located in Chula Vista, close to one of the original discovery sites. "It's very important that we get the public to help fight to keep this mosquito out of the county by eliminating standing water," said Department of Environmental Health director Elizabeth Pozzebon. "This includes inside your home. This mosquito will live and breed indoors." The breed's preference for living indoors is one of the key differences from mosquitoes normally found locally. The other is that it will feed during the daytime. The regular mosquitoes bite around dusk and dawn.

County vector control teams have been putting up and monitoring traps for the aedes mosquito in the areas where it has been found and handing out information to urge the public to be on the lookout for the pest.

[The report of finding _Aedes aegypti_ in the north of San Diego county, relatively far away from the earlier findings in the south of the county, is a cause of legitimate concern, and county health official vector control teams are to be commended for their proactive surveillance efforts to detect and control this mosquito. Public cooperation is important but difficult to accomplish. Travelers who have been infected with dengue and chikungunya viruses arrive in California with some frequency. Should _Aedes aegypti_ populations become established, there is a real risk of ongoing transmission initiated by an incoming viremic individual. However, these viruses may not become endemic in southern California because of screens and air conditioning, and especially because of effective vector control that most areas in California have. However, the risk remains for sporadic introduction of these viruses with limited outbreaks.

These 3 counties in California where _Ae. aegypti_ has been found over the past 2 years illustrate 2 critical points; (1) the importance of ongoing surveillance to detect their presence very early on while they are still geographically limited, and (2) rapid response by vector control officials and the public. One hopes that the eradication efforts are successful.
