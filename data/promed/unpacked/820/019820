West Nile virus is widely distributed throughout Africa, Asia and Europe.
In Madagascar, West Nile virus has been isolated from human blood, birds
(parrots _Coracopsis vasa_, and egrets _Bulbicus ibis_) and from several
mosquito species (_Culex decens_, _Cx. quinquefasciatus_, _Cx.
tritaeniorhynchus_, _Cx. antennatus_, _Cx._ univittatus_, _Aedes
albocephalus_, _Ae. circumluteolus_, _Ae. aegypti_, _Ae. madagascarensis_,
_Anopheles brunnipes_, _An. maculipalpis_). Clinical syndrome classically
associated with West Nile infection of humans [manifests as an acute,
febrile illness. Encephalitis may be commun [i.e., more common than generally
recognized?.
In Central African Republic (1983), four cases of fatal hepatitis [due to
West Nile virus infection were confirmed by virus isolation from blood and
liver biopsies. Also in CAR, the virus has been isolated from several local
birds (brown-crowned tchagra, black-crowned waxbill) and several mosquito
genera (_Aedes_, _Culex_, and _Mansonia_).

[Thanks to Jacques Morvan for this additional information. I apologize for
not having posted this message sooner but I had been attempting to obtain,
for posting, whatever information my sources in Madagascar might be able to
provide regarding West Nile virus infection of lemurs. Not having received a
reply to my message, I can only conclude that I do not have sources in
Madagascar. Also, this series is named somewhat incorrectly. The virus is
West Nile virus. The fever it can cause is West Nile fever. It is incorrect
to say "West Nile fever virus", but I have continued this titling to keep
from confusing those who might do a TOPICS search. I have been trying to get
the world to do things my way for >60 years but have not yet been successful.
I will simply have to try harder. -- Mod CHC
