New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Fethard, Tipperary
Date of start of the outbreak: 12 May 2020
Outbreak status: resolved on 22 May 2020
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 9 / 1 / 1 / 8 / 0
Affected population: One case animal. There are 8 susceptible animals: 6 cohorts and 2 progeny. All susceptible animals were culled and tested negative for BSE.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 11.11 / 11.11 / 100 / 100
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: On [13 May 2020], the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) was advised of a positive result to a rapid screening test carried out by an accredited private laboratory approved by the competent authority. The suspect animal was sampled by DAFM staff as part of the ongoing official sampling of all fallen animals of 48 months and older. The sample material and brain were subsequently forwarded to the National Reference Laboratory (NRL) where samples from different brain areas were subject to confirmatory testing using an OIE-approved confirmatory western blot method, a 2-blot protocol for the classification of BSE isolates. All the samples had an identical molecular pattern indicating atypical H type BSE. In accordance with NRL protocols, samples from the animal were then sent for histopathology and immunohistochemistry on the medulla of the brain. Final confirmatory test results were received from the NRL on [22 May 2020] confirming the case to be atypical H type BSE.

The cow involved in this case was a 14-year-old Limousin cow born on [8 Mar 2006]. There are 73 cattle on the animal identification and movement register for the herd. The herd is a suckler herd. The cow remained in that herd until her death on Sat 9 May 2020. The cow had had a history of neurological signs, which were 1st noted at the end of March 2020, where the cow became ataxic and recumbent but got back on her feet with some assistance. A further such episode occurred in April 2020, and again on Sat 9 May 2020. The farmer intended to call his private veterinary surgeon (PVP) to look at the animal at that time, but she had died before he had the opportunity to call his PVP. The cow was well conditioned, up to her death.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; stamping out; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (National laboratory) / Cattle / histopathological examination / 19 May 2020 / Positive
Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (National laboratory) / Cattle / immunohistochemical test / 18 May 2020 / Positive
Central Veterinary Research Laboratory (National laboratory) / Cattle / Western blot / 19 May 2020 / Positive
Enfer laboratories (Private laboratory) / Cattle / rapid tests / 13 May 2020 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

["Atypical BSE occurs rarely and spontaneously, typically in cattle that are 8 years old or older. There is no association of atypical BSE with contaminated feed or ingestion of infected materials. Instead, a spontaneous change in the prion proteins in older adult cattle causes atypical BSE. Because changes in prion proteins are sporadic and very rare, scientists do not fully understand what causes prions to change from normal to abnormal forms.

Scientists are currently studying whether genetics or environmental factors may contribute to atypical BSE. As part of this research, scientists typically examine the offspring of animals diagnosed with atypical BSE and animals born in the same location at the same time as affected animals."

"The national BSE surveillance program in Ireland complies with the guidelines in Articles 11.4.20 to 11.4.22 of the OIE Terrestrial Code and with EU TSE Regulation 999/2001. The OIE have designated Ireland as a country with a "controlled" BSE risk. This status is based on a detailed risk analysis, awareness program, monitoring and surveillance program, and the history of BSE in the country.

The surveillance program is made up of 3 key components:
1. Active surveillance - casualty/emergency slaughter animals
All casualty or emergency cattle over the age of 48 months must be tested for BSE at slaughter.

2. Active Surveillance - fallen animals
All fallen animals (died on farm) over the age of 48 months must be sampled for BSE at collection centres.

3. Passive surveillance
All cattle displaying behavioral or clinical signs consistent with BSE and where BSE cannot be ruled out must be tested for BSE following euthanasia/death (clinical suspects).

The surveillance program is a national program in line with EU legislation requirements. Samples are taken by DAFM approved officers and are tested at DAFM approved laboratories.

The purpose of the surveillance program is to ensure public safety and animal health by preventing BSE-affected animals from entering the human food chain or animal feed chain."

Cases of atypical BSE do not impact the official BSE risk status of a country; therefore, this detection will not change the controlled risk status of Ireland. - Mod.CRD
