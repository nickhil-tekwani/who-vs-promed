Repeated tests carried out in a wild boar shot in Zwickau [Cvikov], Marenicky area in the Ceska Lípa district [map at http://tinyurl.com/jk4kmu2], revealed infection with the parasite _Trichinella spiralis_, the cause of trichinosis which is transmissible to humans. The tests were confirmed by the State Veterinary Institute in Prague, said Miroslav Kurfurst, Director of the regional veterinary administration of the Liberec Region (KVSL).

Immediately after receiving the results, the regional veterinary administration contacted the hunters and ensured that the meat of the positive boar was not consumed. Extraordinary measures have been applied in the territory of Marenice, where the infected wild boar was caught.

Kurfust indicated that each harvested or slaughtered susceptible animal must, according to the law, be tested for the presence of the parasite _Trichinella_ before being put into circulation, and released only after the receipt of negative test results.

He added: "A person can be infected by eating raw or undercooked meat of animals that include encapsulated larvae of the parasitic worm.

The signs appearing following the ingestion of the parasite include muscular pains caused by migrating larvae, accompanied by severe flu-like symptoms, swelling of the face and difficulty in breathing. After encapsulation of the larvae the disease is difficult to treat, it consists only in mitigating inflammatory and immune responses.

The most frequent host of the parasite, dangerous to humans, are pigs, wild and domestic, rodents, foxes or even a badger. The horse is also receptive to the parasite. Clinical signs in affected animals are observed".

Regional Veterinary Administration warns all to be cautious when buying meat from wild animals susceptible to trichinosis.

"The last finding of trichinosis, in the Liberec region, took place in 2012 in the Semily hunting grounds in Paseky nad Jizerou," says Miroslav Kurfürst.

[Trichinellosis is a zoonotic disease, included in OIE's list. The following summary is derived from OIE's manual (chapter 2.1.16, updated 2012):

"Trichinellosis in humans is caused by eating raw or undercooked meat from _Trichinella_-infected domestic animals, or game. Animals become infected by feeding on _Trichinella_-infected muscles.

Ingested infective larvae mature and mate in the small intestine of host species including humans, pigs, rats, bears, walruses, horses (occasionally) and many other flesh-eating mammals, and birds and reptiles. The adult worms survive less than 2 months. The larvae produced migrate and persist in the muscles of their hosts. Susceptible new hosts become infected by ingestion of muscle tissue that contains these larvae.

Identification of the agent: Tests for detecting _Trichinella_ spp. fall into 2 categories:
1) direct detection of first-stage larvae encysted or free in striated muscle tissue, and
2) indirect detection of infection by tests for specific antibodies.

Tissue digestion and tissue compression methods have been used for the direct detection of _Trichinella_ larvae in tissues. _Trichinella_ larvae usually localise in preferred muscle sites, particularly in low-level infections, and these sites may vary by host species. It is important that preferred sites be sampled to maximise test sensitivity. For example, in pigs, the diaphragm (crus) and tongue muscles are the 2 most preferred sites, whereas in horses, the tongue harbours the most worms, followed by the masseter, diaphragm and neck muscles.

The artificial digestion methods involve enzymatic digestion of individual or pooled muscle tissue samples incorporating mechanical homogenisation or grinding, stirring, and incubation. This is followed by filtration and sedimentation procedures to recover and concentrate any larvae that are released from muscle during digestion. Samples processed by these methods are examined under a stereomicroscope for the presence of larvae. Digestion tests can detect [less than] 1 larva per gram (lpg) of tissue, but at these low levels of infection, uneven distribution of larvae within tissues is a limiting factor. This is compensated for by testing larger samples per carcass, such as a minimum of 3-5 g for pigs and 5-10 g for horses, game and indicator wildlife species such as foxes. Digestion methods are recommended for the inspection of individual carcass of food animals such as pigs, horses and game.

The compression method (trichinoscopy) is less sensitive than artificial digestion and is not recommended as a reliable test for inspection of carcasses for either food safety or disease surveillance.

Serological tests: Serological assays are the most common tests used for indirect detection. The sensitivity and specificity of serological methods are mainly dependent upon the type and quality of antigen used. Most serological test performance (validation) data are from pigs. False negative serological results may occur 3 weeks or longer after muscle larvae become infective in pigs with light or moderate infections. A low rate of false-positive results has also been reported for serological tests. For surveillance or verification of _Trichinella_-free herds or regions, serological methods are acceptable.

For the purposes of individual carcass inspection, only direct methods can be recommended. Pigs harbouring as few as one larva/100 g of tissue have been detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The specificity of ELISA for _Trichinella_ infection is directly linked to the type and quality of the antigen employed in the test. Secretory antigens collected by short-term (18-20 hours) maintenance of _T. spiralis_ muscle larvae in vitro and synthetic carbohydrate antigens currently provide the most specific and economical source. It is critical that appropriate positive and negative control sera be used to ensure that ELISAs are performing at a minimum acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity. The digestion of 100 g or more of tissue is recommended as a confirmatory test for serologically positive animals."

Cases of trichinellosis are detected every year in wildlife in the Czech Republic, similarly to every country performing surveillance in wildlife, particularly wild boars. During 2014, a total of 10 cases were reported. According to the most recent available periodic report to the OIE, the semi-annual report covering Jan - Jun 2015, 5 cases were reported, including 3 red foxes and 2 wild boars. - Mod.AS
