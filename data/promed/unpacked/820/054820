West Nile virus in the United States - WHO Update 4
-------------------------------------------------
As of Mon 23 Sep 2002, the WHO Collaborating Centre for Arthropod Borne
Viruses -- Western Hemisphere, at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) has reported 1963 human cases of West Nile virus
infection, with 94 deaths occurring in 32 states and the District of Columbia.

During 2002, West Nile virus activity evidence of infections in birds,
humans, mosquitoes, and other animals (primarily horses) has been
documented in 42 states and the District of Columbia. For more information
about this outbreak see the CDC web site:

West Nile Virus Human Death toll Reaches 94: Joint Congressional Meeting
-------------------------------------------------
The number of deaths linked to West Nile virus infection in the United
States this year has risen to 94, and nearly 2000 people have been
diagnosed with it, federal health officials said on Tue 24 Sep 2002. On
Tuesday 2 congressional committees will hold a joint hearing to look into
the challenges the virus presents to public health. The panels will hear
from top health officials, including Dr. Julie Gerberding, Director of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director
of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

The CDC said on Tuesday that 1963 people have been diagnosed with West Nile
virus in the United States so far in 2002. Illinois has had the most
deaths, with 25. Louisiana and Michigan have had 11 each.

Health officials said they suspect tens of thousands of people nationwide
have contracted West Nile virus, but most cases are never diagnosed. Most
people experience few or no symptoms. About one in 150 people who contract
West Nile virus infection develops encephalitis or meningitis. Those cases
generally involve older people and those with weakened immune systems. In
those instances, the [infection] can prove fatal. Health officials also
have determined the virus can cause paralysis. Mosquitoes carry the virus,
but the CDC has said it appears likely that some people contracted West
Nile virus through organ transplants and blood transfusions. Blood banks
are taking special precautions to try to weed out donors who may have
symptoms of the virus.

Second Long Island Resident Dies of West Nile Virus Infection
-----------------------------------------------
A 72-year-old Huntington man who was diagnosed with West Nile virus while
visiting Michigan in August 2002 died from the illness on 13 Sep 2002,
Suffolk County [New York state] health officials said yesterday. The man,
whose name was not released, was the second Long Islander to die from the
virus this year. The first, a Melville resident aged 81, died on 19 Aug
2002. There have been a total of 12 cases disclosed by health officials on
Long Island this year. Of those, 7 have been in Nassau and 5 in Suffolk.

The Huntington man's symptoms began on 17 Aug 2002, 2 days after he arrived
in Michigan, Suffolk Health Department spokeswoman Millie Dinda said
yesterday. It usually takes 5 to 15 days for symptoms to appear after a
person is infected, experts say. Before his trip to Michigan, he had
traveled to Boston and returned to Huntington on 4 Aug 2002, where he
stayed until 15 Aug 2002, Dinda said. The health department said it was not
possible to ascertain where he contracted the disease.

On 17 Aug 2002, he started developing symptoms, including confusion and
muscle weakness. By 30 Aug 2002, he had slipped into a coma, and he
remained in a coma in a Michigan hospital until he died on 13 Sep 2002.
Suffolk County officials initially announced the man's infection on 12 Sep
2002, when they incorrectly gave his age as 75. Dinda said yesterday that
the county health department did not learn of the man's death until 16 Sep
2002.

West Nile Virus Latest News as of Mon 23 Sep 2002
-----------------------------------------------
West Nile Virus (WNV) has crossed the continental divide: WNV has been
detected on both sides of the divide in Colorado and is confirmed in
California, on the Pacific Coast, and in Nova Scotia, Canada, on the
Atlantic coast. On Fri 20 Sep 2002, the Nova Scotia Department of Health
confirmed WNV in a blue jay found in Dartmouth, and announced a presumptive
positive crow found in Kingston on 26 Aug 2002. (These locations are NE of
Maine, the furthest east that WNV has been detected in North America,
approximately at the 65th meridian). Across the continent, the California
Department of Heath Services confirmed on 12 Sep 2002 that a woman from Los
Angeles Co was exposed to WNV in state. Ongoing surveillance throughout
California since 2000 had not detected WNV in mosquitoes, birds, or other
animals, the typical "early warnings" that have preceded detection of human
cases in other places. Since the woman has not recently travelled out of
state, her case is the first reported in California. It was first announced
6 Sep 2002 as "probable." In many states it has been detected in all, or
nearly all, counties.

The number of equine cases has seen an upsurge, with at least 5380 cases
reported to USDA APHIS by state health officials in 33 states as of 17 Sep
2002. This compares with 3453 cases reported from 30 states on 8 Sep 2002.
WNV has now been associated with illness and death in several other mammal
species, including squirrel, wolf and dog in Illinois (which leads the
country in number of human cases) and mountain goat and sheep in Nebraska
(which leads the country in numbers of equine cases). University of
Minnesota's Raptor Center reports increasing numbers of raptors picked up
sick or dead, infected with WNV but perhaps also with other confounding
disease.

Labor Day Weekend 2002 brought news of another risk related to WNV, with a
growing body of evidence that the virus can be transmitted via organ
transplant from an infected person (and an associated risk that it might
also be transmitted by blood transfusion). By end of the first week of
September 2002, the CDC confirmed with a high level of certainty that the
organs from an infected donor had transmitted the infection to 4 organ
recipients.

Research to determine if WNV can also be transmitted via blood transfusion
was prompted by trying to understand how the organ donor had become
infected, since blood tests before she received blood transfusions did not
show she was WNV-positive, while later tests did. Interest was spurred when
it was learned that at least 4 other people have been diagnosed with WNV
infection after receiving blood transfusions. Although
transfusion-associated transmission "is highly suspicious," the current
investigations involve people from areas with high levels of WNV activity,
so the evidence thus far is not conclusive. One of the 7 related
investigations detailed by CDC in the has shown that WNV can survive in
some blood components (likely for several days) and probably can be
transmitted by transfusion. Another of the investigations has shown that
not all recipients of WNV-contaminated units will become infected with WNV.

While evidence that WNV can be transmitted through blood transfusions adds
a wrinkle to the set of assumptions about disease transmission, the general
population is at no greater risk of contracting WNV than previously
thought. The news does make us aware that a sub-population of people about
to undergo high risk organ transplants and/or receive blood transfusions
(about 4.5 million persons in the US receive blood or blood products
annually) may be at still greater health risk due to the increased risk of
contracting WNV.

However, CDC health officials point out that the additional risk of
contracting WNV is quite small in comparison with the much larger risks
from these medical procedures. The process of donating blood poses no risk
to the blood donor for contracting WNV. Related to these investigations,
research is also underway to develop more rapid tests for determining
whether asymptomatic people are infected with WNV. Such a test could enable
screening for WNV in donated blood. However, in a 19 Sep 2002 press
briefing it was noted (a) that screening would be quite difficult because
there would be relatively small amounts of the virus in blood of an
asymptomatic infected person; and (b) it would be necessary to detect the
virus itself, not antibodies the body produces in response to infection.

The number of lab-positive human cases of WNV-associated illness is
continuing to increase in 2002, with CDC reporting 1963 confirmed or
probable cases as of Mon 23 Sep 2002 (94 fatalities) in 32 states (North
Carolina having reported its first-ever human case) and Washington DC. This
compares with 1745 cases (84 fatalities) in 31 states reported 19 Sep; 1295
cases (54 fatalities) in 30 states reported 12 Sep; 954 cases (43
fatalities) in 29 states reported 6 Sep; 737 cases (40 fatalities) in 28
states reported 4 Sep; 555 cases (28 fatalities) in 26 states reported 29
Aug; 480 cases (24 fatalities) in 22 states reported 28 Aug; 425 cases (20
fatalities) in 20 states reported 27 Aug; 371 cases (16 fatalities) in 20
states reported 23 Aug; 296 cases (14 fatalities) in 17 states reported 22
Aug; 210 cases reported 21 Aug; and 156 cases reported 14 Aug 2002.

[2] West Nile Virus Activity; Michigan 1 Jan to 24 Sep 2002
-------------------------------------------------
During the period 1 Jan to 24 Jan 2002, the Michigan Department of
Community Health (MDCH) identified 270 persons with laboratory evidence of
WNV infection; 236 cases were laboratory confirmed and 34 were probable.
Thirteen cases were fatal; all 13 presented with either encephalitis or
aseptic meningitis.

The 270 patients had a median age of 61 years (range: 9 months to 91
years); 157 (58 percent) were male. Of the 215 patients for whom clinical
information was available, 184 (86 percent) had aseptic meningitis or
encephalitis. The median age of these 184 cases was 67 years (range: 9
months to 91 years). Median age of decedents was 79 years (range: 42 to 90
years). Date of illness onset for all cases was 29 Jul to 12 Sep 2002.

Of Michigan's 83 counties, 68 (82 percent) have reported WNV activity
(positive animal, mosquito, or human cases). Human cases have occurred
among persons in 13 counties, with 256 cases (95 percent), including all 13
deaths, occurring in the state's 4 most populous counties (Kent [35],
Macomb [42], Oakland [104], and Wayne [75]). Of 580 birds tested, 324 (56
percent) from 67 counties have tested positive for WNV by
immunohistochemistry test and confirmatory polymerase chain reaction at
state public health laboratories; the first bird tested positive on 24 May
2002. A total of 145 horses from 30 counties have tested laboratory
positive. The first horse tested positive on 16 Aug 2002.
