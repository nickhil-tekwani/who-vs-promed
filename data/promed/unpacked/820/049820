From 1 July [2017], 118 people have been killed to the present date in Brazil by the yellow fever, out of a total of 407 cases infected by the disease throughout the country, said the Ministry of Health.

The states with the highest death toll are Sao Paulo (46 fatalities and 183 confirmed cases), Minas Gerais (44 fatalities and 157 cases) and Rio de Janeiro (27 fatalities and 68 cases), said the ministry while reiterating that in the same period of 2017, the disease claimed 166 lives and totaled 532 cases.

In a preliminary report issued today [Fri 16b Feb 2018], the Ministry of Health regretted that the ongoing vaccination campaign does not achieve the expected results.

So far, 3 950 000 people have been vaccinated in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, which represents only 19.5 percent of the population expected to be immunized in the Southeast region of the country (20 500 000 people).

The ministry said that since last year [2017] and until the present date, more than 64 million doses of the vaccine were sent to the states, the vast majority of which (54 300 000) were sent to Sao Paulo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Espirito Santo and Bahia.

[The number of yellow fever (YF) cases continues to slowly climb. The YF vaccination campaign in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states is underway, but apparently proceeding more slowly than expected. A 15 Feb 2018 report stated that Brazil's Health Ministry indicated that a massive yellow fever vaccination campaign has reached less than 20 percent of the targeted population since it began 3 weeks ago (http://www.wilx.com/content/news/Brazil-experience-yellow-fever-outbreak-474220583.html). Fortunately, the YF urban transmission cycle with _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito vectors is not responsible for any of the YF cases in Brazil. None-the-less completion of the goals of the vaccination campaigns in these states is urgent, to avoid any spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle going on currently to the urban cycle.

This Friday [16 Feb 2018] the death of a Chilean was reported, who was hospitalized in intensive care in Rio de Janeiro, afte having been infected with yellow fever. The individual involved is a 35 year old man who thus became the 1st Chilean victim of this disease.

This information was confirmed from Chile by his sister who also confirmed that the man was an "anti vaccine" person who considred that this preventive medical method was a "game" of the state.

The man was in Brazil since 29 Dec [2017], the date of his arrival on vacation with his girlfriend with the intention of staying on Isla Grande.

According to what the dead man's sister said, this was one of the man's favorite places since it presented a "total disconnection" from the communication media and the technology of the modern world. Also, the young man had traveled there 2 times before so he could be a kind of guide for his companion, to show her places in this country.

The man's father tried to advise his son about yellow fever, but the message was only read by his companion when the disease was already advanced and with symptoms.

[Unfortunately, this fatal case illustrates the risk run by individuals who refuse vaccination for whatever reason, in this case believing that it is a game of the government. He traveled to a place of active yellow fever transmission and paid with his life for this belief.

ProMED-mail thanks Drs. David Hamer and Patricia Schlagenhauf of the GeoSentinel Tracking and Communications Working Group. They report an additional case YF case. Prof. Eric Caumes from one of 2 Paris GeoSentinel sites reported on 14 Feb 2018, a patient with yellow fever after travel to Brazil. This was a 42-year old, unvaccinated woman who had traveled to Brumadinho in Minas Gerais for purposes of tourism and visiting friends and relatives. During her trip, she visited the Inhotim Botanical Garden, a potential yellow fever risk area. The patient's diagnosis was initially made in Brazil and the patient was seen after return in Paris during convalescence. During this woman's acute illness in Brazil, she was hospitalized in a local clinic. She presented with hepatitis, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. The diagnosis of yellow fever was confirmed by a YF blood PCR at a national referral center and positive IgM. She has recovered fully without any sequelae.

Drs. David Hamer and Patricia Schlagenhauf point out that this is the 2nd case of yellow fever ex-Brazil to be reported to GeoSentinel sites in Europe this year [2018]. The 1st GeoSentinel case was notified by Dr. Perry van Genderen, from the Rotterdam site, in January this year [2018] and was posted on ProMED. Both these cases illustrate the utility of the GeoSentinel database in confirming that travelers are sentinels for the expanding yellow fever outbreak situation in Brazil. The cases also highlight the importance of YF vaccination for travelers to outbreak areas. For those advising travelers in a pre-travel setting, the WHO expanded yellow fever vaccination recommendations for Brazil and strict adherence to day/evening-time mosquito bite protection measures should be observed. - Mod.TY]

[3] Vaccination at gun point

https://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Brazilian-Gang-Held-Nurses-Hostage-To-Vaccinate-Rio-Favela-20180214-0035.html


A wanted drug dealer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil kidnapped medical staff so that his community could be vaccinated against the current crisis of yellow fever in the country, local media reported.

The drug dealer, also known as 2N, kidnapped 2 male nurses from the Itauna vaccination post, along with his gang. The group took as many syringes and vaccine doses as they could find, then transported the nurses and equipment to one of the poorest favelas [slums] in Rio de Janeiro, Salgueiro.

The gang then watched over as the nurses administered vaccines to the community over the course of 2 hours. The nurses were driven back to their workplace after they were done.

In their report, the 2 health workers said the kidnappers were not aggressive, saying they only carried out their actions because many in the Salgueiro pueblo were not able to visit immunization centers to get their yellow fever shot.

News of the gang's action went viral last week [week of Sun 4 Feb 2018]on social media, with 2N praised as a "modern-day Robin Hood."

State deputy Carlos Minc, a former Minister of Environment under Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's presidency, also took to Twitter to comment that the act was a "public service."

The Municipal Health Secretariat of Rio de Janeiro has said they will open an administrative process to investigate the incident.

[This is a novel approach to accomplishing vaccination goals, even though it doubtless made the vaccinating nurses nervous. Perhaps the vaccination centers need to be moved into the favelas. Vaccination of the favela populations is important, as the populations of _Aedes aegypti_ YF virus vectors are abundant there.
