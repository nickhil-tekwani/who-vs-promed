Just a note to remind readers that the USDA has just published its major
risk assessment monograph on _Salmonella enteriditis_ in shell eggs. It can
be found at:
<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/ophs/risk/contents.htm>
Salient points include:
1. 1:20,000 eggs is contaminated in the shell.
2. It is projected that each such egg has a 25% chance of giving rise to
illness, chiefly due to the chance of under cooking.
3. It is believed 80% of all Salmonella cases in the US are caused by shell
eggs.
4. Apparently human-food is a very minor source, and the old bugaboo of
poultry [?meat pales beside eggs as a source of illnesses.
