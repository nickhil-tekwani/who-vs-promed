High incidence of CCHF predicted for southern Russia
----------------------------------------------------
Spread of of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been observed in
recent years throughout southern Russia and Rospotrebnadzor (The Agency for
Protection of Consumer Affairs) is predicting a worsening of the situation
in 2008.

The agency reports that from 1999 to 2007 outbreaks of CCHF were recorded
in 7 out of 13 territories in the Southern Federal Okrug. More than 90 per
cent of cases have occurred in rural situations, where the population is
engaged in farming and agriculture. The urban population is exposed to
infection only when visiting summer cottages. All age groups are affected
but those between 20 and 60 years are at greatest risk. The infection as a
rule happens as the result of a tick bite or during handling ticks without
proper protection.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is caused by infection with a tickborne
virus (belonging to the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family _Bunyaviridae_.
The disease was first characterized in the Crimea in 1944 and given the
name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later recognized in 1969 as the
cause of illness in the Congo, thus resulting in the current name of the
disease. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is found in Eastern Europe,
particularly in the south of the former Soviet Union. It is also
distributed throughout the Mediterranean, in north western China, central
Asia, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent.
