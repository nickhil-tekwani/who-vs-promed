FOOT AND MOUTH DISEASE IN PARAGUAY: Laboratory results transmitted by
the Pan-American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center
(Date of previous reported outbreak: September 1994).
Translation of information received on 4 November 2002 from Dr
Eduardo Correa Melo, Director of the Pan-American Foot-and-Mouth
Disease Center, Pan American Health Organization:
End of previous report period: 29 October 2002 (see Disease
Information, 15 [44], 222, dated 1 November 2002).
End of this report period: 4 November 2002.
The Pan American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Center (OIE Reference
Laboratory for FMD) informs the OIE Central Bureau that foot and
mouth disease virus type O has been isolated from samples of bovine
oesophageal-pharyngeal fluid collected in Canindeyu Department,
Paraguay.
NOTE BY THE OIE CENTRAL BUREAU

samples collected in Canindeyu Department, the status of "FMD free
country with vaccination" of Paraguay is suspended with effect from 4

[Even though it has taken a while to sort out this situation, OIE is
to be congratulated for providing full and transparent information as
it comes through their reporting and laboratory systems. In this
case, OIE has been an excellent source of reliable information and
appropriate action.
It is extremely important that neighboring countries and trading
partners become aware of an outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease as
soon as possible in order to prevent further spread. Unfortunately,
such simple actions are not always implemented, either this time or
in the 2000 outbreak in Paraguay. Fortunately, we got to the bottom
of this faster than we would have 10 years ago, prior to OIE
revamping its information systems and the advent of the Internet. -
