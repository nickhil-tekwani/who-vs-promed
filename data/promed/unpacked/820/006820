The Public Health Inspectorate and the Insect Vector Control Division of
the Ministry of Health have heightened their campaign against mosquitoes in
the wake of another outbreak of dengue fever. Through 11 October sources
at the Ministry of Health have confirmed 109 cases of dengue from 743
reported cases throughout the country. This was compared to the same
period last year, in which there were 2,108 reported cases, 358 confirmed.
Ministry of Health officials said there was no cause for concern. They
noted that although there were many cases of dengue in the country every
year, only a few people die from the disease.
The latest victim was [a 39-year old female resident of] San Fernando. She
died at the San Fernando General Hospital on Saturday and was buried
yesterday. A post mortem conducted at the hospital revealed that the
patient died from Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF)/peritoneal haemorrhage
with shock. The Ministry has appointed a three-man team to investigate her
death; the team is to report to the Health Minister in ten days.
So far this year, St George West has had the most confirmed cases of dengue
(49), followed by St George Central, 17, and St George East, 15. Caroni
had six confirmed cases and Victoria, the area in which the patient lived,
had two.
In 1995, there were 59 confirmed cases in the country and 15 of those came
from County Victoria. In 1996, there were 242 confirmed cases of dengue,
with 12 cases in County Victoria.
Officials at the Princes Town Regional Corporation said they began a Source
Reduction Programme to get rid of adult mosquitoes from high-risk areas
such as Lengua and Sixth Company, Moruga.
A similar programme has been started by the Penal/Debe Regional Corporation
in collaboration with the Insect Vector Division. Both corporations are
also conducting education programmes.
The San Fernando City Medical Officer said the Public Health Department
usually carried out fogging to kill adult mosquitoes. The department also
conducted educational programmes to enlighten the public on dengue and
other diseases. He maintained there were no confirmed cases of dengue in
San Fernando.

[Allow me to present my humble opinion about this newspaper report.
Although we are indebted to the marvelous Les Spence for sending this
message, I would rather have cut it to 2-3 sentences. No one expects
local newspapers to get the story completely right but this one is
ridiculous. There are so many diametrically opposed statements I did not
know which ones to cut, so I just straightened the edges and left the rest.
Clearly there is dengue in Trinidad and Tobago and an adult has died of
dengue hemorrhagic fever. Beyond that, it is difficult to say just what is
the situation. I am not at all impressed with the statement that there are
many cases of dengue each year and that "only a few people die from the
disease". Sounds to me like Trinidad and Tobago could be warming up to a
very bad situation. This will depend on the variation in dengue viruses
(types) and the sequence in which they appear but I hope someone is not
minimizing the situation and will keep an eye on it for us and for the
residents of those wonderful islands. - Mod. CHC]
