State marine patrol officers helped gather a dead manatee and a
dolphin today near Kelly Park in Merritt Island [Florida], the latest
apparent casualties of red tide.
Tissue tests would have to confirm red tide as the cause of death.
The manatee was found in Sykes Creek near Merritt Island High and the
dolphin was found in the Indian River in the Merritt Island area.
Through the end of November [2007], red tide killed at least 46
manatees this year in Florida, including 2 in Brevard County --
discounting the one reported today [28 Dec 2007] that is a suspected
red tide death -- and 2 in Volusia County.
Tests on another 5 suspected red tide-induced manatee deaths from the
Brevard County area are pending, said Lenny Salberg, an officer with
the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
Water samples have tested at high concentrations in the Mosquito
Lagoon in recent weeks.
More water sampling results are expected this afternoon [28 Dec 2007].
At least 9 dolphins are also suspected to have died from the red tide
off Brevard area beaches this month [December 2007].
While red tide can kill manatees, dolphins, and other mammals, health
officials say it does not pose an urgent public health threat to
humans. It can cause varying degrees of eye, nose, and throat
irritation, including a sore throat and cough similar to the common
cold.
Symptoms usually vanish shortly after leaving the beach but can last
for days in people with chronic or severe respiratory conditions such
as emphysema or asthma.

[Manatees are migratory aquatic mammals adapted to both saltwater and
freshwater habitats. Off the USA, West Indian manatees (_Trichechus
manatus_) are concentrated in Florida in the winter. In the summer
months, they can be found as far west as Alabama and as far north as
Virginia and the Carolinas -- very rarely, even further north.
Antillean manatees (_Trichechus manatus manatus_) live along the
coastal waters of Mexico, Central America, and the upper northern
coast of South America from Venezuela to Brazil. They can also be
found around islands of Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, and
Puerto Rico. The closely related Amazonian manatee (_Trichechus
inunguis_) is found in the River Amazon and its tributaries in
northern Brazil. The Amazonian manatee is the smallest of the 3
manatee species and lives exclusively in freshwater habitats. A few
still live in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. The West African manatee
(_Trichechus senegalensis_) is found across the Atlantic in the
tropical and sub-tropical waters of equatorial Africa from Senegal to
Angola.
These gentle mammals have been nicknamed 'sea cows'.
Manatees and dugongs are marine mammals of the order Sirenia. They
originated in the middle Eocene period around 45 to 50 million years
ago. They are gentle, plant-eating herbivores sometimes nicknamed
"sea cows." The name manatee comes from the Haitian word 'manati'.
Today, their closest living relatives are elephants [Proboscideans],
hyraxes [Hyracoidea] and aardvarks [Tubulidentata]. Manatees are
classified as [sub-]ungulates, even though they live in the water.
Their thick-skinned, streamlined, almost hairless bodies have
forelimbs modified into flippers. The tail is enlarged and
horizontally-flattened.
Swimming speeds of up to 20 mph have been recorded, but normally
manatees prefer to cruise at speeds of at 2-6 mph (3.2-9.7 km/h).
They will typically surface to breathe through their nostrils every 3
to 5 minutes. When they are using a great deal of energy, however,
manatees may surface for air as often as every 30 seconds. They can
stay submerged for up to 15-20 minutes.
Manatees have a slow reproductive rate. Twins are rare; when they do
occur, one calf is suckled on each nipple, located just behind each
of the flippers. More normally, one calf is born every 2-5 years. At
birth, the calf is around 3-4 feet (0.9-1.2 m) long. Guided by the
mother, it swims to the surface to breathe. The newborn calf weighs
about 60-70 pounds (27-32 kg). It starts suckling -- underwater -- a
few hours after birth.
The manatee gestation period is over a year, usually around 13
months. Mothers nurse their young for a long period. When they swim
together, the baby may hold onto the mother's back with its tiny
flippers. The calf will remain dependent on its mother for up to 2
years. Mother and calf communicate by continual chirps and squeaks.
The calf starts eating plants after a few weeks old; it is born with
molar and pre-molar teeth. Female manatees are sexually mature by
around 6-7 years; males by perhaps 9 years.

Red tide is caused by several toxic algae. Depending upon the toxin,
it is also known as paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), because it
causes shellfish to be toxic for consumption.
PSP is a significant problem in several geographic areas, especially
in both the east and the west coasts of the US. Produced by several
closely related species in the genus _Alexandrium_, PSP toxins are
responsible for persistent problems due to their accumulation in
filter-feeding shellfish; but they also move through the food chain,
affecting zooplankton, fish larvae, adult fish, and even birds and
marine mammals.
_Alexandrium_ blooms generally do not involve large-cell
accumulations that discolor the water and may instead be invisible
below the water surface. Low-density populations can cause severe
problems due to the high potency of the toxins produced. Furthermore,
_Alexandrium_ spp. can grow in relatively pristine waters, and it is
difficult to argue that anthropogenic nutrient inputs are stimulating
the blooms. These characteristics are important when considering
mitigation and control strategies.
Often PSP is associated with red tides or algal blooms. Red tide is
caused by an organism called _Karenia brevis_, which in high
concentration can make the water look red. The organism releases a
toxin that paralyzes the respiratory system of fish and other marine
life.
Airborne toxins, water spray, and splashes in an outbreak have kept
people from beaches while leaving others with irritated eyes and
throats. Red tide irritates the skin of people exposed to it and can
cause itchy eyes, scratchy throats, and coughs. Harvesting from
affected areas for personal consumption is discouraged. Red tide
poisoning symptoms include nausea and dizziness and may last for
several days.
Previously the organism causing red tide was known as _Gymnodinium
breve_, but it has been reclassified in the taxonomy of
dinoflagellates. Its new name is _Karenia brevis_, or _K. brevis_.
Karenia was chosen in honor of Dr Karen Steidinger, a prominent red
tide scientist from the Florida Marine Research Institute in St.
Petersburg, Florida. The red tide update website can be accessed at
