Agency Takes Further Precautionary Measures on Risk of BSE in Sheep
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The Food Standards Agency has recommended to the European
Commission that sheep intestine should be banned from food use on a
Europe-wide basis as a precautionary measure against the theoretical
risk of BSE in sheep. The Agency takes the view that although this is a
theoretical risk it has to be considered in the context of the possible
human health impact of vCJD should BSE be present in sheep.
The proposed ban, added to the current controls, could reduce
potential infectivity entering the food chain by up to 2/3rds if BSE were
to be found in sheep. Current precautionary measures are estimated to
reduce risk by very approximately 1/3rd.
The measure is subject to EU-wide agreement. Until such a decision is
taken, it remains legal to buy and sell natural lamb sausage casings.
Most sausages in the UK use artificial casings. About 15 percent of the
sausages sold use sheep intestine and they are usually sold at higher
prices than sausages using artificial casings. Alternative natural or
artificial casings are available should sheep casings be banned.
The Agency has accepted the current risk assessment that, were BSE to
be found in sheep, infectivity would be greater in mutton, the intestine
and lymph nodes. The Agency accepted that banning intestine was
practical and proportionate to the risk, and the removal of lymph nodes
was rejected as being too costly and difficult to achieve.
The Agency has agreed to take forward further measures to protect and
inform consumers about the theoretical risk of BSE in sheep. These
include:
- communicating the higher theoretical risk of infectivity in mutton and
goat to those communities -- Muslim and Afro-Caribbean -- that are
most likely to be affected;
- seeking agreement with baby food manufacturers for voluntary
"country of origin" labelling on lamb products coupled with
information from the EU on the sheep-BSE risk from different
countries, to enable maximum choice for parents;
- supporting the acceleration of the national scrapie plan to eliminate
TSEs (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies);
- commissioning a full audit on the uses of sheep and goat products.
There is a theoretical risk of BSE in sheep because:
- sheep ate the same feed that gave cattle BSE;
- it has been shown that sheep can be artificially infected with BSE;
- it is possible that BSE is hidden by scrapie in sheep and passed
between flocks or from a mother to her lambs.
Although BSE has never been found in the UK sheep flock, only a
small number of scrapie affected sheep -- some 200 -- have been tested
with the most effective test available.
Sir John Krebs, chairman of the Food Standards Agency, said: "The
Board has looked carefully at the issues involved, which are
surrounded by considerable scientific uncertainty. When considering
measures to protect the public against the appalling consequences of
vCJD, the Board felt it was right to recommend practical and
proportionate measures that could significantly reduce the risk, even
though it remains a theoretical one."
"We have deliberately taken a precautionary approach. We are not
advising against the consumption of sheepmeat. Until, and unless there
is European agreement, buying and selling sausage casings made from
sheep intestine remains legal. However, consumers have a right to
know that, if BSE were present in sheep, their risk could be
significantly reduced by avoiding sausages made with natural lamb
casings and avoiding mutton."
Pre-packed sausages should be labelled with a description of the
sausage skin, and consumers can ask their butchers if they are buying
loose sausages. Lamb and mutton should always be labelled if sold pre-
packed or loose. There is no requirement for caterers to label sausage
skins, or declare whether [sausage] meat is lamb or mutton.
Notes to editors
1. The Agency announced at its Board meeting on 22 Oct 2001 that it
planned to review existing precautionary measures against the
theoretical risk of BSE in sheep. A public stakeholder meeting was held
on 18 Dec 2001 where it was announced that a core stakeholder group
would further consider the issue and put their findings to the FSA
Board. The BSE and Sheep Stakeholder Report was published on 23
May 2002 for public consultation.
2. The report and responses from the public consultation were
considered by the FSA Board at its open meeting on 13 Jun 2002. The
Board agreed to accept the recommendations in the Report.
3. The parts of sheep currently specified as specified risk material
(SRM) under EU legislation are:
- all sheep: spleen;
- sheep over 12 months of age (ie with one permanent incisor): the
skull (including brain and eyes), spinal cord and tonsils.
4. In a paper presented to the core stakeholder group, the Meat and
Livestock Commission estimated that the loss of natural sheep sausage
casings sales ex-abattoir would be 6.5 million UK pounds [approx.] per
year.
