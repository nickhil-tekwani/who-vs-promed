Number of Vesicular Stomatitis Found in Horses in Arizona Increases from 3
to 11
-------------------------------------------------
The Arizona Department of Agriculture has confirmed 11 cases of Vesicular
Stomatitis in horses throughout Arizona. This comes nearly a month after
the 1st case was confirmed on 20 Apr 2005. These premises have all been
quarantined. The following is a list of areas where these cases exist:
1. Camp Verde, 4 premises
2. Wickenburg, 1 premise
3. Wittmann , 2 premises
4. Sedona, 1 premise
5. Dewey, 1 premise
6. Cottonwood, 1 premise
7. Kirkland, 1 premise
This disease causes blister-like lesions to form in the mouth and on the
dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves, and teats. These blisters swell
and break, leaving raw tissue that is so painful that infected animals
generally refuse to eat or drink and show signs of lameness.
Severe weight loss usually follows, and in dairy cows, a severe drop in
milk production commonly occurs. Affected dairy cattle can appear to be
normal and will continue to eat about half of their feed intake.
How is this disease transmitted?
Certain types of biting flies are known to transmit this disease, as well
as direct contact with infected animals. However, other paths of
transmission may exist.
Why is this important?
While vesicular stomatitis can cause economic losses to livestock
producers, it is a particularly significant disease because its outward
signs are similar to (although generally less severe than) those of
foot-and-mouth disease, a foreign animal disease of cloven-hoofed animals
that was eradicated from the United States in 1929. The clinical signs of
vesicular stomatitis are also similar to those of swine vesicular disease,
another foreign animal disease. The only way to tell these diseases apart
is through laboratory tests.
Which animals are most susceptible?
Horses, swine and cattle are most at risk. However, other animals may also
contract the disease.
Has this disease been found in the U.S. before?
Last year [2004], Texas, New Mexico and Colorado had a problem with V.S.,
but Arizona managed to escape without any cases. In 2005 so far, Arizona is
the 2nd state to detect the disease, which occurs normally on 5- to 8-year
cycles.
How is this disease treated and is it fatal?
This disease has no known treatment and needs to run its course. The
animal's immune system must be supported throughout the recovery. Most
animals do not die of this disease. <http://www.agriculture.state.az.us.>
