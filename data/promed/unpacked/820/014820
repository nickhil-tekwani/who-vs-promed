Deformities in Chinese sturgeon linked to chemical
--------------------------------------------------
A paint chemical that is widely used in China is leaking into the Yangtze
River and may be responsible for deformities and decreasing numbers of rare
wild Chinese sturgeon, a study has found. In an article published in the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers said a
significant proportion of juvenile sturgeon caught at the river had either
one or no eyes, or had misshapen skeletons
[<http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/05/25/0809434106.abstract>].

Chinese sturgeon, which have existed on earth for 140 million years, are
among the 1st class of protected animals in China. The slow-growing fish
has an increased capacity to accumulate the paint chemical triphenyltin
(TPT), which contains tin.

The experts collected 2 and 3 day old Chinese sturgeon larvae from a
spawning area below the Gezhouba Dam 38 km (24 miles) downstream from the
Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River. They later hatched in a laboratory
in Jingzhou city in central Hubei province where 6.3 per cent were found
with skeletal deformities and 1.2 per cent had either no eyes or just one eye.

"Maternal transfer of TPT ... in eggs of wild Chinese sturgeon poses a
significant risk to the larvae naturally fertilised or hatched in the
Yangtze River," wrote the researchers, led by Hu Jiangying at the College
of Urban and Environmental Sciences at Beijing University.

TPT is extensively used in paints to prevent the fouling of ship hulls and
fishing nets. It is also used in fungicide to treat crops in China. A
derivative of TPT is also used to eliminate snails in paddy fields.

Earlier studies attributed the steep decline in Chinese sturgeon numbers to
loss of spawning habitat because of the construction of the Three Gorges
Dam and Gezhouba Dam.

More robust tests
-----------------
In this study, 2 adult males and 2 adult females of the Chinese sturgeon
were also captured from the Yangtze River for artificial propagation and
3.9 per cent of the juveniles were later observed to have malformed
skeletons, while 1.7 per cent had one or no eyes. Subjecting their study to
more robust testing, the researchers injected TPT into batches of eggs of
the Chinese sturgeon and Siberian sturgeon.

"Experimental exposure of Chinese and Siberian sturgeon (eggs) to elevated
TPT levels resulted in an increase in the occurrence of deformities, the
rates of which were consistent with those seen in wild populations exposed
to similar concentrations of the compound," they wrote.

"Together, these multiple lines of evidence were consistent with the
hypothesis that TPT was the likely cause of the malformations observed in
larvae of wild Chinese sturgeon, although other contaminants may be present
that could produce similar effects."

[Triphenyltin is an organotin compound and as such can cause reproductive
and developmental effects in a variety of species. When these effects occur
it is at a level that is almost toxic to the maternal organism. Organotin
compounds are also associated with endocrine organ damage as well as damage
to other sensory organisms such as the eye. While the mechanism of action
is not well understood, the effects are well recognized.

Toxicants are generally time and dose dependant. In this study it is not
clear how long the sturgeons have been exposed, but it seems likely that it
was for some lengthily period of time. Realizing that dilution is the
solution to pollution, then it further enforces the theory that the time is
long, despite the dose. It is also unclear how sensitive sturgeons are to
this particular compound. - Mod.TG
