The State Oceanic Administration (SOA) has detected large areas of red tide
along both the northern and southern Chinese coasts. Red tide measuring 680
square kilometres had been detected by 6 pm on Sunday in sea waters to the
south of Dalian, in Northeast China's Liaoning Province.
Dou Yueming, an official with the administration's North China Sea Bureau,
said it occurred not far from the Bohai Sea area where 6300 square
kilometres of red tide had just receded on Saturday.
Bureau officials were keeping a close watch on the red tide, and
surveillance teams were sent to the affected waters, according to the
official.
Marine scientists were yet to determine whether the disastrous red tide
algae would spread further. The bureau advised local fishermen not to
refresh water in their fish pools, to avoid the red tide. The scientists
also advised local fishermen to move fish and other aquatic products to safe
waters, as the poisonous algae of the red tide pose a grave threat to marine
life.
The red tide in waters along the Guangdong coast was first spotted in
Raoping on 10 Jul 1999 and has rapidly spread to cover 400 square kilometres
since last Wednesday, Qian Honglin, vice-director of the administration's
South China Sea Bureau stationed in Guangzhou, said yesterday.
The red tide showed little sign of further expansion, however, flowing sea
water was pushing it southwestward to Nan'ao Island off the coast.
Red tide occurred in the same area between November 1997 and January 1998,
causing some 60 million yuan (US$7.2 million) in economic losses.
