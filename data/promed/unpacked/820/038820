The Botucatu region, 226 km from Sao Paulo, is on alert for yellow
fever [YF]. Another person died in the city of yellow fever. Only
this month [March 2009], there have been 4 cases. The latest death
occurred Monday [23 Mar 2009] in Piraju. The victim was a man of 48
years.

Another 6 people in Piraju, from a nearby town, are interned in the
Unesp [University of Sao Paulo State] hospital of Botucatu with
suspected [YF] disease. In Sarutaia, there is a confirmed [YF] case;
last week, a 39-year-old man died in the city. The Municipal Health
Secretariat awaits confirmation of another possible victim, a woman of
20 years who died with similar symptoms.

Up to the present, Itatinga, another city in the region, has 3
confirmed cases and one death. According to the State Secretariat of
Health, these are victims of sylvan [jungle] yellow fever, where the
infection occurred in a rural environment. Because of the confirmation
of deaths from YF, as of this Tuesday [24 Mar 2009], the health posts
in Botucatu will begin a vaccination campaign.

According to the Secretary of Health of Botucatu, those who received
the vaccine within the last 10 years do not need to repeat the
vaccination, but all those who were not vaccinated, or who received
the vaccine more than 10 years ago, should seek [vaccination at] a
health unit.
