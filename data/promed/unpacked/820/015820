An outbreak of dengue fever in the south Kordofan region of central Sudan in
October has claimed the lives of an estimated 75 people and affected 300
others, the UN World Health Organization (WHO) and the country's health
ministry reported on Thursday�The 1st recorded dengue fever outbreak in Sudan
was reported in the mid-1980s in Red Sea state. Its case fatality rate was 25
percent.<
The unusually high quoted CFR for dengue in the current report (75/375 = 20
percent) calls for comment.
While the general stated case fatality rate for dengue is less than 5 per
cent, there have been outbreaks with reports of 15 per cent or more. However,
these are in localities where there have been repeated outbreaks with
different serotypes succeeding each other at intervals of 5 years or less.
Since the last published dengue outbreak in Sudan was 20 years ago (see
Reference below), one would expect the ratio of DHF to uncomplicated dengue
cases to approximate that found after the 2001-2 epidemic in Cuba, which was
81/12 889, with few of them fatal (Gonzalez D, Castro OE, Kouri G, Perez J, et
al. Classical dengue hemorrhagic fever resulting from two dengue infections
spaced 20 years or more apart: Havana, Dengue 3 epidemic, 2001-2002. Int J
Infect Dis. 2005 Sep; 9(5):280-5).
Flaviviruses are notorious for giving cross-reactions in serological tests, so
it is important to know whether dengue virus was actually isolated, or
identified by PCR. There was an outbreak of yellow fever in the Nuba
Mountains of Kordofan decades ago, and hopefully that has been excluded.

Hyams KC, Oldfield EC, Scott RM, et al. 1986. Evaluation of febrile patients
in Port Sudan, Sudan: isolation of dengue virus. Am J Trop Med Hyg. 1986 Jul;35
(4):860-5.
�One hundred consecutive patients admitted to the Port Sudan Hospital with a
temperature greater than or equal to 100 degrees F were evaluated... Virologic
studies identified 21 cases of dengue infection. One dengue 1 and 17 dengue 2
infections were diagnosed by viral isolation. Three untyped dengue infections
were identified serologically. The clinical presentation and course of
patients infected with dengue virus were most consistent with classic dengue
fever. There was no evidence of hemorrhagic phenomena or shock in any of the
dengue-infected patients��
