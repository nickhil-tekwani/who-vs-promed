Date of start of the event: 19 Jun 2017
Date of confirmation of the event: 27 Jul 2017
Date event resolved: 7 Aug 2017
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 5.3 percent
Mortality: 5.3 percent
Zoonotic impact: No
Causal agent: Orthomyxo-like virus

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak 1 (TiLV_Perlis): Timah Tasoh dam, Timah Tasoh, Kangar, Perlis
Date of start of the outbreak: 19 Jun 2017
Outbreak status: resolved on 7 Aug 2017
Epidemiological unit: lake
Water type: fresh water
Population type: wild
Production system: open
Affected animals
Species / Morbidity / Mortality/ Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Black Tilapia (_Oreochromis spp._) / 0.71 percent / 0.71 percent/ 42 000 / 300 / 300 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The affected population is wild tilapia. Total number of wild tilapia in the dam is unknown. A total of 300 tilapias died prior to investigation. Dead fish were disposed accordingly. No other mortalities or moribund fish were observed after the end date.

Outbreak 2 (TiLV_Kedah): Pial River, Merbok, Kuala Muda, Kedah
Date of start of the outbreak: 4 Jul 2017
Outbreak status: resolved on 27 Jul 2017
Epidemiological unit: pond
Water type: fresh water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-open
Affected animals
Species / Morbidity / Mortality/ Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Hybrid Red Tilapia (_Oreochromis spp._) / 15 percent / 15 percent/ 20 000 / 3 000 / 3000/ 0 / 17 000
Affected population: The affected population is farmed tilapia. Dead fish were then disposed accordingly. Other susceptible fish in the same unit were then harvested for consumption.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The competent authority (CA) was notified of the disease due to unexplained mortalities of tilapia in the reported zones. The CA then investigated the mortality, restricted movement of fish in the area and collected samples. All the samples were tested using conventional PCR. The CA has supervised the proper disposal of fish carcasses and farm disinfection. The remaining fish were harvested and the farmer was advised to do the break cycle for one month. The monitoring activity was continued and no more tilapia mortality was reported.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists), no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Fish Health Research Division (NaFisH) (National laboratory) / Black Tilapia (_Oreochromis sp._) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 27 Jul 2017 / Positive
National Fish Health Research Division (NaFisH) (National laboratory) / Hybrid Red Tilapia (_Oreochromis sp._) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 27 Jul 2017 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[The following comment is quoted from the factsheet of Tilapia lake virus, published by CGIAR Research Program on Fish Agri-food Systems, 2017, http://pubs.iclarm.net/resource_centre/FISH-2017-03.pdf:

"Tilapia lake virus is a newly emerging virus that is associated with significant mortalities in farmed tilapia. With cases reported across Africa, Asia and South America, the virus represents a huge risk to the global tilapia industry, whose 2015 production was valued at USD 9.8 billion. All countries with a tilapia industry must be vigilant and act quickly to investigate cases of mortalities in farms.

"There has been no report of any human health-related issues linked to the consumption of affected tilapia from any of the affected countries since the emergence of TiLV. Looking at fish viruses overall, including TiLV, there is no evidence for a fish virus causing disease in humans."

OIE's disease card on the emerging 'Tilapia lake virus" (TiLV) is also available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/Aquatic_Commission/A_TiLV_disease_card.pdf. - Mod.CRD
