Texas sees rise in canine flu cases
-----------------------------------
Veterinarians are seeing a spike in cases of the canine influenza.
Since September [2011], there have been 30 confirmed cases of canine
influenza "A" in San Antonio, Texas, and another 70 cases are
suspected. This flu is also known as H3N8.

Veterinarians say they don't want dog owners to panic, but they want
them to be aware that it can strike quickly.

According the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) the
canine influenza virus can be spread by direct contact with infected
dogs and by contact with contaminated objects. The canines with an
increased risk are those who frequent dog daycares, parks and boarding
facilities.

Susan Wagi, who's been a vet for more almost 20 years, says the
influenza is an upper respiratory infection and parks, doggy daycares
and boarding facilities can expose your pet to dogs that have the
infection. She says, "Just like daycare centers for children where
kids get upper respiratory infections frequently."

The signs of illness in dogs are cough, runny nose and fever, though
some dogs may not show any signs at all. Severe illness can cause
pneumonia which may lead to death. There is no cure for the H3N8
virus, but a vaccine has been approved to treat the virus.

[An owner] and her dog Timmy frequent outdoor parks. She says, "I like
for my dog to socialize get along with other dogs because he's stuck
in the apartment all day." She says she makes sure her dog is in good
health and takes him to the vet as soon as she sees any signs that he
may be sick. She says, "He has pet insurance so he's always getting
vaccines and if anything's wrong, he's taken care of."

And that what vets recommend, regular checkups. The best way to
prevent the virus is through vaccination.

The virus cannot infect humans and cannot jump to cats or other
species. There are tests your vet can do to make sure that if your dog
is infected, they can be treated properly.

According to the CDC, 38 states, including Texas, have reported cases
of the dog flu. The 1st case was recorded back in 2004 in Florida.

[Like many communicable diseases, canine influenza is passed around
easily in a social setting.

It is a serious disease and owners should pay particular attention to
their animal's health as this disease can be fairly rapid in its
progression and medical intervention is needed sooner rather than
later. Please take the precaution to vaccinate your pet. Vaccines can
be life saving!
