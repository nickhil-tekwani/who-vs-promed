The spread of a common waterfowl illness is believed to be the cause of a "significant" number of dead ducks seen recently in the Merrimack River. City of Lowell officials said they contacted the Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife and were informed that the deaths are likely being caused by avian botulism.

"The National Park Service sent us a note saying that they had seen 8 ducks floating in the water," Marion Larson with Massachusetts Wildlife said. "The disease is called avian botulism, and the cause is an abundance of the toxin being present in the soil." Some sick birds are drowning, unable to hold their heads up while others can't breathe due to paralysis of their respiratory muscles. "Ducks, geese, swans, although swans seem to have a little bit less risk, and that probably has to do with their feeding habits," Larson said.

There were 200 bird deaths around Massachusetts and New England last year [2020], including an outbreak that hit the lagoon at the Boston Public Garden in the fall. The water there was drained, but along the Merrimack River, it is not an option.

"We have been recommending that if there's any feeding activity, that it stop because you're congregating the birds together," Larson said. "We all know that certain diseases can pass very easily when you have crowds."

Botulism in birds does not cause illness in humans, but people should not touch dead or ailing animals. "This is probably affecting local populations in the area, but overall, waterfowl populations are thriving," Larson said. Lowell city officials urged the public not to feed ducks by the River Walk in order to prevent ducks from congregating which could lead to further spread of the disease.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_. This pathogen is widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. Several types of toxin are produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (for example, chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots) feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.

Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the 3rd eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.

Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) is highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment.

Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade, and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin.
