News Release
-------------------------------------------
Avian Influenza Case Confirmed on Maryland's Eastern Shore; Quarantine
Order Extended; Biosecurity Practices Remain Heightened

This afternoon, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary
Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa confirmed the presence of the H7 strain
of avian influenza in a commercial poultry flock on Maryland's Lower
Eastern Shore. The University of Delaware's Lasher Laboratory sent the
samples to the Ames, Iowa laboratory last night.

This is the same strain that was found during February 2004 in 2 flocks in
Delaware, but there is no known connection between the Maryland and
Delaware cases. A press conference will be held at 10 a.m. Sun 7 Mar 2004
at the Holiday Inn Express, 125 Newtown Blvd, Pocomoke City off U.S. 13.

This case was detected through the surveillance efforts established after
the 2 positive cases were found in Delaware during February 2004. As of
Friday, 5 Mar a total of 1950 houses representing 828 farms on Delmarva
have all tested negative for avian influenza. This represents approximately
43 percent of the total number of commercial farms and approximately 38
percent of the total number of commercial houses on the Peninsula. This
morning there was a meeting of the Delmarva Emergency Poultry Disease Task
Force, which includes Delmarva poultry companies, epidemiology,
agriculture, and health officials from Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and
the U.S. governments, to coordinate the approach to address this new avian
influenza case.

"We are taking all measures possible to protect Maryland's farm community
and our poultry industry," said Maryland Agriculture Secretary Lewis R. Riley.

"We placed the farm under quarantine last evening. I have issued a new
Quarantine Order to address the new geographic area and situation. It is
imperative that each and every poultry farmer, company representative, feed
hauler, and all others associated with the birds on the Eastern Shore
continue to practice the highest levels of biosecurity on their farms, in
their businesses and at home. I thank everyone for their cooperation in
this very difficult time."

The positive farm is in the Pocomoke City area and is made up of 4 poultry
houses with approximately 118 000 6-week-old broilers. The chickens will be
destroyed humanely, or depopulated tomorrow morning and composted on-farm
and in-house.

The owner of this farm has an 8-house farm with 2-week-old birds about 1
mile from the first farm. Because of the close relationship between these
farms, and the shared personnel and equipment, as a proactive step to
prevent spread of the disease, those 210 000 birds will also be depopulated.

His third farm is about 2 miles from the original farm and the one-week-old
birds on that farm will be observed for the time being.

The new quarantine applies to the areas of Maryland south of Rt. 50 to the
Virginia border. The quarantine restricts movement of poultry and poultry
litter and imposes additional biosecurity precautions.

There are 71 farms with 171 poultry houses within a 6-mile radius of the
positive farm, all of which will be sampled for presence of avian
influenza. Pre-processing testing will continue across all of Delmarva
until at least 16 Mar 2004.

Poultry in Maryland accounted for USD 440 million or 31 percent of the
state's $1.4 billion agriculture industry in 2002, the last year for which
there are statistics. In addition, 60 percent or more of the state's
cropland is dedicated to grains for poultry feed. There are approximately
1100 poultry farms on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Maryland's last outbreak of
avian influenza was in 1993 among game birds on a Queen Anne's county farm.

The H7 strain of avian influenza could be a serious threat to the Delmarva
poultry industry if it spreads, but has not been associated with serious
human illness.

Avian influenza spreads easily among birds through nasal and eye secretions
as well as manure. It can spread rapidly from flock to flock and can be
carried across great distances by contaminated vehicles, equipment, and
clothing, for example.

Note: Reporters are reminded that they are to stay off of poultry farms.

[The same story was reported in the Sunday Washington Post
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A37109-2004Mar6.html>
and in the sunday NewsDay
<http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/wire/sns-ap-bird-flu-maryland,0,6019546,print.story?coll=3Dsns-ap-nationworld-headlines>

The Delmarva (Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia) peninsula is a contiguous
land area. It is likely that there is transit along the routes and perhaps
some ill chicks are leaving trails or moving along the peninsula.

Currently, Delaware and New Jersey have H7N2, but Pennsylvania has H2N2 and
Texas has H5N2 (Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza).

Although this news release only specifies H7, it is likely it is H7N2, as
Maryland is part of the Delmarva region. - Mods.MPP/TG]
