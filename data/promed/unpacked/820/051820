The number of cases [of _E. coli_ infection linked to that outbreak in
Albany has slowed down. Figures released late yesterday show 771 suspected
cases. One-hundred-and-eight of them have been confirmed in state
laboratories. One state health expert says the relative lack of secondary
infections shows the outbreak may finally have peaked. The original cases
came from contaminated well water at the Washington County
Fair.
Nine people are [also reporting _E. coli_-like symptoms in Rensselaer
County. Like the outbreak in Washington County, these people were attending
a Fair. They were at the Schaghticoke Fair. While officials aren't sure
where the contamination came
from, the State Health Commissioner did confirm that a vendor from
Connecticut worked at both the fairs and brought water from Washington
County that was used for drinks at the second location.
