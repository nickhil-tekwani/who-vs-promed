Infection with SARS-CoV-2, Italy
--------------------------------
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 18 Mar 2021
Date of confirmation of the event: 6 Apr 2021
Report date: 22 Apr 2021
Reason for notification: emerging disease
Morbidity: 0.59%
Mortality: -
Zoonotic potential: no
Causal agent: SARS-CoV-2
This event pertains a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Villa del Conte, Padua, Veneto
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Mar 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Mustelidae / 3379 / 20 / 0 / - / - / 0

Affected population: The minks were controlled in the framework of a national surveillance plan. A certain percentage of animals resulted seropositive with seroneutralization test. Some workers in the holding were seropositive as well. No symptoms or abnormal mortality was observed in the mink population.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: workers infected with SARS-CoV-2

Control measures applied in domestic: disinfection, disinfestation, movement control inside the country, screening, traceability, quarantine

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Experimental Zooprophylactic Institute (IZS), Venezie (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Mustelidae / virus neutralization test (Ab VNT) / 6 Apr 2021 / positive

[The following abstract comes from a European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) scientific report titled "Monitoring of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection in mustelids," which is available in reference below:

Abstract:

"American mink and ferret are highly susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), but no information is available for other mustelid species. SARS‐CoV‐2 spreads very efficiently within mink farms once introduced, by direct and indirect contact; high within‐farm animal density increases the chance for transmission. Between‐farm spread is likely to occur once SARS‐CoV‐2 is introduced; short distance between SARS‐CoV‐2-positive farms is a risk factor. As of 29 Jan 2021, SARS‐CoV‐2 virus has been reported in 400 mink farms in 8 countries in the European Union. In most cases, the likely introduction of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection into farms was infected humans. Human health can be at risk by mink‐related variant viruses, which can establish circulation in the community, but so far these have not shown to be more transmissible or cause more severe impact compared with other circulating SARS‐CoV‐2. Concerning animal health risk posed by SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, the animal species that may be included in monitoring plans are American mink, ferrets, cats, raccoon dogs, white‐tailed deer, and Rhinolophidae bats. All mink farms should be considered at risk of infection; therefore, the monitoring objective should be early detection. This includes passive monitoring (in place in the whole territory of all countries where animals susceptible to SARS‐CoV‐2 are bred) but also active monitoring by regular testing. First, frequent testing of farm personnel and all people in contact with the animals is recommended. Furthermore, randomly selected animals (dead or sick animals should be included) should be tested using reverse transcriptase‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), ideally at weekly intervals (i.e., design prevalence approximately 5% in each epidemiological unit, to be assessed case by case). Suspected animals (dead or with clinical signs and a minimum 5 animals) should be tested for confirmation of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Positive samples from each farm should be sequenced to monitor virus evolution and results publicly shared."
