Scientists say there is no danger from the deadly bat-borne lyssavirus to
Australia's rabies-free status. The infection, with rabies-like symptoms,
has been responsible for the deaths of two Queensland women since it was
identified in 1996.
Harvey Westbury from the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong
says the lyssavirus family comes under a different classification to
rabies. "Those international authorities have determined on the basis of
the data that we've given them that lyssavirus is not rabies," he said.
"We don't have rabies virus in the country, that's accepted by all the
international authorities that determine these things."

[Let's take these statements one at a time:
1. "bat-borne lyssavirus" -- According to the International Committee on
Taxonomy of Viruses, an arm of the Virology Division, International Union
of Microbiology Societies, within the virus family Rhabdoviridae are five
genera, one of which is "_Lyssavirus_" (italicized and capitalized). Any
virus within this genus can be called "a lyssavirus". Not "lyssavirus" or
"the lyssavirus". It is a generic term, just as the term "paramyxovirus"
can be used to signify a member of the family Paramyxoviridae or a member
of the genus _Paramyxovirus_.
The term "bat-borne lyssavirus" should only be taken to mean a member of
the genus _Lyssavirus_ detected in a bat. It does not mean a specific
virus within that genus.
2. "rabies-like symptoms" -- This means disease symptoms similar to or
identical with symptoms cased by rabies virus.
3. "the lyssavirus family comes under a different classification to [sic
rabies."-- First, lyssaviruses do not constitute a family. As outlined
above, the term "lyssavirus" indicates a member of the genus _Lyssavirus_".
The family is Rhabdoviridae. Second, rabies virus is a member of the genus
_Lyssavirus_, and therefore is "a lyssavirus". It is inordinately
illogical to suggest that two viruses belonging to the same genus belong to
different families.
4. "Those international authorities have determined on the basis of the
data that we've given them that lyssavirus is not rabies," -- Rabies virus
causes the disease "rabies". The newly discovered Australian lyssavirus
(called variously "Ballina virus", "Australian bat lyssavirus", "bat
lyssavirus", and by other epithets, caused a rabies-like disease in at
least two patients. Disease classification is not tantamount to virus
classification, which nowadays is done on a basis ogf genetics.
5. "We don't have rabies virus in the country, that's accepted by all the
international authorities that determine these things." -- What Australia
does not have is classical, prototype rabies virus. It has a rabies-like
virus and one apparently can protect against infection with this virus by
immunizing against classical rabies virus.
If Ballina (or whatever people want to call it) virus is sufficiently
different from prototype rabies virus, it will have to be on more
conclusive and definitive grounds than are being used in this press report.
I hope no one interprets my comments as suggesting that I have adequate
data to determine, or that I am saying, whether Ballina virus is or is not
identical or sufficiently closely related to prototype rabies virus such as
to consider them the same virus. All I am saying is that the waters
continue to be muddied by poor taxonomy. There is a great deal riding on
these hair-splitting arguments.
If Jean Smith or another internationally recognized authority on
definitions of lyssavirus species would care to correct my statements or
to otherwise comment, we would be pleased to pass those comments to our
readers. If you are an international nonauthority, please reserve your
opinions. - Mod.CHC
