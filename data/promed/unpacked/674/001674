Japanese encephalitis vaccine was given [twice] 3 years ago to a 5-year-old child, separated by a 4-month [booster]. The 1st shot, given in August 2010, was part of the child's immunization schedule, the 2nd in December of that year, in a massive campaign across Uttar Pradesh and parts of Bihar to ensure the vaccine reached all "left out" children. The boy was admitted [in 2013] to the Nehru Hospital in BRD Medical College, where he died the next day.

The boy was one of the 5 confirmed JE cases in Gorakhpur this year [2013]. The adjoining districts saw another 20 cases. Besides one deceased girl whose family had persistently refused vaccination, all the dead children had been given the protective shots.

Since 1 Jan [2013], over 1000 children have been admitted to the hospital, and 258 have died with the same classic symptoms -- high fever, convulsions, altered senses, rigidity in the limbs and nausea -- now associated with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Only 61 of these children were found to be JE positive.

A total of 226 admissions and 59 deaths have been from Gorakhpur, and 248 cases and 43 deaths from Kushinagar. These have been the 2 worst affected districts this year [2013]. In all of this, Gorakhpur has seen 5 JE cases and Kushinagar 8.

Until the mid-2000s, it was JE that was considered the annual mysterious killer of children and early teens in the Purvanchal belt of eastern UP and Bihar. Now, a decade later, it has been crossed off as a "minority disease" by scientists. The doubts over JE, which started arising [in] 2006 and saw some vindication in 2009, have been confirmed "to a great extent" now.

Of 1000 samples of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from children admitted between April and December last year [2012] to Gorakhpur's BRD Medical College, 100 isolates for organisms called enteroviruses (EV) -- specifically the human EV 89 and EV 76 types -- have been identified by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) field station in Gorakhpur. A 10 per cent positivity is considered a huge success for CSF samples. These viruses spread through contaminated water and can cause symptoms similar to JE and are covered under the umbrella of diseases that constitute AES. The JE virus, which causes similar symptoms and is also included under the category of AES diseases, has a completely different route of transmission: it is hosted in pigs, water birds and other livestock and is carried to humans by mosquitoes.

These findings have been heartening for scientists who were initially reluctant to accept the EV theory due to contradictory results between rectal swabs and CSF samples -- considered the more direct evidence of brain tissue -- until 2011. From 2008-11, while rectal swab samples showed a 15-44 per cent positivity for EVs, CSF samples from the same patients showed positivity rates of between 1.8 per cent and 2.3 per cent.

Dr Milind Gore, director of NIV Gorakhpur, who has headed the station's activities since 2006, said: "There were initial doubts that the virus strands which we were identifying in the rectal swabs were not traversing to the brain tissue, since we could not collate them in the CSF samples. To counter this theory, in 2012, we only tested for CSF samples and put them through rigorous testing, and we have managed to identify 100 isolates of enteroviruses. For us, it's a huge boost, since it's coming from hard primary evidence."

The 1st doubts about JE started after deaths continued despite exhaustive mass immunization campaigns, and lab results provided no concrete answers. In 2006, despite JE vaccinations, 700-800 seizures were reported, and over 150 children died. Most of these children had received JE vaccination. The mystery remains to be fully explained.

This year [2013], 6 per cent of cases are JE positive, and about 10-15 per cent EV, which leaves the vast majority of cases still undiagnosed. "We are trying to identify the causative agents in all samples, but there are other factors that need to be considered. The causative agent is the most active in the CSF samples only within the 1st 2-3 days of onset. A majority of children are coming to us late, and hence we are losing out on identifying the pathogens there," said Dr K P Kushwaha, principal and head of the department of paediatrics at BRD Medical College.

Unlike bacteria, viruses need active cell lines to multiply for scientists to examine them. "Earlier, we were using only one such cell line; now we are hoping that more viruses will multiply in our laboratories. We have identified isolated cases of measles and herpes viruses but not in considerable numbers. We are trying to lay our hands on something more, but so far, we have not been successful," Dr Gore said. He adds that even in the best diagnosed international outbreak situations, only about 50 per cent of cases are actually diagnosed. "Considering that, we can say EVs have solved at least some of the mystery, though not all of it."

As scientists and doctors struggle to get a handle on the 3-decade-old disease, many complain that the clinical and administrative management of the outbreaks remain flawed.

In Gorakhpur, the hub of the management of the disease, representatives of the only medical college in the area and district authorities cannot agree on several things.

The hundreds of AES cases that are finding their way into government records are coming only from the one medical college and district hospitals in the area. The disease is still to be officially declared a notifiable disease like other common viral diseases like dengue, where every case has to be reported.

Said Dr Kushwaha: "All the patients who are coming to us are referrals from private hospitals, and by the time they are coming here, they are already so critical that in the majority of the cases, it is too late for us to do anything. Why can't private hospitals report these cases early?" He said this year [2013], only 10 per cent of patients are direct entrants, the rest being referrals from private centres. "The government is losing out on precious data due to this mismanagement."

But district health authorities say there is no monitoring of medical college treatment records, and inflated figures are presented, the definition of AES itself being flawed.

CMO [Chief Medical Officer] of Gorakhpur Dr M P Singh said, "The unwritten protocol the medical college seems to be following is that any patient who comes with the symptoms of fever, nausea and altered sensorium is declared AES, without waiting for laboratory results. Later, if any of these patients tests positive for malaria, typhoid or meningitis, the case records are not changed. They just put it down as AES with any of these other diseases. This is an absurd situation, where eventually you are diagnosing the disease, but still declaring it as AES."

Dr Singh said that last year [2012], of the 8 cases that the medical college declared JE positive, repeat tests on 6 showed only 3 to be actually positive. Cases are being reported round the year; 18 cases came in April [2013], many of them children under the age of one year. "How can a child below the age of one have AES which they say is from EVs? A child that young only has mother's milk, so what is the source of contaminated water," he asked. He said district health authorities had, after "umpteen reminders," managed to access treatment records of deceased patients this year [2013] and were studying them.

[The cases of AES continue to be puzzling. The above report indicates that only a small proportion are due to JEV infections. The occurrence of JEV infections in previously vaccinated children may be due to a decline in protective immunity in individuals who received killed virus vaccine in the more distant past or lack of vaccine potency.

The report does not indicate whether the vaccine was killed or the live attenuated one that would provide longer protection. The massive JEV vaccination campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Behar states has resulted in a significant reduction in cases due to infection with that virus. As implied in many reports in recent years, apparently, many of the AES cases are due to enterovirus infection. Detection of theses viruses in CSF is more convincing evidence of etiological cause than isolation only from rectal swabs, which may indicate intestinal infections without invasion of the CNS.

The cause of the majority of the AES cases remains undiagnosed, and one hopes that the scientists involved in attempting to determine the etiologies of these undiagnosed cases will continue to find out what is going on so that scientifically sound preventive measures may be devised and implemented. Although JEV outbreaks may continue to be prevented through vaccination, preventing enterovirus infections, in the absence of vaccines, requires improvement of sanitation infrastructure to assure adequate human waste disposal and uncontaminated potable water supplies, a very costly effort.
