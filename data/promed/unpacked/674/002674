Babesia on Block Island, Rhode Island State
-------------------------------------------
If you came down with a fever, sweats, and fatigue this summer, you might have thought you had a summer flu, but it is possible you experienced a tick-borne illness -- one that's perhaps not as familiar as Lyme Disease, but an increasing health threat. It's called babesiosis, it's a parasite or malarial type of illness, and it's on the increase on Block Island and throughout the region.

One of the panelists, infectious disease specialist Dr. Fred Silverblatt, spoke about tick-borne diseases from his own personal experience as well as that of his patients. He has had Lyme Disease and babesiosis 3 times each, separately and at the same time. "I was suddenly delirious," he said, describing the severe onset of his illness. He forgot how to tell time, and his own son's name, he related. After hospitalization he needed rehabilitation, and complete recovery took 6 months.

With this introduction, he convinced the audience that these are serious diseases. Joining Dr. Silverblatt on the panel were Dr. Maria Diuk-Wasser, an epidimiologist at Yale University, Liz Dyer, nurse practitioner at the Block Island Health Center, and Mary Sue Record, chair of Block Island's Deer Task Force.

New findings on both Lyme Disease and babesiosis were touched on during the hour presentation. Diuk-Wasser, who studies the environmental and behavioral aspects of tick-borne disease on Block Island, found that the more "edge" or brushy vegetative growth around a yard, the more ticks are harbored. The creatures are not found in the cut grass portions of a homeowner's lot. Diuk-Wasser's research teams have been canvassing the edges of yards on Block Island, counting deer ticks and analyzing them to find out if they are infected with illnesses.

The proportion of infected ticks she found on the island is 30 percent, compared to 20 or 25 percent in a site studied on the mainland. The reservoir of these illnesses are white tailed mice, and Dr. Diuk-Wasser surmised that there are more mice here than on the mainland, where they have many natural enemies. However, as Record later pointed out, the ticks feed on the mice, pick up the organisms that cause disease from them, and then in the next stage of life jump onto the island deer. Without the deer, they would not be able grow into adults and leave us the next generation of ticks. On Monhegan Island, where deer were eliminated, these diseases disappeared 2 years later, Record said. Diuk-Wasser also divulged that Dr. Peter Krauss, who has been studying Lyme Disease on Block Island for about 20 years, has found a ratio of 3 cases of Lyme Disease to every case of babesiosis here. On the mainland, that ratio is one case of babesiosis to 30 cases of Lyme.

Lyme disease
------------
Researchers have "recently found persistent evidence of DNA material from Lyme bacteria" in some people. Treatment was Dyer's focus. She said people come to the island's Medical Center complaining, "I feel Limey," and often, they do have the illness. She said the center is being more aggressive in its treatment than in the past. Silverblatt recommends "early intervention." If you are bitten by a tick, take 200 mg of doxycycline, he said, which has been shown to often nip babesiosis in the bud. In the past, he acknowledged it was thought that a mild case of babesiosis was self limiting and did not need treatment, but now, all cases get treatment with an antibiotic and a 2nd drug, quinine.

The parasite that causes it is so similar to the malaria parasite that it is hard to differentiate them inside a blood cell. Advice from the panelists which many of us have heard before and often ignore: wear protective clothing outside, especially permethrin treated clothing; shower after working in the garden or brush; check yourself for ticks. There is even an app for iPhones which shows a picture of the deer tick.

[Babesia is endemic on the other islands north of Block Island, Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard, and is increasingly recognized as a human health problem on the east coast of the United States.

A recent survey of Babesia in the US (Anderson SA et al. Babesiosis among Elderly Medicare Beneficiaries, United States, 2006-2008. EID 2012,18 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/1/11-0305_article.htm) found the highest rates were seen in Connecticut, Rhode Island, New York, and Massachusetts.

A study of antibodies against Babesia in blood donors from the northeastern United States found a 1.1 percent seroprevalence was identified in Connecticut and a seroprevalence for the offshore islands of Massachusetts of 1.4 percent (Johnson ST et al. Seroprevalence of Babesia microti in blood donors from Babesia-endemic areas of the northeastern United States: 2000 through 2007. Transfusion. 2009;49:2574-82.). Thus Babesia is a common infection and the majority of the cases are asymptomatic. - Mod.EP]

[According to wikipedia, "Block Island is part of the U.S. state of Rhode Island and is located in the Atlantic Ocean approximately 13 miles (21 km) south of the coast of Rhode Island, 14 miles (23 km) east of Montauk Point on Long Island, and is separated from the Rhode Island mainland by Block Island Sound." (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_Island for a more in-depth discussion of Block Island and a map showing the location of the island in relation to the USA mainland). - Mod.MPP
