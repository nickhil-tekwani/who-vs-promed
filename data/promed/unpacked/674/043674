Arvandkenar district governor said that the cause of death of a number of large livestock in one of the villages of Nasar district of Arvandkenar district is being investigated. In an interview with IRNA on Thursday [14 Oct 2021], Sadegh Jalali stated: "After learning about the death of heavy cattle in one of the villages, the issue was investigated in the field with the coordination of the district and department of veterinary medicine." He added, "In the initial investigation, it was found that the cause of death of these animals was due to a disease and has nothing to do with the water of the area."

Jalali said: "So far, exact statistics on the number of lost animals are not available and the issue is under further investigation."

In an interview with IRNA, the head of Abadan Veterinary department stated that the cause of death of large cattle in Nasar village was Charbon (Anthrax) disease and added that the necessary action to vaccinate cattle in the region is on the agenda. Assadollah Abbasi added: "Currently, veterinary groups are specially vaccinating the animals of the residents up to a certain radius in the region by preparing a vaccine." He added: "200 doses of vaccine will be prepared for injection and will be injected into the cattle of the region by Friday [15 Oct 2021]."

Charbon (Anthrax) disease is found in sheep, goats, and cattle, and the bacterial agent that causes the disease often causes disease in cattle through contaminated food and water.

[Khuzestan or Xuzestan province (Persian: استان خوزستان Ostān-e Khūzestān) is one of the 31 provinces of Iran. It is in the southwest of the country, bordering Iraq and the Persian Gulf. Its capital is Ahvaz. Khuzestan is known for its ethnic diversity; the population of Khuzestan consists of Lurs, Iranian Arabs, Qashqai people, Afshars, indigenous Persians (Dezfuli-Shushtari, Behbahani) and Iranian Armenians. Khuzestan's population is predominantly Shia Muslim, but there are small Christian, Jewish, Sunni and Mandean minorities. Half of Khuzestan's population is Lur. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khuzestan_Province.)

Arvandkenar (Persian: بخش اروندکنار) is a district (bakhsh) in Abadan County, Khuzestan Province, Iran. (See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arvandkenar_District.)

This is the second Iranian livestock outbreak this year after a gap of some 10 years. The previous one was in Ilam Province and both border with Iraq, where anthrax is more common. "Heavy" cattle will be working animals and because of their size will be a prime target for female tabanid flies attracted to the large black body of the animals, which can maximize the distance flown between blood meals. We must await the results of any veterinary investigations in the field as to their appreciation as to the cause of this anthrax outbreak.
