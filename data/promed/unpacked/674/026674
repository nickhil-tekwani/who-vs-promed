A health investigation continues in Rhode Island. Several egg crates
taken from a bakery have tested positive for salmonella.

The Rhode Island Department of Public Health tested the crates after
56 people became ill from salmonella. One man is believed to have died
as a result.

All of the people ate zeppoles made by Defusco's Bakery in Johnston.
The bakery stored the pastries in the egg crates.

[The number of suspected cases in this outbreak has increased to 56
and it is reported that a "smoking" egg crate has been found. The
serotype of _Salmonella enterica_ is not mentioned in the posting.
This appears to be another example of how poor kitchen hygiene can
spread disease: here the baked pastries were stored in egg crates
where raw eggs had been stored. This is no different from placing a
cooked chicken into the drippings of the chicken prior to it being
cooked. - Mod.LL]
