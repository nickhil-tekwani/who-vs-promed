Health officials in Gelephu [Bhutan] have intensified efforts to
educate the residents on malaria and its prevention after a malaria
outbreak was reported in the town of Dawsiree in Assam, India.
Dawsiree is just 15 km from Gelephu, with a long porous border.

Recently, a 21-year-old Indian died from malaria in the Gelephu
hospital. Dr Lobzang Dorji, the superintendent of the Gelephu
hospital, said: "People think there is no risk of malaria in the
winter, so they remain complacent. This is very risky."

Officials at the vector-born disease control programme in Gelephu are
also asking people traveling through Assam to take precautions and
visit a hospital if they show malaria-like symptoms. Officials have
already sensitized the residents of Gelephu on the malaria outbreak in
the border town in Assam and urged them to use impregnated mosquito
nets at night and avoid unnecessary visits to malaria prone areas.

[2] Madhya Pradesh, Sidhi

The malaria situation in Madhya Pradesh has reached a critical level,
with the death toll consistently increasing every day and the
opposition parties slamming the ruling BJP government for its failure
to contain the epidemic-like situation.

While the exact statewide death toll is not clear, tribal areas are
largely bearing the brunt of the disease.

According to reports, 35 deaths have been reported from the
tribal-dominated, malnutrition-affected Sidhi district alone, which
has emerged as the hub of the malaria epidemic during the last 2
weeks. However, the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) claims to
have conducted ground-level investigations to counter the official
death toll of 35.

The CPI(M) has alleged that over 85 deaths have occurred in and around
Sidhi district, citing information that the party's fact-finding team
has gathered from the affected areas, including Nimuch, Mandsaur etc.
"The situation is alarming, and the state government has proved
ineffective in containing it. The health minister should be sacked,"
said CPI(M) state general secretary Badal Saroj.

Leader of Opposition in the state assembly and Congress MLA Ajay Singh
a.k.a. Rahul Bhaiya had staged a dharna [fast conducted at the door of
an offender] before the Sidhi district collectorate a few days back to
protest against government inaction. Chauphal Pawaya and surrounding
villages like Kuthar have seen over 17 deaths including those of
several children.

The villages, just 16 km from the district headquarters, have exposed
the state government's weakness in ensuring health coverage in rural
areas. "All these deaths occurred between 20-30 Oct 2011. We set up a
health camp during the 1st week of November [2011]. Since then, there
have been no deaths," J.N.Kansotia, Commissioner, health department
told The Hindu. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chauhan recently visited
the affected villages and offered cash assistance of Rs. 10 000 [USD
190] each to the families of the deceased.

Last week at an event in Bhopal, state health minister Narottam Mishra
told reporters he was not fully aware of the situation, resulting in
opposition parties demanding his resignation. The government recently
removed the district collector, civil surgeon, and the Chief Medical
Health Officer of Sidhi.

[3] Madhya Pradesh, Mandsaur
Date: Tue 15 Nov 2011

A high-powered team of the central ministry visited the
malaria-affected villages of Mandsaur district on Monday [14 Nov
2011]. The team found the deaths were due to fever, and blood samples
had not been collected in most of the cases.

According to records available, 329 persons were affected by malaria.
As per reports, 21 persons have already died due to the disease in the
area. Also, it has come to the notice that there were 6 tribal
villages that were affected by malaria.

On the request of local MP Meenakshi Natrajan, union health minister
Ghulam Nabi Azad had sent a special team to visit the area to find out
the actual position in Mandsaur and Neemuch districts.

The epidemic was spreading very fast in several villages, falling
under both the districts. The local residents and representatives
blamed more than 40 deaths to malaria. On Monday [14 Nov 2011], a
central team comprising Dr Manish Joshi, Dr V Das, and Dr R K Vyas
visited 3 villages named as Sawant Kotary, Bordia and Mauli of Mansaur
district.

Chief medical and health officer of Mandsaur, Dr Mahesh Patni, and
Garoth SDM, Abhay Singh Ahoria accompanied the team. The team visited
several houses in these villages and talked to the people. The team
consulted local doctors including private practitioners on the topic.
They reportedly admitted that a large number of malaria-related cases
were still being detected.

Local Congress MLA and state ex-health minister Subhash Sojatia told
the team that the health department acted quite late, and the disease
had already taken the form of an epidemic by that time. He asserted
that all the 21 deaths were due to malaria and still a large number of
patients were coming to the hospitals.

Sojatia said that due to a lack of health facilities, malaria patients
are moving to Rajasthan for treatment. He said children were dying due
to malnutrition in tribal villages of the area.

Minister of state for health Mahendra Hardia denied the Congress MLA's
allegation, saying there are only 2 deaths due to malaria. "I have
myself visited each and every village, and the situation is now under
control," Hardia said.

Dr Manish Joshi, member of central team, and chief medical and health
officer Dr Mahesh Patni, who visited Mandsaur district, could not be
contacted via phone despite repeated efforts.

[Assam is regarded as a highly endemic part of India, with 50-100
malaria cases per 1000 population per year (see country profile, World
Malaria Report 2009:
