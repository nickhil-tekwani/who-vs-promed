[The following new information, not included in the immediate notification of 15 Dec 2021 (see 20211216.8700299), is included in the follow-up report No 1, submitted by the Palestinian Authority (PA) to the OIE on 23 Dec 2021 and circulated on 28 Dec 2021].

1. A second FMD outbreak in the village Al-Hadidiya, sub-district Tubas, district West Bank, affecting a mixed flock of 590 sheep and goats, from which 20 cases and 12 deaths occurred. No slaughter nor culling applied.

2. The first outbreak in the village had started on 12 Dec 2012, affecting a mixed herd of 172 sheep and goats, with 45 cases and 5 deaths.

3. The combined epidemiological statistics of both outbreaks in Hadidiya are:
Susceptible (sheep & goats) - 762
Cases - 60
Deaths - 17

4. Description of the affected population: A nomadic farm, 200 metres away from the first outbreak; this farm was vaccinated in response to the first outbreak but clinical signs started to appear on 20 Dec 2021; there is common grazing activities in this area. All dead animals are newborns and young animals in the flock, the clinical picture is still developing.

5. Laboratory results: FMD virus serotype O.

6. Epidemiological comments: The result of genotyping test was O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2/ANT-10.

7. Control measures at event level: movement control inside the country, quarantine, surveillance, vaccination in response to the outbreak(s).

8. A map presenting both outbreaks is included in the report [zoom-in will enable them to be discerned].

[Sudden deaths of juvenile sheep/goats, due to cardiac arrest (Tiger heart) are, at times, the only observed phenomenon in FMD-infected flocks.

Hadidiya is located on the margin of the Jordan Valley, a long and narrow trough, between the Sea of Galilee in the north and the Dead Sea in the south, known in Arabic as the Ghor (Al Ghor). The above focus of FMD is about 5 km from the Jordan river which separates the PA territory from the Kingdom of Jordan.

According to the recent report from Jordan, 2 of the FMD outbreaks there are located in the Ghor, several kilometers north east of Hadidiya (see archive 20211229.8700556). Remarkably, genotyping of the current Jordanian FMD virus has led to similar results as the genotyping of the PA virus. Both have been genotyped, by different laboratories, as FMDV O, topotype ME-SA, lineage PanAsia 2, sublineage ANT-10. This calls for further epidemiological and virological investigations, including studying the precise rate of similarity between the virus strains circulating on both sides of the Jordan River.

Between early 2018 and early 2021, all tested FMD strains from PA and Israel were genotyped O/ME-SA/PanAsia-2(QOM-15). The current strain is a different sub-lineage (ANT-10), probably indicative of a new introduction to the PA.

The areas along the banks of the Jordan river are known to be densely populated by wild boar, a species regarded as a prolific FMD virus amplifier and potential source of airborne spread of the virus. In certain weather and surface conditions, virus particles may reach relatively long distances. Studying this issue might require cooperation between veterinary, academic and wildlife institutions on both sides of the Jordan River. - Mod.AS
