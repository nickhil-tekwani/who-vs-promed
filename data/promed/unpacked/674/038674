Health Depts. Aim to Spot Bioterror
----------------
Public health officials have developed an odd interest lately in the
mundane and arcane.
Epidemiologists are tracking orange juice sales at the local Safeway and
poring over school attendance data. They're mapping every case of the
sniffles they can find and watching surveillance videos to count how many
times people sneeze.
The idea is that a sudden spike in everyday aches, pains, sniffles, and
coughs could signal the earliest stages of a health commissioner's worst
nightmare -- a massive biological attack. So in the last few years, an
increasing number of health departments have started collecting electronic
data from hospital emergency rooms, pharmacies, and other sources in an
effort to gauge the overall level of illness in the population.
Epidemiologists call their new strategy syndromic surveillance, because it
looks for increases in clusters of symptoms ("syndromes" in medical jargon)
rather than particular disease diagnoses. In September 2002, public health
officials from around the country met at the New York Academy of Medicine
to explore the potential of using syndromic surveillance as part of a
bioterror alarm system. The conference was organized by the New York City
health department with help from the Centers for Disease Control and
funding from the Sloan Foundation.
The new disease-tracking approach is also on the agenda at the American
Public Health Association annual meeting in Philadelphia 9-13 Nov 2002.
Last year's anthrax letter campaign was just "a tragic dry-run," Minnesota
state epidemiologist Michael Osterholm told his colleagues on the first
morning of the conference. "Do not under any circumstances be surprised
when the next shoe drops," Osterholm admonished. "It will drop."
And more than a year after the Sept. 11 attacks, the nation remains
woefully vulnerable to terrorist attacks of all kinds, a panel on homeland
security reported recently.
If it were to provide early warning of a bioterror attack, syndromic
surveillance might avert massive casualties. Even some of the deadliest
bioterror agents -- including anthrax, plague and smallpox -- can be
treated successfully if they are diagnosed early enough. But they also
progress quickly from mild symptoms to serious illness to death, so hours
count.
"There is the potential of a huge benefit if we really do get early
detection of a large bioterror event out of this," said Farzad Mostashari,
an assistant commissioner at the New York City health department.
Traditionally, health departments have relied on astute doctors to identify
bioterror attacks by diagnosis. That's how last fall's attacks came to
light; Dr. Larry M. Bush, a physician at JFK Medical Center in Atlantis,
Florida, identified anthrax infection in a supermarket tabloid photo editor.
"We don't pretend that the technology can replace man or that this is the
answer to everything," said Mostashari.
But doctors may not recognize such rare diseases as tularemia, Q fever, or
bubonic plague -- all potential bioterror agents. And one diagnosis would
not tell public health officials very much about the scope, geographic
location, or timing of an attack. So to supplement the eyes and ears of
individual physicians, some public health departments now monitor
everything from emergency room visits, 911 calls, and doctor visits to
school absenteeism and sales of cough syrup.
Public health has enjoyed a badly needed cash infusion in the year since
the World Trade Center and anthrax attacks. The Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention got $1.1 billion from Congress this year to beef up
bioterrorism defense. It is hard to say exactly how much of that money is
going to surveillance, but many experts believe spending a sizable chunk of
it on warning systems would be a good idea.
"For a long time it was very hard to get people to listen when you talked
about public health surveillance," said Margaret Hamburg, vice president
for biological programs at the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a Washington,
D.C., think tank. "Surveillance simply was not sexy and it was very poorly
understood."
Until recently, some researchers were skeptical that anything so apparently
trivial as cough syrup sales could indicate a significant jump in illness.
But researchers have shown that at least with the annual flu season, there
are a wealth of indicators that people are getting sick.
Elaine Newton, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, has done
studies showing that orange juice and paper tissue sales increase at the
onset of flu season. She has also found that Internet consumer health web
sites dealing with the flu get more hits a few days before a flu outbreak
is officially announced.
Now Newton is exploring the seemingly far-fetched idea of using
surveillance camera footage of public places to gauge the health of the
population, perhaps even by counting coughs and sneezes.
Such notions naturally raise the issue of privacy. The current systems do
not collect names or other identifying information, but Carnegie Mellon
computer scientist Latanya Sweeney said anybody who really wanted to
identify a person would probably be able to do so by combining data from
the bioterror system with facts culled from voter rolls or some other
public database.
New York has had a system since 1999. It analyzes information from hospital
emergency rooms, the 911 system, and ambulance dispatches for sudden
increases. The system also collects sales data from city drugstores and
absentee statistics from employers and schools as supplementary information.
Since June 2001, Seattle's public health department has analyzed reports
from 3 emergency rooms and 11 primary care clinics. The Seattle system also
monitors 911 dispatches, which are made available via the Internet by the
city's fire department.
Baltimore even collects information on dog and cat deaths from the city's
animal control department, and keeps track of school absenteeism and
over-the-counter cold medicine sales.
A system in western Pennsylvania collects information on every patient who
passes through the doors of 21 hospital emergency departments. It records
the age, gender, home ZIP code, time of admission, and chief complaint of
each patient, and looks for sudden increases in respiratory illness and
other symptoms that might indicate a bioterror attack. A version of the
Pennsylvania system was also set up in Utah for the 2002 Winter Olympics,
and has been operating there ever since.
Monitoring major public events for bioterrorism has become a challenging
subspecialty for designers of these early warning systems. In addition to
the 2002 Winter Olympics, systems have been set up for the 1999 World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle, both the Democratic and Republican party
conventions in 2000 and the 2001 World Series.
In October 2002 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention awarded a
$1.2 million grant to Harvard University researchers to begin developing a
national warning system that automatically collects information on the
number of patients with flu-like symptoms, strange rashes, and other
possible symptoms of bioterrorism.
The New York health department knows its surveillance system works because
it goes off all the time. A sudden increase in rashes at a particularly
busy emergency room is much more likely to be a random uptick than a
smallpox attack. A rise in fevers and coughs during November almost
certainly means "flu," not "anthrax."
For example, New York's system issued an alert the day American Airlines
Flight 587 crashed on takeoff from JFK airport, 2 months after the World
Trade Center attacks. The 2 hospitals nearest to the crash site were
reporting an unusually high number of patients with respiratory problems, a
possible indicator of an attack with anthrax or several other bioterror
agents. When investigators checked with the hospitals, they discovered
that the increase was due to a handful of factors, some related to the
plane crash and some incidental. There was one firefighter who had smoke
inhalation from responding to the crash, 2 cases of flu, 3 asthma attacks,
2 people complaining of chest pain, and one person who appeared upon
examination to be having an anxiety attack.
"We didn't really think there was a bioterrorism attack," said Mostashari,
who is credited with setting up the New York surveillance system. Even so,
he added, every suspicious pattern has to be investigated or the system
won't work.
"We do need something to give us a sense of the pulse of the city," said
Marcelle Layton, an assistant commissioner at the New York Department of
Health and Mental Hygiene.
For all its sensitivity, New York's system did not detect the anthrax
attacks last fall. Layton and her colleagues do not consider that a
problem, however, because the system is designed to detect major airborne
bioterror attacks. Last year's mail attacks were so limited that only one
of the 7 New Yorkers who contracted skin anthrax from contaminated letters
even visited an emergency room.

[ProMED-mail has covered 2 of the newer syndromic surveillance projects in
prior postings this year under this same thread (Disease surveillance:
enchancement) and subscribers are referred to these posts for detailed
coverage of the 2 systems: the RSVP system (Rapid Syndrome Validation
Project) and the RODS system (Real-Time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance).
This news article gives a nice overview of some of the projects presented
at the National Syndromic Surveillance Conference in September
2002. Having attended this conference, one of the messages I walked away
with was that at the present "state of the art" of syndromic surveillance,
with respect to its value in early detection of an intentional biologic
event, we are still very dependent upon the astute clinician(s) evaluating
the first patient(s) to get the appropriate diagnostic tests to confirm the
responsible organism. The value of the various systems to date has been to
identify increases in illness patterns (such as influenza-like-illness) a
few weeks before the traditional surveillance systems have (the "pneumonia
and influenza" systems) data supporting the existence of an outbreak. The
intentional anthrax incident was first identified by an astute clinician in
Florida. Several of the cutaneous cases had dates of onset preceding the
identification of the systemic anthrax case in Florida, but only after that
case was identified was the diagnosis of anthrax considered. The strength
of these systems is that they allow for real-time monitoring of the order
of magnitude of the problem once identified, and the geographic spread,
again, once the illness is identified.
Many of the presentations from the National Syndromic Surveillance
Conference held at the New York Academy of Medicine are available online.

In addition, as mentioned in the previous posting in this thread, there
were several presentations related to enhanced surveillance systems and
real-time reporting presented at the International Conference on Emerging
Infectious Diseases 2002. Readers are encouraged to view the webcasts of
