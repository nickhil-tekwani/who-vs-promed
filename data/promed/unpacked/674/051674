[The report doesn't state that the disease is in poultry, and there is so
little information given concerning the epidemiology of the outbreak, we
can only make assumptions. The species designation "avi" stands for birds
in the OIE reports. I won't assume which kind of bird the Albanians are
referring to, as many avian species are susceptible to Newcastle Disease.
Beside, we should not be left to make assumptions, as we all know what
happens when we assume!! - Mod.PC]
