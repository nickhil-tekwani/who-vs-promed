Officials in Rayalaseema are on alert as efficacy of the goat pox vaccine [given to the cattle for protection against] lumpy skin disease [LSD] in the region is reportedly not satisfactory, as some of the vaccinated cattle were [infected later].

The disease has affected the white milch cattle in all the districts of Rayalaseema. Every village in the districts of the region has reported 5 to 25 lumpy skin disease cases.

Anantapur Joint Director A.V. Ratnam Kumar and Sri Sathya Sai District Joint Director Animal Husbandry Subrahmanyam said that some non-descriptive breeds, including the Ongole breed, were the worst affected.

While there is no vaccine yet for lumpy skin disease, experts have advised administering goat pox vaccine to cattle since the symptoms of both lumpy skin and goat pox are similar.

[The goatpox vaccine, which has been recently applied in India for the protection of cattle against LSD, is likely to be based on the live-attenuated goatpox virus, Uttarkashi strain. This heterologous vaccine, produced by the government of Punjab, has been used locally in India and Bangladesh.

Experience gathered in the Balkans, Israel and other countries led the EU's expert panel to consider homologous (i.e., based on a virus strain derived from the same species) LSD vaccine as preferable for satisfactory protection of cattle, compared with heterologous vaccines, such as goat- or sheep-derived strains (see https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.2903/j.efsa.2020.6010). - Mod.AS
