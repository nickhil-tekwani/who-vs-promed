The mysterious illness reported in Mondoro in Douentza Cercle [Mopti region] has been confirmed by the non-governmental organisation [NGO] Médecins Sans Frontières. According to the NGO, 204 cases of the disease, including 161 in Douna and 43 Tiguila have been recorded. According to Dr Patrick Inengé samples have been taken from some patients because this pathology has already caused numerous deaths.

According to local officials, this pathology has already killed more than 40 people in the last 3 months and many people would be infected. According to them, the disease is manifested by the appearance of protuberances on the feet that spread gradually over the rest of the body.

[It is difficult to provide an educated guess of the etiology with so little information.

The sign "protuberances' on the feet" if an infectious disease, could be abscesses and pyoderma. However, pyoderma is not seen in outbreaks. Without ulcers and with a rapid spread and a high mortality, atypical mycobacterial infection such as Buruli ulcer seems less likely.

Bubonic plague is a possibility, but without fever (we do not know but it is not mentioned) and unlikely to start at the feet, but the mortality would be high.

If we assume that the condition starts on the feet because of some kind of exposure to the environment, cutaneous anthrax is a possibility, but would require contact with dead animals and the symptoms would be crusted sores. We need to know if livestock mortality has been unusually high over the last few months.

Contact with water could induce swimmer's itch due to invasion of _Schistosoma cercariae_, but in Mali most people would have been highly exposed (Mopti is located in the inland delta of the Niger River) and it does not have a high mortality.

ProMED-mail would appreciate more information from knowledgeable sources in the area; a photo of the condition would be very helpful. - Mod.EP
