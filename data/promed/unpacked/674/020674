Ticks blamed for horse deaths
-----------------------------
Necropsy results from 21 dead horses in the Gold Coast Hinterland have
revealed tick poisoning is to blame for the deaths. The
Toowoomba-owned horses died after they were sent for agistment to
Kooralbyn last week. Post-mortem examinations by Biosecurity
Queensland ruled out deliberate poisoning or foodborne disease
botulism as the cause.

Owner Debbie Lee said only 4 of the 25 horses were still alive. "The
surviving 4 have been given an anti-tick serum. Now we just have to
wait and see," she said. "But it's not hendra, it's not botulism and
it's not deliberate poisoning."

The revelation has been bitter-sweet for Ms Lee and partner Steve
Hogno, who have lost almost half of their racing stock. "It means the
remaining 30-odd horses we have in Toowoomba and Oakey have a clean
bill of health," Ms Lee said. "When I got the report, I told my
daughter that it restored my faith in mankind to realise that no one
out there is low enough to do such a horrible act."

Toowoomba and Oakey are classified as tick-free zones, with hefty
fines for taking tick-infested stock into the region.

"It means that if you take horses down near the coast, it pays to be
mindful," Ms Lee said. "They have no resistance to ticks because
they've never encountered them before."

Bouncing back will be hard, but the owners of Birdhouse Racing Stud
have vowed to do just that.

"It's as good news as it can be," Ms Lee said. "It's a huge knock to
us, but we'll never give up."

Ticks to blame for horse deaths -- media report
-----------------------------------------------
Ticks are behind the deaths of more than 20 horses at a property at
Kooralbyn, Queensland, The Chronicle reports.

Biosecurity Queensland has yet to released any official word on the
cause of the deaths, but paralysis ticks (_Ixodes holocyclus_) were
among the potential causes under investigation.

Other possibilities include a toxic weed, botulism and deliberate
poisoning.
The death toll now stands at 23 horses, Biosecurity Queensland said
yesterday, leaving just 2 of the original 25 horses alive. It said
test results were expected within a few days. The Chronicle said
necropsy results revealed tick poisoning was behind the deaths.

It said post-mortem examinations by Biosecurity Queensland had ruled
out deliberate poisoning and botulism.

The surviving horses -- 4 at the time of the report -- had been given
anti-tick serum, the newspaper said.

[These articles tell us what type of ticks but neither tells us which
specific disease. Ticks carry and transmit a variety of diseases. The
specific tick is often associated with a particular disease. The 2nd
article indicates the _Ixodes_ sp. is highest on the likely list of
possibilities (leading to tick paralysis); but there is no official
realease of a diagnosis. But clearly the disease is known if an
anti-serum is being given. Hopefully additional information will be
forthcoming. - Mod.TG]
