CHOLERA - THAILAND
==================
Date: Wed, 14 May 1997 06:10:19 +0700 (GMT+0700)

In Thailand we are also experiencing an outbreak of V. cholerae Ogawa that is
resistant not only to tetracycline but also to bactrim, streptomycin and
sulfasoxazole. This pattern of resistance is usually on a transposon. It
appears to be the same ro ribotyope but different from 0139 which for the
last 2 years has
disappeared.
I personally believe food as well as water plays an important role. Using
antibiotics rather than oral or IV therapy is not going to save anyone, but
IS going to lead to multi-antibiotic resistance by V.cholerae.
