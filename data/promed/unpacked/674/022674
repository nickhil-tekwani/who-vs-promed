The genetic characteristics of the live _Salmonella typhimurium_ vaccines
used for poultry in Germany given by Andre P. Burnens on Friday, 26 June
1998 are correct.
As a result of implementation of Council Directive 92/117/EEC, the German
regulations on Salmonella in chickens have provided for compulsory
vaccination of all laying hens during the rearing period for flocks of more
than 250 birds. Beside the two live _Salmonella typhimurium_ vaccines, two
inactivated _Salmonella enteritidis_ vaccines (Salenvac Â® ,Hoechst and
Talovac 109 SE, TAD Pharmazeutisches Werk GmbH, Cuxhaven, Germany) are
available.
The vaccination programmes are considered to be only one part of complex
control measures against Salmonella infections in poultry. The successful
control of Salmonella in poultry is fundamentally based on the use of good
hygiene and husbandry on the farm and include qualified management in
connection with strictly observed zoosanitary measures and additional
effective anti-infection measures , e.g. vaccination, or competitive
exclusion . To our experience, vaccination and competitive exclusion
represent effective prophylactic measures against Salmonella infections in
chickens.
Vaccination results in a further increase of resistance of birds against
Salmonella infection beyond the level of birds with developed intestinal
flora and leads to a decreased colonization of the intestine by Salmonella
challenge organisms. Also the invasion of Salmonella wild-type strains into
internal organs will be considerably diminished. This could [can? be shown
in experimental studies. Large scale monitoring programmes in layer flocks
in Germany showed evidently a reduction in occurence of _Salmonella
typhimurium_ wild-type strains after the beginning of the vaccination
programme (Vielitz 1993). Some cross protection effects between _Salmonella
typhimurium_ and _Salmonella enteritidis_ were detected but protective
effects between homologous Salmonella strains are expected to be
considerably higher. Vaccination should be considered as prophylactic
measure helping to reduce epidemiologically important serotypes of
Salmonella but not as curative treatment in infected flocks.
The reduction of Salmonella organisms in poultry is an important
prerequisite to reduce the exposure of salmonellas to human. However, the
hygienic standard during slaughter, processing of poultry meat and eggs as
well as the hygienic conditions during food preparation are also very
important for further multiplication of salmonellas in the different
products. Therefore, it is very difficult to evaluate the efficacy of
vaccination as one part in a complex of control measures concerning the
development of human cases of Salmonella infection. Although the number of
human cases of Salmonella in Germany decreased continuously after 1992, it
can not be estimated to which extent immunization of poultry with the live
and inactivated Salmonella vaccines within the whole complex of hygiene
and management contributed to this development.
