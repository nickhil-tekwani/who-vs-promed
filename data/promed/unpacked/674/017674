Skimmed milk is more likely to harbor bacteria such as _Salmonella_ and
_E.coli_ than full-fat milk, scientists disclosed yesterday. Anita
Rampling, of the Public Health Laboratory Service, said that many smaller
dairies used machines built before skimmed milk became popular. These
dairies skimmed off the cream and failed to pasteurize the remaining milk
properly.
Miss Rampling investigated 2 farms with a colleague where the machinery
had been modified, but subsequently failed a test to detect inadequately
treated milk. She said: "The flow-rate is speeded up, so the milk is not
held at high temperature for long enough."
The problem was compounded by the way milk was tested after the
pasteurization process. The test looked for phosphatase, an enzyme
supposed to be destroyed during the pasteurization process.
However, the phosphatase tended to bind to the fat in milk, most of which
was removed when the cream was skimmed off, so that low-fat milk could
test negative for the enzyme even if it was not pasteurized properly. A
Food Standards Agency spokesman said: "There have been problems with
on-farm pasteurization in the past, but we are not aware of this
particular problem."
Ted Langridge, an independent food science consultant, said the law
should be changed to ensure all milk underwent a more rigorous test.
