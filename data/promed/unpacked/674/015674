Structure and scope of report, Executive summary issued by the British
Medical Association <http://www.bma.org.uk/news/news.htm>

Structure and scope of report [released on Thursday, 21 January, 1999]
The aim of the report is to consider new developments in biotechnology,
especially human genetics, which could be incorporated into the available
weaponry of nation states and terrorist organisations. In particular, the
report considers whether weapons could be based on genetic knowledge and if
so, how legislation and other measures could prevent such a malign use of
scientific knowledge.
