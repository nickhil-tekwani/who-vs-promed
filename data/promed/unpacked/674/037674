Hospital worker charged over hepatitis outbreak
-----------------------------------------------
A US hospital worker accused of injecting himself with stolen drugs and contaminating syringes that infected at least 30 patients with hepatitis C has been charged with federal drug crimes.

A former technician at Exeter Hospital, was arrested today at a Massachusetts hospital where he was receiving treatment. US Attorney John Kacavas called [this technician] a "serial infector" who worked in at least 6 other states, including one in which he is a suspect in a similar incident involving a hospital operating room. Kacavas declined to name any of the other states but said they are not clustered in one part of the country. "We are closer to the beginning of our investigation than the end," Kacavas said.

[The technician], originally from Michigan, worked at Exeter's cardiac catheterisation lab from April 2011 through this past May [2012], when he was fired. He told investigators that he learned he had hepatitis C in May, but Kacavas said there is evidence that he had the liver-destroying disease since at least June 2010.

"This serial infecter has been contained and the menace he posed to public health and safety has been removed," Kacavas said. Authorities didn't say in what hospital [the technician] was being treated so he couldn't be contacted for comment.

Investigators believe [the technician, a 33 year old male], stole syringes containing fentanyl, a powerful aesthetic more potent than morphine, and injected himself with them. They said he then put another liquid, such as saline, into the syringes, which were later used for patients. They said a search of his vehicle found an empty fentanyl syringe and several needles. According to an affidavit, [he] sometimes left the lab sweating profusely and attended procedures on his off days. One witness said he appeared to be "on something." At least once, he was sent home for the day after a colleague told a supervisor that he was unfit to perform medical care, Kacavas said.

[This technician] was what is known as a "traveller," a technician hired by hospitals for temporary stints around the country. In a statement, Exeter Hospital said he underwent drug testing and a criminal background check when he was hired. "It is deeply disturbing that the alleged callous acts of one individual can have such an impact on so many innocent lives. As a result of his alleged actions, people in our community, who in many cases are the friends and neighbours of the 2300 people who work here, now face the challenge of a potentially chronic disease," hospital president Kevin Callahan said. The hospital declined to comment further about [the technician], citing the ongoing investigation.

Hepatitis C is a blood-borne viral infection that can cause liver disease and chronic health issues. Altogether, 31 people, including [the technician], have tested positive for the same strain of the [virus] since the investigation began in late May [2012], including an 89-year-old woman who was treated for a heart valve problem in February [2012]. The woman lives with her niece, who also got tested for hepatitis C because she was exposed to the woman's blood while helping her after she suffered a deep cut on her leg in April [2012]. The niece's test was negative, but she will get tested again in 6 months. The niece, who asked not to be publicly identified because of the stigma associated with the disease and because she wants to protect her aunt from the media, said she hopes the criminal charges will deter others from similar schemes. She said she was happy to hear that [the technician] had been arrested.

State and local health departments aren't required to report such outbreaks to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), but in a report released in June [2012], the agency said it was notified of 13 outbreaks nationwide between 2008 and 2011. Of those, 7 occurred in outpatient facilities; most were traced to unsafe injection practices. At least 2 have resulted in criminal charges, including a Colorado woman who was convicted of stealing syringes filled with painkillers from 2 hospitals where she worked and replacing them with used syringes. The syringes were later used on surgical patients, and up to 3 dozen patients were found to have hepatitis C after being exposed.

Kacavas said New Hampshire is working with the CDC, law enforcement, and departments of public health in other states where [this technician] worked. "I'm unaware of such a scheme with such reach," he said. "This one has the potential for very far-reaching implications."

[Features of this incident remain unexplained. It is disquieting that a locum technician had access to fentanyl-filled syringes and was able to replace them undetected. Were these syringes refilled and used in other or the same cardiovascular procedures? That the technician was able to do this suggests laxity in the hospital's disease control procedures. Have there been similar incidents in any of the other hospitals where the technician worked prior to this incident? The locations of these other hospitals where the technician worked previously and his role should made public if only to allay fears of wider spread of hepatitis C virus infection.
