The Director of the Hipolito Yrigoyen Hospital, Ramon Enrique Medina, confirmed in the media that a 2-year-old girl died in the Oran hospital and that investigations continue because it appears that she contracted [a] hantavirus [infection].

Dr Medina stated that the corresponding tests are being done on [samples from] the girl, and results are awaited in order to know whether she died of this or another cause.

The health professional reminded everyone that only prevention of the disease is possible, but it cannot be cured, and there are no vaccines or drugs to combat it. Last year [2012], an woman died in the same locality due to the disease.

[It is curious that no mention was made of the occurrence of a non-fatal hantavirus infection in a 29-year-old man in the Oran area earlier this year (2013). The circumstances under which the girl became infected are not mentioned either, which would be of interest should the test confirm a hantavirus infection.

Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2012). The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive number 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but Oran virus seems like a good possibility, since the case occurred in Oran municipality.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Oran hantavirus, can be seen at http://calphotos.berkeley.edu/imgs/512x768/0000_0000/0711/1260.jpeg.
