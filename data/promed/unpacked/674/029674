North Georgia District Environmental Health officials are perplexed
as to how a puppy from the Cherry Log area has recently tested
positive for rabies after it was given to a Murray County resident,
according to Public Information Officer Jennifer Moorer.

Murray County Environmental Health officials 1st learned of the case
when a resident reported on 13 Jul 2008 that she had been bitten by
her new puppy, said Jason Osgatharp, Murray County environmental
health director.

The resident who was bitten told environmental health officials that
she recently obtained the puppy from a resident of the Goose Island
area of Cherry Log, near the Fannin-Gilmer County Line, Osgatharp
said.

Murray County Environmental Health officials obtained the puppy on 14
Jul 2008 and sent it for testing at the state laboratory in Decatur.
Positive results were returned on 15 Jul 2008, Osgatharp said.

As a result, Osgatharp said the 3 Murray County residents involved
have been told to seek further advice from their doctors about
receiving the post-exposure [prophylactic] treatment for rabies.

Making matters more complex, a 2nd puppy from Cherry Log -- a
confirmed litter mate of the rabid puppy -- was given to a family in
Johnson County at some point between 3 and 13 Jul 2008 Moorer said.

The Johnson County residents with the litter mate are currently
deciding whether to quarantine the puppy for 6 months in the
state-mandated, double-penned enclosure or to euthanize it, Moorer
said.

The puppy in Johnson County has not shown any signs of rabies, Moorer said.

Both puppies were originally transported, without their mother, from
the Chattanooga area to the Cherry Log resident in June 2008, Moorer
said.

Before they were given away, both puppies were kept with an
unrelated, vaccinated adult dog. The Cherry Log resident reported
that all of the animals got into a fight with a raccoon on 21 Jun
2008, Moorer said.

The confusing part for environmental health officials is that the
raccoon from the fight in Cherry Log was submitted for testing on 23
Jun 2008, and negative results were returned on 24 Jul 2008, Moorer
said.

The test for rabies is 100 percent accurate, according to state
epidemiologists.

With the typical incubation period of rabies in a dog being about 30
days, Moorer said environmental health officials suspect the puppy
contracted rabies before it arrived in Cherry Log.

The adult dog involved in the fight with the raccoon was currently
vaccinated, and both puppies were just shy of being old enough to
receive rabies vaccinations, Moorer said.

In an effort to solve the mystery of how and why the Murray County
puppy tested positive, lab tests are being done by the U.S. Centers
for Disease Control to determine whether the puppy had the specific
"raccoon variant" of rabies, Moorer said.

Environmental health officials are also working to try to locate the
mother of the pups, Moorer said.

"It's all been a little bit hard to sort out in this case," Gilmer
County Environmental Health Director Andrea Wheeler said.

The results of the CDC's testing "may take a long time to come back,"
Moorer said.

To report a suspected rabid animal or rabies exposure in Fannin
County, call the Fannin County Environmental Health Department at

to retest them. - Mod.TG]
