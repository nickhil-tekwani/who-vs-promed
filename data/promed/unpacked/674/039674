ProMED-mail has received a few messages and I have received a few telephone
calls regarding various aspects of the use of PCR for surveillance. We are
not posting them but, instead, I am summarizing my understanding of the
situation.
One problem with subcontracting surveillance work, or even an aspect of
surveillance work, is that data become dissipated. That is, there is no
central focus for reporting of results, thus no centralized understanding
of the situation at any given period.
A problem with use of PCR as the sole means of detection of virus is that
arthropods (usually mosquitoes or ticks) can pick up a small quantity of
virus when blood-feeding and, when tested for viral nucleic acid (viral RNA
for most arboviruses), provide a positive assay result. This means neither
that virus has been amplified in the arthropod nor that the arthropod is
competent to transmit the virus, nor that, even were it competent, virus
titer in the arthropod is sufficiently high to infect the vertebrate host
on which that arthropod might have subsequently fed.
A number of groups, including the CDC, have developed PCR assays for
detection of St. Louis encephalitis virus. However, without confirmatory
tests such as virus isolation (the ostensible sine qua non of diagnostic
virology) and testing of sentinel birds (chickens or house sparrow,
usually) by immunofluorescence assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays,
etc., a positive PCR alone cannot be taken as a definitive answer to the
question: "Is there virus circulating in arthropods in this area?". Such
work must be published in a peer-reviewed journal before it can be accepted
as reliable and meaningful.
The absence of seroconversions in sentinels (usually chickens) in the
presence of human infections can mean any of a number of things, none of
which I am going into here.
Seroconversions in sentinels without concurrent SLE infections in humans
also occurs, but that is easier to explain.
It might be an appropriate time for CDC or others to convene a meeting to
decide which methods can and should be used for surveillance. The Division
of vector-Borne Infectious Diseases of CDC/Ft. Collins produced an
excellent set of guidelines six years ago (Moore, C.G., R.G. McLean, C.J.
Mitchell, R.S. Nasci, T.F. Tsai, C.H. Calisher, A.A. Marfin, P.S. Moore,
and D.J. Gubler. Guidelines for arbovirus surveillance programs in the
United States. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA.,
1993) but I have no idea whether these guidelines have been used or not.
In any event, ProMED-mail cannot be in the business of making or evaluating
such recommendations, so we will cut this fascinating and important string
here.
