A total of 9 people have been treated in Health Centers of La Rioja for an outbreak of Q fever, and 3 of them have been admitted, according to various local media. This disease is a zoonosis that is transmitted by inhalation of the bacteria present in infected animals.

In addition, 3 citizens of the Basque Country, specifically from Biscay, are also admitted with Q fever, and a 4th person is waiting for bacteriological results. The patients would have acquired the disease after a visit to La Rioja, where they would have been infected by having contact with infected animals. They spent a weekend in La Rioja, and all of them, during a rural stay, maintained direct contact with newborn goats.

The spread of Q fever does not occur from person to person but only occurs through direct contact with sick animals. Therefore, the disease, caused by the bacterium _Coxiella burnetii_, has implications for animal health, especially for livestock, and infections can also be caused by the inhalation of bacterial spores that can be transported long distances by dust and wind.

Acute cases of Q fever are often mild, with symptoms similar to those of the flu, and can be treated with antimicrobials. However, chronic cases can cause dangerous infections in the heart and blood vessels and have a poor prognosis.

Recently, the Valencian Ministry of Health reported the existence of another outbreak of Q fever in Villajoyosa (Alicante), with 6 cases declared, all of them now in good health.

[Q fever is due to _Coxiella burnetii_, an obligate intracellular rickettsia-like bacterial pathogen. It is highly resistant to drying and heat, which enables the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. Its survival is attributed to a small cell variant of the organism that is part of its biphasic developmental cycle.

Q fever is a zoonosis. Although it has a wide and diverse host range, in animals this organism is primarily known as a cause of reproductive losses in domesticated ruminants. Clinical cases seem to be most significant in sheep and goats, with sporadic losses and occasional outbreaks that may affect up to 50-90% of the herd. Infected animals can be difficult to recognize: nonpregnant animals do not seem to have any obvious clinical signs, and seropositivity is not always correlated with shedding of the bacteria. The organism is shed in urine, feces, milk, and especially birthing products; intermittent high-level shedding occurs at the time of parturition, with millions of bacteria being released per gram of placenta.

Humans usually become infected by inhaling aerosolized organisms, often when they are exposed to an animal that had aborted but also if birth was at term and seemed normal. Acute symptoms of a flu-like illness usually develop within 2-3 weeks of exposure, although as many as half of humans infected with _C. burnetii_ do not show symptoms (http://www.cdc.gov/qfever/symptoms/index.html). Although most persons with acute Q fever infection recover, others may experience serious illness with complications that may include pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, endocarditis (especially in patients with previous cardiac valvulopathy), myocarditis, and central nervous system involvement. Pregnant women who are infected may be at risk for pre-term delivery or miscarriage.

Q fever is frequently an occupationally acquired illness; people most at risk include workers from the meat and livestock industries, shearers, veterinarians, laboratory personnel performing _C. burnetii_ cultures, as well as the general population in close proximity to infected animals in stockyards, feedlots, processing plants, or farms. - Mod.LL
