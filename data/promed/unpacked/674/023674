Rodents suspected in spread of avian flu
----------------------------------------
Scientists suspect rats spread the recent outbreaks of avian flu at 4
farms in Miyazaki and Okayama prefectures after the H5N1 virus strain
was brought over by migratory birds from China. The experts agree
that the migratory birds triggered the infections at the 4 poultry
farms over the past month [January-February 2007]. But they said at a
meeting Wednesday [14 Feb 2007] that the way the disease spread
indicates that other factors were involved.
Inspectors found that nets and coverings were in place to prevent
large migratory birds from coming into contact with the poultry. In
addition, dead chickens at 3 of the farms were found in areas
farthest from the entrance of the coops, so the wild birds were not
likely the direct source of the infection. "It's possible that small
rodents, such as rats, carried the virus into the chicken coops,"
said Toshihiro Ito, a professor of veterinary microbiology at Tottori
University, who chairs the team of specialists. He said the rats were
likely infected by the wild birds from China.
The task force, appointed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Fisheries, said the H5N1 strain at the 4 farms was identical to
the one that killed thousands of wild birds at Qinghai Lake in
western China starting in 2005. The strain was also similar to one
found in duck droppings in South Korea in January [2007]. "It is
possible the virus was brought to western Japan by a route that went
through China and the Korean Peninsula," Koichi Otsuki, a professor
of veterinary microbiology at Kyoto Sangyo University, said.
According to specialists, migratory birds follow 3 main routes in
winter. One route passes over Hokkaido, another crosses the Sea of
Japan, and the 3rd goes through the Korean Peninsula.
Ducks are believed to be the likely carriers of avian flu because
most ducks are not affected by the disease. However, the avian flu
virus multiplies in the intestines of ducks and is released in their
droppings. An Environment Ministry study confirmed that wild ducks
were within a 10-km. radius of the infected farms in Japan. Nets and
other measures at the farms in Japan should have been enough to keep
out large wild birds, like ducks, but rats and small birds could
still enter the coops.
If the specialists confirm that rats were indeed the carriers of
avian flu, it would be very difficult to avoid similar outbreaks.
"While it is necessary to prevent intrusion, it is also important to
strengthen the resistance of poultry by reducing stress on the birds
and improving ventilation (in the coops) to diffuse and inactivate
the virus," said Hiroshi Kida, a professor of veterinary microbiology
at Hokkaido University. As to whether the virus might mutate into one
that affects humans, Nobuhiko Okabe, director of the Infectious
Disease Surveillance Center of the National Institute of Infectious
Diseases, said, "While there is no need to become overly concerned,
we also cannot let our guard down." He said early discovery and
culling of infected poultry should keep the possibility of mutations
in Japan low.

[Two points:
Speculating about wild rodents is facile but proving their
involvement takes more than imagination in the absence of other
likely hypotheses. That the affected birds on 3 farms were at points
furthest from the entrances makes one stop and think as to what might
have been a common factor, other than "rodents."
In among the various papers I wrote on the 1967-68 foot & mouth
disease epidemic was one on the possible part played by farm rodents:
(Hugh-Jones, M.E. 1970. Epidemiologic Studies on the 1967/68
Foot-and-Mouth Disease Epidemic. The possible spread of infection by
farm rats (Rattus norvegicus). Br. Vet. J. 126: 368-71). At that
time the MAFF [Ministry of Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry]
outbreak forms had a question on farm rodents and hedgehogs --
sometimes government forms owe more to history than science -- but
because of the perceived risk from itinerant rodents, an active
programme of rodent eradication was in place. This I mined for the
rodent status of each farm visited. I could show no difference in
subsequent nearby FMD incidence between infested and uninfested
FMD-affected farms. - Mod.MHJ]

Veterinary risk assessment for the animal health risks of HPAI
[highly pathogenic avian Influenza] potentially infected poultry meat
--------------------------------------------------
This document should be read in full but the key points are:
In conclusion, the available evidence does not demonstrate
conclusively that infected poultry meat may have entered the UK from
Hungary. Hungarian authorities have confirmed that turkeys were not
sourced from their restricted areas. However, if it did, then only a
single batch is likely to have been affected. The specific tissues
imported are likely to contain low levels of virus.
Risk management measures as explained above are already in place to
deal with the background level of risk that foodstuffs may contain
low, undetected levels of virus liable to cause animal disease.
There is a low likelihood that infected poultry meat is present in
the UK. There are already measures in place to mitigate this level of
animal health risk so it would be disproportionate and unnecessary to
trace and dispose of Hungarian meat.

1. H5N1 Avian Influenza in poultry, Upper Holton, Suffolk
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/disease/ai/latest-situation/index.htm>:
On Sat 3 February 2007, highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza was
confirmed on a poultry farm in Holton, Suffolk. A 3-km. Protection
Zone and 10-km. Surveillance Zone were imposed along with a wider
Restricted Zone. The humane slaughter of the 159 000 birds on site
began the same day, under the supervision of the State Veterinary
Service (SVS) and was completed on the evening of Mon 5 February 2007.
