Udupi district [Karnataka state] is famous for a type of green
brinjal [eggplant, aubergine]. For the past 2 years, brinjal
cultivation faced a setback. Dr Shivanna, Zonal Agricultural Research
Station, said, "Farmers of the region were facing difficulty in
raising the seedlings because the crop was affected by a soil-borne
disease called bacterial wilt. The disease also forced farmers to
look for other alternatives."

Shivanna is creating a new technique raising the seedlings on
[coconut] coir piths readily available in the market. "These plants,
once transplanted, are immune to diseases for about 30-40 days after
which the disease does not affect the plant much," explains Dr Shivanna.

Dr Shivanna said, "Initially this experiment was conducted on one
farm. Next year we are planning to implement the same on about 15
acres [6 ha] of land. Also, we would like to train farmers to be self reliant."

The village grows approximately 15 to 20 tons of brinjal annually,
which is largely exported to Bangalore and the Gulf where there is a
huge demand for the vegetable.

[Bacterial wilt (BW) caused by _Ralstonia solanacearum_ is a very
severe soilborne disease of aubergine (_Solanum melongena_) in parts
of India. Symptoms include wilting of the terminal leaves and
eventually the whole plant, followed by stunting, production of large
numbers of adventitious roots on the stem, and often death of the
plant. Resistant varieties of aubergine are being developed and used
mainly as rootstocks in BW affected areas.

_R. solanacearum_ invades the roots of diverse plant hosts from the
soil and aggressively colonises the xylem vessels causing lethal
wilting diseases. It is widely distributed and economically important
affecting more than 200 plant species. It affects important crops
such as banana (moko, blood, and bugtok diseases) and potato (brown
rot), as well as causing bacterial wilts of peanut, tomato, and other
vegetables. _R. s._ has been classified into various races and
biovars active under different climatic conditions and affecting
different hosts. The bacteria are spread by mechanical means,
infected plant and other material, and most probably insects.

The success of the cultural method described above is likely to be
due to the reduction of the amount of bacterial soil inoculum to
which the seedlings are exposed, and also to the protection of the
young plants against insects carrying bacteria from outside sources.
