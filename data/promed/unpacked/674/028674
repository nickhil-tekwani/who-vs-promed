Foot-and-mouth started by 16 sheep
-----------------------------------
16 sheep spread foot-and-mouth disease across Britain, the Government's
chief vet said. Investigations into the origins of the epidemic in which
almost 6 million animals died and 9000 farms had their livestock eliminated
showed that an initial case at a pig farm in Northumberland went unreported
for several weeks, Jim Scudamore told the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs Committee.
During that period, the virus infected a handful of sheep farms. From
these, 6 went to a dealer in Lancashire and 10 went through markets in
Northumberland and Cumbria, probably infecting thousands of animals
directly or indirectly. Waves of secondary and tertiary infection then
spread across the country.
The work, to be published as a scientific paper, is likely to have a
profound effect on farming in Britain. In the long term, he told the
committee, every sheep is likely to carry an electronic ear tag identifying
its origin and movements. There may be rules to slow down movement of
animals, especially sheep, including a requirement an animal moved to a
farm must stay there for 3 weeks.
The disease may even see the end of the traditional livestock market. "The
ideal is a situation in which animals are sold without mixing," he said.
"The pig industry operates already without markets. People are
experimenting with alternatives such as video auctions." Direct sales are
also a possibility. That in itself could have a huge knock-on effect on
market towns throughout Britain.
