Measles is rapidly spreading in the flooded town of Pibor and surrounding areas, severely affecting young children, Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) warned today [4 Nov 2020], calling for health organizations to urgently carry out a measles vaccination campaign.

MSF treated the 1st children with suspected measles in central Pibor town in August [2020], and the outbreak has grown significantly since then. From August to October [2020], MSF treated more than 250 children and is currently treating 30 children with severe measles in its Pibor health facility. Patients are increasingly coming from farther away in the surrounding Greater Pibor Administrative Area, as people walk and paddle through stagnant and moving floodwaters, sometimes for up to 7 days.

"We believe measles is now widespread and getting out of control," said Adelard Shyaka, an MSF doctor in Pibor. "It is especially concerning that the Greater Pibor Administrative Area is flooded in a larger emergency. The severity of the situation is magnified by other illnesses, including severe malaria, pneumonia and severe malnutrition. Two children have already died of measles, and we are deeply concerned that without a prompt reactive vaccination campaign, more children will die."

Measles is a highly contagious disease that is transmitted through the air. Malnourished children under the age of 5 are more likely to develop severe measles, with serious and even fatal complications, including severe diarrhea, pneumonia, blindness or encephalitis.

There is no specific treatment for measles, but a well-conducted vaccination campaign is extremely effective in preventing new cases. In areas like Pibor with large-scale movement of people and low immunization rates due to insecurity and logistical challenges, vaccination can reduce infant mortality by 50%.

Pibor and the surrounding area experienced intercommunal conflicts earlier this year [2020], and many people were displaced by the violence before being displaced again by flooding. Children in Pibor are now living in close contact to each other, increasing the risks of transmission.

"With the floods, many communities are clustered on small islands of dry land," said Josh Rosenstein, MSF coordinator in Pibor. "This is the moment to vaccinate as many children as possible through small mobile teams visiting these small islands. If it does not happen now, the water levels will start to decrease, and people will start to return to their homes elsewhere. This is the best chance that we have at controlling the disease outbreak."

MSF has been calling on health organizations in South Sudan to urgently implement a widescale reactive vaccination campaign since 31 Aug [2020], when 6 measles cases were confirmed by laboratory testing. It is the 3rd measles outbreak in Pibor in the last 12 months, and MSF is struggling to control it while simultaneously responding to multiple health emergencies in the area.

MSF is not able to do more. In the last 11 weeks, MSF has treated more than 15 624 patients in and around Pibor, including 6290 children under the age of 5. More than half of these patients have been treated for malaria: a number far above normal for this time of year. MSF has also treated 1700 children under 5 for respiratory tract infections and 699 for watery diarrhea and is responding to rapidly increasing numbers of patients with malnutrition.

MSF teams are delivering healthcare through 6 mobile clinics in villages on the periphery of Pibor and a health facility in the town. MSF is also supporting water and sanitation activities, distributing about 60 000 liters of water daily.

As a medical humanitarian organization, MSF has been working in the region that is now South Sudan since 1983 and currently works in 14 locations throughout the country.

[Also see this WHO Africa update from 4 Feb 2020: https://www.afro.who.int/news/south-sudan-launches-nationwide-campaign-protect-25-million-children-against-measles. The following has been excerpted from the report:

With the aim of vaccinating 2.5 million children against measles, a nationwide vaccination campaign is kicked off today (4 Feb 2020). The campaign is a cooperation between the Ministry of Health, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other partners. In addition to the vaccine, the children will also receive vitamin A supplement and deworming tablets.

The campaign is essential for children's health in South Sudan, as the country is still battling an unprecedented measles outbreak with over 4700 confirmed cases and 26 deaths since January 2019 to date. Vaccination is the most effective way to protect children against this very contagious disease. Vitamin A and deworming are crucial for children's immune system and ability to fight diseases in addition to prevent blindness.

"We need to boost the vaccination coverage to protect children against measles outbreaks", said Dr. Makur Matur Kariom, Undersecretary, Ministry of Health. "Unfortunately, in South Sudan routine vaccination coverage against measles remains low at only 59%. That means many children in our country are not protected against the disease. Hence the importance of this vaccination campaign cannot be over emphasized."

The campaign will run in 2 phases. The 1st phase starts today (4 Feb 2020) and will cover almost 70% of the counties in the former Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, Jonglei, Lakes, Norther Bahr el Ghazal, Western Bahr el Ghazal, Unity, Warrap and Upper Nile, while the 2nd phase will cover the remaining counties in Central Equatoria, Jonglei, Unity and upper Nile and end on 17 Mar 2020. Not only unvaccinated children can receive the vaccine; also children who only have received one dose are welcome.

"The campaign will contribute to the reduction of illness and death due to measles. The measles virus is highly infectious. It can cause rashes, eye infection, respiratory infections, diarrhea and even death," said Dr. Olushayo Olu, WHO Representative in South Sudan. "We are committed to support the Ministry of Health to attain over 95% coverage to be able interrupt the prevalence of this deadly disease virus in South Sudan."

Large proportions of the targeted populations are in hard to reach areas. Yet, the partners have planned for vaccination posts throughout the country, also in areas where access to health services is poorer.

It's not clear whether the Pibor area was included in this vaccination campaign, but it appears from this growing outbreak that possibly the remoteness of the region may have made an effective level of vaccination difficult to achieve. - Mod.LK
