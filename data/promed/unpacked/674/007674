Community Cluster of Legionnaires' Disease in France, 2000
----------------------------------------------------------
Between the end of July and 15 Nov 2000, 19 cases of legionnaires' disease
(5 fatal) were reported in Rennes, in northwest France. _Legionella
pneumophila_ serogroup 1 was isolated from 7 cases: the French National
Reference Centre has reported that the 7 strains share the same genomic
profile. The European Working Group on Legionella Infection has been
informed.
The source of infection is unknown. Preliminary investigations indicated
that most cases visited or lived in Rennes. A case control study and
environmental investigations are under way. Eurosurveillance Weekly
reported 2 weeks ago on several community outbreaks of legionnaires'
disease in Spain.
