At the end of September 2005, an outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_
serotype] Typhimurium DT104 infections was detected in the
Netherlands by the Dutch National Salmonella Center. From 19 Sep to 7
No 2005, 165 extra cases of serotype Typhimurium DT104 infection were
recorded, by far exceeding the usual number for this time period of
about 15 cases [For figure see original URL - Mod.LL]. The Dutch
national salmonella surveillance relies on the regional public health
laboratories, which cover about 64 percent of the Dutch population,
submitting bacterial isolates to the National Institute for Public
Health and Environment (Rijkinstituut voor Volksgezondheid en Milieu,
RIVM) for sero- and phage typing. The number of new cases declined
during Nov 2005 and reached normal levels by the end of the month.
Investigation
-------------
The cases were dispersed throughout the Netherlands and males and
females were equally represented. The age distribution of cases was
shifted towards the ages 6-20 years compared to data from previous
years. Data from preliminary interviews with 19 patients using a
structured questionnaire suggested beef as the infection source;
however, no particular food items stood out as undisputable vehicles.
The majority of the bacterial isolates had the same antibiotic
resistance profile, i.e. resistant to amoxicillin, tetracycline,
chloramphenicol, sulphamethoxazole and sometimes trimethoprim but
sensitive to ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. A subset of isolates was
typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multiple-locus
variable-number tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA). The latter method was
recently presented as more discriminatory than PFGE when typing DT104
isolates (1). The molecular typing indicated clonality of the
outbreak isolates and suggested a link to a recent outbreak of
serotype Typhimurium DT104 in Denmark, linked to beef from Italy (2).
A portion of the incriminated original beef batch (from Italy) has
now been traced in Holland and is currently being sampled.
Implications
-------------
With 165 laboratory-confirmed cases, this is a large outbreak -- even
more so considering that this is probably only the tip of the
iceberg. In earlier studies in the Netherlands it was found that
laboratory-confirmed cases should be multiplied by about 23 to reach
the estimated total number of clinical cases due to the infection in
the general population (i.e., close to 4000 in the present outbreak).
Notwithstanding a possibility for international spread, 2 Enter-Net
postings have not elicited any reports of increased incidence of
DT104 salmonellosis from any other European countries apart from the
recent outbreak in Denmark.
As salmonellosis is not notifiable in the Netherlands, various
permissions have to be obtained before a patient can be contacted,
which is why only a small initial group of patients have so far been
interviewed with the structured questionnaire. A more specific
beef-oriented case-control study (120 cases, 480 controls) has been
started this week.

[DT104 has also been reported recently from Norway. This following
discussion is adapted from the USA Department of Agriculture website.
<http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPHS/stdt104.htm>
"Salmonellosis due to serotype Typhimurium DT104 is an emerging
foodborne pathogen detected in several countries worldwide including:
the USA, the UK, Canada, Germany, France, Austria, and Denmark. Of
particular concern with DT104 is the presence of a multiple
antimicrobial resistance pattern (R-Type) to ampicillin,
chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline
(ACSSuT). Molecular studies have demonstrated that in this strain,
resistance genes are chromosomally encoded. This is important because
removal of the selective pressure from antibiotics is not expected to
reverse resistance, as it might with extrachromosomal-mediated resistance.
Also of concern is the increasing trend of additional resistance of
DT104 to trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin (a fluoroquinolone), which
has occurred in the UK. In the USA, DT104 R-type ACSSuT has been
isolated from poultry, swine, cattle, and other domestic and wild animals.
DT104 is an animal pathogen and a foodborne pathogen of humans. The
mortality rate for clinically affected cattle with this strain is
reported to be 40-60 percent in some outbreaks in the UK. The case
fatality rate in humans may be higher than with other Salmonella
infections. In a study of 83 DT104 cases in the United Kingdom, 41
percent of patients were hospitalized and 3 percent died. In
contrast, the case-fatality rate for other nontyphoid Salmonella
infections was approximately 0.1 percent. In the USA, serotype
Typhimurium R-type ACSSuT infections have been more likely to cause
bacteremia and have been associated with longer hospitalizations. No
increase in mortality has been observed.
Recent antibiotic use in humans and animals is a predisposing factor
for serotype Typhimurium DT104 infection. This has been observed in
other enteric bacterial pathogens as well. Killing the competitive
gut flora may allow unrestricted growth of a pathogen. In addition,
the use of antibiotics to treat infection prolongs the carrier state
of DT104 in humans and animals. Both of these features indicate a
need to educate physicians, veterinarians, and the public about the
potential adverse consequences of indiscriminate antibiotic use.
The best prospect for minimizing human illness is a strategy of
barriers to introduction and multiplication of DT104 throughout the
farm-to-table continuum. Control measures that are effective against
other types of _Salmonella spp_ will reduce the likelihood of
transmission of serotype Typhimurium DT104." - Mod.LL]
[In the above report, there is mention of a recent outbreak of
_salmonella [enterica_ serotype] typhimurium_ DT104 in Denmark linked
to beef imported from Italy. Of interest is that ProMED-mail posting
Salmonella typhimurium DT104, beef - Norway ex Poland 20051111.3296
in mid November 2005 was associated with beef imported from
Poland. One wonders if a major traceback on the origin of the
beef/cattle associated with these 3 outbreaks will lead to a common
producer in the region. - Mod.MPP].
