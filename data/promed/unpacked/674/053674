Human cases of West Nile virus illness exceed 200: 46 new cases reported,
including 4 new counties
-------------------------------------
Human cases of West Nile virus illness in Illinois now total 211 [9 fatal]
with the addition today of 46 new cases of the mosquito-transmitted
disease, the Illinois Department of Public Health has announced.
Human cases have now been identified in 21 of the state's 102 counties,
including 4 counties -- Crawford, Kane, Lake, and Stephenson -- that today
reported their first cases.
"How long this outbreak will continue depends on many factors, including
the weather and the extent to which we can adequately control the mosquito
population," said Dr John R Lumpkin, state public health director. "The
biggest influence on human cases, however, will be whether or not people
follow the precautions that have been recommended, such as using repellent
and doing the common sense things they can do to avoid mosquito bites."
The new cases reported today include 13 from the city of Chicago, 25 from
suburban Cook County, 2 from St Clair County, and one each from Crawford,
Effingham, Kane, Lake, Stephenson, and Will counties. West Nile virus
illness in Illinois has been reported in people ranging in age from 2 to
92, but serious illness is most often present in individuals 50 years of
age or older.

The state has reported 9 nine fatalities due to West Nile virus illness: a
67 year old man from DuPage County; women aged 92, 89, 83, and 67 years
from suburban Cook County; an 83 year old man and an 82 year old woman from
Chicago; a 71 year old man from Effingham County; and a 79 year old woman
from Moultrie County.
A complete listing of the positive birds, mosquito batches, horses and
humans identified so far in Illinois, by county, is available on the
Department's Web site at . Go to the West Nile virus
page and select "2002" under surveillance.
A total of 476 birds, 394 mosquito batches, and 62 horses in 92 Illinois
counties have tested positive this year for the virus since surveillance
for the mosquito-transmitted virus began on 1 May 2002.
The _Culex_ or house mosquito, which can carry West Nile virus or St Louis
encephalitis virus, breeds in warm, stagnant water and begins to increase
in numbers early in the summer. Hot, humid weather conditions in recent
weeks have been ideal for breeding the _Culex_ mosquito and, as a result,
there has been a jump in the number of positive birds, horses, and mosquitoes.
2002 West Nile virus surveillance information can be found on the
Department's Web site at
