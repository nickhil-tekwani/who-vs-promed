MERS-CoV Case Update
-Total number of cases now stands at 165: 118 currently receiving treatment (72 percent), 24 discharged (14 percent), 23 dead (14 percent).
- Of the 118 receiving treatment: 101 in stable condition (86 percent), 17 reportedly unstable (14 percent).
-3 additional cases and 5 additional recoveries compared to previous day's numbers, 4 new fatalities.
-77 have contracted the virus nosocomially, 58 have come in contact in-facility while visiting family, and 30 are of hospital personnel.

Overview of Confirmed Cases
- The Ministry of Health and Welfare's MERS-CoV Task Force has announced 3 new cases of MERS-CoV - bringing the total tally up to 165 - as of 6 AM KST, 18 Jun 2015.
- The number of total patients currently undergoing treatment has decreased by 6 since yesterday and currently stands at 118 (72 percent of total); 5 have recovered, bringing the number up to 24 (15 percent); the fatality count has increased by 4, totaling at 23 (14 percent).

New Cases
- 3 additional cases have been confirmed since yesterday [17 Jun 2015]
- Patient no. 163 (53 year old female, 53) was working as medical faculty at Asan Chungmu Hospital during Patient no.119's hospitalization between 5-9 Jun 2015 [5th generation]

- Following up on Patient no. 162 (33 year old male, 33), a new case reported on 16 Jun 2015:
- The Patient was working as a Radiology Technician at Samsung Medical Center and is believed to have come in contact with the virus sometime between 11-12 Jun 2015, while taking radiology images of Patients no.72, 80, and 135 using a portable x-ray device.

New Dischargees
- Patients no. 40 (24 year old male), 44 (51 year old female), 59 (44 year old male), 62 (32 year old male), and 71 (40 year old female) have been discharged on 16 Jun 2015, bringing the total number of recoveries to 24.
- Dischargees underwent various courses of symptomatic treatments, such as antibiotic and anti-viral treatment. The patients were cleared for discharge after signs of respiratory distress and fever subsided, and confirmatory tests resulted negative.
- Of the 24 total recoveries, 14 (58 percent) are male with 10 (42 percent) being female; 12 have been in their 40s (50 percent), 4 have been in their 50s (17 percent), 2 patients each have been in their 20s and 70s (8 percent each), with 1 patient having been in her 30s (4 percent).

- Of the 23 reported fatalities to date, 16 have been male (70 percent), while 7 have been female (30 percent); in terms of age distribution, the lion's share of the fatalities have been in their 60s with 8 (35 percent) fatalities, followed by 7 (30 percent) fatalities in their 70s, 4 (17 percent) fatalities in their 50s, and 3 (13 percent) in their 80s.
- 21 of the 23 fatalities (91 percent) were elderly, immunocompromised, and/or suffering from pre-existing conditions such as COPD, cancer, cerebrovascular disease, and diabetes.

Modes of Transmission and Demographic Characteristics
- A categorical analysis on the modes of transmission of the 165 total cases reveals:
- Nosocomial infection is the most common mode of transmission at 47 percent (77 cases), infections as a result of hospital visits by family members comprise 35 percent of total cases (58), while infections of faculty and other medical personnel is report to be at 18 percent (30)

- Male infectees comprise 61 percent of the total cases (100), and females, 39 percent (65)
- Total distribution by age of all cases is as follows: 34 patients (21 percent) are in their 50s, 33 are in their 60s (20 percent), 30 (18 percent) are in their 40s, 27 are in their 70s (16 percent), while 24 are in their 30s (15 percent).

Isolations and Quarantine
- As of 18 Jun 2015 6 AM KST, 6729 are under quarantine with the reflected numbers being 3 percent higher than previous day's numbers (an increase of 221); the total number of those released from quarantine has increased to 4492, which equates to an increase of 541 (or 14 percent) compared to previous day's numbers.
- Of the 6729 under quarantine, 5857 are under home isolation (a 1 percent decrease, or a decrease of 53), while the number of hospital quarantines has risen by 274 (46 percent), bringing the total number of hospital quarantines to 872.

Other Notifications
- Confirmatory results on a 7 year-old male suspected to have contracted the virus, conducted by the Gyeonggido Provincial Research Institute of Public Health and Environment, have reported negative on 17 Jun 2015 around 10 PM KST.
- The Research Institute reported the child's case to the Korean Center for Disease Control - whom reported difficulty with specimen collection and handling of the patient - after the initial test resulted positive, but 4 further repeat tests (conducted 13-17 Jun 2015) have all reportedly yielded negative results.

[In the past 24 hours there have been a total of 3 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Two of the 3 cases are healthcare workers. Of the 2 healthcare workers, 1 is a 4th generation case, the other is the 1st 5th generation case reported. The 3rd case, a non-healthcare worker is currently under investigation (and based on observed reports from the Korean MOH, this information will be posted tomorrow in the 19 Jun 2015 update).

The appearance of a 5th generation case in a healthcare worker - presumed physician faculty is disconcerting, with exposure occurring between 5-9 Jun 2015. This individual is the 35 year old police officer who is reportedly in critical condition. It is possible that the healthcare worker was involved in intubating the patient (putting a breathing tube in) a procedure that is high risk of transmission of respiratory viruses.

In the past 24 hours there were 4 additional fatalities reported bringing the total number of fatalities to 23 and increasing the observed/reported case fatality rate to 14 percent. - Mod.MPP]

South Korea reported an additional death from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) on Wednesday [17 Jun 2015], with 8 new cases that brought the total number of people diagnosed with the disease here to 162.

The latest fatality put the death toll at 20, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The ministry said nearly 90 percent of those who died from MERS had existing health conditions, which were apparently worsened by the infection. The latest person to die from the disease also had an existing respiratory problem, as well as high blood pressure, prior to infection, a ministry official said. [According to another media report, she had bronchiectasis, damage to the airways leading to widening with collections of mucus that bacteria can grow in and lead to chronic recurrent lung infections - Mod.MPP]

As of Tuesday [16 Jun 2015], 83 other hospitals have been affected by the disease, mostly by unknowingly treating a MERS patient or a carrier. Currently, 124 MERS patients remained in hospital care, while 18 of them were in unstable condition, according to the ministry.

Some 6500 others were in isolation as of Wednesday [17 Jun 2015] for possible infection after coming in close contact with MERS patients. The number jumped from 5586 on the previous day.

A joint response team of WHO officials and South Korean experts earlier pointed out the country's traditional culture of family members tending to their loved ones in hospitals as a major factor driving the spread of the disease here. Out of 162 people diagnosed with the disease here, 83 percent, or 134, are family members or friends of MERS patients, according to the health ministry.

So far, nearly all infections occurred at hospitals with the only known exception involving an ambulance driver and a rescue worker who helped transport MERS patients.

[The new information in the above media report is the report of the 20th fatality associated with MERS-CoV infection, case No. 42, a 54-year-old female with pre-existing lung disease and high blood pressure. This brings the reported/observed case fatality rate to 12.3 percent. In addition, the number of individuals currently under 2 week quarantine for contact with confirmed cases is now at approximately 6500, up from 5586 yesterday [16 Jun 2015]. In addition, the number of hospitals that have seen MERS-CoV infected individuals is now at 83 (for a full list of them as of 16 Jun 2015, see http://www.wpro.who.int/outbreaks_emergencies/list_of_health_facilities/en/). - Mod.MPP]

WHO statement on the 9th meeting of the IHR Emergency Committee regarding MERS-CoV 17 Jun 2015

The 9th meeting of the Emergency Committee (EC) convened by the Director-General under the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) regarding Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was conducted with members and advisors of the Emergency Committee by teleconference on [16 Jun 2015], from 12:00 to 15:00 Central European Summer Time (UTC +2). WHO convened the meeting in regards to the outbreak in the Republic of Korea.

The WHO Secretariat updated the Committee on epidemiological and scientific developments, including recent cases and transmission patterns in the Republic of Korea and China, related risk assessments, and control and prevention measures. These countries provided updates and assessments on the MERS-CoV situation and developments in their countries.

Members and advisers of the Committee who participated in the recent Republic of Korea-WHO MERS Joint Mission, were invited to share their observations based on their experience.

The Committee noted the assessment of the joint mission regarding main factors contributing to the spread of MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea were:
- lack of awareness among health care workers and the general public about MERS;
- suboptimal infection prevention and control measures in hospitals;
- close and prolonged contact of infected MERS patients in crowded emergency rooms and multibed rooms in hospitals;
- the practice of seeking care at multiple hospitals ("doctor shopping");
- the custom of many visitors or family members staying with infected patients in the hospital rooms facilitating secondary spread of infections among contacts.
- The Committee commended the speed with which the Republic of Korea provided information under the IHR about an infected traveller, enabling China to rapidly locate, isolate and provide care to the individual and place his contacts in quarantine.

The Committee noted that available evidence on genetic sequencing did not identify any significant changes in the viruses obtained from cases in the Republic of Korea compared to viruses from the Middle East. Ongoing monitoring of potential genetic changes in these viruses is important. In this outbreak, transmission of MERS-CoV has been strongly associated with health care settings. This aspect stresses the need for health authorities to make every possible effort to ensure that effective infection prevention and control measures are in place at all times.

There is no current evidence of sustained community transmission. The Committee noted that subsequent public health measures to stop the outbreak, including extensive efforts to enhance contact tracing and steps to ensure that cases and contacts (during the incubation period) are appropriately isolated or quarantined and monitored and that they do not travel, appear to have coincided with a decline in the incidence of cases. However, close monitoring of the situation remains critical to ensure that transmission is interrupted and that all cases without an evident epidemiological link to known chains of transmission be evaluated carefully. For the next several weeks, it is possible for additional cases to be identified, including among contacts who were not identified in the early stages of the outbreak. If reports or rumours of contacts travelling outside of the country are identified, it is important that other countries take notice and quickly assess such possibilities.

The Committee noted that there are still many gaps in knowledge regarding the transmission of this virus between people, including the potential role of environmental contamination, poor ventilation and other factors, and indicated that continued research in these areas was critical.

The Committee expressed its assessment that this outbreak is a wakeup call and that in a highly mobile world, all countries should always be prepared for the unanticipated possibility of outbreaks of this, and other serious infectious diseases. The situation highlights the need to strengthen collaboration between health and other key sectors, such as aviation, and to enhance communication processes.

The Committee reiterated that its previous advice (http://who.int/ihr/ihr_ec_2013/en/) remains relevant and indicated its strong support for the recommendations of the Joint Mission (http://www.wpro.who.int/mediacentre/mers-hlmsg/en/).

The Committee concluded that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [PHEIC] have not been met.

In reaching this conclusion, the Committee noted that after the outbreak was detected, and after a period of organization, the Republic of Korea has strongly initiated actions to bring this outbreak under control. This includes use of multiple approaches to identify contacts and to ensure their appropriate quarantine and monitoring, as well as effective means to stop inappropriate travel of cases and contacts during the period of time when they are potentially infectious. Such efforts reflect adoption of the recommendations of the Joint Mission.

Based on the Committee's advice and information currently available, the Director-General accepted the Committee's assessment. She thanked the Committee for its work.

WHO does not recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions and considers screening at points of entry to be unnecessary at this time. Raising awareness about MERS and its symptoms among those travelling to and from affected areas is good public health practice.

WHO will continue to provide updates to the Committee Members and Advisors. The Emergency Committee will be reconvened should circumstances require.

[The above conclusions are not surprising, given the situation in South Korea and the ability of the country to respond to the crisis. The real question remains of what will happen if a similar "superspreader" event occurs in a country less equipped to respond to an outbreak? Do we know enough about the transmission of the MERS-CoV to be confident that our recommendations will prevent this from happening again?

Ramadan begins this evening (17 Jun 2015) and goes through 17 Jul 2015; it is a period when there is an increase in pilgrims going to Saudi Arabia performing Umrah. The Hajj (the period of the major pilgrimage to Mecca) is expected to fall between 21-26 Sep 2015. For the last 2 years, there have been approximately 2 million pilgrims performing their Hajj, (https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Hajj) and more or less an equal number performing Umrah during the course of a year. While the advice given is that those with co-morbidities should postpone their travel, oftentimes the pilgrims with chronic diseases are the very ones being asked to refrain from visiting yet persist in going as they hope to fulfill their religious obligation before they die, a conundrum to say the least.

Remembering that the index case was sick and undiagnosed (and not isolated) for the 1st 9 days of his illness, during which time he sought medical attention at several different healthcare establishments, I wonder what the ethicists would say about these events, involving a disease we know can be lethal, that we know if not isolated can result in a nosocomial outbreak, that we don't know how to prevent the index case, and that if there is another superspreader returning from the Middle East to a low resource country, a large outbreak could occur. - Mod.MPP]

As of 12 noon today [17 Jun 2015], there have been a total of:
1035 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
458 deaths,
570 recoveries, and
7 currently active cases (including 1 in home isolation).

In the past 24 hours there have been:
1 newly confirmed case,
1 newly reported fatality, and
0 new recoveries.

[The reported case fatality rate is 44.3 percent]

Information on newly confirmed MERS-CoV infection:
- A 28-year-old Saudi male, healthcare worker from Hufoof, currently in stable condition. History of possible contact with other case(s) currently under review.

Information on newly confirmed fatality:
- A 56-year-old Saudi male, non-healthcare worker from Hufoof with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as newly confirmed on 6 Jun 2015, at which time he was noted to be in stable condition]. At the time of initial report a possible history of contact with other case(s) was under review.

[The outbreak in Hufoof continues. There are now 35 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, including 18 deaths for a reported case fatality rate of 51.4 percent. The seeming very high case fatality rate makes one wonder about under-reporting of MERS-CoV in Hufoof and whether there are studies underway to determine the routes of transmission in this ongoing outbreak. Or, to sate the fear mongers, has the virus changed and become more lethal? (My vote is for increased under-reporting due to milder illness presentations). If any of our Saudi subscribers have information on studies ongoing in Hufoof, we'd greatly appreciate it being shared with ProMED.

[5] Overview - media report

http://www.irinnews.org/report/101638/mers-s-best-friend-is-ignorance-so-it-s-time-to-wise-up


The full story of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is yet to be told. Would South Korea now be in the grip of one of the disease's largest ever outbreaks if more had been done sooner to unravel its mysteries?

A key point about MERS was that it gave some warning of its arrival. This was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which struck in early 2003 after an infected Chinese doctor and travellers from Viet Nam, Singapore and Canada mingled in a Kowloon hotel. At the time, no one knew a disease was afoot.

The gravely ill doctor took his virus filled-lungs into Hong Kong's hospital system, touching off a massive wave of infections among health care workers and their families. And after they went home and became sick, the hotel guests seeded infections into their hospital systems.

By contrast, a full 33 months before a South Korean businessman was confirmed to have brought the MERS virus his country, the discovery of a new coronavirus appeared in a report from Saudi Arabia published in ProMED, a disease and outbreak reporting system with broad international reach. ... That has left the world still unable to answer key questions about MERS and how it occasionally infects people. To complicate the situation, over the past year, MERS efforts sputtered, overshadowed by west Africa's catastrophic Ebola outbreak.

"The world's attention has understandably shifted to managing that crisis," said Kamran Khan, an infectious diseases physician who researches the global spread of diseases at the University of Toronto.

"Although MERS has continued to 'simmer' in countries across the Arabian peninsula, it hasn't until now evolved into an international outbreak that has reminded us all that it's still out there and continues to pose a threat," added Khan.

The virus is most prevalent in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. And with millions of pilgrims flocking there annually and with its large contingent of foreign workers, Saudi Arabia seems to pose the biggest risk of exporting MERS to other parts of the world.

The disease and death toll (which stands at 19 as of [16 Jun 2015]), the social and economic disruption, as well as the fear and political strife South Korea is experiencing will likely ratchet up the pressure on the source countries -- and the World Health Organization -- to come up with more answers about MERS as well as strategies for limiting its damage.

Peter Ben Embarek, WHO's point person for the disease, knows what is happening in South Korea could happen elsewhere. "So we should also use it as an argument for doing more in the Middle East."

But infectious diseases expert Michael Osterholm is worried the lesson the world will take from the Korean outbreak will be the wrong one. "What I fear is once we get through Korea, people will say 'See, we can control this. Don't worry.' And they're going to miss the point that we may not be so lucky next time,'" said Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.

To date, 25 countries have reported cases of MERS. Most have had the traveling kind: tourists who contracted the virus on trips to Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates, or infected wealthy Middle Easterners flying out for care via air ambulance.

The vast majority of cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia, which claims roughly 1030 infections, more than 450 of which were fatal. The WHO puts the global MERS count close to 1300, with at least 455 deaths.

While MERS is believed to have originated in bats, camels are now known to play a role in its spread. Multiple studies have confirmed dromedary (single hump) camels can become infected with the MERS virus, though it doesn't make them noticeably ill.

In Saudi Arabia and other parts of the Middle East, the beasts are ubiquitous and beloved. They provide meat and milk, are kept as pets, and are raced. Warnings to be careful around camels (Don't consume their raw camel milk or undercooked meat; Wash your hands after contact) have not always worked. Defiant camel owners have insisted their own animals are disease-free and have, in front of cameras, drunk fresh-from-the-udder milk, or received slobbery camel kisses, to press home their point.

Is that how people become infected with MERS? We don't know. What about the myriad people who contracted MERS but said they had no contacts with camels? The world still does not have the answer, a fact Khan describes as surprising this late in the game.

The way to answer those questions is through conducting a case control study, where epidemiologists quiz people who have and have not been affected by MERS and then compare data on their movements, animal and human exposures, and food and drink consumption. It is frustrating to scientists who study emerging diseases that there still isn't a published case control study on MERS.

That may be about to change. A study, the product of a collaboration with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists, is said to be somewhere in the publication pipeline. Whether it provides the needed answers about how MERS comes to infect people, though, remains unclear.

But why has it taken so long? Was it a lack of local ability to do the work? If so, there were multiple outside researchers offering to help with the study.

Ben Embarek suggests some of the problem is cultural. "They're not used to sharing private things outside of the family environment," he explained. "People tend to be very evasive and not terribly precise in the way they answer. They don't understand what is expected."

A case in point: The WHO MERS team 1st learned some people in Saudi Arabia drink camel urine, believing it has medicinal properties, about a year and a half after they started working on the virus. The WHO team didn't think to ask. And when MERS avoidance advice related to camel contact was originally drafted, their Saudi contacts didn't offer the information.

He and others suggest the answer to the MERS problem has to be a vaccine that blocks the infection in camels, thereby stopping the virus from jumping to people. "There is nothing right now to support that this is going to go away in camels," Osterholm explained.

Without a camel vaccine, South Korea's experience will be repeated. And next time, the virus may turn up somewhere without the system capacity and economic resources to respond effectively.

MERS timeline
2012
- April: A cluster of undiagnosed respiratory illnesses occurs at a hospital at Zarqa, Jordan, claiming 2 lives. (MERS is confirmed in late November.)
- 13 Jun: A man is hospitalized in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia and later dies. Egyptian virologist Ali Mohamed Zaki and experts at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands confirm the infection was caused by a new coronavirus.
- 20 Sep: Zaki reports the new virus to ProMED Mail, an infectious diseases online alert operation. Zaki is later fired. The yet unnamed virus is known as "novel coronavirus" or NCov for short; it is from the same family as the SARS virus.
- 22 Sep: Britain reports to the World Health Organization that a London hospital is treating a Qatari citizen infected with the new virus. The man dies 9 months later.
- 23 Nov: Saudi Arabia reports a cluster of cases in a family.

2013
- February: A UK resident who had traveled home from Pakistan via Mecca, Saudi Arabia, is diagnosed with MERS. In Britain he infects his son, who dies, and another family member. This is the 1st known transmission outside of the Middle East.
- 26 Mar: A man from the United Arab Emirates dies in a German hospital where he sought care for MERS. The man kept racing camels, which raised suspicions the animal may be a source of MERS.
- May: Infections that spread among dialysis patients at a hospital in Al-Ahsa, in northeastern Saudi Arabia triggered a large hospital outbreak.
- 15 May: The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses' Coronavirus Study Group reveals an agreement to rename NCoV. It becomes the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus or MERS-CoV.
- 9 Jul: WHO convenes an emergency committee under the provisions of the International Health Regulations. The advisers say MERS does not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The Emergency Committee has met 7 times since, each time confirming that view.
- 9 Aug: International researchers report finding antibodies to MERS or a MERS-like virus in dromedary (one hump) camels from Oman and the Canary Islands. Multiple studies have since found viruses or antibodies in camels from Arabian Peninsula and African countries.
- 21 Aug: U.S. and Saudi researchers say they found an RNA fragment that is a perfect match for the corresponding part of the MERS virus in droppings from an Egyptian tomb bat.

2014
- 14 Apr: Malaysia confirms MERS infection in a Muslim man who had recently been on pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia. No cases have to date been connected to the Hajj, the major annual pilgrimage to Mecca.
- May: A massive surge in MERS cases in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates is caused by outbreaks in hospitals. The Saudi health minister and deputy health minister are replaced and outside management experts are brought in to help improve the Saudi response.

2015
- 20 May: A South Korean businessman who had travelled to Bahrain, Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia who became sick after he returned home is diagnosed with MERS after visiting 3 medical facilities. He infects more than 2 dozen people, igniting the largest MERS outbreak outside the Middle East.
- 29 May: A man from South Korea tests positive for MERS in China. The man flew to Hong Kong then travelled by bus to Huizhou, in China's Guangdong Province. Alerted by Korean officials, authorities in Huizhou detain and isolate him on 27 May 2015. He appears not to infect anyone in China.
- 9 Jun: A joint WHO-South Korean mission, with experts from Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia and the US Centers for Disease Control and Protection, begin investigating the South Korean outbreak. They conclude though the outbreak is large the virus is not behaving differently.
- 16 Jun: The WHO's MERS Emergency Committee meets for the 9th time. The outbreak has claimed 19 lives.

[6] Incubation period
Date: 18 Jun 2015

As the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) continues unabated with another death confirmed Wednesday [17 Jun 2015], a new worrying development has arisen: The 2-week latency [incubation] period reported in the Middle East appears to be longer in Korea, and people exposed to the disease are showing symptoms more than 2 weeks later. This suggests that Korea's 2-week quarantine system may have been inadequate.

The Ministry of Health and Welfare on Wednesday [17 Jun 2015] announced 8 additional MERS cases, Patients No. 155 to 162, with 6 of them having contracted the disease at Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, as well as another fatality.

Patient No. 42, a 54-year-old woman, who contracted the disease at Pyeongtaek St. Mary's Hospital, where Patient No.1 infected more than 30 people, died on Wednesday [17 Jun 2015], bringing total deaths to 20.

According to the health authority, the patient already suffered from bronchiectasis and high blood pressure. Her death puts the fatality rate at 12.3 percent.

Concerns over the recommended latency period arose in the cases of patients No.158 and 161, who did not exhibit symptoms until after 2 weeks. They were confirmed to have MERS on Tuesday [16 Jun 2015].

"Patient No. 158 visited Samsung Medical Center's emergency room on [27 May 2015] but began to feel ill and experience muscle aches starting [11 Jun 2015]," said Kwon Jun-uk, an official from the Health Ministry.

The emergency room is where patient No.14, who has been referred to as a "super-spreader," infected nearly 80 people so far. He stayed at the hospital from [27-29 May 2015].

The Pyeongtaek city government in Gyeonggi, where the virus 1st spread from patient No. 1, also said Wednesday [17 Jun 2015] that a 79-year-old woman, patient No. 161, tested positive for MERS after she was released from quarantine on Sunday [15 Jun 2015] at Pyeongtaek Good Morning Hospital.

Patient No.161 stayed with Patient No. 17 in the same hospital room at Good Morning Hospital from [27-30 May 27 to 30], and was quarantined for 2 weeks.

In the meantime, the hospital conducted tests on her, with the 1st 3 coming out negative and the 4th inconclusive.

She was released from the hospital after having spent a full 2 weeks in quarantine. She returned to a local hospital for treatment, however, when her 5th and 6th tests -- carried out after she was discharged -- turned out positive. She is currently being treated at the Suwon Hospital of Gyeonggi Medical Center and is reportedly in good condition, exhibiting few symptoms. The woman's friends and family are now under quarantine.

But this is not the 1st case in which a patient has begun to exhibit symptoms following the latency period. Patient No. 146, who also visited Samsung Medical Center on [27 May 2015], began exhibiting symptoms on Saturday [13 Jun 2015], 17 days later, and was confirmed to have MERS on Sunday [14 Jun 2015].

The Health Ministry at the time stated that the case was exceptional, just prior to the 2 additional cases reported Wednesday [17 Jun 2015].

The 5 remaining new patients who contracted the disease from Patient No.14 at Samsung Medical Center began to exhibit symptoms within 2 weeks, though the test results came back late, the official said.

In light of both cases, the government is now considering extending the maximum 2-week latency [incubation] period.

"When it came to the latency [incubation] period, there weren't any questions [or doubts] from experts or patients," Kwon said. "At this point, since most cases are due to tests results that came late, it was considered unreasonable to question the maximum time frame."

"We are still reporting new patients who contracted the disease at Samsung Medical Center [between 27 and 29 May 2015] because some of the test results took time to be confirmed," he added. "On orders from [the health minister], I visited the field yesterday [16 Jun 2015] and determined that there won't be any more delays."

Concerns over the disease's spread have remained constant since the outbreak's start but were renewed Monday [15 Jun 2015] when it was reported that Patient No. 152, a 66-year-old man who tested positive for MERS on Monday [15 Jun 2015], had traveled to his villa in South Chungcheong several times even after exhibiting symptoms.

According to the Gangnam District Office, Patient No. 152 had cared for his wife in Samsung Medical Center's emergency room on [27 May 2015], and then developed a fever on [8 Jun 2015], but nevertheless traveled to his villa outside Seoul.

Patient No. 137 was also found to have used Seoul subway line Nos. 2 and 3 for about 8 days after showing symptoms, increasing the likelihood that the virus could expand to local communities.

Meanwhile, the presidents overseeing various Samsung Group affiliates vowed extensive innovation at Samsung Medical Center, which has come under fire for its poor management of the disease.

Together the top executives have served as a central management element since Chairman Lee Kun-hee stepped down from his position in 2008 to take responsibility for the prosecution's investigation into the conglomerate.

After attending a lecture Wednesday [17 Jun 2015] by Prof. Oh Won-seok of the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, the group, made up of some 50 members, met to discuss the MERS outbreak.

The presidents agreed that the group as well as hospital would provide as much support as possible to settle the outbreak. They also assessed that the hospital lacked a proper crisis response system, which required large-scale innovation.

President Park Geun-hye also emphasized that Samsung Medical Center's role in the quarantine effort was crucial.

On Wednesday [17 Jun 2015], the president visited the National Institute of Health in Cheongju, North Chungcheong, where she met with Samsung Medical Center Director Song Jae-hoon and called for the hospital's full cooperation in combatting the outbreak and its spread.

"Samsung Medical Center's information about the infections must be disclosed transparently," Park said. "It is very important to come up with a list of patients and visitors and where they traveled during the period when they could have been infected."

She also visited the central MERS countermeasure headquarters, established at the government complex in Sejong City, where she was briefed by Health Minister Moon Hyung-pyo and demanded cooperation between the private and public sectors and stronger preventive measures.

[In reading the above article, 2 thoughts come to mind with respect to the incubation period. The 1st, the most direct: that there are exceptions to every rule, and there may well be longer incubation periods in some individuals. The 2nd thought deals with the infection control procedures early on in the outbreak, possibly through the 1st week in June 2015. Was there strict isolation of the individuals under quarantine, or were they able to move about and possibly have another "high risk" exposure to another MERS-CoV case during the actual quarantine period? Clearly, this needs to be addressed to see whether there is the potential need to lengthen the quarantine period, especially given the mobility of the population as evidenced in [7] below. - Mod.MPP]

[7] Possible community exposures - media report

Disquiet over Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) deepened in Seoul Tuesday [16 Jun 2015] after it was revealed that an ill medical aide from Seoul's Samsung Medical Center travelled widely around the city before he was quarantined Friday [12 Jun 2015].

The central government has officially maintained that MERS infections were contained to medical facilities, but the Seoul Metropolitan Government conducted epidemiological studies on the 55-year-old aide and released the result on Tuesday [16 Jun 2015].

Between the time he was infected and finally confirmed as a MERS patient last Friday [12 Jun 2015], he used subways and visited crowded areas like a hair salon and a mall.

"Patient No. 137 used the subway between Seoul National University Station and Ilwon Station, transferring at Seoul National University of Education Station, for at least 7 days [after exhibiting symptoms] including from [5-8 Jun 2015] when his condition worsened," said Kim Chang-bo, the city government's health authority. "We conducted sterilization of the mall and hair salon and isolated those who came in close contact with the patient at home."

The Seoul Metropolitan Government, which is cooperating with the central government for MERS prevention, also said on Tuesday [16 Jun 2015] that it will sterilize the subway stations and give advice to anyone who suspects they have contracted the disease through the Dasan Call Center at 120.

But it will be difficult to track down everyone who traveled on trains with Patient No. 137 even after the city government examines CCTV footage from Seoul Metro. "Faces are not very recognizable on the video footage," Kim said. "Also, it is technically impossible to track down every single passenger because of the number of people using subways during commuting hours."

Patient No. 137 is one of 2944 non-salaried workers of Samsung Medical Center, where Patient No.14 infected 72 people thus far. He is an emergency ward transfer agent whose job is to transfer patients from the emergency ward to a regular hospital room. Many of the people infected in Samsung Medical Center were infected in the emergency ward.

Those non-salaried employees were not initially included in the government's quarantine coverage, and the city government said 73 of them have reported suspected MERS symptoms so far, meaning that there can possibly be more cases like Patient No.137.

Fear of MERS spreading into local communities is not just contained in Seoul. The Ministry of Health and Welfare on Tuesday [16 Jun 2015] announced 4 more confirmed cases of MERS, raising the total to 154. Three of them are 3rd-generation patients, and the quarantine authority admitted they were off the radar until they were confirmed for MERS.

"Patients No. 151, 152 and 154 were not under the government's isolation measures, and only Patient No. 153, [a 4th-generation patient who caught the disease from Patient No.118 on [5 Jun 2015]], was tracked down," said Kwon Jun-uk, an official of the Health Ministry.

One of the 3 3rd-generation patients is Patient No. 154, a 52-year-old civil servant in Daegu. He contracted the disease while he visited his mother at Samsung Medical Center on [27 and 28 May 2015], and subsequently continued to work until he began to feel a chill on Saturday [13 Jun 2015]. He was found to have visited a public bath before he visited a local public health center and was confirmed for MERS on Monday [15 Jun 2015].

The city government of Daegu also quarantined more than 50 of Patient No. 154's coworkers in their homes. His wife and son tested negative and are quarantined at home.

The health authority has not been able to figure out how Patient No. 119, a 35-year-old policeman in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi, was infected. It was previously believed that he was infected by Patient No.52 at a local hospital, but it later turned out that Patient No.52 came to the hospital after the policeman left.

The policeman is believed to have infected others because he was released from the hospital after one of his tests was negative. After being restricted at a state-run hospital from [2 Jun 2015] due to an initial positive test, he was released later when his 2nd test was negative on [3 Jun 2015]. As his condition worsened, he visited a local hospital and then was confirmed for MERS on [10 Jun 2015].

With the disease still spreading, experts say it is the vigilance of the public that is most needed.

"In terms of quarantine, the 1st step is the government's separation of those who had contact with patients; the 2nd step is to manage them, and the last step is the sincerity of people," said Prof. Eom Joong-sik of Hallym University Medical Center in Gangdong District, eastern Seoul.

"We are already in the 3rd stage, where we have to require a heightened consciousness of the public."

Kang Dae-hee, Dean of Seoul National University's College of Medicine, also emphasized the role of people in the preventive efforts.

"Control measures focused on certain bases is now meaningless because there are 4th-generation patients, and thousands of others are being isolated in Seoul," Kang said. "Authorities should disclose all information, and people need to be well aware of it."

Meanwhile, the public is increasingly worrying about the virus threatening the lives of healthy younger people. At the start, only the elderly with preexisting medical conditions were considered likely to succumb to MERS.

The Health Ministry announced 3 more fatalities, Patients No. 38, 98 and 123, on Tuesday [16 Jun 2015], raising the total to 19. The fatality rate as of Tuesday [15 Jun 2015] rose to 12.3 percent.

Patient No. 38, a 49-year-old male, is the country's 1st victim in his or her 40s, though he previously suffered from liver cirrhosis and diabetes.

But 2 of the 19 dead patients seemed to have no underlying diseases.

The ministry said Tuesday [16 Jun 2015] that Patient No. 123, a 65-year-old male, did not have any underlying disease, just like Patient No. 51, a 72-year-old female who died on Friday [12 Jun 2015]. 17 others were previously suffering from other diseases.

The lives of 2 men in their 30s are also at stake. Patient No. 35, a 38-year-old doctor at Samsung Medical Center, and Patient No. 119, a 35-year-old policeman, are known to be in critical condition and on life support equipment called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which is used in case of lung or heart failure.

It was known that the doctor had allergic rhinitis, a minor ailment, and the policeman had no underlying conditions.

One suspected reason for the 2 falling into critical condition is an immune response known as a cytokine storm, an overly activated immune system that destroys normal cells of the body.

[The picture provided of human behavior combined with a possible error of not extending the net wide enough in terms of definition of high risk exposure events may explain why transmission has not been interrupted as yet in South Korea and, more importantly, demonstrate the challenges the Ministry of Health is facing with respect to attempts to interrupt transmission. But some of these stories are very reminiscent of stories that abounded in Ontario during the SARS outbreak there back in 2003. - Mod.MPP]

Korea - Use of blood plasma
http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2015/06/116_180968.html (submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall)
"Two confirmed patients of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) received blood plasma injection treatment but have yet to show signs of recovery, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said Monday [15 May 2015]. The 2 are a police officer ... and a doctor ... ages 35 and 38, respectively. They received the blood plasma from a man who had fully recovered as of [11 Jun 2015]." [Both patients were reported to be in critical condition (see [7] above. - Mod.MPP]

Czech Republic

Tests showed a Czech man hospitalized in Prague with suspected Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) does not have the potentially deadly virus, Health Minister Svatopluk Nemecek said on Wednesday [17 Jun 2015]. [Another suspected case ruled out. - Mod.MPP]

South Korea
http://au.eurosport.com/university-sports/summer-universiade/2012/games-will-go-ahead-despite-mers-outbreak-says-fisu_sto4787261/story.shtml
The International University Sports Federation (FISU) is determined that the 2015 Summer Universiade will go ahead in the city of Gwangju as planned despite the risk of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea ahead of next month's [July 2015] Games. ... Athletes are scheduled to begin arriving in the village on [26 Jun 2015] but may start arriving as soon as [20 Jun 2015] to adapt to venue conditions. Of the 12 200 university athletes from 131 countries who are scheduled to take part in the games, around 400 participants are from 8 countries in the Middle East. This does not include Saudi Arabia, which had already ruled itself out of the Summer University due to the overlap with the Islamic month of [Ramadan]. [At present it seems appropriate to hold the games as scheduled as there is no evidence of community-wide transmission. This is very reminiscent of a similar dilemma posed by the Ebola outbreak and international games that were postponed by a North African country. Are the concerns here importation of the virus or exportation of the virus? - Mod.MPP]
