Risk of adverse outcomes in offspring with RT-PCR confirmed prenatal Zika virus exposure: an individual participant data meta-analysis of 13 cohorts in the Zika Brazilian Cohorts Consortium
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
Knowledge regarding the risks associated with Zika virus (ZIKV) infections in pregnancy has relied on individual studies with relatively small sample sizes and variable risk estimates of adverse outcomes, or on surveillance or routinely collected data. Using data from the Zika Brazilian Cohorts Consortium, this study aims to estimate the risk of adverse outcomes among offspring of women with RT-PCR-confirmed ZIKV infection during pregnancy and to explore heterogeneity between studies.

Methods
We performed an individual participant data meta-analysis of the offspring of 1548 pregnant women from 13 studies, using 1 and 2-stage meta-analyses to estimate the absolute risks.

Findings
Of the 1548 ZIKV-exposed pregnancies, the risk of miscarriage was 0.9%, while the risk of stillbirth was 0.3%. Among the pregnancies with liveborn children, the risk of prematurity was 10.5%, the risk of low birth weight was 7.7, and the risk of small for gestational age (SGA) was 16.2%. For other abnormalities, the absolute risks were: 2.6% for microcephaly at birth or 1st evaluation, 4.0% for microcephaly at any time during follow-up, 7.9% for neuroimaging abnormalities, 18.7% for functional neurological abnormalities, 4.0% for ophthalmic abnormalities, 6.4% for auditory abnormalities, 0.6% for arthrogryposis, and 1.5% for dysphagia. This risk was similar in all sites studied and in different socioeconomic conditions, indicating that there are not likely to be other factors modifying this association.

Interpretation
This study based on prospectively collected data generates the most robust evidence to date on the risks of congenital ZIKV infections over the early life course. Overall, approximately one third of liveborn children with prenatal ZIKV exposure presented with at least one abnormality compatible with congenital infection, while the risk to present with at least 2 abnormalities in combination was less than 1.0%.

[It is helpful to have this available information put together in a single evaluation. The results underscore the seriousness of the Zika outbreak in Brazil and its consequences for the developing fetus and neonate. It would be interesting to see a similar compilation of cases for other countries in the Americas that also had undergone Zika outbreaks. - Mod.TY]

[3] Preschool neurodevelopment

ref: Mulkey SB, Peyton C, Ansusinha E, et al. Preschool neurodevelopment in Zika virus-exposed children without congenital Zika syndrome. Pediatr Res (2022).
---------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Children with in utero Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure without congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) are at risk for abnormal neurodevelopment. Preschool-age outcomes for children with antenatal ZIKV exposure have not yet been established.

Methods
Children with in utero ZIKV exposure and non-exposed controls had neurodevelopmental evaluations at age 3-5 years in Sabanalarga, Colombia. Cases did not have CZS and were previously evaluated prenatally through age 18 months. Controls were born before ZIKV arrival to Colombia. Neurodevelopmental assessments included Pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PEDI-CAT), Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-P), Bracken School Readiness Assessment (BSRA), and Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC). Family demographics and child medical history were recorded.

Results
There were 55 ZIKV-exposed children evaluated at mean age 3.6 years and 70 controls were evaluated at 5.2 years. Family demographics were similar between groups. BRIEF-P t-scores were higher for cases than controls in shift and flexibility domains. Cases had lower PEDI-CAT mobility t-scores compared to controls. There was no difference in MABC between groups. In 11% of cases and 1% of controls, parents reported child mood problems.

Conclusions
Children with in utero ZIKV exposure without CZS may demonstrate emerging differences in executive function, mood, and adaptive mobility that require continued evaluation.

Impact
• Preschool neurodevelopmental outcome in children with in utero Zika virus exposure is not yet known, since the Zika virus epidemic occurred in 2015-2017 and these children are only now entering school age.
• This study finds that Colombian children with in utero Zika virus exposure without congenital Zika syndrome are overall developing well but may have emerging differences in executive function, behavior and mood, and adaptive mobility compared to children without in utero Zika virus exposure.
• Children with in utero Zika virus exposure require continued multi-domain longitudinal neurodevelopmental evaluation through school age.

[One hopes that monitoring of the children in this study will continue in order to get a long-term view of the consequences of in utero Zika virus infection in children without congenital Zika virus syndrome and that other countries, especially Brazil, will conduct similar studies now that these children are in school. - Mod.TY]

[4] Americas: Zika risks

The scientific community is still learning about the Zika virus. In 2022, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported nearly 30 000 cases throughout the Americas and 4 deaths.

Furthermore, PAHO says more than 500 million people are living in areas at risk of Zika, dengue, or chikungunya [virus infections], because of the presence of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito.

As of October 2022, Brazil has the highest cumulative incidence.

By the end of 2016, 48 countries and territories in the Americas had reported 175 063 confirmed Zika patients.

In addition, 22 countries and territories reported 2439 cases of a congenital syndrome (microcephaly, [ocular and other lesions]) associated with Zika [virus infections].

The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently stated because the mosquitoes that spread Zika are found throughout Puerto Rico, people living on the island who have not already been infected are at risk for infection.

Although the Zika virus is now circulating at low levels across the region, the 2016 outbreak had a lasting impact: the babies born with microcephaly during the 2015-2016 outbreak are now turning 6 and 7 years old. Their developmental challenges continue as parents and health authorities grapple with their condition [see the report above in this post].

"It is important not to let our guard down. Surveillance efforts must be maintained to ensure we can respond quickly when the virus is detected," said Dr Marcos Espinal, PAHO's interim assistant director, in a media release. PAHO continues to help countries develop and maintain the ability to detect and confirm cases, treat people and implement effective strategies to reduce the presence of mosquitoes.

"The outbreak was a complicated chess game," said Dr Sylvain Aldighieri, the PAHO incident manager at the time of the Zika epidemic, "with many moving parts, all of which were constantly evolving, making it much more challenging for scientists to study and understand."

As of 4 Dec 2022, there is no USA FDA-approved medicine or vaccine to prevent a Zika [virus] infection. Although there are some promising vaccine candidates in the pipeline, the best prevention is still avoiding mosquito bites, says PAHO.

[It is clear that Zika virus has not disappeared from the Americas. Relatively low-level transmission is occurring and the main vector _Aedes aegypti_ is abundant in the tropical Americas. As the PAHO report above underscores, surveillance efforts must be maintained to ensure quick response when the virus is detected. When new, effective approaches to vector mosquito control is implemented over large geographic areas, the risk of Zika virus infection will be reduced. - Mod.TY]
