"Nodding disease", children, Southern Sudan
-----------------------------------------------
A 10-year-old girl is dying of what may be the world's newest and
oddest disease -- an illness so rare and mysterious that science has
not yet come up with an official name for it. Sitting outside her
family's mud hut, near the small town of Lui, [the girl] is gripped
by a series of brain seizures, which force her neck to arch forwards,
down, and then up again. No wonder people in this isolated corner of
southern Sudan call it "nodding disease."
"We have no clue as what is causing this. It's like a detective novel
and a murder mystery, because it's fatal," says Dr Mickey Richer, a
tropical disease specialist from UNICEF. So far, almost 300 children
are known to have caught the disease, all in one small region of the
country. Bizarrely, the seizures normally occur when the sufferers
start to eat, or when it is particularly cold. When Dr Richer asks
for a bowl of sorghum to be placed in front of [the girl], the
"nodding" begins almost immediately, and stop when she has finished
eating. Curiously, she does not react if she eats unfamiliar food --
a chocolate bar for instance.
Her 8-year-old brother is now in Lui's crowded hospital with the same
disease -- at a more developed stage. He shows signs of being
mentally retarded and physically stunted. During a particularly
fierce seizure he threw himself into a fire, and is now being treated
for severe burns to his leg. 2 other children in the same ward have
almost identical stories.
Epicentre
An hour's drive from Lui along a rutted track lays the village of
Amadi, a silent cluster of huts trapped in a forest of thick green
grass. Amadi is now considered to be the epicentre of the disease --
12 percent of children here are affected. During 2002, experts from
the World Health Organisation did neurological scans on some of the
children, enabling them to confirm that this is a specific and unique
condition.
A 12-year-old stands in the middle of the village, gripped by a
sudden seizure. It looks as though someone is forcing his chin down
onto his chest. "He is nodding 3 times a day," says his father. "The
disease stops him from growing. His brother died from the same
disease, in August [2003]."
Dr Richer gets out her stethoscope and starts examining a dozen
children. A small boy stares dully into the distance. He looks about
11, but his mother confirms that he is 18. So what could be causing
this horrific outbreak? If this had happened in western Europe, it
seems likely there would be at least some answers by now. Here, in
poverty-stricken southern Sudan, families still do not know whether
they should be trying to quarantine their children.
"If one child has nodding, we separate them from the other children,
because maybe it's through air we don't know," says Reverend Sosthen
Amen Lati, whose son is affected.
River theory
Some villagers say the disease is a curse, others blame the country's
long civil war and suspect that government forces have been dropping
chemical weapons on Lui and other rebel-held areas. A toxicology
report commissioned in 2002 by the United Nations comes close to
ruling out chemical warfare, and also plays down the likelihood of
any link to local diets or food production. At the same time it
cautiously raises a few intriguing theories, including the
possibility of infected monkey flesh.
International relief aid is also mentioned. Some locals have admitted
to eating donated seeds, meant for planting not consumption, which
are coated with toxic substances. But Dr Richer's hunch is more
straightforward. She notes that the victims are all concentrated near
the Yei River. She also points out that 93 percent of those surveyed
are infected with a parasitic worm, which causes Onchocerciasis (also
known as river blindness). The level of infection among children
without "nodding" is 63 percent. The worm is carried by black flies,
which breed near fast-flowing rivers like the Yei. Could it turn out
to be the killer in Dr Richer's mystery?

[The picture of the disease suggest a prolonged, slowly progressive
encephalopathy. The possible etiologies are many, but the slowly
progressive nature seems to exclude common infectious agents like
viruses and parasites, including trypanosoma. Infections with
Onchocerca have never been implicated in CNS symptoms, and the high
infection rate probably reflects the endemicity in the area.
Some investigations have already been done and a toxicology report is
mentioned, which should have excluded as far as possible agents of
chemical warfare. However, the symptoms are compatible with many
neurotoxic agents. Agents that cause peripheral neurotoxicity like
Thallium (rodenticides) and arsenic can be excluded, but lead
intoxication may cause encephalopathy without peripheral
neurotoxicity in children. The well documented "Cassava poisoning" of
children in Africa from eating Cassava with a high concentration of
the compound linamarin results in ataxic neuropathy but is
accompanied by a painful peripheral neuropathy not described here.
Other toxic agents in food or local herb medicine could, however, be
responsible.
The report mentions that seeds for planting have been used for
consumption and these are probably treated with fungicides. Edible
oils contaminated (accidentally or deliberately) by mineral oil or
industrial solvents should be looked into. The allusion to an
infection by eating monkey (bush meat) imply either a very slow
acting virus or a prion infection. However, the slow progression
over several years makes this less likely. Discovering the reasons
behind the outbreak of this peculiar disease would be greatly
facilitated by providing autopsy samples from deceased patients and
blood samples for analysis for a variety of compounds as well as time
and place mapping of the cases. A link to the UN report mentioned in
the posting would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.EP]
