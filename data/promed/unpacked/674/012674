Public health officials say children should stay off school for 48 hours
after they have [recoverd] and, as a precaution, the school will be closed
on Mon 27 May 2002. The headmaster at Thorpe Willoughby, Alan Dibb, said:
"They think it is one of these airborne viruses, which, when a child
vomits, is spread readily around the vicinity." Environmental health
officials from Selby District Council have collected samples at the school.
A hundred pupils and 13 staff at the main school have been infected. More
than half the children and some staff at a preschool center close to the
school are also ill, bringing the total number hit by the virus to almost

[The identity of the suspected virus has not been established, but it is
likely that the virus responsible for this outbreak is the Norwalk-like
virus which has been associated with epidemics of "winter vomiting disease"
throughout Europe in recent months, causing the closure of hospitals and
affecting British troops in Afghanistan. This outbreak is significant
because of its extent and the young age of the victims. - Mod.CP]
