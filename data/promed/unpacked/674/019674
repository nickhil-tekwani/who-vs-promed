[Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) is less infectious than highly pathogenic avian influenza. However, the serotypes H5 and H7 of low pathogenic avian influenza can mutate into a highly pathogenic virus. Therefore, strict measures must be taken.

Poultry infected with LPAI viruses may show mild signs of the disease or none at all and may go undetected due to the lack of symptoms in some species of birds. - Mod.CRD
