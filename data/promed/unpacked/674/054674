Crop scientists are asking farmers to help. They know plants were
attacked by a bacterial disease called Goss's leaf blight and wilt.
But University of Minnesota's (MSU) Dean Malvick wants farmers to send
diseased leaves.

Goss's can reduce ear size, or at its worst, kill the plant
completely. The disease has a long history in the US, but it remained
fairly isolated for decades until recently. Malvick wants to know
whether the bacteria affecting Minnesota fields are the same as the
ones wilting corn across the Midwest, or whether they are some sort of
variant.

The disease was 1st confirmed in Minnesota in 2009 in 2 fields. Last
year [2010], there were maybe 40 fields infected. Reports of the
disease have increased "dramatically" this year [2011] in the state.
Malvick said he doesn't have a final tally for 2011, but the area
affected will be much higher than in 2010.

He said researchers don't know why Goss's is increasing so fast. Its
rapid increase over the last few years is something researchers are
concerned about.

[Goss's wilt and blight of maize is caused by the bacterium
_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _nebraskensis_. It is a persistent
and economically serious disease of susceptible maize hybrids in
several states of the USA. In 2009, it was reported for the 1st time
outside the US, from Canada (ProMED-mail post 20100820.2901).

The bacterium can also affect some grasses, which may serve as
pathogen reservoirs. Symptoms include systemic wilting of plants
and/or leaf lesions and blighting. Infection of leaves, stems and
roots occurs primarily through wounds (mechanical, hail, or insect
damage), and plants are susceptible at all growth stages.

The pathogen is seed transmitted and overwinters on crop debris and
maize kernels. Disease management includes cultural practices to
minimise inoculum, crop rotation, and use of resistant crop
varieties.

Other subspecies of _C. michiganensis_ affecting different hosts are
found elsewhere, including _sepedonicus_ (potato ring rot) and
_michiganensis_ (bacterial canker of tomatoes) which can cause severe
yield losses on their respective hosts.
