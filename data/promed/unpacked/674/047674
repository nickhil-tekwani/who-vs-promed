Syria cVDPV2 outbreak situation report no. 26
---------------------------------------------
Key highlights
--------------
- A total of 4 new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week; 3 cases from Mayadeen district and 1 case from Boukamal district, Deir ez-Zor governorate. The most recent case (by date of onset) is [21 Sep 2017] from Boukamal district.
- The total number of confirmed cVDPV2 cases is 74.
- Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partners continue to support the Syrian Ministry of Health with planning for the second phase of the outbreak response.
- A new environmental surveillance laboratory has been successfully established in Damascus this week. WHO has led the training of surveillance officers and staff from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Water Resources

Immunization response
---------------------
- More than 350 000 resident, refugee and internally displaced children have been reached with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) through 2 mass vaccination rounds in Deir ez-Zor and Raqqah governorates since the start of the outbreak.
- In addition, World Health Organization and UNICEF have coordinated with the Government of Syria and local authorities to reach children aged 2-23 months with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in infected and high risk areas of Deir ez-Zor, Raqqah, Aleppo, Idleb, Hama, and Homs governorates and areas of Damascus, Rif Dimashq, and Hasakah.
- Neighboring countries have utilized IPV in targeted vaccination activities, particularly in areas with high concentration of Syrian refugees, to boost immunity.

Risk mitigation strategies
--------------------------
- Planning continues for the 2nd phase of the outbreak response, which will utilize additional doses of mOPV2 and IPV requested by the Syrian Ministry of Health. The request for additional doses of mOPV2 has been approved by WHO's Director General.
- Microplanning continues for the upcoming vaccination activities in Deir ez-Zor, Raqqah, and Hasakah governorates. Microplans are being revised to ensure population movements in parts of Deir ez-Zor are accounted for and newly accessible parts of Raqqah are included.
- A committee comprising Ministry of Health, Ministry of Water Resources, and WHO staff, has been developed for the expansion of environmental surveillance in Syria. A new environmental surveillance laboratory is operational, staff have been trained and the 1st specimen has been collected and will be tested for poliovirus this week.
- Local authorities in Raqqah have agreed to carrying out IPV vaccination in Ein Esa camp, which was missed in earlier IPV vaccination activities.
- Contact sampling from all acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases and sampling of healthy children arriving from known infected areas and silent districts (districts that have not reported AFP cases in 2017) continues to complement AFP surveillance.

Surveillance summary
--------------------
- In 2017, Syria and all governorates but 4 are meeting both key indicators for AFP surveillance: 3 or more non-polio AFP cases per 100 000 children below 15 years of age, and 80 percent or above AFP cases with adequate specimens. Deir ez-Zor (77 percent), Raqqah (76 percent), Rif Dimashq (76 percent), and Swieda (63 percent) are missing the 80 percent target for stool adequacy.
- The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 152 (108 from Mayadeen, 18 from Deir ez-Zor, and 26 from Boukamal districts). Raqqah governorate has reported 24 AFP cases (10 from Raqqah, 12 from Tell Abyad, and 2 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 47 AFP cases (23 from Homs city, 20 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour, and 3 from Talkalakh districts).
- There is one polio-virus type-2 isolate pending genomic sequencing this week.

[The good news is that in the past week there were no new PV2's (poliovirus type 2) identified that are pending genomic studies (as of last week's update, there were 5 PV2's pending genomic studies and 4 of the 5 have been classified as cVDPV2, with one still pending genomic studies).

The other good news is that the most recent date of onset of paralysis is in the end of September 2017, over 2 months ago. One would like to be hopeful and cautiously state that transmission of the cVDPV may well have been interrupted.
