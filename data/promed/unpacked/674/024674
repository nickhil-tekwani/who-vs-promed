A summer camping trip in the Sierra [Nevada] turned tragic for one
California family after a man died from a rare virus. The man died 2 weeks
ago from hantavirus, becoming the 1st Californian in 3 years to die of the
rodentborne virus. Health officials believe the 52 year old was infected
near Bridgeport, about 50 miles north of the Mammoth Lakes resort area [map

2006, after being transported to a hospital in Reno [Nevada].

[The hantavirus that caused this fatality is presumably Sin Nombre virus.
ProMED-mail requests specific identification of the virus, if virus typing
information is available. - Mod.TY]
