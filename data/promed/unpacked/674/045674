Multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Campylobacter_ infections linked to contact with pet store puppies
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC, several states, and the US. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) are investigating a multistate outbreak of multidrug-resistant _Campylobacter_ infections.

_Campylobacter_ bacteria isolated from clinical samples from people sickened in this outbreak were found to be resistant to commonly recommended, first-line antibiotics. This antibiotic resistance means it may be difficult to treat infections with the outbreak strain with the antibiotics usually prescribed for _Campylobacter_ infections.

Since the last update on 3 Oct 2017, 12 more ill people have been reported from 8 states. The most recent illness began on 14 Oct 2017.

As of 23 Oct 2017, a total of 67 people with laboratory-confirmed infections or symptoms consistent with _Campylobacter_ infection have been linked to this outbreak. Illnesses have been reported from 15 states.

State / Case count
Florida / 14
Georgia / 1
Illinois / 4
Kansas / 6
Maryland / 1
Missouri / 5
New Hampshire / 1
New York / 1
Ohio / 24
Oklahoma / 1
Pennsylvania / 2
Tennessee / 2
Utah / 2
Wisconsin / 2
Wyoming / 1
Total / 67

Of 62 ill people with available information, 17 (27 percent) have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Illnesses started on dates ranging from 15 Sep 2016 to 14 Oct 2017.

Epidemiologic and laboratory investigations linked this outbreak to contact with pet store puppies. Of the 67 ill people in this outbreak, 62 (93 percent) have an epidemiological link to puppies at or from a Petland store. 18 patients were Petland employees. 44 people either recently purchased a puppy from Petland, visited a Petland store, or live in or visited a home with a puppy sold by Petland before their illness began. Of the other 5 ill people, 4 reported contact with puppies from other sources and 1 had a laboratory-confirmed infection and did not report any puppy exposure.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) showed that the _Campylobacter_ isolates from ill people and from puppies were closely related genetically. WGS provides additional evidence that the source of human illness in this outbreak is contact with puppies from Petland.

Antimicrobial resistance may be associated with increased risk of hospitalization, development of a bloodstream infection, or treatment failure in patients. WGS has identified multiple antimicrobial resistance genes and mutations in outbreak-associated isolates from 13 ill people and 8 puppies. This finding matches results from standard antimicrobial resistance testing methods used by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory on 10 clinical isolates from 4 ill people and 6 puppies in this outbreak. The 10 isolates tested by standard methods were resistant to azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid, telithromycin, and tetracycline. In addition, 8 of these isolates were resistant to gentamicin, and 2 of these isolates were resistant to florfenicol.

Follow these steps to prevent illness when handling puppies or dogs:
- always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water right after touching puppies or picking up their poop;
- work with your veterinarian to keep your animals healthy and prevent diseases.

[Pet-associated campylobacteriosis is underappreciated in human _Campylobacter_ infection. The following is a recent review of the topic:

Campagnolo ER, Philipp LM, Long JM, and Hanshaw NL: Pet-associated campylobacteriosis: A persisting public health concern. Zoonoses Public Health. 2017 Aug 21. doi: 10.1111/zph.12389. [Epub ahead of print]

Abstract
--------
Campylobacter is regarded as a leading cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis in the USA. We report on a case of laboratory-confirmed _Campylobacter jejuni_ infection in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania among members of a household living with a laboratory-confirmed but non-speciated _Campylobacter_-infected puppy. We describe an outbreak of likely dog-associated campylobacteriosis, the risk factors, potential routes of exposure, and the clinical features in the exposed family members, which began shortly after exposure to the recently purchased dog. We also provide public health recommendations to prevent _Campylobacter_ infections in veterinary care providers, pet owners, and those planning to adopt pets in the future. Finally, this report underscores the importance of the One Health approach when public health responders, human and animal healthcare providers and clinical diagnostic laboratories are tasked with developing effective strategies when investigating, detecting, and responding to zoonoses (diseases shared between animals and humans).
