Suspected anthrax numbers rise to 11 in East Siberia
----------------------------------------------------
Two more people have been hospitalized with suspected anthrax in East
Siberia's Republic of Buryatia, bringing the total number to 11, the
republic's emergencies ministry said on Monday [7 Jul 2008]. 7 people
[had] been officially diagnosed with skin or intestinal anthrax. They
are currently receiving medical treatment for the disease.

Last week, 9 people were hospitalized in the republic's Barguzinsky
Region with the suspected disease after coming into contact with sick cattle.

Medics were been placed on high alert and meat supplies from several
villages, close to the potential source of infection, have been
suspended. A total of 210 people, who may have had contacted with the
infection, are currently being treated with antibiotics.

Anthrax most commonly infects wild mammals and domestic cattle and
sheep, which ingest or inhale the spores while grazing. Humans can be
affected when exposed to blood and other tissues from infected
animals. Anthrax can be highly lethal, but in some forms it responds
well to antibiotic treatment and effective vaccines are available
against the disease.

[This confirms the 8 + 3 suspect cases in the previous report. As
this is a non-contagiouis disease and that 210 people are under
antibiotic (preventive) treatment we can assume that this was the
usual Russian outbreak involving contaminated meat being sold in a
market. As yet there is no information on the species and numbers of
livestock affected.

For Buryatia go to:

and for Barguzin:

This opens up into a long valley heading NE so we can assume it has
an active agricultural base.
