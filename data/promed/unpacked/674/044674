The cause of Paget's disease is still unknown, despite many years of
intensive study. During this time, evidence has sporadically emerged to
suggest that the disease may result from a slow viral infection by one or
more of the Paramyxoviruses. More recently, epidemiologic and molecular
studies have suggested that the canine paramyxovirus, canine distemper
virus, is the virus responsible for the disease. If true, then along with
rabies, this would be a further example of a canine virus causing human
disease. Studies in the natural host have now supported these findings.
Further investigations have proposed that the bony abnormalities seen in
Paget's disease are due to the effects of the virus on osteoclastic
interleukin-6 and c-FOS production, possibly via the transcription factor
NF-kappa B.

[2] Animals Linked to Paget's Disease

Regular daily contact with cattle, dogs, or cats may increase a person's
risk for Paget's disease of the bone, a common disorder of the middle-aged
and elderly with clustering of cases in families and a higher number of
cases in specific geographic locales. Paget's disease of the bone disrupts
the process of bone formation, causing them to weaken, thicken, and become
deformed. Bones usually affected include the pelvis, collarbone, skull,
spine, and long bones of the leg. Overall, the disease strikes about 3% of
the U.S. population over age 40, but the rate increases with age.
For this study, the researchers interviewed 149 people diagnosed with the
disease, asking about their occupational background, exposure to animals,
and consumption of meat. The answers were compared to those given by healthy
persons of about the same age and location -- either in Madrid or the more
rural La Rioja.
Contact with cows (through farming and cattle breeding) was associated with
2.14 times greater risk of Paget's disease. In La Rioja, people who owned
pet dogs for 20 years or more had 40.41 times greater risk of the disorder,
compared with a negligible increase in risk for long-term dog owners in Madrid.
For people who owned cats, among those who did so for less than 20 years the
increase in risk by locale was reversed. Those in Madrid with pet cats were
at 2.51 times greater risk for Paget's disease of bone, compared with only
0.18 times the increased risk among La Rioja cat owners.
Consumption of meat traceable to sick livestock was tied to 2.70 times
greater likelihood of the bone disorder. Frequent consumption during
childhood and youth of brains and other viscera was tied to about a 2 times
greater risk.
[Unfortunately, the Spanish researchers seem to have forgotten that
metropolitan dogs have higher distemper vaccination rates than farm and
rural dogs, just as they have higher rabies vaccination rates and generally
better veterinary care. AHEAD-MOD MHJ]
