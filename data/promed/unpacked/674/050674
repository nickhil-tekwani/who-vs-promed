The Department of Agriculture (DA) said on [Wed 21 Aug 2019] that there is no outbreak of African swine fever [ASF] in the country, after confirming that there have been incidents of hog mortality in some areas. In a press briefing, DA spokesperson Noel Reyes said the DA has yet to identify the real cause of death of the pigs, pending confirmatory laboratory tests. [He explained] that all pigs within the one km [about 0.62 mi] radius from the virus' ground zero were culled.

He also assured the public that there is enough supply of meat in the market and that the meat being sold is safe to eat, [and] advised the public to report any unusual swine mortalities in their communities to the nearest government veterinary offices so that immediate action can be undertaken.

These actions from DA follow reports that some areas in Luzon have recorded suspected cases of ASF, a deadly viral disease affecting hogs alone and that does not pose any health concern to humans.

Agriculture secretary William Dar earlier said he had already ordered the Bureau of Animal Industry to conduct confirmatory (sic) laboratory tests and send blood samples of affected pigs to foreign counterparts to identify the cause of the deaths. He added test results are expected to come in 2 to 3 weeks, but said similar tests could take as long as 3 months.

[We are indebted to Dr Sam Hamilton for forwarding to us the above media report.

In the absence of a notification to the OIE, one is inclined to select the statement of the DA'a spokesperson, excluding ASF, as presenting the official description of a currently factual situation. The results of laboratory investigations in the Philippines and/or from an international reference laboratory, indicating the established identity of the event's actual causative pathogen, would be helpful. - Mod.AS
