Measles resurgence in Italy: preliminary data from Sep 2007 to May 2008
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Following an incidence of 1/100 000 inhabitants in 2006 [1], Italy has been
facing an upsurge of measles cases since September 2007, with outbreaks
being reported in various regions. In Italy, measles vaccination is
currently offered free of charge as combined measles-mumps-rubella (MMR)
vaccine. The current national vaccination schedule recommends 2 doses of
MMR vaccine, given at 11-12 months and 5-6 years of age. Although childhood
vaccination coverage has increased in recent years, reaching the national
average of 88 per cent in 2006 (source: Ministry of Health), with some
regional variability, it is still below the target of 95 per cent set by
the National Measles Elimination Plan (MEP) launched in 2003 [2], and
outbreaks continue to occur.

Measles is a statutorily notifiable disease in Italy and in the last 6 year
period (2001-2006) an average of about 5400 cases were reported annually,
with a range from 215 cases (in 2005) to 18 020 cases (in 2002). According
to the MEP, sensitivity, specificity, and timeliness of case reporting had
to be improved and an enhanced surveillance system was therefore
established in April 2007 [3]. According to the new system, physicians have
to report suspected cases of measles within 12 hours and laboratory
diagnostic testing (never requested previously) of blood, saliva and urine
specimens is recommended for all sporadic cases. Outbreaks of suspected
measles must be investigated with collection of specimens from at least
5-10 cases for confirmation and characterisation of the viral strain. Case
report forms are collected centrally at the Ministry of Health and the
National Health Institute (Istituto Superiore di Sanita; ISS). In order to
support case ascertainment, a National Reference Laboratory was also
established at the ISS.

This report is a preliminary description of the main epidemiological
features of 2079 cases reported to the enhanced measles surveillance system
from September 2007 to May 2008. Cases with negative laboratory results
have been excluded from the present analysis.

Place and time
--------------
Most reported cases occurred in the Piemonte region where a large outbreak
began in September 2007, among a group of unvaccinated adolescents [4].

The 1st case was a 17 year old girl who developed symptoms 2 days after
returning to Italy from the United Kingdom. In the following weeks and
months the outbreak spread in Piemonte and increased measles activity was
also reported in other regions. Since September 2007, clusters of cases and
larger outbreaks have been detected in 15 of the 21 Italian regions, with
the monthly number of nationally reported cases reaching a peak of 434
cases in February 2008. [The number of reported measles cases, by month,
Italy, September 2007-May 2008 (n=2079) is illustrated by a histogram in
the original text]. Over the 9 month period between 1 Sep 2007 and 30 May
2008, the estimated national cumulative incidence of measles was 3.4 cases
per 100 000 inhabitants. Ninety-three per cent of the cases were reported
from 6 regions: Piemonte (966 cases -- 47 per cent of the total), Lombardy
(452 cases -- 22 per cent), Lazio (183 cases -- 9 per cent of total),
Tuscany (128 cases -- 6 per cent), Emilia Romagna (113 cases -- 5 per cent)
and Veneto (87 cases -- 4 per cent). The remaining cases were reported in
Sardinia, P.A. Trento, Liguria, Valle DAosta, Marche, Abruzzo,
Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Puglia [5].

The reported measles incidence per 100 000 inhabitants, by region, from
September 2007 to May 2008 is presented as a figure in the original text.
The highest incidence was reported from Piemonte followed by Lombardy,
Tuscany and Lazio with 22.2, 4.7, 3.5, and 3.3/100 000 inhabitants,
respectively.

Transmission occurred in families, schools, hospitals, Roma/Sinti
communities, and groups opposed to vaccination. In several regions cases
also occurred among health care workers.

Age and vaccination status of cases
-----------------------------------
The age was reported for 2008 cases (97 per cent). The median age of cases
was 17 years (range: 0 to 77 years). Almost 60 per cent of cases (1247)
were aged 15 to 44 years. More specifically, 23 per cent of cases were aged
15 to 19 years, 15 per cent were aged 20 to 24 years, and 21 per cent were
aged 25 to 44 years. Using national age-specific population figures as
denominators, adolescents aged 15 to19 years had the highest incidence,
followed by infants (over 1 year of age): 15.8/100 000 and 11.3/100 000,
respectively.

Of the 1932 cases for whom vaccination status was known, 1772 (91.7 per
cent) were unvaccinated against measles at the time of infection, 130 (6.7
per cent) had received only one dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV),
12 (0.6 per cent) had received 2 doses, while 18 (1 per cent) were
vaccinated but the number of doses was unknown.

Microbiological investigation
-----------------------------
Overall, 631 cases (30 per cent) have been laboratory-confirmed.
Preliminary molecular sequence analyses have identified genotype D4 in all
positive samples tested up to early May 2008, with the exception of one
sample from Emilia Romagna (genotype D8, 99 percent similar to viruses
identified in 2007 in UK and in 2008 in Canada). [A recent account of the
genotypic diversity of measles viruses in Europe is available in Kremer et
al. Emerg Infect Dis 2008; 14(1)
<http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/14/1/107.htm>. - Mod.CP]

Hospitalisations and complications
----------------------------------
Information on hospitalisations and complications was available for 1227
cases. Of these, 371 (30 per cent) were hospitalised. One case of
encephalitis was reported as well as 3 cases of thrombocytopenia, 22 cases
of pneumonia, and 27 of otitis media.

One death due to measles pneumonia occurred in a laboratory-confirmed case
in the Piemonte region, in an unvaccinated 10 year old child with a genetic
immunodeficiency syndrome.

Public health measures
----------------------
In each region, outbreak investigation and control measures were initiated
by the local health authorities, according to the procedures indicated in
the MEP and in the enhanced surveillance circular [2,3]. The type and
extent of the public health response measures varied amongst local
authorities but generally included basic epidemiologic investigation of
suspected cases, identification and vaccination of susceptible contacts and
laboratory confirmation of diagnosis. Primary care paediatricians and
general practitioners were alerted for prompt reporting of measles cases
and further investigation.

Discussion
----------
Although some progress has been made in Italy since the implementation of
the MEP, as shown by the increase in routine immunisation coverage (from 84
per cent in 2003 to 88 per cent in 2006 in 2 year old children, source:
Ministry of Health) and the introduction of a routine 2nd dose, the ongoing
outbreaks indicate that much still needs to be done.

Molecular characterisation studies indicate that the 1st case reported in
the Piemonte region was imported from the United Kingdom (genotype D4) [6]
showing the importance of international efforts in controlling the current
upsurge of the disease in Europe [7-9].

In Italy, adolescents and young adults have been particularly affected and
most reported cases were unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated.
Nosocomial transmission occurred in several regions and cases were also
reported among healthcare workers. As in 2006, cases have once again been
reported among the Roma/Sinti population [10].

In conclusion, there is an urgent need to improve vaccination coverage with
2 doses of MMR in Italy, not only among children, but also among
adolescents and young adults. More efforts should also be made to prevent
measles transmission in health care settings by implementing effective
infection control practices and ensuring that all healthcare workers are
immune to measles, and to raise immunisation coverage in hard-to-reach
populations. Surveillance and laboratory confirmation have improved but
outbreak control should be further strengthened as viral transmission was
not effectively interrupted. Finally, vaccination coverage in adolescents
and young adults and 2nd dose coverage in children should also be closely
monitored. A national vaccination coverage survey is currently being
conducted and will provide updated information on coverage in children and
adolescents as well as on reasons for non-vaccination.

[The outbreak in 2007 which marked the resurgence of measles in Italy
appears to have been initiated by a 17 year old girl who developed symptoms
2 days after returning to Italy from the United Kingdom. In the following
weeks and months the outbreak spread throughout Piemonte and increased
measles activity was observed in other regions. Despite an increasing level
of vaccine coverage in Italy, there are still sufficient numbers of
unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people in the population to allow and
sustain the spread of measles virus throughout the whole community.
