PENGUINS - SOUTH AFRICA (4)
===========================
A potential explanation of a toxin suggested by Mark Pokras DVM could be
the presence of domoic acid in the penguin's food source. I recall an old
example of Antarctic gentoo penguins whose sterile guts were due to the
polyphenol-containing phytoplankton that were grazed by euphausid shrimps
that the birds ate. The abstract below provides a reference for seabird
deaths due to domoic acid poisoning. Dr. Garrison is currently chief
scientist on a cruise in the Antarctic, but I have forwarded the discussion
to him for comment.

Journal Title: NATURAL TOXINS.
Abstract: During the autumn of 1991, numerous seabird fatalities in
Monterey Bay, California, led to the discovery of a new domoic
acid-producing diatom, Pseudonitzschia australis. Since this
initial event, sizable populations of P. australis, as well as
other likely toxin producers, P. pungens f. multiseries and P.
pseudodelicatissima, have occurred biannually in Monterey Bay.
