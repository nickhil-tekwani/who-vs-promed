[If all the veterinary vaccinations scheduled for the Bolpur area have been
done, livestock cases should have ceased by now. This is a new set of 3
villages however, and public health advice on not butchering and consuming
dead livestock in this clearly widespread outbreak of anthrax needs
reinforcing. - Mod.MHJ]
