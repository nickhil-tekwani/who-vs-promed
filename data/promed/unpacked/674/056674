An acute watery diarrhea (AWD) disease outbreak in Ethiopia's 2nd largest city Dire Dawa, 446 km [277 mi] east of Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, has infected 127 people in September 2017, an Ethiopian official said on Mon 9 Oct 2017. Speaking to journalists, Muluken Argaw, Dire Dawa city Health Bureau chief, said the infected people are being treated in the city's main hospital and several have already been discharged after finishing their treatment. Araw cited lack of proper waste disposal means, unsanitary toilet uses and failure to properly cook vegetable foods as reasons behind the diarrhea outbreak.

Several major cities in Ethiopia including Addis Ababa, Mekelle, and Bahir Dar have recorded AWD outbreaks that infected thousands earlier in 2017, exacerbated by unsanitary health practices and Ethiopia's rainy season which stretches from Late June until mid-September.

Ethiopia Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH), regional, and cities health bureaus have also been combating the diarrhea outbreak by treating unhygienic conditions in factories and agricultural areas. FMoH is also currently engaged in educational programs on the cause of AWD
and ways to prevent and treat it.

[AWD is usually used as a euphemism for cholera especially in reports from Sudan and Ethiopia. Dire Dawa is one of 2 chartered cities (astedader akabibi) in Ethiopia (the other being the capital, Addis Ababa). It is divided administratively into 2 woredas (districts), the city proper and the non-urban woreda of Gurgura and can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dire_Dawa. - Mod.LL

Lusaka has been hit by a cholera outbreak with merely the 1st signs of rain. The number of cholera cases have reached 17 with 2 more cases reported in Lusaka's Kanyama Township. Cholera in Zambia is an annual problem although the public may be concerned that with barely the rain season commencing the capital city has already fallen.

The patients are admitted at the Kanyama Cholera Centre with the disease having broken out on 4 Oct 2017. The affected are Chipata, Mazyopa, Kabanana, and Kanyama Townships.

[3] Cholera - Burundi (Cibitoke province)
Date: Sat 7 Oct 2017 11:52:12 CAT
Source: Global Times, Xinhua News Agency report [edited]
http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1069163.shtml


At least 5 cases of cholera were reported this week [week of 2 Oct 2017] in Rugombo town in Cibitoke province, 72 km [about 45 mi] northwest of the Burundian capital Bujumbura, the Burundi News Agency reported Fri 6 Oct 2017. All those 5 cholera cases were reported at Rusiga, adding that lack of clean water is the origin of the propagation of cholera in that area, the state-run agency reported.

The Burundi Red Cross has deployed its agents to distribute drugs in infected households at Rusiga to avoid the propagation of the epidemic, it reported. Cibitoke Governor Joseph Iteriteka on [Fri 6 Oct 2017] held a meeting with health and administration officials based in Cibitoke province to look at ways of curbing the propagation of cholera in Rugombo and Cibitoke town, according to the report. During the meeting, they urged the country's Water and Electricity Company (REGIDESO) to supply water to the 2 towns -- Rugombo and Cibitoke -- as they are the worst threatened, reported the agency.

The Burundian Imbo western lowlands extending from the north in Cibitoke province to the south in Makamba Province near Lake Tanganyika are vulnerable to cholera every year in the dry season, especially between August and October. By the end of August 2017, the east African country's health ministry confirmed 24 cholera cases in Nyanza-Lac in the southwestern province of Makamba, which originated from a fisherman who had come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo with symptoms of cholera.

[4] Cholera - Congo DR (Haut Lomami, Kasai Oriental provinces)

More than 2000 cases of cholera, including 70 deaths, were recorded in the province of Upper Lomami in early October 2017. These figures were provided at the end of the evaluation meeting chaired last weekend [30 Sep-1 Oct 2017] by the governor of the province. Health authorities have revealed that of the 16 health zones in the province, 7 are affected by the cholera epidemic. These authorities denounce the lack of inputs that do not favor the management of cholera cases in Kamina. Most cholera treatment centers do not have enough dehydration fluids and chlorine. Health officials do not have enough resources to move to sites or centers affected by the epidemic.

In Kasai-Oriental, the health zone of Kabeya Kamuanga is on maximum alert against cholera. Since Thu 28 Sep 2017, the populations of the city of Keena Nkuna and all the 15 areas of this health zone are called to strict observance of the practices of prevention of the epidemic.

An artisanal diamond digger began to have diarrhea and died 8 hours later. The health zone speaks of it as a suspect case, which could also be negative. Since the death occurred at home, no analysis could be made to confirm or disprove the case. Nevertheless, measures were taken to disinfect the body, the residence of the deceased, and all the people who had transported it with bare hands, from the diamond mine to the city.

72 hours later, no other suspect cases have been reported, says Dr Moise Kalonji, chief medical officer of Kabeya Kamuanga health zone. Meanwhile, awareness-raising continues in the city of Keena Nkuna, capital of the territory, in all health areas, and along the rivers.

[5] Cholera - Nigeria
Date: Tue 10 Oct 2017

The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control says no fewer than 184 persons died from an outbreak of cholera in 8 states across the country in 2017. The Surveillance Focal Person of NCDC, Nanpring Williams, said this at the Water Sanitation and Hygiene Sector Meeting, organised by the Federal Ministry of Water Resources in Abuja on Tue 10 Oct 2017.

She said that the affected states were Zamfara, Kwara, Borno, Lagos, Oyo, Kebbi, Kaduna, and Kano. Williams said that the National Cholera Situation Report indicated that there were 8241 suspected cases of the disease in parts of the country and added that the centre was executing the pilot phase of administering oral cholera vaccine in Muna Internally Displaced Persons Camp and the entire Mafa local government area in Borno, reaching no fewer than 34 815 persons. The centre was also conducting active surveillance and laboratory diagnosis, effective coordination and case-by-case management of cholera.

Williams said there were cases of water contamination in Kebbi through open defecation, adding that deliberate efforts were needed from all stakeholders to promote access to water and sanitation. She, however, bemoaned the lack of coordination between the state ministries of health and the rural water supply and sanitation agencies, saying that the deficiency had been a major challenge to efforts to strengthen WASH [water, sanitation, and hygiene] activities in the country.

More than 1550 people have died from a raging cholera outbreak afflicting the Eastern and Southern Africa Regions since the beginning of 2017. The deaths have been recorded from 102 800 outbreaks in Angola, Burundi, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Somalia accounts for 76.6 percent of the total cases reported, followed by South Sudan at 15.9 percent. Over the past 4 weeks, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef), Tanzania has reported the highest number of new cases with 125. Cumulatively, the conflict-torn South Sudan has recorded the highest case fatality ration. Heavy rains have been cited as the main culprit of the outbreak but poor sanitation is commonplace in the affected regions. Conflict and subsequent displacements in such countries as Burundi, Somalia, and South Sudan have exacerbated the outbreak of the water borne disease in the respective countries.

[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
