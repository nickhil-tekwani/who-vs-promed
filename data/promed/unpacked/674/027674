[3] Mexico, Cuba: deaths

Mexico and Cuba have reported the deaths of 2 people who had tested positive to monkeypox, although neither country attributed the fatalities to the viral disease.

The reports follow monkeypox-related deaths reported in Brazil and Ecuador in the past month, but fatalities remain extremely rare in the current outbreak.

Mexico's health ministry on Tuesday [23 Aug 2022] said experts were investigating the death of an HIV-positive patient who had died from septic shock and pneumonia after testing positive for monkeypox.

Cuban authorities said a 50-year-old Italian man died on Sunday [21 Aug 2022] after being diagnosed with monkeypox on Saturday [20 Aug 2022]. The public health ministry said the tourist, who had arrived on 15 Aug [2022] had been in an unstable condition since Thursday [18 Aug 2022] and rapidly deteriorated. The ministry pointed to an autopsy report that reported the cause of death as sepsis linked to pneumonia and organ damage.

The World Health Organisation has warned that people with underlying immune deficiencies could be at risk of more serious symptoms and death after contracting monkeypox.

[There is no mention if the case in Mexico was under treatment for HIV and that this infection is under control nor if the Cuban patient was HIV positive. It is difficult to know what HIV's contribution to death might have been. The question then is, did these patients die from monkeypox virus infection or with it, as Corr.SB suggests. - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Highlights
----------
- Monkeypox virus and SARS-CoV-2 infections can occur simultaneously.
- Flu-like symptoms and SARS-CoV-2 positivity should not exclude monkeypox in high-risk individuals.
- Monkeypox is often diagnosed in subjects with a previous or concomitant sexually transmitted infection.
- The oropharyngeal swab for monkeypox virus may still be positive for several days after clinical remission.
- Since there is no widely available treatment or prophylaxis, rapid diagnosis is key to containment.

Dear Editor
In this journal E. Orviz and colleagues recently described the clinical presentation of the 1st monkeypox patients in Spain, highlighting the frequent co-presence of sexually transmitted infections (STI). To date, no reports of co-infection with monkeypox virus and SARS-CoV-2 have been published. Therefore, in this study we present the clinical features and diagnostic procedure of the 1st documented case of co-infection with monkeypox virus, SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1.

Since January 2022, more than 16 000 people in over 74 countries have been affected by monkeypox, prompting the World Health Organization to declare this outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Human-to-human transmission occurs through close contact with infectious material from skin lesions, fomites, seminal fluids, and oropharyngeal secretion. The majority of cases were registered in gay or bisexual men often suffering from other STI. At the same time, SARS-CoV-2 is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. COVID-19 shares with monkeypox both the transmission by air droplets and the symptoms of fever, lymphadenopathy, headache, sore throat, and fatigue. As these pathogens continue to spread, individuals can be simultaneously infected with monkeypox virus, SARS-CoV-2, and STI, making it difficult for physicians to perform the correct diagnosis, also considering that not all patients with monkeypox develop skin lesions and that COVID-19 may rarely present with rash and vesicles.

Our patient, an Italian 36-year-old male spent 5 days in Spain from 16 to 20 Jun 2022 (Figure 1 -- available at the source URL above). Then 9 days after, he developed fever (up to 39 deg C/102 deg F), accompanied by sore throat, fatigue, headache and right inguinal lymphadenomegaly. On 2 Jul 2022 he resulted positive for SARS-CoV-2. On the afternoon of the same day a rash started to develop on his left arm. The following day small, painful vesicles surrounded by an erythematous halo appeared on the torso, lower limbs, face and glutes. On 5 Jul 2022, due to a progressive and uninterrupted spread of vesicles that began to evolve into umbilicated pustules, he went to the emergency department of the Policlinico "G. Rodolico - San Marco" University Hospital in Catania, Italy, and was subsequently transferred to the Infectious Diseases unit.

This case highlights how monkeypox and COVID-19 symptoms may overlap, and corroborates how in case of co-infection, anamnestic collection and sexual habits are crucial to perform the correct diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants are currently responsible for more than 1 million COVID-19 cases per day worldwide. Hence, clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 and monkeypox virus co-infection, particularly in subjects with a recent history of travel to monkeypox-outbreak areas. If monkeypox is suspected, an oropharyngeal swab should be performed even in the absence of cutaneous manifestations as the skin may be spared, but the oral or rectal mucosa may be involved.

Our case emphasises that sexual intercourse could be the predominant way of transmission. Therefore, complete STI screening is recommended after a diagnosis of monkeypox. In fact, our patient tested positive for HIV-1 and, given his preserved CD4 count, we could assume that the infection was relatively recent. To note, the monkeypox oropharyngeal swab was still positive after 20 days, suggesting that these individuals may still be contagious for several days after clinical remission. Consequently, physicians should encourage appropriate precautions. As this is the only reported case of monkeypox virus, SARS-CoV-2, and HIV co-infection, there is still not enough evidence supporting that this combination may aggravate patient's condition. Given the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the daily increase of monkeypox cases, healthcare systems must be aware of this eventuality, promoting appropriate diagnostic tests in high-risk subjects, which are essential to containment as there is no widely available treatment or prophylaxis.

[5] Safety alert: fecal microbiota transplant
Date: Mon 22 Aug 2022
Source: US Food and Drug Administration [edited]
https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/safety-availability-biologics/safety-alert-regarding-use-fecal-microbiota-transplantation-and-additional-safety-protections-0


Since May 2022, an outbreak of monkeypox disease has been ongoing in multiple countries, including the United States. In the United States, monkeypox is thought to be spreading primarily through close contact with an infected, symptomatic individual. Whether, and the extent to which, monkeypox virus can be transmitted through feces or from asymptomatic infected individuals is not known.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is informing healthcare providers and patients of the potential risk of transmission of monkeypox virus through fecal microbiota for transplantation (FMT) products and that FDA has determined that additional safety protections are needed.

Summary of the issue
--------------------
Recent studies have documented the presence of monkeypox virus DNA in rectal swabs and/or stool samples from infected individuals. One study reports detection of monkeypox virus DNA in rectal swabs from 3 individuals who reported no symptoms of monkeypox disease, including 2 individuals who had viable monkeypox virus isolated from rectal swabs. This information suggests that monkeypox virus may be transmitted through FMT products, although the risk of such transmission is unknown.

Although there is an available test for detection of monkeypox virus DNA from swab samples taken directly from a lesion, at this time, there is limited information on the availability and sensitivity of direct testing of stool for monkeypox virus.

Additional protections for the use of FMT
-----------------------------------------
FDA is advising that clinical use of FMT has the potential to transmit monkeypox virus. Due to the potential for serious adverse events to occur, FDA has determined that additional protections are needed for any investigational use of FMT, whether used as part of a study under an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) on file with the FDA or otherwise, if it involves stool donated on or after 15 Mar 2022. These additional protections are as follows:
- Donor screening with questions directed at identifying donors who are at high risk for monkeypox, may be currently infected with monkeypox virus, or may have been recently infected with monkeypox virus. Donor screening includes retrospective screening for the use of FMT prepared from stool donated between 15 Mar 2022 and the date of prospective implementation of updated donor screening for monkeypox;
- Development of criteria for exclusion of donors and donor stool based on donor screening; and
- Informed consent that includes information about the potential for transmission of monkeypox virus via FMT, including FMT prepared from stool from donors who are asymptomatic for monkeypox.

Actions
-------
FDA is notifying Investigational New Drug Application (IND) holders of the potential risk of transmission of monkeypox virus via FMT and of FDA's determination that they need to develop and implement additional safety protections.

FDA is communicating this information with this statement to all other stakeholders to ensure that everyone is fully informed.

FDA will provide further information, as warranted, including on any additional protections pertaining to monkeypox that may be needed for use of FMT.

Information for healthcare providers and patients about enforcement discretion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In July 2013, FDA issued a guidance document explaining that the Agency intends to exercise enforcement discretion under limited circumstances regarding the IND requirements for the use of FMT products to treat _C. difficile_ infection in patients who have not responded to standard therapies. The guidance states that FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion provided that the treating physician obtains adequate consent for the use of FMT from the patient or his or her legally authorized representative. The consent should include, at a minimum, a statement that the use of FMT to treat _C. difficile_ is investigational and a discussion of its potential risks.

Reporting adverse events
------------------------
FDA encourages all healthcare providers and patients to report any suspected adverse events or side effects related to the administration of FMT products to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or http://www.fda.gov/medwatch.
