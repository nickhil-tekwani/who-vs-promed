Bolivia's public health authorities declared the province [department] of La Paz on epidemiological alert owing to an outbreak of bubonic plague detected in communities along the border with Peru, the government said Tuesday, 1 Jul 2014.

The provincial head of epidemiology, Rene Barrientos, told the media that a boy of 14 has died of the illness and another 3 suspected cases have been found in the municipality of Apolo, in the northern part of the region. The alert was declared to take action in the area and "avoid there being more victims and to keep the illness from leading to pneumonic plague," which, unlike bubonic plague, can be transmitted from person to person, Barrientos said.

[_Yersinia pestis_ is endemic in parts of South America including the La Paz department of Bolivia.

Most cases are due to bubonic plague following the bite of an infected rodent flea causing a swollen and very tender lymph gland. The swollen gland is called a "bubo." Bubonic plague should be suspected when a person develops a swollen gland, fever, chills, headache, and extreme exhaustion, and has a history of possible exposure to infected rodents, rabbits, or fleas. A person usually becomes ill with bubonic plague 2 to 6 days after being bitten.

When bubonic plague is left untreated, plague bacteria invade the bloodstream. As the plague bacteria multiply in the bloodstream, they spread rapidly throughout the body and cause a severe and often fatal condition. Infection of the lungs with the plague bacterium causes the pneumonic form of plague, a severe respiratory illness. The infected person may experience high fever, chills, cough, and breathing difficulty and may expel bloody sputum. If plague patients are not given specific antibiotic therapy, the disease can progress rapidly to death. At this stage, as appears to have happened in this posting, person-to-person spread can occur, causing other cases of "primary" plague pneumonia. - Mod.LL
