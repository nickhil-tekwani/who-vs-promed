LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY (9)
======================================
The urine antigen test for legionellosis was mentioned in some
earlier postings.
As far as I know, the urine antigen test is an RIA-based one. Do any
subscribers know of a more convenient and commercially available
antigen test?
