Importing countries demand double PCR test before import of cattle
---------------------------------------------------------
Regarding the question raised in the previous post by ProMED [Schmallenberg virus - Europe (09): international impact, RFI 20130127.1517331, "I was in a Middle Eastern country from 7-18 Jan 2013, that routinely imports dairy cattle from Europe. Does anyone know whether these cattle are being tested prior to export?"]:

Most importing countries demand a PCR test. If the results are negative a "Schmallenberg clearance" will be issued and attached to the Health Certificate.

Every importing countries seems to have its own regulations, see for instance an example (Egypt, derived from the website of the Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (nVWA): [in Dutch and English; the Dutch text deleted]:

Quote:
Annex 2: Schmallenberg virus statement
1) Annex to the veterinary health certificate with nr:
Exportation of female breeding cattle from the Kingdom of The Netherlands to the Arab Republic of Egypt
I the undersigned, official veterinarian, certify that the animals listed in the abovementioned certificate:
1. Originate from herds and farms from which no case of the Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has been officially notified;
2. Were tested with negative results on SBV using 2 PCR tests within the quarantine;
3. Are subject to measures, during their entire stay at the collection centre/quarantine station, aimed to protect them against insect vectors, which can transmit the SBV;

Notes
-----
1) This attachment is part of the veterinary health certificate and must be attached to it in an indivisible manner;
2) The colour of the official seal and the signature must be different from the colour of printing of the certificate;
