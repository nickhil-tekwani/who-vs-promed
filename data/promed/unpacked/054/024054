Five people have now been sickened in the legionnaires' disease outbreak linked to the water distribution system at VA [Veterans Administration] Pittsburgh Healthcare System's University Drive Campus in Oakland, a hospital official reported on Thursday [22 Nov 2012].

VA spokesman Dave Cowgill declined to say if the most recent victim has been successfully treated or remains hospitalized, citing federal privacy laws. Officials said last week [week of 12 Nov 2012] that 4 patients who developed pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ bacteria were successfully treated and released.

"Patient privacy concerns prohibit me from responding in this particular case," Cowgill wrote in an email. The 5th patient likely contracted the illness before officials completed cleaning the water distribution system with hyperchlorinization and flushing, Cowgill said. The incubation period for the bacteria is 14 days, and therefore, officials determined the patient became infected in the hospital, he said.

The 146-bed facility remains under alert for more cases, and officials have imposed water restrictions after discovering the outbreak on 16 Nov 2012. Cowgill could not say when the restrictions will be lifted. Restrictions include using water buffaloes [mobile water storage tanks] for cooking and cleaning, and using hand sanitizers instead of soap and water for handwashing. Patients, visitors, and employees have been instructed not to drink the water. Officials have brought in bottled water and bagged water for patients' baths.

The [infection caused by these] potentially deadly bacteria typically is treated with antibiotics. Some people with weakened immune systems can be more severely affected. The VA has not released specific patient information.

Officials said they have changed the way they disinfect the hospital's water distribution system.

The VA [Veterans Administration] Pittsburgh Healthcare System on Thursday [22 Nov 2012] confirmed another case of legionnaires' disease, making it the 5th case tied to an outbreak of the pneumonia-like infection that was spread through the water system at its University Drive Hospital in Oakland.

Legionnaires' cases are not unheard of in Western Pennsylvania. But the location of this outbreak has grabbed the attention of the medical community because it is the same hospital that used to be home to Victor Yu and Janet Stout, researchers who made many landmark findings about the disease -- including the 1982 discovery that tied the spread of the disease to water systems.

"It is surprising," said Norman Moore, director of scientific affairs for Maine health products manufacturer Alere Inc. and a legionnaires' [disease] researcher for 17 years. "They're the ones who put together how to find legionnaires' with testing and other discoveries." Dr Stout and Dr Yu also contend that the outbreak could have been avoided if the VA had better monitored its copper-silver ionization system, a water disinfection method first installed at the University Drive hospital in 1993 specifically to prevent legionnaires' disease. "The system wasn't performing optimally because it wasn't being managed properly," said Dr Stout, a legionnaires' [disease] expert who used to work in the VA's laboratory and was ousted with her colleague, Dr Yu, in a dispute with VA's management in 2006. "I don't take it lightly that veterans at the VA have been harmed needlessly. It's very preventable." Pittsburgh VA spokesman David Cowgill refused to answer any questions about the allegations by Dr Stout and Dr Yu.

It was Dr Stout and Dr Yu, who now run a private laboratory and consulting business, who originally chose to install the copper-silver system in the hospital in 1993. The VA also has, without Dr Yu and Dr Stout's input, added 2 other copper-silver systems in hospital expansions in 2009 and 2011. Dr Stout and Dr Yu say they were told that VA officials were aware they had problems with the copper-silver system as early as June [2012] -- 4 months before they knew they had an outbreak -- when they called in an outside consultant, Pittsburgh-based Enrich Products Inc., to look at the system. Enrich recommended in July [2012] that the VA make immediate adjustments to the copper-silver levels -- which were haphazard in prior test results, showing up both much higher and lower than recommended levels, an inside source said. But the consultant wasn't called back to make the adjustments until October [2012], the source said, at about the time the VA first realized it might have an outbreak.

In late October VA Pittsburgh called the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help analyze the problem, according to CDC officials. Enrich operations manager Aaron Marshall said he could not comment about any consulting work his company has done. Mr Cowgill of the VA would not provide any specifics about why the VA believes the copper-silver ionization system failed or why it called Enrich this past summer [2012]. On 16 Nov 2012, when Pittsburgh VA confirmed that it had a legionnaires' outbreak, it said in a news release that its copper-silver ionization system "may not be as effective as previously thought," and it was switching its water disinfection over to a chlorination system "to ensure better control."

Alicia Demirjian, the CDC epidemic intelligence service officer who worked on the outbreak in Pittsburgh, was surprised to hear that Pittsburgh VA already has determined that the ionization system was the culprit in the outbreak since its investigation is not yet completed. "We're not sure if the ionization system was working properly," said Dr Demirjian, who was also aware that the VA called in Enrich this past summer. "We're not sure if the copper or silver were at the right levels."

Legionnaires' disease got its name in 1976, when many people who went to a Philadelphia convention of the American Legion suffered from an outbreak of the disease. About 8000 to 10 000 people each year are hospitalized with the disease, but the CDC and other experts believe many more cases occur each year that go undiagnosed as simple pneumonia or other afflictions. Legionnaires' [disease] can be fatal in 5 to 30 percent of cases, depending on who it strikes and where it is acquired.

The copper-silver ionization system was originally created as an alternative to keep swimming pools clean of bacteria, as a replacement for chlorine systems. It kills _Legionella_ -- the bacterium found in the natural environment that causes legionnaires' disease -- by regularly dispersing minute quantities of copper and silver into water systems. It is the combination of the copper and silver that studies show make the system effective in killing _Legionella_, although there is widespread dispute in the scientific community about what disinfection system is the best at preventing the spread of legionnaires' disease.

The CDC, for example, recommends the type of chlorination system that Pittsburgh VA said on Friday [16 Nov 2012] that it is switching to. The CDC said it is still waiting to see how many cases ultimately will be traced to the water system at the University Drive hospital.

Testing on the 1st 4 cases did not confirm a tie to the hospital's water system until 16 Nov 2012, when the hospital stopped using its water and began emergency disinfection procedures. Because the disease has an incubation period up to 14 days, more cases could arise for another 6 days. "As long as they're not using the water and we know it's not a source of transmission," there should not be any more cases after 30 Nov 2012, Dr Demirjian said. "So, we'll have to wait a little longer."

[For a discussion of legionnaires' disease, see moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Legionellosis, nosocomial - USA: (OH) 20110303.0692.

Although the articles above do not specify which _Legionella_ species has been implicated in the outbreak, presumably _Legionella pneumophila_ is involved because this organism causes most cases of legionnaires' disease.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The 2nd news report above says that "testing on the 1st 4 cases did not confirm a tie to the hospital's water system until 16 Nov 2012, when the hospital stopped using its water and began emergency disinfection procedures." By this presumably they mean that the clinical and environmental isolates of the _Legionella_ species were genotyped and matched. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because frequently the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

Elimination or reduction of _Legionella_ colonization in a hot water system is difficult, especially if the system is old. As temperatures over 55 deg C (131 deg F) kill _Legionella_, superheating of water to 71-77 deg C (160-171 deg F), from 43 deg C (110 deg F), the temperature usually used by most hospitals, or hyperchlorination (greater than 10 mg/liter of chlorine in water) for a period of time is recommended to eliminate _Legionella_ from a hot water system.
