The speed of reporting by the Dutch CVI and the rapid
characterization of the virus as a new strain, BT-6, not normally
seen in Europe are to be commended. Likewise the setting up of a
quarantine zone and control measures. What is frustrating though is
the long time it takes for field investigation to determine the cause
of emergence; to determine how and why this new strain popped up, or
I should say emerged, in an area of the world not previously known to
harbor this strain of virus. This, of course, is exactly what
happened in 2006 with the BT-8 strain and we eventually found the
presence of a new _Culicoides_ vector, which had spread north with an
usually warm summer along with recent climate changes. The
identification of causality in this new situation, may or may not
parallel what we learned in 2006 but it always takes time. Too often
more time than we have. However, an accurate understanding of the
holistic causality of this ongoing BT epidemic in Europe is critical
for future progress because this continues to be a devasting
epidemic, all the more so with the addition of the new BT-6 strain. - Mod.PC]
