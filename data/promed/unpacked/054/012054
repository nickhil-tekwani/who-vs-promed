At least 5 people have died and 58 are being
treated at Maumere General Hospital for dengue
fever in Sikka regency, East Nusa Tenggara.

The head of the disease control and environmental
health office in Sikka, Iskak Lafian Tori, said
Friday [30 May 2008] the epidemic has affected
Alok, East Alok, West Alok, Talibura, Lela,
Koting, Kewapante, and Kaegae districts.

"The epidemic has claimed at least 5 lives in the
past 2 months. We have deployed several teams to
carry out spraying in the affected districts and
to distribute free medicine to help relieve the
epidemic," he said.

He also called on locals to keep their
environment clean from the mosquitoes that spread
the virus and to avoid non-potable water.

A child, 7, a resident of Cakung, East Jakarta,
died Sunday [25 May 2008] after being
hospitalized for 3 days with dengue fever.

This child was the 2nd victim in the area this
year [2008], said Hairudin, an official in [the
child's] neighborhood, as quoted by
Beritajakarta.com.

He said he hoped the administration would conduct
fogging in his area to prevent further high
levels of breeding among _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes. "I expect them to act soon. We don't
want more victims," he said.

The East Jakarta health agency recorded 4762
people hospitalized with dengue fever in 2008.

[Fogging is not an effective measure to control _Aedes aegypti_
populations and provide significant reduction of dengue virus
transmission. Elimination of the water catchments in which this
mosquito breeds is effective.

Medical sources said on Monday [2 Jun 2008] the
number of people infected with dengue fever
amounted to more than 1000 cases in Shabwa
province, southeast of the Yemeni capital, Sana'a.

The sources were quoted by the independent
newsyemen.net as saying that the numbers of
dengue fever cases had increased remarkably in
some districts of the province.

The sources explained that field-spraying
processes are still continuous, pointing out that
the spraying campaign aims at eradicating
mosquitoes, which cause dengue fever.

Last week [26 May-1 Jun 2008], deputy director of
the Health bureau in Shabwa Ahmed Saeed said the
outbreak of the tropical epidemic has infected
more than 500 persons in the province during 2
days only.

Saeed voiced concern over the worsening health
conditions in Shabwa due to the proliferation of
dengue mosquitoes and the lack of health services
in order to combat the epidemic.

The dengue epidemic, which has hit Rio de
Janeiro, the most lethal in the history of
Brazil, has caused 123 deaths so far this year
[2008], and the [health] authorities said that
they are investigating another 116 deaths which
are suspected to have been caused by the disease,
the [Health] Secretariat said.

Since January [2008], 162 701 dengue cases have
been reported in the state of Rio de Janeiro,
said the Secretariat of Health in a news release
issued Wednesday night [28 May 2008].

The most cases of [dengue] infection, 87 589, are
from the city of Rio, the major tourist
attraction in Brazil, which also leads with the
number of fatalities due to the disease, with a
total of 75.

In the state, 42 percent of the deaths occurred
in [children] less than 15 years of age, the
Secretariat said.

Dengue [virus] is transmitted by the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito, for which the hot and humid
climate of Rio provides good conditions for its
reproduction.

Although the current [dengue] epidemic is not the
one that has caused the most infections in
Brazil, it has had the highest mortality rate.
The greatest previous epidemic recorded in
Brazil, which also occurred in Rio de Janeiro,
was that of 2002 when 288 000 people were
infected and 91 died.

indicated that the greatest number of recorded dengue cases were
concentrated in the 15-49 year age cohort, with 54 percent of the cases.

While the tragedy of dengue in Sergipe starts to
show signs that this deadly disease is cooling,
the truth is that the numbers produced by it up
until now are horrifying.

There have been 20 174 reported [dengue] cases
and 8726 confirmations, per the numbers
officially released by the Secretariat of Health
of the state calculated as of 21 May [2008]. Also
in the month of April [2008], there were 13 266
dengue case notifications and 4780 confirmations,
resulting in an incidence of 652.4 cases per 100
000 population. May [2008], when there
has usually been a decline in the number of [dengue]
cases, also had alarming figures: there have been
2404 reported [dengue cases] and 1262 confirmed
[cases], for an incidence of 118.2 [dengue cases]
per 100 000 population.

These [data] are taking into account only the
1st 21 days of the month. As for DHF (dengue
hemorrhagic fever) cases, 119 have been
confirmed. There have been 334 cases of dengue
with complications confirmed throughout the State.

Last week, with the possibility of 3 more deaths
directly related to the illness, Sergipe has
taken over 1st place in the [fatality] ranking,
now that it proportionately [per unit of
population], has had more dengue deaths in 2008.
According to official figures of the state
Secretariat of Health, already there have been 21
confirmed [dengue] deaths and another 17 are
under investigation.

If one takes just the number of officially
confirmed dengue deaths, Sergipe is in 1st place
for this calamity; by dividing the 21 cases by
the total number of Sergipe's inhabitants, we
have 1.08 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants. And if
there is confirmation of cases under
investigation, the [incidence] reaches 2.11
deaths per 100 000 inhabitants.

[All eyes are turned to Rio de Janeiro, but the
higher incidence appears to have been Sergipe, at
least for incidence of deaths. However, there is
a known bias in the Brazilian dengue surveillance
system. DHF is underdiagnosed and reported, and
the result is this rather absurd situation of
more deaths than DHF [cases]. The WHO
classification is used, but few physicians are
able to use it correctly. - Mod.LJS

It is not only Brazil that has a problem with the
WHO definition of DHF -- other countries have
also complained that the WHO definition is not
appropriate to their circumstances. - Mod.JW]

Guyana's Ministry of Health has called on
residents to remain alert as a result of 12
confirmed cases of dengue fever in region 9,
Lethem, close to the Guyana-Brazil border.

Health minister Dr Leslie Ramsammy said over the
past month there have been a number of reported
cases of fever in the region 9 area.

Over the last 4 weeks the Ministry has noted the
increase of reported fever cases from Region 9,
especially Lethem, and investigation revealed
that these cases were not due to malaria. A test
for dengue fever confirmed that some 12 cases
were the result of recent infection with the
dengue virus and were among persons in and around
Lethem, the minister said.

The minister added that cases occur sporadically
in Georgetown and all the coastal regions but
more so in the Lethem area of Region 9 and the
public has been advised that care must be taken
to avoid mosquito bites.

"The Ministry is recommending the use of mosquito
nets and, if possible, insecticide-treated nets
must be used, especially by pregnant women and
children under 5 years. Everyone should sleep
under a net" a release from the health ministry
outlined.

According to health officials, the use of insect
repellents can prevent mosquito bites if used as
recommended and residents are being urged to use
protective clothing, especially while being
outdoors at night, and to avoid dark colours
since they attract mosquitoes.
