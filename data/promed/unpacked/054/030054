We are investigating several cases of highly suspected histoplasmosis in a group of Italian speleologists [cave scientists] who were in Mexico (Chiapas region) from [1-13 Mar 2019]. They all slept in a cave, La Cueva del Rio La Venta, for a total of 4 nights [from 4-8 Mar 2019]. Bats and bat guano were noticed at the entrance and exit of the cave, measuring approximately 12 kilometers [about 7.5 mi] in length.

Up to now, 9 of 18 travelers developed typical symptoms of acute pulmonary histoplasmosis (fever, shortness of breath, dry cough, fatigue, headache) that mostly started 5-7 days after return. 6 individuals were found to have multiple lung nodules on high-resolution chest CT scan and 2 were admitted to our department due to more severe symptoms. We are collecting sera for serology. 6 of them, due to the presence of symptoms and pulmonary lesions, began the treatment with itraconazole.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Gobbi for submitting the report of an outbreak of an acute febrile respiratory illness suspected to be due to _Histoplasma capsulatum_ in a group of Italian spelunkers after exploring a cave in Chiapas, Mexico.

Chiapas is the southernmost state in Mexico along the Pacific coastline. Its topography is mountainous with karst formations and caves. La Cueva del Rio La Venta is apparently a major tourist attraction in this area (http://ropewiki.com/Rio_La_Venta_Expedition). A map showing the location of Chiapas can be found at https://goo.gl/maps/r75zAe75Lak.

_Histoplasma capsulatum_, a dimorphic fungus that grows in a mycelial form at ambient temperatures and grows as yeast at body temperature in mammals, is found worldwide in soil enriched by bird or bat droppings. Contaminated soil can be potentially infectious for years. Fungal spores become airborne during activities that disturb the contaminated soil, such as spelunking, mining, construction, excavation, demolition, roofing, chimney cleaning, farming, or gardening, which can lead to clusters of cases of histoplasmosis that follow inhalation of the aerosolized spores. The spores can travel distances downstream from the source in currents of air. Because of the presence of bats in caves, cave exploration is a known risk factor for histoplasmosis, which is sometimes known as "cave fever" (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10403317). Physicians should be aware of the association between histoplasmosis and caving when caring for individuals who develop an acute febrile respiratory illness after cave exploration (http://tinyurl.com/yxjust7x).

Another disease that has also acquired the name "cave fever" is tick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF). See ProMED-mail posts Tick-borne relapsing fever - Israel: spelunkers, tourists 20180422.5761531 and Tick-borne relapsing fever - USA: (TX) cave workers, 2017 20180420.5759542.

Although birds cannot be infected by the _H. capsulatum_ and do not transmit the disease, bats can become infected by _H. capsulatum_ and may harbor the fungus in their gut (https://academic.oup.com/jtm/article/15/2/133/1801173).

In the US, histoplasmosis is endemic in the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi River valleys, where it is caused by _H. capsulatum_ var. _capsulatum_. Histoplasmosis has also been reported in Mexico, Central and South America, Oceania, Asia, Africa, and Europe (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4535725/). In Africa, histoplasmosis occurs most commonly in west and central Africa, particularly where it is caused by the _duboisii_ variety, which has yeast cells that average about twice the size of _H. capsulatum_ var. _capsulatum_ (http://www.reviberoammicol.com/1997-14/155159.pdf).

Most individuals with histoplasmosis are asymptomatic. Those who develop clinical manifestations are usually immunocompromised or are exposed to a high quantity of inoculum. Disseminated disease is especially more common in HIV/AIDS-associated cases. - Mod.ML
