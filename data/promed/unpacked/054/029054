The worst outbreak of killer anthrax spores in the Northwest Territories in 2 decades has left 128 wood bison dead northwest of Fort Providence.

The decaying carcasses, spread over an area of 10 sq km [about 4 sq mi], were spotted on a routine anthrax surveillance flight on [3 Jul 2012]. A team went in and several of the dead animals field-tested positive for anthrax, a naturally occurring spore exacerbated by hot periods following extreme wetness.

It will take up to 6 weeks to dispose of the rotting hulks. A burn team of 4 people, clad completely in protective gear against the deadly spores, will first treat the animals with formaldehyde to deter scavengers and kill spores. Seasonal forest fire fighters will bring in incineration supplies; an 800-kilogram bull requires 4 cords of firewood and 5 bags of coal to burn, which also burns the soil underneath them to get rid of spores. [There is an excellent photograph in this report of a bison carcass being prepared for burning. - Mod.MHJ]

The dead animals were part of the Mills Lake area herd of about 300 animals. The animals belong to the Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary [MBS] herd of 2000 prairie-loving bison. Unusual in the bison world, the herd is considered disease-free, without the tuberculosis and brucellosis that plague their bison brothers in the Slave River and Wood Buffalo herds, McLinton said. In 1993, 172 bison from the Slave River herd were killed by anthrax. In 2010, an outbreak killed 9 of the animals.

To try and answer your questions:

1. Animals found on 3 Jul 2012 were estimated to be up to 10 days old based on carcass condition.

2. Bison have been using the Mills Lake area for some time, at least since the late 1980s. It is not uncommon to see large bison herds in the Mills area -- the habitat is not as consistently flooded out -- which has been the case with the core Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary areas which include Falaise Lake, Boulogne Lake, etc. There is one large bison herd in the vicinity that numbers approximately 150 live animals. [Note: it is now the summer breeding season and active clustering is going on. Such wood bison groups are a fraction of the size of plains bison herds at this time. - Mod.MHJ]

3. The 1st documentation of anthrax deaths in the Mills Lake area occurred in the summer of 2010. Dead bison were not found in that area in the 1993 outbreak.

4. I have not been on site, Terry (Armstrong) or Brett [Elkin, Veterinary Pathologist/Disease Contaminants Specialist, GNWT] may be able to provide information on tabanids for you once they get a chance to catch their breath. Been a rather hectic couple of days.

5. We have also now found dead bison along highway 3 -- heading north of Fort Providence -- about 6 of them.

6. Weather in the Fort Providence forecasted to stay in the high 20's or low 30's [deg C, 80s-90s deg F] for the next week.

7. Things should be up to speed here in the next day or so, team is in place and the disposal processes are under way.

Take the 128 figure with some caution, it may be revised as we process carcasses and get a precise count. There are still 125-150 live animals in the area at Mills Lake. If no animals have left that area since the outbreak began, we have 30-50 percent local mortality there. At this point we're over 130 carcasses, which is approaching 10 percent of the March [2012] estimate for the entire Mackenzie population. Recent finds are not at Mills Lake but to the east near the highway and now in Moose Prairie.

Previous flight: there wasn't one. The flight scheduled for the previous week was postponed due to an operational glitch. I'm sure this outbreak was rolling 10 days or more before the flight on 3 Jul 2012.

Tabanids: numbers seem high but that's a relative term. Brett's en route to Yellowknife and among other tasks, will try to find a bug net for me so I can capture some tabanids for analysis.

Burning is under way, but unfortunately we've been occupied dealing with carcasses along the highway and at a local construction site. We're staffing up and 2 crews are at Mills Lake now.

[Many thanks to Troy and Terry for their on-the-spot updates. Understatement is not limited to the Brits, I see. Only a hectic couple of days?

I have heard comments that I overstate the part played by biting flies. But when you have seen numbers of wildlife outbreaks where the disease spread has jumped 8 ft (2.5 m) fences and anything from 100 m [110 yards] to 2 km [1.25 mi] on the same or adjoining ranches it is hard to envisage any other mode of spread. And in this epidemic at Mills Lake in the breeding season when bison bulls are nervously herding their cow harems and seeing off other competing bulls, infected "grazing" cannot explain the more than 128 dead bison. And next spring [2013] when animals will be darted and bled for tuberculosis and brucellar surveillance we can expect to see about 90 percent of the survivors with strong antibody titres, as we did after the 1993 MBS epidemic. What we do lack in this epidemiologic component is some hard data on the numbers of female tabanid flies with contaminated mouthparts in spatial relation to confirmed carcasses.
