Rabies, human, animal, Russia on the whole and Lipetsk region, Russia
-------------------------------------------
About 3000 cases of rabies among animals have been registered during the
first 5 months of 2005 in Russia and [there were] 9 fatal cases among
people who had contact with infected animals.
In the village of Krasnoye in the Lipetsk region, a sick dog bit 5
children, all of whom have been taken [to the] regional hospital. Since the
beginning of 2005, 1500 persons have presented themselves for consultation
and medical aid in Lipetsk. Among wild animals, foxes are usually the first
to fall ill, and illness is transferred to domestic animals.

Rabies, human, Moscow-Lipetsk, Russia
------------------------------------------
A man has died from rabies in Moscow after visiting relatives in the
Zadonskiy district of the Lipetsk region. In June 2005, in the forest near
Zadonskiy, he killed and skinned a fox, when he was probably infected. The
man felt discomfort when he returned to Moscow, but he sought medical aid
too late.
Preventive vaccination has been given to all members of his family,
including relatives in the Lipetsk region.
Already in 2005, 120 foci [cases?] of rabies have been registered in the
Lipetsk region (most in Lipetsk and Dolgorukovsky districts; there were
only 60 in all of 2004). 65 percent of the infected animals are foxes, 18
percent are dogs, almost 14 percent are domestic cattle.
Already 228 persons are in a high-risk group -- they have bitten by or had
contact with sick animals. 3 of them have refused to undergo vaccination.

Rabies, domestic hamster, Astrakhan region
----------------------------------------
The rabies virus has been found in a domestic hamster in Astrakhan.
Inhabitants of a 9-story [building] purchased an animal in a market in
Bolshiye Isady. The hamster fell ill and died after a week after purchase,
but not before biting [an] 8-year-old girl, her mother, and a domestic cat.
Owners have turned the dead hamster over to veterinarians, who made the
rabies diagnosis. All pets living in this house and in nearby houses have
been quickly vaccinated by employees of the Astrakhan veterinary station.
121 dogs and 38 cats were vaccinated in total. According to data from the
city's service of sanitary epidemiological supervision, rabies among
animals in Astrakhan has been registered annually in recent years. In 2004
rabies was laboratory-confirmed in 5 animals (2 dogs, 2 cats, and 1
rodent). 4 persons have died from rabies in the Astrakhan region during
January - May 2005.

[My doubts about the reliability of the hamster case (who made the
diagnosis and how?) are not unrelated to the following commentary appended
to posting 20030106.0041: "It is very unusual for hamsters -- or any rodent
-- to carry rabies, principally because they usually die from the effects
of the bite of the rabid animal (dog or cat) before they can get sick. The
source of the infection (bats? in Peru?) needs to be traced. We speculate
that they have chosen to categorically vaccinate the under-5-year-olds
because any self-reported history of bite or saliva contact would be less
reliable in them. - Mods.MPP/JW"
There was a tragic case in Israel in 1996 when a person who timely reported
to have been bitten at night while sleeping outdoors, by an animal he
suspected to be a small rat or mouse, remained untreated. The biting animal
was not found and, obviously, not tested. 39 days later the patient was
diagnosed with rabies, and it became apparent that the biting animal could
have been a small nocturnal carnivore such as a stone-marten, a kitten, or
a mongoose. - Mod.AS]
[A disoriented and aggressive rabid animal could have passed the
virus-contaminated saliva on to an animal in a cage indirectly, infecting
it. Why not? - Mod.RY]
