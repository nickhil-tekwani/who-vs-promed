On 4 Jan 2010, the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Guinea reported a case
of yellow fever [YF] to the World Health Organization (WHO). The case
occurred in the prefecture of Mandiana belonging to the Kankan region
in the east of the country, near the border with Cote d'Ivoire. Cote
d'Ivoire has recently conducted an outbreak response in the border
health districts of Minignan and Madinani.

The case in Guinea was a 35-year-old woman from the village of
Malikila, sub-prefecture of Faralako, prefecture of Mandiana. On 23
Nov 2009, she presented with a clinical syndrome of fever and
jaundice. The case was detected by cross-border investigation of the
outbreak in Cote d'Ivoire. Following an outbreak investigation
conducted by the Ministry of Health, a further 6 suspected cases were
found in the sub-prefecture of Faralako, Mandiana-Centre and Saladou.
These cases are under laboratory investigation.

The regional reference laboratory for yellow fever at Institut Pasteur
in Dakar, Senegal, confirmed the yellow fever case by plaque reduction
neutralization test (PRNT). Other haemorrhagic fevers were excluded by
specific tests.

Following the detection of this case, the MoH has decided to vaccinate
the entire population of the Mandiana prefecture. A total of 12
sub-prefectures with 290 292 people are targeted for an emergency
reactive mass vaccination campaign, scheduled for the 3rd week of
January 2010. Vaccines have been made available from the global
emergency vaccine stockpile, managed by the International Coordinating
Group for Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) with funding from
the GAVI Alliance and ECHO.

Guinea is one of the high-risk endemic countries in Africa where a
series of preventive mass vaccination campaigns has been implemented
since 2007. Mandiana prefecture is one of the 25 prefectures in the
country considered to be at highest risk of yellow fever. The
prefecture was selected for preventive mass vaccination during the
National Risk Assessment meeting in September 2008; however, the
national campaign has not yet taken place due to limited vaccine
supply. It is now scheduled to take place in 2010.

[If the 6 suspected YF cases are confirmed, their scattered occurrence
in 3 sub-prefectures suggest that these are cases of sylvan YF in the
endemic area. There have been no further reports of YF cases across
the border in the Cote d'Ivoire. One hopes that the Guinea national YF
vaccination campaign will be initiated soon, before additional cases
occur and to reduce the risk of an urban outbreak.
