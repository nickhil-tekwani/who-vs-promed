First report of Sida golden yellow vein virus infecting _Sida_ species in Cuba
A.L. Echemendia (Instituto de Investigaciones de Sanidad Vegetal, 110 #
514, Playa. La Habana. CP 11600. Cuba); P.L. Ramos
<pedro.ramos@cigb.edu.cu>; L. DÃ­az (as for Ramos); R. Peral (as for Ramos);
A. Fuentes (as for Ramos); M. Pujol (as for Ramos); and G. Gonzalez (as
for Echemendia). Accepted for publication 29 Sep 2003.
Members of the genus _Sida_ are common weeds in the Caribbean and Central
America. _Sida_ spp. with leaves showing yellow mottling have been commonly
observed in Cuba. To identify the causal agent(s), symptomatic leaves from
_Sida_ plants were collected in the provinces of Havana, Santa Clara, and
Guantanamo between 1999 and 2001.
Healthy _Phaseolus vulgaris_ L. plants were inoculated using a bioballistic
method (Finer et al., 1992) with total DNA extracts purified from infected
leaves collected in Havana. Yellow mosaic and curling leaf symptoms were
observed in 3 of 15 inoculated bean plants.
The presence of a begomovirus in both _Phaseolus_ and _Sida_ samples was
shown by strong hybridization signals in Southern blots using DNA-A from
Bean golden yellow mosaic virus-Cu as a probe, under high stringency
conditions.
Total DNA from the Havana Sida sample was further analyzed by PCR using 2
degenerate primer sets; PAL1v1978-PAR1c715 and PAL1c1960-PAR1v722 (Rojas et
al., 1993). Amplicons of approximately 1.4 kb and 1.2 kb were amplified and
cloned into pZeroTM-2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen, CA, USA) using standard
procedures.
Nucleotide sequences were compared to those from known begomoviruses using
Clustal W analysis. For the coat protein (753 nucleotides [nt]) and rep
genes (1080 nt), the highest percentages of identity (93.5 and 99 percent
respectively) were to Sida golden yellow vein virus (SiGYVV, GenBank
Accession No. U77964).
In addition, the Cuban isolate (DNA-A 2600 nt) showed 97percent nt sequence
identity with SiGYVV-A. Common region (CR) analysis of SiGYVV-Cu A revealed
98 percent identity when compared to SiGYVV-CR. Similar interons were
identified in both viruses. These results confirm that the virus isolated
from _Sida_ plants in the province of Havana (GenBank Accession No. AJ
577395) is a strain of SiGYVV.
This is the first identification of SiGYVV in Cuba.

[To my knowledge, SiGYVV has not been previously reported to infect bean.
If any of our readers in the Caribbean and Central America know of reports
documenting infection of bean or other food crop legumes by SiGYVV, I would
appreciate receiving them. Weeds such as _S. rhombifolia_ have been
suggested as natural reservoirs from which the whitefly, _Bemisia
argentifolii_, spreads SiGYVV to tomato, a preferred host. In addition to
SiGYVV, there are at least 4 other geminiviruses that infect _Sida_ spp.
(golden mosaic, mottle, yellow vein, and yellow mosaic). - Mod.DH]
