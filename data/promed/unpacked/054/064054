Another animal has tested positive for plague in the Denver metro [area]. A
squirrel in Aurora is now the 18th animal to have [a confirmed diagnosis of
the disease]. Most of the squirrels have been found around City Park, where
parents, and pet owners have plenty of questions.
Health officials say fleas that jump from animal to animal spread the
disease. [Humans can become ill if infected fleas get on them, as is the
case of 4 people in Colorado who contracted plague last year [2006]. One
person died from the disease in 2004. Vets say cats are very susceptible to
plague. Dogs are usually immune, but can carry infected fleas inside the house.
The best advice is to not touch dead animals, and to keep a close eye out
for fleas on pets. Early signs among pets include swollen lymph nodes and
breathing problems.

Boulder (Colorado) officials announced Monday [14 May 2007], that fleas
collected on May 8 [2007] near 63rd Street and the Diagonal Highway have
tested positive for plague.
Employees posted signs at the area, near the base of the Boulder Reservoir
dam, and next to the city of Boulder Water Treatment Plant, and the city
plans to dust some prairie dog burrows with a pesticide to reduce the
chance of plague exposure from fleas.
The announcement came one week after Boulder Parks officials closed Tom
Watson Park near IBM because they were concerned that a prairie dog colony
there was infected with plague. The park reopened the next day.
"While the current location of affected prairie dog colonies does not
warrant the closure of city property at this time, we urge all visitors to
Coot Lake, Tom Watson Park, and the Boulder Reservoir dam to keep pets on
leashes and out of prairie dog areas," said Jan Geden, city director of
Parks and Recreation. "Our city staff will continue monitoring adjacent
prairie dog colonies and take necessary steps to inform and protect the
public should the disease spread to other areas."
Plague is a bloodborne disease most commonly transmitted by fleas. Public
health officials urge residents to protect pets with flea powder and keep
them away from areas where wild rodents live. Residents also should prevent
rodent infestations around houses and treat rodent sites with flea powder.

[3] California - domestic cat

The Kern County Department of Public Health learned on Thursday [10 May
2007] that a domestic cat from Hart Flat, California, had tested positive
for _Yersinia pestis_, a bacterium that causes plague. The case is under
investigation by the Department of Public Health as well as the Vector
Control Section of the California Department of Health Services.
So far, there is no evidence of human infection, but those that may have
[been exposed to] the infected cat and that cat itself have been given
antibiotics. The Department of Public Health says cats are believed to be
the domestic species most susceptible to plague.

<http://www.dhs.ca.gov/ps/dcdc/disb/pdf/Vector-Borne%20Diseases%20in%20California,%20Annual%20Report%202005.pdf>,
which indicates that during 2005, plague was confirmed from 3 cats in Kern
County. Kern County is the large county located directly above Los Angeles
County and may be viewed at
<http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/maps/california_map.html>.
Prairie dogs are generally considered one of the sentinel animals with
regard to plague. The collection and testing of the fleas is an early
surveillance for the disease. There are many flea treatments and repellants
appropriate for pets and available from veterinarians. It is advisable to
visit the veterinarian, as some products may be suitable for dogs but not
cats or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. To avoid
toxic problems with flea protection products, please consult your veterinarian.

Coot Lake, Tom Watson Park, and the Boulder Reservoir dam appear to be
north of the airport and just to the west of diagonal highway 119.
