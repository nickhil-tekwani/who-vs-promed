[The following Eurosurveillance report confirms circulation of chikungunya
virus in the Maldives. - Mod.TY]

Chikungunya infection in a French traveller returning from the Maldives,
October, 2009
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[authors: Receveur M, Ezzedine K, Pistone T, Malvy D]

Summary
-------
In recent years, cases of chikungunya fever have been reported in
international travellers returning from the Indian Ocean region. The cases
have been linked to the re-emergence of chikungunya fever on Indian Ocean
islands in 2006. We describe the 1st case of chikungunya fever in a French
traveller returning from Male, an island of the Maldives islands,
confirming the permanence of virus circulation by the end of 2009.

Case report
-----------
A French male in his 30s presented at the post-travel clinic of the
Department of Internal Medicine and Tropical Diseases of the University
Hospital Centre, Bordeaux, France in October 2009 with symptoms of
recurrent high-grade fever (up to 40 deg C/104 deg F), headache,
generalised muscle aches, and severe joint pain mainly affecting fingers,
wrists, knees, and ankles, and an itching skin rash, since 3 days. 2 days
before, he had returned directly from a holiday trip to the Maldives where
he had stayed for 14 days exclusively in the northern part of Male Island.

Chikungunya virus serology testing was conducted for specific
immunoglobulin (Ig) G and M using IgM-capture and IgG-sandwich
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with inactivated
cell-culture-ground chikungunya virus and mouse anti-chikungunya
hyperimmune ascitic fluid at the National Reference Centre for Arboviruses,
Institut Pasteur, Paris, France. Serology for chikungunya virus revealed
positive results for both specific IgM (optic density (OD)=1.633; serum
control OD=0.073) and IgG (OD=0.475; serum control OD=0.096).

Paired serology for specific IgG and M by ELISA against dengue virus and
Japanese B encephalitis were negative, as well as tests for leptospirosis,
rickettsiosis, Q fever, West Nile virus, and cytomegalovirus. A real-time
PCR test was negative for dengue viruses and chikungunya virus RNA. Fever
decreased the day following the consultation, but severe joint pain
persisted over 6 weeks until the end of December [2009] despite symptomatic
treatment.

Discussion
----------
Over the last couple of years and following successive waves of outbreaks
in the Indian Ocean area since 2006, chikungunya has increasingly been
reported in travellers returning from vacation in the region and in
expatriates or immigrants back from visits to their home countries.

The new case described provides definite evidence of ongoing chikungunya
virus transmission in the Maldives. To the best of our knowledge, this case
is reportedly the 3rd confirmed chikungunya fever case imported from the
Maldives since the 1st documented outbreak of chikungunya in Male and other
islands of the Maldives that lasted from December 2006 to April 2007,
followed by a suspected cluster on the Laamu Atoll from December 2008 to
January 2009, and the report of 2 confirmed cases in German travellers, a
father and son returning from a 10-day visit to the Maldives in
mid-September 2009.

The region is probably one of the most popular travel destinations in the
Indian Ocean area. This may result in an increase of symptomatic travellers
returning from this area and seeking medical advice at travel or primary
care clinics. Hence, chikungunya together with dengue fever should be
considered as an important differential diagnosis in those patients,
assuming that both diseases are endemic in certain regions of India and the
Indian Ocean area and may present with similar symptoms.

For more than 10 years, dengue fever was the only vector-borne viral
disease reported in the Maldives. _Aedes aegypti_ and _A. albopictus_, the
dengue virus vectors, which can also transmit the chikungunya virus, have
been identified in the Maldives, with _A. aegypti_ identified as the
predominant vector in Male. The 1st chikungunya fever outbreak occurred
from December 2006 - April 2007 with abrupt onset and high attack rates due
to the lack of herd immunity. Epidemics may occur following an interval of
20-30 years of the virus not circulating as has been the case in western
Africa and Malaysia. Confirmed imported cases among travellers support the
assumption of endemic circulation of the virus, which is consistent with
the prevailing chikungunya epidemic in the Indian Ocean region.

This report highlights the need for surveillance in countries where
emerging infections may be introduced by returning travellers as in the
case with the Italian chikungunya fever epidemic, which occurred in the
province of Ravenna in 2007. It illustrates how travellers can serve as
sentinel population providing information regarding the emergence or
re-emergence of an infectious pathogen in a source region. Travellers can
thus act as carriers who inadvertently ferry pathogens that can be used to
map the location, dynamics, and movement of pathogenic strains. Thus, with
the increase in intercontinental travel, travellers can provide insights
into the level of the risk of transmission of infections in other
geographical regions.

[There have been a number of confirmed and suspected chikungunya cases
acquired on the Maldives in September and October 2009 reported in the

chikungunya virus on the Maldives that year.
