Destruction of more than 400 000 chickens at a San Bernardino County
commercial farm was ordered on Wednesday after testing positive for a
disease that has forced the quarantine of southern California's poultry. It
was the fifth commercial chicken farm hit by exotic Newcastle disease,
which is a threat to the state's USD 3 billion industry and forced the
slaughter of more than 1.7 million chickens since it was discovered in
September.
The farm, which was not identified, was near backyard flocks that were
infected with the disease, said Larry Cooper, spokesman for the California
Department of Food and Agriculture.
The quarantine prohibits the movement of all poultry, poultry products and
nesting materials in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, Riverside,
Orange, San Diego, and Imperial counties. California is the nation's third
largest egg producer. More than 9 million of the state's 12 million
egg-laying hens are in the quarantine zone.

State health officials are investigating whether exotic Newcastle disease,
which has affected hundreds of thousands of chickens in the Inland area,
caused an eye infection in 2 workers involved in the eradication effort.
Tests are being performed on the 2 who -- along with 635 other workers --
are destroying infected and exposed birds, said Michele Jay, acting state
public health veterinarian. She said studies indicate people who come into
direct contact with infected birds could get the eye disease, officially
called conjunctivitis and commonly known as "pinkeye". While Newcastle is
highly contagious and nearly always fatal to birds, state officials have
previously said the disease does not harm humans.
To try to stop the disease from spreading, more than 1.2 million birds
infected with or exposed to Newcastle have been ordered to be euthanized at
egg ranches and back yards in Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Diego
counties since 1 Oct 2002.
The state has imposed a quarantine that forbids birds from being moved
outside 8 southern California counties, although sanitized eggs are exempt.
Jay said the virus is present in the secretions of infected poultry but is
not found in poultry meat or eggs.
"The only possibility of risk (to humans) is occupational," she said. She
said the state Department of Health Services last week received a swab
culture taken from the reddened eye of a worker on the eradication task
force. A swab of eye secretions also has been taken from a second task
force worker and will be sent to the state for analysis, Jay said.
Both workers have fully recovered, Jay said. She said she didn't know where
the workers were assigned. Jay said it will take another 1 to 3 weeks
before the department's laboratory in Richmond determines whether Newcastle
caused conjunctivitis in the first worker.
Annette Whiteford, the veterinarian leading the Newcastle disease task
force, said workers whose eyes are inflamed may have picked up some
infection or irritation other than Newcastle in the recent high winds. Jay
said the state will continue to monitor task force workers for
conjunctivitis. She said workers with eye inflammations will be sent to
private physicians to obtain eye swabs for analysis by the state.
Richard Matteis, executive director of the Pacific Egg and Poultry
Association, a Sacramento-based trade association for egg producers, said
he hadn't known Newcastle might cause pinkeye. He said all the government
informational releases he has seen on the outbreak claimed there is no
human health risk.
Little has been documented about the effect of Newcastle on humans, Jay
said. She said that in 1943, a laboratory worker developed conjunctivitis
after his eye was accidentally splashed with an egg inoculated with the
disease. In 1952, another person got conjunctivitis after his eye was
accidentally splashed with live virus.
In addition, Jay said, there have been claims of influenza-like illness
after the Newcastle virus was inhaled, although she said no link between
such symptoms and the virus has been scientifically confirmed. She said a
1981 survey of poultry workers in India, where Newcastle is permanently
established, found that 38 per cent of the workers tested positive for
having antibodies for the disease, although they had no outward symptoms.
By contrast, she said, only 4 per cent of the general public in India
tested positive for the disease antibodies.

[Mild conjunctivitis and influenza-like symptoms have been reported in
people working in poultry processing plants and laboratories. These mild
signs do not occur in all processing plants or laboratories and since they
are mild, and limited, there is no serious effect on human health. - Mod.TG]
