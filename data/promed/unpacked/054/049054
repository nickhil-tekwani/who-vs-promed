Multiple respiratory viruses identified in travelers with respiratory infections returning from the Hajj
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Recently, there was a description of influenza A diagnoses in suspect Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) patients from Calgary Alberta, Canada (Influenza (49): Canada ex Saudi Arabia, Hajj returnees, susp. 20151005.3693052).

This post will identify the collaborative work undertaken to identify respiratory etiologies in patients returning from the Hajj. Prior to the beginning of the 2015 Hajj, Alberta Health Services released an information document to physicians province-wide indicating that Medical Officers of Health (MOH) should be as the point person for clinicians to contact for MERS-CoV investigations in patients with influenza-like illness (ILI) returning from the Hajj. Between [28 Sep 2015 and 3 Oct 2015], 3 suspect cases, and 3 contacts with ILI who had recently returned from the Hajj were screened for MERS-CoV, using nasopharyngeal swabs, a combination of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, and/or sputum. A diversity of illness was identified with 2 of 3 suspect cases hospitalized. None of the 3 contacts of the cases were hospitalized. For one hospitalized case, symptoms included cough, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and sputum production. For the other hospitalized case, symptoms included chills, cough, fever, shortness of breath, and sputum production. Symptoms in the non-hospitalized case included chills, cough, and fever. Testing for MERS-CoV was done using a lab-developed test for the UpE gene. Specimens were also tested for influenza A and B using lab-developed tests which utilized CDC-developed primers and probes. All influenza A-positive tests were subtyped using real-time RT-PCR assays for H3 and pdm(09). In some cases, specimens were tested for other respiratory pathogens using the Luminex RVP Classic Assay.

All primary suspect cases and all contacts were negative for MERS-CoV. All 3 primary suspect cases were positive for influenza A H3. Of the 3 ill contacts, one contact case was influenza A positive and subtyped as pdm(09) and also tested positive for entero-rhinovirus. A 2nd contact was negative for influenza A/B, but positive for entero-rhinovirus. A 3rd contact was negative for influenza A/B as well as all targets on the Luminex RVP.

This communication outlines the importance the approach used in Alberta for screening patients presenting with ILI and/or severe respiratory illness following their recent return from the Hajj pilgrimage, and the importance we place on monitoring for MERS-CoV infections in travelers from affected regions. It also identifies that a variety of respiratory pathogens, including co-infections, may be encountered by individuals who are returning from the Hajj. It is not unexpected that that returning travelers may have been infected with a diversity of viral pathogens, and we should emphasize vigilance in screening for these patients using a coordinated approach between public health and the various partners within the health care system.
