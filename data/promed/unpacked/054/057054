[Anthrax in calves is not common. To have enough meat to share with 288 people, it would have had to have been a yearling. But how this "yearling" got infected has not been revealed. Without other animals affected, it was probably from this animal choosing an unfortunate place to graze, a contaminated cattle gravesite.
