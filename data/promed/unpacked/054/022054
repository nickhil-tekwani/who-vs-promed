One person has died in connection to a 2nd cluster of Legionnaires' disease discovered in Washington Heights [northern neighborhood in the New York City borough of Manhattan] this year [2018], officials announced [Wed 10 Oct 2018]. The Health Department was notified of the death by the hospital early [Wed 10 Oct 2018] morning. The victim has not yet been identified.

Of 15 other cases -- 7 people remain hospitalized, 7 have been discharged from the hospital and 1 was seen as an outpatient. More cases are possible as Washington Heights residents go to their doctors.

Health officials say _Legionella_ bacterium was found in a cooling tower connected to commercial AC units. Officials say the bacterium was not found in the water supply, and that water is safe to drink.

A total of 20 cooling towers have been tested, but those results will take 2 weeks. As a precaution, owners of 11 towers that had preliminary positive tests were preemptively ordered to remediate.

In a teleconference [Wed 10 Oct 2018] afternoon, acting health commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said the department's suspicion is the hot weather leading up to the cluster was the cause. Barbot released the following statement:

"The Health Department has confirmed 16 cases of Legionnaires' disease associated with the Lower Washington Heights cluster. One person who had underlying health conditions has died. New York City has the strongest enforcement regarding cooling towers in the nation, and we continue to take very aggressive steps to respond to this cluster and prevent more people from becoming sick. The Health Department has investigated every cooling tower in the area, ordering landlords to remediate where necessary and has provided information to residents. The risk to residents of contracting Legionnaire's disease remains very low; however, adults with flu-like symptoms, like fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should seek immediate medical attention so a doctor can determine whether _Legionella_ testing is needed. Legionnaires' disease is not contagious and is easily treatable with antibiotics. People get Legionnaires disease by breathing in water vapor containing the bacteria."

The previous cluster ended in mid-August [2018] and the latest cluster began in late September [2018].

The source of the latest outbreak is still under investigation and the city is taking "aggressive steps" to determine why a 2nd major outbreak has hit Washington Heights in a matter of months, Barbot said.

City health officials have tested the cooling towers of 20 buildings in Washington Heights for signs of the _Legionella_ bacteria, Barbot said. Preliminary test results at 11 buildings prompted officials to order the buildings to conduct biocide remediation. Preliminary results may indicate the presence of either dead bacteria or bacteria growth.

Complete test results will take at least 2 weeks to process, Barbot said [Wed 10 Oct 2018]. Buildings where the growth of _Legionella_ bacteria is found will be ordered to conduct a full cleaning and disinfecting of cooling towers.

The summer outbreak -- which ended in mid August [2018]-- was traced back to The Sugar Hill Project, a high-rise building on St. Nicholas Avenue near West 155th Street. Officials ordered The Sugar Hill Project to clean and disinfect its cooling systems due to the building's proximity to the new outbreak. The cleaning was completed on [5 Oct 2018], health officials said.

[Washington Heights is a mainly residential neighborhood in the northern portion of the New York City borough of Manhattan, in the US state of New York; Washington Heights is bounded on the south by West 115th Street and on the north by the neighborhood of Inwood (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Heights,_Manhattan).

During the prior Legionnaires' disease outbreak in lower Washington Heights in July-August 2018, a total of 27 cases with 1 death were traced to a cooling tower at The Sugar Hill Project, a housing complex at 898 St Nicholas Ave, located just south of West 155th Street. (The Sugar Hill housing complex is thus actually located in the Sugar Hill neighborhood, just south of Washington Heights.) At the time, the genotype of the _Legionella_ strain found in the cooling tower matched that of the strain found in 6 patients affected in the cluster. The cooling tower was then cleaned and disinfected on 13 Jul 2018 (see ProMED-mail post Legionellosis - USA (10): (NYC) more cases, fatal, cooling tower 20180816.5968728). A map showing the location of the Sugar Hill Project can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/898+St+Nicholas+Ave,+New+York,+NY+10032.

The 2 news articles above report a 2nd outbreak of Legionnaires' disease in lower Washington Heights that involves 16 patients, one of whom has died. 20 cooling towers have been tested for _Legionella_ so far and 11 that had "preliminary positive tests were preemptively ordered to remediate." The 2nd news report above says that the cooling towers for the Sugar Hill Project were recently cleaned again (worked completed on 5 Oct 2018) due to the building's proximity to the 2nd outbreak, but fails to say if the Sugar Hill cooling towers were among those that had preliminary positive tests. The potable water is said to be free of _Legionella_, and safe to drink. We await further developments in the epidemiological work-up of this 2nd outbreak. - Mod.ML
