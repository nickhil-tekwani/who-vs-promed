Approximately 600 hectares of corn crops in Kotabaru, South Kalimantan [are] threatened [by] rot disease. [Of these], 4 hectares have been attacked by stem rot disease caused by fungus, said a farmer.

The Kotabaru Agriculture Agency together with [the] Food Crops and Horticulture Protection (PTPH) Laboratory [are] providing fungicide assistance to prevent the spread of stem rot disease.

The affected corn plants look withered; yields are not optimal. The disease attacking young plants leads to plants dying before producing corn [which] could lead to crop failure. Currently, the stem rot [is] attacking plants [close to] harvest [stage].

[Fungal stem and stalk rots of maize may be due to a number of different species in genera such as _Fusarium_, _Cercospora_, _Rhizoctonia_, _Phoma_ and others. Stem rots in maize may also be caused by bacterial pathogens (for example, _Burkholderia_ sp.; ProMED-mail post 20101220.4482). These pathogens may also be associated with root rots and are often lethal to plants if they infect seedlings, as is mentioned in this report. Thus, the symptoms described above may apply to a range of pathogens and are not sufficient for reliable diagnosis, which is essential for effective disease management.
