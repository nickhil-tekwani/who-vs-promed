The report of possible cowpox in Brazilian cattle is fascinating, and
worthy of thorough virological work-up. Although there are several
reports of 'cowpox' outside of Europe and W. Asia in the pre-
smallpox eradication era, these were most likely caused by
escaped vaccinia (the smallpox vaccine), and cowpox virus is
generally believed to have a Eurasian geographic range. Certainly
its existence in the Americas would be unlikely -- and those
orthopoxviruses found in the Americas tend to be very different
from the old world orthopoxviruses when compared at the
molecular level, suggesting long term separation of lineages.
Furthermore, cowpox has wild rodents (although not house mice or,
long term, rats) as its reservoir hosts, making its introduction to
Brazil even more unlikely.
On the other hand, the description of systemic signs in humans do
not fit with the normal picture of pseudocowpox (paravaccinia), and
vaccinia virus should not be around any more. Bovine herpesvirus
should not be zoonotic.
So, as I said, fascinating.

The clinical picture of the so-called cowpox can be caused by
different viruses as stated by the authors. Given the location of the
skin lesions in both the cattle and the milkers, pseudocowpox virus
(genus _Parapoxvirus_, subfamily Chrodopoxvirinae, family
Poxviridae), bovine herpes virus 2 (Alphaherpesvirinae,
Herpesviridae), and cowpox virus (_Orthopoxvirus_,
Chordopoxvirinae, Poxviridae) come to mind as possible
etiological agents.
However, it would surprise me if the recent cases in cattle and
humans in Brazil are due to an infection with cowpox virus (CPXV).
This particular orthopoxvirus species is barely isolated from cows
any longer. To my knowledge there are only 2 CPXV strains
isolated from cows in the past two decades (one in the UK and one
in Germany). In addition, CPXV has never been described in the
New World, although there are other members of the orthopoxvirus
genus around, e.g.; racoon poxvirus and vole poxvirus.
To distinguish between either of the 3 viruses, electron microscopy
would be the fastest way to tell because of the unique shape of
each of them. There are a couple of other tests available to
confirm CPXV as the etiological diagnosis, the most easy of them
is to do histopathology and to look for eosinophilic inclusion bodies
in the cytoplasma. These A-type inclusion bodies together with
hemorrhagic pocks on the chorioallantoic membrane of
embryonated chicken eggs are the biological properties that define
the species.
Animal and human infections with any member of the genus
orthopoxvirus are notifiable in many countries. Since protection
against an infection with an orthopoxvirus in the human population
is rapidly declining after [smallpox vaccination campaigns have
been stopped in the late seventies, any "activity" of
orthopoxviruses in humans should be diagnosed properly and
reported accordingly.
