Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza In Hong Kong, Special
Administrative Region Of The People's Republic Of China
-----------------------------------------------
(Date of previous outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in
Hong Kong reported to the OIE: January 2005 [in a wild bird]).
Immediate notification report.
Information received on 20 Jan 2006 from the Director of the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), Hong Kong:
Report date: 20 Jan 2006.
Identification of agent: avian influenza virus subtype H5N1.
Date of start of the event: 10 Jan 2006.
Estimated date of 1st infection: 4-8 Jan 2006.
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory
Details of outbreak:
1st administrative division: New Territories
Type of epidemiological unit: NA*
Name of the location: Tai Po
Latitude: 22o 27' 00" N
Longitude: 114o 09' 29" E
Species: fau
Number of animals in the outbreak
susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
- / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
* NA: not applicable
Affected population: a single male adult Oriental magpie robin
(_Copsychus saularis_).
Diagnosis: the bird was found dead on 10 Jan 2006 and was submitted
for virological examination late that afternoon.
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: Tai Lung Veterinary
Laboratory, AFCD.
Samples examined: cloacal and tracheal swabs.
Diagnostic tests used:
- chicken embryo inoculation with hemagglutination inhibition testing
by type specific reference antisera from CVL Weybridge;
- viral genome detection by real-time RT-PCR(1) tests using H5
specific primer sets from SEPRL, Atlanta, Georgia, USA;
- N1 typing by conventional RT-PCR following procedures from
Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong (HKU).
Date: ...
Results: ...
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: The University of
Hong Kong (HKU)
Samples examined: ...
Diagnostic tests used: genetic sequencing of the hemagglutinin
cleavage site and other genetic characterization.
Date: see genetic analysis report, below.
Results: see genetic analysis report, below.
Source of agent / origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Other details/comments:
- _Copsychus saularis_ is distributed in the Indian subcontinent,
Southeast Asia, Indochina, the Philippines, the Andamans, Greater
Sundas and southern China south of the Yangtze River. This bird is a
common resident in Hong Kong. It inhabits a wide range of habitats,
such as gardens/parks, villages, secondary forests, open forests and
mangroves. Insects are the main diet of the bird.
- All poultry farms within 5 km of where the Oriental magpie robin
was found have been checked, and no unusual mortality or illness was
detected. An intensive surveillance system is in place on all poultry
farms and other locations.
- Local poultry farms are routinely under a constant monitoring and
surveillance program involving serological and virological testing
and have individual farm biosecurity plans, which include
bird-proofing of all sheds. All chicken farms are routinely
vaccinated with inactivated H5N2 vaccine, and each batch of chickens
has 60 unvaccinated individually identified sentinels, which are
monitored over the production life of the batch.
- Extensive virus culture and surveillance is conducted in wholesale
and retail poultry markets and in bird parks and wild bird
populations throughout Hong Kong. In 2005, over 9800 fecal or
cloacal/tracheal swabs from local poultry farms, 14 100 from
wholesale or retail live poultry markets, 2900 from waterfowl and
aviaries in recreational parks, 3000 from pet bird shops and markets
and 9000 from wild birds were tested in Hong Kong as part of the
avian influenza surveillance program. The only case of H5N1 infection
detected was the Chinese pond heron reported on 14 Jan 2005 (see
Disease Information, 18 [2], 18). In the past 3 months, over 1600
wild bird carcasses collected from various locations were tested, and
the only positive case was this one. There were no reports of unusual
mortality in wild birds. Ongoing territory-wide surveillance is continuing.
Genetic analysis report
Information received on 25 Jan 2006 from the Director of the
Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD), Hong Kong:
The virus was confirmed as a highly pathogenic H5N1 isolate by PCR(2)
and sequencing of the HA connecting peptide region. Molecular
analysis showed that the HA protein of A/MRb/HK/75/06 [H5N1] has the
multiple basic amino acids to satisfy the motif of a highly
pathogenic avian influenza virus for chickens, but there is a
deletion in the 2nd to last position of the connecting peptide (LRERRRK-R).
Phylogenetic analysis showed that A/MRb/HK/75/06 [H5N1] belongs to
H5N1 genotype V, which has previously been recorded in southern
China, Japan and South Korea. Genotype V differs from the dominant
genotype Z, which is widespread throughout Asia, in the source of the
PA gene(3). The H5-HA gene of this virus has high homology (98
percent) to the HA gene of A/Dk/Hunan/5806/03 [H5N1].
There are no changes from A/Gs/GD/1/96 at the receptor binding sites
of the hemagglutinin. The NA gene has the 20 amino acid deletion that
is characteristic of genotype Z H5N1 viruses. The M gene has Ser at
position 31 and has no other mutations that are known to confer
amantadine resistance. The NS1 gene has the 5 amino acid deletion
seen in genotype Z viruses and has Asp at position 92. The PB2 gene
has Glu at position 627.

[The isolation of a highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in
the oriental magpie robin, a small passerine bird (see
<http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/birds/Copsychus_saularis.htm> for
more information) highlights yet again another dimension of this
disease. I know we do not need to be reminded of how challenging
understanding all of the ramifications of this disease in humans,
birds and various mammals is, but these new isolations in backyard
songbirds highlight yet another wrinkle in the complex,
epidemiological web of this disease. - Mod.PC]
