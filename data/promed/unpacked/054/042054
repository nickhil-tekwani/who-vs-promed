Kenya family is the first victim of bioterrorism outside U.S
------------------------------------------------------------
Four members of a Kenyan family have tested positive for anthrax after
receiving a letter from the United States, making them the first victims of
bioterrorism outside the United States, Kenya's Public Health Minister Sam
Ongeri said Thursday. The family received a letter postmarked in the United
States containing a white powdery substance 3 days before the 11 Sep 2001
attacks on New York and Washington, Ongeri said in a press conference.
Two other letters, postmarked in Pakistan and addressed to the United
Nations center in Nairobi, are being examined for the presence of the
deadly bacteria by officials, the minister added.
The announcement was made the day after representatives from 30 African
countries met in Dakar, Senegal, and failed to sign an anti-terrorist
agreement that would help prevent the continent from becoming a stage for
attacks or serving as a base for extremist groups.

Health Minister Confirms Anthrax Case in Kenya
----------------------------------------------
Kenyan Health minister Sam Ongeri said on Thursday that a letter sent to an
unidentified Kenyan businessman in Nyeri, about 70 miles north of the
capital Nairobi, had tested positive for the anthrax bacteria. "On 17 Oct
2001 3 suspected cases (of anthrax) were reported to the ministry," Ongeri
told a news conference in the Kenyan capital Nairobi. "One of the samples
tested positive by stain and smear."
He said the letter was posted from Atlanta, United States, and passed via
Miami.
Two other suspect letters were undergoing tests in Kenya, he said, one of
which was delivered to the United Nations in Nairobi on Wednesday.

Kenya Confirms Anthrax Letter
-----------------------------
White powder in a package mailed from Atlanta to a Kenyan doctor has tested
positive for anthrax spores, health officials said Thursday, the first
proven case of tainted mail outside the United States since the 11 Sep 2001
attacks. The package was sent by a relative of the doctor, said Dr. Julius
Meme of the health ministry. However, when the
doctor asked the relative what the substance was, the relative said he knew
nothing about any powder, Meme said. The package was also damp. The package
had been mailed 8 Sep 2001 from Atlanta and was received in Kenya on 9 Oct
2001, Ongeri said. It was opened on 11 Oct 2001. The package contained
samples of cloth and was sent via Express Mail Service, said Meme.
Health Minister Sam Ongeri told reporters that the unidentified doctor, who
lives in Nairobi, and 4 family members "may have come into contact" with
the spores and were being tested, but they are "not in danger." The powder
was undergoing further tests at a government lab, he said.
White powder was found in 2 other letters -- one to an official with the
U.N. Environment Program in Nairobi and the other to a Kenyan businessman in
the central town of Nyeri, Ongeri said. Those letters were also being tested
at the state-run Kenya Medical Research Institute, he said.
The letter to the U.N. office was in a brown, tatty envelope bearing a
Pakistani postage stamp in the upper lefthand corner, said Torre Brevik, a
spokesman for the environmental program. It was addressed in blue ink to a
UNEP employee, whom he would not identify. In the upper righthand corner,
where the postage stamp should have been, the word "immaculate" was written
in blue ink. UNEP is headquartered in Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.
The Kenyan government set up a task force that included representatives from
the health ministry, the postal service and the Atlanta-based U.S. Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. It is to issue a report on Friday. "We
would like to ask all Kenyans not to panic, but to remain calm. The
government has the capacity and capability to deal with the situation,"
Ongeri said.
The anthrax attacks have caused jitters worldwide. There have been hundreds
of scares and hoaxes, but before the announcement in Kenya, no cases outside
the United States had tested positive.
In France; the U.S. Consulate in Berlin; in Greece where the health ministry
was closed Thursday; in Beijing government health workers disinfected people
who came into contact with suspicious substances enclosed in a letter sent
to an American firm, China's Foreign Ministry said Thursday.

Kenya finds anthrax letter
--------------------------
Many countries have been taking precautions. The Government in Kenya says it
has confirmed a case of anthrax exposure from a contaminated letter - the
first such case outside the United States. The Health Minister, Sam Ongeri,
said anthrax had been discovered in a letter sent from the United States.
He said the letter had been sent to an ordinary Kenyan citizen, and that 4
people had been exposed to the spores.
Atlanta postmark
Mr Ongeri said that the anthrax letter found in Nairobi had been posted in
the US city of Atlanta on 8 Sep 2001, and routed via Miami. The letter was
received in Nairobi on 9 Oct 2001 and opened on 11 Oct 2001. Mr Ongeri said
that the people exposed to the letter were "not in danger".
Two other suspect letters are also being tested for anthrax, including one
received by the United Nations Environment Programme in Nairobi on
Wednesday. That letter was posted in Pakistan, while the third letter,
addressed to a businessman in the town of Nyeri, appeared to have been
posted in Nairobi.

[I apologise for the repetition but it took some time for the accounts to
settle down into a consistent pattern. There seems to have been contact but
not infection. One may wonder why the package was "damp" after travelling
for a month. If this is bioterrorism and not a mere imitator, it is a
significant difference in strategy to target low profile individuals in
other countries. The true Atlanta poster must know the families concerned
and is probably known by them. - Mod.MHJ
