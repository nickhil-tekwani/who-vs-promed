Cameroon reports 1st case of bird flu
-------------------------------------------
Cameroon on Sunday [12 Mar 2006] became the 4th country in Africa to
report an outbreak of bird flu, after the disease was detected in
young chicks in the West African country's northernmost province.
"The 1st case of bird flu has been detected in the Far North
province," the government said in a statement read on state radio.
"The case was detected after laboratory tests conducted on dead
chicks in Maroua (in Far North province) were positive," it added.
The statement did not specify whether the outbreak was of the highly
pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza strain, which has already been
confirmed in domestic poultry flocks in Nigeria, Niger and Egypt.
Cameroon's Far North province borders to the west with Nigeria, where
Africa's 1st outbreak of H5N1 bird flu was confirmed on 8 Feb 2006.
[On the east, the affected province borders Chad; see map at

As the disease spreads in Africa, international experts are concerned
that the world's poorest continent, already saddled with HIV/AIDS and
malaria, is ill-equipped to combat this new health threat.
Suspected poultry outbreaks in Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia and Sierra
Leone are already under investigation.
Health officials are concerned that infection across Africa, where
millions live in close contact with poultry in their homes and
backyards, will increase the probability that the virus will mutate
to become transmissible between humans.

Bird flu virus reaches Batam
---------------------------------
Laboratory tests on blood samples from 4 dead chickens and one ailing
chicken in Batam have shown that they carried the bird-flu virus, a
local government official said here on Saturday [11 Mar 2006].
Jusak, an official of the local marine resources, fisheries and
agricultural service, said the discovery meant that the deadly
disease had already reached Batam, the country's oldest
industrialized zone.
He said that how the virus had come to Batam was still unknown but
that it was believed the source of the infection was wild birds.
The blood sample from a sick chicken in Kampung Tiban Koperasi in
Sekupang had also tested positive for the H5N1 virus.
In view of the discoveries, Jusak said his office had called on all
parties, particularly poultry farmers, to increase cleanliness at
their farms.
"Fortunately, until now, the virus has not claimed any human life
here. But we have to be alert to the danger," he said.

WHO admits to mislabeling Taiwan as bird flu area
-----------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization yesterday [10 Mar 2006] publicly
admitted they made a mistake in labeling Taiwan a bird flu area on
the disease outbreak map on their official website. They confirmed
there have been no cases of human or poultry avian influenza in
Taiwan.
Addressing reporters in Geneva yesterday [10 Mar 2006], Dr. Keiji
Fukuda, the acting director of WHO's Global Influenza Program,
reassured the world that Taiwan has not reported any cases of humans
contracting the virus. Dick Thompson, another WHO spokesman agreed
with Fukuda and confirmed that there are no reported incidents in
Taiwan.

[We are grateful to Mary Jeanne Buttrey for bringing the matter to
our attention.
The erroneous information on Taiwan being affected by H5N1 is the
result Taiwan appearing as a part of China on WHO's mapping system
(the WHO map was cited in ProMED-mail's commentary to [5] H5N1
influenza timeline: WHO update, in posting 20060310.0761). Following
a discovery of H5N1 in imported birds in the UK in October 2005, the
Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ),
Taipei, China, reiterated in an official notification to the OIE,
dated 26 Oct 2005 that "Taipei China is free from avian influenza"
and that "the 185 birds exported from Taipei, China to the United
Kingdom on 27 Sep 2005 were healthy and in compliance with the
quarantine requirement of the United Kingdom." This statement has not
been disputed. See
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_47.HTM#Sec18>.
A collection of general and regional avian influenza maps from
various websites, including interactive maps and maps which are
updated daily, is available at

[4] Release of domestic cats in infected areas
Date: Sun 12 Mar 2006
From: Julie Levy <LevyJ@mail.vetmed.ufl.edu>

Re: Avian influenza - worldwide (49): Asia, Europe
-----------------------------------------------
Regarding the moderator's comment that "release of owned cats should
be banned:"
Virtually all jurisdictions in the US already have laws against the
abandonment of pet cats and dogs. However, animal control infractions
rarely reach the level of civic priority to rate enforcement efforts.
Similarly, licensing and identification requirements for cats and
dogs are widespread, but usually have very low compliance.
A majority of US owned cats are allowed to roam outside, and it is
unlikely that stricter laws will change this very much. In addition,
there may be an equal number of un-owned feral cats residing in the
US. Volunteer groups are attempting to reduce feral cat populations
through sterilization campaigns, but the resources available for
these programs are scant compared to the resources devoted to
traditional animal control programs, which have failed to reduce
feral cat populations in the past. Increased support for effective
feral cat control programs that are acceptable to the public would be
expected to reduce public health concerns and environmental damage
and to improve cat welfare.
We have shown that feral cats are at increased risk for West Nile
Virus exposure compared to pet cats, and as such, feral cats may
represent an ideal sentinel species for other zoonotic diseases
endemic to wildlife. Large-scale feral cat sterilization programs are
in place throughout the country and may be well placed to provide
samples on a continuous basis for serosurveys of H5N1 activity.
Recent ProMED reports suggest that cats are only one of a variety of
species that are likely to be added to the list in the near future of
species susceptible to H5N1 infection. Their role in the transmission
of H5N1 remains to be determined [see commentary].
