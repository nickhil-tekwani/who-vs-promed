Deadly bird parasite taking toll on raptors
-------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of a deadly bird disease is taking a toll on several species of
raptors, especially Cooper's hawks and Harris' hawks.
The disease, trichomoniasis, is [caused by] a protozoan that usually
affects doves and pigeons, but is often transmitted to raptors that come in
contact with sick birds, said Elissa Ostergaard, urban wildlife specialist
with the Arizona Game and Fish Department.
The microscopic parasite has been known since falconry became popular in
the 13th century, Ostergaard said. It mainly affects the throats and mouths
of birds. The disease causes swelling or disfigurement that often results
in the bird being unable to eat. "There doesn't seem to be an epidemic yet,
but it is a significant outbreak, similar to one 10 years ago," Ostergaard
said.
Raptors sometimes recover from the disease but often starve to death or die
when the swelling becomes so pronounced they cannot breathe. This weekend,
a raptor blinded by the disease flew into the path of a truck and was
struck, said Jim Dwyer, a researcher at the University of Arizona School of
Renewable Natural Resources.
Bringing birds into contact with one another dramatically hastens the
spread of trichomoniasis, Ostergaard said. That is common in areas where
people feed birds or provide them with water. The parasite can live for
more than an hour on food and up to 10 hours in water, Ostergaard said.
Raptors contract the disease when they feed upon the ailing birds.
The disease is characterized by cheese-like or pus-like accumulations in
the throat, said Shananne Edwards, a veterinarian at the Arizona Small
Animal Clinic, which sees 2 or 3 cases of the infection in doves or pigeons
each week. "We only get 3 or 4 cases where raptors are involved in a year,"
she added. "When we treat them, we wear masks and gloves and
really protect ourselves during the treatment," Edwards said. "We consider
it as contagious as the plague."
That's why people feeding birds need to be cautious, Ostergaard said. Put
out only enough food for 5 or 10 minutes of feeding or enough water to last
less than a day. Once dry, the parasite generally dies.
Ostergaard said she knows many people won't listen to the advice because
they think they are doing a service to wildlife by providing food and
water. "And there are people who have been feeding doves for 30 years, and
you're never going to stop them," she said.
Besides the danger of spreading trichomoniasis, feeding birds attracts
rodents seeking dropped food, and the mice and pack rats attract snakes,
coyotes, and bobcats. "Rather than bird feeding, I call it bobcat feeding,
because they are attracted to the wildlife that comes for the food,"
Ostergaard said. "Wildlife is always looking for food, water or shelter."
Instead of feeding birds, she recommends planting native plants because
they attract birds, she said. That helps prevent trichomoniasis and other
easily contracted illnesses.
"Prevention is the best thing and that is done by keeping feeders and
watering devices really clean," she said. "Empty them out every day and
scrub them with a 10 percent chlorine bleach mixture. "Most people will
never see a dead dove and raptor, but if people don't change their behavior
we could have an epidemic," she said. "And that could be devastating."

[Trichomoniasis in Cooper's hawks from Arizona was described by Boal et al
. (1998) in J Wild Diseases 34(3):590-3. They demonstrated that prevalence
of _T. gallinae_ was significantly greater among urban nestlings (85
percent) than among ex-urban nestlings (9 percent), and postulated that the
patterns found were probably caused by 3 factors: doves are hosts for the
parasite, they are present in large numbers in Tucson, and they are the
primary prey of urban Cooper's hawks there. There is no risk of the
infection spreading to humans. - Mod.AS/EP]
