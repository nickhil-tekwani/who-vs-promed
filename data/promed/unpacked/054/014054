The South Korean government confirmed on Tuesday [7 Dec 2010] a bird
flu [avian influenza] outbreak in a southwestern region of the
country, a main winter habitat of migratory birds.

The agricultural ministry said the state veterinary service confirmed
that the bird flu virus was found in one of the blood samples sent
from Iksan, North Jeolla [Jeollabuk-do] Province.

The ministry conducted an emergency disinfection of the area around
the Mangyeong River, where the infected wild bird was found, and put
an area within a 10-km [6 mi] radius from the site of the outbreak
under intensive care.

There are about 219 chicken farms and 13 duck farms in the specially
designated area, according to government figures.

"This case of bird influenza was found in a wild bird, so the virus
may not have been spread to farm-raised poultry yet," a senior
ministry official said, requesting anonymity.

[South Korea's last HPAI H5N1 epizootic occurred between January and
May 2008, involving 33 outbreaks; see summary and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=6934>.

Since September 2008, a surveillance protocol has been operational in
all parent stock duck farms. Consequently, low-pathogenic avian
influenza (LPAI) strains have been discovered several times (October
2008, H5N2; December 2008, H5N2; December 2009, H7N2; December 2009,
H5N2; June-July 2010, H7N7; October 2010, H7N7; November 2010, H7N6).

South Korea maintains exemplary transparency and a meticulous, timely
reporting system regarding its AI situation. Details on the identity
of the affected bird and the pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus strain
are anticipated soon. - Mod.AS]
