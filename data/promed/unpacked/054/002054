"Increase Seen in Monkeypox Cases"
Science (08/22/97) Vol. 277, No. 5,329, P. 1027
According to the World Health Organization, the largest
outbreak of monkeypox in humans is continuing in Africa. Local
health workers recently reported 170 new cases of suspected
monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of Congo, formerly Zaire,
from March through May--the same Katako-Kombe region visited by
an WHO-organized team earlier this year. The WHO team reported
in February 92 cases of suspected monkeypox, alarming many medical
experts because 73 percent of those cases seemed to be
transmitted from human to human; an earlier study in the region
found 32 cases in five years, 70 percent of which were
transmitted animal to human.
Researchers say the cases may be
increasing because the smallpox vaccine, which is effective
against monkeypox, has not been used since scientists declared
the virus eradicated 20 years ago. Additionally, David Heymann
of the WHO suggests that some of the recent cases may actually be
chicken pox, which causes similar symptoms to monkeypox.
However, more studies are needed to determine why human-to-human
transmission is increasing, and Heymann says the WHO plans to
send another team to the region soon.
