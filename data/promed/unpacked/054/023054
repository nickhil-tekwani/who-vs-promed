Brazil: Measles outbreak in Bahia State
---------------------------------------------
Four additional measles cases may have been confirmed in Bahia State,
all of them in Filadelfia city. There are now 47 sick people in that
state. The Health Secretariat has said that there is a measles
epidemic ongoing and has recommended tourists to have their
immunization one week before traveling.
Last Saturday [20 Jan 2007], a regional vaccination campaign was
started. The main target population are male subjects between 12 and
39 years old, since most children and women have already been taken
care of. In Salvador, the state capital city, vaccination posts have
been established in regional bus stations, in the airport, and in the port.
Results of studies performed by FIOCruz Laboratory indicate that the
virus may have come from Canada, Europe, or Africa.

[The index case became sick on 23 Oct 2006, lab specimens were
collected on 18 Nov 2006 and positive confirmation was made. It was
reported by ProMED-PORT, our Portuguese language list, on 23 Nov
2006. Since then the outbreak has been slowly spreading in spite of
mass vaccination designed to stop it. There are many unvaccinated
children in Brazil, and the
index case may have contracted it from a foreign tourist.
Autochthonous transmission in Brazil was halted by vaccination in
2000. From 2001-2004 only 4 cases were recorded, all imported from
Europe & Japan. A small outbreak in 2005 was initiated by a surfer
returning infected from the Maldives -- see ProMED ref. below. - Mod.JW]
