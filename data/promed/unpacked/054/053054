Up to week 5 of 2006, the numbers of consultations for influenza-like illness
(ILI) or acute respiratory infection (ARI) have been low in all European
countries reporting to the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS)
<http://www.eiss.org>. Only slight increases of influenza activity have been
reported in recent weeks by France, the Netherlands, Norway and the United
Kingdom (1). Experience of previous epidemics suggests that clinical influenza
activity may still increase in the coming weeks (Figure 1 -- the original text
is illustrated by a figure analysing the timing of peak consultations for ILI
or ARI by week in the winter season for the 9 countries that have reported
data to EISS since 1996. These countries are England, Wales, Scotland, Spain,
Belgium, Portugal, France, the Netherlands and Germany.)
When compared with previous winters, especially those of 1997-1998 and 2000-
2001, it appears that the present consultation levels are not exceptionally
low.
Remarkably, the United Kingdom experienced only very mild influenza seasons
after the 2000-2001 winter, in contrast to the other countries analysed.
Since week 40 of 2005 (the start of the current surveillance period), 1345
influenza viruses have been detected, 937 (70 percent) being type B and 408
(30 percent) type A (of which 53 percent were subtype H1 and 47 percent
subtype H3). This distribution is remarkable. The last winter in which
influenza A/H1 and B viruses formed a sizable proportion of the influenza
virus detections was in 2000-2001. However, during the 2002-2003 winter, in
which influenza activity also started late, a similar distribution of
influenza A (although being of the H3 subtype) and B viruses was found in week
5 of 2003 (2), whereas later in that winter influenza A viruses dominated (3).
Of the 132 virus isolates which have been antigenically and/or genetically
characterised up to week 5 of 2006, 20 were A/New Caledonia/20/99 (H1N1)-like,
23 were A/California/7/2004 (H3N2)-like, 69 were B/Malaysia/2506/2004-like
(B/Victoria/2/87-lineage) and 20 were B/Jiangsu/10/2003-like
(B/Jiangsu/10/2003 is a B/Shanghai/361/2002-like virus from the
B/Yamagata/16/88-lineage and is currently used in the vaccine) (1). The A/H1
and A/H3 viruses were not antigenically distinguishable from the A virus
strains included in the vaccine, whereas 69 of the 89 B viruses were
antigenically distinguishable from the B virus strain included in the vaccine.
Also in the United States (US) and Canada there is little influenza activity
at present (4,5). However, the (sub)type distribution of the causative viruses
is different from that in Europe. In the US, 97 percent of virus detections
were influenza A and only 3 percent influenza B (n=4466). In Canada, influenza
A and B viruses were detected in similar proportions (51 percent A, 49 percent
B). The vast majority (>90 percent) of subtyped influenza A viruses in the US
and Canada have been A/H3. In the US and Canada, specimens are mainly
collected from patients visiting a hospital, whereas in Europe a substantial
proportion of specimens are collected by general practitioners (6.7). This
might partly explain the differences in the virus (sub)types detected. In
Canada 97 percent of the 87 characterised B viruses belonged to the
B/Victoria/2/87 lineage and the rest to the B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage,
comparable to Europe, where 78 percent of the characterized B viruses belonged
to the B/Victoria/2/87-lineage. In contrast, in the US only 27% of the 11
characterized B viruses belonged to the B/Victoria/2/87-lineage.
In conclusion, the low level of influenza activity in Europe during the 2005-
2006 winter is not exceptional when compared with historical data. Based on
observations during previous epidemics, Europe may still experience increased
influenza activity in the coming weeks, but the chances are decreasing with
time.
