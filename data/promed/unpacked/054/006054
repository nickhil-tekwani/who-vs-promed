Southern hemisphere flu vaccines: 5 of 11 were same as prior northern
hemishere vaccine
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In yesterday's ProMED-mail post titled 'Influenza vaccine 2009: S.
hemisphere,' archive number 20080922.2988, the Moderator commented
that: "In summary, perhaps unusually, the composition of the
influenza vaccines for use in the northern and southern hemispheres
in 2009 are identical.

On the contrary it is actually not so unusual. Since 1999, when the
World Health Organisation (WHO) began making recommendations for a
Southern Hemisphere vaccine, the Southern Hemisphere vaccine was the
same as the previous Northern Hemisphere season's vaccine in 5 out of
the 11 years:

1999
2002
2003
2007
2009

The Southern Hemisphere vaccine differed from the previous Northern
Hemisphere season's vaccine by:

0 component: 5 times (1999, 2002, 2003, 2007, 2009)
1 component: 4 times (2001, 2004, 2005, 2006)
2 components: 2 times (2000, 2008)
3 components: 0 times

The Northern Hemisphere vaccine differed from the previous Southern
Hemisphere season's vaccine by:

0 component: 5 times (1999-2000, 2000-2001,2001-2002, 2003-2004, 2008-2009)
1 component: 5 times (2002-2003, 2004-2005,2005-2006, 2006-2007, 2007-2008)
2 components: 0 times
3 components: 0 times

[My comment in the previous post was a guestimate and ProMED-mail is
indebted to Jody Lanard for providing this detailed record of vaccine
composition during the past 11 years. Dr. Lanard has compiled a
comprehensive chart of every season's recommended flu vaccine
components, detailing the changes from the previous season and/or
year. I recommend interested readers to request this informative
chart directly from Dr. Lanard.

It is noteworthy that overall there has been little diverge between
the vaccines recommended for use in the northern and southern
hemispheres, reflecting only a slow drift in the antigenic properties
of the seasonal influenza viruses affecting the human populations of
the northern and southern hemispheres. - Mod.CP]
