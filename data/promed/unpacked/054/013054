North Carolina: Horse in Seagrove Tests EEE virus-positive
----------------------------------------------------------
A horse in the Seagrove area tested positive for eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) virus, a mosquito-borne virus that is more deadly for
humans than the better-known West Nile virus.
State health officials say eastern equine encephalitis is a rare disease
that attacks the central nervous system, causing swelling of the brain and
spinal cord. There have been 73 confirmed cases in animals in 37 North
Carolina counties this year. There were only 3 confirmed cases in 2002.
No human cases have been reported in North Carolina. Most of the animals
infected with the disease have been horses. There have also been a few
infected emus, which are ostrich-like birds. Dogs and cats usually do not
get the virus.
Davidson is the only county bordering Randolph that has had a confirmed
case of the virus. But state health officials warned people who live in
other counties not to assume the disease isn't in their area. "That doesn't
mean that the disease has not been there," said Dr. Charles Kirkland, the
state Department of Agriculture's director of animal health programs in
livestock. "This means we haven't had a confirmed case reported to us. We
just get the tip of the iceberg."
Randolph County Health Director MiMi Cooper said eastern equine
encephalitis virus is similar to West Nile virus but is more likely to kill
humans and horses. [Although the viruses cause similar illnesses of
different severity, they are not closely related. Eastern equine
encephalitis virus belongs to the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family
_Togaviridae_, and West Nile virus belongs to the genus _Flavivirus _ of
the family _Flaviviridae_. - Mod.CP]. She said the case in Seagrove is the
first she's heard of in Randolph County. The horse was euthanized, Cooper
said.
Health officials say mosquitoes spread the disease from small animals such as
birds and rodents to horses and humans. Horses do not spread the disease to
people. There is a vaccine to protect horses, but not for humans. The state
Department of Agriculture's Web site says North Carolina averages about one
human case of EEE a year. About 50 percent of human cases are fatal, with
young children and the elderly most at risk. It can take people a few days to
2 weeks to develop EEE symptoms, which include the rapid onset of fever and
headache and can resemble the flu. Survivors may suffer from long-term
effects to the nervous system.

[Emus may actually be as sensitive or more sensitive to eastern equine
encephalitis than horses. However, the emu industry began declining several
years ago, and there are not as many of these birds in as many areas as
previously.
Horses need to be vaccinated prior to the onset of mosquito season. The
vaccine is given as series of 2 injections approximately 3 weeks apart.
Generally the Eastern equine encephalitis vaccine is found in combination
with Western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis vaccines. These may also be
found in combination with tetanus toxoid. Generally, there is only a yearly
booster thereafter.
Horse owners that are just now vaccinating for the first time should be aware
that the animal is not fully protected by the vaccine for 2-3 weeks after
vaccination. - Mod.TG]
