Malaria alert on Panama-Costa Rica border
-------------------------------
Panamanian Health Minister Fernando Gracia issued an alert in
the western province of Bocas del Toro because malaria is spreading due to
heavy rains there and in Costa Rica. A health official told EFE on Saturday
that Gracia issued the measure after some 300 malaria cases were reported.
Malaria is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito, which thrives in areas of
standing water.
The minister ordered spraying in the area and set aside $80 000 for that
purpose.
