For nearly 15 years, biologists around the world have been watching as millions of frogs succumb to an infectious fungus called chytrid. Now, a group of Wichita State University students has discovered evidence of the deadly chytrid fungus in the Wichita area. This is the 1st report of chytrid in Kansas.

The pathogenic fungus is found in all neighboring states and has caused the decline and extinction of amphibian species globally. Wichita State's findings are based on 2 years of undergraduate and graduate research as part of a field ecology class in WSU's Department of Biology.

"This research is a wonderful collaboration between graduate and undergraduate students," said Mary Liz Jameson, associate biology professor in charge of the class. "The discovery is a classic example of the role of WSU in science education in Kansas and our community, helping us to understand this epidemic."

Jameson said the research results fill a gap in the middle portion of the United States where the fungus has never been reported. The only other study conducted in Kansas was in 2007. It studied 5 frogs in Johnson County, none of which tested positive.

The next step, Jameson said, is for the students to publish their findings in the peer-reviewed scientific journal "Herpetological Review." And she hopes to spread word to the community as a whole. As with the white nose fungus -- which for years has been causing a severe decline in bats -- education on how to prevent spreading chytrid is key.

The research by the group of 10 students was conducted at WSU field stations near Wichita, Viola, and Waterloo. It involved catching frogs and identifying them, swabbing them in a sterile fashion, and recording water quality of the surrounding habitat. In addition, there's a molecular component of DNA extraction and amplification.

It has been a community effort, Jameson said, requiring the skills and participation of many students. It also builds on the aquatic toxicology research of WSU professor Karen Brown and students in her lab.

Graduate student Timothy Eberl, who conducted the DNA analyses this summer [2013] hopes the new research will be valuable for the future of the state's amphibian populations. "We are speaking of possible keystone species within the aquatic environments of this state, and the potential trickle-down effect may have a longer reach than even we realize."

Jameson said there are steps people can take to help prevent the spread of chytrid. Never move a frog from one lake or pond to another. Always clean wet or muddy boots and tires and fishing, camping, gardening or frog-survey equipment. Avoid touching frogs, and use disposable gloves, sample bags and sterile equipment.

[_B. dendrobatidis_ (chytrid fungus) is a singular fungal pathogen. It has a swimming zoospore as the infectious stage. It colonizes skin cells of adult amphibians and the mouthparts of tadpoles. Infection occurs when zoospores land on the skin or the mouthparts and encyst. Through mechanisms that are not fully understood, the pathogen moves from the surface of the skin to the stratum granulosum of the epidermis and matures in the stratum corneum. There, it enters healthy cells, grows in size, and develops into an urn-shaped zoosporangium in which the zoospores develop. As infected skin cells move toward the surface, the zoosporangium matures, the discharge papilla opens, and mature zoospores swim out. The mechanism by which this pathogen causes disease seems to be by interference with the ion transport functions of the skin, leading eventually to cardiac failure.

Worldwide amphibian decline has been related to epidemics caused by the chytrid fungus. One hypothesis to explain the global amphibian decline is that the chytrid fungus acts as a propagating pathogen that was taken out of Africa by wildlife trade of _Xenopus_ spp. However, evidence indicates that this fungus is not the single cause of the worldwide amphibian decline (it is not necessary nor sufficient to cause population declines). Prevalences to various pathogens (other than chytrid fungus) were greater in declining amphibian populations than in non-declining ones (an indication that pathogens are affecting amphibian populations), as it is also reported here.

It has been shown that global warming can degrade toads' condition and that frog declines caused by the chytrid fungus were preceded by periods of increasing stress (an indication that poor condition is implicated in population declines). In addition, it was found that the severity of the infection by chytrid depends on the vigour of the individual infected. Moreover, amphibians have also declined in areas where the fungus is absent, and the fungus is sometimes present for long periods of time without causing disease. Thus, an impoverished condition resulting from environmental changes may be triggering vicious circles (in which the chytrid fungus may be implicated) that are decimating amphibian populations. Fortunately, there is evidence that the worldwide amphibian decline has slowed down. - Mod.PMB
