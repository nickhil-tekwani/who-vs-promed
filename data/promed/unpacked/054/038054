The Northeast Texas Public Health District is awaiting confirmation from the Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) about another possible case of infant botulism in East Texas.

According to NET Health Public Information Officer Terrence Ates, notification of the official lab results can span 2 to 3 weeks. Right now, the department is considering this a preliminary case. Ates said if confirmed by the state, this would be the 5th case of infant botulism in East Texas.

In June [2019], 4 cases of infant botulism were confirmed across East Texas. Two cases in Troup, one in Mineola, and one in Tyler. According to a follow-up investigation by the Northeast Texas Public Health District, the cases were in no way linked to each other. Officials confirm this most recent preliminary case has been reported in the Lindale area.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bacteria that cause infant botulism can be found in dust and dirt, even after cleaning. Infants are more susceptible to complications because their digestive tracts are not developed enough to fight off the bacteria which then begins producing toxins.

Warning signs of infant botulism include constipation, decreased movement, poor feeding, and at times, a weak cry. Botulism is not contagious, according to the CDC.

[Five cases in a general area is unusual. With multiple cases of a rare disease in an area, there is suspicion of a common vehicle for transmission of the spores of this organism. We await more information about this cluster.

Initially, infant botulism was linked to feeding infants honey, but most cases are no longer linked to this vehicle. Spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ are ubiquitous in the environment, and many times a specific source is not discovered. It should be noted that even totally breastfed infants can develop this entity.

The following is extracted from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on infant botulism in New York City [ProMED-mail: Infant botulism - USA (New York City) 20030117.0144]:

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA; about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults. [This form has been also referred to as adult colonization botulism. - Mod.LL]. Intestinal botulism results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common source of exposure is not usually identified; apparent clusters are rare and often remain unexplained after investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common source of exposure was identified.

"Botulism should be suspected in previously healthy infants aged less than 12 months who are constipated and who exhibit weakness in sucking, swallowing, or crying; hypotonia [decreased muscle tone]; and progressive bulbar and extremity muscle weakness. About half of patients require mechanical ventilation during hospitalization. Lumbar puncture and brain imaging generally yield normal results but can help differentiate among other causes of flaccid weakness. When infant botulism is suspected, local and state health departments should be notified promptly to arrange diagnostic stool testing."

Botulism immune globulin (BIG-IV) is indicated in infants with clinically diagnosed infant botulism before diagnostic confirmation. The prompt use of this specific immunoglobulin leads to a significant decrease in both ICU and total hospital stay. Reviews regarding BIG-IV use and infant botulism can be found in the references below. - Mod.LL
