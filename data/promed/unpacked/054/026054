A BSE case in Brandwijk
------------------------
A case of BSE has been recorded in a 7-year-old cow on a farm in
Brandwijk (South Holland). This is the 42nd case of BSE in the
Netherlands since 1997, and the 14th case in 2002.

The cow, Tjerkje 254, born on 07 Jan 1995, was sent by the owner to
an emergency-slaughter facility on 20 Aug 2002. On 21 Aug she was
found positive for BSE by the rapid BSE-test. A subsequent laboratory
investigation has confirmed the initial diagnosis on 29 Aug 2002.

No disease symptoms have been observed in any of the other 103
bovines on the farm. Tjerkje 254 was born and reared on the same
farm, in Brandwijk. As customary, an investigation is being performed
into the feeding on the farm, with special attention to the
ingredients fed to the sick cow during her first months of life. All
cows on the farm have been destroyed. In addition, high-risk animals
on other farms, whose origin was the affected farm, are being traced
back and destroyed.

BSE risks persist in slaughterhouses
-------------------------------------
Abattoir staff are still failing to observe basic anti-BSE measures
16 years after the crisis started, a report by European commission
veterinary inspectors revealed yesterday.

Workers slaughtering sheep were seen cross-contaminating carcasses
going for food with potentially dangerous body parts most likely to
contain BSE if the disease has really crossed from cows to smaller
farm animals.

There has been no evidence outside the laboratory that this has
happened but the removal of risk materials is seen as a key
precautionary measure in preventing a repeat of the cattle industry
disaster considered the prime culprit for the deaths of 125 Britons
and the inevitably fatal illness of 12 others.

The government's meat hygiene service, responsible for monitoring
abattoir controls, has had to issue reminders to its veterinary
staff, who are meant to ensure rules are enforced in individual
plants.

The report is embarrassing since the failure to police similar
measures in cattle slaughter during the early 1990s, before a
probable link between BSE and the human deaths was established in
1996, came back to haunt the then Tory government.

The inspectors, who visited Britain at the end of May, saw only 2
sheep slaughterhouses, and in both workers responsible for removing
spinal cords, potentially risky body parts, also touched the
carcasses without washing hands in between.

The Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)
last night accepted there was no room for complacency on abattoir
controls, but added: "Results of enforcement visits show levels of
compliance across Great Britain remain extremely high."

Japan: a year after/BSE blues
-----------------------------
In the year since mad cow disease was first discovered in Japan, the
government has spent enormous sums of taxpayers' money to win back
the public's trust in the meat industry. But part of the plan was
like putting a fox in charge of hen-house security. Greedy companies
suddenly found blank checks dangling in front of their noses, leading
to scandals involving mislabeled meat.

And when the mysterious nature of mad cow disease is thrown into the
mix, it is little wonder the traditionally finicky Japanese public
still harbors doubts about the safety of beef. "Once a problem
surfaces, people tend to become worried about this and that. Behind
such a mentality is probably the sense of public unease since the end
of the 20th century about science and technology," said Tatsuhiro
Kamisato, an expert on science history at the Tokyo-based Research
Institute of Science and Technology for Society. Kamisato said public
concerns are exacerbated by the "black boxes" in which food is
processed. He said consumers have no idea what happens to food before
it reaches the dinner plate.

After Japan's first case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE),
or mad cow disease, surfaced on 10 Sep last year, Tokyo spent 151
billion yen (1.22 billion USD) for a variety of BSE-related programs
and subsidies.

In contrast, Britain, which has had as many as 180 000 BSE cases so
far, used the equivalent of around 70 billion yen in 2000 to dispose
of all cattle aged 30 months or older and remove risky portions such
as brains and spinal cords from the meat-processing production.

Japan has confirmed 5 cases of BSE, while in Britain about 1000
infected cattle are still discovered annually.

But Japan's enormous funding has backfired in some ways. Major
companies Snow Brand Foods Co. and Japan Meat Packers Inc. disguised
imported meat as domestic to make it eligible for the
government-funded buyback program intended to help businesses hit by
the BSE scare. Instead of helping to restore consumer confidence, the
companies tried illegally take a piece of the 26.3 billion yen (213.6
million USD) earmarked for the buyback program.

Furthermore, the government's enormous expenditures have not produced
the desired results from a scientific standpoint. Testing of all dead
cattle, considered indispensable in determining how BSE is spread,
has yet to start.

In Japan, 70 000 cattle die each year of natural causes or illnesses.
The government said it will test all the dead animals but has so far
examined only 700 in sampling tests that began in April 2001, months
before the first BSE case was discovered. Meanwhile, the European
Union, which has tested all dead cattle aged 2 years or older since
July 2001, found 30 times more BSE infections among dead cattle than
in healthy animals.

Japan still has no idea how BSE, once considered a European problem,
infected Japanese cattle. Cattle feed called meat-and-bone-meal
(MBM), made from internal organs, bones, and scrap meat of
slaughtered cows, is widely blamed for the spread of the disease. But
the government does not know how and when the tainted MBM entered
Japan. About the only thing known so far is that a risky batch of MBM
was imported around 1990, before the British government restricted
exports of the product.

Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry officials have found
that MBM production procedures in Italy before June 1998 were
insufficient and could have led to the spread of the disease in
Japan. They have also raised suspicions over Netherlands-produced
animal fat used in substitute milk, which was later fed to Japanese
cattle. But no substantial link has been confirmed. Experts believe
the spread of BSE is part of a cycle in which infected cattle are
processed into MBM. Cattle fed this MBM become infected with the
disease. If these new cattle are turned into MBM, the cycle starts
over.

The first infected Japanese cow was in either the second or third
turn of the cycle, the experts say. But they still have no clear
answers on how far the infection has spread. As of 31 Aug 2002, 4 of
1 057 811 slaughtered Japanese cattle were found to have been
infected since all-out testing started 18 Oct 2001. The Health, Labor
and Welfare Ministry, which is in charge of the procedure, plans to
test all cattle for human consumption. The ministry will request 4
billion yen (32.5 million USD) for the tests in the fiscal 2003
budget.

The ministry plans to have prefectural facilities carry the bulk of
the testing load, since only 4 institutions, such as the National
Institute of Infectious Disease, are equipped to conduct detailed
examinations of suspicious cases. Inspectors from 17 prefectural
governments have been trained for such testing, prompting one
ministry official to say the program "is now on track."

But Kazuya Yamanouchi, an expert on infectious diseases and a
professor emeritus at the University of Tokyo, said: "There is no
scientific proof that you need to test cattle aged 2 years or
younger, because BSE cannot be detected in young animals. The all-out
testing should be reviewed with the public's approval. We still have
no idea how the infection has been transmitted, and testing of all
dead cattle is indispensable for studying the path of infection.
Also, we cannot deny that the current situation is the result of a
repeated cycle of BSE that entered Japan. We need to do an
epidemiological study on this."

Although Japan is the only Asian country where BSE has been
confirmed, mad cow disease appears to be spreading globally. The
World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) said new cases of BSE have
been reported in Israel and Poland this year. As of Aug 2002, mad cow
disease had infected cattle in 22 countries.

Concerns in Asia are mounting because only a few nations are capable
of conducting their own tests on BSE, according to Yoshihiro Ozawa,
special adviser to the OIE. He pointed out that the EU has found a
higher rate of infection among sick and dead cattle than in healthy
ones. The same is likely to occur in Japan after the government gets
around to testing, he said.

"Japan could very well find around 13 BSE cases among dead and sick
cattle. Given the fact that ranchers are holding back shipments of
old cattle, it's not unnatural to think that the number could be
around 20," Ozawa said. "We need to have an idea as soon as possible
of how the BSE-infected cattle are dispersed around Japan. The longer
we put it off, the longer it will take us to get rid of the BSE
problem."

Israel: BSE testing according to source and age groups
------------------------------------------------------
The Israeli veterinary services publish on a weekly basis the results
of the applied active BSE testing of fallen cattle. Since 1 Jul 2002,
all slaughtered cattle, over 30 months, have been added to the
testing scheme. The weekly report is signed by the Head, Department
of Pathology, KVI.

The following data are derived from the last weekly report,
presenting the accumulated numbers of tested cattle according to age
groups (in years), for the period 1 Jan - 11 Sep 2002:

1. Fallen cattle received at the central incineration facility,
Western Galilee:
2-3 / 3-4 / 4-5 / 5+/ total
30 / 75 / 68 / 208 / 381

2. Slaughtered cattle in abattoirs (from 1 Jul 2002 - including all
cattle over 30 months):
2-3 / 3-4 / 4-5 / 5+ / n.a. / total
78 / 291 / 567 / 1500 / 176 / 2612

3. Cattle with CNS symptoms, sent to the department of pathology in
KVI: total 28.

Grand total since 1 Jan 2002: 3021.

The national Israeli herd includes approx. 110 000 multiparous dairy cattle.

[The import to Israel of mammal MBMs from the UK was banned in 1988,
and from all countries since 1990. Since 1996, rendering of mammal
material was stopped altogether, and treatment of cadavers and
slaughterhouse waste was subsequently performed by burial. In 2001, a
central incineration facility became operational, currently receiving
most fallen stock and animal waste. Feeding of MBMs from mammal
origin to all food animals (mammals, avians, fish) was banned in
1996. Since July 2001, the feeding of poultry and fish meals to
mammalian food-animals has been banned as well.

Laboratory (passive) surveillance for BSE was initiated in 1992 by
histopathological examinations, performed in bovine brains of CNS
suspects at the KVI. Active surveillance was initiated in 1994; in
1997, immunochemistry was added to the lab arsenal. Since Jan 2001,
an intensified surveillance scheme has become operational, covering
fallen stock in addition to CNS suspects, while the rapid
Prionic-check BSE became the standard technique; histochemistry is
applied in inconclusive cases.

A case of BSE in a dairy cow, born in 1992, was diagnosed in June
2002. - Mod AS].

BSE: Result of the Scientific Steering Committee
------------------------------------------------
At its meeting of 12-13 Sep 2002, the Scientific Steering Committee
(SSC) examined the most recent data on the safety with regard of BSE,
of sheep casings and concluded that there is no additional or new
evidence justifying the possible inclusion of sheep casings in the
list of specified risk materials.

Until now the SSC postponed its conclusions regarding sheep casings
until further data and risk assessments would have become available.
Recently the SSC received three additional analyses on the risk of
exposure to the BSE agent through the use of natural sausage casings.
These were discussed by the SSC at its meeting of 12-13 September.
From the SSC's discussions it can be concluded that there is
currently no reason to include sheep casings in the list of specified
risk materials as long as there is no evidence that BSE is present in
small ruminants under field conditions and there are no indications
pointing at an increased likelihood of such being the case. The SSC
nevertheless confirmed that, should the presence of BSE in sheep
become probable or proven, the whole approach towards SRMs in small
ruminants should be revised. The possible additional inclusion in the
list of SRMs of intestines, lymph nodes, blood and peripheral nerves
should then be considered unless the presence of BSE infectivity can
be excluded on the basis of genotype, age, TSE test results, flocks
certification and/or geographical origin.

The SSC further adopted 3 opinions on the geographical BSE risk of
Israel, Malta and Slovenia. They are all considered to represent a
"Level III risk", meaning that the presence of one or more cattle
clinically or pre-clinically infected with the BSE agent is likely
but not confirmed, or confirmed at a lower level.

The Committee considers that recent research results on the
transmission of BSE infectivity by blood transfusion from
experimentally infected to a healthy sheep strengthens the
conclusions and recommendations put forward in earlier opinions on
the safety of human and ruminant blood, but does not call for a
revision of these opinions. These opinions contain recommendations
with respect to the safe use of human blood and the recycling or
disposal of ruminant blood.

The above opinions and the corresponding reports on which they are
based will be published shortly on DG Sanco's Internet page
http://europa.eu.int/comm/food/fs/sc/ssc/outcome_en.html.

Feeding practices in the German BSE inquiry; An oral presentation.

Evaluation of feeding practices in Bavarian BSE herds; the presented
data, based upon investigations of 82 confirmed BSE cases, were
obtained from 2 sources:
1. epidemiological questionnaire answered by the farmer;
2. copies of money transfer receipts of feedingstuff purchases.

Results:
1.
Q: Was Calf Milk Replacer (CMR) used? (Information from 79 cases).
A: Yes - 69 percent; No - 4 percent; No information available (NIA) -
27 percent.

2.
Q: Was CMR purchased? (Documentation from 82 cases).
A: Yes - 75 percent; No - 2 percent; No documentation available (NDA)
- 23 percent.

3.
Q: Did calves receive pelleted feed? (Information from 79 cases).
A: Yes - 58 percent; No - 22 percent; NIA - 20 percent.

4.
Q: Have Calf starter pellets been purchased? (Documentation from 82 cases).
A: Yes - 51 percent; No - 26 percent; NDA - 23 percent.

5.
Q: What combinations of CMR and commercial feeds (CF) for calves were
used? (Information from 79 cases).
A: CMR and CF - 48 percent; CMR, no CF - 19 percent; CF, no CMR - 3
percent; neither - 1 percent; NIA - 29 percent.

6.
Q: Did calves, which received exclusively CMR, get additional mineral
supplements? (Information from 20 cases . See 19 percent "CNR - no
CF" in Answer 5 above).
A: Yes - 20 percent; No - 40 percent; Unknown - 40 percent.

7.
Q: Did farms, where calves received exclusively CMR, buy feed for
other species? (Documentation from 20 cases - see 19 percent "CNR -
no CF" in Answer 5 above).
A: Yes - 50 percent; No - 50 percent.

Concluding remarks:
Open questions - Is there another route of (oral) infection than
meat&bone meal?
or
Is the assumed incubation period overestimated?

[The results of the Bavarian field investigation, while inconclusive,
do not exclude CMRs as a possible infection source (see previous postings).
It is extremely difficult to sort out facts and activities from several
years ago not recorded at the time, based on a rather limited number of
available cases. Any details on continued surveillance projects and similar investigations in other BSE-affected countries would increase the number of
analyzed cases and consequently the significance of the results. - Mod AS].
