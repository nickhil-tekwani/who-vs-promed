1st Report of tomato apical stunt viroid in tomato in Tunisia.
-----------------------------------------------
J. Th. J. Verhoeven, C. C. C. Jansen, and J. W. Roenhorst, Plant Protection
Service, Unit Virology, P.O. Box 9102, 6700 HC Wageningen, the Netherlands.
Plant Dis. 90:528, 2006; published on-line as DOI: 10.1094/PD-90-0528A.
Accepted for publication 22 Jan 2006.
In May 2005, the Plant Protection Service in the Netherlands received 2
tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) plant specimens for diagnosis from a
protected crop production facility of 2.5 ha near Kebili in Tunisia. Growth
of the plants was reduced, and leaves were chlorotic and brittle. Ripening
of the fruits was delayed, and their storage life was reduced from 3 weeks
to one week. The grower reported that initially only 5 percent of plants
showed symptoms; however, the number of symptomatic plants increased
quickly to 100 percent as a result of increasing temperatures in the
production facility. Test plant species _Chenopodium quinoa_, _Datura
stramonium_, _Nicotiana glutinosa_, _N. hesperis-67A_, _N.
occidentalis-P1_, and _L. esculentum_ "Money-maker" were mechanically
inoculated with sap from the affected plants. Symptoms including chlorosis
and stunting were observed only on _L. esculentum_. Reverse
transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with universal pospiviroid
primers Pospi1-RE/FW (2) yielded amplicons of the expected size (196 bp)
for each of the 2 samples. One of these amplicons was sequenced and showed
the highest identity to the 4 isolates of Tomato apical stunt viroid
(TASVd) in the NCBI GenBank. Subsequently, the complete sequence of the
Tunisian isolate (GenBank Accession No. DQ144506) was determined by
sequencing the amplicon obtained after RT-PCR using primers developed for
the detection of Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) (1). The isolate consisted
of 363 nucleotides and showed the highest sequence identity (96.7 percent)
to tomato isolates of TASVd from Indonesia and Israel (GenBank Accession
Nos. X06390 and AY062121, respectively), 92.6 percent to a tomato isolate
from the Ivory Coast (GenBank Accession No. K00818), and 87.7 percent to an
isolate from Solanum pseudocapsicum (GenBank Accession No. X95293). The
next highest sequence identity was 81.5 percent to an isolate of CEVd
(GenBank Accession No. X53716). On the basis of these results, the viroid
was identified as TASVd. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of TASVd
in Tunisia.

[The vegetable crop plant tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_) develops
symptoms of the disease apical stunt when infected with tomato apical stunt
viroid (family: _Pospiviroidae_, genus: _Pospiviroid_, TASVd). This report
is the 1st for TASVd in Tunisia and is from tests done on tomato samples
collected from protected facilities (greenhouses/screenhouses?) in May
2005. The most recent post in ProMED-mail (20030910.2273) is a 1st report
in Israel posted in 2003 for samples collected in 1999/2000. Earlier
reports of TASVd (1980's) are from Indonesia and Ivory Coast. The RNA
sequence of the Tunisian, Israeli and Indonesian strains are very similar.
Affected tomato plants in Israel showed shortened internodes (bushy
appearance), leaf deformation and yellowing, reduced fruit size, and pale
red discoloration of fruit. Up to 100 percent disease incidence could be
observed at single sites with heavy yield losses. The present article also
noted 100 percent disease incidence once temperatures were high, which is a
characteristic of several diseases caused by viroids. TASVd can be
transmitted from infected to healthy tomato plants by grafting or
mechanical inoculation (in experimental conditions). No data is available
on pollen or seed transmission, though some viroids are known to be
transmitted by these means. Introduction on transplants is a strong
possibility. Control of viroids is difficult in practice, so it would be
desirable to avoid any further spread of a potentially serious disease of
tomatoes. This new report from Tunisia acts as a warning to other
countries. Other viroids that have been detected in Tunisia are noted in
the archive below.
