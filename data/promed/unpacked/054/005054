Regarding the recent mention of TYMV occurrence in Brazil, there's no
report indicating the unequivocal presence of this virus in Brazil. Several
tomato-infecting geminiviruses have been reported in Brazil in recent
years, and at least two of them, from Minas Gerais state, have been
characterized at Univ. Fed. de Vicosa. These are new viruses, only
distantly related to TGMV and BGMV-Br. These viruses were named Tomato mild
chlorosis virus (TMCV) and Tomato rugose mosaic virus (TRMV). The two
manuscripts describing these viruses are in preparation. TGMV was reported
in the state of Rio de Janeiro in 1998, the first report of this virus
since the original report from 1975. All other species reported are,
apparently, new viruses, but further characterization remains to be carried
out. Several geminiviruses from weed plants such as _Sida rhombifolia_ have
also been characterized, work carried out at the laboratory of Dr.
Elizabeth Fontes, also at UFV. It is suspected that these plants act as
natural reservoirs of geminiviruses which are transmitted to tomatoes by
the new species of whitefly, _Bemisia argentifolii_, which, contrary to _B.
tabaci_, easily colonizes tomatoes.
We are currently analyzing the sequences of the Sida and tomato viruses,
looking for similarities and evidences of recombination among these viruses.
