Stew downs 50 in North Cotabato
-------------------------------------
Dozens of people were hospitalized for severe diarrhea and difficulty in
breathing after feasting on a pork stew cooked with cassava starch in the
southern Philippines, officials said. Most of the victims were teachers and
parents who attended a school meeting in the village of Alimbayong in
Magpet town in North Cotabato province on Fri 9 Sep 2005, the town mayor,
Efren Pinol, said.
Pinol said as many as 50 people were downed from the stew. "At least 15 of
the victims were seriously poisoned, but health experts are still
investigating what triggered the mass poisoning," he said on Sat 10 Sep 2005.
It was not immediately known whether the food was spoiled or contaminated
with poison, but health investigators are also looking into the cassava
starch used in the stew, he said. The cassava root is widely consumed in
Southeast Asia and other parts of the world, but it can also be poisonous
if not completely peeled or thoroughly cooked.
Early in 2005, at least 25 pupils in Mabini, Bohol died in different
hospitals hours after suffering from food poisoning. All the victims ate
cassava fritters and other snacks made from the root crop and immediately
suffered from stomach pains, nausea and vomiting. Many were dead by the
time they were brought to the hospital. Investigation later showed that
pesticide from the root crop caused the poisoning of the schoolchildren.

[Cassava (_Manihot esculenta_, Crantz) is a root crop widely consumed in
Africa and South America. Although it originated in Brazil (where it is
called manioc), it was brought to Africa by Portuguese colonists, and it is
now an important crop there and in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. It is the
principal source of nutrition for about 500 million people. Its leaves are
edible, but the prize is its starchy root, rich in protein, minerals, and
vitamins A, B, and C.
Cassava is used in a vast variety of cakes, snacks, and desserts and grows
wild in many places, being tough and drought-resistant. In a country where
hunger is now a reality for many poor households, cassava is among those
food crops that can make the crucial difference between starvation and
survival. The cassava plant is the world's 3rd most important crop. Cassava
enters the North American diet also, as it is made into tapioca.
Surprisingly, for an important edible plant, cassava is quite poisonous
without proper preparation. The toxin in cassava is called linamarin. When
eaten raw or inadequately prepared, it is converted to cyanide. Even 2
cassava roots contain a fatal dose of poison. While the bitter variety
(white cassava) has larger concentrations of cyanide than the sweet variety
(yellow cassava), the sweet cassava is not without risk.
To prepare cassava, it is peeled and grated and soaked in warm water for
several days. This allows the cassava's own natural enzyme (linamarase) to
convert the cyanogen linamarin to sugar and cyanide gas, and the volatile
gas disperses, usually harmlessly. However, women -- who are usually
charged with processing the plant -- can be sickened by inhaling cyanide
gas. What remains after processing can be boiled and eaten, or more
usually, dried and ground.
Given that cassava starch was used, it is likely that the outbreak is not
related to cyanide but rather to something else in the stew, either an
ingredient or a contaminant. - Mod.LL]
