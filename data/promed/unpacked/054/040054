A 2013 hepatitis outbreak that was linked to a fat-burning supplement manufactured by USPlabs LLC may have affected nearly 100 people in more than a dozen states. The CDC reported 97 cases and a death in 16 states including Hawaii that met its case definition, said Bernadette Burden, a CDC spokesperson. The figure is up from 56 cases reported in early November 2013.

CDC does not explicitly reference consumption of OxyElite Pro in its definition of a "case." The health agency previously defined a case "as acute hepatitis of unknown etiology occurring on or after 1 Apr 2013, in a person who had consumed a weight-loss or muscle-building dietary supplement within the previous 60 days" and met certain other requirements. Dallas [Texas]-based USPlabs did not respond to a request for comment on the current number of cases under investigation.

Roughly half the cases are in Hawaii, where local officials in 2013 reported a death and the need for 2 liver transplants. David Johnston, ELC epidemiologist with the Hawaii Department of Health's Disease Outbreak Control Division, said the agency continues to investigate the outbreak. A total of 44 individuals have reported using OxyElite Pro and met the agency's definition, he said. Of those individuals, 15 were hospitalized, Johnston said.

USPlabs in 2013 defended the safety of an ingredient (aegeline) in OxyElite Pro in a letter to FDA [Food and Drug Administration], citing tests and clinical data on the substance. Still, the company agreed to reformulate the supplement by removing aegeline, which FDA declared was not proven to be safe, and destroy the remaining inventory of aegeline-containing OxyElite Pro. FDA indicated in 2013 that the destroyed supplements were worth USD 22 million.

USPlabs expressed the belief that counterfeit versions of its OxyElite Pro were marketed in the USA. Arthur Whitmore, an FDA spokesperson, said the agency has not confirmed any products were counterfeit. FDA and Hawaii officials previously noted victims of the outbreak were not predisposed to liver disease, increasing the likelihood that OxyElilte Pro was responsible for the illnesses. The CDC also excluded certain individuals from its case definition, including those people who suffered chronic alcohol use, preexisting autoimmune hepatitis, and chronic liver diseases, such as hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease.

[The suspected ingredient in the dietary supplement OxyElite Pro, aegeline or N-[2-hydroxy-2(4-methoxyphenyl) ethyl]-3-phenyl-2-propenamide, is a synthetic version of an alkaloid that exists in natural form and is isolated from _Aegle marmelos_ Correa (Bael tree), which grows in Indonesia and other parts of Asia.

The United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) states: "We do not have the authority to evaluate and approve dietary supplements before they are sold to consumers. However, in this case we were able to invoke new enforcement authorities provided by FSMA to remove them from the market".... "Certain OxyElite Pro products and a 2nd product, VERSA-1, contain a new dietary ingredient that has not been shown to be safe for use by consumers. This ingredient, aegeline, is a synthetic version of an alkaloid that exists, in natural form, in a tree that grows in parts of Asia."

FSMA is the Food Safety Modernization Act. It aims to ensure the US food supply is safe by shifting the focus from responding to contamination to preventing it. The act provided powers such as the one above to the FDA, where it previously lacked them.

For a detailed description of studies on the earlier cases reported by the state of Hawaii and a description of the product, see prior ProMED-mail post, Dietary supplement, hepatic toxicity - USA: (HI) recall 20131009.1991563. In this earlier report, cases had been described in Hawaii and the product had been recalled in the state of Hawaii. At that time, state health departments were requested to begin active surveillance for additional cases. This active surveillance has led to identifying more than double the number of cases of toxic hepatitis in 16 states in the USA, all associated with use of these products. The use of these unregulated, over the counter dietary supplements continues to demonstrate the hazards of these products. The medical literature is sparse on studies on the efficacy of this product, yet it was freely available for purchase with unsubstantiated claims of aiding weight loss and strength building.
