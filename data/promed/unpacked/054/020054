Hepatitis E in Sudan - WHO update 2
-----------------------------------
>From 22 May - 27 Aug 2004, a total of 3753 cases -- and 55 deaths --
of suspected hepatitis E were reported from health clinics in the
Greater Darfur region through the early warning alert and response
system (EWARN).
West Darfur remains the most affected area, reporting 73 percent of
the total reported cases. There is a slight decrease in the total
number of cases reported from South and West Darfur, while cases in
North Darfur have increased slightly. The preliminary phase of field
investigations conducted by Epicentre and EPIET (European Programme
for Intervention Epidemiology Training) to assess the epidemiology of
hepatitis E, and to focus on the most appropriate prevention and
control measures, has been completed.
UNICEF has continued to work with federal and state ministries of
health, and with non-governmental organizations, to increase the
quality and quantity of the water supply. In West Darfur, Concern
Worldwide International has established public health teams and
completed the construction of 1000 latrines in Mornei. In the
accessible part of South Darfur, WHO has worked closely with the
Health and Hygiene Working Group in the area to develop strategies
for delivering consistent health messages for community health
education in the IDP camps for internally displaced people,
particularly targeting pregnant women and other high risk groups.
Despite these efforts, existing resources remain insufficient to
cover the basic water and sanitation needs of the displaced
populations in Darfur. Additional efforts are still needed to improve
access to safe, clean water and to provide better sanitation in the
camps in order to stop the spread, and reduce the number, of new
infections.
