[This is already the 2nd suspected anthrax case in the Jalal-Abad
region of Kyrgyzstan this year (2006). In June 2006, 3 patients with
suspected anthrax have been hospitalized in the Bazarkorgon district
hospital of the same region. However, the final results of laboratory
investigations have not appeared. - Mod.NP]
[Eastern Jalal-Abad is severely afflicted with enzootic anthrax.
Anthrax in Kyrgyzstan is either in this eastern part of the western
(not southern) oblast (province) of Jalal-Abad or in the provinces
along its northern border with Kazakhstan. Further details have been
requested from Bishkek. - Mod.MHJ]
