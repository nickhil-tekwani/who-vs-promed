Clues emerge in Clearfield bird deaths

CLEARFIELD -- Utah Division of Wildlife Resources officials now know what caused hundreds of birds to die in Clearfield a week before Christmas; however, there are still several unanswered questions.

Phil Douglass, the DWR conservation outreach manager for Northern Utah, said the toxicology results -- received Wednesday, from birds sent to a lab in Logan -- show the birds died after being exposed to Starlicide, a poison used primarily for starling population control.

"The thing that's tricky about the situation is there are 2 formulas of this Starlicide. One is commercial grade (used by the government) and the other is public grade, and there is no way of determining what grade it was," Douglass said. "So we know what it was, we just don't know where it came from."

Starlicide is a trade name for a chemical available to the public that is chemically similar to DRC-1339 -- a chemical salt -- used by Wildlife Services. The DRC-1339 is stronger than the Starlicide made available to the public in some states. Starlicide is not available to the pubic in Utah. Douglass said Starlicide takes effect 24 hours after being administered.

"The one good thing about it is it's a relatively safe chemical," said Leslie McFarlane, DWR's wildlife disease program coordinator. "When a bird consumes (the Starlicide), it metabolizes fully in the bird's stomach. So if a dog eats the dead carcass, it won't have any effect on the dog."

Who administered the poison is still a mystery.

Clearfield officials cleaned up approximately 400 dead European starlings after the birds were discovered 18 December 2011 in Kiwanis Park, 300 N. Vine St. While DWR investigated the deaths, no one took responsibility for poisoning the birds.

Mike Linnell, federal program director at Animal and Wildlife Damage Prevention Services, said his agency did not treat any birds in Clearfield. Starlicide is not licensed for public use in Utah. However, there are ways for the public to obtain the chemical in other states in which the chemical is registered.

DWR officials can only speculate on whether someone bought the Starlicide out of state and then used it near Clearfield.

Douglass said, "That is just a possibility, but there is no way to substantiate that."

Adding to the mystery are 40 more dead European starlings that were found in Clinton on Wednesday. Douglass said these dead birds are exhibiting different signs than the ones found in Clearfield on 18 December 2011.

"These (birds) had blood around their eyes and mouth," Douglass said. "We recommend that people don't handle them. And if they do, they should wear gloves and double-bag the carcasses and keep pets and children away."

DWR officials sent a few of those dead birds to the lab in Logan for a toxicology report. Because the people behind the bird deaths are unknown, DWR officials are concerned for other wildlife and public safety.

"While the starlings can overpopulate, and reductions are not a bad thing for starlings, what's causing that is a concern and we're trying to find that out," Douglass said.

[The EPA registration fact sheet indicates that Starlicide (3-chloro-p-toluidine hydrochloride) is an avicide used to control ravens, starlings [especially European starlings (_Sturnus vulgaris_ Linnaeus), [American] crows (_Corvus brachyrhynchos_), pigeons (_Columba livia_), [presumably this is the brown headed]cowbirds (_Molothrus ater_), grackles (_Quiscalus quiscula_), [American] magpies (_Pica hudsonia_), and certain gull species. Use sites vary by species but include livestock and poultry feedlots, building and fenced noncrop areas, Federal and State wildlife refuges and protected areas, gull colonies in coastal areas, and bird staging areas and roosting sites. While grain consuming birds are regarded as more susceptible, eagles are not susceptible.

Starlicide is formulated as a 98 percent powder to be applied to various baits, and as a 0.1 percent ready-to-use product. It is applied in solution to various baits (meat, grain, egg, french fries), allowed to dry, and placed in bait boxes or trays or broadcast by various means in target areas.

Starlicide is very highly toxic to birds and freshwater invertebrates and moderately toxic to freshwater fish. Starlicide is moderately toxic to mammals.

Starlicide does not hydrolyze, but does photodegrade in water, which, based on available data, appears to be its primary route of dissipation in the environment. Starlicide binds to organic matter in soils.

Additionally, Starlicide is also known as DRC-1339 which is a commonly used poison for the control of pest birds, especially starlings, in feedlots. The trade name is "Starlicide". The mode of action of DRC-1339 in sensitive birds is irreversible kidney and heart damage, with death normally occurring after 1-3 days following ingestion. The lethal dose of DRC-1339 in nonsensitive species is 10-100 times higher than in sensitive species. It amounts to a build up of uric acid in the birds.

The APHIS Wildlife Services (WS) website provides the following technical note on DRC-1339:

"DRC-1339 was developed as an avicide because of its differential toxicity to animals. More acute avian toxicity data are available for DRC-1339 than for any other pesticide used in the world: more than 40 species have been tested. DRC-1339 is highly toxic to most sensitive bird species (LD's range from 1 to 10 mg/kg), allowing a toxic dose to be placed on a single bait. But it is only slightly to moderately toxic to many nonsensitive birds, most predatory birds, and most mammals (LD's [lethal doses] range from 100 to 1000 mg/kg). Some species, including waterfowl and gallinaceous birds, are intermediate in sensitivity to DRC-1339 (LD's range from 10 to 100 mg/kg). Most bird species that are sometimes pests, including starlings, pigeons, blackbirds, crows, and magpies, are sensitive to DRC-1339. Many other bird species, such as raptors and some small granivores [seed-eaters] are classified as nonsensitive. Known exceptions are owls and felines, with LD's of about 5 mg/kg placing them in the sensitive category.

"NWRC (National Wildlife Research Center) and WS Operations have been monitoring the use of all DRC-1339 products since 1968. There have been no documented secondary poisonings of mammalian or avian scavengers or predators with DRC-1339, except for a crow that may have scavenged the gut contents of a recently treated pigeon. NWRC has conducted long-term feeding studies where birds poisoned by DRC-1339 were collected and fed to raptors and scavenger mammals for 30 to more than 200 days. No symptoms of poisoning or mortalities occurred."
