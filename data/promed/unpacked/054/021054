A 3-year field study in Co. Kilkenny looked at the efficacy of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in badgers and found that it could be a highly effective means of reducing the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in badger populations.

The recently published TB-focused study was funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), and involved the School of Veterinary Medicine at University College Dublin (UCD).

The study, Protective immunity against tuberculosis in a free-living badger population vaccinated orally with _Mycobacterium bovis_ Bacille Calmette-Guerin [see citation below], involved 934 badgers and covered an area approximately 755 km2 [292 sq mi] characterised by low level and rich pasture.

The area was divided into 3 zones (A, B, and C) with different levels of vaccine/placebo coverage.

It was "extensively surveyed" for badger setts, and when discovered, the sett locations were recorded and assigned a unique identification.

All setts were visited twice in each year: September to February and March to July.

According to the study, a considerable body of scientific evidence shows that badgers are an important reservoir of _Mycobacterium bovis_ and are associated with the transmission of infection to cattle.

Culling and vaccination are key to reducing infection rates within badger populations or to minimise the potential transmission of infection from infected badgers to cattle, according to the study.

It continued:

"The development of a vaccination strategy targeted at badgers is often advocated as an alternative option, where the key objective is to reduce the transmission rate of infection within a badger population by reducing the level of susceptibility to infection."

In the Kilkenny study, badgers were treated orally with

- placebo (100% in zone A);
- BCG (100% in zone C);
- randomly assigned 50%:50% treatment with BCG or placebo (in zone B).

At the end of the study, 275 badgers were removed from the trial area and underwent a detailed post-mortem examination followed by histology and culture for _M. bovis_.

Among these badgers, 83 (30.2%) were captured for the 1st time across the 3 zones, representing a nontreated proportion of the population (meaning they had not been previously vaccinated).

Analysis of the data -- based on the infection status of treated animals -- showed a prevalence of

- 52% infection in zone A (placebo);
- 39% in zone B (placebo);
- 44% in zone B (BCG vaccinated);
- 24% in zone C (BCG vaccinated).

Among the 83 nontreated badgers removed at the end of the study, the infection prevalence of animals in zone A and zone B was similar to the treated animals in these zones.

However, in Zone C, no evidence of infection was found in any of the untreated badgers.

"This is consistent with an indirect protective effect in the nonvaccinated badgers leading to a high level of population immunity," the report stated.

"The results suggest that BCG vaccination of badgers could be a highly effective means of reducing the incidence of tuberculosis in badger populations."

Abstract
----------
"Vaccination of badgers with _Mycobacterium bovis_ Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) has been shown to protect badgers against tuberculosis in experimental trials. During the 3-year County Kilkenny BCG vaccine field study, badgers were treated orally with placebo (100% in Zone A), BCG (100% in Zone C), or randomly assigned 50%:50% treatment with BCG or placebo (Zone B). At the end of the study, 275 badgers were removed from the trial area and subjected to detailed post-mortem examination followed by histology and culture for _M. bovis_. Among these badgers, 83 (30.2%) were captured for the 1st time across the 3 zones, representing a nontreated proportion of the population. Analysis of the data based on the infection status of treated animals showed a prevalence of 52% (95% CI: 40%-63%) infection in Zone A (placebo), 39% (95% CI: 17%-64%) in Zone B (placebo), 44% (95% CI: 20%-70%) in Zone B (BCG vaccinated), and 24% (95% CI: 14%-36%) in Zone C (BCG vaccinated). There were no statistically significant differences in the proportion of animals with infection involving the lung and thoracic lymph nodes, extra-thoracic infection, or in the distribution and severity scores of histological lesions. Among the 83 nontreated badgers removed at the end of the study, the infection prevalence of animals in Zone A (prevalence=46%, 95% CI: 32%-61%) and Zone B (prevalence=44%, 95% CI: 23%-67%) was similar to the treated animals in these zones. However, in Zone C, no evidence of infection was found in any of the untreated badgers (prevalence=0%, 95% CI: 0%-14%). This is consistent with an indirect protective effect in the nonvaccinated badgers leading to a high level of population immunity. The results suggest that BCG vaccination of badgers could be a highly effective means of reducing the incidence of tuberculosis in badger populations."

In the above study, the (oral lipid) vaccine (BCG strain Danish 1331) and the placebo were delivered orally to captured, anaesthetized badgers. In natural circumstances, oral vaccine needs baiting; its efficacy in field conditions is yet to be established. - Mod.AS]

A dairy farming family in Northern Ireland has spoken of the devastation of losing their entire herd to bovine TB.

The Ulster Farmers' Union featured the father and son's heartbreaking story in a video posted on its Facebook page. The 6-minute film has been viewed more than 105 000 times, and it has received 1500 reactions and more than 200 comments.

(See also: Q&A: Chief vet outlines bovine TB strategy for Northern Ireland at https://www.fwi.co.uk/livestock/health-welfare/livestock-diseases/bovine-tb/qa-chief-vet-outlines-bovine-tb-strategy-for-northern-ireland.)

In the video, the son describes how the family farm has been running for generations, but it now looks very different, with "empty fields, empty sheds, and all the cows have gone."

"The cows were our livelihood. They were almost treated like pets. Here, anything they needed, they got," the farmer said. "We had to look after them because they were our business, and they looked after us."

The evening before the cows were taken away, the dairy farmer explains how he was at home with his 5-year-old son when he asked about the cows.

"He always wants to know the whereabouts of the cows, and he asked what field are the cows going to tomorrow?" explains the farmer.

Holding back tears, he says: "It would absolutely break him to tell him you are putting the cows on a lorry, sending them away for slaughter.

"TB needs to be sorted once and for all."

The video then shows some of the cows being loaded on to a cattle lorry to be taken for slaughter.

The father explains how cows have been bred for the farm's grass-based system since the late 1970s. "There's cow families, 3 and 4 half-sisters all went on the lorry at the one time," he says.

"At the last take, there were 5 sets of mother and daughter. One cow with her granddaughter and daughter on the lorry at the one time.

"To see in-calf heifers 2 or 3 months from calving going on the lorry in December [2020] wasn't simple. They were spare heifers most years."

He adds: "TB doesn't respect which one you keep and which one goes. It was just heartbreaking to see those good heifers going away for slaughter, heavy in calf."

The farmer explains how the herd suffered another outbreak this year [2021] a fortnight to 3 weeks off calving, and more cows had to go to slaughter because of TB.

"We have been working on this all my lifetime, and I have picked bulls for components, butterfat, and protein," he says.

"One cow went away doing 9500 litres [10 039 qt] at 4.8% butterfat and 3.95% protein. Those kinds of cows aren't available out there for sale, and they were working on grass and a grass-based system. The herd average was actually 8000 litres [8454 qt] at 4.4% butterfat and 3.5% protein."

The son explains how the family has spent 40 years breeding the cows for milk quality, and "the whole lot has just been wiped out."

When the cows go down with TB, farmers only receive the market value for the livestock. There is no compensation from the government for loss of milk, or income, yet they still have a farm to manage.

"What other employee could run a business with no income?" he asks.

The son explains that the TB-condemned cows on the farm had no contact with neighbours' grazing livestock. Double fencing separates the farms, or if not, a road or a river.

In 2014, the farm suffered a major breakdown and lost half the herd within 2 tests.

"Whenever we saw we were having a problem, we started to use a bit more sexed semen. Half the herd had been inseminated with sexed semen," says the father.

"Maybe more than half the remaining herd was inseminated with sexed semen, and that's all gone. Where is next year's [2022] crop of calves going to come from?"

"We have been dealing with this the same way as we have always done, and if you do something the same way and expect a different result, then you're going to be disappointed."

The farmer urges the NI government to look at the sources of infection in wildlife to tackle the problem.

"The money we have spent over the years has all been wasted because we are not doing anything different to address the sources of infection," he says.

"The department [Daera] is going to have to take a look at where these sources of infection are coming from. We're a closed herd, fairly well fenced, no contact with other cattle, and yet we have had a major breakdown."

[In January 2021, Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) published a document titled "Bovine TB eradication strategy: a roadmap to reduce bovine TB and drive towards eradication, 2021-2030" (https://www.gov.ie/pdf/?file=https://assets.gov.ie/120577/5b2aeb07-8a56-412d-ae27-b9d37fc0a4da.pdf#page=1).

From its Executive summary, we herewith present selected sections:

"bTB levels in Ireland reached a historic low in 2016 when herd incidence fell to 3.27%. bTB levels have increased annually since then, and 2020 has seen a sharper rate of increase in disease with herd incidence reaching 4.37%.

"While this is of concern at a national level due to animal health status and related market access requirements, the most significant impacts are faced on-farm. Over 900 additional farm families experienced the farm-management and financial challenges associated with a bTB restriction in 2020 relative to 2016 (13 additional herds per week being restricted relative to 2019).

"While there are clear animal health benefits and productivity benefits associated with Ireland's bTB Programme, its primary objective is to ensure Irish farmers have the necessary herd health status access to key export markets. This includes products of animal origin (e.g., beef and milk products) as well as live animal exports.

"The bTB Programme is required under EU legislation and increasingly is a requirement in 3rd-country trade agreements. The incoming EU Animal Health Law coming into effect in April 2021 also provides for enhanced measures related to bTB. The diagnostic tests used in Ireland to identify bTB have been employed successfully in other countries that have achieved eradication. They are the best available in the world, and DAFM is continually assessing the most effective testing regime to support eradication in the Irish context. However, as with all diagnostic tests, the tests used to detect bTB have limitations."

"The wildlife/cattle interface is recognised as a significant risk pathway for disease transmission. Removal of badgers, where necessary, and proactive badger vaccination to prevent bTB transmission will continue to form an integral part of our collective efforts to reduce bTB levels [see item 1]. Enhanced farmer assistance in identifying badger setts is particularly important to strengthen the effectiveness of the wildlife programme. In areas where deer may be playing a role in disease transmission to cattle, DAFM will also support efforts to address this.

"Addressing cattle-to-cattle transmission remains a critical element of the bTB Programme, particularly in the context of residual infection on farms and in movements. Preventative measures are supportedby effective on-farm biosecurity measures, and to this end, the bTB Programme will benefit from the recently published National Farmed Animal Biosecurity Strategy. In parallel with disease trends, the cost of the bTB Programme has escalated considerably in recent years.

"With the Programme costing close to EUR 100 million [USD 118.4 million] in 2020, overall direct spending will be EUR 1 billion [USD 1.18 billion] in the period to 2030 unless significant reductions in disease can be achieved. Spending at this level represents significant commitment by farmers and the Irish taxpayer. This commitment cannot be taken for granted and highlights the urgency with which policies must be implemented that result in reduced disease transmission.

"Since its establishment in 2018, the bTB Stakeholder Forum has considered options for strengthening the bTB Programme. Policy analysis papers informed these discussions which resulted in a series of recommendations which have been central in informing the development of this strategy. In developing proposals, the forum's objective was to deliver continued and sustained reductions in bTB levels over the period 2020-2030, driving downwards towards eradication.

"The elements of the new bTB strategy [abridged] are
1. Working in partnership
2. Reducing cattle-to-cattle spread
3. Tackling disease transmission at the wildlife/cattle interface (badgers, deer, biosecurity)
4. Local area action plans
5. Improving communications about bTB
6. Legislative changes at EU level from April 2021 (pre- or post-movement testing required; changes to requirements for buying into restricted herds)
7. Financial
8. Improving programme effectiveness."

The badger vaccination field study, described in item 1, addresses article 3 in the strategy list above. Responses of the scientific community to the published results are anticipated. Could they lead to endorsement by the authorities as potentially adequate to replace (at least, partially/selectively) other population control measures of badgers in bTB-endemic areas? - Mod.AS
