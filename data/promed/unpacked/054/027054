The director general of Health Services Sindh, Dr. M Ishaq Memon, told Dawn
that only 95 people had died in the affected area due to viral infections.
Later, the DG said in a written statement, the virus which had spread in
Tharparkar during the last month had caused 'sporadic' deaths due to low
resistance on account of malnutrition resulting from drought, inadequate
access to government hospitals for lack of transport facilities and a host
of other problems.
Dr. Memon quoted a report of director health services, Mirpurkhas division,
Dr. Zulfikar Ali Shah, who had visited various villages of Chachhro Taluka
with a team of journalists, saying there had been 95 deaths in the affected
area due to the virus and "other diseases." He said seven mobile medical
teams were serving in the affected area and had treated 2 600 patients in
Chuchhro and Mithi talukas.

[This looks like an cluster of excess deaths from various infections
exacerbated by severe, drought-related malnutrition, & not an emerging
