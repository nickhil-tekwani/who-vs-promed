The Veterinary Service of Ghana has warned of more rabies related deaths, as it records acute shortage of dog vaccines. A total of 890 dog bite cases were recorded by the Veterinary Services in the last quarter of 2014. 120 of the total cases were as a result of stray dogs. There are fears the number of cases could increase this year [2015] as the number of stray dogs continue to increase on the streets of Accra and other parts of the country. The Korle Bu Teaching Hospital has also recorded an increase in rabies related deaths. Director of Public Health at the Veterinary Service, Dr. Boi Bashiru Kikimoto, told Morning Star host Kafui Dey, Tuesday [6 Jan 2015], that city authorities must collaborate with them to arrest stray dogs to avoid the spread of rabies.

"I would appeal to Ghanaians that you should report 1st any dog bite case, whether it has an owner or not. From my office, we have never had any positive case for the last quarter ... and this is not peculiar to Accra alone.

"Last year [2014] we had 17 human deaths in Ghana, 4 from Upper East, 2 from Ashanti, there was a boy who died in Assin Fosu, 3 were reported to be from Korle Bu, one died from Obuasi and other regions," Dr. Kikimoto said.

He added that "the vaccines are not harmful to human beings; I have taken anti rabies vaccines even though I have not been bitten by a dog and that's because once you take it, you are protected from any dog bite wound."

[Rabies is endemic in Ghana and is of the urban type, with dogs being the reservoir. Information pertaining to human and animal disease has been submitted to the OIE until the end of 2013. The number of human cases was 16, 14, 15 and 4 respectively for the years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013. 2014 data are not yet officially available; according to the above media report, the number of human cases during 2014 increased to become 17.

The animal-related data were:
2012: 49 rabies cases in dogs, 18 dogs destroyed, 85 558 "ring vaccinated"
2013: 53 rabies cases in dogs, 1 in a goat; 15 289 dogs "ring vaccinated"

The drastic drop in the number of dog vaccinations during 2013 should concern the public and should be remedied the earliest; the data pertaining to 2014 are requested.

The deficiency in human vaccine should be addressed the earliest. - Mod.AS
