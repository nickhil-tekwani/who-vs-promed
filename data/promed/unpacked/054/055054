Farmers in the Cuu Long (Mekong) Delta should take precautions to protect against rice diseases on the winter-spring [2014] rice crop, especially rice blast, said Ho Van Chien, Southern Plant Protection Centre. He said the large difference between day and night temperatures and inclement fog in the morning over the past days may cause the development of rice diseases.

The delta has had more than 21 000 ha of rice infected by blast diseases, 1000 ha infected by bacterial leaf blight, and more than 40 000 ha infected with brown plant hoppers, he said. For this winter-spring [2014] rice crop, farmers in the delta, the country's largest rice granary, have planted about 1.6 million hectares.

The centre warned farmers not to use mixed pesticides but specific pesticides aimed at targeting specific kinds of pests and diseases to achieve the best results. Farmers should strictly follow integrated pest management programmes when tending to their rice fields and fertilise the rice fields properly.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously classified as a strain of _M. grisea_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide with potential yield losses of more than 50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die, and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most rice strains can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water, and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable, and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.

Bacterial leaf blight (BLB) of rice is caused by _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzae_, with reported yield losses of up to 60 percent. The pathogen causes yellowing and drying of leaves, wilting of seedlings, and blight lesions (for severe strains), which may also affect panicles. Various saprophytic fungi may invade the lesions, contributing to the damage. BLB is favoured by rain, high levels of fertilizer, high humidity, standing pools of water, and warm temperatures. The bacterium is short-lived in soil and suspected to be seed borne but also to be short-lived in seeds. Grassy weeds, infected plant material such as rice stubble or ratoons [sprouts growing from the remains of the crop already harvested], and contaminated irrigation systems are thought to be the primary pathogen reservoirs. The disease spreads by windblown rain and mechanical means (for example when transplanting seedlings or by high insect activity). Disease management includes phytosanitation (control of weed and volunteer rice reservoir hosts, removal of contaminated materials), cultural measures (optimal plant spacing and fertilizers), and use of resistant crop varieties. The related _Xanthomonas oryzae_ pv. _oryzicola_ causes bacterial leaf streak of rice.
