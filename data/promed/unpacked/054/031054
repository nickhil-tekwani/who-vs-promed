Anthrax cases reported in Russia's Krasnodar territory
------------------------------------------------------
Cases of anthrax both in animals and humans have been reported in
Russia's southern Krasnodar territory, a spokesman for the Southern
regional emergencies centre told Itar-Tass on Friday [24 Sep 2010].

According to the spokesman, anthrax infections have been confirmed at
a dairy farm in the village of Uspenskoye. As many as 20 infected
cows have already been slaughtered, and their carcasses have been
burnt. Measures are being taken to prevent the spread of the disease.

Moreover, 2 persons have been hospitalised with suspected anthrax.
The health condition of 30 more farm's staff members is being monitored

[Unfortunately it seems that the Krasnodar authorities slaughtered
the cows if sick. Treatment with oxytetracycline can save them, maybe
not all, but it would aid herd reconstruction. Neither OIE nor
ProMED-mail has carried reports from Krasnodar in the last 10 years.
