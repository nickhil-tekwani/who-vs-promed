The public is being urged not to pick up or touch sick or dead wild birds after bird flu [avian inlfuenza] was confirmed among swan populations in Warwickshire and Worcestershire [West Midlands region].

The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) have now confirmed there is avian influenza A(H5N1) among swans in Stratford town centre and around Diglis Basin in Worcester.

Angela Cartwright, consultant in communicable disease control with the UKHSA [UK Health Security Agency] in the West Midlands, said the risk to the public from this strain of avian flu was "very low", but urged people to steer clear of any sick or dead birds.

"As a precaution, anyone who was not wearing appropriate PPE (personal protective equipment) while in contact with the droppings or birds in an area where the infection has been confirmed, will require close monitoring and a course of antiviral medication for 10 days from the last contact with infected birds," she said.

The UKHSA, Worcester City Council, and Stratford District Council are working with APHA and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) to manage the situation and protect public health and the risk to other birds.

The H5N1 strain, highly pathologic to birds, was first diagnosed in birds at a wild bird rescue centre near Droitwich last week. Swans at the Diglis Basin in Worcester became sick, with this same strain of avian flu confirmed.

Dead birds were collected from around the River Avon in Stratford town centre and sent to APHA's laboratory for testing, and the same strain of avian flu was confirmed.

Christopher Kettle, Stratford District Council's community protection boss, said: "The outbreak of avian flu in the wild bird population, including swans on the River Avon, is obviously of concern to residents.

"The UKHSA has made it clear that the risk of the disease transferring from birds to humans is considered to be very low. "To ensure this situation remains, the advice we have received is that members of the public should not touch or go near sick or dying birds and any dead birds found should be reported to the District Council on 01789 267 575 to assist with the disposal.

"The UK food standards agencies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers. Properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.

"We are also looking to put up posters in the area to ask people not to feed the ducks or swans and remind people to keep to footpaths and to keep dogs on leads."

Following detection of bird flu in wild birds across the UK, the Chief Veterinary Officers from England, Scotland, and Wales have declared an Avian Influenza Prevention Zone (AIPZ) across Great Britain to try to stop the disease from spreading amongst poultry and captive birds.

In areas where the infection has been confirmed or is suspected, anyone who has been in contact with sick or dead birds or their droppings should make sure any footwear is properly cleaned and thoroughly wash their hands in soap and water.

They should then notify the UK Health Security Agency's West Midlands Health Protection Team on 0344 225 3560 so that public health experts can determine if antiviral medication and active surveillance of their condition are necessary.

[From 2014 onwards HPAI H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses dominated outbreaks in Europe, with abundant genetic reassortments yielding subtypes H5N1, H5N2, H5N3, H5N4, H5N5, H5N6, and H5N8. The majority of HPAI H5 virus detections in wild and domestic birds within Europe coincide with a southwest/westward fall migration and large local waterbird aggregations during wintering. - Mod.PMB
