Environmentalists and health experts have warned small-scale miners in Busia district, [Uganda], against the use of mercury in mining gold. Most artisanal gold miners around the world are fond of mixing mercury with gold ore before exposing the mixture to heat and separating gold from the rock.

Mr John Kamese, an environmentalist working with National Association of Professional Environmentalists (NAPE), told the Daily Monitor on Saturday [23 Feb 2019] that a survey conducted last year [2018] found the blood of some miners, especially in Busia district, was contaminated with a mercury substance. He said such contamination will have a negative impact on their lives in the future. "We carried out a survey and established that the levels of mercury pollution in the blood of miners, soil, water, and food crops were very high in the mining districts," he said.

NAPE in conjunction with Uganda National Association of Community and Occupational Health (NACOH) carried out the survey between July and August 2018 in gold mining areas of Busia, Buhweju, Mubende, Namayingo, and Karamoja.

Interventions to prevent the use of mercury in mining activities are urgent, Mr Kamese said. "Mercury has been identified as very poisonous; it is classified as a neurological toxicant, which affects the nervous systems of the people who get exposed to it." Mr Kamese said the chemical is more dangerous to children, adding that it affects their brains [and makes them] prone to tumours, memory loss, and headaches. Environmentalists have also warned that the chemical, when irresponsibly disposed of from mining areas, drains into rivers and lakes, affecting the water for aquatic life and domestic use [and therefore other people who may not be mining. - Mod.TG]

Dr Bena Nanyama, the acting district health officer, Busia district, acknowledged that exposure to mercury has grave health risks, especially to miners with no protective gear. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), exposure and inhalation of mercury vapour leads to harmful effects on the nervous, digestive, and immune systems as well as the lungs and kidneys.

Ms Birgitte Stoffersen, a Danish geologist who is promoting mercury-free artisanal and small-scale gold mining in Uganda, advised the miners to adopt the use of borax to extract gold, saying it is not dangerous to the people's lives and the environment. Ms Stoffersen said scientific studies have revealed miners get more gold by use of borax than the use of mercury. Some of the gold miners who spoke to Daily Monitor said they are aware of the effects but lack options.

"I know of several children and old people in Tiira village who have developed severe health complications, and some are suffering from paralysis due to the effects resulting from the use of mercury," said [SE], an artisanal miner in Busia. Another artisanal miner, [AS], said the elimination of mercury in the gold mining industry will be difficult because it is cheaper and more available than borax.

In Busia, gold mining is in Tiira, Sikuda sub-county, Amonikakenei and Alupe in Buteba sub-county, and Syanyonja in Busitema sub-county. Mr Hassan Odima, the LC2 chairman of Tiira Parish, said the artisanal miners use bare hands to extract gold and lack protective gear such as gloves, masks, sunglasses, gumboots, and helmets.

The Busia district natural resources officer, Mr Johnson Erenyu, said they have embarked on sensitising people against the use of mercury because of the major health issues recorded in the area. "Women and children are dying in the mines. We have tried to do our part, but the miners have persisted," Mr Erenyu said.

While National Environment Management Regulations 1999 recognise the harmful effects of mercury and provide guidelines for the handling as well as transportation of such chemicals, mercury oxide is imported to the country unregulated or as a smuggled good. A recent study estimates more than 400 000 people in Uganda are directly engaged, and an additional 1.5 million are benefitting indirectly.

Uganda is home to substantial gold deposits, but its mining story is one leaving a lot to be desired; the industry is mainly run by speculators and smugglers and is riddled with corruption and illegal mining-license holders. The UK-based environmental NGO, Global Witness, last year [2018] released a report documenting corruption, mismanagement, and high-level political influence in the gold business in the country.

Gold was first reported in West Nile in 1915, but commercial mining did not start until 1933. By 1965, only 148 043 ounces were mined in Ankole, Kigezi, and Bukedi sub-regions, producing 68%, 15%, and 16%, respectively.

[Although it is easy to say, and it may be harder to do in reality, what if the government or health agencies provided some protective equipment for these people who are trying to make a living in this fashion? Respirators, gloves, boots, and other body covering would be a great start. The pictures on the original website indicate the miners are barefooted, with exposed arms, legs, and hands and no respiratory protection. It is also concerning that some of this water may be making its way back to the villages. The article does not specifically state this, but where is the communal water source, and is use of mercury contaminating the wells?

Mercury
-------
There are 3 forms of mercury: elemental mercury, inorganic mercury, and organic mercury.

Elemental mercury is also known as metallic mercury, liquid mercury, liquid silver, and quicksilver, and is an extremely heavy, odorless, silver-colored liquid. Mercury exists as a natural element in the earth's crust. Since this is the most likely form of mercury to which these children were exposed, this comment is confined to the toxicity of elemental mercury. There are several sources of elemental mercury, including broken mercury thermometers, broken fluorescent light bulbs, dental amalgam fillings, mercury-containing latex paints, extraction of gold from ore using mercury, and contaminated clothing from workers in thermometer-making plants. Elemental mercury is also used as a Mexican folk medicine to treat "empacho", a chronic stomach disorder.

Elemental mercury is the most commonly swallowed form of mercury, usually from a broken thermometer. Fortunately, elemental mercury is not absorbed from the stomach and will not cause any poisoning in a healthy person. The swallowed mercury is slippery; it will roll into the stomach and out into the bowels, and it will be quickly eliminated without causing any symptoms. However, if the person has severe inflammatory bowel disease or a fistula (hole or opening) in the intestine, problems may result if the mercury is not all cleared out, resulting in prolonged exposure.

Handling liquid mercury for a very short period of time usually does not result in any problems. An allergic rash is possible. Mercury is not well absorbed through the skin, so skin contact is not likely to cause mercury poisoning, especially with a brief one-time exposure. Even if a person has cuts in the skin, mercury is too heavy to be contained by a cut. Merely washing the wound well will remove the mercury.

Inhalation of elemental mercury vapors is the main cause of toxicity, as mercury is well absorbed through the lungs. Problems from inhalation result either from a large one-time exposure or a long-term exposure. A small one-time exposure is not likely to cause problems.

The lungs are the primary target organ following a large one-time inhalation exposure of mercury vapor. Other signs and symptoms may develop as well. Clinical signs develop within a few hours and include chills, metallic taste, mouth sores, swollen gums, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, headache, weakness, confusion, shortness of breath, cough, chest tightness, bronchitis, pneumonia, and kidney damage.

Long-term exposure of inhaled vapors is generally more dangerous, with the nervous system being the primary target organ of toxicity. Symptoms may occur within weeks but usually develop insidiously over a period of years. Neurologic symptoms include tremors, headaches, short-term memory loss, incoordination, weakness, loss of appetite, altered sense of taste and smell, numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, insomnia, and excessive sweating. Psychiatric effects are also seen after long-term exposure.

Acrodynia is a condition of pain and dusky pink discoloration in the hands and feet, most often seen in children chronically exposed to heavy metals, especially with mercury. Acrodynia can result from repeated exposures to mercury-containing latex paint fumes. Acrodynia is usually seen in younger children. The symptoms include chills, sweating, body rash, irritability, sleeplessness, leg cramps, light sensitivity in the eyes, peeling skin layers on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and swelling of the cheeks, nose, hands, and feet.

People are regularly exposed to all 3 types of mercury, although the organic type is the most likely to cause adverse health effects because of its tendency to build up in the body.

Mercury vapor is very dangerous. Symptoms of mercury poisoning are progressive. The 1st stage is paresthesia, distinguished by a tingling or numb sensation in the fingers, toes, and face. Paresthesia may be followed by difficulty walking and speaking, impaired vision and hearing, fatigue, weakness, headache, trouble concentrating, and tremors. Methods of detoxification or treatment are limited. In this particular case, there may be some environmental cleanup issues. - Mod.TG
