4 female doctors and as many other staff members have contracted the
deadly Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) virus at the Holy
Family Hospital [HFH], setting alarm bells ringing in the city and the
health department to take preventive measures to avoid further
outbreaks of the disease.

Doctors at the hospital told Dawn on Wednesday [26 Sep 2010] that
blood samples of 4 female doctors, 2 nurses, one student nurse and a
ward boy sent to the National Institute of Health (NIH) had been
confirmed positive for the infection. The doctors and staff have been
shifted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for treatment.

The doctors contracted the infection while dealing with 2 patients
being treated at the hospital. One patient had been brought to the HFH
on Tue 14 Sep 2010 and later moved to the Shifa International
Hospital, Islamabad [see: ProMED-mail post: Crimean-Congo hem. fever -
Pakistan (03): (PB) 20100923.3440]. Another CCHF patient died at Holy
Family Hospital on Fri 24 Sep 2010, 2 days after being admitted there.
The HFH administration has sent blood samples of its staff members to
the NIH as precautionary measures.

Dr Javed Hayyat, who is supervising treatment of the patients, told
Dawn that the female doctors were feeling well and there were no
symptoms of CCHF; however, the 2 nurses were suffering from fever. He
said the doctors [are believed to have] contracted the virus during
the past 12 days. "No symptoms were developed, and the said virus [was
no longer evident] after 2 weeks, if the patient had not [exhibited]
fever," he said.

When contacted, HFH Medical Superintendent Capt. (retired) Dr Fayyaz
confirmed that blood tests on the 8 staff members were positive for
CCHF. "We had sent the blood samples of those dealing with the CCHF
patients to NIH, and these 8 have tested positive for the viral
disease," he said.

He said only 2 nurses had developed symptoms; however, the symptoms
had not developed in the female house officers. "After consultation
with Rawalpindi Medical College Principal Dr Afzal Farooqui and other
senior specialists, we have started treatment [ribavirin treatment?]
of the patients," he said. He said further blood samples from the 8
patients had been dispatched to the NIH.

CCHF haemorrhagic fever is a zoonotic disease that animals [transmit]
to humans. In Pakistan, the 1st human outbreak [of CCHF] was reported
in 1976 at Rawalpindi, when a doctor died while treating a patient at
the Central General Hospital (now Benazir Bhutto Hospital). A
25-year-old intern physician also died at Holy Family Hospital in 2002
while treating a Congo fever patient.

[It is unclear whether there is any connection between these patients
in Rawlpindi and the patients with an undiagnosed illness, which may
be CCHF, now under treatment in the neighboring province of
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (formerly North-West Frontier Province) and the
single CCHF patient under treatment in Karachi (Sindh province).
Clarification would be welcomed.

In view of the past tragic history of nosocomial cases of CCHF in
Pakistani hospitals, it is surprising that there has not been greater
awareness of the danger of nosocomial infection. It may be that this
is another unfortunate consequence of the devastation associated with
the recent flooding throughout the Indus valley.

[I find this report confusing; the 4 doctors are said to be in the
ICU, but the "house officers" -- presumably the same doctors -- had no
symptoms; in which case, why are they there and why were their blood
specimens sent for testing? Perhaps they are there in lieu of a
quarantine ward, and are being tested & treated preventively. I also
find it sad that hospital staff are so uninformed about CCHF cases
occurring in other states of their country -- don't they read the
newspapers or ProMED? -- and apparently do not take the proper
precautions when treating a patient with a hemorrhagic disease. -
