Abstract
--------
We describe 4 cases in Sweden of verified treatment failures of pharyngeal gonorrhoea with ceftriaxone (500 mg; n=3) or cefotaxime (500 mg; n=1) monotherapy [2013-2014]. All the ceftriaxone treatment failures were caused by the internationally spreading multidrug-resistant gonococcal NG-MAST genogroup 1407 clone. Increased awareness of treatment failures is crucial particularly when antimicrobial monotherapy is used. Frequent test of cure and appropriate verification/falsification of suspected treatment failures, as well as implementation of recommended dual antimicrobial therapy are imperative.

_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ has developed resistance to all antimicrobials previously used as 1st-line treatment for gonorrhoea [1-4]. Clinical resistance is now emerging to the extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs), that is, cefixime (oral) and the more potent ceftriaxone (injectable). Many treatment failures with cefixime have been verified in Japan, Europe, Canada, and South Africa. No failure to treat urogenital gonorrhoea with ceftriaxone (250 mg-1 g), the last remaining option for 1st-line empiric antimicrobial monotherapy, has been detected as yet. However, some few failures to treat pharyngeal gonorrhoea with ceftriaxone have been verified in Japan (n=1), Australia (n=3), Sweden (n=1) and Slovenia (n=1) [4-10]. In recent years, extensively drug-resistant (XDR) gonococcal strains with high-level ceftriaxone resistance were also reported from Japan, France and Spain [2,9-11].

Case descriptions
-----------------
From February to May 2013, 3 cases of suspected failure to treat pharyngeal gonorrhoea with ceftriaxone 500 mg intramuscularly were reported from 2 clinics for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in Sweden (Table). All 3 patients reported having had unprotected oral and vaginal sex with heterosexual contacts in Stockholm. Case A was a woman in her 30s, with pharyngeal symptoms including pharyngitis. Cases B and C, both in their 50s, were asymptomatic. Pharyngeal and urogenital samples were taken and all patients had a positive gonococcal pharyngeal culture. Furthermore, the urogenital samples from the Cases B and C were positive in a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) (BD ProbeTec GC Qx Amplified DNA Assay, Becton Dickinson). All 3 patients were administered a single dose of 500 mg ceftriaxone intramuscularly (Day 1). When returning for follow-up after 7 to 22 days, all patients were asymptomatic but had persistent positive gonococcal pharyngeal cultures. All urogenital samples were negative. Finally, all 3 patients were successfully treated with a single dose of 1 g ceftriaxone intramuscularly between Day 7 and 27, which was confirmed at follow-up visits with negative pharyngeal cultures between Day 22 and 48 (Table).

In May 2014, 1 case of suspected failure to treat pharyngeal gonorrhoea with cefotaxime 500 mg intramuscularly was reported from an STI clinic in Karlskrona, Sweden. This patient (Case D), a man in his 30s, attended the clinic because he had had unprotected oral and vaginal sex with a woman diagnosed with gonorrhoea. On Day 1, the patient was asymptomatic and sampled from the pharynx, urethra, and rectum. The pharyngeal sample was positive for gonococci in culture and he was treated with a single dose of 500 mg cefotaxime intramuscularly. At the follow-up visit (Day 7), the patient was still asymptomatic, however, a pharyngeal sample remained positive in culture. The patient was treated with a single dose of 250 mg ceftriaxone intramuscularly plus a single oral dose of 1 g azithromycin (day 14). On Day 26, the patient returned for test of cure and the pharyngeal culture was negative for gonococci (Table).

Characterisation of _N. gonorrhoeae_ isolates
---------------------------------------------
The pre- and post-treatment gonococcal isolates were species-confirmed by sugar utilisation test, Phadebact Monoclonal GC Test (Pharmacia Diagnostics), and MaldiTOF MS (Bruker Daltonics). The paired isolates from each case were indistinguishable using _N. gonorrhoeae_ multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST [12]) and the isolates from Cases A, B, and C belonged to the NG-MAST genogroup 1407 clone [4,13] (Table). Using Etest (AB bioMerieux), the isolates from Cases A, B, and C (ceftriaxone treatment failures) showed elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), that is, 0.064-0.125 mg/L, which is equal to the European resistance breakpoint (greater than 0.125 mg/L) [14]. In Case D (cefotaxime treatment failure), according to the European resistance breakpoints [14], the paired isolates were resistant to cefotaxime (MIC: 0.5 mg/L) and the pre-treatment isolate also to ceftriaxone (MIC: 0.25 mg/L) (Table).

Sequencing of ESC resistance determinants [1,3,4,6,9,10,15] showed that all the paired isolates belonging to Cases A, B and C contained the penA mosaic allele XXXIV, which has been correlated with NG-MAST genogroup 1407, decreased susceptibility or resistance to ESCs and ESC treatment failures [1,4-6,9,11]. The isolates from Case D contained the penA mosaic allele XIII [10]. In addition, all isolates contained mtrR and penB alterations that further increase the ESC MICs [1,3-6,9-11,15].

Discussion
----------
This paper reports 4 cases of verified pharyngeal gonorrhoea treatment failure in Sweden using injectable ESCs, that is, ceftriaxone (n=3) and cefotaxime (n=1). The failures were verified in accordance with international recommendations [2,4], that is, clinical records were obtained, reinfection was excluded, pre- and post-treatment isolates were identical using highly discriminatory molecular epidemiological typing, and the isolates had elevated ESC MICs and well recognised ESC resistance determinants. Reinfection was considered to be excluded as much as possible for all cases. Accordingly, all patients were strongly advised to abstain from any sexual contacts before their follow-up visit and all 4 patients repeatedly assured that they had not had any unprotected sexual contacts between the ceftriaxone/cefotaxime treatment and test of cure. Furthermore, Case D was infected by a casual sexual contact.

In the current emergent situation of fear that gonorrhoea may become untreatable [1-3,10], recommendations of using dual antimicrobial therapy (mainly ceftriaxone plus azithromycin) have been introduced in the United States [16] and Europe [17]. No appropriate well-designed international study has yet assessed the implementation of dual antimicrobial therapy. However, as observed by the authors in many international projects the implementation of these guidelines appears suboptimal in several European countries and monotherapy with ceftriaxone remains frequently used.

No failure to treat urogenital gonorrhoea with ceftriaxone (250 mg-1 g) monotherapy has been verified to date. However, the observed initial accumulation of failures treating pharyngeal gonorrhoea was not unexpected, because these infections are substantially harder to eradicate with most antimicrobials than urogenital gonorrhoea [1-4,6,18]. As shown in the present study, ceftriaxone 500 mg monotherapy can be sufficient to eradicate urogenital gonorrhoea but not the concomitant pharyngeal gonorrhoea in the same patient. The pharyngeal gonorrhoea of the patients was instead successfully treated with 1 g ceftriaxone monotherapy or 250 mg ceftriaxone plus 1 g azithromycin. Unfortunately, 1 g ceftriaxone monotherapy may only provide a short-term solution [1,2,4,19,20] judging from the failure to treat the pharyngeal gonorrhoea caused by the 1st gonococcal XDR strain with 1 g ceftriaxone [10], ceftriaxone MICs of all the identified gonococcal XDR strains [9-11], emergence of ceftriaxone resistance and its anticipated trend, and pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic simulations showing that the benefits of increasing the ceftriaxone dose from 500 mg to 1 g are limited when taking into account the high ceftriaxone MICs detected recent years [19]. Consequently, dual antimicrobial therapy, such as 500 mg ceftriaxone intramuscularly plus 2 g azithromycin orally, as recommended by the European gonorrhoea guideline [17], should ideally be implemented. It remains unknown if ceftriaxone and azithromycin act synergistically in vivo. However, most importantly, there are no indications, in vitro or in vivo, that they act antagonistically. According to a review from 2010, 99 percent of urogenital and 98 percent of pharyngeal gonorrhoea cases may be treatable with 2 g azithromycin monotherapy [21]. Consequently, nearly all gonorrhoea cases (ceftriaxone-resistant or not) are treatable with even 2 g azithromycin monotherapy. Nevertheless, azithromycin monotherapy is not recommended due to the spread of gonococcal strains with high-level resistance to azithromycin and the anticipated rapid selection of azithromycin resistance [1,17,20].

All ceftriaxone treatment failures in the present study (Cases A, B, and C) were caused by the internationally spreading multidrug-resistant gonococcal NG-MAST genogroup 1407 clone, which has caused many ESC treatment failures internationally [4-6,9,15]. However, the cefotaxime treatment failure was caused by the unrelated NG-MAST ST4539, which shows that clinical resistance to injectable ESCs is emerging also in other gonococcal clones.

In conclusion, increased awareness of treatment failures particularly with antimicrobial monotherapy, improved implementation of recommended dual antimicrobial therapy (such as 500 mg ceftriaxone plus 2 g azithromycin [17]), frequent test of cure (ideally for all cases, and at least for all cases of pharyngeal gonorrhoea), and appropriate verification/falsification of suspected treatment failures (including subsequent tracing of sexual contacts of the index case with the treatment failure) are essential internationally. An enhanced focus on pharyngeal gonorrhoea is also crucial, with increased sampling and prevention, such as promotion of condom use also when practising oral sex. Ultimately, novel options for effective treatment of gonorrhoea are imperative.

[In 2012 US CDC updated its recommendations for treatment of uncomplicated urogenital, anorectal, and pharyngeal gonorrhea to combination therapy with a single intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone 250 mg plus either a single dose of azithromycin 1 g orally or doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm). The CDC considers that the 250 mg dose of ceftriaxone is sufficient to treat gonococcal infection at all anatomic sites caused by strains currently circulating in the United States (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm).

The updated European gonorrhea guideline, however, recommends a 500 mg intramuscular dose of ceftriaxone plus azithromycin 2 g oral dose for uncomplicated gonorrhea (http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956462412472837).

Pharyngeal gonococcal infections are known to be substantially harder to eradicate with most antimicrobials than urogenital gonorrhea (Moran JS: Treating uncomplicated _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ infections: is the anatomic site of infection important? Sex Transm Dis. 1995; 22(1): 39-47; http://journals.lww.com/stdjournal/Abstract/1995/01000/Treating_Uncomplicated_Neisseria_gonorrhoeae.7.aspx.) The Eurosurveillance report above describes 4 cases in Sweden of verified treatment failures of pharyngeal gonorrhea with ceftriaxone (500 mg; n=3) or cefotaxime (500 mg; n=1) monotherapy.

Although sufficient to eradicate urogenital gonorrhea in 2 of the 4 patients, ceftriaxone 500 mg monotherapy failed to eradicate gonococci in concomitant pharyngeal gonorrhea in the same patients. The ceftriaxone MICs (0.064-0.125 mg/L) of the gonococcal isolates from the 3 ceftriaxone pharyngeal gonorrhea treatment failures were actually below both the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) resistance breakpoint MIC (equal to or greater than 0.5 micrograms per mL) and the European resistance breakpoint MIC (equal to or greater than 0.25 micrograms per mL) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6131a3.htm and http://www.eucast.org/fileadmin/src/media/PDFs/EUCAST_files/Breakpoint_tables/Breakpoint_table_v_4.0.pdf).

The cefotaxime MICs (0. 5 micrograms per mL) of the 2 isolates from the one cefotaxime pharyngeal gonorrhea treatment failure were above the European resistance breakpoint MIC (equal to or greater than 0.25 micrograms per mL). Thus it seems that gonococci persisted in the pharynx despite having MICs in several instances in the susceptible range, perhaps because in the doses used, the pharyngeal antibiotic concentrations were too low or less active than at other infected sites. Pharyngeal gonorrhea in the 4 patients was subsequently successfully treated with 1 g ceftriaxone monotherapy or 250 mg ceftriaxone plus 1 g azithromycin.

Most gonococcal infections of the pharynx are asymptomatic and can be relatively common in some populations (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/gonococcal-infections.htm). Culture of the pharynx in patients presenting with gonococcal disease, even in the absence of pharyngeal symptoms, and, as the authors of the Eurosurveillance report emphasize, supplemented by use of recommended combined antimicrobial therapy with azithromycin, which might enhance treatment efficacy for pharyngeal infection, and test of cure for pharyngeal gonorrhea (http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/gonococcal-infections.htm), are essential to control the continued spread of this disease. - Mod.ML
