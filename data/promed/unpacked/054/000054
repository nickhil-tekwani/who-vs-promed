[1] Cholera - Kenya

The Ministry of Health has issued an alert of cholera outbreak in the
country. Addressing the press in Nairobi on Thu 10 May 2007, director of
medical services Dr James Nyikal confirmed 32 deaths and 528 cases in 8
districts in the country.
Nyikal said West Pokot district had the highest number of infections with
151 cases, while Turkana district had recorded the highest number of deaths
at 9. He said the latest cases have been reported in Kisumu and Siaya
districts.
Dr Nyikal said the ministry has taken control measures but cautioned the
public to observe hygiene. At the same time, he has directed the provincial
administration to work closely with the public health officers to ensure
all households have a toilet.

[2] Cholera - Namibia (Ohangwena)

Cholera and acute diarrhea cases are on the increase in the Ohangwena
Region with reports of more deaths and infection cases. A week ago, health
authorities reported 343 cases, including those of diarrhea. Now the number
has escalated to a record 475 of which 27 were confirmed as cholera.
In the Engela district of the Ohangwena Region, 10 deaths from acute
diarrhea have been reported so far. About 17 cases of diarrhea have been
found in Opuwo, while other affected areas are Ruacana and Okatope in the
north.
In a brief interview with New Era yesterday, permanent secretary of the
Ministry of Health and Social Services, Dr Kalumbi Shangula, said "In all
instances, they are imported cases. And the 10 deaths are due to a result
of acute diarrhea and not cholera," said Dr Shangula, adding that most of
the victims turn out to be elderly people with weak immune systems that
make them more prone to the disease.
However, public worry about the scare of a suspected cholera outbreak in
the north resulted in May Day celebrations last week being cancelled by the
National Union of Namibian Workers at Oshikango. The organizing union's
deputy secretary-general, Tadeus Erago, said that although the public rally
was organized and scheduled for the border town, it had to be [cancelled]
due to fear of a cholera outbreak. The union was advised by the local
health authority that it was not good to gather many people in one place
because this would result in the spread of the communicable disease.
The water [supply] in Oshikango remains closed due to non-payment by
municipal authorities. In view of this, the Ministry of Health and Social
Services is busy negotiating with Namwater [Namibia Water Corporation] to
re-open the water [supply] for the sake of good health.

A Ministry of Health spokesperson says the cholera outbreak that was
reported in Chongwe, Lusaka Province, seems to be contained. Canicius Banda
said the 27 patients from around the Luangwa Bridge area who reported to be
suffering from cholera have since been treated and discharged from St
Luke's Hospital.
Dr Banda has also disclosed that Matero cholera center in the capital,
Lusaka, has no patients and has since been closed.

[4] Cholera, fluoroquinolone resistant - France ex India (Rajasthan)
Date: Thu 3 May 2007
Source: Eurosurveillance weekly release 2007; 12(5) [edited]
<http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2007/070503.asp#2>

In late March 2007, 2 returning French travelers were hospitalized for
cholera caused by _Vibrio cholerae_ serogroup O1 serotype Ogawa. In a
separate event, a 3rd case was hospitalized in early April 2007. All 3
travelers had returned from a trip to India (Rajasthan). They all required
urgent specialized care in an intensive care unit and were treated by
intravenous rehydration therapy and antibiotics. The _V. cholerae_ O1
strains isolated during the 1st cluster of 2 cases and the 3rd unrelated
case were tested for antibiotic susceptibility. These tests showed
resistance to nalidixic acid with decreased susceptibility to ofloxacin and
ciprofloxacin. The isolates were sensitive to tetracycline and doxycycline,
and one of them was sensitive to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
The vast majority of cholera cases worldwide are treated by oral
rehydration therapy (ORT) which, when administered in a timely and
sufficient manner, has transformed the prognosis of cholera since the early
1960s and remains the mainstay of cholera treatment (1). A total of 129
imported cases of confirmed cholera were diagnosed in France between 1973
and 2005, with a median of 3 diagnosed cases per year (2). An additional 2
cases were diagnosed in 2006. Although many may go undetected, the number
of diagnosed cases is on the decrease. Imported cholera cases, however, are
diagnosed increasingly in infants or elderly persons who may not tolerate
well massive fluid loss (2,3).
Antibiotics may be a useful adjunct (1) as they have been shown to reduce
the duration of diarrhea (1,4-8), the volume of diarrhea (5,6,8), the
volume of fluids required for rehydration (9,10), the duration of hospital
stay (9), and the duration of excretion of _V. cholerae_ (4-8). Although
emergence of multiple antibiotic resistance during cholera epidemic
outbreaks has been documented over the past 30 years (11,12), there is
little data on the prognosis of cholera in patients infected with resistant
strains. Available data points to longer-lasting and more severe cholera in
patients treated with inappropriate antibiotics (1). In industrialized
countries, treating with inappropriate antibiotics may be associated with
increased morbidity in patients and higher costs to the community (1).
In a 2004 publication (13), the World Health Organization (WHO) examined
the possible antibiotic regimen indicated when needed in outbreak or highly
endemic situations. The WHO recommends single-dose doxycycline or
tetracycline 4 times a day for 3 days or erythromycin in young children 4
times a day for 4 days. Although WHO does not recommend fluoroquinolones
for treating suspected cholera, they are widely used in the 1st-line
treatment of diarrhea caused by infections acquired in developing
countries. _V. cholerae_ O1 strains resistant to fluoroquinolones have
emerged in India (14) and Bangladesh (15,16) over the past years for a
number of reasons. Quite logically, it was only a matter of time before
resistant strains were imported to Europe. The impact of emerging
antibiotic-resistant cholera strains is greatest on patients in endemic
countries but also affects imported cases. Community- or hospital-based
clinicians considering antibiotic therapy for cholera in returning
travelers before susceptibility testing should bear in mind that at least 3
cases imported to France from Rajasthan in 2007 showed decreased
susceptibility to fluoroquinolones.

[5] Cholera - India

Waterborne diseases have begun spreading their tentacles in the national
capital [Delhi] as summer season reaches its peak. According to Sahara
Samay sources, diseases such as jaundice, cholera, and typhoid have
engulfed many areas in the capital. Water crisis forces most of the
Delhiites to drink impure water that leads to the breaking out of epidemics.
As many as 70 cases of cholera have been reported. Talking to [Sahara
Samay], a doctor warned the residents against using adulterated water.
People should wash their hands properly before taking food and after coming
back from the toilet, he added.

[6] Shigellosis - USA (Missouri)

Health officials are calling on parents, caretakers, and workers at day
care centers and schools to help end an outbreak of a highly contagious
intestinal illness called shigellosis. The outbreak started in early
November 2006 and has spread to about 60 day care facilities in the city
and in north St Louis County and 2 in Fenton, said Michael Williams,
director of the communicable disease division of the St Louis County Health
Department.
County health officials have recorded 359 cases, 331 of which struck in
2007. In the city, 152 people have been sickened by the bacterial disease,
with about 30 new cases appearing each month, said Pamela Rice Walker,
acting director of the City Health Department. Most of the sick have been
preschool-age children or young elementary school children -- many of whom
have siblings in day care, she said. St Charles County has had 3 cases of
shigellosis in the past month, 2 of which were associated with day cares.
More than half of the cases in St Louis County have been in children aged 4
and younger. Most of the cases could be tied directly to day care centers,
through people who work at or attend a day care, or their family members.
Statewide, 485 people have come down with shigellosis, most in the St Louis
region, with smaller outbreaks in central and southeastern Missouri. The
Illinois Department of Health has no reports of shigellosis in the Metro
East area.
Day care centers are the perfect setting for shigellosis to spread,
Williams said. "Little kids have notoriously bad hygiene, and they like to
share everything," he said.
