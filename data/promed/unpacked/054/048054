New virus strain behind child deaths suspected
----------------------------------------------
At a time when the state health department is groping in the dark
about the reason behind the deaths of 13 children over a span of 6
days at Karandighi in North Dinajpur, an experts' team from the
National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED) and the
city-based virus unit of the Indian Council of Medical Research
(ICMR) suspected a new strain of virus has hit the area.

"We have tried to find out the exact cause behind the deaths of the
children. But the symptoms suggest that the disease is neither
measles nor Japanese encephalitis, which were primarily suspected to
be the cause of deaths. It is probably a new strain of virus, which
can be confirmed only after detailed test of viscera samples at the
National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune," said an expert who
visited the area.

Earlier, the state health department had suspected measles was
causing children deaths in the area. But as the experts' teams made
it clear that measles was not the cause of deaths, the state health
department is now facing a real trouble. A team from the NIV will
visit the area soon. Dr MK Bhattacharya, additional director of NICED
and ICMR's city-based virus unit, said: "Convulsion is the main
symptom of the disease. And the patient is dying within a short span
of time. We have collected one sample, which will be sent to NIV
soon. It appears that the disease is caused by a new strain of virus.
It could be confirmed by the NIV after detailed examination of the sample."

"So far, it can be said that as the victims had no record of high
temperature or rashes, it can't be measles. Similarly, as only
children between the age group of 1-6 years are falling victim to the
disease, it can't be Japanese encephalitis or Nipah virus. All these
suggest it is perhaps a new strain of virus, which is yet to be
diagnosed," he added.

[Japanese encephalitis, Nipah virus, and measles have been excluded
on rather arbitrary reasoning, and the description of the disease is
too limited to allow further speculation. Also it is not entirely
clear why the deaths have been attributed to virus infection. The
result of the investigation by the National Institute of Virology in
Pune is awaited with interest, but the provision of a single clinical
sample will restrict the scope of any investigation.

The city of Karandighi is located in the North Dinajpur district of
the Indian state of West Bengal, close to the border with Bangladesh.
