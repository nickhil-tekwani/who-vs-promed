Regarding ProMED-mail posting 20160328.4122167, Rabies - Americas (08): USA, there is a minor error that needs more thorough explaining:

In article [7]:
"[7] New Jersey - feline, human exposure
Date: 24 Mar 2016
Source: North Jersey.com [edited]
http://www.northjersey.com/news/four-saddle-river-residents-advised-to-get-treatment-after-stray-cat-found-to-have-rabies-1.1532985"


"Four Saddle River residents were advised to begin treatment for rabies after a stray cat that they had been exposed to was found to have the potentially deadly disease, authorities said Thursday [24 Mar 2016]. [Rabies is a deadly disease for humans without treatment. Rabies is deadly to animals. The word "potentially" is misleading. - Mod.TG]."

The post/exposure protocol is only for those domestic animals for which a rabies vaccine is approved. An animal that had never been vaccinated and one not current on its vaccination must have the 3-vaccination protocol plus isolation (there are differences in isolation periods based on the state of residence). Currently vaccinated animals need a rabies vaccine booster and 45 days of isolation. In all cases, in order to reduce the risk of human exposure to animals that may develop rabies as a result of an attack by a rabid animal, the 1st recommendation is to euthanize exposed animals."

[My grateful appreciation goes out to Dr. Alexander for his assistance.

I indicated that the word "potentially" was misleading. At the time of the writing, my thought process was that rabies is deadly to unvaccinated animals. I did not follow through to explain what happens to vaccinated animals exposed to a rabid source. - Mod.TG
