Seventeen children in the 5-14 age group died of suspected Japanese
encephalitis in August and September in Guntur district. Five of the deaths
were reported from the city. While 38 cases of Japanese encephalitis were
reported from different parts of the district in August and September, at
least two to three cases were now being reported on an average every day in
various primary health centres in the district and the Government General
Hospital here, a senior medical officer in the medical and health
department said.
"We have collected samples of the blood serum from the affected patients
and sent them for a culture test at the Veterinary and Biological Research
Institute, Hyderabad. If the samples test positive only then can we
conclude that the deaths occurred because of Japanese encephalitis," the
official pointed out.
The disease is prevalent in the Sattenapalli division and the surrounding
mandals in Guntur district.
One each of the disease related deaths have been reported from Vinukonda,
China Garlapadu, Panidam, Madapadu, Pedamakkena, Garnepudi, Venigandla,
Yadavarru and other villages. In Guntur city, two deaths were reported at
Chinna Bazar and one each at Gundaraopet, Bongarala-beedu and
Kannavarithota areas. The district malaria control wing has, meanwhile,
intensified fogging and anti-larval operations in the affected areas to
check the spread of the disease.
In Guntur city too, the civic body intensified its efforts against the
spread of mosquitoes, and Commissioner M T Krishna Babu warned pig herders
to rear their animals at least two km away from the city. However, a
recent High Court judgement prohibiting the elimination of stray pigs in
city areas is coming in the way of the civic body in tackling the pig
menace effectively, sources said.

[Difficult to say whether the text of this newspaper report is confusing
because of ignorance on the part of the reporter, receipt of incorrect
information, or a language problem. I deleted some of the most confusing
and incorrect statements.
As best I can tell, Assam is in the far east of India, south of Bhutan and
Tibet; Nalgonda is in the state of Andhra Pradesh, as is Guntur, only a
quick 295 km train ride from Hyderabad. I wonder whether that train is
called the Guntur Tooty. - Mod.CHC
