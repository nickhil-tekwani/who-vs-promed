A bighorn sheep herd in BC's [British Columbia] interior is in trouble after coming into contact with domestic sheep and the contagious disease they carry.

The Chasm herd near Clinton, BC has lost more than 2/3 of its members since 2013, with the population decreasing from 110 to 28 members at last count. Scientists say bighorn sheep are dying from a particular type of pneumonia that domestic sheep are immune to but that wild sheep are not.

Separating the 2 species is key to the survival of bighorn sheep, an animal that is featured in BC's coat of arms.

"If we keep the 2 species separated, that's our ultimate goal. If we can achieve that, we'll have healthy wild sheep and healthy domestic sheep farms," said Chris Barker, director of the Wild Sheep Society of BC.

A bighorn sheep can die within 5 days after coming into contact with a domestic sheep carrying this particular pneumonia bacteria, according to Barker.

Building barriers between domestic and bighorn sheep may be the most effective way of keeping the wild populations safe, says Jesse Zeeman with the BC Wildlife Federation.

But the pneumonia bacteria are airborne, which means farmers will have to build a dual fence, about 30 feet [9 m] apart, to prevent the disease from traveling herd to herd.

If even one farmer doesn't build a fence, that could spell disaster for the already fragile bighorn population.

Wild sheep that do come into contact with domestic sheep have to be killed to protect the rest of the population.

"We have a policy in place that if wild sheep have contact with domestic sheep, then you phone a conservation officer," said Barker.

"The conservation officer will go out and take that animal out of the equation so that it doesn't go back and actually endanger the healthy sheep population."

The town of Clinton, BC is holding a public meeting on [Sun 7 Feb 2016] to raise awareness about the issue.

[Bighorn sheep pneumonia has traditionally been considered a multifactorial disease, caused by multiple pathogens. Due to their complexity, understanding multifactorial phenomena like this, usually require integrated and sustained research efforts. The absence of established and universal explanations for pneumonia outbreaks contributes to conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders over land use and management practices.

Bighorn sheep pneumonia web of causation may have an important environmental component. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggests that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant.

However, recent evidence indicates that in northwestern USA there seems to be a pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids.
