The Tweed River oyster industry has been devastated by its second major
setback in two years, with about 75 percent of the region's oysters wiped
out by a mystery disease. The four major oyster growers in the region say
they have had enough and are considering closing down permanently with all
reporting hefty losses amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
Senior NSW Fisheries manager (oysters) Andrew Derwent said the disease,
which did not affect humans, was caused by a parasite which blocked the
oysters' digestive gland and caused them to "simply starve to death". He
said the parasite started appearing in the Tweed River and Terranora
Broadwater in far northern NSW in April and was possibly linked to an acid
sulphate soil run-off, which was behind a major fish kill last week in
nearby Cudgen Lake. There was no cure for the disease. Oyster leases would
have to be restocked with oysters from areas of Sydney at huge cost to
growers.
"It's very quick and a very lethal disease but nobody knows much about it
because the life cycle of the parasite is not described," Mr Derwent said.
He said the oysters were infected by the disease's "initial spurt" and new
oyster stock grown in the river would not be affected. Mr Derwent said the
last time it had appeared in northern NSW was in the early 80s but most
oyster-growing regions around the world had a version of the disease.
