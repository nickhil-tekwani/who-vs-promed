The number of suspected cases of cholera in San Cristobal since the outbreak was detected approximately 2 weeks ago has increased to 211 with approximately 40 percent confirmed.

Of the [211] cases that presented to [the health sector], 158 were admitted to the Juan Pablo Pina hospital and the rest in the Nigua hospital. The majority were treated with plan A which consists of oral rehydration without admission to the hospital [outpatient treatment].

Manuel Hilario, the provincial director of Public Health, said that they are continuing control measures and are following the families of the affected individuals. The Regional and Provincial Health Authorities informed [us] that they are conducting monitoring of chlorination to measure the chlorine levels at the 'end of the line' [at faucets where individuals get their water].

At least one person entered this Thursday, 5 Sep 2013, to the cholera unit of the Regional Hospital Alejandro Cabral, with symptoms of the disease, bringing the total up to 29 suspected cases in the province of San Juan. Public health authorities stated that they maintained continuous monitoring in the community of Mogollon, where the majority of the cases were recorded. They said that everything points to the fact that the water from the river is the primary source of the outbreak of diarrhea in adults and minors.

[For a map of the Dominican Republic showing provinces, see http://www.bestcountryreports.com/Political_Map_Dominican%20Republic_Provinces.php. Of note, San Juan province is in the central western part of the country, one province removed from the border with Haiti, whereas San Cristobal is in the southcentral part of the country adjacent to the Federal District and Santo Domingo (the capital). Hence there appears to be significant geographic spread of cholera in the country.
