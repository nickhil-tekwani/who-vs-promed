Dzhalalidin Gaybulin, the director of the National Center for
Quarantine and Especially Dangerous Diseases, reported at the 15 Nov
2011 meeting of the Supreme Council on Land and Agrarian Issues, Water
Resources, Environment and Regional Development, that despite the
measures taken the situation remains tense regarding several
infectious diseases such as anthrax, brucellosis, and rabies.

During the 1st 9 months of 2011, 13 people contracted anthrax,
including 7 cases in Jalal-Abad and 6 in Osh. The reason is the large
number of ground foci and the delayed vaccination of livestock. There
are many instances when veterinarians permit the slaughter of sick
animals.

[This represents an increase since our last report in June 2011 of 5
more cases in Jalal-Abad Oblast [province] and 3 more in Osh Oblast. I
fear it is the same-old same-old story that we have seen for decades
in these oblasts adjoining the uncontrolled situation in the Uzbek
Ferghana valley. Any deficiencies in the Kyrgyz control programme, and
there are many, never go unrewarded. In such poverty afflicted rural
areas the temptation to slaughter and butcher morbidly sick livestock
is great in order to recover some of the cost by selling the meat and
giving it to relatives -- what you give to one today, you will get
back another day when they slaughter an animal. - Mod MHJ]
