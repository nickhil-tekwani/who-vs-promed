Suspected Case of Variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease in South Africa
-------------------------------------------------------------------
JOHANNESBURG: A Rustenburg woman who died on 22 Jun 2000 could be the first
victim in South Africa of (New) Variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (vCJD),
the human form of bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE or mad cow disease).
vCJD has already killed 89 people in Britain and Europe since it was
reported for the first time in Britain 4 years ago.
The 35 year-old woman became ill in February of [2000. Later she was no
longer able to use either her arms or legs and lost control over her bodily
functions. Finally she was no longer able to talk, swallow or breathe on
her own. Tests costing thousands of rands were conducted abroad and in
South Africa to determine what was wrong with her. Doctors suspected
everything from cancer to multiple sclerosis.
Only following a brain biopsy about 2 weeks before her death was it
established that she was suffering from Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD). No
further tests were conducted to establish whether she had vCJD. The tissue
has since been destroyed. Her husband broke his silence this week because
there had been no follow-up by the health authorities. "We were average
meat eaters. We used to eat out about twice a week and my wife loved
hamburgers," he told The Sunday Independent.
Dr. Ben Makgale of the Impala Mine Hospital in Rustenburg, one of the
doctors who treated the woman, said she had definitely not contracted the
classical form of CJD. He believes she died of vCJD, which is linked to
BSE. National Veterinary Services Director Dr. Gideon Bruckner said no
cases of BSE have been found in South Africa. "In 1986 (shortly after
outbreaks of the disease in Britain) import control measures were
instituted and since 1998 import controls have been in place on all bone
and meat from Europe. We are still not importing meat from Britain."
However, according to Professor Bob Swanepoel, Special Pathogen Unit Chief
at the National Institute of Virology, CJD is not reported appropriately in
South Africa. "We see about 3 cases a year. This is not in line with
population figures." He added that it would not surprise him if a few cases
of vCJD were to occur in South Africa, as people immigrate or spend time
abroad.
Meanwhile the uncertainty over where the woman contracted the disease
remains a huge burden for her husband. He stated that she had never been
outside the country and did not even possess a passport.

[ProMED-mail is indebted also to Misty Corton <corton@icon.co.za> for
drawing attention to this report. The destruction of the brain tissue
sample is unfortunate. Possibly only the relatively young age of the victim
supports the diagnosis of vCJD. - Mod.CP
