Province.

Description of affected population in the new outbreaks:
Suspected clinical foot and mouth disease (FMD) has been detected within a
herd of 2153 cattle at Totororo diptank, Zhombe Communal Area in Kwekwe
district, Midlands province. Totororo diptank is approximately 70 km east
of Lutope 5 diptank. However, both Lutope 5 and Totororo are in adjacent
Communal Areas in the Midlands province.
Infection was detected during intensified surveillance put in place since
the outbreak at Lutope 5 diptank reported on 5 June 2002. Investigations
are in progress at two other diptanks in the Zhombe Communal Area, namely:
Don Juan and Somalala.

species/susceptible/cases/deaths/destroyed/slaughtered
bov/2153/22/0/0/0

Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: epithelia have been collected and
submitted for analysis to the Botswana Vaccine Institute (OIE Reference
Laboratory for FMD), Botswana, and to the Onderstepoort Veterinary
Institute, South Africa.
B. Causal agent: unknown. SAT2 virus is suspected.

Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: illegal movement, possibly by
motor transport of cattle from the previously affected Lutope 5 area, may
be the source of infection.
B. Mode of spread: direct contact and aerosol transmission at dipping or
watering points.
C. Other epidemiological details: there is extensive movement of cattle
across adjacent Communal Areas mainly as a result of the prevailing drought.

Control measures during reporting period:
a. Quarantine
Kwekwe and Kadoma districts have been added to the areas under quarantine
since Aug 2001.
b. Zoning
c. Vaccination
Vaccination coverage will now include areas at risk in the Kwekwe district
in the Midlands province as well as adjacent areas in Kadoma district in
Mashonaland West province.

[Previous report from Zimbabwe indicated that the outbreak is caused by FMD
virus strain SAT 2, the same strain which had caused 18 recorded outbreaks
during 2001. The Zimbabwean authorities deserve to be commended for their
intensive surveillance and detailed, timely reporting. - Mod. AS]
