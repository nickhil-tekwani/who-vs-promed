Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - Saudi Arabia 26 Feb 2015
---------------------
Between [20 and 22 Feb 2015], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 4 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, including one death. Cases are listed by date of reporting, with the most recent case listed 1st.

Details of the cases are as follows:

1 - A 58 year old, non-national male from Dammam city developed symptoms on [18 Feb 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [20 Feb 2015]. The patient has no comorbidities and no history of exposure to any known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in a stable condition in a negative pressure isolation room on a ward. [reported on MOH website on 22 Feb 2015 as from Khobar. - Mod.MPP]

2 - A 46 year old male from Khober city was admitted to hospital on [9 Feb 2015] for unrelated medical conditions. The patient was discharged from the hospital on [14 Feb 2015]. He developed symptoms on [17 Feb 2015] and was readmitted to the same hospital on the same day [17 Feb 2015]. The patient was treated in the same ward and by the same health workers as 3 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases that were reported in a previous DON on [23 Feb 2015] (cases n. 24, 25, 41). He has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, the patient is in a critical condition in ICU.

Oboho IK, Tomczyk SM, Al-Asmari AM, Banjar AA, Al-Mugti H, Aloraini MS, et al. 2014 MERS-CoV outbreak in Jeddah -- a link to health care facilities. N Engl J Med. 2015 Feb 26;372(9):846-54. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa1408636.

2014 MERS-CoV outbreak in Jeddah--a link to health care facilities.

Abstract:
BACKGROUND:
A marked increase in the number of cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection occurred in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in early 2014. We evaluated patients with MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah to explore reasons for this increase and to assess the epidemiologic and clinical features of this disease.

METHODS:
We identified all cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection in Jeddah that were reported to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health from [1 Jan 2014 through 16 May 2014]. We conducted telephone interviews with symptomatic patients who were not health care personnel, and we reviewed hospital records. We identified patients who were reported as being asymptomatic and interviewed them regarding a history of symptoms in the month before testing. Descriptive analyses were performed.

RESULTS:
Of 255 patients with laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection, 93 died (case fatality rate, 36.5 per cent). The median age of all patients was 45 years (interquartile range, 30 to 59), and 174 patients (68.2 per cent) were male. A total of 64 patients (25.1 per cent) were reported to be asymptomatic. Of the 191 symptomatic patients, 40 (20.9 per cent) were health care personnel. Among the 151 symptomatic patients who were not health care personnel, 112 (74.2 per cent) had data that could be assessed, and 109 (97.3 per cent) of these patients had had contact with a health care facility, a person with a confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection, or someone with severe respiratory illness in the 14 days before the onset of illness. The remaining 3 patients (2.7 per cent) reported no such contacts. Of the 64 patients who had been reported as asymptomatic, 33 (52 per cent) were interviewed, and 26 of these 33 (79 per cent) reported at least one symptom that was consistent with a viral respiratory illness.

CONCLUSIONS:
The majority of patients in the Jeddah MERS-CoV outbreak had contact with a health care facility, other patients, or both. This highlights the role of health care-associated transmission. (supported by the Ministry of Health, Saudi Arabia, and by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

[4] Saudi Arabia, MOH press release 2 Mar 2015
Date: 2 Mar 2015
Source: Saudi MOH press release [in Arabic, mach. trans. edited]
http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/Ministry/MediaCenter/News/Pages/News-2015-03-01-003.aspx


As part of the Ministry of Health's (MOH) desire to keep everyone aware of the latest developments of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), in addition to the daily update report issued in this regard, the Ministry will issue a weekly press report including all efforts exerted to deal with the virus and the recorded cases.

Within this context, the MOH announces that during the period from 3rd to 9th of Jumada [22-28 Feb 2015], a total of 1493 samples were tested for MERS-CoV at the MOH laboratories, of which 18 were confirmed, amid people aged between 24 and 91 years old, with 12 in Riyadh and one case in each in Al-Ahsa, Khobar, Jeddah, Najran, Buraydah, and Al-Jouf. Nationalities included: 9 Saudis, 3 Yemenis, 3 Filipinos, 2 Indians, 1 Egyptian, 1 Sudanese and 1 Syrian.

These 18 confirmed cases included 13 males and 5 females; 6 cases were monitored in the private sector, 6 cases in the public sector (Ministry of Health), 2 cases in a National Guard hospital, 3 cases in university hospitals, and one case in a military hospital.

Meanwhile, the MOH revealed that rapid response teams tasked with infection control made approximately 26 field visits, including initial and follow-up visits, during the past week. In addition, the Preventive Medicine and Health Awareness Teams affiliated with the Ministry of Health visited 10 houses and identified and listed 63 people as contacts with MERS-CoV infected patients, and these individuals have been placed under regular follow-up through the end of the established incubation period [14 days].

Regarding the complaints [assessments?] handled by the Ministry of Agriculture teams (including following up previous cases of direct contact with camels), they have reached up to 6 complaints [assessments] as following: (2 in Al-Ahsa, and 1 in each of Riyadh, Qassim, Al Madinah and Tabuk).

The MOH reiterated that the Command and Control Center continues its efforts around the clock by carrying out epidemiological surveillance tasks, making sure that all governmental and private health facilities are applying infection control measures as well as coordinating with the relevant government sectors, international health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), and consulting firms to follow up all developments regarding coronavirus. [In keeping with this, a media report on 2 Mar 2015 mentioned that 2 private hospitals were fined 200 000 Riyals (USD 53 324) each for "not committing to following methods and failing to report suspected and confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. In addition, a 3rd hospital is under investigation for not reporting a suspected case of MERS-CoV infection." http://www.okaz.com.sa/new/mobile/20150301/Con20150301756031.htm).- Mod.MPP]

[The above reports reflect the continued/ongoing transmission of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia. In less than a week's time since the last update, there have been 19 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia and 12 newly reported fatalities, bringing the total number of cases reported by Saudi Arabia since June 2012 to 931, including 400 deaths (case fatality rate 43 per cent).

Reviewing the data reported on the Saudi MOH website -- information on daily numbers of newly confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries are systematically available beginning on 16 Apr 2014 (see http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/ccc/pressreleases/Pages/default.aspx) -- one clearly sees that April and May 2014 were months with significant transmission, with a total of 209 cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in May 2014 and 177 cases reported in April 2014 (with partial month information). This is followed by February 2015, when 75 cases were reported, and then October 2014, when 36 cases were reported. In the other months, less than 30 cases were reported per month: June 2014 (28 cases), July 2014 (9 cases), August 2014 (5 cases), September 2014 (29 cases), November 2014 (25 cases), December 2014 (11 cases), and January 2015 (20 cases).

One can't help but wonder what may be going on in Saudi Arabia to explain the major increase in reported cases that began in February 2015. Is this increase related to improved surveillance (case finding) activities in the country? Is it due to a change in the virus with increased person-to-person transmission? Is it due to the camel calving season with increase in juvenile camels with active MERS-CoV infection?

Clearly, there is significant nosocomial transmission ongoing in the country. In the NEJM article in section [3] above, the major outbreak seen in spring of 2014 in Jeddah showed a significant amount of transmission ongoing in the healthcare environment. Looking at the more recent reported cases, of the 86 cases reported since 1 Feb 2015, 22 (25.6 per cent) had a history of contact with another case in the healthcare environment, and an additional 13 (15.1 per cent) had a history of possible contact with another case in the healthcare environment that is currently under investigation. Of note is that 71 of the 86 cases (82.6 per cent) had a history of "pre-existing disease", suggesting this is a population with periodic to frequent contact with the healthcare environment, perhaps an additional marker for nosocomial transmission.

With respect to contact with camels and camel products, 10 of the 86 cases (11.6 per cent) reported since the beginning of February 2015 had a history of camel or camel product exposure in the 14 days preceding onset of illness, and an additional 7 (8.1 per cent) had a possible history of animal or animal product exposure in the 14 days preceding onset of illness that was under investigation.

The WHO update reflects the global tally of cases reported to WHO as of 22 Feb 2015: 1030 cases and at least 381 deaths (case fatality rate of 37 per cent).

In the ECDC weekly Communicable Disease Threat Report, as of 26 Feb 2015, the ECDC tally of cases reported by local health authorities worldwide was 1056, including 426 deaths (case fatality rate 40 per cent). (see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-28-feb-2015.pdf).

Helen Branswell raised a very good point/food for thought in a tweet on 27 Feb 2015: "H5N1 has killed 428 people in 11 years, MERS-CoV has killed close to that in 3 years."
