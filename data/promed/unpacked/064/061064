In your report on Monday 13 March 2000 concerning bone-meal and feeding
practices in Norway the title of the report implies a case of BSE in pigs
in Norway.
The Norwegian Animal Health Authority wishes to comment that there has
never been diagnosed any case of BSE in either ruminants or other farm
animals in Norway. A ban on feeding ruminant meat and bone meal to
ruminants was implemented in Norwegian legislation in June 1990.
We acknowledge there is no ban on feeding mammalian meat and bone meal to
other farm animals in Norway. We follow the current EU legislation and
practice in this aspect. To the best of our knowledge, no other countries
other than UK have imposed a total ban on feeding mammalian meat and bone
meal to other farm animals than ruminants.
Norwegian legislation requires meat and bone meal production to be
undertaken under strict heat treatment, holding time and pressure. The
requirements are stricter than the recommended temperature and holding time
proposed by the European Scientific Steering Committee (i.e. increase
temperature by 3 degrees or double holding time).

[The original report said, as you pointed out, meat and bone meal may be
fed to other animals, just not to ruminants. It further stated the pigs had
been experimentally infected and succumbed to the disease. The original
post in no way says pigs in Norway have the disease, only that continued
feeding practices could allow such a case to develop. - Mod.TG
