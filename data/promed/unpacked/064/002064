[This is the official OIE report which supplements the critical
information posted yesterday from Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. T. Mettenleiter
and colleagues at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut. See:
Avian influenza (188): Saudi Arabia, Germany (Brandenburg) 20071217.4061.

Every outbreak presents the opportunity for either an formal or
informal assessment of risk. Informally, in my opinion, backyard
poultry present a mixed risk profile. It is good that such backyard
flocks are not in the middle of a large, vertically integrated
poultry company which then puts extremely large numbers of birds and
potentially employees throughout the company at some level of risk.
On the other hand, backyard poultry outbreaks pose a highly variable
risk depending on the knowledge of the backyard farmers, physical
facilities, management techniques and many other factors that cover a
wide range of risk possibilities.

In any case, we will appreciate any further updates of information on
both the epidemiologic and molecular level. - Mod.PC]
