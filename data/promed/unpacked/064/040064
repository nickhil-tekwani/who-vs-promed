Between early July and 22 Aug 2010, 81 cases of West Nile
neuroinvasive disease were reported in the region of Central
Macedonia, northern Greece. The median age of cases was 70 years.
Encephalitis, meningoencephalitis, or aseptic meningitis occurred
mainly in patients aged 50 years or older. This is the 1st time that
West Nile virus (WNV) infection has been documented in humans in
Greece. Enhanced surveillance and mosquito control measures have been
implemented.

Results
-------
By 22 Aug 2010, 99 cases of WNV infection had been notified to
KEELPNO [Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention]. Of
these, 81 had central nervous system manifestations (West Nile
neuroinvasive disease, WNND) and 18 (8 probable and 10 confirmed
cases) had only mild symptoms of fever and headache. We analyse here
the 81 cases of WNND. Of these, 39 were confirmed and 42 were
probable cases. The overall incidence of WNND was 0.72 cases per 100
000 population.

In total, 77 serum and 47 CSF specimens were available; for 45 of the
81 WNND patients both CSF and serum specimens were provided, while
for 4 patients only CSF was available. WNV-specific IgM antibodies
were detected in all 77 serum and in 39 of the 47 CSF specimens,
while WNV-specific IgG antibodies were detected in 42 of the 77 serum
and 17 of the 47 CSF specimens. In 39 of the 45 patients for whom
both types of specimen were available, the presence of IgM in both
CSF and serum was seen, proving autochthonous antibody production;
for IgG this was not tested. As cross-reactions are common among
flaviviruses, specimens were also tested for tick-borne encephalitis
(TBE) virus (although TBE is not prevalent in the area and none of
the patients reported tick bites): all were negative. Low
cross-reactivity was seen with dengue virus; however, when a positive
result was obtained for dengue virus, the titres were very low
compared with the high titres seen for WNV. None of the patients had
been vaccinated for yellow fever. RT-nested PCR was negative in all
specimens tested.

Serological surveys conducted in humans in the 1980s and in 2007 in
Greece identified WNV antibodies in approximately 1 percent of
selected populations (that is, farmers, wood-cutters, shepherds) in
the region of Central Macedonia. Of 392 serum samples collected from
residents in a selected urban area in the district of Imathia
(central Greece) in 2007, 6 were positive for WNV, of which 4 were
confirmed by microneutralisation assay. The authors concluded that
WNV or related viruses circulate in endemic cycles in rural areas in
Greece. In contrast, a survey of 9590 blood donations and 115 CSF
samples from patients with aseptic meningitis in Greece between 2005
and 2007 revealed no positive results for WNV by nucleic acid test.
However, the sources of the clinical samples were major laboratories
and/or blood banks in the cities of Athens and Ioannina.

Discussion and conclusions
--------------------------
The presence of WNV in animals is not monitored routinely in Greece.
However, a few ad-hoc studies have been conducted. In a
seroprevalence survey in animals in 1980, antibodies to WNV were
found in 8.8 percent of sheep, 8.7 percent of goats, 3.9 percent of
cattle, 20.4 percent of horses, 1.4 percent of pigs, and 24.5 percent
of birds. In an unpublished survey conducted from May 2001 to
December 2004, 302 of 7549 (4 percent) equine serum samples were
found positive for WNV using neutralisation tests; positive samples
in equines were found in 36 of 49 districts (prefectures) studied
from all parts of Greece (O Mangana, Ministry of Agriculture,
personal communication, 10 Aug 2010).

In conclusion, previous studies in humans and animals suggest that
WNV has probably been circulating in the region of Central Macedonia
and possibly in other parts of Greece for many years. Increased
rainfall, high temperatures and humidity during recent months, as
well as the geographical features (that is, river deltas, rice
fields, irrigated plains) of some parts of the region of Central
Macedonia, have probably favoured the multiplication of _Culex_
species, leading to the occurrence of numerous cases of WNV infection
in humans.

[This report provides additional information about the WNV outbreak
in Greek Macedonia and some historical information about other WNV
studies and surveys done in Greece that indicate that WNV circulation
has been occurring there for several years, apparently without
causing obvious outbreaks.
