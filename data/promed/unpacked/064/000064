The parasite that causes the deadliest form of malaria is showing the
1st signs of resistance to the best new drug against it.

Combination treatments using artemisinin, an antimalaria drug
extracted from a plant used in traditional Chinese medicine, have
been hailed in recent years as the biggest hope for eradicating
malaria from Africa, where more than 2000 children die from the
disease each day.

Now a series of studies, including one recently published in The New
England Journal of Medicine and one due out soon, have cemented a
consensus among researchers that artemisinin is losing its potency
here [in Cambodia] and that increased efforts are needed to prevent
the drug-resistant malaria from leaving here and spreading across the
globe.

Admiral R Timothy Ziemer, a retired admiral of the United States Navy
who heads the USD 1.2 billion President's Malaria Initiative, met with
Thai and Cambodian officials last month [December 2008] to assess the
resistance problem, which affects the same drugs used by the malaria
initiative in Africa.

Though the studies show relatively early signs of resistance to
artemisinin, the drugs were judged to have failed in only 2 patients
in the recently published study. Even they were eventually cured. But
malaria experts note that several times in the past, this same area
around the Thai-Cambodian border appears to have been a starting point
for drug-resistant strains of malaria, starting in the 1950s with the
drug chloroquine. It took decades for this resistance to spread
across the world, so by the same token, artemisinin-based drugs are
almost sure to be useful for many years to come.

To protect against artemisinin resistance, the global health
authorities are trying to assure that it is sold only as a
combination pill with other antimalaria medicines that linger longer
in the blood, mopping up any artemisinin-resistant parasites.

The 2 most recent tests showing artemisinin resistance were done with
pills that had no combination drug. But if resistance spreads, there
are no new drugs to take the place of artemisinin-based combinations
and no immediate prospects under development.

Pascal Ringwald, malaria coordinator at the World Health Organization
(WHO), who 3 years ago led a study of drug resistance in Cambodia, is
co-author of a coming study on the subject. "We know it's not yet in
Bangladesh," he said. "It's not yet in India." Scientists have
documented how malarial parasites that were resistant to chloroquine
in the 1950s spread across Thailand, Burma, India, and over to Africa,
where a vast majority of the nearly one million annual malaria-related
deaths occur.

To prevent a recurrence with artemisinin therapies, the United States
has put aside political considerations and approved a
malaria-monitoring center in military-run Myanmar, formerly Burma.
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the largest donors to
malaria research, is giving USD 14 million to the Thai and Cambodian
governments to help pay for a containment program.

That program includes efforts to supply the area with mosquito nets,
a screening program for everyone living in affected areas, and
follow-up visits by health workers to assess the effectiveness of the
drugs, said Dr Duong Socheat, director of Cambodia's National Malaria
Center. On the Thai side of the border, the government has
"motorcycle microscopists" who take blood samples from villagers and
migrant workers, analyze them on the spot, and distribute antimalaria
drugs. But some experts would like to see an even more aggressive
approach.

The falciparum parasite is one of 4 types of malaria and by far the
most virulent. It enters the bloodstream through a mosquito bite, and
after incubating about 2 weeks, it multiplies and takes over red
blood cells. There, it causes fever, chills, headaches, and nausea,
among other symptoms. If untreated, the infected cells can block
blood vessels and fatally cut off blood supply to vital organs.

The recent studies show that artemisinin-based drugs are becoming
less effective in removing the parasite from the bloodstream. While a
few years ago it took the drugs 48 hours to clear the bloodstream of
parasites, it now can take 120 hours.

"What our study demonstrates is that therapy for some patients fails;
the malaria goes away and comes back," said Lt Col Mark M Fukuda, a
United States Army doctor whose study was published in The New
England Journal of Medicine in December [2008].

Different regions rely on different artemisinin combinations. The
Cambodian government recommends that artemisinin be combined with
mefloquine, which was developed by the American military and is known
commercially as Lariam. Artemether, a derivative of artemisinin, is
often combined with another antimalarial drug, lumefantrine. This was
recently judged to be the most effective combination in a study of
children in Papua New Guinea.

The same combination is also expected to be approved for sale in the
United States soon, marketed by Novartis and mainly intended for
people traveling overseas or for those who arrive in the United
States with malaria.

The mosquito responsible for transmission of malaria is still endemic
in the United States. But modern housing, better access to health
care, and the use of insecticides have virtually eradicated the
disease in wealthier countries.

Dr Fukuda calls this region of Cambodia the "canary in the coal mine"
for drug resistance. In the past, migrant workers in plantations and
gem mines are believed to have helped spread drug-resistant strains
westward. A history of civil unrest, counterfeit drugs, and a weak and
underfinanced government have made it difficult to control malaria. In
the case of chloroquine, preventive use of the drug -- including
putting it in table salt to protect a wide swath of the population --
might have actually encouraged resistance to the drug, Dr Fukuda and
others say.

It was not until the 1990s that mefloquine, the American army drug,
was combined with artemisinin, made from a Chinese herb.
Artemisinin-based combinations turned out to be fast acting and seemed
to slow transmission of the disease, said Dr John MacArthur, an
infectious disease expert with the United States Agency for
International Development in Bangkok. Dr MacArthur and others say
resistance to malaria drugs is a natural consequence of widespread use
of the drug.

Still, some researchers remain concerned about sending the wrong
message to the public about the efficacy of artemisinin-based drugs.
"This is not the death knell of artemisinin," said Dr Nicholas White,
a malaria expert who is chairman of a joint research program between
Oxford University and Mahidol University in Thailand. "The drug still
works in Cambodia, [just] maybe not as well as before." But given the
history of drug failures here [in Cambodia], there appears to be a
consensus on the solution. "Get rid of all malaria from Cambodia," Dr
White said. "Eradicate it. Eliminate it."

Information Networks (IRIN) News report [edited]

A deadly strain of malaria along the Thai-Cambodian border is
becoming increasingly immune to treatment, threatening the global
effort to end malaria, new evidence shows.

Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), whereby patients take both a
fast-acting and slow-acting drug to kill the parasite, is losing its
therapeutic effects as treatment is taking longer.

"We are facing a problem that instead of killing the parasite within
24 to 36 hours as before, ACT now needs up to 120 hours to kill the
parasites," Pascal Ringwald, a medical officer at the World Health
Organization (WHO) in charge of monitoring anti-malarial drug
resistance, told IRIN from Geneva.

The parasite's resistance to artemisinin, one of 2 drugs in ACT
therapy, is the driving factor behind the deterioration of ACT.

Usually, doctors will prescribe artemisinin with one of many
slower-acting drugs. Yet the problem is not only artemisinin
resistance, which has existed since the 1970s, but rather tolerance to
ACT, the more advanced therapy consisting of 2 drugs, Ringwald said.
Artemisinin monotherapy refers to taking the drug alone and is not
recommended by the WHO.

"Artemisinin resistance appears in parts of Southeast Asia where
there has been rampant and uncontrolled use of artemisinin
monotherapy," Sir Richard Feachem, director of the Global Health
Group at the University of California at San Francisco, told IRIN.

At 1/10th the price of ACT and without its adverse side effects, such
as vomiting, artemisinin monotherapy continues to remain a popular
choice for many.

However, if the threat is not contained, resistant malaria will
spread through the region and hit poor communities in particular,
Feachem warned.

Duong Socheat, director of the National Centre for Parasitology,
Entomology and Malaria Control (see:
<http://www.cnm.gov.kh/indexs.htm>)
in Phnom Penh, told IRIN that ACT and outreach and prevention tools
like mosquito nets had seen remarkable progress despite a tolerance
threat. A total of 100 000 malaria cases were reported in 2006,
falling to 59 000 in 2007, and 54 000 in 2008.

The malaria death rate has been halved in only 2 years, from 396 in
2006 to 241 in 2007 and 184 in 2008.

At an emergency meeting in October [2008], the WHO recommended a
switch to a new ACT therapy called dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine
(DHA-PIP) for 2009, which is virtually 100 percent effective
according to new trial results in Cambodia.

The previous ACT treatment since 2001, artesunate mefloquine, is
still 90 percent effective but unpopular among at-risk populations
that still use monotherapy despite the ban.

Merchants often sell cheap, counterfeit monotherapies in rural areas.

The WHO also recommended wider distribution of mosquito nets,
stricter enforcement of the ban on monotherapies, and the rapid
deployment of WHO-endorsed drugs.

Yet malaria has been developing resistance to artemisinin for
decades, and ACT tolerance is only a new phase in the parasite's
evolution.

Since the 1970s, factors such as gem-mining migrants from all over
Southeast Asia mixing malaria strains at the Thai-Cambodia border, an
unregulated drug market, and overuse of artemisinin monotherapy have
all caused _Plasmodium falciparum_, a common malaria parasite in
Cambodia, to develop resistance to the drug.

The government and WHO responded by endorsing ACT in 2001 and banning
artemisinin-only therapy. But even ACT, despite being more than 90
percent effective against malaria, will need to be adapted soon,
Feachem said.

"Ensuring that artemisinin is always given with another drug in the
form of ACT is a clever use of a clever drug," Feachem said.
"However, parasite resistance will eventually catch up with this, and
for this reason, the development of new drugs ... is of the utmost
importance to the health of people worldwide."

Fake drugs and patients not complying with their treatment schedules
are other factors. "If people don't take their drugs regularly, then
they will have problems with resistance," Hou Nirmita, head of the
health department at the Ministry of Women's Affairs, told IRIN.

But Feachem, who thinks malaria could be eradicated worldwide by
2050, sees hope. "The challenge of drug resistance, and the fact that
we can never prevent the development of resistance in the long term,
provides a strong argument for the acceleration of elimination and
control efforts now," he said. "To delay or to implement programs in
a half-hearted manner is both expensive and dangerous," he explained.

According to the WHO World Malaria report for 2008 (see
<http://www.who.int/malaria/wmr2008/>),
half the world's population is at risk, and an estimated 247 million
cases led to nearly one million deaths in 2006. Pregnant women and
children in Africa are especially threatened, the WHO says.

[The documentation of early indications of artemisinin combination
therapy (ACT) resistance/failure is disconcerting. The recent
significant inroads that have been made vis a vis reduction in
mortality rate associated with malaria will be threatened if
resistance to ACT increases. As mentioned in the newswires above,
there is precedence for development of antimalarial therapy
resistance on the Thai Cambodian border, first observed with
chloroquine therapy and later with other antimalarials. PRO/MBDS has
had a number of postings on the prevalence of counterfeit
antimalarials in the region, one factor that is felt to contribute to
the development of the resistance. Other factors include the use of
monotherapy with artemisinin alone (and suboptimal treatment of
cases), and the widespread use of antimalarials for febrile illnesses
without documentation that the illnesses were actually malaria.

Recent publications have been discussing the early signs of
developing ACT resistance. In a December 2008 letter to the editor of
the New England Journal of Medicine, Noedl et al described a study on
60 patients who received artemisinin therapy for _Plasmodium
falciparum_ infection in Cambodia. Of these 60 patients, 4 had
reemergence of parasitemia between days 21 and 28 after the start of
treatment, and 2 of these 4 patients (3.3 percent of total studied)
were classified as having artemisinin-resistant infection (see ref.
1). Wongsrichanalai and Meshnick discussed 3 published studies
demonstrating the early appearance of decreased efficacy of parasite
clearance associated with artemisinin-mefloquine combination therapy
near the Cambodia-Thailand border (see refs. 3-5).

It is not entirely unexpected that artemisinin resistance should
develop as it does with all antimicrobial agents. This part of the
world has been the hot spot for resistance starting with chloroquine
(1st report Moore DV, Lanier JE: Observations on Two _Plasmodium
falciparum_ Infections with an Abnormal Response to Chloroquine. Am J
Trop. Med Hyg. 1961; 10:5-9, abstract available at
<http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/content/abstract/10/1/5>).

Two recent papers report artemisine resistance on the Thai-Cambodia
border:
1) Wongsrichanalai C and Meshnick SR:
Declining Artesunate-Mefloquine Efficacy Against _Falciparum_ Malaria
on the Cambodia-Thailand Border. EID 2008; 14: 716-9, available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/14/5/pdfs/716.pdf>.

2) Noedl H et al: Evidence of Artemisinin-Resistant Malaria in Western
Cambodia. N Engl J Med 2008; 359: 2616-20, available at
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/reprint/359/24/2619.pdf>).

Combination therapy with sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine and mefloquine
(FansiMef) was unable to prevent mefloquine resistance emerging in
Thailand. A recent study from Africa reports that 50 percent of _P.
falciparum_ isolates from Africa has increased inhibitory
concentration of lumefantrine, a drug commonly combined with
artemisinin, and this should be kept in mind in Cambodia as well.

Drug resistance develops when treatment is done with sub-inhibitory
concentration for too short a period. The practice of selling malaria
drugs as individual pills encourage underdosing and the problem of
fake drugs with either no drug or low content of the active compound
enhance the development of resistance. Thus, quality control of drugs
needs to be enforced and quality controlled -- perhaps more emphasis
on traditional prevention including impregnated bed nets and
screening of houses should be a priority. - Mod.EP]
