In July 2020, the OIE created a portal for COVID-19 information. The site provides useful information on the OIE's COVID-19 activities during the pandemic and includes OIE's response, questions and answers, events in animals, expert groups and guidance, and media resources.

"In a few months, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our communities and ways of life. With devastating effects on society in nearly all countries of the globe, it has also heavily challenged our food supply chains, livelihoods, economies, as well as animal production systems. All these components are intrinsically linked.

The unprecedented nature of this pandemic and the mysteries around this new virus have required innovative approaches to tackle it. At a time when much uncertainty remains and much work still needs to be undertaken to understand how the virus emerged and entered the human population, one certainty abides: collaboration across sectors is key to respond to this crisis.

The OIE has been intensively working with its network of experts and liaising closely with its members to better understand the virus and its emergence and to enhance the capacity of countries to respond to this multifaceted crisis. The activities of veterinary services contribute to addressing critical needs, such as food supply, which are heavily challenged in the current circumstances. In these times where solidarity is more important than ever, veterinary services have also been supporting the response capacity of human health services in various ways."
