Mosquitoes belonging to the genus _Culex_ are primarily responsible for
both the amplification of SLE in birds and vectoring the disease to dead
end hosts (such as man.) In Louisiana, the culprit for both aspects of the
disease is _Culex quinquefasciatus_. This mosquito has a definite
preference to feed upon birds as opposed to humans. In fact, this mosquito
is so skittish that a person would pretty much need to be asleep in order
for it to attempt to take a bloodmeal. Keeping windows closed or well
screened is usually sufficient protection from this mosquito.
I don't have any answers as to why SLE was not detected in the sentinel
chickens prior to human infection. Typically, most sentinel flocks will
show significant seroconversion before the disease starts showing up in
humans.

[The litany is that _Culex_ mosquitoes are enzootic and epizootic vectors
and I have no reason to doubt that's true. However, when chickens are not
seroconverting before humans are becoming sick, either the chickens are in
the wrong place, the chicken bloods are not being tested in a timely
fashion or inadequately, or there is the possibility that another vector is
involved. I doubt that's true but it is possible, isn't it? In another
southern state SLE virus has been detected in _Anopheles_ mosquitoes and
the International Catalogue of Arboviruses lists many, many mosquito
species from which SLE virus has been isolated.
Well screened windows are usually found on the houses of people who can
afford to screen them well. That ain't everyone.
My question to which Mr. Wallette does not have the answer is the one we
need an answer to. See below. - Mod.CHC

Several years ago Jefferson Parish "privatized" their mosquito control.
Their control program was "sold" to the lowest bidder. Mosquito control in
bordering Orleans Parish remains a function of city government. I have an
idea this might be part of the answer. Surveillance is carefully
monitored in Orleans and spot supplemental spraying is used as needed. The
last I heard the privatized services actually used significantly more
chemicals since they do not have good surveillance data.
Would love to hear a response from the private provider in Jefferson.
