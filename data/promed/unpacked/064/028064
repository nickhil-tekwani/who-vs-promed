A 27-year-old woman from Mendieta died, infected by a hantavirus in Jujuy province, according to a statement issued by the Provincial Ministry of Health.

With the hospital admission of the young woman, municipal workers from the Health Office carried out relevant control [activities] in the area around the home of the infected woman.

The Ministry of Health stated that so far this year [2014], 98 suspected cases of hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] have been registered throughout entire province.

Given this [case], the community was reminded about the necessity of keeping houses clean in order to avoid contracting the disease, which is fatal and is transmitted by rodents that enter the house to escape the cold. It was also stated that one could become infected without the rodents being present through exposure to [virus contaminated] urine and feces.

Symptoms of this disease are similar to flu, which may make its recognition difficult, given that the symptoms are composed of muscle pain, fever, migraine headache, cough, nausea or vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain [It is curious that no mention is made of respiratory or cardiac difficulties that are major components of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. - Mod.TY].

[Although the specific hantavirus involved in this case of HPS is not specified, it occurred in the Andean foothill region so most likely is Andes virus. Andes virus is the only hantavirus shown thus far to be transmitted directly from person to person, but only rarely, and among individuals in very close contact. Most infections are acquired from contact with excrement of infected rodents. Andes virus occurs in western Argentina, harbored by the long-tailed pygmy rice rat reservoir host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_, can be seen at http://www.hantavirus.cl/educacion_prevencion/galeria_reservorio/oligoryzomys_longicaudatus.jpg.
