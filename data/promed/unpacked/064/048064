Health officials are trying to locate all those who came into contact with 2 cattle suspected as being the source. 5 people are being monitored for anthrax symptoms after Hungarian officials reported that the deadly disease has been found in beef.

The country's health authority, ANTSZ, said the disease -- usually caused by bacteria that live in soil -- was identified in frozen meat. It is thought to have come from 2 cattle from a farm in the eastern Hungarian town of Tiszafured [Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok county]. The animals had been illegally slaughtered, officials said. The 5 people currently in hospital are suspected to have been infected during the slaughter process.

Some of the beef was shipped to a firm that runs canteens. The caterer has been told to stay closed while the investigation continues.

ANTSZ said it was trying to find out if anyone else had come into contact with either the cattle thought to have been carrying the disease or the meat. It advised the public that the disease can be cured with antibiotics, if identified in time. Vaccination of other animals that could have been exposed to anthrax is also under way.

An ANTSZ statement said: "Authorities have taken the necessary measures, so there is no longer an immediate danger."

[Essentially identical reports have been made by other news services, presumably from the same official news release:

https://news.yahoo.com/five-people-hungary-monitored-suspected-anthrax-infection-073237978--sector.html

To find Tiszafured, go to: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiszaf%C3%BCred. This is in Jasz-Nagykun-Szolnok county, which has suffered singular sporadic outbreaks in sheep in 2009 (9 sheep affected) and 2013 (6 affected). As a threshold number of sheep have to be dead before the owner will contact his veterinarian, we can assume that outbreaks limited to 1-2 sheep are not being reported. This infrequency can result in mistaken and missed diagnoses and regrettable behaviour. Hopefully this "frozen meat" event will result in some more proactive surveillance and vaccination.
