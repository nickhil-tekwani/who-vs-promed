Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever in Uganda - Who Update 35
-------------------------------------------------
As of Tue 19 Dec 2000, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported
cumulative figures for all affected districts of 421 confirmed cases,
including 162 deaths.
Case management, surveillance and tracing of contacts and health education
measures will be ongoing during the coming holiday season. Rotation of
staff is in progress and a WHO team from Headquarters will be replacing
staff currently in Gulu and Masindi.
Several other organizations are carrying out these activities with the
Ugandan Ministry of Health, Ugandan Local Government Officials and Ugandan
People's Defense Forces, including US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, Medecins sans Frontieres - International, Istituto Superiore di
Sanita (ISS, Italy) and HealthCanada. Public health professionals from
Japan and the United Kingdom are also supporting these efforts.
WHO recommends no special restrictions on travel or trade to or from Uganda.

[Since the last WHO Update reported on Fri 8 Dec 2000, there have been 16
additional confirmed cases and 2 deaths. These data suggest that the
outbreak is being contained and that it remains confined to the Gulu and
Masindi areas. However, it is still far from extinguished and the coming
holiday period may be a critical time. The fatality rate is now 38.5 per
cent. - Mod.CP
