The possibility that these deaths are due to delayed contamination of the
rivers by a previously released chemical weapon is certainly interesting,
and the details of the deaths, though sketchy, are not inconsistent with
nerve agent poisoning, especially considering the reports of paralysis,
vomiting and rapid death within minutes. The fact that the chickens fed
the suspect fish also died within minutes points to the fish as the
probable source of the poisoning. But all these rapid deaths beg the
question of why didn't the fish die within minutes of their first exposure.
I'm not a fish biologist and perhaps they are more resistant to this type
of poison, or perhaps they were exposed to continuously low concentrations
that accumulated in their flesh. I would also like to suggest that this
could be organophosphate pesticide poisoning. I recall last year there was
a problem in Africa where renegade fishermen were dumping pesticides into
the water to quickly kill and catch the fish. I wonder if the same
mechanism is at work here.

[Tetrodotoxin and possibly saxitoxin can mimic nerve agents. However, in an
aqueous environment, Nerve agents and organophosphates would hydrolyze.
Therefore, it is not one of these agents unless it is massive amounts
applied very recently, as with the African fish poisonings -- certainly not
with agents applied since 1991. The natural fruit mentioned may still be a
possibility.
Tetrodotoxin and Saxitoxin are 2 of the most potent poisons known, the
minimal lethal dose of each in the mouse is about 8 micrograms per
kilogram. Both toxins are responsible for outbreaks of fatal poisoning in
man.
Although the toxins are chemically different from each other, their
mechanism of action seems identical. Both toxins, in nanomolar
concentrations, specifically block the sodium channels in the membranes of
excitable cells. Both toxins case death by paralysis of the respiratory
muscles. The treatment of severe cases of poisoning therefore requires
artificial ventilation..
Saxitoxin and possibly some related toxins are elaborated by some of the
dinoflagellates and can be retained in tissues of some shellfish.
Saxitoxin is an agent poorly regulated, easily obtained and has been
investigated as a BT agent. Furthermore because it is easily acquired,
manufactured and distributed, mimicking other agents, such as nerve agents,
the diagnosis is often missed. - Mod.TG
