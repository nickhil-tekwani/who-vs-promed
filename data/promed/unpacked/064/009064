A mass poisoning among indigenous Cubeos [ethnic group of the Colombian Amazon] after drinking "chicha" [a homemade fermented drink] has so far left one person dead and 10 more in critical condition.

The incident occurred in the village of La Reforma, located 4 hours from the urban center of the municipality of Calamar, Guaviare Department [southern central region of Colombia].

According to information provided by the local mayor, Giovany Garces, the indigenous settlement captain reported that apparently the situation resulted from drinking chicha prepared with bananas that had been sprayed while controlling illicit crops and that the Cubeos did not want to waste.

Aggravating the situation are the lack of communication and armed clashes in the area as well as the fact that there is no health center nearby. The fastest access route is the river Unilla and only a few minutes ago [Sun 15 Jan 2012] the mayor of Calamar coordinated for a doctor and an assistant to be transferred by boat to the settlement in order to provide first aid and bring the poisoned persons to the municipal hospital. The procedure is expected to take at least 8 hours.

[According to an article from Diario La Nacion (http://www.lanacion.com.ve/noticias.php?IdArticulo=197541 (in Spanish) dated 16 Jan 2012, on 11 Jan 2011 national police aircraft responsible for the eradication of illicit crops sprayed glyphosate on coca plantations near the Cubeo settlement, also contaminating their food crops, including the bananas used to prepare the beverage.

Glyphosate is generally regarded as one of the safe herbicides. However, dose always makes the poison. Glyphosate is supplied in several formulations for different uses: ammonium salt, isopropyl amine salt, glyphosate acid - standalone, as ammonium salt or as isopropyl salt, and potassium salt. Glyphosate has been used by the United States, in coordination with other countries, in aerial spraying of drug related crops, especially coca.

Ingestion of this herbicide demonstrates that greater than 85 mL being ingested produces an illness and sometimes death. It is difficult to believe that these individuals ingested 85 mL or more of the chemical from this banana drink. Even in a fermented drink a high level of the chemical should have given a most unpleasant taste and throat irritation.

Inebriation may have played some role, but the 1st few mouthfuls of the drink should have stopped anybody.

Hopefully medical care will reach the affected individuals and treatment will be a success. - Mod.TG
