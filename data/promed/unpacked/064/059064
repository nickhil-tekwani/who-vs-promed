[ref: L Svanella-Dumas, et al. 1st Report of the Presence of _Plum pox virus_ Rec Strain in France. Plant Disease 2015; 9:, 421; DOI: 10.1094/PDIS-07-14-0763-PDN]
-----------------------------------
_Plum pox virus_ (PPV) is the most detrimental virus in stone fruit crops (_Prunus_ spp.). At least 9 monophyletic PPV strains are recognized, 3 of which, PPV-D, PPV-M, and PPV-Rec, have broad distributions. PPV-Rec is characterized by a unique founding recombination event and has been reported mostly from Central and South-Central Europe. It is poorly adapted to peach, and the weak and transient symptoms it causes on peach seedling indicators may complicate its biological detection.

During surveys in the Alsace region of France in spring 2013, a plum orchard with trees (_Prunus domestica_ cv. Quetsche d'Alsace) showing dubious leaf symptoms possibly reminiscent of PPV infection was identified. Testing by ELISA gave clear positive reactions, putting the overall infection rate of the orchard at 6.25 per cent, while a 2nd nearby orchard was found infected at a rate of 0.8 per cent.

The presence of PPV was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specific for the Rec and M strains. Sequencing provided clear identification of the Rec strain with 98.7 to 97.7 per cent identity with a range of PPV Rec isolates mostly originating from the Balkans. PPV-Rec was also confirmed by strain-specific reverse-transcription-PCR.

This is, to our knowledge, the 1st report of PPV-Rec in France. This finding is worrisome given that PPV-Rec is considered well adapted to plum, the most important _Prunus_ crop in Alsace. Further surveillance in Alsace during 2014 failed to provide evidence for the presence of PPV-Rec in other areas away from the initial infection focus, which is currently undergoing eradication efforts.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus) has been reported from Europe, parts of Asia, northern Africa and the Americas, but is still absent from Australia and New Zealand. It affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to 100 per cent yield loss in stone fruit crops. Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible, including hops, pea, tomato and a number of weedy annual plants. Symptoms on _Prunus_ species can occur on leaves and fruit. They may include ring or line patterns, mottling, distortion, and can lead to premature fruit drop and shoot dieback. Infection may be symptomless in some host species. PPV isolates have been grouped into strains, some of which do not infect certain _Prunus_ species.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical means (such as orchard tools) and grafting, as well as by infected propagation and other plant material. It may be seed transmitted in some host species but is not known to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still being debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is difficult but may include control of the vector insects, removal of virus reservoirs and use of certified planting and grafting material. For some PPV strains, resistant cultivars are available in several types of stone fruits. Specific molecular tests have been developed to distinguish viral strains.
