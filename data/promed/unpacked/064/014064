[1] Omicron subvariant BF.7 spreading in China
Date: Fri 16 Dec 2022
Source: Live Science [edited]
https://www.livescience.com/covid-what-we-know-about-new-omicron-variant-bf-7


Since the COVID variant omicron emerged in late 2021, it has rapidly evolved into multiple subvariants. One subvariant, BF.7, has recently been identified as the main variant spreading in Beijing, and is contributing to a wider surge of COVID infections in China.

But what is this new variant, and should we be worried? Although reports from China about this variant's characteristics are concerning, it doesn't appear to be growing too much elsewhere in the world. Here's what we know.

BF.7, short for BA.5.2.1.7, is a sub-lineage of the omicron variant BA.5.

Reports from China indicate BF.7 has the strongest infection ability out of the omicron subvariants in the country, being quicker to transmit than other variants, having a shorter incubation period, and with greater capacity to infect people who have had a previous COVID infection, or been vaccinated, or both.

To put this into context, BF.7 is believed to have an R0, or basic reproduction number, of 10 to 18.6. This means an infected person will transmit the virus to an average of 10 to 18.6 other people. Research has shown omicron has an average R0 of 5.08.

The high transmission rate of BF.7, taken with the risk of hidden spread due to the many asymptomatic carriers, is understood to be causing significant difficulty in controlling the epidemic in China.

The symptoms of an infection with BF.7 are similar to those associated with other omicron subvariants, primarily upper respiratory symptoms. Patients may have a fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose and fatigue, among other symptoms. A minority of people can also experience gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and diarrhoea.

BF.7 may well cause more serious illness in people with weaker immune systems.

BF.7's mutations
----------------
As omicron has evolved, we've seen the emergence of new subvariants better able to escape immunity from vaccination or prior infection. BF.7 is no different.

BF.7 carries a specific mutation, R346T, in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (a protein on the surface of the virus that allows it to attach to and infect our cells). This mutation, which we also see in BF.7's "parent" variant BA.5, has been linked with enhancing the capacity of the virus to escape neutralising antibodies generated by vaccines or previous infection.

A recent study examined the neutralisation of BF.7 in sera (a component of blood that should contain antibodies) from triple-vaccinated healthcare workers, as well as patients infected during the omicron BA.1 and BA.5 waves of the pandemic. BF.7 was resistant to neutralisation, driven partly by the R346T mutation.

BF.7 around the world
---------------------
BF.7 has been detected in several other countries around the world including India, the U.S., the U.K. and several European countries such as Belgium, Germany, France and Denmark.

Despite BF.7's immune-evasive characteristics, and worrying signs about its growth in China, the variant seems to be remaining fairly steady elsewhere. For example, in the U.S. it was estimated to account for 5.7% of infections up to 10 Dec 2022, down from 6.6% the week prior.

While the U.K. Health Security Agency identified BF.7 as one of the most concerning variants in terms of both growth and neutralisation data in a technical briefing published in October [2022] (it accounted for over 7% of cases at that time), the most recent briefing says BF.7 has been de-escalated due to reduced incidence and low growth rates in the U.K.

We don't know exactly why the situation looks different in China. BF.7's high R0 might be due in part to a low level of immunity in the Chinese population from previous infection, and possibly vaccination too. We should, of course, be cautious about the data from China as it's based on reports, not peer-reviewed evidence yet.

An evolving virus
-----------------
Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 3 years ago [2019], the virus has continued to evolve, acquiring genetic mutations more rapidly than expected.

The emergence of BF.7 and other new variants is concerning. But vaccination is still the best weapon we have to fight COVID. And the recent approval by the U.K. drugs regulator of bivalent boosters, which target omicron alongside the original strain of SARS-CoV-2, is very promising.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Bivalent mRNA COVID-19 booster doses containing an omicron BA.4/BA.5 sublineage component were recommended on 1 Sep 2022. The effectiveness of these updated vaccines against COVID-19-associated medical encounters has not been established.

What is added by this report?
Bivalent booster doses provided additional protection against COVID-19-associated emergency department/urgent care encounters and hospitalizations in persons who previously received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses. Because of waning of monovalent vaccine-conferred immunity, relative effectiveness of bivalent vaccines was higher with increased time since the previous monovalent dose.

What are the implications for public health practice?
All persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, including receiving a bivalent booster dose if eligible.

[3] Shanghai: COVID-19 case surge
Date: Thu 22 Dec 2022
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-cities-give-out-free-fever-drugs-covid-flares-2022-12-22/


A Shanghai hospital has told its staff to prepare for a "tragic battle" with COVID-19 as it expects half of the city's 25 million people will get infected by the end of next week, while the virus sweeps through China largely unchecked.

After widespread protests against strict mitigation measures, China this month [December 2022] began dismantling its "zero-COVID" regime, which had taken a great financial and psychological toll on its 1.4 billion people.

China's official death count since the pandemic began 3 years ago [2029] stands at 5241 -- a fraction of what most other countries faced -- but now looks bound to rise sharply.

China reported no new COVID deaths for a 2nd consecutive day for Wednesday [21 Dec 2022], even as funeral parlour workers say demand for their services has increased sharply over the past week.

Authorities -- who have narrowed the criteria for COVID deaths, prompting criticism from many disease experts -- confirmed 389 306 cases with symptoms.

Some experts say official case figures have become an unreliable guide as less testing is being done following the easing of restrictions.

Infections in China are likely to be more than a million a day with deaths at more than 5000 a day, a "stark contrast" from official data, British-based health data firm Airfinity said this week.

Airfinity said it examined data from China's regional provinces, noting that cases are rising quicker in capital Beijing and southern province Guangdong.

The Shanghai Deji Hospital, posting on its WeChat account late on Wednesday [21 Dec 2022], estimated there were about 5.43 million positives in the city and that 12.5 million in China's main commercial hub will get infected by the end of the year [2022].

"This year's [2022] Christmas Eve, New Year's Day, and the Lunar New Year are destined to be unsafe," said the private hospital, which employs some 400 staff.

"In this tragic battle, the entire Greater Shanghai will fall, and we will infect all the staff of the hospital! We will infect the whole family! Our patients will all be infected! We have no choice, and we cannot escape."

The post was no longer available on WeChat by Thursday afternoon [22 Dec 2022]. A person who answered the hospital's main telephone line said they could not immediately comment on the article.

Shanghai residents endured a 2-month lockdown that ended on 1 Jun 2022, with many losing income and struggling to find basic necessities. Hundreds died and hundreds of thousands were infected during those 2 months [April and May 2022].

On Thursday [22 Dec 2022], many areas of Shanghai were almost as deserted as back then, with many residents isolating themselves and businesses forced to shut as staff fell ill.

"All our employees are sick," said a supermarket worker surnamed Wang as he was shutting the doors. He said he hoped to re-open on 30 Dec 2022.

Despite the new infections, the last vestiges of the "COVID Zero" policy are being scrapped. China plans to cut quarantine requirements for overseas travellers in January [2023], Bloomberg News reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

Experts say China could face more than a million COVID deaths next year [2023], given relatively low full vaccination rates among its vulnerable elderly population.

China's vaccination rate is over 90% but the rate for adults who have received booster shots drops to 57.9%, and to 42.3% for people aged 80 and above, government data shows.

Footage from a Beijing hospital on CCTV state television showed rows of elderly patients in the intensive care unit breathing through oxygen masks. It was not clear how many of them had COVID.

The deputy director of the hospital's emergency department, Han Xue, told CCTV they were receiving 400 patients a day, 4 times more than usual.

"These patients are all elderly people who have underlying diseases, fever and respiratory infection, and they are in a very serious condition," Han said.

The head of the World Health Organization said it was concerned about the spike in infections and was supporting the government to focus on vaccinating those at the highest risk.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters the agency needed more detailed information on disease severity, hospital admissions and requirements for intensive care units for a comprehensive assessment.

China's policy U-turn caught a fragile health system unprepared, with hospitals scrambling for beds and blood, pharmacies for drugs and authorities racing to build clinics.

Smaller cities away from the affluent coastal belt are particularly vulnerable. Tongchuan, a city of 700 000 in the northwestern province of Shaanxi, called on Wednesday [21 Dec 2022] for all medical workers who retired in the past 5 years to join the battle against COVID.

State media said local governments were trying to tackle drug shortages, while pharmaceutical companies were working over-time to boost supplies.

Germany said it has sent its 1st batch of BioNTech COVID vaccines to China to be administered initially to German expatriates. Berlin is pushing for other foreign nationals to be allowed to take them.

BioNTech said on Thursday [22 Dec 2022] it had shipped 11 500 doses of the vaccine to China.

These would be the 1st mRNA vaccines, seen as most efficient against the disease, available in China.

The German embassy in Beijing has asked its nationals to register to get the vaccine, which should soon be available at its diplomatic missions. China's foreign ministry said both sides were discussing how to arrange distribution of the vaccine to Germans.

China has 9 domestically developed COVID vaccines approved for use.

[4] China: Nearly 37 million infected this week
Date: Fri 23 Dec 2022
Source: Hindustan Times [edited]
https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-in-china-news-coronavirus-in-china-china-estimates-37-million-people-had-covid-in-a-single-day-world-s-largest-101671792650067.html


Nearly 37 million people in China may have been infected with COVID on a single day this week, according to estimates from the government's top health authority. This makes the country's outbreak by far the world's largest as almost 248 million people, or nearly 18% of the population, have likely contracted the virus in the 1st 20 days of December [2022].

If accurate, the infection rate could be much higher than the previous daily record of about 4 million, set in January 2022, according to minutes from an internal meeting of China's National Health Commission (NHC), Bloomberg reported.

This comes following Beijing's swift dismantling of COVID Zero restrictions which has led to the spread of the highly contagious omicron variants. More than half the residents of Sichuan province, in China's southwest, and the capital Beijing have been infected, agency's estimates showed. However, the process of estimating the number remained unclear.

There was no estimate made on how many people have died due to COVID but the minutes cited Ma Xiaowei, the head of the NHC, reiterating the narrower definition used to count COVID fatalities, Bloomberg reported.

Officials said Beijing is starting to see severe and critical COVID cases peak even as its overall infection rate is waning. Meanwhile, the outbreak is spreading from urban centers to rural China as the agency warned every region to prepare for the coming surge in severe disease.

The 37 million daily cases estimated for 20 Dec 2022 also marks a dramatic deviation from the official tally of just 3049 infections reported in China for that day. It is also several times higher than the previous world record for the pandemic. Global cases hit an all-time high of 4 million on 19 Jan 2022, amid a wave of omicron infections following its emergence in South Africa.
