WHOI Scientists Monitor Largest Red Tide Outbreak in 12 Years in
Massachusetts Bay
-------------------------------------------------
Woods Hole Center for Oceans and Human Health cruise provided timely data
for shellfish managers, including maps of _Alexandrium fundyense_ cell
concentrations in the coastal waters of the Gulf of Maine. The top map
shows actual cell counts per liter of seawater taken 10-16 May 2005, with
dots representing sampling locations. The bottom map shows counts taken May
17-18 in a focused survey area around Cape Ann. Cells within Massachusetts
Bay and just to the north doubled in just a few days.

With shellfish beds from Maine to the Cape Cod coast closed from the
largest outbreak of red tide in 12 years in Massachusetts Bay, scientists
from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) are studying the algae
that causes these red tides and providing information to coastal managers
using new molecular techniques and oceanographic models.

After a recent research cruise in which the extent of the bloom was
revealed, the WHOI team will head to sea again Memorial Day weekend to
continue monitoring the outbreak and sample areas throughout the Bay,
including waters in Cape Cod Bay that rarely become toxic, but which are
closed to shellfishing in some areas because of this bloom. Their data will
again be shared with state officials and local shellfish managers, given
the significant public health concerns from this bloom. Shellfish
contaminated with the red tide toxin, if eaten in sufficient quantity, can
cause illness or death -- a poisoning syndrome called paralytic shellfish
poisoning, or PSP.

The noreaster May 7 and 8 off the New England coast was the perfect storm
in terms of Massachusetts Bay red tide outbreaks, said WHOI Biologist and
Senior Scientist Don Anderson, who has studied red tides and other harmful
algal blooms for decades and is co-chief scientist of the current project.

"All the conditions were right for a major outbreak of _Alexandrium
fundyense_, the predominant red tide species in the Gulf of Maine. We've
seen patches of red tide cells at the entrance to Massachusetts Bay just
south of Cape Ann on other occasions, but often the winds and circulation
patterns take them offshore. This time, we had high cell concentrations to
the north, evidenced by very high levels of toxicity along the NH coast,
and then the unusual winds and currents brought them into the Bay, where we
found them in a broad distribution from Cape Ann to Stellwagen Bank."
As luck would have it, a WHOI team headed by Associate Scientist Dennis
McGillicuddy and Anderson had a long-planned research cruise May 9-18 in
the Gulf of Maine and Massachusetts Bay as a project for the Woods Hole
Center for Oceans and Human Health (COHH). The cruise aboard
the Institution's research vessel Oceanus was the first in a 5-year COHH
study of harmful algal blooms and their genetic diversity across the Gulf
of Maine. The team on Oceanus began collecting samples in the Bay about 2
a.m. on May 10 right after the noreaster had passed through and immediately
saw cells -- more cells than expected.
"The cell counts we're getting are the highest they've been since the late
1980s," reported Bruce Keafer, leader of the at-sea Alexandrium sampling
effort. Through daily email and cell phone contact with Anderson and state
officials, the team relayed their cells counts so they could be compared
with toxicity readings ashore.
As his colleagues continued sampling to the north for Alexandrium cells,
eventually reaching the Bay of Fundy, Anderson worked with state officials,
who were anxious for information on the nature of the outbreak, given the
need to protect public health through timely shellfish harvesting
closures. Anderson heads the U.S. National Office for Marine Biotoxins and
Harmful Algal Blooms and is director of the Institution's Coastal Ocean
Institute.
McGillicuddy, an Associate Scientist in the WHOI Applied Ocean Physics and
Engineering Department, combined the biological observations from the
cruise with ocean conditions into a computer model to help investigate
these events. As the team measured ocean currents during the Oceanus
cruise and incorporated that information into the model, other data was
being received from a series of instrumented buoys from the Gulf of Maine
Ocean Observing System (GoMOOS). By combining the cell counts and
oceanographic and meteorological conditions, McGillicuddy's team was able
to quickly map the extent of the red tide bloom, continually updating the
model as new data was received.
The Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries and other state agencies
monitor Massachusetts Bay shellfish for annual red tide outbreaks. In
2005, these agencies were alerted to the possibility of Massachusetts Bay
toxicity, given the patterns of toxicity in western Maine and New
Hampshire. What they didn't know until the WHOI cruise was the extent of
the outbreak and how abundant the toxic cells were.
The WHOI team filled in some of the information gaps by collecting samples
at 160 stations along a series of transects from the coast offshore from
Massachusetts Bay north to the Bay of Fundy, taking samples at 3 different
water depths at each station. Samples were then quickly analyzed in the
ship's laboratory under a microscope for visual identification and live red
tide cells were counted. Using a novel method called a sandwich
hybridization assay to unequivocally identify and count the _Alexandrium
fundyense_ cells, the shipboard team confirmed that toxic cells were indeed
present in the Bay and in waters to the immediate north.
Simultaneously, Anderson and his research team ashore were helping to map
the toxic cell distribution with a different method they had developed
several years ago for rapid cell identification and enumeration. Funding to
develop this method, known as whole cell hybridization, was provided by the
NOAA National Ocean Service's Center for Sponsored Coastal Ocean Research
(CSCOR). In the past, it would have taken weeks or even months to count the
many samples that were coming ashore, but with the new method, the maps of
cell abundance were available in 1-2 days. This information was of direct
value to health officials, who otherwise would have had to make difficult
decisions about possible shellfish closures based only on the toxin levels
measured in the shellfish.
Knowledge of the widespread distribution and high abundance of the bloom
convinced officials to err on the safe side and close the shellfish beds
quickly and expand their sampling into areas that are not typically monitored.
"Using the information from sea and this new technique, we were able to map
out the distribution of _Alexandrium fundyense_ within a very short time,"
Anderson said. "This is the type of information shellfish managers need
quickly so they can make informed decisions."
"The current bloom is big, much larger in fact than the last outbreak in
the Bay 12 years ago, and much more widespread," added Anderson. "This is
an unusual event."
The reasons why are unclear. Both Anderson and McGillicuddy say the
current outbreak could reflect a number of factors. They include the
"perfect storm" idea, in which all the conditions were right to introduce
cells into the Bay from the north, but also point out that there may be
more cysts of Alexandrium in the western Gulf of Maine sediments than in
the past as a result of a major red tide bloom last fall. Cysts remain
dormant in sediments until conditions are favorable for germination and
growth, leading to a bloom in subsequent years. Another possibility is
that there is more fresh water entering the coast of the Gulf of Maine this
year than has been the case for over a decade, reflecting the abundant
rainfall this spring and the heavy snowfall over the winter. This fresh
water provides the hydrographic conditions that can lead to optimum growth
of Alexandrium cells.
The scientists may get more answers when they head to sea again this
weekend. This time the WHOI researchers will use the Institution's new
60-foot coastal vessel Tioga, designed for rapid response to such
events. They plan to revisit some of the same sites and resample, as well
as fill in the gaps by mapping and sampling areas further to the south into
Cape Cod Bay to see how far the bloom has penetrated.
Toxicity has already been detected in shellfish in Sandwich on Cape Cod for
the 1st time since the last major red tide outbreak in 1993. The WHOI
efforts will be part of a coordinated sampling program involving the
Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries, the Center for Coastal
Studies in Provincetown, and other agencies.
NOAA's CSCOR program is helping again, this time by providing the rapid
response funds for McGillicuddy and team to get out into the Bay to sample
directly after another noreaster passes through the region. What the next
storm will do to the conditions and how it will affect the bloom is unknown.
Anderson says the ability to respond rapidly to these outbreaks, to collect
and share data quickly with state agencies and local officials, is the wave
of the future. "This project is a great example of how some of the new
technologies we are developing can help these groups work together to meet
a societal need."
He says he expects to see automated instruments on buoys at sea in the
future, collecting information and relaying it ashore, where it can then be
used in numerical models to make forecasts -- a huge technological step
forward in red tide research. The sandwich hybridization technique that
they used on board Oceanus can be run in automated fashion inside moored
instruments in these observatory arrays, providing early warning of red
tide cells and toxins.
Despite the shellfish closures, the public should not be afraid to eat
shellfish, as the states have very good monitoring programs,Anderson said.
"People should just be aware of and observe the signs posted at areas
closed to shell fishing. If they are going to harvest shellfish, check
with their local officials for the latest information."
Long after this bloom has dissipated, Anderson and McGillicuddy plan to
conduct a series of sampling cruises in 2007 as part of the 5-year COHH
program in the Gulf of Maine and Massachusetts Bay. PSP has long been a
problem in the region, and is not expected to disappear any time soon. The
Woods Hole COHH, which McGillicuddy serves as deputy director, is one of 4
such centers in the nation funded by the National Science Foundation and
the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), one of the
National Institutes of Health. Scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution (WHOI), Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) formed the Woods Hole Center
for Oceans and Human Health (COHH) in 2003.
With administrative offices at WHOI, the Woods Hole COHH serves as a focal
point for research on issues at the intersection of oceanographic,
biological and environmental health sciences, such as red tides, harmful
algal blooms and other organisms in coastal waters and estuaries that cause
human illness and death.
