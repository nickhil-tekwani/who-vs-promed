The female Arizona case with a flu-like illness was also tested for presumed "hepatitis", suggesting she suffered from hepatic involvement with elevated transaminases [see Hantavirus - Americas (13): USA (AZ), Panama (LS) 20180301.5657531].

The HFRS [hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome] form with the most marked hepatic involvement, even superseding often the renal involvement, is the rat-induced Seoul virus (SEOV) HFRS, as noted before in Korea, China, Japan, Hong-Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and in fact in the whole of South East Asia, where the wild rat is the predominant rodent reservoir, carrying a pathogenic hantavirus species. However, wild rats are found everywhere, including in the USA, where persistent SEOV infection in the local rat population is confirmed in a few follow-up studies in port cities like New Orleans and Baltimore.

Apparently, pulmonary involvement in this case was so mild that a hospitalization was not considered necessary. Initial shortness of breath, not progressing to hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome, is a symptom sometimes encountered shortly before or after admission for virtually all HFRS forms and is not diagnostic per se for HCPS proper. It was also present in the 1st bio-molecularly confirmed SEOV-HFRS cases in the USA, who were even ventilated during 2 days in the ICU for an initially presumed HCPS, see: Woods C, Palekar R, Kim P, et al. Domestically acquired Seoul virus causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome--Maryland, 2008. Clin Infect Dis 2009;49:e109-12. https://doi.org/10.1086/644742.

SEOV-HFRS, like all other HFRS forms, is initially characterized by often massive proteinuria, disappearing rapidly within 2-3 weeks and nowadays ascribed to self-restoring "podocyte injury", giving typical "podocyte foot processes effacement" on renal biopsy EM microscopy. Thus, lowering degrees of proteinuria, together with microscopic haematuria, both easily obtainable by the GP at house, could confirm a prior SEOV-HFRS, rather than a prior HCPS in this Arizona case.

Finally, and as also illustrated in the cited CID 2009 publication above, most current commercial ELISA kits in the USA and in Europe do (regrettably) not contain a specific SEOV screening antigen or contain a nucleocapsid protein common to all hantaviruses, a feature considered optimal for broad screening purposes. However, in practice, this means that the involved SEOV infection can eventually be missed, even if serologic evidence of a recent hantavirus infection has been found.

[ProMED-mail again thanks Dr Clement for sending in his thoughtful comments.

Dr Clement raises an interesting possibility concerning the hantavirus etiology involved in this Arizona case. One tends to think of SEOV in the USA as having coastal distribution, not in a land-locked state like Arizona. However, the common SEOV host, the brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), is widely distributed across the contiguous USA states, so there is no reason not to consider SEOV in these situations. As Dr Clement points out, the available ELISA kits do not differentiate SEOV from other hantaviruses, making one wonder whether SEOV infections are under-diagnosed frequently in the USA.
