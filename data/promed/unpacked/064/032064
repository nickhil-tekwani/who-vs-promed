Protection from Disease versus Susceptibility to Infection
----------------------------------------------------------
I think it is very important to distinguish between protection from disease
versus susceptibility to infection. The ability to be infected will be
essentially inversely correlated with the presence of circulating and
pulmonary neutralizing antibody. It is highly likely that those of us who
were vaccinated have very diminished titers of antibody. However, vaccinia
virus-specific T cells are the critical component of recovery, and
previously vaccinated adults are replete with circulating memory T cells
which will rapidly expand and eliminate smallpox [_Variola virus_.
Therefore, it is very unlikely that disease will be manifest. An increase
in serum antibody titer shortly after inapparent infection is what I predict.
Another point. A friend (Solomon L. Mowshowitz, PhD) made this suggestion.
If there is a limited vaccine supply, within days of scarifying one member
of a family, the virus could be harvested from the site and transferred to
others, sequentially. The caveats about transmissible infectious diseases
(for instance HCV, HBV) are a concern, and of course no immunocompromised
individual should receive the vaccine.

A Comment on Risk
-----------------
It should be considered that smallpox vaccination in adults not
[previously vaccinated may result in severe complications. According to
previous experience PVE [postvaccinial encephalitis may occur in 1:10 000
for ages 1-3 years,1:650 for ages 4-5 years, and 1:120 for ages 11-14 years.
Therefore attenuated strains [of vaccinia virus, as for instance P
(Posthuma) D (Dekking) N (van der Noordaa) vaccine, possibly under the
protection of specific anti-vaccinial immunoglobulin, should be preferred.

The Interpretation of Scab Formation
------------------------------------
Many of these e-mails have indicated that the formation of a scab upon
re-vaccination equates to prior susceptibility; while, the lack of same
equates to immunity. What is the status of someone who was vaccinated
multiple times and NEVER developed a scab or scar? Some of the literature
indicates a natural immunity and some indicates no immunity.
