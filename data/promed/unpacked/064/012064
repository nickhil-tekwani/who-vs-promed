[1] Role of bats in emergence

Genomic analysis suggests that the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV] circulated among bats for a while before jumping to humans.

Middle East respiratory syndrome has killed 58 humans since the MERS coronavirus was first detected in 2012 -- a mortality rate of nearly 50 percent. Researchers have suspected that bats and camels were the source of the virus, and new data published today (10 Oct 2013) in Virology Journal add weight to the former as the original reservoir of the disease.

"Our analysis suggests that an evolutionary lineage leading to the current MERS-CoV co-evolved with bat hosts for an extended time period, eventually jumping species boundaries to infect humans, perhaps through an intermediate host," Jie Cui, the lead author of the paper and an evolutionary virologist at the University of Sydney in Australia, said in a press release.

Cui and his colleagues scrutinized the mRNA sequences of the cell surface receptor, DPP4, which [MERS-CoV] uses to break into the host cell. They found a higher ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous nucleotide substitutions among the sequences of DPP4 from 5 bat species compared to DPP4 sequences in nearly all of the 27 other mammals analysed -- an indication of adaptive evolution, possibly to escape entry by [MERS-CoV]. The findings "accord with the growing body of data that the newly emerged MERS-CoV ultimately has a bat-origin," the authors wrote in their report.

An upcoming concern regarding MERS is next week's massive Hajj in Mecca and Madinah [13-18 Oct 2013], which can draw millions of pilgrims. Most of the MERS deaths have been in Saudi Arabia.

The authors' Provisional Abstract states the following:
"The newly emerged Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that first appeared in Saudi Arabia during the summer of 2012 has to date (20 Sep 2013) caused 58 human deaths. MERS-CoV utilizes the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) host cell receptor, and analysis of the long-term interaction between virus and receptor provides key information on the evolutionary events that lead to the viral emergence. The authors show that bat DPP4 receptor genes have been subject to significant adaptive evolution, suggestive of a long-term arms-race between bats and MERS related CoVs. In particular, we identify 3 positively selected residues in DPP4 that directly interact with the viral surface glycoprotein."

The authors' findings suggest that the evolutionary lineage leading to MERS-CoV may have circulated in bats for a substantial time period. The authors' data do not unequivocally identify a particular bat species as a vector of MERS-CoV, but their results are consistent with a prediction that bats are a likely intermediary in the evolution of the human pathogen. - Mod.CP]

Within the framework of the constant monitoring and epidemic surveillance of the novel coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the Ministry of Health (MOH) has announced 2 new fatal cases have been recorded in the Riyadh region.

The 1st case is a 78-year-old male citizen, who had been suffering from chronic diseases.

The 2nd case is a 55-year-old male citizen, who also had been suffering from diseases.

[According to the Saudi Arabian MOH website, there have been 119 cases of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in Saudi Arabia including 51 deaths. As of the last global total reported on the WHO Global alert and response website on 4 Oct 2013, there had been a total of 136 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 58 deaths. The addition of these 2 newly reported fatal cases will raise this global total to 138 laboratory confirmed cases including 60 deaths.
