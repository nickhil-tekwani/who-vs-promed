Oxfam International said on Tuesday [10 Mar 2020], that Yemen is currently suffering from a forgotten cholera crisis, and warned of the high number of people infected with the disease with the approaching rainy season next April, while health care systems are on the verge of collapse.

The organization said, in a statement, that the outbreak of the epidemic in 2019 is the 2nd ever on a global scale, and cases are still increasing, referring to the announcement of a high cholera rate in Sanaa, Hajjah, Hodeidah, Taiz and Dhamar since 2017.

It noted that more than 56 000 suspected cases have already been recorded in the first 7 weeks of 2020, roughly equal to the same period in 2019. "The number of cases of cholera in 2019 was the 2nd largest ever recorded in a country in a single year, surpassed only by the numbers in Yemen in 2017," it added.

The organization confirmed that the prolonged, consistent nature of new cases over the last 14 months shows the disease is still rampant in Yemen. "The outlook is bleak for people in Yemen with cholera continuing at similar levels to last year [2019] and the rainy season likely to see thousands more people infected," Muhsin Siddiquey, Oxfam's Yemen Country Director said. "This is a health crisis hiding in plain sight. It's shocking that this ongoing crisis is getting so little attention. A lack of clean water and food has left many people weak and vulnerable to disease, and yet aid agencies are struggling to reach those most in need because of access constraints imposed by all sides," Siddiquey added. "We need urgent action from the international community to ensure safe, secure and unimpeded access for humanitarian aid and to bring the parties together to agree a nationwide ceasefire."

The number of deaths from cholera in 2019 dropped to 1025 - less than half the number of fatalities in 2017. But efforts to definitively beat the disease have been massively undermined by the war, which has decimated health, water and sanitation systems. Medical supplies are in chronically short supply and only around half the health facilities in Yemen are fully functioning. Fluctuating exchange rates have pushed up the price of diesel, in turn increasing the price of trucking clean water to parts of the country where groundwater is unavailable. More than 17 million people struggle to get clean water.

"The humanitarian crisis in Yemen is entirely man-made and those who continue to arm all sides in this war bear responsibility for its devastating consequences," Siddiquey said.

[The epidemic of reported cholera in war-torn Yemen continues. The calculated case fatality rate from this is quite low, strongly suggesting that many of the cases are not cholera. Even with that, the numbers reported in this continuing catastrophe are difficult to wrap one's head around. - Mod.LL]

[2] Cholera - India (Karnataka State)

A total of 6 cases of cholera have been recorded in the BBMP [Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palik] limits in the past week, raising concerns about drinking water safety. The city [Bengaluru, capital city of Karnataka state] is also witnessing an increase in gastrointestinal infections. While 3 cases have been reported from Neelasandra and LR Nagar in east zone, one has been seen in Srinagar and Padmanabhanagar of south zone and one in Azad Nagar, west zone. Cholera has been unheard of for a few years, say doctors in private hospitals, which are also getting suspected cases.

However, the cases are not seen in clusters. "We have sent water samples to the Public Health Institute for testing. There is a possibility of sewage getting mixed with drinking water," said Dr. BK Vijendra, chief health officer, BBMP.

As per the Palike's records, cholera cases haven't been reported in Bengaluru since 2016, barring one in 2019. The public health wing of BBMP has started awareness programmes on drinking water safety in the affected areas.

Acute dehydration, diarrhoea, declining electrolyte level, and low sodium and potassium levels leading to low blood pressure are the tell-tale signs of cholera. There are 3 confirmatory tests for the infection: stool sample, stool culture and Polymerase Chain Reaction assay test.

At Manipal Hospitals, one of the suspected cholera patients has developed renal failure. "A total of 5 to 6 suspected cholera cases have come to light this week. The results are awaited. At a time when Covid-19 has emerged as a serious concern, diseases like cholera are also cropping up," said Dr. Anoop Amarnath, chief of clinical services, Manipal Hospitals.

A total of 5 patients at Fortis Hospital tested negative for cholera. They were suffering from acute gastroenteritis with severe dehydration and acute renal failure, said doctors.

Gastroenteritis (GE) cases have been reported at Epidemic Diseases hospital, Old Madras Road. The hospital saw 85 admissions due to GE in February [2020] and 85 cases have been recorded in March [2020] as of [Sat 9 Mar 2020]. "Most of them are from Whitefield, Old Airport Road, Koramangala and KR Puram," said Dr. Ansar Ahmed, medical superintendent of the hospital.

[3] Cholera - Somalia (Hiran region)

At least 7 deaths and over 700 cases have been reported in a cholera outbreak in Somalia, the United Nations said on Sunday [1 Mar 2020]. A total of 732 cases were recorded across the country between [23 Jan 2020 and 25 Feb 2020], according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA).

It said 7 deaths and 617 cases were reported in the central Hiran region and at least 115 cases were recorded in a week in the southeastern Banadir region, in which the capital Mogadishu is located.

"Three months after Deyr rains flooded parts of Somalia, acute water diarrhea (AWD)/cholera cases remain high ... This situation could worsen when April-June rains start," the UN agency said in a tweet.

It said women and children under the age of 5 were most vulnerable and they would need more help if AWD/cholera cases surge after the next rainfall season.

A doctor in Beledweyne, the capital of the hard-hit Hiran region, told Anadolu Agency that most victims in the latest outbreak were children, women and the elderly. "Children, pregnant women, and elderly people have been most affected. There are many in hospitals right now. We need the federal government, other states, and humanitarian agencies to send medical aid and doctors for our help," said Hussein Abdihakin Mohamed.

A total of 30 cholera deaths have been recorded in the Lubumbashi and Kafubu health areas since the beginning of 2020. According to provincial health minister Joseph Sambi Bulanda, the health areas of Kampemba and Kisanga (in Lubumbashi) are the most affected, with more than 200 cases recorded, including 12 deaths. Several health areas in the Kafubu health zone have also been shaken by the disease, with more than 106 cases including 18 deaths.

In addition, the Minister indicated that in Lubumbashi, the cholera treatment centre is set up at the Kenya Commune Reference General Hospital to receive patients free of charge.

Water chlorination is done by the NGO AIDES, a partner of the provincial ministry of health, which also carries out safe burials of victims. In addition, the awareness campaign continues to be done door-to-door to get people to observe hygiene measures to avoid this disease.

The provincial health minister believes that cholera is in the process of being controlled.

[As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
