Swimming pool operators and health officials in the Washington [D.C. area
were cited as emphasizing yesterday that they take strict precautions to
prevent contamination of pools, after public worries were aroused by an
unusual outbreak of a potentially lethal _E. coli_ bacterium at a suburban
Atlanta water park.
Five toddlers were hospitalized, with two in critical condition, after
developing the most serious form of _Escherichia coli_ infection in
Georgia. Eight others were sick as well, all after swimming in a pool in
which authorities believe an infected child defecated.
In response to a deluge of questions, in the region and across the country,
health authorities and pool managers stressed the rarity of the outbreak.
It is only the second time _E. coli_ has been transmitted in a chlorinated
swimming pool in the United States, they said. Generally, the bacterium
spreads through tainted, undercooked meat or unwashed fruits and vegetables.
They also said that water parks and other swimming pools follow rigorous
procedures, usually including hourly checks of chlorine levels in the
water, to keep pools safe. Pools evacuate swimmers immediately if chlorine
levels fall too far or the water is fouled.
The story goes on to say that chlorine is the principal guardian against
_E. coli_ and other bacteria in pools. State or county guidelines set
levels for chlorine in pools, with a typical minimum of 1.5 parts chlorine
per million parts of water. In Maryland, the guideline for kiddie pools is
stricter, at 3 parts chlorine per million parts water. That's also the
guideline for the District's 36 pools.

LABORATORY DATA LINK GEORGIA'S OUTBREAKS
Public health officials were cited as confirming Friday that a strain of
_E. coli_ that infected at least four children swimming at White Water park
has the same genetic fingerprint as bacteria found in hamburgers served
this spring in a Madison County elementary school.
All of the samples also were found to match _E. coli_ samples from two
Georgia sisters who did not visit White Water, but were confirmed to be
infected on June 2 and released Friday from Egleston Children's Hospital in
Atlanta.
Dr. Kathleen Toomey, director of the Division of Public Health, was cited
as saying that beyond a "laboratory match," there is no evidence linking
the burgers, the sisters and the water park, and that even if a connection
is discovered it isn't significant to the investigation because there is no
continuing risk from the beef, which was recalled in May after being sent
to Madison and three other Georgia county school districts. Toomey was
cited as saying the investigation is not focusing on a "Baby Zero"the first
child to contract _E. coli_ and spread it to others, but how the cluster at
White Water park happened.
Thirteen children are confirmed with _E. coli_ O157:H7 that was traced to
White Water park nine from Georgia and four from out-of-state. Stool
samples from four of those children were also subjected to a test called
"pulsed-field gel electrophoresis" (PFGE) that can distinguish among
subtypes of the O157 strain by reading its genetic pattern. All four, the
agency said, have identical genetic profiles.
That profile also matches PFGE tests done on samples from the sisters from
Hull, which is in Madison County, about 70 miles east of Atlanta. After
public health investigators interviewed the families, they found no link
between the sisters and the White Water cases.

Public health authorities were cited as confirming Monday that four more
confirmed cases were added to the E. coli O157:H7 tally from the White
Water Park in Atlanta: a 7-year-old from Bartow County who is not sick
enough to be hospitalized; one child in Illinois; and two children in
Alabama. A fifth child infected with E. coli and admitted Monday to
Egleston Children's Hospital has not been linked to the White Water cases.
In total, 17 children -- 10 in Georgia and seven from five other stateshave
been sickened by E. coli O157:H7 infection that is believed to have been
spread at White Water.
White Water managers acknowledged Monday that chlorine levels in one kiddie
pool had registered as low as one-quarter of the county's minimum standard
on June 11 and 12, the days that state officials say E. coli bacteria in
that pool infected several children.
Officials further said that four of the 17 cases, the two Alabama children,
a Georgia case discovered last week, and Matthew Addison, a 3-year-old in
critical condition with hemolytic uremic syndrome in Louisville, Ky.,
visited the water park not on June 11 or 12, when the other children were
presumably infected, but six days later, on June 17. The story adds that
five of the E. coli cases have been proved by genetic fingerprinting to
have been caused by one strain of bacteria, showing that they belong to the
same outbreak. Results of tests on the other 12, being performed by the
Public Health Division and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
are pending.
All four of the children added to the list Monday have been proven by
laboratory culture to have been infected with the life-threatening strain
of E. coli O157:H7. Their genetic fingerprinting will not be completed for
a week. All four of the new cases visited White Water.
