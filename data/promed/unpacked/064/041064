Milk from cattle with "mad cow disease" should not be used for human
consumption, though there is no evidence that it is infectious, the
European Union's (EU) top scientists said on Tuesday. The Scientific
Steering Committee (SCC), the EU's top advisory committee on health
matters, said there was no evidence that BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) could be passed on through drinking milk.
But it recommended that milk from BSE-infected animals should be destroyed
"as a precautionary measure" to prevent it entering the human and animal
food chain. [This statement indicates a step beyond a ban. It may be used
to feed the cow's own calf or for research, the committee said.
"We already have a recommendation in force which ensures that the consumer
would never get this milk," said European Commission spokesman Pietro
Petrucci. "This new data will be considered by the Commission and
amendments will be made to the rules if changes are needed," Petrucci added.
European beef consumption slumped in March, 1996, after the British
government announced a probable link between BSE and new variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (nvCJD), its human equivalent. Some 39 people
have died of nvCJD linked to eating beef from cattle infected with BSE.
The committee said calves from cows with BSE were 5 to 15 percent more
likely to catch the disease themselves, but this was probably not linked to
milk, but to other means of "vertical" transmission. Britain, which has had
most of the 175,000 recorded cases of BSE, already bans the sale of milk
from infected cows.
Separately, the committee also recommended a ban on using the remains of
animals which have died due to unidentified reasons for manufacturing
cosmetics and medicines. So-called "fallen animals" include everything from
pigs to cats. The committee said they should be "incinerated or burned
after rendering and not be recycled for any direct or indirect use," in
case they died of BSE or a similar disease.

Although there was no evidence that milk was a vector, this was one of the
very first regulatory measures introduced in the UK back in 1988, and
practised ever since. Astounding that the EU Scientific Steering Committee
[SSC has apparently just woken up to the idea. I have not seen the SSC
report alluded to, and this would not be the first time that journalists
have taken a paragraph out of context and put out a garbled version of what
is old news.
