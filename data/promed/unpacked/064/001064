Public health officials and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) are continuing to see an elevated number of hepatitis A cases in the state.

Since the beginning of the outbreak in August 2016, public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as potential sources of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

Michigan hepatitis A outbreak cases and deaths as of 2 May 2018:
Cases / Hospitalizations / Deaths
828 / 665 (80.3 percent) / 26 (3.1 percent)

[Cumulatively, 14.6 percent of total males are MSM (men who have sex with men); 3.0 percent of the total are healthcare workers, and 4.7 percent of the total are food handlers. More cases continue to occur, spreading north and west of the main southeastern Michigan focus of the outbreak. The total of cases continues to increase, although at a lower rate, and in numbers and fatalities has altogether surpassed the numbers of the now essentially ended southern California outbreak.

Since [1 Jan 2017], Utah public health has identified 230 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection; many among persons who are homeless and/or using illicit drugs. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to a national outbreak of hepatitis A involving cases in California and Arizona. Hospitalization rates of less than 40 percent have been described in previous hepatitis A outbreaks; however, other jurisdictions associated with this outbreak are reporting case hospitalization rates approaching 70 percent. The high rate of hospitalization may be a result of cases having underlying illnesses (such as alcoholism), or a higher rate of hepatitis comorbidities (such as hepatitis B or C). In response to the outbreak, public health officials have been working to identify cases and contacts, provide education, and ensure opportunities for vaccination of close contacts to cases and vulnerable populations.

Hepatitis A is usually spread through having oral contact with items contaminated with hepatitis A, for example, through ingesting food or drinks contaminated by infected feces. Some people do not develop symptoms, even if infected. If symptoms occur, they usually appear anywhere from 2-6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days, and may include jaundice (the yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea. Hepatitis A vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection.

Since 1 Aug 2017, the Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPH) has identified 448 confirmed cases of acute hepatitis A, a liver disease caused by hepatitis A virus. An increase in cases since 1 Aug 2017, primarily among the homeless and drug users, prompted declaration of a statewide outbreak in November 2017. Viral sequencing has linked several outbreak-associated cases in Kentucky with outbreaks in California and Utah.

KDPH is working closely with the CDC and local health departments to provide guidance and education to health professionals and at-risk populations. Treatment for acute hepatitis A generally involves supportive care, with specific complications treated as appropriate. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Counts as of 28 Apr 2018
- Total outbreak: 448
- Hospitalizations: 315
