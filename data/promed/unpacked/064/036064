DNA testing points to elk as likely source of brucellosis
---------------------------------------------------------
Fingerprinting tests, or genotyping, from the brucellosis-infected
cow found in Paradise Valley earlier this year (2008) have identified
elk as the most likely source of the disease.

According to the report issued by the National Veterinary Services
Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa, "Genotyping results ... indicate
that the _Brucella abortus_ strain recovered from the adult cow in
Montana appears to be similar to strains recovered from bison and elk
in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA)."

"The genetic analysis is consistent with other epidemiological
information that suggests the transmission of brucellosis from elk to
cattle," said Dr. Martin Zaluski, state veterinarian. "We've now had
2 cases of the disease in 2 years, and no contact with bison in
either case. It supports our conclusion that elk were the source in
both cases."

Zaluski said the information is a "crucial" piece of evidence that
should pave the way for future efforts to manage the risk of
brucellosis transmission from wildlife to cattle.

"The evidence supports the concept of interspecies transmission and
shows that brucellosis must be a consideration in elk management in
the Greater Yellowstone area," Zaluski said.

The Montana Board of Livestock (BOL) at its 22 Jul 2008 meeting
passed a motion directing Zaluski and the Department of Livestock
(DOL) to establish a task force that can evaluate the problem and
develop potential solutions.

The motion reads, "Since there is compelling evidence that
brucellosis can be transmitted to cattle from wildlife, the BOL
directs the DOL to work with Fish, Wildlife and Parks to jointly set
up a task force that includes both livestock producers and sportsmen
to help design both short- and long-term wildlife disease management
policies."

"A task force with a strong mission statement to keep it focused will
be an immensely valuable tool," Zaluski said.

Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that causes pregnant cows to
abort, and also causes decreased milk production, weight loss,
infertility and lameness. A zoonotic disease, it can be passed to
humans through unpasteurized dairy products and contact with birthing
fluids from an infected animal.

Montana had been brucellosis-free since 1985, but the disease was
discovered in a Bridger cattle herd in May of 2007. That outbreak was
traced to a herd in Emigrant, located just north of Yellowstone
National Park. This year's case, which was identified in late May
2008 and confirmed on 9 Jun 2008 was the 2nd found in Montana within
the last 12 months; as such, it is expected that USDA will revoke
Montana's Brucellosis Class Free status. Brucellosis was also found
this summer in Wyoming. [See comment below].

Fingerprinting, or genotyping, is a way to determine the genetic
makeup of an organism or a group of organisms. The process used in
Montana's brucellosis investigation is called variable number tandem
repeat (VNTR), which is especially useful in genetic and biological
research, forensic crime investigations, paternity suits, and to
study genetic diversity and breeding patterns of wild or domestic animals.

[Genotyping has been proving useful with TB in Michigan, so it is
only natural that the same technology should be helpful in the
brucellosis cases in those areas affected by the disease in the
Greater Yellowstone Area. - Mod.TG

This report is a big disappointment, since on 1 Feb 2008 the US
Department of Agriculture announced that for the first time in the
74-year history of the brucellosis program, all 50 states, Puerto
Rico, and the Virgin Islands have simultaneously achieved class-free
status in cattle <http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/mar08/080315f.asp>
