A contingency plan for hepatitis A prevention and control has just been launched in Mahates Municipality, Bolivar Department, Colombia. The area was declared by the Departmental Health Secretary as being "at risk for contamination." This information was released by Ms. Ethel Hadechine, the healthcare official in charge, who reported that there are 15 affected individuals in Mahates, according to the Epidemiological Surveillance System (SIVIGILA, Spanish initials).

13 of them were detected in the Camilo Torres school, Nuestra Senora del Carmen site, located in Vera community. Five of the cases were confirmed as a result of laboratory tests, and 7 were considered to have epidemiological links. The remaining 2 cases occurred in the Lazaro Martinez-Olier school, located in Santander community, where samples were taken from patients and were found to yield positive results.

The cause of this situation is revealed by the results of sampling from a pool at a school located in Mahates Municipality, which was reported as positive for hepatitis A virus and rotavirus. Since last Mon 3 Dec 2012, a contingency plan has been initiated whereby a multidisciplinary team from the Health Secretariat has sampled water from the municipal network, and a group of food specialists has started instructing the community in the proper procedures for water disinfection, fruit cleansing, etc. Ms. Hadechine announced that protocols and guidelines for dealing with hepatitis A virus infection will be circulated, and fecal samples will be collected in order to perform surveillance for rotavirus infections in 5- and 6-year-old children.

"On 13 and 14 Dec 2012, surveillance, laboratory analysis, and environmental risk assessments were performed in order to strengthen local capabilities," declared Ms. Hadechine. "Our conclusions aim to improve health conditions; therefore, an improvement plan was elaborated and accepted at Departmental and Municipal levels. Deadlines have been established, and an improvement plan for the local municipality was submitted on 12 Dec 2012," according to Ms. Hadechine.

[Hepatitis A virus infection, and now infection by some serotypes of rotavirus, are vaccine-preventable diseases. However, in most situations, the transmission of these viruses can be prevented effectively by provision of clean drinking water and efficient arrangements for disposal of sewage. In Mahates, it is likely that the later procedure will be the most cost-effective.
