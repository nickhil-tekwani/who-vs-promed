Seven Eastern Cape people have now contracted Rift Valley fever
(RVF), which has already claimed the lives of 9 people in the country
and infected 111 others. The 7 in the province include farmers, a
veterinarian and his assistant, and farm workers from Hofmeyer and
Middleburg. "There has been an inter-governmental approach adopted
and an outbreak response team activated," provincial Department of
Health spokesperson Siyanda Manana said yesterday [Tue 13 Apr 2010].

The 7 are among 111 people confirmed to have been infected
countrywide since the disease broke out in February 2010. Those
confirmed to have died from the fever include 5 from the Free State
and 4 from the Northern Cape," National Health spokesperson Charity
Bengu said.

She said that 81 people from the Free Sate had been infected, 7 from
the Eastern Cape, 22 cases from the Northern Cape and one from the
North West. Bengu said that direct contact with RVF-infected
livestock and/or links to farms with confirmed animal cases remained
the main risk factor for infection.

The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and occurs throughout Africa
and Madagascar when exceptionally heavy rain favours the breeding of
the mosquitoes.

Meanwhile, the test results for a patient who died at East London's
St Dominic's Hospital last week have come back negative for a
suspected viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF). VHF is not related to Rift
Valley Fever. The patient, whose details have not been released,
arrived at the hospital on Thursday [8 Apr 2010] evening exhibiting
signs of a VHF. The hospital immediately isolated him as a
precautionary measure.

[Since the previous report from South Africa, dated 9 Apr 2010, the
number of confirmed human cases has increased from 100 to 120 and the
number of deaths from 7 to 9. The disease (in humans) remains
confined to the Free Sate, Eastern Cape, Northern Cape and North West
provinces. Those infected have been people working with livestock,
suggesting that mosquito-borne transmission is not a major factor in
transmission of infection in this outbreak. For detailed information
on Rift Valley fever in South Africa, go to the South African
National Institute for Communicable Diseases website at:

This report indicates further that the case of suspected viral
haemorrhagic fever described in ProMED-mail post: "Viral hemorrhagic
fever - South Africa: (Eastern Cape) RFI 20100414.1204" is no longer
considered to be suffering from a viral haemorrhagic fever.
