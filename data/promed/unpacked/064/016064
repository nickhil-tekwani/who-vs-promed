To get to Obalende, Ikoyi from the airport, you have to pass through Ikeja, Yaba, Lagos, see http://mapq.st/1nrFW6L, and now it is essential that tracing all who had contact with the case is rapidly and efficiently done.

We are not out of the woods yet, until we cross the time covering exposure/contact and incubation period of the disease.

One aspect we miss out ...did the flight come direct from Liberia or were there stops on the way say Lome, etc.? And who had contact with [the Liberian]? We need to contact other countries where ASKY [Airlines] might have landed and is still landing. I hear also about other airlines -- Arik does direct Abuja-Monrovia-Freetown flights. So we must also mount our surveillance not only in Lagos, but also in Abuja, not forgetting the Idi-Iroko Seme border.

Another point which made me proud of this issue was the laboratory support within the country. The lab in LUTH [Lagos University Teaching Hospital] under Prof Omilabu received samples on 22 Jul 2014 and the next day provided results of a pan-filovirus-family diagnosis. Samples were also sent to Prof Happi's lab at the Redeemer's University late on 23 Jul 2014. The Happi team worked and tested for both pan-filovirus and specific Ebola-Zaire and Ebola-Sudan viruses, and early on 25 Jul 2014 confirmed the isolate as a strain of Ebola-Zaire. Later WHO sent samples to Dakar [Senegal, Institut Pasteur] and it was again confirmed as an Ebola-Zaire isolate. I hear the RUN lab will commence sequencing studies pretty soon. My congratulations to our colleagues in LUTH and RUN for a great job.

[Nigerian health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu was reported as saying "We have already got in touch with all the passengers." See ProMED-mail archive 20140726.2636095.

With regard to this imported case in Lagos, Nigeria, "'The Liberian' was quarantined on arrival and had not entered the city, a Nigerian official told Reuters." (http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/25/us-heath-ebola-nigeria-idUSKBN0FU1LE20140725. I misconstrued that statement in my comment on ProMED-mail post (101) archive no 20140726.2636095, to mean he never left the airport. However, he was quarantined at a hospital in Ikoyi and never "entered the city". Nevertheless, people who touched him at the airport and on the way to the hospital will have entered the city to go home.

Congratulations to Nigerian labs on their expertise! - Mod.JW

Ebola [virus disease] outbreak update
-------------------------------------
As of today, 25 Jul 2014, we have a cumulative total of 116 survivors, 450 confirmed Ebola virus disease [EVD] cases and 152 Ebola confirmed deaths; 73 patients are currently admitted at the EVD treatment centers in Kenema and Kailahun.

His excellency the president of the republic of Sierra Leone, Dr Ernest Bai Koroma, today [25 Jul 2014] called an emergency DEPAC [emergency presidential development partnership committee] meeting of all development partners to discuss the current EVD outbreak in the country and to present them his government's new strategy to end the disease within the next 60 to 90 days. In that meeting, the president informed the partners of his government's decision to intensify activities and interventions in containing the disease and stopping its spread. The president further informed partners that he has established a presidential taskforce to serve as an oversight for all EVD implemented activities. The taskforce, which will be chaired by him, will comprise all cabinet ministers and key stakeholders directly dealing with activities geared towards stopping the spread of the disease in the country.

The EOC [Emergency Operations Center ] wishes the general public and all partners working in the healthcare sector to know that Dr Sheikh Umar Khan is still stable and responding well to treatment.

I'm afraid the government of Sierra Leone is over-optimistic that it will be able to end the EVD epidemic in the next 2-3 months. Getting community cooperation is very difficult. Years ago, when I was in CDC, I tried to get the government of Puerto Rico to eliminate dengue from Puerto Rico by mobilizing the public to get rid of mosquito breeding on their properties, but was told by householders, "You gringos think we are stupid! Those worms wriggling in the rain barrel won't turn into mosquitoes!" They have had annual epidemics of dengue there every year since. - Mod.JW]

[3] Experimental drugs, vaccines

Ebola virus disease [EVD] outbreak not right for testing experimental vaccines, drugs: experts
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The largest Ebola outbreak in history is defying the containment efforts of affected countries and international response teams, leading to calls from some quarters to use experimental drugs or vaccines to try to stop the deadly virus. But a number of experts -- including the scientist who led the work on a Canadian-made Ebola vaccine -- say deploying untested tools in the current West African outbreak could be disastrous.

They say taking such a risky gamble could further erode local trust in the response teams, undermine their efforts, and even endanger them. And if anyone were to have a bad reaction to one of the experimental therapies, it could jeopardize years of expensive and painstaking work spent developing tools with which to fight Ebola and its cousin, the Marburgvirus. "I get emails basically every 2nd day from someone asking either 'Is there something that you're planning?' or 'Shouldn't you?' And I know I'm not the only one getting those emails," says Dr Heinz Feldmann, an ebolavirus expert who heads the laboratory of virology at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, Montana.

While most of these discussions are happening within scientific circles, the director of Britain's Wellcome Trust recently aired the issue publicly. Dr Jeremy Farrar, an infectious diseases expert, has questioned why the therapies that are furthest along in the developmental pipeline aren't being used. He suggests if this outbreak were occurring in the developed world, there would be no debate. "Imagine if you take a region of Canada, America, Europe, and you had 450 people dying of a viral hemorrhagic fever. It would just be unacceptable -- and it's unacceptable in West Africa," Farrar says.

He notes the Canadian-made Ebola vaccine -- a project Feldmann led a decade ago when he worked at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg -- was released under emergency use provisions in 2009 when a German researcher pricked herself with a needle containing ebolavirus. She survived, but it was never clear if it was because of the vaccine or because she was not infected. "We moved heaven and earth to help a German lab technician. Why is it different because this is West Africa?" Farrar asks.

A small community of researchers, mostly based in Canada and the USA, has been working for years on vaccines and drugs to protect against or treat these viruses, which are among the deadliest known to humankind. The viruses are transmitted through contact with bodily fluids. People caring for the dying -- or preparing their bodies for burial -- are often infected. With little to offer medically, the main job of response teams is to break the chains of transmission by figuring out who is infected and isolating them. But these efforts are often met with distrust. Rumours emerge that the Western doctors are harvesting organs; people hide cases or flee -- extending the range of the epidemic.

A number of vaccines are in various stages of development. Studies done in non-human primates suggest they could both prevent illness and improve survival chances [even] if given after infection. There are also a number of therapies in the works, including antibody combinations that look promising in animal testing. But the researchers have always been stymied by the challenges of getting regulatory approval for these interventions, which cannot follow the traditional pathways to licensure. Most drugs or vaccines can only make it to market once large scale studies show they are both safe and effective. But the only way the world will learn if ebolavirus and Marburgvirus vaccines and drugs work is by using them in an outbreak -- a reality rife with ethical concerns and logistical problems.

In the current context, with response teams struggling to gain the co-operation of fearful locals, word that experimental treatments were to be used could further exacerbate an already taxing situation, says Dr Armand Sprecher, of Medecins Sans Frontiers (Doctors Without Borders). The organization warned recently that the outbreak was out of control and said it [MSF] was stretched to its limits. "I would hate to cause more problems than we solve in the short run," Sprecher says. "Right now people are at their wits end just to deliver the care that we're able to provide."

Dr David Heymann, a professor of infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says after this outbreak is contained, the WHO, ebolavirus researchers, the countries they work in, and the countries which are prone to these epidemics need to sit down and plan how they will deploy and test these therapies the next time. They need to have the study protocols ready to be signed. "It would be unethical to roll it out now, in my opinion," says Heymann, a former assistant director general at the WHO and a member of the team that responded to the 1st Ebola virus disease outbreak in 1976. Feldmann agrees with Heymann's idea. Over the years he has been frustrated by the inability to get these needed tools approved. But he says he has been persuaded by friends working on the current response that using untested and unlicenced medical interventions now would be a mistake.

One was blunt about how badly awry such an effort could go. "He said 'Anything injectable would be a disaster.' He thinks the rumour that we're just spreading the disease is going to be out there before we even start," Feldmann says. "I think as bad as it sounds -- and I really don't feel good about saying this -- I have the feeling they have to find a way to end this one without (experimental) therapy."
