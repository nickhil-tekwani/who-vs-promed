The moderator's comment about the use of antibiotics as a treatment
for botulism in waterfowl is on target. Generally, in the field of
wildlife rehabilitation botulism is treated with supportive care and
regular gavage of lactated Ringer's solution or a similar saline
product. Antibiotics may be indicated if secondary infection is found
in the animal, but usually is not the 1st treatment choice. Flushing
the toxin from the animal with gavage can be successful if paralysis
has not progressed to an advanced stage.
