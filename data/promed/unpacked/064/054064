After admitting that the Maranhao [state] capital [Sao Luis] is undergoing an outbreak of virus disease for at least 2 weeks, the Municipal Secretary of Health, Helena Dualibe, stated that medical attention in the health posts and hospitals in the capital has been strengthened. "We have increased the number of teams on night shifts so that the population will effectively be better attended," said the Secretary.

Since the beginning of the rainy season, the Maranhao capital has been accompanied by a significant increase in the number of people infected by viruses, which have left public hospitals and health posts in Sao Luis crowded. Those seeking medical attention have had to have much patience.

Medical attention in Socorrinho, a neighborhood in Sao Francisco, for example, increased from 150 to 300 patients per day in recent weeks. According to the Municipal Secretariat of Health, 90 per cent of those receiving attention are people with some sort of virus infection.

The physician Julia Bacelar explained that during this [rainy] season, the number of cases of virus infections increase due to the change in climate. She stated that dengue fever cases increase as well, which can be confused with [other] virus diseases.

[The official position in relation to the outbreak of "virus disease" is worrisome.

There is no information about time/dates-people-places that would permit identification of possible etiologies. Also, there is an absence of more specific information, in terms of the dengue epidemic season, against the risk (or impending risk) of spread of chikungunya from the areas in the country (or from outside it) where transmission is already a reality, or against risk of the spread of measles from the state of Ceara, with ever-present respiratory viruses, [or] noroviruses. Until there is a proven (or otherwise disclosed) etiology, as they say, "it could be anything."

Lets continue to watch this situation. - Mod.RNA [in Portuguese, trans. Mod.TY]

Mod.RNA's comments are spot on. No evidence is presented to substantiate that the outbreak is, in fact, due to infection by one or more viruses. Nor is there adequate epidemiological information provided that could be helpful in establishing a list of potential etiological agents. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving additional clinical information currently available from health posts and center, and new information, especially laboratory results, as it becomes available.

An undiagnosed outbreak of a presumed virus disease was reported before, in Para state in 2003. The definitive diagnosis was never reported subsequently. One hopes that there will be adequate follow up in this Sao Luis outbreak to establish a diagnosis and a more complete picture of what is occurring there.
