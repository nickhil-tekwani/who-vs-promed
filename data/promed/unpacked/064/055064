Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal are in the grip of a rabies outbreak, with
40 fatalities reported since last year [2006.]
Dr Jaco Folmer, medical director of SAA-Netcare Travel Clinics, said
rabies is endemic to South Africa, with the majority of cases in
these 2 provinces. He said until 1961 there was no rabies found in
KwaZulu-Natal.
Folmer said 31 cases of rabies were reported last year [2006], of
which 21 were from the Limpopo province, and all were fatal. This
year [2007], however, there [have been] 9 deaths, including one case
from Zambia.
Folmer added, "Usually, KwaZulu-Natal has by far the most reported
and confirmed cases. Since 1986 there have been between 6 and 32
cases per year in this province."
Rabies is transmitted by infected animals, and in South Africa the
main hosts are dogs, yellow mongooses, black-backed jackals, and
bat-eared foxes.
Folmer said, "Though not curable, rabies is 100 percent preventable.
Vaccines are available to prevent this deadly disease."

[There have been human rabies cases in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa,
before (see below). It would be interesting to know if the source of
all of these exposures were dogs or wild mammals. Presumably this
outbreak is due to classic street rabies.
However, the rabies-related Mokola virus, which can cause rabies-like
disease also, has been isolated from cats and house shrews (_Suncus
murinus_) in South Africa, although Mokola virus seems much less
likely to be the virus responsible for this outbreak.
