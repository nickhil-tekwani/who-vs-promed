The Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health is today [27 Jan 2015] investigating a case of legionnaires' disease (LD) affecting a man aged 44 [years].

The patient, with good past health, has presented with fever, cough, and shortness of breath since [20 Jan 2015] and consulted a private doctor on [23 Jan 2015]. He attended the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital (PYNEH) yesterday [26 Jan 2015] and was admitted on the same day for further management. The clinical diagnosis was pneumonia and he has been in stable condition all along.

His urine sample tested positive for _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen upon testing by PYNEH.

Initial enquiries by the CHP revealed that the patient had travelled to Dongguan on his own from [14 to 16 Jan 2015]. His home contacts have remained asymptomatic so far. Investigations are proceeding.

This is the 6th LD case reported to the CHP this year [2015]. In 2014 and 2013, 41 and 28 cases were recorded, respectively.

[For discussions of legionnaires' disease, see my comments in prior ProMED-mail posts listed in the see also's below.

The 6th case of legionnaires' disease in Hong Kong this year (2015) is said to have travelled to the nearby city of Dongguan on 14 to 16 Jan 2015, and first developed symptoms on 20 Jan 2015, 4-6 days later. Legionnaires' disease has an incubation period of 2 to 14 days after exposure (http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/clinicians.html), which implies that he could have been exposed to a source of _Legionella_ in Dongguan.

However, we don't know if this 6th case is an isolated case or part of an outbreak from a common source. The news report does not say if there are any cases of legionnaires' disease in Dongguan or if there are epidemiological links between the 6 cases of legionnaires' disease that have occurred so far this year in Hong Kong or the 41 cases occurring in Hong Kong last year (2014), which is almost 1.5 times higher than the number of cases (28) that occurred in Hong Kong in 2013.

Genotyping of isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, genotyping is often difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because the diagnosis is frequently made only on the basis of urinary _Legionella pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing (as occurred in the 6th Hong Kong case described in the news report above) or serology rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

Dongguan, with a population of 8.29 million in 2012, is an industrial city in Guangdong province, China, immediately east of the Pearl River, south of the provincial capital of Guangzhou, and north of the city of Shenzhen. Hong Kong is immediately south of Shenzhen (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongguan). A map of this region can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dongguan,+Guangdong,+China. - Mod.ML
