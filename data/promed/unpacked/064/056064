Re: Transmission of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus
---------------------------------------------------------
The moderator's comments (Crimean-Congo HF - Afghanistan, Pakistan (02), 10
Oct 2001) seem to suggest that Crimean-Congo-hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is
spread only by ticks. CCHF is also spread from person to person and
nosocomial outbreaks have been reported (Am J Trop Med Hyg 29:941-7, 1980).

[It was not my intention to imply that Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever
(CCHF) virus is spread only by ticks. I was concerned to emphasize the
taxonomic and epidemiologic differences between CCHF virus and Ebola virus.
CCHF is a zoonotic disease, although clinical disease is confined to humans.
The virus is maintained by a cycle involving transovarial and transstadial
transmission in _Hyalomma_ spp. and related ticks. Larval and nymphal ticks
become infected when feeding on small mammals and ground-dwelling birds,
and adult ticks when feeding on wild and domestic ruminants. The clinical
features of CCHF have been described well in the early Russian literature,
and nosocomial outbreaks have been common among hospitalized patients,
particularly those undergoing surgery. Nosocomial outbreaks have been
recorded in the former Soviet Union, the former Yugoslavia, the Middle
East, and South Africa. These typically involve a patient with hemorrhage
requiring surgical intervention, followed by subsequent spread of infection
to medical personnel and family members.
In Asia cases of CCHF usually occur singly among shepherds, farmers, and
others in tick-infested rural areas. Sometimes small clusters of CCHF occur
among those involved in the slaughter of infected animals. The disease
pattern is quite different from that associated with Ebola virus. Ebola
virus should not be considered as a cause of hemorrhagic fever in Asia
without sufficient reason. - Mod.CP
