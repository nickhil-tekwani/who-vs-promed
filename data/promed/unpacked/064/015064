Autochthonous case of dengue in France
--------------------------------------

Summary
-------
In October 2013, autochthonous dengue fever was diagnosed in a laboratory technician in Bouches-du-Rhone [Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur department], southern France, a department colonised by _Aedes albopictus_ since 2010. After ruling out occupational contamination, we identified the likely chain of local vector-borne transmission from which the autochthonous case arose. Though limited, this 2nd occurrence of autochthonous dengue transmission in France highlights that efforts should be continued to rapidly detect dengue virus introduction and prevent its further dissemination in France.

Introduction
------------
In October 2013, the French National Reference Laboratory for arboviruses (NRL) -- hosted at the Institut de Recherche Biomedicale des Armees [Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute], Marseille -- reported an autochthonous case of dengue fever to the Regional Health Authority of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur. The case lived in the department of Bouches-du-Rhone, France. The national and regional health authorities initiated a multidisciplinary investigation to determine the source of infection of the case and the extent of possible dissemination of dengue virus (DENV).

Background
----------
The continuous spread of _Aedes (Stegomyia) albopictus (Skuse)_, an invasive mosquito species is well-known vector of chikungunya virus and DENV . Public health concern has been heightened since limited foci of local transmission of DENV were reported in September 2010 in Nice, southern France, and Croatia and more recently in 2012 in Madeira, Portugal (where the vector was _Ae. aegypti_).

_Ae. albopictus_ was introduced in southern France in 2004, near the Italian border. Since then, it has continuously spread eastwards and northwards and has to date colonised 17 departments (administrative districts) including Bouches-du-Rhone since 2009. Prevention of the introduction of DENV and chikungunya virus in the departments where _Ae. albopictus_ is established falls under a national preparedness and response plan created in 2006. Implemented each year during the vector activity period, from 1 May-30 Nov, the plan is based on enhanced surveillance aiming at the early detection of imported dengue and chikungunya cases.

Discussion
----------
This 2nd report of autochthonous dengue in mainland France follows a cluster of 2 locally acquired cases in Alpes-Maritimes [Provence-Alpes-CÃ´te d'Azur region] in 2010. Because our patient was a laboratory technician who daily collected blood specimens, we not only explored vector-borne local transmission of DENV but also thoroughly investigated potential occupational transmission. The latter hypothesis appears unlikely since, unlike the situation for other occupational dengue cases, our investigation pinpointed neither a viraemic or infected patient sampled nor any accidental exposure to blood at the laboratory during the likely exposure period of the case.

Conclusion
----------
Although limited, this autochthonous transmission of DENV in southern France is a clear reminder that local transmission can be triggered in Europe by the introduction of the virus in areas colonised by _Ae. albopictus_, as it occurred already in 2010 in Nice. The French preparedness and response plan, in operation since 2006, proved pivotal to detect and control this threat.

Reducing the risk of local DENV dissemination to zero appears an elusive goal in the context of the continuous spread of _Ae albopictus_. Coordinated enhanced surveillance and response are therefore the backbone of the prevention of the occurrence of autochthonous cases and the containment of possible outbreaks. Such a plan requires, however, multidisciplinary expertise and resources and should be adapted wisely and regularly to ensure its sustainability and efficiency. In addition, innovative vector control methods and further elucidation of the dynamics of DENV transmission in non-endemic areas are needed to keep Europe safe from dengue.
