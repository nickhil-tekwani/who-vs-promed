Mystery Disease Hits Cattle in Pakistan
----------------------------------------
ISLAMABAD: A mysterious disease is causing the death of cattle heads worth
millions of rupees in and around Okara of Pakistan's Punjab province.
Breeders have started to transport their cattle out of the city and its
immediate environments. The disease is killing cattle within a week of the
appearance of symptoms, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported on Fri 17
May.
Local vets are treating the infected animals in a hit and trial manner,
with no positive results. Symptoms of this deadly disease include constant
watering of eyes, drastic drop in food and water intake, and a sense of
choking observed in the affected cattle.
The disease is spreading fast. Those who cannot transport their animals
away have demanded the livestock department authorities to provide
life-saving vaccine for their cattle and save them from tremendous
financial loss.

[The clinical and epidemiological data in this news item, including
(estimated) number of cases and mortalities, are unsatisfactory; even the
infectivity of the reported condition is not certain. However, the absence
of diarrhea and lameness might allude the possible exclusion of rinderpest
and FMD. Colleagues in Punjab are invited to send more detailed clinical
observations. - Mod. AS].
