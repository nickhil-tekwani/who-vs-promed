A new study into the health and social consequences of the 2001
foot-and-mouth crisis in Cumbria, (United Kingdom) reveals that the
county's farmers remain bitter and afraid. Researchers from Lancaster
University analysed the observations of a panel of 54 people closely
involved in the crisis to assess the impact of the epidemic. Panel
members ranged from farmers and slaughtermen to community nurses,
vets, and businessmen and -women.
What researchers found was a picture of isolated and embattled
communities in which some people took to drink and antidepressants in
order to cope. Community nurse Teresa Taylor described how routine
visits to residents often became counselling sessions lasting hours.
Some patients were isolated from their families, unable to sleep, and
turning to drink, she said.
Other panel members spoke of "bitterness, frustration, mistrust, and
anxiety" during and after the epidemic and of feeling let down by the
government's response. This feeling was exacerbated by government
"spin" which denied the reality of Cumbria's nightmare and left
people feeling betrayed.
Dr Peter Tiplady, retired director of public health at North Cumbria
Health Authority, said that the study showed that the F&M crisis had
"a definite effect on human health." Figures emerging from separate
research showed an increased mortality rate in Cumbria around Easter
2001 -- the peak of the outbreak, he revealed.
The Lancaster University report is due to be completed in April 2004,
when it will be sent to the Department of the Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs. Copies will also be sent to the Department of Health,
the Department of Trade and Industry and the Environment Agency

[In a separate report, many of the contractors in the southwest of
the UK who helped with the clean-up are still waiting to be paid by
the UK Government, according to the Forum of Private Business (FPB).
The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
admitted recently that GBP 50 million owed to those who helped during
the crisis is still outstanding. Yet, many in the sector feel that
the real figure may be twice the official estimate. This can only add
to the problems voiced by the Lancaster University focus group quoted
above.
Foot and Mouth crisis still lingers on in the South West UK
