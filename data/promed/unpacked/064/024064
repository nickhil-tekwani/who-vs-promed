West Nile Virus: Neurological Symptoms Alert
--------------------------------------------
Vision loss, muscle tremors, and numbness may be symptoms of West
Nile virus infection, according to researchers who are warning
doctors and patients to be on the lookout as warmer weather and the
mosquito season approach. The neurological symptoms seem to mimic
those of such ailments as strokes, Parkinson's disease, and
poliomyelitis.

"It can look like another disease, but if it's summer months, they
need to think about West Nile virus infection," said Dr. Nidhi
Watson, a neurologist at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center.
Watson and doctors from 2 other Chicago-area hospitals reached that
conclusion after pooling information on 28 patients seen from August
through October last year [2002]. More than half had unusual
neurological symptoms. The 28 contributed to Illinois' nation-leading
West Nile fever toll last year: 884 reported human cases and 62
deaths. Nationwide, there were 4161 cases and 277 deaths as the virus
spread toward the West Coast. The doctors have prepared a report on
the 28 cases for presentation on Mon 31 Mar 2003 at the American
Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in Honolulu.

A high occurrence of neurological symptoms was found in West Nile
fever patients hospitalized in Louisiana last summer. The federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working to get the word
out to doctors to be alert for those signs, said Dr. Jim Sejvar, a
CDC neuroepidemiologist.

Most people bitten by an infected mosquito don't become ill. About 20
percent will develop West Nile fever, which includes mild symptoms
such as headache, swollen lymph nodes, and a rash. The CDC estimates
that less than 1 percent will develop a more severe illness
characterized by encephalitis or meningitis, both neurological
ailments. Encephalitis may involve headaches and confusion.
Meningitis may also include severe headache, but also stiff neck,
vomiting, and sensitivity to light.

The Illinois researchers found that neurological problems other than
encephalitis and meningitis may also occur. Of the 28 Illinois
patients, 15 (54 percent) had symptoms such as vision loss, tremors
similar to those seen in Parkinson's patients, muscle weakness, or
numbness. While 9 of the 15 were diagnosed with meningitis or
encephalitis, 6 never developed those ailments, said co-author Dr.
Sidney Houff, Neurology Chairman at Loyola University Medical Center.

Most patients had milder symptoms including fever about a week or so
before neurological symptoms developed, but it was the more severe
symptoms that prompted them to seek help. Houff said the study
suggests such symptoms occur in a large number of patients, though
the true incidence requires more research. Older people and those
with weakened conditions are thought to be most susceptible to ill
effects from the virus, and the 28 Chicago-area patients were age 58
on average. Some had underlying ailments that may have made them more
vulnerable to West Nile virus infection, Watson said.
