I agree with comments by CHC re: Philippine mosquito control. As a
Filipino, I know how it is here - so far I have not seen any indication
that the government health agency has coherent programs attendant to dengue
as a public health concern. I wonder what 19,000 cases mean to this agency
-- and 1998 isn't over yet.
I came across the dengue literature while I was a Fellow in the United
States. Using Pinheiro and Corber's (1997, also Halstead 1992) data on
government case reports to the WHO, Philippine cases are up by more than
68% for 1992-96 (32,344 cases) or over thrice that combined for the periods
1982-86 (5,373) and 1986-90 (4,674). The 1998 figure (19,000) is over half
the total cases reported for the 5-year period, 1992-96. Something must be
done here.
The archipelagic nature of the Philippines is probably a blessing. Were
this country a solid land mass like Thailand or Vietnam, cases could pile
even higher and deeper. This shouldn't be an excuse though.
