Anthrax kills cattle in northeastern Montana
-------------------------------------------
A total of 8 cows in Sheridan County died from anthrax last week
[20-24 Aug 2007], and state livestock officials say they won't be
surprised if more cases are reported this year. Montana Department of
Livestock spokeswoman Lisa Schmidt says the dead cows were part of a
single herd on a ranch near Raymond, which is between Plentywood and
the Canadian border.
Schmidt says the infected cattle were buried 10 feet underground in
an effort to keep the disease from spreading further. She says the
latest cases were confirmed Friday [24 Aug 2007]. Livestock officials
say once an outbreak starts, other cases in the area are possible.
Dr. Jeanne Rankin is Montana's acting state veterinarian. She says
livestock owners should contact their veterinarians immediately if
their livestock are lost in sudden, unexplained deaths.

Anthrax claims 8 cows in Montana's Sheridan County
---------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory results confirmed anthrax as the cause of death of 8 cows
last week in a single herd near Raymond, MT, according to the Montana
Department of Livestock. Local and state animal health officials have
visited the location and have taken appropriate measures to prevent
further spread of the disease. Field investigations indicate this was
a naturally occurring case of anthrax and has been limited to one
ranch. Neighboring ranches have been notified.
The last reported case of naturally occurring anthrax in livestock in
Montana was reported in 2005 in Roosevelt County, and before that, 2
unrelated cases in 1999, one occurring in Yellowstone County and
another outbreak later that year in McCone County.
Acting state veterinarian Dr. Jeanne Rankin said anthrax spores are
known to exist in soils in certain regions of Montana, and that
isolated cases of anthrax can be expected to occasionally occur in
the state. Outbreaks have occurred in both North Dakota and South
Dakota this season, indicating climatic conditions are favorable for
such a naturally occurring outbreak. Rankin urges livestock owners to
contact their herd veterinarian immediately to investigate incidents
of sudden, unexplained deaths in their herd.

I contacted Jeanne Rankin, MT Assistant State Veterinarian, who
kindly filled in some of the blanks. Apparently Sheridan country had
not knowingly had any cases of anthrax since 1934. In early July
2007, there was monsoon-like rain and hail, with devasting effect on
crops. It is now hot and dry. The owner, who is trying to harvest his
damaged crops and thus distracted, had noticed one cow dead. A
neighbour flying over the ranch noticed 2 others down and informed
the owner. The cows had access to good grass, though now it is short,
and adequate water. The carcasses were found on the hillsides, not in
any alkali drainages as in Roosevelt County in 2005. Heavy rains have
long been associated with anthrax outbreaks. One can only speculate
as to why, but 2 events are likely: [1] erosion of old anthrax
graves; and [2] the rising water table bringing buried spores up to
the surface and into the rootmass of the grazing, which is now easily
ripped apart by any grazing cow.
