Flu drugs relatively safe for pregnant and breast-feeding women
---------------------------------------------------------------
The antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza are relatively safe for use
in pregnant and breastfeeding women, say the authors of a review of
data that includes previously unpublished evidence. [Tamiflu and
Relenza are proprietary preparations of the neuraminidase inhibitor
oseltamivir. Tamiflu is administered orally and Relenza intranasally.
- Mod.CP]. The analysis, published electronically on Mon 15 Jun 2009
by the Canadian Medical Association Journal, suggested Tamiflu is the
best bet for pregnant women, but either drug can be used safely by
breastfeeding women who come down with influenza.

The review may assuage concerns of women who contract swine [H1N1]
flu and are worried about whether or not to use antiviral drugs.
Pregnant women are at higher risk of complications than their
non-pregnant peers when they catch seasonal flu. Evidence from some
previous pandemics suggests they can be hit disproportionately hard
by a strain of pandemic influenza.

"During the current pandemic, we shouldn't hesitate to treat those
patients at increased risk," said senior author Dr Shinya Ito, head
of the division of clinical pharmacology and toxicology at Toronto's
Hospital for Sick Children. "In terms of risk-benefit ratio I think
it's very clear that the benefit is much more significant to use the
drug for pregnant women, even in the 1st trimester."

The authors, from the Motherisk Program at Sick Kids and the Japan
Drug Information Institute in Pregnancy, examined the available data
on antiviral drug use in pregnant and breast-feeding women. They
admitted the evidence is limited and said it will be important to
monitor what happens with antiviral drug usage by pregnant women
during the pandemic. In addition to looking at reports of use filed
to the drug makers after the fact, they found unpublished Japanese
data that followed 90 pregnant women who took Tamiflu during the 1st
trimester of their pregnancies. The 1st trimester is the period when
concern is greatest that chemicals or drugs a mother is exposed to or
takes could have a detrimental effect on the developing fetus. Of
those women, only one gave birth to a child with a birth defect. The
rate of birth defects in the general population is between 1 to 3 per
cent. Given that the rate among Tamiflu users isn't higher, it
suggests the single case occurred by chance, not as a result of
exposure to the drug.

In another study, scientists used a human placenta to see if Tamiflu
introduced to the placenta would flow to the fetus. Ito said it took
a high concentration of Tamiflu to see even small concentrations of
drugs coming out the other end.

The authors suggested Tamiflu is probably the better choice of the 2
flu drugs to give pregnant women infected with this new strain of
H1N1 flu, because there is more safety data on its use in pregnancy.
But they said for women who are breastfeeding, either Tamiflu or
Relenza could be used because only small amounts are excreted in
breast milk.

The paper said neither drug appears to affect the growth or
development of fetuses exposed to them in the womb. The US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention said last week [week of 2 Jun
2009] that it's receiving reports that some pregnant women who catch
swine [H1N1] flu are refusing to take antiviral drugs out of fear it
might put their fetuses at risk.

[The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted
emergency approval for the use of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) for the
treatment or prevention of 2009 influenza A (H1N1), H1N1 influenza
(flu) -- also known as swine flu. Oseltamivir may be used in adults
and children (including those younger than 1 year of age) for the
treatment or prevention of H1N1 flu. For specific information about
the use of oseltamivir for H1N1 flu, see the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) website at
