The whole of the Balkan region is facing big problems with virus infection. CMV (cucumber mosaic virus) is the primary problem, and the secondary being TSWV [tomato spotted wilt virus] on peppers [capsicum]. The problems are especially big in unheated greenhouses.

Due to excessive virus damage, the [2018] season is turning out to be very bad. Middle of May [2018] symptoms appeared first on the top of the plants, then on the fruits, which stay small and deformed with brown-red stripes. All types of pepper were infected.

The yield decreased to 40 per cent. Some growers even had to deal with an 80 per cent loss. The problems are ongoing and the quality of the products remains unstable. Many of these fruits are not marketable at all, not even for processing. Breeders are currently working on resistances, but it will not be there any time soon.

[_Cucumber mosaic virus_ (CMV; type member of genus _Cucumovirus_) is found worldwide affecting a large number of hosts, including many crops. It exists in numerous strains which may vary in their host range, symptoms and means of transmission. In most hosts, it produces a systemic infection affecting newly formed tissues. It is one of the most important viruses of capsicum crops. In early infections, both quality and quantity of fruit are affected. CMV can be transmitted by more than 60 species of aphids. It can also be spread with infected plant material and very effectively by mechanical means (for example, on infected agricultural tools). Seed transmission to varying degrees has also been reported in some host species, including some weeds which also serve as virus reservoirs. Disease management is difficult, since aphid vectors and virus reservoirs are widespread. Use of certified virus free planting material is essential. Control of weeds surrounding cropped fields has shown some success. Host resistance is available in some crops but may only be effective against some of the virus strains.

_Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV; type species of genus _Tospovirus_) has one of the broadest host ranges among plant viruses and is one of few affecting both dicot and monocot hosts. It can cause total crop loss and early symptoms are often difficult to diagnose. TSWV is transmitted by various species of thrips, but is not seed transmitted. Transmission by mechanical means has been reported and weed species can serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes vector control, use of clean planting material, control of weed hosts of virus and vectors and phytosanitary measures. Host resistance breaking strains of TSWV on capsicum and tomato cultivars have been reported in recent years.
