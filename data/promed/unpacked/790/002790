On September 10, the cruise ship Westerdam (Holland-America Line) docked
in Montreal at the end of a 10 day cruise from New York City with
approximately 1400 passengers and 600+ crew. While nearly all passengers
dispersed to their homes or other destinations, seven passengers sought
immediate medical attention at the Royal Victoria and Montreal General
Hospitals. An additional two passengers also sought care later that
evening. Of the nine passengers seeking care, six were hospitalized with
symptoms, signs and X-ray findings compatible with an atypical community
acquired pneumonia. The differential diagnosis included _Legionella_.
All patients were between 70 and 85 years of age, reflecting the generally
advanced age of all the passengers.
Additional information from the ship's medical log indicated that
approximately 100-110 medical consultations by approximately 35
passengers and 33 crew members had occurred in the two days prior to
docking in Montreal. Two crew members were taking antibiotics, one for
pneumonia and one for bronchitis.
Because the ship was about begin boarding another cohort of 1400 passengers
and _Legionnella_ could not be ruled out as an etiological agent for the
cluster of cases of pneumonia, the Company voluntarily delayed the boarding
and departure time for the ship, at the request of Health Canada, until
additional diagnostic testing could be performed.
Urine antigen assays for _Legionnella_ (Binex commercial assay and an
in-house assay for multiple serogroups developed by the Ontario Provincial
Public Health Laboratory) were performed on the six hospitalized patients
and the 33 crew members who had reported
respiratory symptoms during the cruise. All tests by both assays were
negative for _Legionella_.
Because of the uniformly negative laboratory results and other
considerations, we decided that the public health risk to the passengers
about to board the vessel was minimal and that the ship could proceed
with its cruise. The ship departed Montreal at approximately 4 pm,
September 11, 1997, after a delay of approximately 24 hrs.
LCDC received collaboration from local and provincial medical and public
health authorities as well as the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. LCDC and CDC will jointly monitor the occurrence of any
excess respiratory illness by consulting with the ship's doctor at each
port of call for the duration of the current cruise.
