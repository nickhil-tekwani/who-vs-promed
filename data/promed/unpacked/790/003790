On 15 September 1998, the Danish Institute for Virus Research,
Lindholm, reported that further characterisation of the virus strain
isolated had been performed by the Central Veterinary Laboratory,
Weybridge, United Kingdom.
The strain is the European bat lyssavirus type EBL-1a, which is
identical to the bat rabies virus that is isolated sporadically from
Danish bats.
The sheep flock in which the case occurred is still under
restrictions, i.e. no animals can leave the holding without a permit
from the Danish Veterinary Service. No other animals have shown any
clinical signs of rabies.
