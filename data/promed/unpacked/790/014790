Other typhus diseases include:
-California pseudotyphus or cat flea typhus is caused by _Rickettsia felis_;
-Indian tick typhus, Kenya tick typhus, Mediterranean tick typhus,
and other synonyms caused by _R. conorii_;
-Queensland tick typhus, North Queensland tick typhus caused by _R. australis_;
-Siberian tick typhus, North Asian tick typhus caused by _R. sibirica_.
-Russian endemic typhus is non-rickettsial and is a synonym for

I would add (South) African tick typhus to your list of 5 on the
recent ProMED-mail post. This disease is caused by _R. africae_,
which is transmitted by ticks. The disease is similar to RMSF (Rocky
Mountain Spotted Fever), but patients often have multiple eschars,
and like other rickettsial illnesses, it responds to doxycycline.
This is probably more common in Africa than RMSF is in the USA. We
see it in travelers who go on safari or trekking in endemic areas.
