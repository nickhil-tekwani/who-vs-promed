No fewer than 10 students of Ebonyi State University (EBSU), Abakaliki, were hospitalised at the Federal Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, (FETHA) on [Mon 23 Mar 2015] after eating local delicacy prepared with cooked cassava tuber (African salad).

The students of the CAS campus of the EBSU were said to have started stooling [diarrhea] immediately after the meal. They were rushed to the hospital when their health condition started deteriorating as it was gathered that the delicacy was infected with cholera. [Cholera does not cause immediate diarrhea. - Mod.TG]

The Director Rural Health, Ministry of Health, Dr Christian Achi, explained that the delicacy eaten by the students might have been contaminated by flies within the environment.

"This may be a case of cholera. The food they ate was already infected following the activity of flies that go around perching on food items and dirty substances.

"I want to urge the people of the state to cook and eat in their homes; they should not expose their food and cooking utensils to flies. They should maintain hygiene and avoid dirty environment." [Within] about a month, 6 people were dead of cholera in the state while 8 others were hospitalised.

The communities affected include Edomia, Amachi, and Ikelegu. 4 died in Amachi, Abakaliki Local Government Area; 2 died in Edomia and Ikelegu, Ebonyi Local Government Area.

Describing the situation as unfortunate, Achi had revealed that 8 persons were hospitalised and currently receiving treatment in nearby health centres.

Achi said government health officials had moved into the affected communities and stabilised some of the victims in critical condition.

[The main toxic principle which occurs in varying amounts in all parts of the cassava plant is a chemical compound called linamarin (Nartey, 1981). It often coexists with its methyl homologue called methyl-linamarin or lotaustralin. Linamarin is a cyanogenic glycoside which is converted to toxic hydrocyanic acid or prussic acid when it comes into contact with linamarase, an enzyme that is released when the cells of cassava roots are ruptured. Otherwise linamarin is a rather stable compound which is not changed by boiling the cassava. If it is absorbed from the gut to the blood as the intact glycoside it is probably excreted unchanged in the urine without causing any harm to the organism (Philbrick, 1977). However, ingested linamarin can liberate cyanide in the gut during digestion.

Hydrocyanic acid or HCN is a volatile compound. It evaporates rapidly in the air at temperatures over 28 deg C (82.4 deg F) and dissolves readily in water. It may easily be lost during transport, storage and analysis of specimens. The normal range of cyanogen content of cassava tubers falls between 15 and 400 mg HCN/kg fresh weight (Coursey, 1973). The concentration varies greatly between varieties and also with environmental and cultural conditions. The concentration of the cyanogenic glycosides increases from the centre of the tuber outwards (Bruijn, 1973). Generally the cyanide content is substantially higher in the cassava peel. Bitterness is not necessarily a reliable indicator of cyanide content.

Traditional processing and cooking methods for cassava can, if efficiently carried out, reduce the cyanide content to non-toxic levels. An efficient processing method will release the enzyme linamarase by disintegrating the microstructure the cassava root. On bringing this enzyme into contact with linamarin the glucoside is converted into hydrogen cyanide. The liberated cyanide will dissolve in the water when fermentation is effected by prolonged soaking, and will evaporate when the fermented cassava is dried. Sun drying fresh cassava pieces for short periods is an inefficient detoxification process. Cyanide will not be completely liberated and the enzyme will be destroyed during drying. Sun drying processing techniques reduce only 60 to 70 percent of the total cyanide content in the 1st 2 months of preservation. Cyanide residues can be quite high in the dry tubers, from 30 to 100 mg/kg (Casadei, 1988). Simple boiling of fresh root pieces is not always reliable since the cyanide may be only partially liberated, and only part of the linamarin may be extracted in the cooking water. The reduction of cyanides depends on whether the product is placed in cold water (27 deg C/81 deg F) or directly into boiling water (100 deg C/212 deg F). After 30 minutes cooking, the remaining cyanides are, in the 1st case, 8 percent of the initial value, and in the 2nd case about 30 percent (Easers, 1986)

Symptoms appear 4 hours to hours after consumption of raw or insufficiently processed cassava and consist of vertigo, vomiting, collapse, and in some cases death within 1 or 2 hours. Treatment is quite effective and cheap. The principle is to increase the detoxicating capacity of the patient by giving an intravenous injection of thiosulphate and thereby making more sulphur available for conversion of cyanide to thiocyanate.

Please note there is no mention of diarrhea occurring almost immediately after ingestion with cassava poisoning. So it is possible this may be some other toxin associated with the meal or some bacterial contamination. Most cassava poisoning patients report tingling in the extremities and this article does not mention that a s clinical sign.

More information on the possible etiology of this outbreak would be greatly appreciated.
