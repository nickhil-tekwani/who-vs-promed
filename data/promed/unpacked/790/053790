Meet ProMED-mail staff at ICID, Cancun, Mexico, 4-7 March 2004
--------------------------------------------------------------
There is still time to submit an abstract for the 11th International
Congress on Infectious Diseases (ICID) before the 1 December deadline. The
11th ICID will be held in Cancun from 4-7 March 2004. The congress is one
of the world's leading forums for the exchange of infectious disease
advances and is unique in its ability to draw physicians, scientists, and
public health officials from a range of backgrounds and countries. Based on
previous congresses, about 3500 people from over 100 countries are expected
to attend the 11th ICID.
An outstanding international faculty of 137 speakers from 29 countries has
been assembled to participate in symposia that will cover developments in
such areas as: vaccines and diagnostics for SARS and agents of
bioterrorism, emerging viral diseases, infectious disease surveillance, HIV
prevention and treatment, malaria, dengue, travel medicine, genomics and
proteomics, antimicrobial resistance, foodborne pathogens, infection
control, and sepsis. The ProMED-mail editorial staff will also be at the
11th ICID to meet with subscribers and to discuss new developments in
ProMED-mail.
The 11th ICID program will include 6 plenary lectures, 36 symposia,
posters, workshops, and meet-the-professor sessions. The plenary speakers
for the 11th ICID are Shizuo Akira of Japan, Paul Farmer of the United
States, Eduardo Gotuzzo of Peru, Adrian Hill of the United Kingdom, Rino
Rappuoli of Italy, and Jaime Sepulveda of Mexico.
Professor Akira of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases at Osaka
University is a leader in the understanding of mechanisms of innate
immunity. Dr Farmer, the Maude and Lillian Presley professor of medical
anthropology at Harvard Medical School, is a pioneer in providing effective
treatments for multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis and HIV in some of the
poorest communities in the world. Dr Gotuzzo, director of the Institute of
Tropical Medicine in Lima, is a leading researcher in the epidemiology and
treatment of many tropical diseases including HTLV-1. Professor Hill, the
Wellcome Trust principal research fellow at the University of Oxford, has
substantially advanced the understanding of genetics in the susceptibility
to infectious diseases. Dr Rappuoli, head of Chiron Vaccine Research, is a
pioneer in using knowledge of bacterial genomes to create novel vaccines.
Dr Sepulveda, the director general of the National Institute of Public
Health in Mexico, has played a leading role in public health projects such
as the eradication of polio from Mexico.
The abstract deadline is 1 December 2003. To submit an abstract or to see a
complete listing of the 11th ICID scientific program, go to the Society's
website at <http://www.isid.org>.
The scientific program of the 11th ICID has been reviewed and approved for
Category 1 credit toward the American Medical Association (AMA) Physician's
Recognition Award. The AMA will approve this educational activity for a
maximum number of Category 1 credits. Each physician should claim only
those credits he/she actually spent in the educational activity. One credit
may be claimed for each hour of participation.

[This is likely to be a very exciting meeting and will cover many topics of
interest to ProMED-mail subscribers. ProMED-mail will be taking part in a
symposium entitled "challenges to the global surveillance of infectious
diseases." In addition, ProMED-mail moderators and editors will be on hand,
providing live demos of the ProMED-mail website and our upcoming mapping
capabilities. We hope to get a chance to meet some of our readers and
contributors. It is not too late to submit an abstract, and this can be
done online at the ISID website. - Mod.LM]
