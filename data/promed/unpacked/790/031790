An investigation has begun into a rise in cases of the potentially deadly legionnaires' disease in one part of Wales. Public Health Wales has confirmed that 11 cases have been identified in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan over the past 12 months.

Public Health Wales has stressed that each case in Barry has been "extensively investigated" and does not meet the definition of a legionnaires' disease outbreak.

Officials added there is no evidence any of the cases are linked and many have individual risk factors for acquiring their infection -- such as travel abroad. However, Public Health Wales and partner agencies are advising employers to check their [legionellosis] policies and practices to ensure they are compliant.

Dr Lowe added: "Most cases of legionnaires' disease notified to us are sporadic cases, but unexplained clustering does occur from time-to-time. We are closely monitoring this situation, continue to investigate cases and will keep the status of this incident under review."

There are on average around 30 cases of legionnaires' disease in Wales each year, usually spread throughout Wales.

[The 11 cases that have been identified in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan over the past 12 months are said to be unrelated, but no mention is made of genotyping the clinical or environmental _Legionella_ isolates. Matching clinical genotypes will establish a cluster of cases with a common source and matching clinical and environmental isolates will establish a source responsible for the particular cluster.

Barry, with a population of 54 673 residents in 2016, is a seaside resort town in the Vale of Glamorgan, Wales, on the north coast of the Bristol Channel approximately 9 miles (14 km) south-southwest of Cardiff (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry,_Vale_of_Glamorgan).
