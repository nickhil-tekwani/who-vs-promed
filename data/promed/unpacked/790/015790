On [Sun 28 Oct 2018] District Collector P.S. Pradyumna directed the Animal Husbandry Department officials to immediately undertake the vaccination drive for cattle in a radius of 10 km [approx. 6 mi] with Kodandaramapuram village of Karveti Nagaram mandal as the epicentre of the suspected anthrax outbreak. During an emergency meeting with the officials of Animal Husbandry, Medical and Health, Revenue, Panchayat Raj and other line departments, the Collector instructed the HoDs to launch the vaccination drive for the cattle on a war-footing. He also ordered to continue the medical camp and door-to-door survey at the villages where as many as 7 suspected human anthrax cases emerged on [26 Oct 2018].

Joint director (Animal Husbandry) S. Venkat Rao told The Hindu that based on the instructions of the Collector, 13 000 vaccination doses were procured from other government veterinary hospitals, though the requirement was about 10 000 doses.

The official observed that the death of cattle at Kodandaramapuram village was 1st detected on [18 Oct 2018], followed by a series of casualties. "At that time of cattle casualties, the field staff of all other line departments were present," he said, rejecting the version of some area medical officers that they had not been informed about the cattle deaths. Mr. Venkat Rao said that while reaching out to the suspected villages, the field staff were finding some resistance from the villagers, as "they thought that the reports of suspected anthrax prevalence in their villages is being seen as a stigma".

Senior medical officer (Government Hospital, Puttur) said that special teams were on the job of searching for the meat stocks in the surrounding villages of Kodandaramapuram as some residents had reportedly shifted the stocks outside. "We have already searched several houses and the meat found was destroyed. An appeal was also made to the public in Karveti Nagaram mandal through the field officials to destroy the dried or stored meat," he said.

Meanwhile, no fresh case of suspected anthrax was reported anywhere in the Karveti Nagaram mandal on [Sun 21 Oct 2018]

[Vaccination at last! Well, better late than never but we have yet to see any laboratory confirmation that anthrax was responsible for the dead cattle that were butchered.
