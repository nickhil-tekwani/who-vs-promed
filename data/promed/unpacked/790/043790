Vaccinia (Smallpox) Vaccine: Recommendations of the ACIP, 2001
[excerpts
----------------------------------------------------------------------
---
These revised recommendations regarding vaccinia (smallpox) vaccine
update the previous [US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) recommendations (MMWR 1991;40; No. RR-14:1-10) and include
current information regarding the non-emergency use of vaccinia
vaccine among laboratory and health-care workers occupationally
exposed to vaccinia virus, recombinant vaccinia viruses, and other
orthopoxviruses that can infect humans.
In addition, this report contains ACIP's recommendations for the use
of vaccinia vaccine if smallpox (variola) virus were used as an agent
of biological terrorism or if a smallpox outbreak were to occur for
another unforeseen reason.
Variola virus is the etiological agent of smallpox. During the
smallpox era, the only known reservoir for the virus was humans; no
known animal or insect reservoirs or vectors existed. The most
frequent mode of transmission was person-to-person, spread through
direct deposit of infective droplets onto the nasal, oral, or
pharyngeal mucosal membranes, or the alveoli of the lungs from close,
face-to-face contact with an infectious person. Indirect spread (i.e.,
not requiring face-to-face contact with an infectious person) through
fine-particle aerosols or a fomite [object containing the virus was
less common.
Vaccinia vaccine is a highly effective immunizing agent that enabled
the global eradication of smallpox... As a result, recommendations for
routine smallpox vaccination were rescinded in 1971. In 1976, the
recommendation for routine smallpox vaccination of health-care workers
was also discontinued. In 1982, the only active licensed producer of
vaccinia vaccine in the United States discontinued production for
general use, and in 1983, distribution to the civilian population was
discontinued. All military personnel continued to be vaccinated, but
that practice ceased in 1990. Since January 1982, smallpox vaccination
has not been required for international travelers, and International
Certificates of Vaccination forms no longer include a space to record
smallpox vaccination.
Currently, international concern is heightened regarding the potential
use of smallpox (variola) virus as a bioterrorism agent. Because of
these concerns, ACIP has developed recommendations for vaccinia
(smallpox) vaccine regarding the potential use of smallpox virus as a
biological weapon. Additionally, recommendations regarding vaccination
of persons working with highly attenuated strains or recombinant
vaccines derived from highly attenuated strains of vaccinia virus have
been revised.
VACCINIA VACCINE
Dryvax,Â® the vaccinia (smallpox) vaccine currently licensed in the
United States, is a lyophilized, live-virus preparation of infectious
vaccinia virus (Wyeth Laboratories, Inc., Marietta, Pennsylvania).
***** Vaccinia vaccine does not contain smallpox (variola) virus.
*****
Previously, the vaccine had been prepared from calf lymph with a seed
virus derived from the New York City Board of Health (NYCBOH) strain
of vaccinia virus and has a minimum concentration of 108 pock-forming
units (PFU)/ml. Vaccine was administered by using the
multiple-puncture technique with a bifurcated needle. A reformulated
vaccine, produced by using cell-culture techniques, is now being
developed.
SMALLPOX VACCINE FOR BIOTERRORISM PREPAREDNESS
Although use of biological agents is an increasing threat, use of
conventional weapons (e.g., explosives) is still considered more
likely in terrorism scenarios. Moreover, use of smallpox virus as a
biological weapon might be less likely than other biological agents
because of its restricted availability; however, its use would have
substantial public health consequences. Therefore, in support of
current public health bioterrorism preparedness efforts, ACIP has
developed the following recommendations if this unlikely event occurs.
Surveillance
A suspected case of smallpox is a public health emergency... A
suspected smallpox case should be reported immediately by telephone to
state or local health officials and advice obtained regarding
isolation and laboratory specimen collection. State or local health
officials should notify CDC immediately if a suspected case of
smallpox is reported... [Countries should immediately notify the World
Health Organization also. - Mod.JW
Because of ... healthcare-associated smallpox transmission from
imported cases present in a hospital setting, health officials should
be diligent regarding use of adequate isolation facilities and
precautions.
Currently, specific therapies with proven treatment effectiveness for
clinical smallpox are unavailable. Medical care of more seriously ill
smallpox patients would include supportive measures only...
Pre-release Vaccination
The risk for smallpox occurring as a result of a deliberate release by
terrorists is considered low, and the population at risk for such an
exposure cannot be determined. Therefore, pre-exposure vaccination is
not recommended for any group other than laboratory or medical
personnel working with non-highly attenuated Orthopoxviruses (see
Routine Nonemergency Vaccine Use)...
Post-release Vaccination
If an intentional release of smallpox (variola) virus does occur,
vaccinia vaccine will be recommended for certain directly exposed
groups and other persons who have an increased likelihood of contact
with infectious materials from a smallpox patient (e.g., personnel
responsible for medical waste disposal, linen disposal or
disinfection, and room disinfection in a facility where smallpox
patients are present)...
Persons who have received a previous vaccination (i.e., childhood
vaccination or vaccination more than 3 years before) against smallpox
might demonstrate a more accelerated immune response after
revaccination than those receiving a primary vaccination. If possible,
these persons should be revaccinated and assigned to patient care
activities in the early stages of a smallpox outbreak until additional
personnel can be successfully vaccinated...
