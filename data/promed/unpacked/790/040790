Up to 130 people, including a 3-year-old boy, may have gotten ill from salmonellosis in [contaminated] ground beef in an outbreak that was kept hidden from the public until now. Metroxpress obtained access to documents that reveal that ground beef infected with multi resistant salmonella was sold by the Vejen-based food company Skare in June 2014. Skare delivered the beef to stores on 13 Jun 2014 but did not recall it as required by law when an analysis the following day found the presence of salmonellae.

According to the Danish State Serum Institute (SSI), 19 people, including the 3-year-old, reported being ill just days later. Beyond the 19 registered cases, SSI estimates that up to 130 people may have been sickened by the tainted meat. "6 of the 19 were so sick that they were hospitalized," SSI's Kare Molbak told Metroxpress.

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestrylsen) first traced the infection to Skare a full 40 days after the meat was sent to stores, but the food authorities did not require a recall. Neither Skare nor Fodevarestrylsen will tell consumers where the meat was sold.

"This is confidential information, the release of which would cause considerable economic harm to the company," Fodevarestrylsen wrote, according to Metroxpress.
