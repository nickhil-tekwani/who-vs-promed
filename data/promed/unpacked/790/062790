A recurrence of a mysterious fatal disease affecting cattle in the Hay district and elsewhere has put the Department of Primary Industries (DPI) on a war footing.

The disease, which 1st hit stock in the Western Division in 2006 before striking again toward the end of 2009, has DPI experts baffled, with an investigation now in the hands of the department's animal biosecurity unit. "To date, laboratory tests have returned inconclusive, and further sampling is underway," a DPI spokesperson said in a statement.

"An expert panel has been convened to investigate the deaths and includes an epidemiologist, virologist, and animal biosecurity staff."

The DPI response is a necessary move that has come at the end of a difficult-to-fathom delay, according to Mossgiel grazier Terry Huntly, who has suffered significant stock losses in each of the outbreaks.

"If they (DPI) are worried about the beef industry, there should have been more emphasis on finding out what it is," he said. "This time, it started in October 2013 and has been going ever since. I've lost 32 head from one mob of 68."

The mystery illness has hit herds located west of Hay, both to the north and south.

"Up at Nymagee (south of Cobar), I hear they've been burning bodies," said Mr Huntly, who has been gathering information from affected graziers across a wide area. "People have shot a lot of cattle and buried a lot of cattle. 300-plus head have died, and that's just what I know of."

A call from the DPI for producers to "contact their private veterinarian or Livestock Health and Pest Authority" should they notice "any unusual signs in their cattle, including drooling, diarrhoea, or sudden death" included in yesterday's [30 Dec 2013] statement was the 1st public warning of any kind to graziers, according to Mr Huntly.

This year's [2013] outbreak has shown no sign of abating, and investigative work has intensified, according to DPI senior veterinary officer Western Division Greg Curran. "We are building on what we've learned in previous outbreaks," he said. "Terry Huntly has put a lot of work into this issue. He's has been a great conduit between graziers and authorities in the transfer of information."

The possibility that an unidentified disease killing cattle in western NSW could be responsible for fatalities in others species, including wildlife, will be investigated by the Department of Primary Industries.

Responding to a 3rd outbreak of the killer illness, the DPI has set up an expert panel to investigate the stock deaths.

DPI senior veterinary officer Western Division Greg Curran yesterday [30 Dec 2013] said tests would be carried out to determine whether there was a link with sheep, crow, and rabbit deaths. "We've just picked up on it this year [2013] and haven't had the chance to investigate, but there are unusual and important reports coming out of the field," he said. "We are hearing about crows dying after scavenging on the cattle carcasses, and people are noticing rabbits dying at about the same time as stock are affected. It might be something else entirely because, with the focus on something like this (in cattle), it's easy to draw too much of a conclusion, but we're investigating."

Observations surrounding cattle fatalities were both disturbing and intriguing, he said. "This year [2013], we've begun to see what we call 3D: drooling, diarrhoea, and death. Most animals affected die. What really strikes a vet when the (dead) animals are opened up is the number of organs affected, and we consistently see damage to the esophagus, which is really unusual."

Fast Facts:
Indicators of the disease in cattle
* lack of appetite, calves won't suckle
* ears held forward
* watery eyes
* diarrhoea, drooling
* death within 72 hours
* Clinical signs in any individual animal could be mistaken as indicative of other diseases such as black leg, salmonella, shipping fever, or bovine viral death (BVD).
* Necropsies reveal extensive damage to the esophagus and all other organs and muscle tissue breakdown.

[These unusual situations occurred in 2006, 2007, and in 2010. It seems to be somewhat of a sporadic condition, or we would hear about it more than every 3-4 years.

Certainly, we hope the investigation produces more fruit than the previous investigations and outbreaks. What kinds of investigations have been done in the past? Do they shed any light on this situation? Do these animals have a fever? Are they off feed before showing signs of illness? Do all affected areas have anything in common? Water? Hay? Feed? Is the same area being affected at the same time of year? Are weather conditions similar each year? Rain? Drought? Mold on hay?

If there seems to be any commonality or if any infectious/toxic/new syndrome is identified, we would appreciate knowing about it.
