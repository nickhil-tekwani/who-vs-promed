Measles cases in England and Wales: update to end-January 2012
-------------------------------------------------------
The number of confirmed cases of measles in England and Wales with an onset date in January 2012 continues the decline observed at the end of 2011; only 37 cases were confirmed in January 2012 compared to 66 and 57 cases respectively for November and December 2011. The majority of cases reported in January were from the South East region. On-going investigations into a cluster of cases in the Liverpool area and a second unlinked cluster in North Wales [see following report] suggest that there will be a rise in confirmed cases during February.

A total of 1086 laboratory confirmed measles cases were reported in England and Wales in 2011, compared to 380 in 2010 and 1,144 in 2009. The highest numbers of confirmed cases were reported in London and South East regions. In the last two years there has been a shift to cases occurring in older children (>14 years) and adults; around 40% in both 2010 and 2011 compared to just under 20% in 2009. In 2011, 14% of cases were associated with recent travel or household contact with individuals recently returning from travel abroad.

Measles outbreak at Porthmadog school reaches twelve
----------------------------------------------
The take-up of the MMR jab following an outbreak of measles in Porthmadog proved to be "very popular" yesterday (Wednesday). Twelve pupils have so far been clinically diagnosed with measles at Ysgol Eifionydd in Porthmadog, with headteacher Alwen Watkin stating she had never before seen a similar outbreak in her 20 year career.

Measles is a serious and highly contagious viral disease that can cause complications including pneumonia, meningitis and encephalitis. Mrs Watkin said: "This is the first time I've seen such an outbreak. The school was informed by a parent during last week's half term break that two children had been affected, and this number grew quickly during the course of the week."

Public Health Wales reported that the 12 pupils diagnosed with measles had either received no MMR vaccination or only one dose. The body's consultant in communicable disease control, Dr Chris Whiteside, called for parents in North Wales who have not arranged immunisation for their children to act immediately to get them vaccinated.

He said: "Measles is highly contagious and spreads very easily. We would therefore expect to see more cases. As long as there are children who have not had their two MMR vaccinations, there is the potential for people to become ill with measles. "There is then a danger for the disease to spread to unvaccinated friends, family or others who cannot be vaccinated due to existing health problems, and who are therefore highly vulnerable to measles infection."

Mrs Watkin added: "Other pupils are ill at the moment, but we can't yet confirm whether they have measles or not. "I know that many parents make a conscious decision not to immunise their children with the MMR jab. That's their choice, and we have to respect that, but if they do start showing symptoms, I'd ask them to stay away from the school, and to see their GP as soon as possible, as we don't want it to spread further around the school."

Ysgol Eifionydd held MMR and booster sessions for pupils who had not been vaccinated yesterday (Wednesday). Mrs Watkin said the sessions had proved "very popular".

British authorities fear measles outbreak in Sussex
------------------------------------------
British health authorities recently expressed concern that an outbreak of measles in Sussex could develop into a minor epidemic. Parents are being urged to make sure their children receive both doses of the measles vaccine in hopes that the spread of the illness can be blunted, according to The Argus (Brighton and Hove) newspaper.

In 2011, the county reported 172 measles cases, compared with fewer than 10 in 2010. There have been 16 cases confirmed so far this year. Most of the cases have been in school-age children who had not received both doses of the vaccine, and health officials worry that too many families remain unprotected.

Experts say that the outbreak may have been affected by outbreaks in popular vacation areas in Europe, including France and Bulgaria. It is thought that unvaccinated children may have acquired the infections while on holiday and returned to school where the disease infected others.

Low vaccination rates in some areas of the county, including the seaside resort of Brighton and Hove, have contributed to the outbreak. Brighton and Hove’s vaccination rate is only 80 percent, one of the lowest in England, though officials say it is fast improving.

“The high number of cases is a concern, especially as measles is a preventable disease,” Peter Wilkinson, a public health consultant with the U.K. National Health Service, according to the Argus. “We would advise people to make sure their children are up to date with their vaccinations as increasing take-up rates is the best way to reduce the chances of cases spreading.”

Measles outbreak kills at least 20 Afghan children
------------------------------------------
KABUL: Health officials Tuesday [21 Fb 2012] reported a deadly measles outbreak in rural western Afghanistan that they said was compounded by severe winter weather hampering access to the area. At least 20 children have died of of measles and pneumonia in Ghor and Badghis provinces, according to Afghanistan's Health Ministry and the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Health officials urged vaccinations for all children ages 9 months to 15 years, especially for those living in the affected areas and surrounding provinces. But in rural Afghanistan, parents are sometimes reluctant to have their children vaccinated because of an abundance of conspiracy theories about the shots. Some think healthcare providers are spies, or that the vaccines are meant to sicken people or will result in sterilisation.

As the outbreak has grown more serious, Afghan authorities and the WHO set up five temporary clinics and vaccinated more than 3600 children in the outbreak zone, while treating more than 6000 patients, health officials
said.

Measles and complications arising from it are among the leading causes of child mortality in Afghanistan. The disease is completely preventable through vaccines, but the overall rate of immunization remains low, particularly in the countryside and in areas hard hit by the insurgency.

Vaccinations for Children Urgent after Afghan Measles Outbreak
------------------------------------------------------
Severe weather and a low immunization cover combined with a measles outbreak has lead to a World Health Organization (WTO) call for all Afghan children to be vaccinated. According to a recent update from the WHO office in Afghanistan, children have died due to measles and pneumonia in the two western provinces of Ghor and Baghdis.

The outbreak of the disease has led the agency to issue a statement that "Measles is fully preventable by a proven safe vaccination. We call on all Afghans to vaccinate their children." Measles is a highly infectious disease that occurs through the spread of nasal and oral fluids and causes complications and deaths, even in previously healthy individuals. It is one of the leading causes of death among young children even though a safe vaccine is available.

WHO and the Afghan public health ministry had set up temporary clinics to help contain the outbreak and administer the two doses of measles vaccine as recommended by WHO. Two are recommended as about 15 per cent of vaccinated children fail to develop immunity from the first dose.

So far, more than 6200 patients were treated by the medical emergency teams, and over 3600 measles vaccinations were administered. The WHO also stated that "This outbreak confirms that the overall immunisation coverage remains low, with disparities throughout Afghanistan, particularly between rural and urban areas, secure and insecure zones."

The WHO estimated that about 30 million cases and over 700 000 deaths from measles occur annually in developing countries. Most deaths follow complications such as pneumonia, croup and diarrhoea, and are also frequently associated with malnutrition.

Measles outbreak in Nalkheda village
-------------------------------
BHOPAL: With the advent of summer season, measles cases in the city have hit a yearly high. Fifty children were administered care after the disease was reported from Nalkheda village in Berasia here on Saturday [25 Feb 2012]

According to district chief medical and health officer (CMHO) Dr Pankaj Shulka, "About 50 children are suffering from measles in the village and an emergency team has been formed to tackle the outbreak of the disease." Health officials collected blood samples from the nearby areas after the CHMO visited the village on Saturday [25 Feb 2012]. However, according to the health workers, the cases of measles were not severe among the children as they had been immunised previously [presumably with a single dose of vaccine - Mod.CP]. Health officials said that measures are in place to bring the disease under control. Parents have been meanwhile asked to keep the affected children away from school. "This will prevent spreading of disease to other students," said a local resident.

Measles Cases Rise to 14 in Indiana
------------------------------
INDIANAPOLIS: An additional case of measles has been confirmed in Central Indiana, State health officials said today, bringing the total number of cases to 14. This case was initially reported on Friday 17 Feb 2012 by the City of Noblesville where the individual resides and works. The case had not been confirmed by the State Health Department at that time.

All confirmed cases of measles have a common association, meaning they all stem from the initial case, which was identified early February. State health officials would like to reiterate that, at this time, no measles cases have been reported as a result of the exposure which occurred at Super Bowl Village on 3 Feb 2012.

The Indiana State Department of Health continues to work with local health departments, health care providers, and all impacted organizations to identify additional cases of measles and to prevent further transmission of the disease.

The State Health Department says individuals may have been exposed to measles at the following places and dates:

- Menards on 96th St., Fishers (Feb. 11)

- Wal-mart on 96th St., Fishers (Feb. 11)

- Street Department, City of Noblesville (Feb. 8, 14,15, and 16)

State health officials have also recently learned that one of the earlier confirmed cases visited a Home School Basketball League tournament, on 6 Jan 2012, at Traders Point Christian Academy in Whitestown. Individuals who were exposed to measles at this event would have shown symptoms by 27 Jan 2012. If you feel you may have experienced measles from Jan. 6 through Jan. 27, contact your health care provider to let them know.

The Indiana State Department of Health has established a hotline to help answer questions from the general public. The hotline number is 1-877-826-0011 (TTY/TTD 1-888-561-0044).

Measles cases reach 15 in central Indiana
----------------------------------
INDIANAPOLIS: The number of measles cases in central Indiana has reached fifteen, the Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) reported Tuesday [21 Feb 2012] afternoon. ISDH says the latest case was confirmed in Hamilton County. The most recently confirmed case does not pose an increased risk of spreading the disease because the person has been in self-isolation since they were exposed.

"Through our investigation, we were made aware that this individual was exposed and may be at high risk for developing the disease," said State Health Commissioner Gregory Larkin, M.D. "This is good news, because since we knew about the exposure and risk, this person was able to stay home and avoid exposing anyone else while infectious."

This is the second outbreak of measles Indiana has experienced in less than a year. Measles is rare in the United States due to the widespread use of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine. "In general, when we experience measles in the United States, it's a result of an unvaccinated U.S. resident traveling abroad or a foreign visitor from a part of the world where measles is endemic," said State Health Commissioner Gregory Larkin, M.D. "Measles can and does happen in the U.S., but we can safely and easily protect ourselves by becoming vaccinated."

The Indiana State Department of Health has established a hotline to help answer questions from the general public. The hotline number is 1-877-826-0011 (TTY/TTD 1-888-561-0044). State Health Department staff will be on-hand during the hours of 8:15 a.m. to 4:45 p.m., Monday through Friday to answer questions. (Note: Immunization status cannot be verified through this hotline. Individuals unsure of vaccination status are encouraged to contact your health care provider, as they have access to the Indiana Immunization Registry).

If you are experiencing the symptoms of measles, stay home and call your doctor right away. Alert your doctor if you think you have been in contact with an infected person and be prepared to describe your symptoms. If you are ill with measles, remain home and away from others, especially unvaccinated infants, people with diseases affecting their immune systems, and pregnant women.

------------------------------------------
INDIANAPOLIS: State health officials confirmed another case of measles in Hamilton County today, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 16. The Indiana State Department of Health and local health departments continue surveillance and investigation related to this outbreak to prevent the further transmission of the disease and protect public health.

The State Health Department says individuals may have been exposed to measles at the following location and dates:

- Woodland Country Club, Carmel (Feb. 9,10, and 11)

Health officials are working with the Woodland Country Club to contact members and their guests to alert them to the potential risk of exposure. All individuals who think they may have been exposed to an individual with measles and are unsure of their vaccination status are encouraged to check their immunization status with their health care provider. Two properly administered doses of the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella vaccine are needed to be fully protected. Individuals born before 1957 are presumed to be immune to measles.
