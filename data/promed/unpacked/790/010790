A 46-year-old woman is dead, and 3 others are seriously ill after a
meningitis outbreak in Brooklyn, New York. It appears all 4 victims, 2
adults and 2 children, had attended a family BBQ over the weekend. Because
bacterial meningitis [meningococcal - Mod.LL] may spread within close
quarters, residents in the victim's building are concerned.
The health department says the only people who need to worry are those who
were in close physical contact with the 4 victims. The city says a doctor's
visit and medication should be enough protection.
But that's little reassurance for those who live at 940 Gates Avenue. There
is still plenty of fear and uncertainty for those who live in the Bed-Stuy
building.
One building resident said, "We don't know what's going on, but we had to
go to the hospital. The kids had to take shots, the adults had to take a
pill. What are we taking a pill for? Where's this coming from, is this
going to happen again or what?"
Three cases [aged 22, 12 and 12 - Mod.LL] who live in the building are in
the hospital. One of them, a child, is on a respirator.
Others who were at the barbecue are being treated medically, but there is
no indication that this infection has affected anyone else living in the
building.

The city Health Department says a new strain of bacterial meningitis is
circulating in Brooklyn, and it has already claimed 4 victims. Since late
December 2006, 9 cases have been diagnosed in the borough, including 4 who
died.
The Department of Health said recent patients with meningitis in Brooklyn
reported using street drugs or being in close contact with people who used
street drugs. The department says the general population is not at a higher
risk.

[ProMED would appreciate more information about these cases. The timing of
the onset of cases is not stated. It is possible that one of these was the
index case with transmission to the others. The capsular type of
meningococcus in the current cluster is not stated, but the 2nd post
implies that the same type involved in the earlier cases, type C was involved.
The following was extracted from CDC: Prevention and Control of
Meningococcal Disease - Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP). Morbid Mortal Week Rep 2005;54(RR-7):1-21.
[The citation numbers have been edited to be consecutive].
In the USA, greater than 98 percent of cases of meningococcal disease are
sporadic; however, since 1991, the frequency of localized outbreaks has
increased (1,2). The proportion of meningococcal cases caused by serogroup
Y increased from 2 percent during 1989-1991 (3) to 37 percent during
1997-2002 (CDC, unpublished data, 2004). Serogroups B, C, and Y are the
major causes of meningococcal disease in the USA, each being responsible
for approximately 1/3rd of cases. The proportion of cases caused by each
serogroup varies by age group. Among infants aged less than one year,
greater than 50 percent of cases are caused by serogroup B, for which no
vaccine is licensed or available in the USA (4,5). Of all cases of
meningococcal disease among persons aged greater than 11 years, 75 percent
are caused by serogroups (C, Y, or W-135), which are included in vaccines
available in the USA (CDC, unpublished data, 2004).
Since the early 1990s, outbreaks of meningococcal disease have occurred
with increasing frequency in the USA. During July 1994 - June 2002, a total
of 76 outbreaks were identified (annual median: 10; range: 4-16) (2),
including 48 (63 percent) outbreaks caused by serogroup C, 19 (25 percent)
by serogroup B, and 9 (12 percent) by serogroup Y. These outbreaks occurred
in 32 states and involved 247 patients (accounting for less than 2 percent
of total cases of meningococcal disease in the USA during this period). Of
the 76 outbreaks, 26 (34 percent) were community-based and accounted for 53
percent of all outbreak-related cases. Of the 50 (65 percent) outbreaks
that were organization-based, 13 (26 percent) occurred in colleges; 19 (38
percent) in primary and secondary schools; and 9 (18 percent) in nursing homes.
The attack rate for household contacts exposed to patients who have
sporadic meningococcal disease was estimated to be 4 cases/1000 persons
exposed, which is 500-800 times greater than the rate for the total
population (6).
Because the rate of secondary disease for close contacts is highest
immediately after onset of disease in the index patient, antimicrobial
chemoprophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible (ideally less
than 24 hours after identification of the index patient). Conversely,
chemoprophylaxis administered greater than 14 days after onset of illness
in the index patient is probably of limited or no value. Oropharyngeal or
nasopharyngeal cultures are not helpful in determining the need for
chemoprophylaxis and might unnecessarily delay institution of this
preventive measure.
Rifampin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftriaxone are 90-95 percent effective in
reducing nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and are all
acceptable antimicrobial agents for chemoprophylaxis (7-10). Systemic
antimicrobial therapy of meningococcal disease with agents other than
ceftriaxone or other 3rd-generation cephalosporins might not reliably
eradicate nasopharyngeal carriage of _N. meningitidis_. If other agents
have been used for treatment, the index patient should receive
chemoprophylactic antibiotics for eradication of nasopharyngeal carriage
before being discharged from the hospital (11).
One recent study has reported that a single 500-mg oral dose of
azithromycin was effective in eradicating nasopharyngeal carriage of _N.
meningitidis_ (12). Azithromycin, in addition to being safe and easy to
administer, is also available in a suspension form and is approved for use
among children. Further evaluation is warranted of both the effectiveness
of azithromycin in eradicating carriage of _N. meningitdis_ and potential
for development of microbial resistance to this drug if it is widely used
for chemoprophylaxis.
