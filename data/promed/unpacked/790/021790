Viet Nam reports suspected foot-and-mouth disease in pigs
-----------------------------------------------
Nearly 270 pigs in Viet Nam's southernmost Ca Mau province are suspected to
have died of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], a local newspaper reported on
Tuesday [5 Jul 2005].

Testing on 19 samples from 268 pigs that died last month [June 2005]
indicated that they could have been infected with FMD, according to the
Quan Doi Nhan Dan (People's Army) newspaper.

Nearly 1840 pigs in the province have been infected with common diseases
and suspected FMD in the last few months.

Local veterinary forces are strengthening vaccination among pigs and
tightening control over slaughterhouses. They vaccinated over 52 000 pigs
against common disease [hog cholera? - Mod.AS] in June [2005].

However, no effective treatment [sic: should probably read vaccination] for
the suspected FMD in Ca Mau is available now, the report said.

[FMD is known to be endemic in Viet Nam. According to the official
information duly provided by the Vietnamese authorities to the OIE during
2004, cattle, buffaloes and pigs were reportedly affected by serotypes O
and A. Data on the serotype involved with the current cases in pigs, with
special attention to serotype Asia 1, which seems to be prevalent in
neighboring China (see Laurence Gleeson's commentary in 20050520.1385 and
FAO's overview in 20050624.1774), will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
