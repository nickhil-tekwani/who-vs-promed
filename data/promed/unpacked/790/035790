Australian horse industries back on track
--------------------------------------------
The equine influenza (horse flu) outbreak in Australia is currently
contained and is on track for early eradication.

Australia's Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr. Andy Carroll said that due
to successful control programs undertaken by New South Wales (NSW)
and Queensland (QLD) veterinary authorities, the actions of
Australian horse industries and individual horse owners, the disease
is contained and large populations of horses have fully recovered.

"Since reaching a high of some 10 000 infected premises in
October/November last year [2007], we now have less than 1000
infected premises indicating that our strategy in combating the
disease has been highly successful," Dr. Carroll said.

The number of infected premises is continuing to rapidly decrease
with no new detections of the disease reported since 22 Dec 2007.

"This success will increasingly allow non-risk horses to move more
freely around Australia and combined with the use of vaccination, to
participate more freely in horse sales and other events," Dr. Carroll
said. "This is a great development in getting our horse industry and
horse sports back on track."

Importantly, the Australian racing industry has announced that
yearling sales will go ahead, offering a large selection of quality
horses, as per previous years. Arrangements for the re-opening of
Australia's export market are progressing with Biosecurity Australia
and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service negotiating
conditions with Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Iran, South
Africa and the United Arab Emirates.

Macau has provided amended conditions for the importation of horses
and the Philippines have agreed to conditions for horses purchased at
the Magic Millions and William Inglis sales. Negotiations with the
Philippines on arrangements that will allow for wider sourcing of
horses within Australia are continuing.

The United States, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland
and the Republic of Korea continue to import horses from Australia in
accordance with conditions in place prior to the outbreak.

Dr. Carroll said that while the control of the outbreak is good news
for all horse enthusiasts, adherence to biosecurity and movement
restriction arrangements are still the keys to successfully
eradicating the disease.

"We are winning the battle against the disease and we are
increasingly optimistic that horse flu will be eradicated much
earlier than previously expected. But, it only takes one person to do
the wrong thing and we could face a major setback," Dr. Carroll said.

[It has been a difficult few months for Australia in its process of
getting this disease under control and on the road to eradication.
Certainly as mentioned in this article, with 1000 infected premises
and any carelessness it could cause a set back. - Mod.TG]
