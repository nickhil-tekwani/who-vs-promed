In April this year [2014] in Georgia, 2 people died from Crimean-Congo [hemorrhagic] fever; both were females, one 34 and one 77 years old, said the head of the department of infectious diseases of the National Center for Disease Control, Hatuna Zahashvili.

According to the agency InterPressNews, just this year [2014] in Georgia, 5 cases of Crimean-Congo fever were reported.

"In 2014, 5 cases of Crimean-Congo fever have been reported. This is quite a serious disease, which is carried by [transmitted by] ticks. So far, cases have been recorded in Kartli and Samtskhe-Javakheti. It is known that Tbilisi is also an endemic area, as in past years, we have had cases of Crimean-Congo fever in the capital. This disease is mostly acquired after warming [temperatures], when ticks become active," said Zahashvili.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (also known as hemorrhagic fever Crimean-Congo-Khazer, Crimean-Congo fever, Central Asian hemorrhagic fever, karahalak) is an acute zoonotic viral disease associated with natural foci. It is characterized by a 2-phase fever, general intoxication, and a severe bleeding syndrome.

Reservoirs of the virus are wild small mammals: a wild mouse, a small squirrel, hares, and eared hedgehogs. Carriers and vectors are ticks, mainly of the genus _Hyalomma_. Disease occurrence is seasonal, peaking from May-August in our area. In 80 per cent of cases, ill persons are those aged 20-60 years. Mortality resulting from the disease is up to 40 per cent.

The incubation period lasts from 1-14 days (usually 2-7 days). The disease begins abruptly; the body temperature rises rapidly, and even in mild forms of the disease reaches 39-40 C [102-104 F]. The initial (pre-hemorrhagic) period is marked only by signs of intoxication, characteristic of many infectious diseases. The initial period often lasts 3-4 days (from 1-7 days). This period is marked by high fever, weakness, fatigue, body aches all over, and severe headache and pain in muscles and joints.

Less common manifestations include the initial period of dizziness, impaired consciousness, severe pain in the calf muscles, and signs of inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. In some patients, before the onset of the hemorrhagic period, characteristic symptoms of the disease occur, which are: repeated vomiting not related to food intake, lower back pain, and abdominal pain, mainly in the epigastric region.

A consistent symptom is fever, which lasts an average of 7-8 days, especially typical for the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever temperature curve. In particular, when the hemorrhagic syndrome appears, there is a marked reduction in body temperature; after 1-2 days, the body temperature rises again, a result characteristic for this disease, the "2-peak" temperature curve.

The hemorrhagic period corresponds to the period of febrile disease; its severity determines the severity and outcome of disease. In the majority of patients, on the 2nd-4th day of illness (at least on the 5th-7th day), hemorrhagic rash appears on the skin and mucous membranes with hematoma at the bite site, and there may be internal bleeding. Fever lasts for 10-12 days. Normalization of body temperature and cessation of bleeding characterizes the transition to a period of convalescence.

[This is the 2nd case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Georgia that ProMED-mail has posted. The 1st report was posted in September 2009. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20140418.2413017, CCHF virus is endemic in Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and Asia, in countries south of the 50th parallel north. CCHFV is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_. CCHF virus can cause severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent.

Mod.CP (see ProMED-mail archive 20130501.1684736) cited information summarized from a review in The Lancet by Talha Khan Burki (Lancet 2012; 380(9857): 1897-8. doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)62097-2; http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(12)62097-2/fulltext). In its immature form, the tick feeds on small mammals. Later, the adult tick attaches itself to cattle, sheep, goats, or human beings. Livestock show no overt signs of disease, and farmers and slaughterhouse workers have little idea they have been infected until they start expressing symptoms: dizziness, muscular pain, and stiffness, and of course the signature bleeding. Whereas infection in birds mostly tends to be abortive, ostriches are important hosts. In the mid 1990s, South Africa saw a CCHF outbreak at an ostrich abattoir.

About 30 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe have reported CCHF. The tick ventures no further than 50 degrees north latitude, which cuts across Russia, Ukraine, central Europe, and France; the latter 2 regions are not considered to be at any immediate risk; the _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks are present, but there is no serological evidence of CCHF. The distribution of known cases across the Middle East and Africa is patchy; ticks are present in the whole of this region, but in many countries, it seems harmless. In Africa, only South Africa, and from time to time Mauritania, face ongoing outbreaks; countries such as Tanzania and Uganda have not reported any recent outbreaks; and countries such as Angola and Algeria seem not to be at risk.

Only 4 countries report more than 50 cases per year: Iran, Russia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan (although, it could easily be the case that these countries simply have particularly efficient surveillance systems backed by proper diagnostics).
