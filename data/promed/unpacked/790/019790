The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) on [Thu 27 Jun 2019] confirmed one new case of measles in Taiwan, saying the patient had contracted the infection at a hospital.

The 7-month-old boy was at the emergency room of a hospital in central 8-9 Jun 2019, at the same time as a 1-year-old girl who had measles, the CDC said.

The boy was taken back to the hospital [Thu 27 Jun 2019] after he developed a rash on [21 Jun 2019], and follow-up tests confirmed that he was infected with the same strain of measles as the girl, the CDC said.

The girl is believed to have contracted measles during a visit to Viet Nam in March 2019, according to the CDC.

So far, 510 people who had contact with the 2 children have been identified and will be monitored by health authorities through [15 Jul 2019], the CDC said.

At the hospital, all personnel who have not been vaccinated against measles will be required to obtain the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, CDC Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang said.

So far this year [2019], there have been 101 confirmed cases of measles in Taiwan -- 66 locally acquired and 35 imported, according to CDC data.

Thailand, Viet Nam, and the Philippines are the top 3 sources of measles infections among Taiwanese, according to the CDC.

People who were in the Winnipeg Richardson International Airport [Manitoba] on 25 Jun 2019 may have been exposed to measles.

A travel-related case of measles has been reported in Manitoba.

According to the Chief Provincial Public Health Officer, the man, in his 30's, lives within the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and is recovering in hospital. It is believed he contracted the virus while travelling in the Philippines.

While the risk of transmission is low, people who were at the locations on the dates and times [listed at the URL above] may have been exposed to measles.

King county public health officials announced another confirmed case of measles on [Fri 28 Jun 2019] and warned that anyone who visited Seattle Children's emergency room or a Fred Meyer [hypermarket superstores] in Kent on certain days may have been exposed.

The child who was recently diagnosed is the 8th resident in King county to contract measles since the beginning of the year[2019], according to Public Health-Seattle & King County. The case is the 10th in Western Washington since an outbreak was declared in May [2019].

The child was at a Fred Meyer in Kent last week [week of 17 Jun 2019] and at Seattle Children's twice this week before being diagnosed, according to Public Health. Seattle Children's says they are notifying visitors and patients who may have been exposed.

Health officials are still working to determine the source of the child's measles and whether this case is connected to others in the area. Last month [May 2019], an infant was diagnosed with measles after she was brought to Seattle Children's emergency department.

The Western Washington measles outbreak began on 9 May 2019, with residents of Pierce, King, and Snohomish counties diagnosed after spending time at the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.

This year [2019], Washington has had 82 cases, or about 8% of the 1077 cases reported in the United States, which prompted state lawmakers to ban exemptions to the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine except for religious or medical reasons. Most of the state's cases were from a Clark county outbreak earlier this year.

This year [2019], the US has seen the most cases since 1992 and since measles was declared eliminated in 2000, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

A full list of exposure sites in King county can be found on Public Health's website at https://kingcounty.gov/depts/health/communicable-diseases/disease-control/measles/cases.aspx.

[5] DR Congo (Ituri): MSF

Urgent humanitarian response needed to unprecedented crises in northeast Democratic Republic of Congo
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple humanitarian crises are unfolding in Ituri province, northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and hundreds of thousands of people are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, according to international medical organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).

"This is not the 1st time there are urgent humanitarian needs in the area," says Dr Moussa Ousman, MSF Head of Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo. "But this time we are seeing not only mass displacement due to violence, but also a rapidly spreading measles outbreak and an Ebola epidemic that shows no signs of slowing down, all at the same time. This is unprecedented."

Intercommunal violence has been increasing in Ituri since December 2017, and the large majority of people displaced as a result have been in urgent need of humanitarian assistance, some for more than a year. Since October 2018, MSF has conducted 3 mortality surveys in the locations of Drodro, Nizzi, and Angumu. All showed that the mortality rates in these communities were far above emergency levels.

"Our surveys show that people are mainly dying from preventable diseases such as malaria, measles and diarrhoea," says Dr Ousman. "That is very worrying, especially as it has not yet been possible to vaccinate against measles because of the ongoing Ebola outbreak, and the fear of Ebola further spreading. Together with the ministry of health, we are looking at what innovative strategies we can implement given the circumstances, but more help is urgently needed here to prevent more deaths."

MSF is supporting the local ministry of health to provide medical care and respond to the most acute needs of the displaced in Drodro, Nizzi and Bunia. Our teams are also providing clean water, distributing relief items and constructing showers and latrines. Nevertheless, the most urgent needs of thousands of families remain unmet.

MSF urges for an immediate scale up of long-term humanitarian assistance, to prevent the loss of more lives and to ensure decent living conditions for all those who have been forced to flee.

When the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club hosts over 450 000 tennis fans between 1-13 Jul 2019, are patrons being required to present measles immunization proof prior to entry?

This question is relevant since 'The Championships, Wimbledon' is taking place in one of the world's measles hot-spots.

Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, up to 90 percent of the under-vaccinated people 'sitting' close to that person who are not immune, will also become infected.

During the 1st quarter of 2019, there were 231 confirmed cases of measles in the United Kingdom (UK). Which follows the 971 confirmed cases in 2018.

Specifically, the ongoing measles outbreak in greater London is primarily occurring in under-vaccinated communities, particularly those with links to other countries with ongoing measles outbreaks, such as France (1749) over the past year.

Alternatively, Wimbledon could offer its tennis patrons access to on-campus measles vaccination services.

A recent case-study for Wimbledon to emulate is the Indianapolis 500 race last May, which offered its 300 000 patrons easy access to on-campus, vaccination clinics.

[Free measles vaccination clinics at sporting events, especially those where families might attend, is an excellent approach. It would be interesting to know how many vaccinations were given at the Indy500 race referred to above. - Mod.LK
