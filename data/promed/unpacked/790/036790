An employee of the NINI retail store remains hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Italian Hospital in La Plata due to a possible case of [a] hantavirus [infection]. According to the statement of his co-workers, the man had acquired the disease in the store, where the presence of rodents was known.

The 35-year-old man was admitted to hospital this past 1 Dec [2014] with signs of a virus disease with multi-organ failure and remained hospitalized in the intensive care unit on mechanical respiration.

With this case, the Associate Director of Health Region XI of La Plata, Daniel D'Alessandro, explained that: "This is a suspected case of [a] hantavirus [infection], but there is no official confirmation, and the samples were sent to the Malbran Institute [reference laboratory]. While we await the [laboratory] results, the Municipality [health workers] went to the home of the patient as well as his workplace in order to determine whether there are conditions for the appearance of hantavirus [infections]," he indicated.

According to the statements his co-workers made to Infoplatense [media], the victim was bitten by a rodent in the retail supermarket. They are demanding urgent intervention by the store for rodent elimination in order to avoid new cases.

In February of this year [2014], NINI was closed after complaints of a customer who found a nest of rats on one of the shelves.

[It is of interest to know the species of rodents and the specific hantavirus involved in this situation. If they are native rodents, such as the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_), then Lechiguana hantavirus may be involved. If the rodents were brown or black rats (_Rattus norvegicus_ or _Rattus rattus_), then Seoul hantavirus may be responsible for this case. There have been 2 fatal cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Buenos Aires province this year (2014). The hantavirus involved in this case is not identified, and ProMED would be interested in knowing whether a specific virus is laboratory identified.

Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina over the past 3 years (2012, 2013, and 2014). As noted in ProMED-mail archive no. 20110430.1348, several endemic hantaviruses have been associated with human infection in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely in this case, but this case in Buenos Aires province may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.
