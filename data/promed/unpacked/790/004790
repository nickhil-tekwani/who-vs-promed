One wild boar caught in Hokuto city, Yamanashi prefecture [map at https://tinyurl.com/y2wobbne], [has been] found to be infected with classical swine fever (CSF). This is the 1st wild-boar case in Yamanashi prefecture since the start of the event in Japan last year [2018]. The prefecture has decided to strengthen its efforts to control the spread of CSF by preventing the invasion of wild boar into domestic pig farms.

Yamanashi prefecture revealed that the wild boar caught in Akeno-cho, Hokuto city, on 9 Oct 2019 was found to be infected with CSF virus. According to the prefecture, there are 3 pig farms within a radius of 10 km [6.2 mi] from where the wild boar was captured; no abnormalities have been observed in these holdings.

Since last year [2018] in Japan, CSF has infected 12 prefectures; in all 12, including Yamanashi, [the virus has] affected domestic pigs, and in 11 prefectures, [it has affected] wild boar (Gunma, Saitama, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Nagano, Gifu, Shizuoka, Aichi, Mie, and Shiga). Now CSF has also been found in wild boar in Yamanashi.

The prefecture has decided to strengthen its efforts to control the spread of the disease, in particular to prevent wild boar from entering pig farms, and to thoroughly disinfect them. In addition, according to the prefecture, as a result of discussions with the national government, Yamanashi prefecture has been added to the areas in which vaccination [of domestic pigs] is applied. This will be addressed in November [2019].
