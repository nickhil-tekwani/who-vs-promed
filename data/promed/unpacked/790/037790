Update on Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease - Singapore
---------------------------------------------------
An 11-month-old child, admitted to KK Women's and Children's Hospital in
critical condition 3 days ago, has been diagnosed this morning to be
infected with a virus that causes hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). A
statement from the government task force on the disease said on Saturday
that the child has been infected with Enterovirus 71. His twin brother, who
was also admitted with fever, has since recovered. The twin's older
sisters, aged 5 and 6, are well and the kindergarten they attend was found
to have no HFMD cases.
The total number of HFMD cases this week is 141, up from an average of 110
cases over the last 5 weeks. The task force, however, said there is no a
sign of an outbreak. It added that there were 1140 cases a week during the
peak of the outbreak last October [2000.
Parents are advised not to send their child who is unwell to school and to
consult a doctor if their child has a persistent fever for about 2 days, a
sore throat and runny nose, mouth ulcers and a rash on their hands, feet
and diaper areas.

[Although it was announced in the last post on HFMD in Singapore that no
further reports would be posted unless there was a drastic change in the
disease situation, it is worthy of note that once again Enterovirus 71 has
been isolated from a severely affected young child. Although in the past
several viruses have been associated with HFDV, it is becoming increasingly
likely that in Singapore Enterovirus 71 is responsible for cases of severe
illness in the very young. - Mod.CP
