Padang, West Sumatera: 4 year old bird flu suspect
--------------------------------------------------
A 4 year old girl from Lubuk Basung, Kabupaten Agam, West Sumatera has been
treated for suspected bird flu (avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection)
at the Central Public Hospital (RSUP) M Djamil in Padang, West Sumatera
[Sumatra].

"The patient is a 4 year old child. She was transferred to the M Djamil
hospital on Tuesday [20 Apr 2010] and now is being treated in the avian
influenza isolation unit," said the medical treatment director of the M
Djamil hospital, Dr Ira Yanti. The patient is still under observation due
to high fever and shortness of breath.

According to patient's parent, his daughter developed fever 3 days earlier,
and then was brought to the public health center. Her temperature fell
after taking medicine, but then returned the next day. Later she was rushed
to the regional hospital in Lubuk Basung. The hospital then referred the
patient to M Djamil hospital in Padang.

The patient was reported to have contact history with a dead chicken close
to her house. The dead chicken has tested positive for avian influenza A
(H5N1) virus infection by a rapid test.

A blood sample from the patient has been sent to the Research and
Development Laboratory of Ministry of Health, and the result is expected
within a week.

M Djamil hospital has treated 2 patients with suspected bird flu in a
period of 4 months. Since the appearance of avian influenza A (H5N1) in
West Sumatera, M Djamil hospital has treated a total of 80 patients with
suspected bird flu, 4 of whom have tested positive for H5N1, and one of
whom has died.

[Human cases of suspected avian influenza A (H1N1) virus infection are
reported frequently in the Indonesian press, but are rarely confirmed. In
the case of the M Djamil hospital in Padang over the years 4 of 80
suspected cases have been confirmed by subsequent laboratory testing.
Therefore the probability of the current suspected case being confirmed is
about 0.05, or possibly slightly greater as the patient is reported to have
had contact with a confirmed avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infected
chicken before her illness.
