Reuter, Catherine McCaw
Saying too little is known about it, the New Zealand Government will not
allow the importation and release of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV),
in spite of requests by farmers for it to do so. The farmers have argued
that RHDV offers a "once-in-a-lifetime chance" of beating the country's
rabbit problem.
MAF [?] deputy director-general Peter O'Hara was quoted as saying there was
"significant uncertainty" over the effectiveness of the virus in killing
rabbits, its impact on Australian rabbit populations varied, and that it
is not even known exactly how the disease is spread. "I recognize that my
decision will disappoint and even anger many people who are struggling to
deal with rabbits using current technology," O'Hara said. The Minister of
Agriculture was one of those disappointed. "Farmers in some areas are
facing very high costs for rabbit control and I fully understand their
frustration at the decision. I have instructed MAF to carry out an urgent
investigation of how the virus is spread. I want our scientists working
with Australian authorities to get answers to the questions raised by the
report as soon as possible," he said. The article reports that
environmentalists who had vigorously opposed introduction of the virus,
welcomed the decision and that they had argued that it could spread to
native fauna, even though extensive ministry testing concluded this would
not happen.
It is estimated that 20,000,000 rabbits have died within three months of the
release of RHDV (called "rabbit calicivirus disease" = RCD in Australia).
The article concluded by reporting that New Zealand's last experiment with
biological control, the introduction of stoats and ferrets last century to
control rabbits, had been a disaster for indigenous wildlife and that,
ironically, if RHDV had been introduced and rabbit numbers reduced, stoats
and ferrets which prey on rabbits would switch to native birds, lizards and
insects.
