Three people have died of a mysterious haemorrhagic fever in South Sudan's Raja county of Western Bahr-el-Ghazal state, raising fears of an outbreak of Ebola. On Thursday [8 Oct 2020] evening, South Sudan's Ministry of Health said it is investigating the death of 3 people who had presented suspected symptoms of bleeding and fever and indicated that some 127 similar cases had been recorded since last week.

"On 3 Oct [2020], a woman in Sir Malaga town died shortly after returning home from the market with symptoms of bleeding from nose and mouth. On the following day, 2 family members of the deceased presented similar symptoms and died as well," a dispatch from the ministry said. The government said the deaths triggered an alarm, which prompted the army base in Sir Malaga to report to Raja.

"At 1 pm on 5 Oct [2020], additional information was received from the same area indicating that 3 neighbours of the victims presented similar symptoms. One is critical, and 2 are mildly ill," the statement said.

In response, the health ministry said it sent a team of 6 healthcare workers that included epidemiologists from the World Health Organisation, surveillance officers, clinicians, laboratory officers, and hygiene officers to investigate the cases. The team collected blood samples from 2 acutely sick patients. The samples are now undergoing testing at the Public Health Laboratory.

"The rapid response team has listed a total of 8 contacts and has also conducted a risk assessment, risk communication, and mobilisation in the area. The suspected cases have no history of contact with the patients who have similar clinical manifestations," said the ministry. The government called on WHO and other partners to address basic health services, stressing that the area has no road network or health facility, lacks basic health services, and has no telecommunication coverage. Sir Malaga town is located close to the Central African Republic.

According to a report released by Global Health Workforce Alliance, South Sudan faces a severe shortage of all categories of trained health professionals, including physicians and midwives. The country relies on inadequately trained or low-skilled health workers.

In May this year [2020], doctors working as part of the rapid response team threatened to lay down their tools if their incentives were not paid. The healthcare workers highlighted the dangers posed by the surge in the number of coronavirus infections in the country and demanded the taskforce provides them with working incentives. They also demanded accommodation to keep them away from their families to curb the spread of the pandemic to their family members.

[Viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) is a generic term for a group of illnesses caused by a number of families of viruses including Nairoviridae, Filoviridae, Arenaviridae, Hantaviridae, Phenuiviridae, and Flaviviridae. Some of these viruses -- such as dengue, yellow fever, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever -- are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. Some, such as Lassa fever, are spread by rodents, while others, such as Ebola and Marburg viruses, are spread by other vertebrates such as bats. When the disease is severe, the virus can damage blood vessels, causing bleeding in organs, under the skin, and from the mouth, eyes, and ears.

These viruses share a number of features:
- They are all RNA viruses and are all covered, or enveloped, in a fatty (lipid) coating.
- Their survival is dependent on an animal or insect host, called the natural reservoir.
- The viruses are geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live.
- Humans are not the natural reservoir for any of these viruses. Humans are infected when they come into contact with infected hosts. However, with some viruses, after the accidental transmission from the host, humans can transmit the virus to one another.
- Human cases or outbreaks of hemorrhagic fevers caused by these viruses occur sporadically and irregularly. The occurrence of outbreaks cannot be easily predicted.
- With a few noteworthy exceptions, there is no cure or established drug treatment for VHFs. (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

Viruses that must be considered in the diagnostics are Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, dengue, yellow fever, and others; some bacterial infections must be considered as well. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever was determined to be an important, but not exclusive, cause of outbreaks in the Sudan in a study published in 2019:

"The Federal Republic of Sudan has had at least 12 outbreaks of febrile illness of unknown cause associated with symptoms of haemorrhage and high case-fatality rates since 2012. Outbreaks without clear diagnosis are concerning, particularly in countries such as Sudan where a range of high-consequence diseases, including viral haemorrhagic fevers, are endemic or epidemic, and local laboratory capacity is limited. We transferred historical samples stored in the National Public Health Authority from one of these outbreaks that occurred in Darfur 2015-2016 to the Public Health England Laboratory at Porton, UK, and tested them against a wide range of infectious diseases to try to identify the cause, and to help the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health to develop and target their limited laboratory capacity. We found that Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever was an important cause but not the only source of cases in this outbreak. This has implications for prevention and control as well as for treating cases. Our study also highlighted the need for future studies to explore other possible causes, including new pathogens, and reinforced the need to boost surveillance, lab, and investigative capacity for more timely and complete outbreak response."

Any information on this outbreak, which already has apparently caused more than 100 cases, would be appreciated. - Mod.LK
