Mystery Amazon illness kills 8 Peruvian Indians
-----------------------------------------------
8 indigenous Peruvians have died from a mysterious disease in the
country's remote northern jungle, and around 100 people are suffering
from fever and respiratory problems, doctors said on Thursday [29 Dec
2005].
The Aguaruna Indians in Peru's Amazon jungle began showing symptoms
of the illness, which include vomiting blood, at the start of
December 2005. The illness could have been transmitted by animals.
"It seems like Yellow Fever, but it isn't," said Luiz Suarez,
director of epidemics at Peru's health ministry.
Some Aguarunas have been evacuated from the Alto Tuntus community by
helicopter to the nearest major town of Bagua. "We've got 109 people
with these symptoms, and everyone is receiving treatment ... but 5
people are in a very serious situation in hospital," said Martin
Glendenes, head of the hospital in Bagua.
Glendenes said he had sent samples of the disease to the Peruvian
capital, Lima, for analysis and that the illness was killing about 8
in every 10 people it had infected so far.
Peru's jungle communities have been susceptible to rare diseases in
recent years and have few antibodies because of the remoteness of
their villages. Health ministry doctors also lack funds to build
proper hospitals and vaccinate communities.

[Running the above given symptoms through the Gideon program (Global
infectious disease and epidemiology network
<http://www.gideononline.com/promed>,
the following differential diagnosis and probability of occurrence is
provided: Yellow fever (68.4 percent), _Streptococcus suis_ infection
(27.5 percent), Leptospirosis (2 percent), Hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome (1.1 percent), Septicemia - bacterial less than one
percent), Plague (less than one percent), Toxic shock syndrome (less
than one percent), Typhoid and enteric fever (less than one percent),
Malaria (less than one percent), Rocky Mountain spotted fever (less
than one percent , Fungal infection - invasive (less than one
percent, Dengue (less than one percent), Melioidosis (less than one
percent).
According to the above article, the most likely cause, yellow fever
has been ruled out. No mention is given of bacteriological testing to
address the next most probable cause (according to GIDEON); readers
are reminded of the outbreak of hemorrhagic illness in China this
past year associated with _Streptococcus suis_. With respect to
another more common etiology, leptospirosis, Gideon has the following
background information: "A study conducted in 2001 revealed that 0.7
percent of the population of Pampas San Juan are seropositive, 16.5
percent in rural communities (San Carlos, Moralillo and Buen Pastor)
and 28 percent in Belen. (See ref. 1).
29 percent of wild mammals in the region of Iquitos are infected with
_Leptospira_ species (1.5 percent with _Leptospira interrogans_) - 19
percent of rodents, 39 percent of marsupials and 35 percent of
chiropters (1997 to 1998). (See ref. 2).
Notable outbreaks: 1999 - An outbreak (72 cases) was reported among
military recruits in the Amazon (Junin Department). (See ref. 3).
In addition, the Amazon basin is a region where there have been foci
of arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers (Bolivia and Venezuela), coinfection
of hepatitis B virus and Delta virus resulting in a fulminant
hepatitis, and probably a number of other as yet unidentified viruses
that may be associated with hemorrhagic manifestations. We await
further information from knowledgeable sources when available.
