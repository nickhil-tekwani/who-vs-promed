A case of Murray Valley encephalitis has been diagnosed in a young male
from Western Australia who is now recovering in hospital. Evidence of
infection has also been detected in sentinel chickens in Wyndham in the
north east of the State. Only one or two out of every 1,000 persons
infected with the virus develop serious disease. Symptoms include fever,
headache, nausea, vomiting and convulsions. No specific treatment is
available. Local residents and visitors have been reminded to avoid
mosquito bites by wearing loose fitting clothing, using insect repellant,
and ensuring that fly screens on houses and caravans are in working order.

[Murray Valley encephalitis virus infections in western Australia are
unusual but not rare. This flavivirus, as well as Kunjin virus, are
autochthonous in Australia. Now that Japanese encephalitis virus has been
recognized in Australia [see Japanese encephalitis - Australia
980402070830], serodiagnosis of flavivirus infections will become even more
difficult there because of the close antigenic relatedness of these
viruses. - Mod.CHC]
