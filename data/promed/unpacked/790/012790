Russia: 28 people have been infected with hemorrhagic fever in Stavropol
--------------------------------------------------
In Stavropol the diagnosis of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has
increased since April 2005 -- so far in 2005, 28 people have been diagnosed
with this disease according to information from Rospotrebnadzor (Russian
Department of Consumer Needs Surveillance). At present, 19 people are
getting treatment in hospital, 6 of whom have been laboratory-confirmed
with CCHF.
6500 citizens of Stavropol have sought medical care after tick bites due to
concern about infection with hemorrhagic fever. In comparison, during 2004,
4500 applied sought medical care.
According to Rospotrebnadzor, tick activity is very high this year, and
more than 10 million dollars have been allocated for the purposes of
prevention and treatment of hemorrhagic fever. About 4.9 million rubles
[USD 170 000] have been allocated to disinfest rest areas and summer camps
with anti-tick solutions. This money was also used to prepare hospitals to
admit patients with hemorrhagic fever and spread information among the
population. For people that are infected with hemorrhagic fever, 4.5
million rubles [USD 156 000] have been allocated for treatment, which is on
average 300 rubles [USD 10] for each patient.

[Crimean hemorrhagic fever is endemic in this part of Russia. The City of
Stavropol (1989 pop. 318 000), is the capital of Stavropol Territory in
southern European Russia, on the Stavropol Plateau. It has machine-tool,
wool, leather, grain milling, and food-processing industries. There are
natural-gas fields in the area. Founded in 1777 as a Russian fortress, it
was an important base for the subsequent Russian conquest of the Caucasus.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) outbreaks have been reported in
this area of Russia at least 15 times (including this episode) by ProMED
since 1999 (see references in post 20050501.1214 referenced below). In the
Stavropol area, the CCHF seasonal epidemic seems to peak around April and
May each year. I wonder if the health department does routine field
surveillance to check on the infection rate of the local ixodid ticks. The
CCHF virus circulates between ticks and small vertebrates in the wild, and
eventually a mature infected tick feeds on humans (with a fatality rate of
approximately 30 percent). From many CCHF postings in the past, I have not
seen any information in line with this concern. For control and prevention
of dengue fever, one of the sentinel efforts planned by the public health
authority is to monitor the rate of infected mosquitoes from the beginning
of the rainy season, which usually coincides with the dengue-prevalent
period. Any further information from experts in CCHF and entomology is
welcomed. - Mod.RY]
