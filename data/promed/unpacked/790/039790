Aside from the obvious error in the news quote (the fox was killed BEFORE
testing for rabies - as the testing is done from brain tissue), ProMED-mail
readers should be aware that NC has had a major public health success in
averting human cases during this massive epizootic that is in its fifth
year and climbing. Despite the thousands of transmissions of rabies virus
between wild and domestic animals in all possible combinations, a strong
public and professional education effort has increased awareness, increased
dog and cat vaccination compliance and protection levels, and assisted with
high rates of post-exposure prophylaxis in exposures that are determined to
be risky.
Sensational reports like this one, including another ProMED-mail article
earlier re beavers attacking boaters and swimmers in Jordan Lake, are to be
expected. The effective daily competence of our county health departments,
our wildlife personnel, our licensed veterinarians and physicians goes
unsung by a jaded press, but is rewarded in this epidemiologist's eyes by
the absence of _Homo sapiens_ from the long list of affected species.

[The error was mine as I had tried to make clear that the animal was killed
before examination but in minimising editorial changes I did not improve
the situation. My apologies. However we at ProMED-mail cannot disseminate
the successes of the North Carolina Public Health Department, nor any
other, if they do not provide us with the statistics and reports on their
hard work. It reminds me of the young man winking at a girl in a darkened
room ... no one can see what he is doing however comely he is. I doubt if
Music would want us to censure all rabies reports, because they are
"sensational". If nothing else they are timely reminders of the ongoing
risk of this disease. If you want your successes broadcast, give us your
material. Don't expect us to find it by accident. - Mod.MHJ
