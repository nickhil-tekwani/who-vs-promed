On Thursday [6 Feb 2014], at a meeting of the State Special Commission's working group on foot and mouth disease [FMD], it was reported that 10 more cattle have showed symptoms of FMD in the Maikhantyn Bor Hill area in Tuvshinshiree soum [district] of Sukhbaatar Province.

The meeting attendees said that the disease is showing a tendency for further spread of infection as one more soum has been added to the list of infected ones after Ongon, Naran, Dariganga and Bayandelger soums in the same province.

The working group agreed to work closely on protecting the bordering soums of Khentii and Dornogovi to prevent the spread of the disease.
The group also found that there are over 100 antelope and other livestock without owners with FMD infection symptoms along the infected soums' borders.

As of Thursday [6 Feb 2014], officials have eliminated 143 cattle out of 34 400 livestock belonging to 64 households in the 5 focus areas.

To contain the disease, 34 100 livestock were injected with FMD [vaccine]. However, the vaccination has covered only 16 percent of all livestock requiring vaccination.

Using all available vaccines, livestock in only 7 soums can be injected nationwide. Full vaccination will require that the state either directly purchase the FMD vaccines or announce a tender bid to select a business to provide them.

The State Budget includes 2.4 billion MNT [USD 1 386 872] for purchasing 6 million dosages of vaccines in 2014, and the state announced it would hold a tender starting from 20 Feb 2014. However, any vaccines delivered from Russia to Mongolia will [only] be available after 60 to 90 days. Mongolia has negotiated with Hong Kong suppliers to import 300 000 dosages of the vaccine, but unfortunately, the soonest the 1st shipment of vaccines could arrive in Mongolia would be 10 Apr 2014.

Veterinarians are now monitoring a total of 180 000 livestock. Currently, 376 officials are working in the infected area with 68 vehicles. Officials have agreed that sterilization and neutralization substances and tools are required. Actions being taken against the spread of FMD are being financed by province budgets. An additional 940.2 million MNT [USD 543 307] is required.

[The time gap between the detection of FMD in susceptible livestock and the availability of a potent vaccine based upon homologous or close-related strains for the mass vaccination required is critical. Such emergency situations, including the administrative, financial and bureaucratic difficulties which have to be overcome, are known to anyone involved in confronting transboundary viral animal diseases, particularly the highly infectious, rapidly spreading FMD. In countries which do not apply stamping out, the said interim period is extremely demanding: intensive surveillance and severe quarantine measures are required; cooperation of stakeholders is essential in tandem with effective policing powers.

The FMD virus strain circulating in Mongolia is similar to the one circulating since early 2013 in China, namely FMDV serotype A, topotype ASIA, Genotype/strain Sea-97. This strain has spread to Russia and Kazakhstan. It entered west Mongolia, close to China's border, in July 2013. The genotyping results of 3 samples submitted to the World reference laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD) in October 2013 showed its homology with the Chinese and Russian strains. The closest reference strain (potential vaccine strain) was shown to be 'A/TAI/7/2003 (HQ116312)'. See the genotyping report of batch "WRLFMD/2013/00020" at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2013/WRLFMD-2013-00020%20A%20Mongolia%202013.pdf. - Mod.AS
