KEM records first case of drug-resistant vivax malaria
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUMBAI [Bombay:
The city's KEM Hospital has recently recorded the
first known case of a patient of vivax malaria who is
resistant to
all the drugs currently recommended under India's Malaria
Control Programme. The patient lives in Thane and has not
travelled to any area outside the city where he might have
picked
up this drug-resistant parasite.
Nilima Kshirsagar, head of KEM Hospital's
clinical pharmacology department [says:
"We are very surprised by this case. It highlights the need
for
surveillance systems, early diagnosis and prompt treatment to
prevent transmission of the parasite in the population. We
are not
left with too many drugs we can use. We are seeing cases
where,
despite compliance of treatment, relapse occurs,'' she says.
Vivax malaria is widespread across India. Resorting to a
second
line of treatment would cripple the poor and prove expensive
to
India's health programme. In Tetar village of Betul district,
for
instance, a survey records that a population of 300 Gond
tribals
has spent almost Rs 1,29,500 on treatment costs in 1998.
