UNICEF says 23 893 cases of measles have been recorded in Yobe between January and June, this year [2017]. Samuel Sesay, the UNICEF Consultant in the state, made this known on [Fri 3 Nov 2017] at a workshop for Measles Vaccination Campaign in Damaturu [local government area, LGA, Yobe].

He attributed the high figure to security challenges and poor attitude of parents to present their wards for vaccination. Sesay said: "We have observed non-compliance by parents and lack of trust in the vaccination exercise by parents and guardians." According to him, the new exercise will be conducted in 2 phases starting with 8 local government areas of Bade, Bursari, Damaturu, Karasuwa, Machina, Nangere, Potiskum, and Yunusari.

He said: "The 2nd phase will cover Fika, Fune, Geidam, Gujba, Gulani, Jakusko, Nguru, and Tarmuwa LGAs."

Sesay said that the exercise would be conducted in designated health centres, palaces of traditional rulers, and schools.

He said that the Yobe Primary Health Care Management Board would partner the military to extend the coverage to remote areas.

The consultant called for partnership with the media to educate the populace and eradicate misinformation about measles vaccination to ensure the success of the exercise.

[According to the WHO (http://www.who.int/features/2017/measles-vaccination-nigeria/en/), "high insecurity, difficult terrain, and lack of functioning health facilities add to the enormous logistical challenges of organizing a large mass vaccination campaign in Nigeria that requires assembling and training more than 4000 vaccination teams and ensuring the vaccine is kept within cold chain conditions (2 to 8 deg C [35.6-46.4 deg F]) in a climate where average daytime temperatures are above 30 C.

The vaccination teams for the campaign [in 2017] are made up of 7 people including a supervisor, vaccinators (health workers), record keepers, community mobilizers, and town criers. The teams also give children deworming medication and vitamin A supplements [to counter malnutrition] at the same time as the measles vaccination."

Many cases of measles have [been] reported in several parts of Katcha area of Khanpur tehsil of Shikarpur district.

This was revealed in a meeting held at Deputy Commissioner [DC] Office Shikarpur; it was held under the umbrella of DC Shikarpur, Syed Hassan Raza.

The deputy commissioner [DC] Shikarpur rebuked over the performance of health officials and issued strict direction to administer measles vaccination to affected children and said that there are 62 health facility centres where 110 vaccinators have been posted, but in spite of that vaccinators have failed to administer measles vaccination to children due to which measles cases have been increasing, DC said.

On the occasion, he directed to in-charges of PPHI [Primary Healthcare Initiative Sindh], Indus Hospital to keep vigilant eye over the performance of vaccinators and monitor their attendance and a copy of master roll should be submitted in this office on monthly basis so that their attendance could be checked.

The deputy commissioner also expressed his concerns [about polio control and directed] in-charge Shikarpur to write the letters to Local Government and Education department's authorities that district Shikarpur employees were not serious to play their role in anti-polio drive.

Dr Shabbir Shaikh while giving briefing told the meeting participants that we have administered polio drops to [241 617] children with the help of 570 mobile teams despite 3852 children remaining because they are not available, besides the performance of 17 union councils are not satisfactory, Dr Shabbir added.

Measles in Pakistan: Time to make steps towards eradication Travel Med Infect Dis 2017; 18: 67-9; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tmaid.2017.08.002 regarding the low rate of coverage for measles in Pakistan. Challenges to vaccination programs in the country exist due to its large population and the remote geographical location of many areas.

Abstract
--------
World Health Organization (WHO) measles surveillance data report a reduction in cases of measles globally from 67 524 cases in 2015 -- 16 846 in 2016, and a reduction in deaths from 546 800 to 114 900 during period of 2000-14. Pakistan is among the 5 nations where almost a million children did not receive their 1st dose of measles vaccination, and outbreaks of the disease resulted in 4386 cases in 2011, 14 687 cases in 2012 with 310 deaths. In 2013, about 25 401 cases of measles were reported and 321 affected children died. The measles vaccination coverage is very low in Pakistan for both 1st dose and booster dose. To prevent outbreaks of measles in Pakistan a national vaccination program should be launched side by side with a polio eradication program in each district and township and a campaign should be launched to educate parents on measles vaccination for children to reduce the measles case fatality rate.

Measles outbreak DREF [Disaster Relief Emergency Fund] Operation MDRTJ025 Final Report
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Situation analysis
Description of the disaster
The measles epidemic in Tajikistan started in April 2017 in Rudaki district, and gradually spread to the capital city of Dushanbe and the surrounding districts, as well as Khatlon oblast. In mid-April 2017, 263 registered cases of measles were reported, out of which 157 were laboratory confirmed. By 1 May 2017, the number of notified and investigated cases rose from 263 to 345, with 246 patients (71 per cent) hospitalised. There were 2 child deaths registered over the course of the epidemic -- one in Khatlon oblast and one in the Districts of Republican Subordination).

The group most affected by the epidemic were children between 1 and 9 years of age. This also corresponded to the cohort born after the last national measles and rubella (MR) immunisation campaign conducted in 2009. Normally, the immunisation centre of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSP) carries out immunisation on an annual basis for approx. 97 per cent of this cohort. The remaining 3 per cent -- including migrants, Roma and displaced people -- however, tends to remain non-immunised.

In response to the outbreak, the MoHSP decided to conduct a nationwide MR vaccination campaign targeting children aged 1-9 years, 15-26 May 2017, with the support of the Measles and Rubella Outbreak Response Initiative (MRI) Fund. The government of Tajikistan issued a decree on National Additional Immunisation Days in the country on 28 Apr 2017. The MoHSP issued an internal order on immunisation accordingly.

In the 1st 10 months, 45 cases of measles -- including 1 death -- have been recorded in Hanoi, against the northern region's 99 cases and the country's total figure of 229 cases.

Even though this amount remains within acceptable range, in the past 2 months, infections rose by 4 to 5 a week throughout the city and rural districts.

Healthcare authorities warn of a possible outbreak if preventive efforts are neglected, said director of the Hanoi Preventive Medicine Centre, Nguyen Nhat Cam.

Cam also said that the northern region had started to experience the 1st cold spells of winter, an ideal condition for measles. He said that of those infected, only 30 per cent had been vaccinated.

To potential outbreak of measles in the winter-spring season, the municipal health department has notified all public and private agencies and companies in the health sector to boost measles check-up and treatment efforts.

Accordingly, agencies need to retrain their staff with the latest guidelines for diagnosis and treatment to offer help to those in need. They have also been told to stock up on measles medicine, medical equipment, and to prepare rooms and quarantine areas.

Starting this month [November 2017], the Hanoi Preventive Medicine Centre will coordinate with all of the city's districts to immunise all children under 5 years old who have not been given the shots.

The health department will conduct environmental sanitation and community-based treatment in areas where measles cases are discovered.

Measles is caused by a virus and there is currently no effective medicine for it, so death is always a possibility. While the disease itself is not serious, its complications are -- including pneumonia, encephalitis, malnutrition, and diarrhoea.

"When a child starts showing symptoms of measles, self-treatment is absolutely ill-advised, the family must take the child to professional health centre for diagnosis and treatment," said Nguyen Van Lam, director of the National Paediatrics Hospital's Infection Ward.

Even though the rate of immunised children in the capital city is high, about 95-97 per cent, each year, 150 000 children need to be vaccinated. Even if the rate of unvaccinated children stays at 4 per cent, that creates 6-7000 unvaccinated children a year. According to latest report, in the last 5 years, the number of children that have not been vaccinated against measles in the city has reached 32 634.

The last outbreak of measles in the city occurred in 2014 with 1700 cases. It claimed the lives of 14 children. Due to a boost in immunisation, the number of measles cases in the city fell to 39 in 2015 and 3 last year [2016].

According to the health ministry, in Viet Nam, about 3 per cent of children have not been immunised against measles.

[It is remarkable that only 39 and 3 cases of measles were reported in Hanoi in 2015 and 2016, respectively, after an outbreak in 2014. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the vaccine. It is commendable that 97 per cent of the children have been vaccinated.

The Institute of Public Health of Serbia on [Wed 8 Nov 2017] reported an epidemic of measles in the city of Belgrade. This came after tests confirmed the presence of the virus in 5 patients.

The Institute explained on [Thu 9 Nov 2017] that this does not mean an epidemic has been declared.

The Institute stated on [Wed 8 Nov 2017] that none of these patients have been in contact with persons from the territory of Kosovo and Metohija, nor with persons exhibiting a similar clinical picture in the territory of their residence.

The patients have either not been vaccinated against this contagious disease, or are of unknown vaccination status. One patient has pneumonia -- a serious complication of measles.

There have been 65 cases of measles in the territory of Serbia since early October [2017]: in Serb enclaves in Kosovo, as well as in Bujanovac, Kraljevo, and Belgrade.

Measles is a disease slated for eradication, and in such circumstances, even a single case is considered an epidemic.
