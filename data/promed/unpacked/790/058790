Pandemic cut US life span almost 2 years, more than any peer nation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Life expectancy in the United States declined 1.87 years from 2019 to after the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, more than any of 21 other high-income countries -- with greater losses in Hispanic and Black populations, according to a modeling study published today [13 Apr 2022] in JAMA Network Open. [Steven H. Woolf, Ryan K. Masters, Laudan Y. Aron. Changes in Life Expectancy Between 2019 and 2020 in the US and 21 Peer Countries. JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(4):e227067. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.7067]

Researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University estimated life expectancy in the United States and 21 peer countries using a simulation of life tables based on national death and population data in 2019 and 2020. Life expectancy reflects how long a group of people can expect to live were they to experience at each age the age-specific mortality rates of that year, the study authors noted.

Peer countries were Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, England and Wales combined, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Northern Ireland, Norway, Portugal, Scotland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and Taiwan.

Hispanic, Black people, men hit hardest
---------------------------------------
Over the study period, Americans' overall life expectancy fell, on average, 1.87 years, with greater decreases in Hispanic (-3.70 years) and Black (-3.22) compared with White (-1.38) populations. Overall life expectancy fell from 78.86 to 76.99 years, with a greater decline among males (-2.13 years) than females (-1.51 years). Life expectancy among Black populations dropped from 74.76 to 71.54 years, while it dipped from 81.86 to 78.16 years in Hispanic populations.

The largest decreases in life expectancy were among Hispanic (-4.31 years) and Black (-3.54) men, compared with -1.53 years in White men.

In contrast, life expectancy declined by an average of 0.58 years in all peer countries, with no country seeing such large declines as those in the United States. In 2020, average life expectancy in these countries was 81.50 years, 4.51 years more than in the United States (76.99 years). Losses in life expectancy ranged from -1.43 years in Spain to increases in New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan. No changes were seen in Denmark, Finland, and Norway.

Countries with the largest losses in life expectancy among females were Spain (-1.34 years), England and Wales (-1.07), and Belgium (-1.06). Among males, the greatest declines were in Spain (-1.44 years), England and Wales (-1.38), and Italy (-1.31).

Inequities 'will persist without corrective action'
---------------------------------------------------
Starting in the 1980s, US life expectancy started rising slower than in other high-income countries, leveling off after 2010, the study authors noted.

"The downward trends in US life expectancy since 2010 reflect increasing death rates among young and middle-aged adults, including higher cause-specific death rates from drug overdoses, cardiometabolic diseases (eg, obesity and diabetes), and other chronic diseases," they wrote.

Relative to peer countries, the researchers said, the United States has poorer social and economic conditions (e.g., education, poverty, income inequality, affordable housing), health-promoting environments and infrastructure (walkability, public transit, access to healthy food), social well-being (e.g., racial segregation, social isolation), and access to healthcare and health insurance.

"In contrast to policies adopted by its peers, US social welfare spending is less equitable and less beneficial to children and families," the authors wrote. "The US also lacks universal health care and provides weaker protections for public health and safety."

In addition to entering the pandemic in a relatively weak state, the United States also was affected by the mismanagement of federal, state, and local pandemic responses, public resistance to public health measures to prevent viral transmission, and high numbers of excess deaths due to healthcare disruptions, the researchers said.

"The large and highly racialized decreases in US life expectancy underscore the growing US health disadvantage relative to peer countries and the need for policies that prioritize health and equity," they wrote. "The decrease in US life expectancy was experienced disproportionately by Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black populations, consistent with a larger history of racial and ethnic health inequities resulting from policies of exclusion and systemic racism."

The researchers called for the creation of policies to address the systemic causes of the discrepancy in life expectancy between the United States and peer countries, as well as persistent racial health inequities.

"Until final death counts for 2021 are released, it remains unclear if the large decreases in US life expectancy documented here extended into 2021," the authors wrote. "However, even with a return to prepandemic mortality rates, the US health disadvantage that has grown over decades will persist without corrective action."

"US residents will continue to die at higher rates than their counterparts in other advanced democracies, and their health will remain sharply divided along racial and ethnic lines, until the country makes policy choices that optimize health, well-being, and equity," they added.

[2] Global case count
[A] Global COVID cases fall as CDC extends travel mask order

Global COVID-19 cases have declined for the 3rd week in a row, with deaths easing off to levels seen early in the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in its latest assessments of the pandemic.

At a briefing today [13 Apr 2022], however, WHO officials urged countries not to drop their guard, as a few locations report spikes and some -- like the United States - -see early signs of new rises.

Citing concerns about a case uptick, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) today extended the mask order for public transit by 2 weeks.

In its latest weekly update on the pandemic, the WHO said cases dropped 24% last week from the week before, with all regions reporting declining cases. [https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---12-april-2022]

Of about 7 million cases reported last week, the 5 countries logging the most included South Korea, Germany, France, Vietnam, and Italy. Deaths were down 18%, with the most reported from the United States.

Of virus samples sequenced over the past 30 days, 99.2% were the omicron variant. Among omicron subvariants, the WHO said it is monitoring BA.4 and BA.5, which have mutations that might contribute to immune escape. It said both have S-gene dropout, which helps distinguish them from the more dominant BA.2 and is useful for tracking the spread. The 2 subvariants have been detected in a few countries, and more work is under way to assess them.

At today's WHO briefing [13 Apr 2022], Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said some countries are still seeing serious spikes in cases, which are putting pressure on hospitals. And he warned that the capacity to track COVID-19 trends is compromised as countries reduce testing for the virus. [https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-who-press-conference-13-April-2022]

In a related development, the WHO's COVID-19 emergency committee met for the 11th time earlier this week to review the latest developments and to fine-tune its temporary recommendations.

Emergency committees typically meet every 3 months or more often, as needed. The group's last meeting was in the middle of January [2022].

At today's briefing [13 Apr 2022], the WHO said the emergency committee concluded that the COVID-19 situation still warrants a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), with the experts adding one new recommendation and modifying its earlier advice. In the new recommendation, the group urged countries to strengthen their national response to COVID-19 by updated preparedness and response plans based on various ways the pandemic might play out as spelled out in the WHO's most recent response plan.

Regarding the emergency committee's assessments, Tedros said one of the take-home messages is that countries should not let their guard down and now is the moment to work even harder to save lives. He added that the emphasis should be on equitable access, not just to vaccines, but also to treatments and testing.

"Diagnosing at-risk patients early enough for new antivirals to be effective is essential and should be available to everyone, everywhere," Tedros said.

In other global developments:
• As cases in China rise, especially in Shanghai, President Xi Jinping today [13 Apr 2022] said the country must press on with its strict COVID-19 control and prevention measures, according to Reuters. [https://www.reuters.com/world/china/no-relaxation-covid-measures-china-says-president-xi-2022-04-13/]. Lockdowns and other measures have led to supply chain problems and have been a drag on China's and the world's economies. China today [13 Apr 2022] reported 27 920 new cases, 26 420 of them asymptomatic. Shanghai accounted for 79% of the symptomatic cases and 95% of the asymptomatic cases. [http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2022-04/13/c_85918.htm]
• Italy's National Health Institute today [13 Apr 2022] estimated that COVID-19 vaccination cut the country's death toll in half. A study conducted from January 2021 through January 2022 suggested that vaccination prevented 150 000 deaths and 8 million illnesses over that span. Researchers also said vaccination prevented 500 000 hospitalizations and more than 55 000 intensive care unit admissions.

CDC extends travel mask order
-----------------------------
Today [13 Apr 2022] the CDC said masks will remain required on airplanes and trains for 2 additional weeks, as the nation faces a slight uptick in cases caused by the BA.2 subvariant. The CDC Nowcast estimates that BA.2 now accounts for 85.9% of new US COVID-19 cases. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions]

The federal mask mandate for planes and trains was set to expire on [18 Apr 2022], but it has been extended until [3 May 2022].

In a media statement, the CDC said, "The CDC Mask Order remains in effect while CDC assesses the potential impact of the rise of cases on severe disease, including hospitalizations and deaths, and healthcare system capacity. TSA [Transportation Security Administration] will extend the security directive and emergency amendment for 15 days." [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0413-mask-order.html]

Also today [13 Apr 2022], the CDC announced it was revamping its Travel Health Notice system for international destinations beginning on [18 Apr 202].

Now, only countries with "rapidly escalating case trajectory or extremely high case counts, emergence of a new variant of concern, or healthcare infrastructure collapse," will be issued a level 4 for COVID-19.

"With this new configuration, travelers will have a more actionable alert for when they should not travel to a certain destination (Level 4), regardless of vaccination status, until we have a clearer understanding of the COVID-19 situation at that destination," the CDC said.

The United States reported 27 853 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [12 Apr 2022] and 561 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]

The 7-day average of new daily cases is 31 276, with 516 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic_gfx/]

Casirivimab-imdevimab may cut COVID hospitalizations, ICU stays, death
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Two new studies describe benefits of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment casirivimab-imdevimab in adult COVID-19 outpatients, both suggesting lower rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death in an era dominated by the delta variant.

University of Pittsburgh researchers led the 1st study, published yesterday [12 Apr 2022] in JAMA Network Open. It compared 28-day hospitalization and death rates in 1959 high-risk COVID-19 outpatients given a single dose of casirivimab-imdevimab either subcutaneously or intravenously (IV) or no treatment from [14 Jul 14-26 Oct 2021].

Among patients given subcutaneous casirivimab-imdevimab, the rate of hospitalization or death was 3.4%, compared with 7.0% in those receiving no treatment (risk ratio, 0.48). A 2nd analysis of 2185 outpatients found a 2.8% rate of hospitalization or death after subcutaneous treatment, versus 1.7% after IV treatment (adjusted risk difference, 1.5%).

Among all patients receiving an IV dose, rates of ICU admission and the need for mechanical ventilation were similar (adjusted risk difference, 0.7% and 0.2%, respectively). "These results provide preliminary evidence of potential expanded use of subcutaneous mAb treatment, particularly in areas that are facing treatment capacity and/or staffing shortages," the study authors wrote.

[Citation: Erin K. McCreary, J. Ryan Bariola, Richard J. Wadas, et al. Association of subcutaneous or intravenous administration of casirivimab and imdevimab monoclonal antibodies with clinical outcomes in adults with COVID-19. JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(4):e226920. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.6920]

In the 2nd study, a team led by University of Arizona researchers studied outcomes in 4213 adult COVID-19 patients given casirivimab-imdevimab and 4213 matched, untreated control patients from [1 Aug to 30 Oct 2021]. Prevalence of the delta variant in Arizona at that time was 95%-100%. The results were published yesterday [12 Apr 2022] in Open Forum Infectious Diseases.

Compared with controls, those who received the mAb treatment had significantly lower rates of 30-day all-cause hospitalization (4.2% vs 17.6%, respectively), ICU admission (0.3% vs 2.8%), and death (0.2% vs 2.0%). Casirivimab-imdevimab treatment led to a 78% lower rate of hospitalization (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22) and an 89% lower death rate (HR, 0.11).

"Irrespective of COVID-19 vaccination status, receiving monoclonal antibodies led to significantly reduced hospitalization rates, ICU stays, and all-cause mortality, which is essential in treating breakthrough infections," the researchers concluded. "Such findings have implications for unvaccinated individuals and immunocompromised individuals who will have attenuated immune responses to vaccines and may benefit from passive immunity."

Canadian study shows high COVID-19 attack rate in households
------------------------------------------------------------
An antibody surveillance study based on Ottawa households published yesterday [12 Apr 2022] in CMAJ Open shows that almost half of household members were infected from an initial case of COVID-19 in the home from September 2020-March 2021, before delta became the dominant strain.

The study included 695 participants from 180 households in Ottawa when the original strain of COVID-19 was dominant and vaccines were not yet widely available. Enrollment required a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. Of the 180 index participants, 74 were children and 106 were adults, and, of the 515 household contacts, 266 were children and 249 were adults.

A total of 487 household contacts (94.6%) (246 children, 241 adults) had SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing, of whom 239 had a positive result (secondary attack rate 49.1%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 42.9% to 55.3%), the authors said. Approximately 37% of those cases were asymptomatic, and children were as likely as adults to be asymptomatic.

Adult index patients were more than twice as likely than children to transmit to household members (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.6). In households in which the index participant was an adult, 167 of 293 members (57.0%; 95% CI, 49.5% to 64.2%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, compared with households in which the index participant was a child, which saw 72 of 194 members (37.1%; 95% CI, 27.7% to 47.6%) develop SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

"Household exposure to an infected person is associated with a 10-fold higher risk of infection compared to exposure outside the home," the authors wrote. "The role of children in transmission warrants attention, since they are often asymptomatic or have mild symptoms."

"Interpretation: The rate of SARS-CoV-2 transmission within households was nearly 50% during the study period, and children were an important source of spread. The findings suggest that children are an important driver of the COVID-19 pandemic; this should inform public health policy.

Household transmission is an important contributor to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection (1-5). Household exposure to an infected person is associated with a 10-fold higher risk of infection compared to exposure outside the home (6).

... The role of children in transmission warrants attention, since they are often asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (16,22-28). Addressing this gap in the literature would allow a more evidence-based approach to public health initiatives, given that COVID-19 pandemic control strategies have often affected the lives of children and youth (e.g., school closures, suspension of recreational activities), as well as negatively affecting their overall well-being (29,30).

Analysis of household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is central to the development of health policies that protect vulnerable people while minimizing the impact on children (29-31). ..."

Because of the role of children in transmission, it is important to vaccinate them to help control infection in schools and homes. See publication for references and full text. - Mod.LK]
