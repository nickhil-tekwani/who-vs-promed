13 suspected of having anthrax in north
---------------------------------------
A total of 13 people in Meo Vac district in the northern mountainous
province of Ha Giang are suspected of having caught anthrax after eating
meat of sick cattle, said the director of the Ha Giang Department of
Health. The health official, Hoang Ngoc Quyen, said tests conducted by the
Central Institute for Hygiene and Epidemiology on 13 food poisoning cases
in Meo Vac district, Ha Giang province showed some samples were positive
for the anthrax bacillus. However, doctors haven't confirmed whether these
people (2 have died) are infected with anthrax or not. Of those, 11 showed
symptoms of anthrax after eating sick cattle meat but they have recovered
already.

In late June 2008, some cattle died of an unknown disease, thought to be
anthrax. Some people who ate meat [from the sick cattle] also got sick with
symptoms of anthrax. The Preventive Health Agency has asked the Ha Giang
Department of Health to take urgent measures to prevent the disease and
warn locals not to eat meat of sick animals.

The Central Institute for Hygiene and Epidemiology is conducting further
tests to confirm whether the disease is anthrax or not.

[In the initial account there were 2 dead and 3 hospitalised in association
with eating this contaminated meat. Some 420 had been exposed and there was
a concomitant press hysteria. If we apply a 4 per cent attack rate as for
Kyrgyzstan --- an epidemiologic stretch I freely admit --- we get a number
very similar to the 13 reported cases for northern Viet Nam. It is probably
just by chance as there is no reliable information on the numbers of
livestock outbreaks much less butchered infected cattle being fed into the
local communities. It will be interesting to see what does and does not
emerge in the coming weeks. - Mod.MHJ]
