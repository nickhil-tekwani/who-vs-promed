Suspected Weak Bird Influenza Shows up in S.Korea: Ministry
--------------------------------
A suspected case of the milder bird flu virus has been found at a duck farm
in Gwangju, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said Wednesday
The H5N2 strain of avian influenza is less virulent than the H5N1 strain
that swept through South Korea and Southeast Asia in 2003.
The ministry said that it has destroyed and buried the ducks in the farm in
question and have set up tougher quarantine inspections in Gwangju.
The strain is said to pose no health threat to humans.
"The H5N2-strain has never spread to humans and must be differentiated from
the deadly bird flu that spread through Asia last year," a official said.

Nation Alert Over Animal Epidemics
Quarantine Strengthened to Prevent Recurrence of Bird Flu
------------------------
Quarantine authorities have stepped up measures to prevent the outbreak of
epidemics of influenza both for humans and animals in South Korea during
the winter season.
A bird flu case was reported in Chunchon, Kangwon Province, raising
concerns over a possible recurrence of avian influenza, although the case
originated from a low-pathogenic virus.
The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said Thursday that a total of 20
000 chickens had died of the disease in the city. It has begun quarantine
activities at chicken and duck farmsteads in and around the city.
The ministry has strengthened its vigilance over the epidemic, while also
conducting tests on the secretions of migratory birds in their habitats here.
In the same vein, preventive activities at ports and airports for imports
of livestock products and for travelers from countries with reports of the
virus have been intensified.
The government has also distributed studies on the epidemiological origin
of a high-pathogenic virus of the epidemic to farmsteads and provincial
quarantine authorities.
After acknowledging the need for an international network for global
epidemics, South Korea hosted the 2004 International Conference on Zoonoses
last week, which was the first of its kind in Asia.

Suspected bird flu case found in S.Korea
-----------------
A suspected case of the milder bird influenza virus has been found at a
duck farm in Gwangju, some 330 kilometers south to Seoul, South Korean
Yonhap News Agency quoted an official of the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry as reporting on Wednesday.
The quarantine authorities found the H5N2 strain of avian influenza on 1
Dec 2004 when they inspected the farm in the South Korean city, according
to Kim Chang-seob, the director of the ministry's animal health division.
This marked the first time for the H5N2 virus, known to be less virulent
than the H5N1 strain that swept through South Korea and other Asian
countries and areas in late 2003 and early 2004, to appear in South Korea.
"We have a strict standard operating procedure for such developments and
have ordered all 9000 ducks at the farm to be destroyed even if the H5N2 is
verified as a 'weaker' strain," said Kim Chang-seob.
He said the H5N2 strain has never spread to humans and must be
differentiated from the H5N1 Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) that
hit the poultry raising industry of Asia last year.
He added that preliminary tests on eggs from the farm have indicated that
the H5N2 has not mutated into a virulent variety. Kim said the final
conclusive DNA test will be released Thursday and the results will be
informed to its trading partners.
The chief veterinary officer said that a quarantine area has been set up
around the infected farm to prevent possible spread and inspectors are
checking nearby duck farms for possible contamination.
The South Korean government has conducted tough inspections of all duck and
chicken farms since 1 Nov 2004 and will continue to do so until the end of
February [2005]. This period is deemed as dangerous because migratory birds
arrive in the country and spread disease in the period.
South Korea reported 19 cases of the HPAI from December 2003 to March 2004,
but no South Korean people has been founded infected with such influenza up
to now.
The local poultry raising industry and related chicken meat industry has
suffered some 1 trillion won (946.9 million US dollars) loss because of the
influenza.

[Due to technical difficulties we are unable to provide a veterinary health
moderator comment on these reports at this time. We apologize for this
inconvenience. That being said, this moderator would like to request more
information on this suspected outbreak of H5N2 in South Korea. According
to the newswires, final testing results of pathogenicity (high vs. low)
should be available on Thurs (23 Dec 2004).
Mod. AS' comment in Avian influenza, A/H5N2 - Taiwan: suspected
20040116.0169 seems appropriate to repeat here: "From this news item it is
not clear whether this incident, and the identification of an A/H5N2 avian
influenza virus, may be regarded as a case of HPAI (highly pathogenic avian
influenza); the clinical findings are not described. However, one should
take into consideration that an HPAI A/H5N2 virus, which caused a serious
outbreak in northern Italy in 1997/1998, was found -- in phylogenetic
analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) genes -- to cluster with the A/H5N1,
HPAI Hong Kong strains which had infected humans. (See: Isabella Donatelli,
et al. Characterization of H5N2 influenza viruses from Italian poultry. J
Gen Virol 2001; 82: 623ï¿½30. <http://vir.sgmjournals.org/>). During 1994/5,
an A/H5N2 virus was involved in a serious avian influenza outbreak in
Mexico (see references). Complementary information, and official
confirmation from the [South Korean] authorities, are needed." - Mods.MPP/DK]
