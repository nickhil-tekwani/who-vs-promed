China: 1st Human Rabies Death in Beijing in 11 Years
-----------------------------------------------
A male resident in Beijing died of hydrophobia [rabies] this week [2nd week
August 2005], the 1st death caused by hydrophobia in this capital city
since 1994, the Municipal Health Bureau announced on Fri 12 Aug 2005. The
man, 45 years of age, was a native of neighboring Hebei Province. He had
been living in Beijing before his death. He died of the fatal disease at
the Ditan Hospital after being bitten by a pet dog, according to the Bureau.
The Bureau urged local citizens to keep a close eye on their pet dogs and
have them regularly vaccinated against rabies.

[Dogs account for 99 percent of human cases worldwide, and for 95 percent
of post-exposure vaccinations. From 1984 to 1989, the annual reported
numbers of cases of rabies in China were between 4000 and 6000, but
decreased after 1990. In 1996, the reported cases decreased to the lowest
level, from 3520 in 1990 to 159. However, the number of reported cases has
been continuously increasing since 1998, reaching 1122 in 2002, a 7.06-fold
increase as compared to the number in 1996. The epidemic areas were mainly
located in the southeastern and southwestern parts of the country, such as
Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Anhui, Fujian, etc. The rabies-free
status of Beijing in recent years can probably be attributed to the
compulsory vaccination of pet dogs, which seems to be rigidly enforced in
urban areas (see ProMED-mail post: Rabies, human - China (nationwide) (02)
20031125.2920). In contrast, there is no requirement for dogs raised and
sold for meat to be vaccinated. The majority of dogs which have been killed
as a result of rabies outbreaks have been in dog meat production areas,
where there are few if any pet dogs. - Mod.CP]
