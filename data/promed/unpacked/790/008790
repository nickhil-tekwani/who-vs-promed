S. Korea confirms first bird flu outbreak in 8 months
-----------------------------------------------------
South Korea's 1st bird flu outbreak in 8 months
forced the slaughter of thousands of ducks in the
country's south Saturday [24 Nov 2007], although
the deadly H5N1 virus was not involved, the government said.

The virus that caused the latest outbreak was a
"low pathogenic" H7 strain that has not been
known to spread to humans, said an official at
the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.

Quarantine workers slaughtered about 17 000 ducks
[see commentary] at the farm in Gwangju, about
330 km (205 miles) southwest of the capital,
Seoul, the official said on condition of
anonymity, citing office policy. The outbreak,
South Korea's first since March, was confirmed on
Friday [23 Nov 2007], the ministry official said.

A total of 7 outbreaks of the lethal H5N1 virus
hit poultry farms across South Korea between
November 2006 and March this year [2007],
resulting in the slaughter of about 2.8 million birds.

The country declared itself free of bird flu in
June [2007] after reporting no new outbreaks for
3 months. The latest outbreak does not affect
South Korea's bird flu-free status because it
involves a "low pathogenic" virus, the ministry official said.

Since H5N1 re-emerged in 2003, it has led to the
death or slaughter of hundreds of millions of
birds and has killed 206 people worldwide,
according to the World Health Organization.

[According to a Reuters newswire, the outbreak
involved 13 000 fowl, of which 3800 were ducks.
The accurate information is expected to be
included in the anticipated official notification
of South Korea. Such notification is prescribed
by OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, since
all H5 and H7 viruses have been classified as
notifiable avian influenza (NAI) viruses,
independently of their pathogenicity rate. This,
due to the risk of a low virulent H5 or H7
becoming virulent by mutation in poultry hosts.
In addition, any highly pathogenic avian
influenza isolate is classified as an NAI virus.
Although all virulent strains isolated to date
have been either of the H5 or H7 subtype, most H5
or H7 isolates have been of low virulence.

According to chapter 2.7.12 of OIE's Manual of
Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial
Animals, the methods used for the determination
of strain virulence for birds have evolved over
recent years with a greater understanding of the
molecular basis of pathogenicity, but still
primarily involve the inoculation of a minimum of
8 susceptible 4Â­8-week-old chickens with
infectious virus; strains are considered to be
highly pathogenic if they cause more than 75
percent mortality within 10 days or have an
intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI) of greater
than 1.2. All virulent AI isolates are identified
as highly pathogenic notifiable avian influenza
(HPNAI) viruses. Regardless of their virulence
for chickens, H5 or H7 viruses with an HA0
cleavage site amino acid sequence similar to any
of those that have been observed in virulent
viruses are considered HPNAI viruses. H5 and H7
isolates that are not pathogenic for chickens and
do not have an HA0 cleavage site amino acid
sequence similar to any of those that have been
observed in HPNAI viruses are identified as low
pathogenicity notifiable avian influenza (LPNAI)
viruses and non-H5 or non-H7 AI isolates that are
not highly pathogenic for chickens are identified
as low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI). For
the above and additional information, see
<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00037.htm>.

An official notification on the outbreak,
including laboratory report with results of the
pathogenicity studies applied, is anticipated.- Mod.AS]
