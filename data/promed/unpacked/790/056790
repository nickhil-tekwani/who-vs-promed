Tumbu fly larvae infestations, identified by the Entomology
Department of ARC-Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute north of
Pretoria, Gauteng Province, have increased over the past 2 weeks.
Where we have previously received only one or 2 samples for
identification in a 5-year period, already 3 samples have already
been received in the last 2 weeks. As we are not primarily dealing
with human infestations, we may not be aware of the majority of these
cases. However, this outbreak seems not restricted to the North West
Province but may be much more widespread. Tumbu fly infestations,
especially in dogs, are not unusual in the northern parts of Pretoria.

[We are pleased to have this new information from a laboratory that
has identified the Tumbu fly as causing myiasis in the NW Province of
South Africa. It would be interesting to know what percentage of
infections being recorded are from non-humans such as dogs. - Mod.MS]
