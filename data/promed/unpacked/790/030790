On Wednesday morning [4 May 2011], the various services of the
country [New Caledonia] and the State [Polynesia] reviewed the
measures being taken to prevent the spread of chikungunya virus in
Polynesia.

For the time being, an epidemic has not been declared in New
Caledonia, but the appearance of a case out of Noumea [port town in
New Caledonia] suggests that the virus is spreading. Although no cases
have been confirmed [elsewhere] in French Polynesia, the country is
implementing health monitoring including flights between Noumea and
[the Island of] Tahiti and brochures produced by the Health Department
will be distributed to passengers coming from Noumea (Calin Air flight
arrival scheduled for Thu at 16.30 hrs), as the time had been too
short for the operation to be carried out throughout New Caledonia.
These brochures will describe the symptoms to travellers to alert them
[to the disease]: a sudden onset of fever higher than 38.5 deg C
[101.3 deg F], associated with headache and significant muscle pain,
and pain in the joints especially at the extremities. Posters will
also be arranged at strategic points at Faa'a airport.

Finally, spraying of insecticide will be undertaken aboard Air
Caledonia planes departing from Noumea. A note has been sent to health
professionals warning them to be on the lookout for patients
presenting symptoms of chikungunya (more or less similar to those of
dengue)

17 cases of chikungunya have been reported since March [2011] in the
area around Noumea. The appearance of new cases has concerned the New
Caledonian authorities, who have strengthened the fight against
mosquitoes.

[Although a chikungunya epidemic has not been declared on New
Caledonia, the number of cases reported has increased from 12 on 15
Apr 2011 to 17 in the report above. One hopes that the mosquito
control program will focus aggressively on sites of mosquito
reproduction in water catchments in and around buildings and less on
control of adults.
