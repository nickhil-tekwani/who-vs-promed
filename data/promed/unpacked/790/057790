The number of cases of hantavirus [infections] has risen to 14, since the Ministry of Health confirmed 3 new cases of fever and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. Carlos Muñoz, regional coordinator of epidemiology in Los Santos, stated that the 3 latest cases registered are a girl whose illness is yet to be confirmed as hantavirus fever, a 44 year old woman resident of Via Hacia Santo Domingo with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome admitted yesterday [Thu 24 Aug 2017], and a 23 year old young man with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome.

Muñoz indicated that the young man is from El Cocal but for the past 6 months has resided in El Cacao in Tonosi, and yesterday [Thu 24 Aug 2017] was taken from the Tonosi Rural Hospital to the Joaquín Pablo Franco Hospital in Las Tablas.

[The number of cases of hantavirus infections in Los Santos province continues to climb this year (2017). There is no indication of which hantavirus is involved in these 3 cases or in previous cases in Panama. As noted in comments on previous posts, Los Santos and adjoining provinces are endemic for Choclo hantavirus. Although no data on this or the previous cases in earlier years include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible, Choclo is the only one of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes HPS (hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome) or hantavirus fever. No vaccine is available for Choclo virus.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
