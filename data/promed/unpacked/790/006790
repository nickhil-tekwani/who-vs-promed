More Maine Horses Succumb to Triple-E
-------------------------------------
Two more Maine horses have died of the deadly mosquito-borne virus
known as Triple E [Eastern equine encephalitis, or EEE]. State health
officials say a horse in Gorham and another in Unity have died of the
illness. That's in addition to 3 other horses, 2 in Waldo County and
one in Penobscot County, who died of the illness late last month
[August 2009]. In addition, 3 other horses in Waldo and York Counties
are suspected of being infected with the virus.

"These 5 dead horses with EEE indicate that there is a risk of people
contracting the infection from mosquito bites," Maine Center for
Disease Control Director Dr. Dora Anne Mills says in a statement.
"Although the risk of contracting the infection from one mosquito bite
is very low, it now appears the risk is geographically fairly
widespread, given that it has now been detected in these various
locations this year. We can assume other areas of the state have
infected mosquitoes as well. Until we experience several deep frosts,
it is important people take precautions to avoid getting bitten by
mosquitoes."

While people can't contract the illness directly from horses, they can
be sickened by the bite of an infected mosquito. Mills says people
should cover up with long clothes, use an effective insect repellent
such as DEET and keep babies under nets outdoors.

The illness often causes little or no symptoms in people, but when it
does, it's fatal about one-third of the time, Mills says. In addition,
about half of those who get sick and survive are left with permanent
neurological damage.

Last year, a man who spent a lot of time in Cumberland county died of
the infection, but Mills says the man traveled extensively.

State Health Officials Say Triple E Spreading Across State
----------------------------------------------------------
For years it was perceived largely as a southern New England virus
contracted by horses that were bitten by infected mosquitos. But now
Eastern Equine Encephalitis, better known as Triple E, has leapt
across the New Hampshire border area where it was identified a few
years ago and is moving into the northern regions of Maine.

Dr. Don Hoenig, the state's veterinarian, says he's never seen an
outbreak like this. "Right now we have 4 other horses pending, 3
horses that have died, one in York County, one in Cumberland County
and another one in [the town of] Unity, and a sick horse in Unity
right now that we're waiting to hear on today," Honig said today at an
Augusta news conference.

For horse owners, the truly frightening reality of this virus is that
there is no effective treatment for the illness, which can peak within
24 hours of the animal's 1st symptoms. Hoenig says vaccinations are
the only means of preventing the spread of the virus and he's urging
all horse owners to protect their animals.

"Once they get it, they either die or they're euthanized -- it
approaches 100 percent. There's really no treatment other than
supportive treatment. And I'm astonished at how quickly this disease
progresses from a horse being normal to being comatose. I went and
looked at a horse on Friday afternoon [28 Aug 2009] that we euthanized
out in Unity, and that horse was normal on Thursday morning and by 3
o'clock on Friday afternoon it was pretty much flat out and comatose,"
he says.

"The concern we have, particularly now that schools are reconvening is
that people are aware that they should take precautions over the next
few weeks to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes," says Dr. Dora Anne
Mills, Director of the Maine Center for Disease Control.

Mills says there's only been one recorded case of a human death from
Triple E in Maine and that occurred last year in [the town of] Naples.
But Mills says the 73-year-old man had been traveling in other states,
making it difficult to determine whether he actually contracted the
virus here.

Because the virus has been discovered in Waldo County and Penobscot
County, Mills says Mainers need to be on their guard. "Although the
risk from any one mosquito bite giving you Triple E is very low, it is
not an infection you want to take a risk at getting," she warns. "It's
an infection where about a 3rd of those people with symptoms die; it's
a disease where about half the people who survive it have long-term
neurological permanent damage; and there's no vaccine for people, and
there's no effective treatment for people."

Mills says the virus poses a particular threat to those over 50 or
under 15 years of age. She urged Mainers to wear clothing that covers
their extremeties when spending time outside, and using insect
repellants that contain DEET.

Another Horse in Maine Dies of Triple-E
---------------------------------------
The most recent equine victim was from Penobscot County, while the
other 2 infected horses lived in Waldo County.

A 3rd horse in Maine has died from the virus known as triple-E. Maine
Center for Disease Control Director Dr. Dora Mills says the horse
lived in Stetson, located in Penobscot County.

In addition to the 3 known cases, State Health Director Dr. Dora Mills
says there are 4 other suspected cases of EEE in Maine horses. 3 of
those animals have died and one is critically ill. Those horses are
located in York, Cumberland and Waldo counties.

In addition, 2 other horses, both in Waldo County, were euthanized
earlier this month [August 2009] after contracting the virus. The
disease is fatal in horses, and there is no cure.

While people can't contract the virus directly from horses, they can
get sickened by a bite from an infected mosquito. Many people who
become infected show no symptoms, Mills says, but among those who do,
the illness is fatal in about one-third of cases, and about half of
symptomatic victims who survive are left with mild to severe permanent
neurological damage.

Mills says people should protect themselves from mosquito bites by
using an effective insect repellent such as DEET, covering up with
long-sleeve shirts, pants and socks when outdoors and placing mosquito
netting over infant carriers.

She says horses can be vaccinated against the disease. None of the 3
horses that have died had been vaccinated, she says.

[The eastern seaboard of the US has had an abundance of rain this
year. This has left puddles in unusual places that are perfect
breeding locations for mosquitoes.

It is sad, indeed, that the investment in a horse is lost because of
this disease, when there are vaccines to prevent the disease. The
immunity incurred from the vaccine is short-lived and it is advisable
to vaccinate 2 or 3 times a year.

Yes, while people may acquire the disease from the mosquito, there are
measures to protect yourself. Some of those measures were found in the
article above. It may also be wise to avoid being outside without
repellent in the dawn and the dusk of the evening. - Mod.TG]
