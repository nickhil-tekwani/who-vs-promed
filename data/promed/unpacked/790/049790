The Florida Department of Health on Tuesday, 7 Oct [2014], announced Florida's 1st confirmed case of an enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infection in a 10-year-old girl who is recovering in Polk County. This is an update to the Dept. of Health's previous announcement which incorrectly said that the 10-year-old patient is recovering in Hillsborough County. A spokesperson for Tampa General Hospital [TGH] said the patient was transferred from another hospital to TGH about a month ago [September 2014]. The patient was treated at TGH for 6 days and then released. No other details about the patient have been released.

"I don't think there's any reason to be panicked. I think if people use good hand washing, don't rub your eyes, sneeze into your elbows, I think that we can prevent infection," said Dr. Shirley Jankelevich of All Children's Hospital in St. Petersburg. She suspects patients in Florida had mild cases of enterovirus before the 10-year-old, they just weren't reported. "Most of the kids do OK. In fact, the majority of the kids do fine," she said. The strain can start like the common cold or flu with wheezing, high fever, and dehydration. Treatment varies depending on symptoms but includes fluids, rest, and in some cases, oxygen.

The Florida Department of Health advises parents, childcare workers and healthcare professionals to be vigilant for respiratory virus infections such as enterovirus (EV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza (flu). Enterovirus D68 can cause difficulty breathing in infants and young children. Like RSV and the flu, EV-D68 is highly contagious and could spread through droplets in coughs or sneezes or when someone touches a contaminated surface like a countertop or doorknob. Frequent hand washing and non-alcohol surface disinfectants are recommended since alcohol-based hand sanitizers and disinfectants have not been found to be effective against EV-D68.

The 1st case of the EV-D68 strain of enterovirus has been diagnosed on Prince Edward Island [P.E.I.]. Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Heather Morrison announced Tuesday [7 Oct 2014] the patient is a child under the age of 10, who was treated in hospital and has since fully recovered. The EV-D68 virus usually causes mild respiratory infections and cold-like illnesses. It can be spread through coughing and sneezing or by close contact with infected persons. Dr. Morrison said she was not surprised to see a diagnosis on the Island since enteroviruses circulate every year with cases across Canada.

The P.E.I. department of health and wellness said most people who become ill with EV-D68 will recover at home, but anyone experiencing difficulty breathing or shortness of breath should see a doctor. Only hospitalized cases in P.E.I. with respiratory illness are being tested for EV-068.

Enterovirus D68 count reaches 628 cases in 44 states
----------------------------------------------------
Another 34 patients have tested positive for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), raising the US total to 628 cases, and Florida has recorded its 1st confirmed case, according to today's [7 Oct 2014] update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Cases have now been confirmed in 44 states, the CDC reported. The only states with no confirmed cases are Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Tennessee, Alaska, and Hawaii. Florida's 1st case involves a 10-year-old girl in [Polk County] who is recovering, according to an Associated Press (AP) report today [7 Oct 2014].

EV-D68, previously uncommon in the United States, typically causes only cold-like symptoms, but in some children it can cause a severe illness that leaves them struggling to breathe. Almost all the illnesses have been in children, many of whom have asthma or a history of wheezing. The virus is believed to spread via coughs, sneezes, and contact with contaminated surfaces. The CDC says that 4 patients who died were infected with the virus, but the role it played in their deaths is unclear and still under investigation. Yesterday [6 Oct 2014], however, health officials in New Jersey said the virus caused the death of a 4-year-old boy who died in his sleep [without predisposing symptoms].

EV-D68 is also suspected of being a factor in a mysterious polio-like illness that has struck a number of children in several states, including at least 10 in Colorado. Four of the Colorado children, who had partial paralysis and limb weakness, tested positive for the virus. Keith Van Haren, MD, who has researched the polio-like cases in California, said he thinks EV-D68 will be identified as a factor in the cases, according to a Bloomberg News story today [7 Oct 2014]. "As a member of the clinical community, I think it is just a matter of time before we establish a definitive link between EV-D68 and this polio-like illness that follows," he said.

[Overall only a few cases diagnosed with enterovirus D68 virus infection have experienced severe disease, and most had some had some predisposition. Exceptional was the single case of enterovirus D68 virus infection diagnosed in New Jersey, where a 4-year-old child died in his sleep with no associated respiratory or other abnormalities.

As of Thu 9 Oct 2014, a previously identified enterovirus D68 patient has died, increasing the number of fatalities to 5. Tennessee and Oregon have now joined the list of affected states. The CDC has stated that there are 678 confirmed EV-D68 cases, up 50 from yesterday's 628. There have now been confirmed cases in 46 states, with Tennessee and Oregon as the newest ones. Only Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, and Arizona still have no confirmed infections, according to the CDC's list (http://www.cdc.gov/non-polio-enterovirus/outbreaks/EV-D68-outbreaks.html).

The role of enterovirus D68 in the 5 fatal outcomes remains unclear as there are few common features. The CDC has indicated that state and local officials have responsibility to determine the cause of death in such cases and to decide what information to release about them. Almost all the cases have been in children, many of whom have asthma or a history of wheezing. The virus, which was previously uncommon in the United States, typically causes only cold-like symptoms, but some children get seriously ill and have difficulty breathing. But it remains unclear whether enterovirus D68 virus plays any role in the mysterious polio-like illness that has struck a number of children in several states, including at least 10 in Colorado. Four of the Colorado children, who had partial paralysis and limb weakness, tested positive for enterovirus D68. - Mod.CP
