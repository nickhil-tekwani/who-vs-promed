*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Illegal movement of animals; Vectors

Epidemiological comments: As a part of surveillance carried out for Rift Valley fever [RVF] in the whole country under the Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] project No.OSRO.LIB 801.CHA, around 150 samples from sheep and goat farms were collected by risk-based surveillance teams in Alkufra. Two samples from the Aljouf area gave a positive result.

Control measures
Measures applied: Movement control inside the country; Traceability; Quarantine; Disinfection; Control of vectors; Vaccination prohibited; No treatment of affected animals.

Measures to be applied: Surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; Surveillance within containment and/or protection zone

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Central Veterinary Laboratory (National laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Sheep & or goats / IgG-capture ELISA / 13 Jan 2020 / Positive

Future Reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to the above report, 2 serum samples, one from a sheep out of 100 (how many sampled/tested?) in one flock, the other one from an animal out of 90 "sheep/goats" in another flock (how many sampled/tested?), both collected in the same municipality, which is located in the southern, arid part of the country, on 12 Dec 2019, were found positive by the IgG-capture ELISA test, applied on 13 Jan 2020. IgG levels rise after IgM and are detectable for life. To establish/evaluate the chronology of infection, combined use of IgM and IgG may have been helpful.

Notably, an earlier sero-survey in Libya, restricted to northern (Mediterranean) parts, which are, climatologically/ecologically more suitable for RVF circulation, did not discover positives. The authors concluded: "This study was conducted to investigate the epidemiological situation of RVFV in Libya. The viral circulation has not been detected in 11 provinces of the country as determined by absence of RVFV antibodies in animals tested during the sampling period. However, the evidence of RVFV activity in countries bordering the Southern part of Libya [Chad and Sudan] supports the hypothesis of a continuous risk of introduction of RVFV through animals imported from endemic neighbor countries." [1].

Sudan, a livestock exporting country, and Chad, are known to be RVF-infected. Another neighbor country of Libya, Egypt on its west, has been suffering RVF events since 1977.

OIE's terminology for the reporting of disease events may gain from some added flexibility. A single diseased animal is either a sheep or a goat, even in mixed small ruminant flocks (termed "sheep/goats," in OIE reports). The OIE term "sheep/goats" has, therefore, been changed in the above copied report to "sheep &/or goats."
