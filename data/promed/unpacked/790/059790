Cutaneous anthrax cases in Georgia increase, particularly near cities
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The incidence of human cutaneous anthrax (HCA) in the country of Georgia has increased recently even as the disease has reportedly declined worldwide, say findings of a study published this week in Emerging Infectious Diseases [see below].

The authors studied passive surveillance data on HCA cases reported to Georgia's National Center for Disease Control and Public Health from 2010 through 2012. A total of 251 HCA cases were reported during that time, as well as 74 cases in livestock, with the number of cases peaking in 2012. The risk for HCA was found to be higher during the study period than in 2007-2009.

HCA occurred predominantly in males (209 cases, or 84 per cent). The risk of HCA did not differ between patients who butchered/slaughtered cattle and those who processed/handled meat, although exposure through the former was more common in males and through the latter in females. People aged 50 to 64 years were at higher risk for infection which, according to the authors, could "reflect changing sociocultural practices related to an agrarian lifestyle."

HCA cases were concentrated in specific areas associated with agriculture but in close proximity to urban areas. Among possible factors at play in the urban concentration are reliance on these areas for commerce, increases in agricultural employment, and access to quick slaughter and sale of meat from sick and dying animals to mitigate economic losses.

Although the true cause of the increase in HCA cases is unknown, it is probably due to a combination of factors related to decreased public health funding and agricultural reform resulting in a shift from collectivization to private ownership. These factors, coupled with limited veterinary control and the cessation of compulsory livestock vaccination, have played plausible roles in the increased incidence of HCA. Livestock cases were out of sync temporally and spatially with human cases, indicating anthropocentric reporting or high incidence from relatively few animals, although differences in the aggregation of livestock cases limit the inference of spatial synchrony. Controlling HCA requires controlling the disease in livestock and highlights the need for a [coordinated] One Health approach. Our findings can be used to formulate public health interventions aimed at controlling anthrax in livestock and increasing awareness of the disease, particularly in urban areas. Given the limited resources available, future efforts should focus on high-risk areas for livestock surveillance and control, such as targeted vaccination campaigns.

[In virtually all of the one-time Soviet countries, human cases of anthrax are reported, but the reports of livestock outbreaks, which generated the human cases, are more notable by their absence, which probably reflects a persistent difference in political authority between the Public Health Service and the Animal Health/Veterinary Service. The most cost effective way of preventing any and all human cases of anthrax is to have a targeted livestock control and surveillance programme and proactively vaccinate herds in high-risk areas for the livestock disease. Thanks to niche modeling, these high-risk areas can be tightly defined, so we are not talking of a nation-wide vaccination. Depending on rural circumstances and direct and indirect propinquity to urban areas, the relationship of livestock cases to human cases varies, from 10:1 to 1:10 and in some places 1:more than 50. It is tempting to concentrate only on the latter situations, but any benefits are short-lived. It returns. An effective livestock anthrax control and surveillance programme not only controls the disease but also eradicates it for the same cost. - Mod.MHJ
