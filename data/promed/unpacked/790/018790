Horses in 3 locations in the Illawarra in New South Wales have been
confirmed with strangles infections, a respiratory disease which
causes swollen lymph nodes, coughing, nasal discharge and fever.

So far, the disease has been confirmed at Kembla Grange, Albion Park
and further north at Denham Court, but the NSW Department of
Agriculture says it is likely to have spread to other locations.

Suspect cases must be reported to Industry and Investment NSW to
protect export markets concerned about the presence of the disease,
but properties won't be put in quarantine.

[Strangles is an infectious, contagious disease of _Equidae_
characterized by abscesses in the lymphoid tissue of the upper
respiratory tract. The causative organism, _Streptococcus equi equi_,
is highly host-adapted and generally produces clinical disease only
in horses, donkeys, and mules. It is a gram-positive,
capsulated-hemolytic Lancefield group C streptococcus, which is an
obligate parasite and a primary pathogen.

_S. equi equi_ is highly contagious and produces high morbidity and
low mortality in susceptible populations. Transmission occurs via
fomites and direct contact with infectious exudates. Carrier animals
are important for maintenance of the bacteria between epizootics and
initiation of outbreaks on premises previously free of disease.
Survival of the organism in the environment is dependent on
temperature and humidity; it is susceptible to desiccation, extreme
heat, and exposure to sunlight, and must be protected within mucoid
secretions to survive. Under ideal environmental circumstances, the
organism can survive 7-9 weeks outside the host. Paddocks and barn
facilities used by infected horses should be regarded as contaminated
for about 2 months after resolution of an outbreak.

The incubation period of strangles is 3-14 days, and the 1st sign of
infection is a fever of 103-106 F [39.4-41.1 C]. Within 24-48 hours
of the initial fever spike, the horse will exhibit signs typical of
strangles, including mucoid to mucopurulent nasal discharge,
depression, and submandibular lymphadenopathy. Horses with
retropharyngeal lymph node involvement will have difficulty
swallowing, inspiratory respiratory noise (compression of the dorsal
pharyngeal wall), and extended head and neck. Older animals with
residual immunity may develop an atypical or catarrhal form of the
disease with mucoid nasal discharge, cough, and mild fever.
Metastatic strangles ("bastard strangles") is characterized by
abscesses in other lymph nodes of the body, particularly in the
abdomen and, less frequently, the thorax.

The environment for clinically ill horses should be warm, dry, and
dust-free. Warm compresses are applied to sites of lymphadenopathy to
facilitate maturation of abscesses. Facilitated drainage of mature
abscesses will speed recovery. Ruptured abscesses should be flushed
with dilute (3-5 percent) povidone-iodine solution for several days
until discharge ceases. NSAID [non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]
can be administered judiciously to reduce pain and fever and improve
appetite in horses with fulminant clinical disease.

Antimicrobial therapy is controversial. Most authors agree that
initiation of antibiotic therapy after abscess formation may provide
temporary clinical improvement in fever and depression but ultimately
prolongs the course of disease by delaying maturation of abscesses.
Antibiotic therapy is indicated in cases with dyspnea, dysphagia,
prolonged high fever, and severe lethargy/anorexia [loss of
appetite]. Administration of penicillin during the early stage of
infection (up to 24 hours after onset of fever) will usually abort
abscess formation. The disadvantage of early antimicrobial treatment
is failure to mount a protective immune response, rendering horses
highly susceptible to infection after cessation of therapy. If
antimicrobial therapy is indicated, procaine penicillin (22 000
IU/kg, intramuscular injection, twice a day) is the antibiotic of
choice.

The affected horses are quite uncomfortable. Sharing of halters and
brushes that may contact the fluid from draining abscesses can spread
the disease to other horses. Those affiliated with the government
veterinary office are quite conscious of biosecurity and are able to
assist the track veterinarian and the owners with proper methods to
avoid spreading the disease.
