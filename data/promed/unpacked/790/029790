The white spot virus that devastated Queensland prawn farms last year [2017], has been detected in the Brisbane area.

The positive results were reportedly found in crab and prawn samples from the northern Moreton Bay region near the Redcliffe Peninsula.

Minister for Agricultural Industry Development and Fisheries Mark Furner said the results for Logan and Brisbane rivers were still being processed but should be completed within 2 weeks.

"This is the same area that positive results were found in 2017," Mr Furner said.

"Biosecurity Queensland is processing the remaining samples collected from the Logan and Brisbane River area and will release the results once the testing has been completed.

"We have received results back from the southern Moreton Bay area and all samples collected were negative for white spot syndrome virus, so that area is clear."

Acting Chief Biosecurity Officer, Malcolm Letts, said Biosecurity Queensland was now waiting on results from the Brisbane and Logan River areas.

"It's important that we complete testing from all sites before we make any decisions about our white spot disease strategy moving forward," Mr Letts said.

"These initial results have been discussed with key seafood industry groups and we will continue to work closely with them throughout this process."

Movement restrictions will remain unchanged with uncooked prawns, yabbies, and marine worms not to be moved out of the movement restriction area, which runs from Caloundra to the New South Wales Border and west to Ipswich.

Biosecurity Queensland are also conducting surveillance for white spot disease along the east coast of Queensland with results expected in June [2018].

"It's really important to remember that white spot disease only affects crustaceans and has no impact on human health, so make sure you go out and support your local seafood industry by asking for Queensland seafood next time you go shopping," Mr Furner said.

[White spot viral disease has caused high mortalities and severe damage to the shrimp culture industry in China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and India. The virus was first detected in Taiwan in 1992, and then it spread to Japan and almost all Asian countries. The 1st diagnosed case of WSVD in the Americas occurred in 1995 in a South Texas shrimp farm, and it was suggested that the most probable route for its introduction was through an Asian imported frozen-bait shrimp commodity. In February 1999, the virus caused massive mortalities in some farms in Ecuador, and the most recent outbreak occurred in Brazil in 2016. Reports in Australia began in December 2016.

Acutely affected shrimp are reported to show a rapid reduction in food consumption, become lethargic, and have a loose cuticle with white spots (hence, the name "White spot" disease) of 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, which are more apparent on the inside surface of the carapace (see http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/t/k/v/a/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gtkvca.png/1483356145795.jpg). The white spots represent abnormal deposits of calcium salts by the cuticular epidermis.
