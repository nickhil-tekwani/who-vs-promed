Rare pneumonia found among USA soldiers in Iraq
-----------------------------------------------
A rare and sometimes deadly pneumonia has hit 18 USA soldiers deployed in
Iraq, and Army medical investigators are at a loss to explain the cause,
according to a study published on Tue, 21 Dec 2004.
In a report appearing in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
researchers from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center said 2 of the soldiers
had died from the rare illness, called acute eosinophilic pneumonia, or AEP.
No common source was found for the outbreak that occurred between Mar 2003
and Mar 2004 among the soldiers in Iraq. The study covered only that time
period and there was no indication whether cases have continued to show up
since then.
The 18 victims studied ranged in age from 19 to 47 and all used tobacco,
with 75 percent recently taking up the habit. All but one reported
"significant exposure to fine airborne sand or dust" while in Iraq.
While only 18 cases have been reported among 183 000 troops deployed in
Iraq during the time period involved, the authors said the cases are still
significant because the disease is very rare in the general population.
The illness was not immediately diagnosed in several victims, who suffered
fever and respiratory failure. Several had to be put on mechanical
ventilators to help them breathe and were administered corticosteroids.
Months later, a few reported continued breathing problems or wheezing.
"Inquiries to the Iraqi health officials did not suggest that AEP was
occurring in the local population or that there has been an unusual
increase in the incidence of pneumonia of any kind during the study
period," the report said.
The report's author, Dr. Andrew Shorr, warned the illness can strike
suddenly and mimic more common ailments such as acute respiratory distress
syndrome or community pneumonia.
The report follows another battle zone study in November 2004 that found an
unexpectedly high number of USA soldiers injured in the Middle East and
Afghanistan had tested positive for a rare, hard-to-treat blood infection.
Army doctors at that time said 102 soldiers were found to be infected with
the bacteria _Acinetobacter baumannii_. The infections occurred among
soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, Landstuhl
Regional Medical Center in Germany and 3 other sites between Jan 2002 and
Aug 2004.
85 of the bloodstream infections occurred among soldiers serving in the
Middle East and Afghanistan, the report said. Normally military hospitals
see only one such case every year, it added.

[The presumed antigenic stimulus related to AEP in the military cases is
unclear. Reports of both AEP and acinetobacter in Iraq have been posted in
the last 2 years on ProMED. - Mod.LL]
