Fears that 200 may be affected after wildlife visit
---------------------------------------------------
A popular wildlife park at the center of a health scare remained open to
the public yesterday [23 Apr 2005], as the number of adults and children
affected by a stomach bug continued to escalate, with fears that more than
200 people may have been infected.

6 children were admitted to the hospital earlier this week [4th week April
2005] after being infected by the cryptosporidium bug following a visit to
the Auchingarrich Wildlife Centre, near Comrie, in Perthshire.

2 days ago, NHS Tayside revealed that the health authority's outbreak
control team had been notified of 13 confirmed and 18 suspected cases of
infection by the contagious parasite, the symptoms of which include stomach
upsets, diarrhea and fever. But yesterday [23 Apr 2005], the number of
confirmed cases increased to 32, with 200 suspected cases also reported to
the health authority.

The children and adults are believed to have become infected with the bug
while petting and hand-feeding newborn lambs in a barn at the center. The
lambs have already been removed from the park as a precautionary measure. A
spokesman for NHS Tayside said yesterday [23 Apr 2005]: "There are now 32
confirmed cases, although we expect that number to continue to rise. A
further 200 people who visited Auchingarrich have reported becoming ill
with symptoms consistent with cryptosporidium infection. It is very
important to stress, however, that these are not confirmed cases, and
further investigations are ongoing, and it is unlikely that all will have
been infected. Laboratory tests are continuing, and we hope to give a
further update early next week." He added: "There is only one child still
in hospital, but no one is seriously ill." The spokesman said the center
would remain open. He explained: "The view of the incident control team is
that the center has voluntarily suspended animal petting, and the facility
where that happened has been closed. The bales of hay within it have been
burned, and it has been disinfected. Our view at the moment is that the
risk to the public has been removed, although we have to remind people
again and again to please wash their hands after they have been out in a
rural setting and have been in contact with animals or their environment.
It is absolutely vital to observe good hygiene."

Cryptosporidium is a parasite which is commonly found in animal intestines.
It can cause diarrhea, vomiting, stomach cramps and a slight fever. Members
of the outbreak control team from NHS Tayside and officials from Perth and
Kinross Council's environmental health service are continuing an
investigation into the outbreak. Scotland's largest cryptosporidium
outbreak of recent times was in Glasgow in 1998 when more than 300 people
were confirmed as having been affected by the stomach bug.

[ProMED-mail reported in October 2003 that more than 200 cases had been
reported from Scotland since March that year. As stressed in this message,
not all cases with gastrointestinal symptoms have been diagnosed with
cryptosporidium infection.

Cryptosporidium is typically an intestinal parasite of calves, not lambs,
and contact with animals may not be a particular risk factor, except when
the animal has diarrhea at the time of contact. Other infections may also
be possible, like Vero-toxin-producing _Escherichia coli_ (VTEC), for which
contact with animals is a well recognized risk factor. - Mod.EP]
