An operation to collect hundreds of dead Dalmatian pelicans killed by avian flu was under way in northern Greece on [Sat 19 Mar 2022], around the Prespa Lakes, as well as Lake Heimaditida, Kastoria, and Zazari. The operation to remove the dead birds, many of them in their nests, took place under stringent biosecurity measures to minimize further contamination.

Speaking to state-run news agency Amna, deputy mayor of Amynteos Eleni Gyriki, said that 80 dead birds had been collected by fishermen going out on their boats, and placed in special bags to minimize transmission of the virus in order to be incinerated.

An operation by a private company on Little Prespa Lake has collected so far 748 dead pelicans in the 4 days of operation. This is where the problem is most acute, as the reed beds in the lake house one of Europe's largest colonies of pelicans. The aim is to contain the [situation] before the second wave of migrating birds arrives at the lake in April [2022].

The first dead birds were located in mid-February [2022] and the phenomenon "exploded" quickly. In the first 2.5 weeks 574 dead pelicans and another 24 in Lake Heimaditida were recorded, the director of the Prespa Protection Company, Myrsini Malakou, told Amna [news agency] beginning of March [2022]. She said that a total of 70 dead pelicans were found last year [2021].

Authorities in Greece have been on alert this year [2022] due to the death of more than 6000 cranes in Israel, at the end of the year [2021], from bird flu. "In the measures we make every year in the colonies, using drones and telescopes, we saw the dead birds, in a number that has never been seen before," Malakou said.

Samples of dead animals, in collaboration with the Prespa National Park Management Agency and the municipality of Prespa, were sent to the Veterinary Service of the regional unit of Florina where it was confirmed that it is the H5N1 virus.

[2] UK (Scotland): wild birds

Cases of bird flu have been confirmed at a rescue centre in North Ayrshire as the disease continues to spread across the country. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 has been detected at Hessilhead Wildlife Rescue Centre, near Beith, with a 3km [about 1.8mi] protection zone and a 10km [about 6mi] surveillance zone now in place.

The security measures, which took effect from 7.30pm on [Fri 18 Mar 2022] mean movement restrictions within these zones -- for example, poultry, carcasses, eggs, used poultry litter and manure -- to prevent any further spread of disease.

Advice shared by the Scottish Government said: "Vigilance by bird keepers is important and any suspicion of disease should be reported immediately to the local Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) office." The Scottish Government's chief vet, Sheila Voas, urged bird owners to take extra steps to protect their animals.

Several cases have also been confirmed in Aberdeenshire, as well as in Angus and Dumfriesshire. A Great Britain-wide prevention zone has been in place since November [2021] and includes the requirement to house birds within the protection zones to prevent the spread of the disease.

Highly pathogenic avian influenza is said to present suddenly, often with very high mortality, with affected birds developing swollen heads, blue colouration of the comb and wattles, dullness, lack of appetite, respiratory distress, diarrhoea and a significant drop in egg production. However, there can be considerable variation in the clinical picture and severity of the disease.

If you are suspicious your flock has any form of avian influenza you must contact your local animal health office immediately.

[Since October 2020, Europe has experienced the most severe avian influenza epidemic to date. Wild birds appear to be playing an important role in its spread and maintenance. Most wild birds reported infected have been Anseriformes (swan, ducks, geese), followed by birds of prey. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. - Mod.PMB
