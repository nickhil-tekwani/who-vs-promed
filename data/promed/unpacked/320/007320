Two people have died, while 3 others are in hospital after consuming the meat from animals suspected to have been infected with anthrax at Widnaba, in the Bawku West District of the Upper East Region.

District Director of Health, Benjamin Aggrey, told the Ghana News Agency after a brief sensitization programme organized by the District Health Administration (DHA) in the community that the 2 ate meat from dead cattle that had fallen ill. However, on 1 Mar 2016, when the animals fell sick again, some people ate the meat and afterwards showed symptoms of anthrax.

Mr Aggrey said investigations by the DHA revealed that the deaths were caused by the disease.

He said medicines were dispatched to the area on Monday [7 Mar 2016] to cater for about 30 people, including the 2 families of the deceased who consumed the carcasses, to prevent further deaths. The director advised the chief and people to desist from eating the meat of dead animals without proper examination by veterinary officers. The assemblyman of the area, Mr Elisha Asoswuni, said the animals of 5 farmers were affected, one losing 8 cattle and 16 sheep.

Divisional Chief of the area Naba Ramson Anamor Akotam II, commended the prompt response of the Health Directorate and said he would personally disseminate the information to his people.

District Veterinary Officer Mr Alhassan Iddi said only one community had so far been affected, but the technical officers were in the area to assess the situation while they awaited vaccines for the animals.

[So far, there is only confirmation of the cause of the 2 human deaths. There is no parallel veterinary confirmation of livestock deaths from anthrax, or the veterinary information was not made available to the Ghanian Times in the medical news release.

Anthrax has been reported in the Upper East Region in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013 in both cattle and sheep. There were human cases and deaths in 2008, 2009, 2012, and 2013. I am informed that a proactive anthrax control programme is in the planning stages in Accra. It is long needed. - Mod.MHJ
