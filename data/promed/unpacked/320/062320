Subject: Emergency Management Warning 28: Exotic Newcastle Disease Confirmed
in the United States
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) was confirmed on 1 Oct 2002, in the State of
California, and has now spread beyond backyard flocks to affect 6 commercial
operations in California. On 16 Jan 2003, END was also confirmed in a
backyard flock in the State of Nevada. Clinical signs in infected birds
include respiratory, nervous, and gastrointestinal signs. Mortality is up
to 90 percent of exposed birds. Investigations are on-going and all figures
are pending final validation. Veterinary Services is working rapidly to
expand staff on the Task Force in the States of California and Nevada and is
exploring all options to send Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) personnel, other federal government personnel, and is working with
the States to consider additional resources to meet the labor demands.

the backyard population and have established a Task Force in Nevada.

--------------------
Officials with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and
APHIS continue to work closely on efforts to control the END outbreak in
Southern California. USDA has instituted a federal quarantine zone that
serves as a buffer around the END-affected area in Southern California. The
department has also declared an extraordinary emergency to provide
additional resources and authorities to the eradication campaign for END in
Southern California.
Number of premises positive: 417 (up 18 from 1/24 report)
Number of contact premises: 990 (up 84 from 1/24 report)
Number of premises released: 15 (up 7 from 1/24 report)
[The 1/24 report was delayed by the Internet virus strike, and has been
superseded by this one. - Mod.JW]
Number of premises depopulated: 1154
Premises waiting to be depopulated: 268
Birds depopulated to date: 1 483 755
Counties with positive flocks: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, San
Diego, Ventura
Operational Update
Of the 50 premises in Nevada designated for depopulation, 62.0 percent have
been completed.
Of the 1422 premises in California designated for depopulation, 81.2 percent
have been completed.
Effective 7 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates the
interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from
Imperial, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, Santa
Barbara, and Ventura Counties, CA.
Effective 17 Jan 2003, APHIS imposed a federal quarantine that regulates the
interstate movement of all species of birds and poultry products from Clark
County and a portion of Nye County, NV.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has declared an extraordinary
emergency for the States of California and Nevada. These declarations allow
USDA to apply federal authority within California and Nevada.
Task Force personnel are conducting a door-to-door campaign to identify
affected premises. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing. Entities
that sell birds continue to be monitored in affected areas. If a flock
tests positive, officials will quarantine the premises immediately and order
the destruction of the flock as soon as it is logistically possible.
Once affected premises are identified and birds humanely depopulated,
affected areas are being thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. Landfills,
composting, and rendering are being used for safe disposal of affected birds
and materials.
Task Force personnel, in close collaboration with the California State
Highway Patrol, are exploring the possibility of establishing inspection
stations on Interstate 5. Personnel are also discussing border control and
voluntary compliance issues.
CDFA, Division of Fairs and Expositions has issued an official
recommendation that the California Fairs Boards adopt a local policy to
suspend all poultry shows for the 2003 fairs season.
Outreach Activities
-----------------
Task Force personnel conducted a public meeting in Riverside County, CA,
that was facilitated by local city officials. Approximately 100 local
residents attended. In connection with program activities in Riverside
County, information personnel held a briefing for Congressman Ken Calvert.
According to field representatives, the Congressman fully supports END
program activities.
Task Force public relations personnel are in close contact with various city
officials and regularly distribute information on Task Force activities in
affected communities. Recent additions to the public relations staff have
provided an opportunity to work in direct contact with officials in
high-risk cities.
Task Force personnel are working to prepare information and outreach
materials concerning quarantine enforcement. Public relations staff is
working with representatives of California's Department of Transportation
and the California State Highway Patrol.

[USDA indicates that the number of infected premises is continually
changing, as is the number of birds depopulated. It is expected that
official figures may not agree with figures indicated by many popular news
agencies. However, approximately 9 million commercial birds of California's
12 million birds are within the quarantine zone. Depopulation to control the
disease continues. - Mod.TG]
