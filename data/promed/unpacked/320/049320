2004/173 _Valsa ceratosperma_ found in Lombardia (IT)
-----------------------------------------------------
A new canker disease of pear caused by _Valsa ceratosperma_ [Vc] (EPPO Alert
List) was recently reported in Emilia-Romagna, Italy (see EPPO RS 2004/052).
It is now reported in Lombardia, at Schivenoglia (province of Mantova). Vc
was observed in a pear orchard of approximately 2 ha in which 50 percent of
plants of cv. Abate Fetel were infected. Affected plants showed cankers on
twigs, branches and trunks, leading to desiccation and death of distal parts.

[The disease occurs in the EPPO region (Italy- Emilia-Romagna, Lombardia) and
in Asia (China, Japan and Korea). In Italy containment measures are taken to
prevent any further spread. However, the disease it causes on pear, apple and
quince has only been observed in the Asian countries mentioned above and now
in Italy. Vc most likely is present in plants for planting, such as
_Cydonia_, _Malus_ and _Pyrus_ where Vc occurs. Fruit crops such as pear,
apple and quince are important for the EPPO region. Control of canker
diseases is usually difficult in practice. Mechanical removal of cankers is a
possibility. Data is currently lacking on chemical products which may be
effective against Vc. In Italy, high incidence in affected orchards and crop
losses has been reported. Any further spread of this disease should be
avoided.
