Begomoviruses Associated with Leaf Curl Disease of Tomato in Java, Indonesia

Several begomoviruses are associated with tomato leaf curl disease in Java,
Indonesia. Tomato plants with leaf curl symptoms were collected from
Bandung (west Java), Purwokerto (central Java), Magelang (central Java) and
Malang (east Java) of Indonesia, the major tomato-growing areas of the country.
Viruses were detected using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with
universal primers for the genus _Begomovirus_. PCR-amplified fragments were
cloned and sequenced. Based on sequence comparisons and phylogenetic
analyses, the viruses were divided into 3 groups.
Group I contained viruses with amino acid (aa) identities of the N-terminal
halves of the coat proteins which were most closely related to Ageratum
yellow vein virus (AYVV) (97 percent), Ageratum yellow vein virus China
-[Hn2] (AYVCNV-[Hn2]) (96 percent), Ageratum yellow vein virus-[Taiwan]
(AYVV-[Tai]) (95 percent) and an ageratum-infecting begomovirus from Java
(99 percent).
Group II had high sequence identity with a tentative species of Tomato leaf
curl Java virus (ToLCJAV) (96 percent aa) for the CP.
Group III was most closely related to a proposed species of Pepper yellow
leaf curl Indonesia virus (PepYLCIDV) (90 percent aa identity) by its
partial CP sequence.

[Ageratum yellow vein disease is caused by the whitefly-transmitted
monopartite begomovirus Ageratum yellow vein virus (AYVV) and a DNA beta
satellite component. Naturally occurring symptomatic plants also contain an
autonomously replicating nanovirus-like DNA 1 component that relies on the
begomovirus and DNA beta for systemic spread and whitefly transmission but
is not required for maintenance of the disease.
Systemic movement of DNA 1 occurs in _Nicotiana benthamiana_ when
co-inoculated with the bipartite begomovirus Tomato golden mosaic virus and
the curtovirus Beet curly top virus (BCTV), but not with the mastrevirus
Bean yellow dwarf virus. BCTV also mediates systemic movement of DNA 1 in
sugar beet, and the nanovirus-like component is transmitted between plants
by the BCTV leafhopper vector _Circulifer tenellus_. A 2nd nanovirus-like
component, referred to as DNA 2, has only 47 percent nucleotide sequence
identity with DNA 1.
AYVV disease occurs throughout the Indian subcontinent (Nepal, India,
Pakistan), China and parts of Africa. The disease may be associated with
distinct virus species at these locations. _Ageratum conyzoides_, a weed
species widely distributed throughout southeast Asia, frequently exhibits
striking yellow vein symptoms associated with infection by AYVV
_Geminiviridae_ (genus _Begomovirus_). The widespread presence of
AYVV-infected _Ageratum conyzoides_ constitutes a major inoculum source.
Ageratum ranges from Southeastern North America to Central America, but the
center of origin is in Central America and the Caribbean. Most taxa are
found in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean, and Florida. _Ageratum
conyzoides_ now is found in several countries in tropical and sub-tropical
regions, including Brazil. It is widely utilized in traditional medicine by
various cultures worldwide.
