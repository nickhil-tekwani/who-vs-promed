Sierra Leone: Doctors abandon isolation centre at Connaught Hospital
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Country Director of UK-based Kings Health Partners, an organisation that currently operates in Sierra Leone, Francis Kaikumba, has expressed disappointment over the abandonment of the refurbished former Ebola isolation centre, after his organisation spent close to a million pounds sterling to rehabilitate and transform the centre into a special emergency unit with 79 beds. "With funds from the Department of International Development (DFID), we have rehabilitated the centre and the outpatient edifice with extra facilities that are 1st of its kind in Sierra Leone," he said, adding that a resuscitation machine and oxygen inhaler to help unconscious patients were made available in the hospital for the 1st time.

He pleaded with the public to be making the best out of the facility regardless of the paucity of doctors at the unit. He mentioned lack of maintenance as one of the challenges facing the unit, adding that they would facilitate a training of specialist doctors to man the facility. Meanwhile, Concord Times discovered that the centre has been abandoned because doctors are fearful of contracting the Ebola virus disease there. ... - more

Q&A with Scott Halstead
-----------------------
[excerpt]

Q: Chikungunya 1st surfaced in the Caribbean in modern times in 2013. How long do you think it is going to stay around?

A: 5 years, max. The only model I have is India. I watched when chikungunya went from Africa to India in 1963 and it disappeared from India in about 5 years.

Q: Zika?

A: Zika's the same.

Q: There's a big rush to make vaccines against chikungunya and Zika because there's fear. But for Brazil, for example, by the time there's a vaccine, you're suggesting the country's population may well be largely immune to Zika.

A: Exactly. It's like Ebola. It will be gone. We're going to have this Ebola vaccine, which is about 85 percent done, and it will sit there until the next outbreak.

There are a lot of people saying there's going to be Zika and chikungunya in these new places forever. I just don't think so. Based on the observations that I've made and that anybody can see with their own eyes if they look at the data, this virus is just going to burn itself out. There's only a need for a vaccine in the acute emergency. ... - more

[Scott, now 86, is one of the world's foremost authorities on viruses spread by mosquitoes, including dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and chikungunya. I agree with him. When a population survey is done in the West African Ebola hotspots, I'm willing to bet we will find that a large proportion of the local people are immune from asymptomatic or otherwise unrecognized Ebola infection, and the epidemic has simply burned out. This is not to belittle the advances in therapy with resulting lowered death rate bought by the billions of dollars of international aid spent there and elsewhere, or the production of vaccines. I just hope it will be possible to freeze-dry Ebola vaccine in bulk to extend its shelf life, lower storage costs and allow reconstitution in the field as required. - Mod.JW]

[7/8 mice that received BCX443 survived; no other mice that were given ribavirin or placebo survived for more than 28 days. We look forward to hearing the results of Phase I human trials. - Mod.JW]
