A South Florida citrus canker quarantine could edge up Florida's Atlantic
coast to Palm Beach County, making the sale or movement of citrus illegal
here, agricultural officials said Thursday.
Mark Fagan, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Agriculture, said
that a quarantine is being considered although there have been no further
signs of canker in Palm Beach County.
The deadly disease affecting citrus trees is caused by the bacterium
_Xanthomonas axonopodis_ pathovar citri. The deadly disease affecting
citrus trees recently moved north from quarantined Miami-Dade and Broward
counties into Boca Raton, the first sightings in Palm Beach County. Fagan
said a proposed extension of the quarantine area would reach five miles
north across the Broward County line into southern Palm Beach County.
Last week, seven trees in Boca Raton were destroyed after showing signs of
the disease. Four others were cut down and burned because they had been
exposed to canker, Fagan said.
Florida already has cut down and burned at least 500 000 trees in its war
on the Asia A-strain of citrus canker, most of them in back yards and
groves in Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Growers in that established
quarantine area already have lost more than half of the fruit of their $20
million-a-year industry, which consists mostly of lime trees.
State and federal agricultural officials said the Boca Raton canker likely
was spread from landscaping equipment that had been in an infected area
farther south.

[If contaminated landscaping equipment was indeed involved in spreading the
disease northward, it behooves personnel employed by landscaping companies
to be much more vigilant in cleaning equipment before moving into
canker-free areas. It must be a very discouraging battle. - Mod.DH
