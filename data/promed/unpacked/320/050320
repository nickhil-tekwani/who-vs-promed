Anthrax Outbreak in the Melfort Area
-------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CIFA) is investigating an
anthrax outbreak in the Melfort area. So far, there are only 2
positive cases in cattle. However, another 50-55 animals have died in
the past 4 days. The cases are concentrated on farms within the Rural
Municipalities of Kinistino and Willow Creek. The farms are within an
area of 10 to 15 km. 35 samples have been sent to the CFIA lab in
Lethbridge to determine whether the animals died of anthrax. Results
are expected Wednesday or Thursday [5, 6 Jul 2006].
Dr. Greg Douglas is a CFIA Veterinary Program Specialist. He says 600
head have been vaccinated for anthrax to prevent further spread of
the disease. Additional vaccine is being shipped from the CFIA depot
in Winnipeg. Horses, sheep and goats will also be vaccinated.
Anthrax is carried by spores, which can live in the soil for decades.
The disease is not spread from animal to animal. Dr. Douglas says the
spores were likely exposed by heavy rain and erosion over the last
several weeks. This could be the largest anthrax outbreak in
Saskatchewan in recent memory. Last year [2005] in Manitoba, there
was a cluster of 20 positive cases.
Dr. Douglas says farmers in the Melfort area should check their herds
regularly and immediately report any suspicious deaths to the CFIA or
their local veterinarian.

[Over the years, there have been regular but sporadic outbreaks of
livestock anthrax in Saskatchewan. Obviously, soil contamination has
played a part, but I must admit to a personal suspicion that maybe
contaminated bone meal may sometimes have played a part, especially
on ranches with no previous history of anthrax, a relative freedom at
best, as ranch memories can sometimes be uncertain. Also, a number of
ranchers do not get out regularly to check their stock and can find
an animal dead and call the local renderer to deal with it without
reference to probable cause. All in all, it encourages
non-vaccination. With 55 dead, the outbreak has probably been going
for a week to 10 days. Reading between the lines, there have been
heavy rains lately. Quite apart from eroding old cattle graves, this
encourages horse fly numbers, and with some 55 infected animals to
feed upon, the local ranchers within 10 miles would be wise to get
their stock up and vaccinated pronto. - Mod.MHJ]
