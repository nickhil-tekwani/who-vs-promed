Egyptian girl dies of bird flu
------------------------------
A 16-year-old girl died of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu on Mon
15 Dec 2008, the 23rd fatality and 51st case of the disease among
humans in Egypt, state news agency MENA said. The girl from a village
in the central Egyptian province of Asyut caught the disease after
exposure to sick household poultry, MENA quoted a health ministry
official as saying. The official said the girl began suffering
symptoms a week ago, after 2 of the household ducks died and the
remainder of the flock was slaughtered in the house.

The girl was subsequently admitted to hospital with a high fever,
vomiting, and diarrhea, and then transferred to intensive care. She
was treated with the antiviral drug Tamiflu, but suffered a pulmonary
infection and respiratory failure, and died on Monday [15 Dec 2008].

Her death is the 1st bird flu fatality in Egypt since April [2008],
and the 1st of the current winter season [when transmission of the
virus is thought to be increased. - Mod.CP] The virus, which first
appeared in Egypt in February 2006, tends to be less active in summer.

About 5 million households in Egypt depend on poultry as a main
source of food and income, and the government has said this makes it
unlikely the disease can be eradicated despite a large-scale poultry
vaccination programme.

Experts fear the H5N1 virus might mutate or combine with the highly
contagious seasonal influenza virus and spark a pandemic that could
kill millions of people. Since the virus resurfaced in Asia in 2003,
it has killed more than 200 [246] people in a dozen countries, the
World Health Organisation (WHO) says. Egypt has been the worst hit
country outside Asia.

[In the past the Egyptians have had relative success in treating
avian flu patients with Tamiflu. Perhaps on this occasion treatment
was initiated too late or a more resistant virus has appeared.
