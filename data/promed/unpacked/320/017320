On 6 Oct 2009, the US Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
(APHIS) confirmed the presence of '_Candidatus_ Liberibacter
asiaticus,' or citrus greening (CG) or huanglongbing [HLB], from 3
citrus plant samples collected from the University of Puerto Rico
Agricultural Experiment Station, located in the municipality of
Isabela, Puerto Rico. Subsequent surveys revealed the presence of the
disease in the municipalities of Carolina, Ceiba, Culebra, and San
Sebastian.

APHIS and the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture continue to
delimit the extent of the disease. The insect vector responsible for
transmitting this disease, Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), is also
present in Puerto Rico.

APHIS is expanding the CG quarantine area to include the entire
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Interstate movement of citrus and other
rutaceous host plants of ACP and their products are restricted.

[Huanglongbing (HLB, also called citrus greening), is one of the most
damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruits. In
northern and central America and in the Caribbean area, it is caused
by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_
Liberibacter asiaticus. Fruits become unmarketable and trees may die
prematurely. The pathogen is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid
(_Diaphorina citri_), as well as by grafting and possibly seed
transmission. Disease management requires an integrated approach
including phytosanitary measures, elimination of inoculum, and vector
control. For more information on HLB see links and previous
ProMED-mail posts listed below.
