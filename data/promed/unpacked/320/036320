The 1st anthrax case in Texas for 2015 has been confirmed in equine in Uvalde County. The premises is located about 25 miles [40.2 km] north west of Uvalde. The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has quarantined the premises. TAHC rules require proper disposal of affected carcasses and vaccination of livestock on the premises prior to release of the quarantine.

Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by _Bacillus anthracis_, which is a naturally occurring organism with worldwide distribution, including certain parts of Texas. (It is not uncommon for anthrax to be diagnosed in the south western part of the state.) A vaccine is available for use in susceptible livestock in high risk areas.

Acute fever followed by rapid death with bleeding from body openings are common signs of anthrax in livestock. Carcasses may also appear bloated and decompose quickly. Livestock displaying signs consistent with anthrax should be reported to a private veterinary practitioner or a TAHC official. If affected livestock or carcasses must be handled, producers are encouraged to follow basic sanitation precautions such as wearing protective gloves, long sleeve shirts and washing thoroughly afterward to prevent accidental spread of the bacteria to people.

"The TAHC will continue to closely monitor the situation for possible new cases across the state. Producers are encouraged to consult their veterinary practitioner or local TAHC office if they have questions about the disease in livestock and their medical professional if they have concerns about anthrax exposure," said Dr TR Lansford, TAHC assistant executive director for animal health programs.

For more information regarding anthrax, contact your local TAHC region or call 1-800-550-8242 or visit http://www.tahc.texas.gov. To learn more about anthrax, visit the TAHC's brochure at http://www.tahc.state.tx.us/news/brochures/TAHCBrochure_Anthrax.pdf.

Anthrax in animals most commonly occurs following ingestion of the organism, but can also occur by acquisition of the organism in aerosols or via wounds. Herbivores are the most susceptible to disease, while pigs and carnivores are relatively less susceptible. We more commonly expect anthrax in cattle and deer but other animals are not uncommon.

Clinical presentations of anthrax in cattle:
- peracute death is a common manifestation. Hemorrhage may or may not be externally evident in these peracute cases.
- subacute anthrax can also occur in cattle and small ruminants. Signs include fever and inappetence; hematuria, hematochezia (passage of bright red, bloody stools), peripheral edema; splenomegaly; respiratory distress; behavioral changes and seizures (reflecting CNS edema and hemorrhage). Blood in the body typically does not clot. Rigor mortis is often absent.

Anthrax in horses: infection may present initially as colic and enteritis, followed by development of edema, hemorrhage, and death in 2-4 days.

Anthrax in pigs and dogs: pigs and dogs generally have a more limited course of disease, with gastroenteritis and pharyngeal edema. However, the pharyngeal edema may lead to death by asphyxiation.

In endemic areas in the world, animals can be immunized with a vaccine made from spores of an avirulent strain ("Stern vaccine"). In incubator regions of some states in the US (such as the Dakotas), vaccination is also still commonly practiced today. However, in other areas, vaccination is only by authority of the state veterinarian.

Diagnosis of anthrax in animals:
- A diagnosis is most often made by identification of the organism in blood from an infected animal. Blood smears can be directly stained for the organism, or the organism can be readily cultured. Necropsies should not be performed because of the risk of inducing sporulation and spreading the organism. Blood should be collected with as little contact as possible with the carcass (such as, cutting off the tip of the ear or incising into the coronary band) and then the carcass should be burned thoroughly or buried deep and covered with quick lime (calcium oxide). Quick lime acts to pull water out of the carcass and thereby speed decomposition. In pigs, unlike cattle, organisms are often difficult to find in peripheral blood smears.
- There are also fluorescent Ab-, ELISA-, and PCR-based laboratory tests available and an immunochromatographic rapid diagnosis field test.
