Skin infection spreads among gay men in L.A.
-----------------------------------------------
With infections that outsmart powerful antibiotics on the rise, doctors and
public health officials have long worried that they might face an outbreak
of resistant bacteria that threaten large numbers of people. Now they've
found it -- in Los Angeles County. The outbreak of methicillin resistant
_Staphylococcus aureus_ [MRSA] is the first reported in that population.
The large, painful skin infections started turning up early last fall [2002]
among local gay men, then appeared with increasing frequency over the
ensuing weeks and months. Although doctors found the symptoms alarming, it
took a while to confirm a connection between these cases. Now they know
they're facing an emerging epidemic of drug-resistant _Staphylococcus
aureus_ or, more simply, staph.
Although the outbreak seems confined primarily to gay men, doctors say at
least one woman contracted the infection, probably from a male sex partner.
Because they still know so little about the extent of the outbreak, they
can't predict how many people it may eventually affect.
The infection, which causes nasty-looking boils, deep abscesses, and
widespread surrounding inflammation, has proved impervious to common
antibiotics. Although it appears to be spread primarily by skin-to-skin
contact, including sex, its origins and precise mode of transmission remain
a mystery. Doctors treating it caution that it could also be contracted at
health clubs, steam rooms, and other warm, moist environments.
"The concern is this organism could spread to and cause disease in the
community at large," said Dr. Peter Ruane, an infectious disease specialist
in Los Angeles. "It seems to be able to attack normal skin in healthy
people."
County health officials, with assistance from the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, have begun a public health investigation to
understand how the infection is spread, determine who else may be affected
and develop strategies to contain it.
"Primary-care doctors and ER doctors need to know about this so that when
they encounter these infections, they can prescribe a drug that's active
against resistant staph," Ruane said. Treatment typically involves draining
the abscess, culturing the bacteria to see what they are resistant to, then
prescribing appropriate antibiotics.
Cases of drug-resistant staph, long recognized as a problem in nursing homes
and hospitals, have increasingly cropped up in clusters outside those
settings. But the current outbreak marks the first time resistant staph has
been reported in the gay community, which doctors say gives it the potential
to spread widely and quickly, because many of their gay patients frequent
circuit parties and bathhouses, engaging in sex with multiple partners.
Medical treatment has resolved most of the infections, with more aggressive
cases requiring prolonged hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. In
some cases, the infections have taken up to a month to clear up. However,
because staph isn't spread through the air like the flu, it would be less
likely than those infections to cause widespread disease and fill emergency
rooms.
Still, although no one has died, doctors are grappling with the daunting
prospect that the bug will outsmart additional antibiotics, further
narrowing treatment options. They know that in cases in which the infection
spreads to the blood, it can prove fatal if antibiotics fail or it goes
untreated.
Dr. Gary Cohan, managing director of Pacific Oaks Medical Group in Beverly
Hills, one of the nation's largest private AIDS practices, says he used to
see one antibiotic-resistant staph case a year among hospitalized AIDS
patients. Now, 2 patients a week come to the office with "abscesses filled
with a viciously resistant staph."
Because _Staphylococcus aureus_ lives on the skin's surface, usually
existing harmlessly in the nose, armpits, and groin, infections typically
start in a cut or other opening. But the infections seen in local gay men --
the majority with well-controlled HIV or AIDS, but many others in good
health -- took hold in unbroken skin. Doctors also noticed that the painful
boils and abscesses were in rather unusual places: the legs, buttocks,
penis, and scrotum, as well as hands and face.
Ruane, an AIDS specialist and director of research at Tower Infectious
Disease Medical Associates in Los Angeles, is aware of 40 cases among his
and colleagues' patients. Others may go unrecognized because some people
drain their own boils and never seek medical care. Ruane sent specimens to
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's microbiology lab, where they were analyzed by
a scientist, Margie A. Morgan, and her boss, Dr. Steven Nichols. Using a
scientific technique called molecular fingerprinting, the 2 found, as
suspected, the cases involved a genetically identical strain of resistant
staph. They also found that the strain contains a powerful toxin called
Panton-Valentine leukocidin seen in resistant staph outbreaks in France and
in this country. No one knows whether that toxin is responsible for the
microbe's ability to break through the skin, and Morgan is looking for other
toxins. The county is sending samples to the CDC for further tests and to
see if the same strain has been seen elsewhere.
Already, microbiologist Barry N. Kreiswirth, a researcher at the nonprofit
Public Health Research Institute in Newark, N.J., has found that the strain
in Los Angeles is the same one he found among 39 hospitalized AIDS patients
in 1997 in New York City.
Meanwhile, local epidemiologists compared the infections among gay men to
last summer's limited outbreaks of resistant staph among 5 newborns and
among 3 young adult athletes. The staph strain in those cases matched that
seen in the gay patients. The epidemiologists also have seen the same strain
for many months in an ongoing outbreak associated with what they will only
describe as a "large institution." That outbreak remains under
investigation. Although it's unusual to have the same strain in multiple
locations, it may be that the current strain is gaining a local foothold,
they say.
"It's only in the past couple of weeks when we got the molecular
fingerprinting results that we were able to go back and connect the dots,"
said Dr. Elizabeth A. Bancroft, a medical epidemiologist with the Los
Angeles County Health Department who is leading the investigation. All the
local cases involved skin infections only; those in hospitalized patients
typically involve fever and pneumonia as well as an infected surgical site
or wound. In addition to alerting local doctors, she has launched a study
with Ruane and the Los Angeles-based AIDS Healthcare Foundation that will
try to understand the risk factors for contracting this strain. The
infections, known as methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ because
of their resistance to the antibiotic methicillin, are the bane of modern
health care because they don't respond to the cheapest and most frequently
used antibiotics, including methicillin, penicillin, and penicillin-like
cephalosporins such as Keflex [cephalexin -Mod.LL] and Ceftin [cefuroxime -
Mod.LL].
Federal figures show the percentage of staph specimens resistant to
antibiotics increased from 2 percent in 1974 to 50 percent in 1997. But not
until 1999 did the public-health community begin appreciating the severity
of the resistance problem outside hospitals. That's when the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention reported the deaths of 4 children in
Minnesota and North Dakota whose infections didn't respond to
cephalosporins. Similar outbreaks, sometimes with fatalities, have been
reported among intravenous drug abusers, athletes, prisoners, Native
Americans, and Eskimos, whose close living conditions make them likely to
share personal items such as towels.
The L.A. investigation has found that the local strain is resistant to
erythromycin and the powerful fluoroquinolones, such as Cipro
[ciprofloxacin - Mod.LL] and Levaquin [levofloxacin - Mod.LL]. That limits
the arsenal to Bactrim [trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole - Mod.LL], rifampin,
clindamycin, and the drug of last resort, vancomycin, which is administered
intravenously. Some doctors use a new antibiotic called Zyvox [linezolid -
Mod.LL], although with a single course costing $1500, they often have
trouble persuading insurers to pay for it.
Bancroft stressed that until an investigation reveals how the infections are
being spread, anyone with a boil or skin infection should maintain good
hygiene, washing towels and anything else that comes into contact with
infected areas. Any skin infection that looks particularly aggressive should
be examined and cultured by a doctor. And, anyone prescribed antibiotics
must complete the full course even if they start feeling better. "The worst
thing in the world is only to take a half-dose," Bancroft said, because that
fosters further resistance.

[MRSA has been a significant nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pathogen for
some time, but has not been commonly acquired in the community. As its
older cousin (beta-lactamase-positive _S. aureus_) was several decades ago,
MRSA is now increasingly found in the community, as shown by this report and
the previous postings below. - Mod.LL]
