High OJD infection rates could limit sheep trade
------------------------------------------------
Trading opportunities could be affected if the current rates of ovine
Johne's disease (OJD) continue, the New South Wales chief veterinary
officer, Bruce Christie, has warned.

"Targeted surveillance in abattoirs has picked up increased levels of
OJD infection in sheep originating in low and medium prevalence
areas," says Mr Christie. "Surveillance in 2008 uncovered an
infection rate of 39.8 per cent in medium prevalence areas, more than
3 times the 12.5 per cent threshold for flocks in that area. In low
prevalence areas where the threshold is 0.8 per cent, the infection
rate was also over the cut-off with 1.3 per cent.

"These trends appear to be continuing in 2009 and national data
indicates that OJD is also spreading to previously uninfected flocks
in some other states. If similar results are reported again this year
[2009], areas of OJD prevalence will need to be adjusted to take into
account the higher infection rates."

Mr Christie says changes to the prevalence areas would result in
sheep producers in reclassified areas losing assurance based credit
(ABC) points on sheep health statements, which could impact on their
trade opportunities.

"The successful risk-based trading system now in place relies on the
integrity of prevalence areas being maintained and we will make the
necessary changes to ensure the system is not compromised," he says.
"Producers who may lose area trade points and depend on a minimum ABC
score to sell re-stocker sheep should consider now how they can
protect their trade."

Trading points were also available for vaccination, testing, or
participation in the Sheep Market Assurance Program.

"OJD infection rates can be minimized if sheep producers take
appropriate steps to stop the disease from spreading," says Mr
Christie. "All producers should ask for a sheep health statement
before buying stock or bringing in stock for agistment. They should
know the ABC score of their own flock and use the sheep health
statement to assess the risk of introducing infected sheep.

"Vaccination is another key way to significantly reduce the risk of
spreading OJD. One reason for increased infection rates may be that
Gudair vaccine is not being used by producers in the medium
prevalence area or on the border of the low prevalence area. These
producers must recognize they have a significant risk of infection
due to trade with, or geographical proximity, to higher prevalence
areas," Mr Christie says.

[Since it was found in Australia in 1980, ovine Johne's disease (OJD)
has proven to be a costly disease. It spreads slowly, is difficult to
detect early on, reduces weight gain and wool production, and can
kill about 10 per cent of adult sheep each year if left unmanaged.

OJD is a wasting disease caused by the sheep strain of the bacterium
_Mycobacterium paratuberculosis_, which grows mainly in the small
intestine. The intestinal wall slowly thickens and the animal has
increasing trouble absorbing nutrients from its food. OJD has a long
incubation period, usually more than 2 years, but eventually a number
of infected animals will develop obvious signs of the disease; they
start to rapidly lose condition and usually die within the next 3 to
6 months. Scouring may occur but is not seen routinely. Merinos are
more susceptible than crossbreds and British breed sheep. Goats,
deer, and other species can be infected to varying degrees. There is
no cure for sheep with OJD.

Ovine Johne's disease (OJD) is managed in NSW on the basis of buyers
making informed decisions on the risk of OJD being in sheep they plan
to purchase, and making decisions on that basis.

There is a preventative vaccine available. The producers are
generally encouraged to vaccinate to help protect their flocks.
