The chikungunya virus, another mosquito-borne disease similar to dengue, has found its way to South Cotabato province.

Dr. Rogelio Aturdido Jr., head of the Integrated Provincial Health Office (IPHO), told Philippine Information Agency 12 yesterday that 2 cases of the disease were found in Sitio Bukang-liwayway, Barangay Kipalbig in nearby Tampakan town and validated by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine (RITM) in Metro Manila.

"The other week, we sent several serum samples to RITM. Of these, 2 were found positive of the chikungunya virus," Dr. Aturdido said.

Aturdido said although the disease is not deadly like dengue, it remains a major concern because victims could suffer from severe joint pains for up to 6 months or longer.

Information from the website of the World Health Organization (WHO) says chikungunya is a mosquito-borne disease [virus] which was 1st described in an outbreak in southern Tanzania in 1954.

Like dengue, the virus is transmitted via bites of infected female mosquitoes, mostly _Aedes aegypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_. Illness usually occurs between 2-12 days from [initial] infection.

"Chikungunya is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever frequently accompanied by joint pain. Other common signs and symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. The joint pain is often very debilitating, but usually ends within a few days or weeks. Most patients recover fully, but in some cases joint pain may persist for several months, or even years," the article continues.

"The name 'chikungunya' derives from a root verb in the Kimakonde language, meaning 'to become contorted,' and describes the stooped appearance of sufferers with joint pains."

Aturdido said that although the responsibility to address this concern rests primarily on the local government unit of Tampakan, the IPHO is ready to extend help.

He emphasized, however, that since the disease's source and means of transmission is similar to dengue, prevention of its spread is also largely dependent on community efforts.

"What is required is to strictly follow the 4S strategy," Aturdido said.

4S anti-dengue strategy consists of the following: Search and destroy; Self-protection measures; Seek early consultation; and Say no to indiscriminate fogging.

In January this year [2013], Department of Health (DOH) 12 reported that 57 cases were clinically diagnosed from Sarangani Province. The number consisted of 35 cases from Kiamba and 22 from Maitum.

According to DOH, Chikungunya cases have also been reported in Metro Manila, Laguna, Pangasinan and other parts of Mindanao.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in the Philippines, so this type of small outbreak, and the one below, are not surprising. Because there is no commercially available vaccine for chikungunya virus, the only preventive action is elimination of _Aedes_ vector mosquito breeding sites and avoidance of mosquito bites per the 4S strategy mentioned above.

Health officials have declared a chikungunya outbreak in 3 barangays in Patnongon, Antique province -- Mabasa, Magsaysay Tamayok and Poblacion, where 6 people tested positive for the disease and nearly 100 more are being monitored.

The Department of Health (DOH) has extended its monitoring and probe of other possible cases in nearby areas.

Like dengue, chikungunya [virus] is contracted through mosquitoes and also has similar symptoms.

Health officials reminded the public to keep their surroundings clean [to eliminate mosquito breeding sites] and not to self-medicate if they start exhibiting symptoms of chikungunya.

Health authorities fear a dengue-like mosquito-borne virus could spread through far north Queensland following a massive outbreak in Papua New Guinea (PNG).

Since the start of the year [2013], 11 people in Queensland have been diagnosed with chikungunya [virus infection], which causes fever, rashes and prolonged joint pain.

[Of these 11,] 10 of the people contracted the virus in PNG, where more than 3000 people have been hit by the virus. Another person was bitten by a mosquito in Indonesia before flying to Queensland.

The majority of the 11 affected are Australian citizens but almost half of them live outside far north Queensland.

Tropical Public Health Services director Dr Richard Gair says the PNG outbreak is recent and could lead to an outbreak in far north Queensland.

He says this is because the same type of mosquitoes that carry the virus live in both areas.

"Every import is a potential outbreak," he said. "If you get bitten when you're still infectious, that mosquito can go and bite someone else."

No one has been infected by chikungunya [virus] while in Australia.

Those who have chikungunya [virus infections] experience the same symptoms as [those with] dengue fever, and both diseases are spread by the same mosquitoes.

"The difference between them is that with chikungunya we might well see the transmission happening quite a bit faster," Mr Gair said. "There is less time between cases so it is harder to control."

Since January [2013] there have been about 170 cases of dengue in the Cairns region.

Chikungunya [virus] was 1st found in East Africa about 50 years ago but has only recently spread to countries close to Australia.

Mr Gair says the best way to eliminate both chikungunya and dengue is to get rid of mosquito breeding sites, such as pots of water around properties.

[There is a very real risk of ongoing chikungunya virus transmission in northern Queensland. As the above report mentions, the mosquito vectors of the virus are present there and transmitting dengue virus.

Importation of chikungunya virus into Australia is not surprising. There is an ongoing chikungunya virus outbreak on Papua New Guinea this year (2013) and there was a significant outbreak on the main island of Papua New Guinea last year (2012). From June to October 2012, a total of 633 patients suspected of having symptoms of chikungunya were reported from Vanimo hospital. The outbreak was localized to the town vicinity and its satellite communities (see ProMED-mail archive no 20121010.1335814).

The above report does not indicate where in Indonesia the single chikungunya virus infection was acquired. However, Bali is a popular tourist destination. Bali has had sporadic outbreaks.
