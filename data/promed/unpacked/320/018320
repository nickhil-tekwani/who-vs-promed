A new outbreak of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infections from a not yet identified food has been added to the list of outbreaks under investigation by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA reference #1127]. [See FDA Investigations of Foodborne Illness Outbreaks at https://www.fda.gov/food/outbreaks-foodborne-illness/investigations-foodborne-illness-outbreaks]

There are 2 confirmed patients, but the FDA has not revealed their ages or states of residence.

This outbreak is separate from another outbreak of infections from _Listeria monocytogenes_ announced 9 Nov 2022 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In that outbreak there are 16 confirmed patients, one of whom has died. Also, one of the patients is a pregnant woman who lost her baby because of the infection. Thirteen of the patients have required hospitalization. [See ProMED post Listeriosis - USA (08): fatal, ready-to-eat deli meats and cheeses, 2021-22, RFI 20221111.8706690.]

In the 2-patient outbreak announced by the FDA, the agency has begun traceback efforts but has not reported what food or foods are being traced. On-site inspection and sample testing have not yet begun.

An Outbreak Advisory for a _Listeria monocytogenes_ outbreak from Brie and Camembert cheese was issued on 30 Sep 2022. Recall information was updated on 28 Oct 2022. It reported that 7 patients from 6 different states have been confirmed ill. Five have been hospitalized, according to the CDC.

[A cluster of listeriosis cases is usually declared a common source outbreak if the _Listeria_ clinical isolates have similar genotypes, based on whole genome sequencing (WGS). However, we are not told if genotyping of isolates was done, demographic factors that may be related to risk of illness, clinical characteristics of the 2 cases, when and where these 2 cases occurred, if there are any other epidemiologic factors linking these 2 cases, and what common food items they consumed.

More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
