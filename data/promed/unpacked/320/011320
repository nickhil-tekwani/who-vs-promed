[Interestingly, D. Scott Simpson AP-C, communicating from a clinic in the USA Virgin Islands, reports seeing continued cases of prominent posterior adenopathy. He also suggested that there should be studies on the range of clinical presentations of chikungunya virus infections in the Americas. It occurs to me that assessing the range of clinical symptoms presented in acute cases and in subsequent cases of persistent arthralgias would make an interesting study for graduate students of public health, and provide a basis for comparison with cases in Asia and Africa.

[2] Virus-vector relationships
Date: Mon 24 Nov 2014

Lark L. Coffey, Anna-Bella Failloux and Scott C. Chikungunya Virus-Vector Interactions

Abstract
--------
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes chikungunya fever, a severe, debilitating disease that often produces chronic arthralgia. Since 2004, CHIKV has emerged in Africa, Indian Ocean islands, Asia, Europe, and the Americas, causing millions of human infections. Central to understanding CHIKV emergence is knowledge of the natural ecology of transmission and vector infection dynamics. This review presents current understanding of CHIKV infection dynamics in mosquito vectors and its relationship to human disease emergence. The following topics are reviewed: CHIKV infection and vector life history traits including transmission cycles, genetic origins, distribution, emergence and spread, dispersal, vector competence, vector immunity and microbial interactions, and co-infection by CHIKV and other arboviruses. The genetics of vector susceptibility and host range changes, population heterogeneity and selection for the fittest viral genomes, dual host cycling and its impact on CHIKV adaptation, viral bottlenecks and intrahost diversity, and adaptive constraints on CHIKV evolution are also discussed. The potential for CHIKV re-emergence and expansion into new areas and prospects for prevention via vector control are also briefly reviewed.

Future Prospects
----------------
Potential for Re-Emergence and Expansion into New Areas
Due to the immunologically almost completely naive status of human populations and the widespread and abundant _A. aegypti_ nearly throughout the western hemisphere tropics, CHIKV is expected to continue to spread and ultimately recapitulate the distribution of dengue viruses (DENV) in the Americas. The lack of historical evidence for a major role of _A. albopictus_ in transmission of Asian lineage CHIKV strains and the adaptive constraint described above suggest that temperate American regions inhabited by _A. albopictus_ but not _A. aegypti_ may not be at as high a level of risk as regions where IOL strains (Indian Ocean lineage) are circulating. However, IOL strains continue to circulate in Asia and have a history of many importations into the Americas [182], so their risk of introduction into the Americas continues. Should both Asian and IOL strains cocirculate, as they have in Southeast Asia since 2007, even more geographic regions of the Americas could be at risk for CHIK.

Conclusions
-----------
Chikungunya virus has caused explosive outbreaks of severe, debilitating and often chronic arthralgia since it emerged in the 1950s and later in 2004 from the enzootic ECSA lineage in Africa. The large populations of susceptible humans in many naive regions and thriving populations of the two urban vectors, _A. aegypti_ and _A. albopictus_, will probably facilitate endemicity throughout most regions of the tropics and subtropics for the foreseeable future, although the burden of disease is typically difficult to estimate because CHIKV and DENV infections are difficult to distinguish clinically. Further adaptation of CHIKV to these urban vectors is also suggested by recent findings. Future emergences from enzootic African cycles will also remain a risk that is increasing with more and more air travel and international commerce. Although novel strategies to control vector populations and reduce transmission are in early stages of field testing, the deployment of one of several highly promising human vaccines probably offers the best hope for making a major impact in restricting CHIKV circulation and preventing human disease.
