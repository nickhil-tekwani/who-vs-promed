Children in the city [Nagpur, Maharashtra] are being affected by a
benign viral infection that causes lesions similar to those caused by
chickenpox. However, hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), being a
self-limiting condition, doctors say parents need not worry.

"We have seen more cases of the disease over the past month. I see at
least one child with the condition every day, much more than in the
past," said Dr Kuldeep Sukhdeve, a senior paediatrician of the city.
He is quick to add that this should not be a cause for panic or fear
among the parents. "In fact, the kid does not need to be vaccinated,
neither does it require to visit the doctor," he said. He revealed
that anyone with a reasonably strong immune system could get over the
disease within a week.

"In the more severe version of the disease, it may last for about
10-15 days or there might be slight pain in the lesions. The medicines
administered during the [treatment of] HFMD are those for treating the
fever or itching that accompanies it," informed paediatrician Dr
Sanjay Marathe. Doctors also said that many times the condition is
confused with chickenpox, a comparatively serious illness. In several
cases, the condition goes unnoticed as the blisters may resemble those
got through insect bites.

A dermatologist's 6-year-old daughter complained of slight pain in the
mouth while eating. On close inspection by her husband [also a
doctor], they found the child had ulcers in the mouth. The little girl
also had a few lesions on her hands and feet. When [the dermatologist]
enquired with her colleagues, she discovered that the child had
acquired HFMD. "Fortunately, the children have their holidays now, so
there is no chance of her transmitting it to the other kids," she said.

HFMD, commonly observed in children, has symptoms like fever and sore
throat. Peculiar lesions, then, start appearing on the trunk, palms,
soles, and face. It is a mildly contagious condition and can be
avoided by following the basic rules of hygiene. Several districts of
Andhra Pradesh witnessed a surge in HFMD cases last month [November
2010]. Last year [2009], Kolkata had 62 cases, the largest occurrence
of HFMD in India.

[Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) affects the skin and mucous membranes,
causing painful sores to appear inside the mouth, on the hands and
feet, and occasionally on the buttocks or genitals. If this account
accurately reflects the situation throughout India, HFMD would appear
to be less prevalent and less severe in India than elsewhere in Asia.

HFMD is a reflection of exposure to enterovirus infection and often
associated with poor standards of hygiene and child care. Enteroviral
infections usually resolve completely, but infections of the heart or
central nervous system are occasionally fatal. In parts of Asia where
enterovirus 71 is prevalent HFMD infection may have serious outcome,
to such an extent that a vaccine is under development.

Nagpur in the state of Maharashtra is located at the geographical
centre of India. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of India
