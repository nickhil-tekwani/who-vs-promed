U.S. restricts food imports from Belgium.
The United States has banned imported cattle, sheep, their meat and many
related products from Belgium after a case of mad cow disease was reported
there last month.
"This emergency measure was taken to protect animal and public health,"
Joan M. Arnoldi, deputy administrator for veterinary services with the
Agriculture Department's animal inspection agency, said Tuesday.
No case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy has ever been reported in the
United States. Since 1989, the government has banned imports of live
animals and many products derived from them from countries where the
disease is known to exist.
Eating meat from cattle tainted by this disease is believed to cause
nv-CJD, which has killed some 20 people.
Belgium is not a major exporter of meat to the United States.
Other countries affected by the U.S. import ban are Britain, France,
Ireland, Oman, Portugal, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Belgium reported
its first case of BSE on Oct. 31.

[While this may appear to be a bureaucratic exercise, it should be
remembered that this formally shuts an importation door through which beef
of other origins might have found their way. Martin Hugh-Jones,
