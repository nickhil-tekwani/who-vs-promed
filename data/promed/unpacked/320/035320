The health department has charted out an action plan to combat chikungunya cases. The move follows the reporting of more cases of these diseases in the [Thiruvananthapuram] district during the past few days.

Health minister V S Sivakumar said a special drive against this disease in 25 hot spots, where more cases have been reported, will be launched in the next 2 weeks. "Necessary instructions have been given to strengthen fogging and source reduction activities in public places and households," he said.

Primary health centres in corporation wards will coordinate the fever prevention activities. Unlike dengue, the increase in chikungunya cases in city areas has created a concern. As many as 53 chikungunya cases were reported in the state capital in August [2013], [compared to] around 25 [up to June 2013].
