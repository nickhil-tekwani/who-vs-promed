[This is the 2nd part of the daily update following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on selected countries of interest.

To reduce the size of these posts, there will be changes over the coming days. The tables will be reduced but are available at the source URLs and will be referred to in the summaries of daily changes for each country. Countries that have almost interrupted transmission and have been lifting restrictions (China, South Korea) and have lessons to learn as they attempt to prevent explosive 2nd waves will continue to be profiled. We will attempt to select countries from each region on a daily basis. - Mod.UBA]

[According to the report above, in the past 24 hours, there have been 11 newly confirmed cases in China, all imported. No new deaths were reported. Also, no new cases were reported in Hong Kong or in Macau. A total of 1797 imported cases have been reported. There have been no new deaths reported for several weeks, further supporting a reduced level of cases in the country.

There were 4 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic individuals in the past 24 hours, 3 of which were imported. There was 1 case of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The recent previous reports of a conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic were on 4, 6, and 8 Jun 2020 when 1 conversion was reported each time. Prior to that, there were 2 cases on 1 Jun 2020, and a single case was reported on 18 May 2020 (COVID-19 update (194): China, S Korea, countries w/ high local trans, Italy phase 2 20200519.7352327).

Recurrent questions: What is the total number of asymptomatic cases? What is the total number of asymptomatic cases that converted to symptomatic? What is the proportion of asymptomatic imported cases that have been linked to transmission chains resulting in outbreak clusters?

The English language page, notice 368 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030), provides updates on clusters as of today (11 Jun 2020):

- Coupang logistics center cluster in Bucheon-si, Gyeonggi Province: 2 additional cases were confirmed from testing for release from self-quarantine. In total, 146 cases have been confirmed.
- The newly planted churches in the Seoul Metropolitan Region: 2 additional cases were confirmed. In total, 94 cases have been confirmed.
- Richway in Gwangak-gu, Seoul: 116 cases have been confirmed in total to date. Epidemiological investigation revealed that a case confirmed on 3 Jun [2020] related to Jesus Malsseum Silcheon Church had visited Richway on 21 May [2020]. The 9 cases related to Jesus Malsseum Silcheon Church have been reclassified and are now included in the Richway cluster.
- The sport facility in Yangcheon-gu, Seoul: 6 additional cases were confirmed. The new cases are contacts of visitor(s) to the table tennis facility. In total, 60 cases have been confirmed.
- Defense Security Support Command in Gwacheon-si, Gyeonggi Province: 2 additional cases were confirmed. The new cases are family members of confirmed case(s). In total, 7 cases have been confirmed.
- Korea National Institute of Health will distribute COVID-19-positive respiratory specimens to support development of diagnostic devices for COVID-19 and COVID-19-related research.
- KCDC has collected about 1700 leftover COVID-19-positive respiratory specimens from testing laboratories and medical institutions. KNIH will distribute them through application and review process.
- Since COVID-19 symptoms are often mild and non-specific, many infected persons go unnoticed and are confirmed after having already transmitted onward to other people. KCDC advises high precaution.
- Since COVID-19 outbreak can occur from any venue under crowded, confined, and close-contact environment, residents of the Seoul Metropolitan Region are advised to avoid club meetings, religious small group meetings, and other gatherings taking place in poorly ventilated enclosed areas and to practice handwashing, mask wearing, and physical distancing in daily life.
- Anyone who has come in close contact with a large number of unspecified persons is advised to dial 1339 or contact a local public health center and get tested at a screening clinic if fever or respiratory symptoms appear.
- Testing is advised especially if 2 or more people in a household or a social group with recent physical contact develop symptoms.
- Recently, daytime temperature is frequently rising above 30 deg C [86 deg F]. People aged 65 or older and people with chronic medical condition are not only COVID-19 high-risk groups but also vulnerable to falling ill from heat waves. People belonging to such groups are advised to avoid going outside during daytime where there is high chance of exposure to other people and temperature is high.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 45 cases and no new deaths, compared with 50 cases and 2 deaths the previous day (9 Jun 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 65 consecutive days. Today's (10 Jun 2020) breakdown of cases: 40 cases were locally transmitted, and 5 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (20), Gyeonggi (15), and Incheon (5). Imported cases were 2 in Quarantine and 1 each in Seoul, Gyeonggi, and Incheon. Note that 14 provinces did not report any newly confirmed cases.

The detailed discussions of the clusters following the opening up of venues clearly illustrates the increased risk of transmission in enclosed, indoor venues with high density, including houses of worship. The clusters keep growing and expanding in geographic location. One wonders if other heightened measures might be implemented to slow down the transmission.

The impression (hasn't changed): Lifting of measures has been accompanied by increases in locally acquired infections through increasing clusters related to gatherings of people at employment (bringing it outside employment to contacts) and in houses of worship as well as bars and clubs. It just takes one super spreader in a crowded place to transmit and lead to a sizeable cluster.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 236 142 cases, including 34 167 deaths, up by 379 cases and 53 deaths in the past 24 hours. The previous day's (10 Jun 2020) 24-hour change was 202 cases and 71 deaths. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are still in decline. As it has been, the major increase in cases was in Lombardy, reporting 252 newly confirmed cases.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in Lombardy, the original epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Lazio, Piedmont, Tuscany, and Liguria (see tables at http://www.salute.gov.it/imgs/C_17_notizie_4881_0_file.pdf). These 6 provinces combined today (11 Jun 2020) account for 94.7% of reported newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy again reported the largest number of newly confirmed cases in the 24-hour period (252) and was the only province reporting more than 50 new cases. Also, 15 provinces reported fewer than 10 newly confirmed cases, and of these, 4 provinces reported no new cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

The top 5 provinces by cumulative case count remain unchanged and are Lombardy, followed by Piedmont, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Tuscany. The top 6 provinces by number of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours are Lombardy (252), followed by Piedmont (42), Emilia-Romagna (25), Lazio (20), and Liguria and Tuscany (10 each).

Italy is now 37 days post phase 2 initial opening up and 21 days post 2nd stage of phase 2 opening up.

[4] Iran: 177 938 total cases, 8506 deaths
Date: Thu 11 Jun 2020
Source: BBC [ edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/52959756


Iran has seen a rapid surge in the numbers of coronavirus cases in recent weeks, sparking fears it might be facing a 2nd wave of the pandemic.

Iran started to relax its lockdown in mid-April [2020], after the number of infections declined, so is it paying the price? New infections have been averaging more than 3000 a day in the 1st week of June, a 50% increase on the previous week.

The figure reached a high of 3574, on Thu 4 Jun [2020], before dropping slightly.
The previous highest figure was 3186, on 30 Mar [2020], during the initial outbreak, when Iran became one of the worst-affected countries outside China.

At that time, the Iranian authorities were criticised for their hesitation in closing down mosques and key religious sites in the city of Qom and for not moving quicker to restrict movement. Then, in April [2020], as the number of new cases dropped to below 1000 a day, Iran began to ease its lockdown restrictions:
- 20 Apr: Shopping malls and bazaars reopen, and travel resumes between different provinces
- 22 Apr: public parks and recreation areas reopen
- 12 May: government says all mosques can reopen
- 25 May: major Shia religious shrines reopen
- 26 May: restaurants, cafes, museums, and historical sites reopen
And city transport systems across Iran, as well as banks and offices, have been packed with people.

The epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the southwest, notably in Khuzestan province, an oil-rich region that borders Iraq.

There is clearly more social interaction with the easing of restrictions, but officials have suggested the surge in new cases could be down to more testing. President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases.

Iran's chief epidemiologist at the country's health ministry, Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya, explained: "The main reason for the rising numbers is that we have started identifying [infected people] who have no or mild symptoms."

It currently does one test for every 79 people, which is up from about one test for every 380 2 months ago. However, when you look at the proportion of these tests that are positive, there is a clear upward trend since the middle and end of May after it dropped sharply in April [2020]. On 29 May [2020], just under 11% of tests were positive, but by 6 Jun [2020], that figure had risen to over 14%.

Health officials have also pointed out the number of daily deaths recorded have remained below 100 since mid-April -2020]. It has been between 30 and 90 for the past month. But it would take several weeks after the initial rise in infections for an increase in recorded deaths to become apparent. And a report by the Iranian parliament's research centre, in April [2020], suggested the real death toll could be twice as high as the official number, which comprises deaths in hospitals only.

Health Minister Saeed Namaki said people were ignoring social-distancing rules. "People have become completely careless regarding this disease," he told the Iranian news agency. "If our people fail to respect the health protocols... we must prepare ourselves for the worst situation."

A health ministry poll last week suggested only:
- 40% of the population are keeping the social-distancing rules, down from 90% earlier in the outbreak; and
- 32% are following the rules on self-isolation, down from 86%.

President Hassan Rouhani has warned restrictions may have to be reintroduced if the outbreak worsens.

"To contain the virus, you need a lockdown," says Rana Rahimpour, "and in a lockdown, you need to be able to pay people."

[As of 10 Jun 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran is 177 938, including 8506 deaths, an increase of 2011 new cases and 81 deaths since 10 Jun 2020. Iran has started relaxing restrictions on a more widespread basis in the country. With the increasing daily case reports having surpassed the prior peak in late March-early April 2020, it is clear that there is now a 2nd wave, most likely due to too early lifting of restrictions. The key concern will be whether people begin travelling again within the country and may transport the virus from one zone to another.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 2 066 401, including 115 130 deaths, an increase from 2 045 549 cases and 114 148 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York City had a cumulative total of 205 405 as of 12:45 EDT (GMT-4) on 11 Jun 2020 (an increase of 829 newly confirmed cases since 10 Jun 2020, up from 323 on 9 Jun 2020) including 17 300 confirmed deaths (an increase of 97 deaths since 10 Jun 2020 and up from 34 deaths on 9 Jun 2020) and an additional 4693 probable deaths (https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data.page).

The top 10 states in terms of daily reported cases in descending order are California, Texas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, New York, Illinois, Alabama, and Maryland. A number of these states do not have many large urban centers, and the increase in case numbers is consistent with media reports that transmission is now occurring in smaller communities that had not had many cases during the past few months and many of these communities did not practice social distancing or use face masks to slow down transmission.

In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Michigan, and Maryland, the same 10 states as yesterday (10 Jun 2020) but in different order. A total of 38 states and entities have reported more than 10 000 cumulative cases each.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) when known.
