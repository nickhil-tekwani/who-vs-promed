New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location 1: Saint Laurent en Faucigny, Bonneville, Haute-Savoie, Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes
Started: 12 Oct 2021
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 219 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1 / 0
Affected population: dairy cattle, a first test on bulk milk gives a non-negative result. The herd is blocked and the milk is pasteurized until a _Brucella melitensis_ PCR test is carried out. The epidemiological investigation to understand the infection is underway. All the linked animals and herds are identified and placed under surveillance.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive, contact with wild species

Control measures at the event level
Domestic control measures to be applied: traceability; movement control inside the country ante- and post-mortem inspections; official destruction of animals products; disinfection; stamping out

Additional control measures different from event level: Surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone

[Brucellosis is the generic name used for the animal and human infections caused by several species of the genus_Brucella, mainly _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_. In animals, brucellosis is usually associated with late-term abortions in females and inflammation in the male reproductive tract.

Infection with Brucella in cattle is mainly caused by _B. abortus_. The disease is known as "Bovine brucellosis", "Contagious abortion" and "Bang's disease" (after the Danish veterinarian, who discovered _B. abortus_ as the cause of contagious abortion in cattle in 1887).

The main reservoir of _B. melitensis_ are sheep and goats, with the main symptom being abortions. Spillover into cattle from this reservoir is rather common in countries suffering endemic _B. melitensis_ in sheep and goats. _B. melitensis_ is not abortifacient in cattle but will infect the udders, followed by a massive discharge of the highly pathogenic bacteria in the milk and consequent human infections.

The source of the infection reported from cattle in Haute-Savoie is likely to be sought in wild fauna in the mountains, focusing on chamois [_Rupicapra rupicapra_]; please refer to 20120414.1101283 (human infection) and to 20121013.1340461 (reference to Mod PMB's commentary).

Brucella infection is readily transmissible to humans, causing acute febrile illness - 'undulant fever' - which may progress to a more chronic form and can also produce serious complications affecting the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. - Mods.AS & CRD
