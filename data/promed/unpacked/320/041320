[C] Update 38 - Situation in China 24 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsarchive/2003_04_24/en/>
The Chinese Ministry of Health has today reported an additional 125
probable SARS cases, including the first case from Anhui. The new figures
bring the cumulative number of reported probable cases in China to 2422. 21
provinces have now reported probable cases, with another 5 provinces
reporting suspected cases.
Of the 125 new cases, 24 occurred among health workers, including 17 in
Beijing. Altogether, China has reported 541 cases in health workers during
the course of its SARS outbreak, which began in mid-November 2002.
Beijing has reported the highest number of new cases (89), followed by
Guangdong (15), and Inner Mongolia (11). Beijing reported 4 new deaths,
bringing the cumulative number of SARS deaths in China to 110.
With a cumulative total of 1359 cases, Guangdong has the highest total
number of probable cases, followed by Beijing, with 774 probable cases.
The number of reported cases in Beijing is increasing on a daily basis, and
WHO is following the situation there closely. Data provided to date do not
allow determination of whether newly reported cases are old SARS cases only
now coming to light, or newly detected cases. Better interpretation of
reports and a more complete assessment of the underlying situation require
information on date of onset and location of cases. WHO has proposed to
Beijing city government officials a meeting (scheduled for 25 Apr 2003) of
WHO technical staff with Beijing disease experts in order to review
reporting procedures.
Yesterday Beijing authorities closed elementary and middle schools early as
an extension of the already planned national May Day holidays. Schools have
been asked to inform parents, teachers, and visitors about the symptoms of
SARS. People with symptoms have been asked not to visit schools. School
authorities have been asked to conduct close monitoring and to send home
any students, teachers, other staff, and visitors showing symptoms
suggestive of SARS.
In Shanghai, the WHO team of experts continued visits to hospitals and the
Shanghai Centre for Disease Control. The team has also examined procedures
for contact tracing. The team will present its findings tomorrow and return
to Beijing on Saturday [26 Apr 2003].
Update on cases and countries
As of today, a cumulative total of 4439 cases with 263 deaths have been
reported from 26 countries. This represents an increase of 158 new cases
and 12 deaths compared with yesterday. The deaths occurred in Canada (2),
China (4), Hong Kong SAR (4), and Singapore (2). Bulgaria reported its
first case today.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 24 Apr 2003
--------------------------------------------------
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 24 Apr 2003, there are an additional 30 patients confirmed to
have atypical pneumonia following admission to public hospitals earlier.
They include 3 health care workers (one from Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole
Hospital, one from St Teresa's Hospital, and one from Baptist Hospital).
The remaining 27 are other patients and contacts of patients with atypical
pneumonia.
A total of 567 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 45 were discharged today.
There are also 135 recovering patients who are in convalescence and
preparation for discharge. 108 patients are receiving treatment in
intensive care units.
4 male patients died in Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital (AHNH),
Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH), Tuen Mun Hospital (TMH), and Tai Po
Hospital (TPH). This brought to 109 the total number of deaths relating to
atypical pneumonia. The deceased are aged from 39 to 87 and all have a
history of chronic disease.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases / total no. discharged patients / total no. deaths*
Health care workers of hospitals/clinics and medical students: 338 / 128 / ?
Patients, family members & visitors: 1150 / 439 / ?
Total: 1488 ** / 567 / 109
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of chronic
diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage
of infection.
** There are 135 recovering patients in convalescence.

Update: SARS -- United States, 2003 -- CDC continues to work with WHO and
other partners
-----------------------------------
This report updates information on reported SARS cases worldwide and among
US residents and summarizes information on one additional case with
laboratory evidence of infection with the SARS-associated coronavirus
(SARS-CoV).
During 1 Nov 2002--23 Apr 2003, a total of 4288 SARS cases were reported to
WHO from 25 countries, including the United States; 251 deaths
(case-fatality proportion: 5.8 per cent) have been reported (1). In the US
as of 23 Apr 2003, a total of 245 SARS cases were reported to CDC from 37
states. Of these, 39 (16 per cent) had illnesses characterized by the
presence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome consistent
with the interim US surveillance case definition for probable SARS (2). The
remaining 206 (84 per cent) had fever and respiratory symptoms. Of the 39
probable SARS patients, 37 (94 per cent) had traveled to mainland China,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Hanoi, or Toronto; one (3 per cent) was a health care
worker (HCW) who provided care to a SARS patient, and one (3 per cent) was
a household contact of a SARS patient. 27 (69 per cent) of the probable
SARS patients were hospitalized, and one (3 per cent) required mechanical
ventilation.
As of 23 Apr 2003, of the 245 reported SARS cases, 45 (18 per cent) have
diagnostic SARS-CoV laboratory findings (positive findings based on
detection of antibody to SARS-CoV in serum; evidence of virus in
respiratory specimens by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction
analysis; or negative findings based on absence of antibody to SARS-CoV in
convalescent serum obtained >21 days after symptom onset). 39 reported
cases (32 suspect and 7 probable based on SARS case definition) tested
negative for SARS-CoV; 6 have been identified with laboratory-confirmed
SARS-CoV infection, all of which were classified as probable cases. 5 of
these 6 patients were described previously (3). Clinical information for
the one additional patient and the related public health investigation and
actions are summarized below.
Pennsylvania
On 3 Apr 2003, a man aged 52 years developed symptoms including fatigue,
myalgia, headache, chills, and sweating. The patient had diarrhea on 5 Apr
2003 and sought care at the emergency department (ED) of hospital A on 6
Apr 2003. A temperature of 100.7 F (38.2 C) was recorded, but diagnostic
testing was not performed, and he was discharged with a diagnosis of acute
viral syndrome. By 10 Apr 2003, despite initiation of oral amoxicillin, his
symptoms progressed to include a dry cough, prompting him to visit his
primary-care provider. He had no fever or abnormal findings on physical
examination. A chest radiograph was normal. On 14 Apr 2003, the patient
went to the ED of hospital B with dehydration, cough, and severe shortness
of breath. Bilateral interstitial infiltrates were present on chest
radiograph. In the ED, he was identified as a suspect SARS patient about
2.5 hours after arrival. He was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis
of atypical pneumonia and possible SARS, and was placed in an isolation
room with negative pressure. Serum samples collected on 15 Apr 2003 (day 12
of illness) demonstrated SARS-CoV antibodies. The patient received
supportive care and antibiotic treatment (levofloxacin for pneumonia and
metronidazole for diarrhea associated with laboratory-confirmed
_Clostridium difficile_). By 17 Apr 2003, the patient's shortness of breath
improved considerably, and he was discharged on 21 Apr 2003.
The patient had traveled to Toronto, Canada, for a religious retreat during
29--30 Mar 2003; the event has been linked to subsequent SARS cases among
the attendees (4). On 17 Apr 2003, a CDC team traveled to Pennsylvania to
assist the Pennsylvania Department of Health in its investigation of this
patient and his contacts. 23 HCWs (from hospitals A and B, the physician's
office, and the outpatient laboratory) who had contact with the patient
before he was isolated in the hospital were evaluated for their types and
durations of contact with the patient, their use of personal protective
equipment, and their subsequent health. 6 HCWs with unprotected, close
contact were furloughed for 10 days after exposure and advised to monitor
their temperatures twice daily and to report fever and respiratory symptoms
to the hospital's occupational health clinic. The 6 furloughed HCWs
included 3 people from hospital B exposed on 10 Apr 2003 and 3 people from
hospital B exposed on 14 Apr 2003. While furloughed, 2 HCWs had mild
symptoms (sore throat, rhinorrhea, mild cough, or headache), which resolved
without treatment. 2 additional HCWs (one each from hospital B and the
outpatient laboratory) who had mild respiratory symptoms subsequently were
furloughed from work, although neither had fever >100.4 F (>38.0 C) or
evidence of SARS on clinical evaluation. After the man was identified as a
potential SARS patient, HCWs in hospital B used fit-tested N95 respirators
and wore gowns and gloves but did not wear eye protection.
The patient had close contact with 4 family members before SARS was
diagnosed. Beginning 9 Apr 2003, the patient and his family members
reported intermittently wearing surgical masks during close contact. One
family member reported illness consistent with the case definition for
suspect SARS, but the symptoms began before contact with the index patient;
this family member's illness has resolved and people who had contact with
this family member are being monitored. Among 6 additional non-family
contacts, one reported new respiratory symptoms since exposure, but
continues to be without fever or other symptoms of SARS. The investigation
is ongoing and SARS-CoV testing of specimens from all contacts is under way.
MMWR Editorial Note:
The majority of suspect and probable cases of SARS in the United States
continue to be travel-associated, with only limited secondary spread to
contacts such as family members and HCWs. Toronto has been added to the
list of areas with suspected or documented community transmission of SARS
included in the interim US SARS case definition (2). SARS transmission in
Toronto has been limited to a small number of hospitals, households, and
specific community settings. In particular, cases of SARS have been
documented among some members of a religious community who attended a large
gathering in Toronto in late March [2003]; some of these people infected
members of their households and other close contacts (4). In response to
these reports, CDC recommended that US travelers to Toronto observe
precautions to safeguard their health, including avoidance of places in
which SARS is most likely to be transmitted (such as Toronto health care
facilities) (5). The Pennsylvania resident who attended this religious
meeting is the only reported US patient with SARS associated with travel to
Toronto. The availability of diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV is critical to
the more precise characterization of the epidemiology and clinical spectrum
of the SARS epidemic, both worldwide and in the US. Many US patients,
particularly those with milder clinical illness, have tested negative for
SARS-CoV, reflecting the low specificity of the current case definition,
which captures people with respiratory infections caused by other
infectious agents, and underscoring the importance of obtaining
convalescent serum samples to make a final determination about infection
with SARS-CoV. CDC is planning to update its interim surveillance case
definition for SARS to include laboratory criteria in addition to the
clinical and epidemiologic criteria.
Careful attention to infection control precautions, both in home and health
care settings, remains critical to containment of SARS. Symptomatic people
should use infection control precautions to minimize the potential for
transmission and should seek health care evaluation (6). Patients should
inform health care providers about the symptoms in advance so arrangements
can be made, if necessary, to prevent potential transmission to others in
the health care setting. Patients in ambulatory settings should be screened
promptly for fever, respiratory symptoms, recent travel, and close contact
with SARS patients (7). The investigations summarized in this report
suggest that, although both patients and health care providers are aware of
appropriate infection control precautions, additional efforts are needed to
ensure that recommended precautions are instituted immediately when SARS is
suspected and that such precautions are used consistently and correctly
thereafter.

[As of 24 Apr 2003 WHO has reported a cumulative total of 4439 probable
cases and 158 deaths attributable to SARS. In today's update [1][C] there
is more information about the outbreak in China, including the fact that
probable cases of SARS have now been reported from 21 provinces, with
suspected cases reported from an additional 5 provinces. From available
data, a cumulative total of 2422 probable cases of SARS have been reported
by China, of which 541 cases (22 per cent) were in health care workers.
Worldwide, cases have been reported in 26 countries. We look forward to
seeing more detailed epidemiological data on the outbreak in China, by
province, when these data become available.
The information provided in CDC's MMWR article [4][B] with results of
current laboratory testing is curious. According to this article, of the
245 reported combined suspected and probable cases, 45 (18 per cent) had
positive laboratory tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus; 39 of the
245 (15.9 per cent) had negative results, 32 suspected and 7 probable cases
(7 out of 37 probable cases or 19 per cent) were negative for the SARS
associated coronavirus), and 6 of the probable cases (16 per cent) were
reported to have positive tests for the SARS-associated coronavirus. While
these are small numbers, one wonders whether the discussion that "CDC is
planning to update its interim surveillance case definition for SARS to
include laboratory criteria in addition to the clinical and epidemiologic
criteria" might not be premature. Of note, Dr Frank Plummer of the Canadian
National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg is quoted in a NY Times
article today: "Dr Plummer's team in Winnipeg has tested about 3000
specimens from 95 probable and 90 suspect cases in Canada and Asia. His
team identified the SARS virus in about 40 per cent of the probable cases
and 35 per cent of the suspect cases. He said he was surprised to find the
virus in about 20 per cent of an additional 250 people who were not
suspected of having SARS but who were tested because they had come to
Canada from affected areas in Asia or who had mild symptoms not thought to
be SARS. Although the 250 were not randomly chosen as scientific controls,
Dr Plummer said he was still surprised at the number who tested positive."
It appears the verdict is not yet in on the sensitivity and specificity of
currently available tests, or whether the SARS-associated coronavirus is
the "full answer". <http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/24/science/24INFE.html>.
We await further information on this issue. - Mod.MPP]
