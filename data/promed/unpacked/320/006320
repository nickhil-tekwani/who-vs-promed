From data and information provided by Dr. Sam Holland, SD State
Veterinarian, Pierre, SD:
The outbreak began in a 660-head cattle and bison herd with deaths first
noted on 18 Jul; confirmed on 20 Jul 2005. Since then 155 head have died.
"These were buffalo in some rough country, in fact they never were able to
gather the entire herd of 500-600 cows and calves. About 30 pair refused to
be gathered. They were losing 20-40 head per day when they gathered and
worked them. The owner called this morning [29 Jul 2005] and after 6 days
all carcasses have been burned and buried and one trench left over for the
stragglers. They will re-gather the buffalo and revaccinate early next week.
The owner was thankful that he did treat and vaccinate as he said it 'shut
the dying off over nite.' Very difficult and stressful with the extremely
high temperatures, very rough country with canyons and breaks into the
river bottom, and corralling buffalo is not easy, especially in hot weather.
Since then there have been 3 more herds (50 to 400 head) in Sully confirmed
(first called in on 26-27 Jul 2005) and one is awaiting confirmation; 3
herds in Potter county with presumptive diagnoses reported on 27 Jul
awaiting confirmation; 2 in Marshall county, 26 Jul, with one confirmed;
one confirmed outbreak in Brown county, first reported 26 Jul; and one
presumptive outbreak in Hyde county reported today.
We had 3 ranchers call 29 Jul 2005 saying they had vaccinated yesterday and
the day before without simultaneously treating with antibiotics and had
lost 2-10 cows overnight. One reported he vaccinated yesterday, had lost a
cow a few days back and didn't attribute it to anthrax. This morning he had
8 dead and 2 were down and in the throes of death while we spoke."

[With thanks to Sam Holland for providing all this information. The owner
of the Sully bison ranch is to be highly commended for his efforts at
treating and then burning and burying such a large number in such a short
time. No mean feat. - Mod.MHJ]
