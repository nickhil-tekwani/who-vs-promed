Blue-ear pig disease still in 14 Chinese counties
-------------------------------------------------
According to China's chief veterinary officer, Jia Youling, blue-ear
pig disease, which is partly responsible for the current pork
shortage, is still present in 14 Chinese counties. Youling said at a
press conference that the Ministry of Agriculture was increasing
measures to bring the epidemic under control.
He has said that since the start of 2007, the disease had plagued 286
Chinese counties and infected 280 000 pigs, of which more than 70 000
died. The ministry administered 510 million millilitres of vaccines
to immunise over 200 million pigs.
Known as Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome [PRRS], it has
cut the provision of live pigs and caused pork price hikes. Pork
price hikes and hikes of other food products pushed the country's
consumer price index to 6.5 percent during August [2007], after it
hit a 10-year high of 5.6 percent in July [2007].
Yin Chengjie, Vice Agriculture Minister said the pork price is
unlikely to increase drastically in the long run as the nation came
with a series of measures to encourage farmers to raise pigs. The
vice minister added that farmers could presently make 300 to 400 yuan
(Euro 28.8 - 38.4) [USD 53.17] from raising a pig, which would help
rekindle the enthusiasm of farmers who suffered losses from raising
pigs in 2006.
According to latest figures from the Ministry of Commerce, pork
prices in China fell for 4 consecutive weeks, until 2 Sep 2007, amid
government efforts to increase supply.
