While COVID-19 in 2021 was again the 3rd leading cause of death in the US, racial and ethnic disparities narrowed from the year before [2020], provisional CDC data indicated.

Overall, 65.2% of the COVID-19 deaths in 2021 were among white individuals, 16.5% were among Hispanic individuals, and 13.3% were among Black individuals. In 2020 these proportions were 59.6%, 18.6%, and 16.1%, respectively, reported Benedict Truman, MD, of the CDC and COVID-19 Emergency Response Team, and colleagues in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) [http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7117e2].

From 2020 to 2021, respectively, a number of racial and ethnic groups saw decreases in COVID-19-related age-adjusted death rates (AADRs):
- Hispanic: 155.5 vs 153.7 per 100 000
- Black/African American: 142.0 vs 133.4
- Asian: 63.1 vs 61.9

However, AADRs from 2020-2021 were higher among white individuals (66.6-90.0 per 100 000), American Indian/Alaska Native persons (175.9-182.5), and non-Hispanic Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander individuals (112.4-189.2).

Thus, although the slew of public health strategies that had been implemented to address racial and ethnic disparities in COVID seem to have paid off -- by helping local communities with COVID surveillance, isolation, contact tracing, mobile diagnostic testing, vaccination, and outpatient treatment, for example -- the researchers emphasized that disparities still persist.

Indeed, a separate paper, published in the same issue of MMWR, found both COVID-specific and total death rates in 2021 were highest among individuals 85 and older, as well as males and non-Hispanic American Indian, Alaska Native, and Black people [http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7117e1]. Farida Ahmad, MPH, of the CDC, and colleagues reported that COVID death rates in 2021 trailed only heart disease, responsible for 693 000 deaths, and cancer, which took roughly 605 000 lives. COVID-19 stayed the 3rd leading cause of death for the 2nd year in a row, according to provisional mortality data collected from death certificates.

Behind the top 3 causes of death were unintentional injuries, stroke, chronic lower respiratory diseases, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, kidney disease, and suicide. Unintentional injuries was a category largely driven by drug overdose deaths, which led to a disproportionate increase in the deaths among younger people.

According to the CDC's National Vital Statistics System, roughly 75 000 more people died from COVID in 2021 versus 2020. For deaths that listed COVID-19 as the sole cause or a contributing cause, this number increased from 384 536 in 2020 to 460 513 in 2021.

In total, the AADR increased by 0.7% from 2020 to 2021, jumping from 3 383 729 to 3 458 697 total deaths. The death rate peaked during the 2nd half of January and during the beginning half of September [2021].

Both studies from Truman and Ahmad's groups relied on provisional mortality data for the year 2021.

"Provisional death estimates can give researchers and policymakers an early projection of shifts in mortality trends and provide actionable information sooner than do the final mortality data, which are released approximately 11 months after the end of the data year," Ahmad and colleagues wrote, noting that these numbers can now help guide public health policies and interventions to help curb the rising death rate.

[2] US and China (Shanghai): seroprevalence and cases
Date: Tue 26 Apr 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/04/cdc-58-americans-have-had-covid-19


New COVID-19 seroprevalence data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that the omicron surge infected a huge swath of Americans, with overall seroprevalence rising from 33.5% in December of 2021 to 57.7% in February 2022.

The data, which reflect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the blood, indicating a previous infection, were published today [26 Apr 2022] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7117e3].

The increase was seen most dramatically in children. In kids ages 0-11, seroprevalence jumped from 44.2% to 75.2%, and in kids 12-17, it rose from 45.6% to 74.2%.

"As of February 2022, approximately 75% of children and adolescents had serologic evidence of previous infection with SARS-CoV-2, with approximately 1/3 becoming newly seropositive since December 2021," the CDC and other US authors of the report said.

Seroprevalence studies can help detect infections that were asymptomatic or unreported. The antibodies detected are those produced only by natural infection and not from vaccines.

The presence of antibodies to a previous infection should not be interpreted as protection from future infections, the authors warned. Instead, vaccination is the safest way to increase protection from future infections, the authors said today [26 Apr 2022] at a press briefing.

"Those who have detectable antibody from prior infection, we still continue to encourage them to get vaccinated," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky, MD, MPH, said today [26 Apr 2022] during a press briefing. "We don't know when that infection was. We don't know whether that protection has waned."

The CDC COVID Data Tracker shows that 66.1% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 77.5% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 45.6% of those eligible have received their 1st booster dose [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total].

Data from health departments in all 50 states show that millions of COVID-19 vaccine doses have either gone to waste, remain unused, or will expire in the coming weeks and months, ABC News reports [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/millions-covid-19-shots-set-waste-vaccine-rollout/story?id=84111412].

During the briefing Walensky gave an overview on pandemic numbers. "Overall, we have some mixed trends," she said. The 7-day average of deaths is trending downwards, to 300 per day. Hospital admissions stand at 1500 per day: low but trending upward for the 2nd week in a row. Daily case counts average 44 000 per day, an increase of 25% in the past week.

During a White House briefing today [26 Apr 2022], coordinator of the COVID-19 Response Ashish Jha, MD, pushed for a broader use of Paxlovid, a therapeutic made by Pfizer that can treat COVID-19 infections in those at risk for severe complications. Jha spoke hours after news broke that Vice President Kamala Harris had tested positive for the virus but was asymptomatic.

"The goal of our policy is to make sure people don't get seriously ill, make sure they're vaccinated and boosted, and make sure we have therapeutics," Jha said. "If you get COVID, you should see a provider and make the assessment. A lot more people are eligible."

Jha said the Biden administration was opening up a federal pharmacy channel, meaning pharmacies could order the pills directly from the government in the next several weeks. "Paxlovid will be widely available everywhere in America," he said.

A total of 1.4 billion vaccine doses have been distributed to 145 countries through COVAX, according to a new report on the action of the ACT Accelerator (Access to COVID-19 Tools) from the World Health Organization (WHO).

The Accelerator was created to equitably deliver vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics to low- and middle-income countries. In addition to the 1.4 billion vaccine doses, the Accelerator has also aided in building the sequencing capacity in South Africa that first detected the omicron variant and helped negotiate supplemental oxygen prices in 120 countries.

In a forward on the report, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, MD, writes, "WHO's goal to vaccinate 70% of the population of every country remains essential for bringing the pandemic under control. While most high- and upper-middle-income countries have surpassed that target, today, 1.8 billion people in low- and low-and-middle-income settings have yet to receive their first dose."

In other global developments, Beijing has extended mass testing to 10 more districts and an economic area. Roughly 75% of the 22 million citizens of that city have been tested in an effort to avoid a Shanghai-like lockdown.

The latest update from China notes 17 724 new local cases, of which 1908 are asymptomatic. Of the asymptomatic cases, 96% are from Shanghai, and, of the symptomatic cases, 87% are from Shanghai. Beijing has 32 more asymptomatic cases and one more symptomatic case [http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2022-04/26/c_85931.htm]. China also has 52 more deaths, all in Shanghai.

[A] 4th dose vaccine protection

Israelis aged 60 and older given a 4th dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine amid the Omicron surge had a 64% lower risk of hospitalization and 78% lower risk of death than those who received 3 doses, suggests an observational study [see citation below] published yesterday [25 Apr 2022] in Nature Medicine.

Clalit Health Services researchers compared the outcomes of 328 597 patients who received a 4th COVID-19 vaccine dose with those of 234 868 patients who received 3 doses. Israelis 60 and older who had received a 3rd dose at least 4 months before became eligible for a 4th dose on 3 Jan 2022, and study follow-up began one week later. Average patient age was 73.0 years, and 53% were women.

In the 4th-dose group, 270 patients were hospitalized, compared with 550 in the 3-dose group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.31-0.43). Ninety-two 4th-dose patients died, as did 232 3rd-dose recipients (adjusted HR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.17-0.28).
Risk factors for death included age 70-79 (HR, 2.24) and 80-100 (HR, 9.95), male sex (HR, 1.59), chronic heart failure (HR, 4.11), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (HR, 1.82), diabetes (HR, 2.06), and stroke (HR, 1.84).

Risk factors for hospitalization included age 70-79 (HR, 1.82) and 80-100 (HR, 4.04), male sex (HR, 1.53), chronic heart failure (HR, 2.17), chronic kidney failure (HR, 2.27), COPD (HR, 2.24), diabetes (HR, 1.43), high blood pressure (HR, 1.39), ischemic heart disease (HR, 1.21), and stroke (HR, 1.43).

"Although this study is observational in nature, we believe that its substantial findings and the observed potential for avoiding the most severe COVID-19 outcomes could assist decision-makers in assessing the benefit of providing the 2nd booster to targeted populations," the researchers wrote. "Studies with long-term follow-up to determine the durability of the 2nd-booster effectiveness against severe disease and safety are warranted."

[B] Hospitalized with omicron

Though they need hospital care much less often, patients hospitalized with the omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant require similar levels of respiratory support and intensive care unit (ICU) treatment as those with the delta variant, according to a Johns Hopkins study published in the May [2022] issue of eBioMedicine.

The study [see citation above] involved 1119 omicron and 908 delta patients diagnosed from 22 Nov-31 Dec 2021 in the Washington, DC, area. The researchers found that the omicron patients were 67% less likely to require hospitalization, 62% less likely to need ICU care, and 74% less likely to die than their delta-infected counterparts.

Once in the hospital, however, patients with omicron had a similar need for supplemental oxygen and ICU care as hospitalized delta patients. Among omicron patients, 67.6% required supplemental oxygen, and 17.6% were taken to an ICU. For delta, 73% needed supplemental oxygen, and 25.4% required ICU-level care.

The researchers found no significant differences in viral loads between the 2 groups, regardless of vaccination status.

"It's true that patients with omicron were significantly less likely to be admitted to the hospital than patients with delta," said senior author Heba Mostafa, MBBCh, PhD, in a Johns Hopkins news release [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/950744]. "But omicron patients who did need hospitalization faced a risk of severe disease comparable to those hospitalized with delta. For many people, it is not a mild infection at all."

[In the past 24 hours, 12 countries including Germany (135 699), France (97 498), South Korea (76 761), the USA (55 853), Spain (47 421), Australia (42 289), Italy (29 984), Switzerland (22 622), Brazil (22 142), Belgium (20 322), the UK (16 611), and Thailand (14 887) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 3403 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 24 Apr 2022 to late 25 Apr 2022). A total of 40 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 24 of the 40 countries are from the European region, 5 are from the Americas region, 2 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, and none are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 4.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 10.7%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 31.6% increase in daily reported cases and 8.5% decrease in reported deaths. An overall global trend of decreasing cases (US has shown an increasing-cases trend over the last few days) and reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 0.73 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 510.83 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.24 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
