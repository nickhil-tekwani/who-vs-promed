The current Hendra outbreak in Queensland and northern NSW maintains
the puzzle of why horses further south have not been infected despite
the presence of serologically positive fruit bats all the way to
Victoria.

Large populations of bats and horses in close proximity exist all the
way down the east coast of Australia.

To my mind there must be one or several environmental factors
influencing this situation. Perhaps an as yet unidentified vector,
such as ticks or biting flies, or midges, is involved or perhaps
climatic conditions may come to bear. Queensland and northern NSW are
tropical/sub-tropical climates whilst further south the climate is
temperate.

Nipah virus outbreaks seem to follow the same climatic distribution.
Stephen Barker (University of Queensland) proposed a possible scenario
for tick-bat horse interaction that bears further investigation
(Medical Hypotheses 2003; 60(4): 481-3; abstract available at
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12615503).

One avenue of investigation would be to establish an east coast
surveillance of _Pteropus_ sp, equine, canine, and feline Hendra
serology as well as a mapping of tick populations and their hosts in
order to detect any overlap and hence potential for transmission.

Detection of virus in ticks or other vectors would be illuminating. If
documented, this would raise the possibility of other native or
domestic mammalian or marsupial species being infected with Hendra
virus.

The possibility of latent carrier status in domestic animals is also
of concern and should perhaps be investigated. Endemic infection of
feral dogs, foxes, cats, etc would be another serious concern. All in
all this virus is a fascinating opportunity to study an emerging
infectious disease and the protean factors that facilitate these
occurrences and to also provide us with measures to prevent or
mitigate such outbreaks.
