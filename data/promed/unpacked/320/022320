Stripe rust threat to wheat worse than predicted
------------------------------------------------
An epidemic caused by a new strain of wheat fungus could cause
billions of dollars in crop losses across North Africa, the Middle
East, and Central Asia. The wheat stripe rust epidemic is far worse
than predicted, scientists have found. "Some farmers will suffer 30-60
percent yield loss. In the worst cases, yield loss is 100 percent,"
said Maarten Van Ginkel, International Center for Agricultural
Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA).

Key cereal production regions are affected and in some countries, like
Syria, up to 80 percent of fields are affected. "Urgent action is
needed to protect wheat crops on some 50 million hectares [124 million
acres]," Mahmoud Solh, director general of ICARDA, said. The areas
most affected by the stripe rust include Iran, Iraq, Morocco, and
Syria. Afghanistan, Algeria, and Tunisia are also affected.

The pathogen race able to overcome a major wheat resistance gene first
emerged in 2002 in South Asia but unfavourable weather conditions
limited its spread until 2009, when it started re-appearing. Van
Ginkel said his team is documenting and analysing the impact of the
recent outbreaks.

New resistant wheat varieties are already available. But the process
of releasing these varieties and distributing enough seeds must be
accelerated. Governments will have to take appropriate measures, such
as planting high-yielding, resistant varieties and continually
monitoring affected areas, to prevent new outbreaks in 2011, Solh
said. "ICARDA has always stressed the need to remain vigilant against
stripe rust."

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. It causes yellow
leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100
percent. The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale,
and a number of wild grasses. Spores are wind dispersed in several
cycles during the cropping season, and the fungus survives on living
host plants generating a "green bridge" between seasons. Disease
management includes the use of resistant varieties, fungicide
applications, and control of volunteer crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence have been reported in
recent years from Europe, North America, Australia, and India and are
also suspected to emerge in China. Monitoring programmes are important
to recognise these emerging new strains. Depending on the
susceptibility of preferred cereal varieties grown in different
countries, it can be expected that new rust strains will differ in
national or regional significance.
