The number of measles cases in Wales continues to rise
------------------------------------------------------
A total of 14 cases of the highly contagious disease linked to 2 schools in
Llandudno, Conwy, have now been confirmed. There are now also 31 suspected
cases, says the National Public Health Service for Wales (NPHS).

They are not said to be linked to an outbreak in West Wales earlier this
month [April 2009]. The NPHS is urging parents to ensure their children
have received their vaccinations.
