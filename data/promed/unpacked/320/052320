We were very thankful for help received in the period of a large outbreak
of aseptic meningitis in the Republic of Belarus in 1997 caused by ECHO-30.
During this outbreak we received experience and elaborated approaches to
sanitary-virologic and epidemiologic investigations. We managed to
determine that our outbreaks were water-borne. Both underground
water-intakes and river-intakes were contaminated by viruses. Since hard
[disinfection regimens of drinking water had been undertaken, the disease
incidence decreased.
ProMED-mail data concerning a large epidemic of enterovirus infections in
Taiwan inform about airborne transmission. It will be interesting to know
if drinking water were examined with regard to virus pollution.
If needed, we could provide some practical support with our specialists.
