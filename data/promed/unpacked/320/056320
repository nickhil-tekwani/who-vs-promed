It has been found in loons in the upper Great Lakes region in 1995. This may be found on page 17 of this US Fish and Wildlife Conservation publication, which cites a report co-authored by Pokras: http://www.briloon.org/uploads/BRI_Documents/Loon_Center/RCF/USFWS_Conservation_Plan_92913-1.pdf.

["Species of the apicomplexans Haemoproteus, Plasmodium, and Leucocytozoon comprise a diverse group of vector-transmitted parasites that infect red blood cells (in the case of Leucocytozoon spp., also white blood cells) and other organs within their vertebrate hosts (Atkinson and Van Riper, 1991; Valkiunas, 1993). Species of these parasite genera share several characters with human malaria parasites, and all 3 (but most often only Plasmodium spp.) are referred to as avian malaria." Extracted from: A New Pcr Assay For Simultaneous Studies Of Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium, And Haemoproteus From Avian Blood: by Olof Hellgren, Jonas Waldenstrom, and Staffan Bensch. Pub: 797 J. Parasitol., 90(4), 2004, pp. 797-802 q American Society of Parasitologists 2004.

Please note, the pages listed above are rather long and are more easily accessed via the web. Please note that on the 2nd one, it is on the top half of page 17.

Finding the parasite in a loon is apparently not unusual, but it seems to have excited the folks in Maine. And, apparently, from reading some of these sites and other publications, this parasite has been found in loons before, but it seems to be the 1st time it has been found in Maine. Perhaps if it had been looked for years ago, it may well have been found earlier. Or if a bird had been found in a more timely fashion, then it could have been found earlier. - Mod.TG
