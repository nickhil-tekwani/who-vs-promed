New measures against viruses in Murcian vegetables
--------------------------------------------------
The Minister of Agriculture and Water [MAW], Antonio Cerda, demanded producers collaborate to implement the necessary preventive measures to stop new virus diseases spreading in vegetables. He focused on the emergence of a new virus transmitted by a small white fly, known as the New Delhi virus, which affects mainly zucchini and squash in the Region of Murcia. The most worrisome risk is the possible infection of other crops such as capsicum and tomatoes, which has not happened so far.

Raising awareness among producers is required in order to eliminate possible virus sources, [such as] infected plants. MAW is currently processing an order to make a series of measures obligatory. Currently, researchers and different seed companies are working to get to know the New Delhi virus and provide resistant varieties.

[Known virus species in the tomato leaf curl and tomato yellow leaf curl clades of genus _Begomovirus_ cause similar diseases on solanaceous crops and can lead to considerable yield losses. Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes) and many can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed transmitted. Begomovirus control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control, and elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (ToLCNDV) has been reported to cause severe yield losses on tomato and watermelon crops in the Indian subcontinent. It has a wider host range than _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_, which has previously been present in Spain (see for example, ProMED-mail post 20100923.3444). ToLCNDV was apparently discovered in Murcia in late July 2013 (see links below), but the source of the incursion is unknown. National producers hope that the strain introduced to Spain is specific to cucurbits and will not spread to crops in other families as well.
