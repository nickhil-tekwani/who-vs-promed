More Than 400 Infected in Ugandan Ebola Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: The number of people infected with Ebola virus passed 400 on Fri 8
Dec 2000, with 160 of those victims dying from the highly [lethal disease,
said Dr. Alex Opio, Assistant Director of the National Disease Control Center.
In the last 3 days, 2 people have died in the northern town of Gulu, while
2 others died in Masindi, 125 miles northwest of Kampala. Opio said that
during the same period 7 new cases had been identified in Gulu, the
epicenter of the outbreak. So far the disease has been confined to Gulu,
Masindi and Mbarara districts.
With the rate of new cases dwindling, Ugandan officials have no plans to
restrict travel during the busy Christmas season because there is little
chance at this stage of the outbreak worsening.
The outbreak has taken a staggering toll on health workers in Gulu. "So far
26 health workers have been affected by the virus," Opio said. "The 13 who
have died in Gulu include 11 nurses, one doctor and a clinical officer. [In
addition 2 nurses and one doctor are down with the disease."
