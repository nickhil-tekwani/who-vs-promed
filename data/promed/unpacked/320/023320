Almost 80 000 out of 123 645 hectares of the winter-spring rice crop
in the Mekong Delta has contracted leaf diseases caused by brown
planthopper _Nilaparvata lugens_, a major pest, and this threatens
Vietnam's food security, the agriculture ministry has warned.
The provinces of Long An, Tien Giang, Tra Vinh and Vinh Long are
hardest hit. Long An and Tien Giang have announced an epidemic, Vinh
Long is about to pronounce, while 14 000 hectares of ailing rice in
Tra Vinh have embarrassed local officials, said Mr. Diep Kinh Tan,
deputy agriculture minister.
Even worse, there are fears the insects may spread quickly. Another
problem is in many localities, farmers refuse to destroy ill paddy
fields despite of an epidemic affecting 40-50 percent of the total area.
The agriculture ministry has warned an extreme alert, and ministry
officials are working in all the 13 Mekong Delta provinces to fight
against the epidemic.
Experts warn that the country's food security will be harmed if the
epidemic is not curbed soon.
Mr. Tan asserted that paddy fields with a high epidemic rate must be destroyed.
According to the agriculture ministry, it will take at least 5-7
years more to produce proper insect-resistance rice seeds. The
current seeds can only resist the insects to an acceptable extent.
Prices of such seeds are increasing in the delta, but there is a
shortage of supply. Therefore, many farmers have selected
non-insect-resistance seeds.
A fact in the delta, Vietnam's biggest rice-growing region, is that
the pests have caused an epidemic every 10 years or so.

The Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development sent an urgent
message to provincial authorities in the Mekong Delta late last
weekend, urging them to step up efforts against pest infestation and
the resulting rice disease.
The message said provincial authorities must control the population
of brown plant hopper pests during the Autumn-winter, the 10th-month
and the winter-spring rice crops.
Authorities must spray fields with agro-chemicals anytime 3 or more
brown insects are found on one rice plant.
The message said that mass insect-fighting campaigns must be held if
the insects appear on vast rice cultivation areas. Under these
campaigns, the provincial authorities must provide insecticide to
farmers and any fields must be destroyed if they are infected by over
10 percent of the ragged stunt rice disease.
Farmers are required to conduct preventive sanitation for rice fields
before the 2006-2007 winter-spring crop begins and the provincial
authority will give schedule for rice sowing. The Ministry's
Cultivation Department also asked farmers not to use rice strains
that have been affected by brown insects.
Ho Chi Minh City launched a one-month campaign to prevent the brown
plant hoppers and the resulting ragged stunt rice disease from
spreading to rice fields in HCM City's suburban district of Binh
Chanh on Saturday morning.
The deputy chairman of HCM City People's Committee, Nguyen Thanh Tai,
said the ragged stunt rice disease has affected 5666 hectares of land
in Binh Chanh (more than 4000 hectares), Binh Tan, Hoc Mon, Nha Be
and Can Gio suburban districts.
The affected area accounts for 29 percent of the expected 10th-month
rice crop in the city.
Tai urged leaders of relevant agencies and districts to give guidance
to implement the measures to combat the brown planthoppers and rice disease.
He also asked the leaders of Cu Chi, Hoc Mon and District 9 to
re-structure the farming system in each district beginning with the
2006-2007 winter-summer crop.
After the launch, some 700 young people from the Police Academy, the
Agriculture School and the HCM City Department of Agriculture and
Rural Development went to Tan Nhut Commune in Binh Chanh District to
help farmers destroy 510 hectares of rice fields affected with the
rugged stunt rice disease.

Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung sent an urgent message on Thursday
urging local authorities to curb pest infestation and the resulting
rice disease, currently destroying rice fields in southern and
central Viet Nam.
He ordered that the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
promptly control the brown planthopper population, an insect family
that eats rice plants, leaving susceptible fields ragged with rice disease.
The ministry must help local farmers destroy rice areas heavily
plagued by brown planthoppers to stop the epidemic from spreading to
surrounding fields, he said.
Other measures involve helping farmers to cultivate rice plants on
schedule, restructuring rice fields to grow other subsidiary food
crops and transplanting pest resistant, high quality rice strains to
mitigate the losses.
The Southern Plant Protection Department has also proposed that local
agricultural officials provide financial assistance to farmers who
had been forced to destroy their rice fields due to the hoppers and disease.
Local farmers in Soc Trang Province said the brown planthopper
density this year is heavier than in past years at around 500-1000
pests on a sq. metre.
According to the Southern Plant Protection Department, a total of 65
000 hectares of rice in the south have been damaged by the disease
over the last 4 months. The affected area accounts for 10 per cent of
the south's total rice cultivation area.
At a meeting on brown hopper pest infestation held in HCM City
yesterday, rice scientists called on farmers to stop cultivating the
winter-spring rice crop to curb the outbreak of the rice disease.
However, local farmers in An Giang and Dong Thap have already planted
tens of hectares of rice for the winter-spring crop. Traditional
farming practices create favourable conditions for the brown
planthoppers to grow rapidly and spread, making the coming
winter-spring crop prone to risk.
Deputy head of the Southern Plant Protection Department Nguyen Huu
Huan said traditional rice strains such as Jasmine, OM 1490 were
easily infected by the planthopper pest. He noted that the wide use
of these rice strains, coupled with the farmers' unawareness of the
importance of prevention measures, had led to large losses.
Dr. Bui Chi Buu, head of the Southern Agricultural Scientific and
Technological Institute, said it was urgent that farmers in Mekong
Delta limit or suspend rice cultivation for the winter spring crop to
curb possible future epidemics.
In Kien Giang and Dong Thap Provinces, the areas planted with rice
strains vulnerable to brown planthoppers account for 70 per cent of
the provinces' total rice area.
Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Cao Duc Phat, attended
the meeting together with leaders from the agricultural sector in
southern provinces and HCM City. Phat said the pests and resulting
disease were serious and had spread nationwide. He called for
localities to take drastic measures and rallied all-out efforts to
fight against them. The localities should guide agencies and units to
join the fight and dispatch officials to communes to help farmers
stamp out the pests in line with sowing young rice plants, he said.
Phat also requested departments and research institutes at the
ministry to quickly provide farmers with handbooks on ways to prevent
and control the pests and with information on how to select suitable
rice varieties. He announced that heads of his ministry's departments
and research institutes were barred from going abroad during this
crisis and that unnecessary meetings were to be cancelled.
To date, over 72 000 ha of rice have been infected with locusts,
accounting for 12.2 per cent of total rice fields in the southern
provinces, it was announced at the meeting.

Nearly 60 000 ha out of 580 000 ha of paddy fields in the south have
been damaged by ragged stunt rice disease said the Plant Protection Department.
According to An Giang Province's Department of Agricultural and Rural
Development, more than 1000 ha of paddy fields in Chau Doc Town, Cho
Moi and Thoai Son districts have been destroyed.
The Southern Steering Committee for Brown Plant Hopper Control has
asked the Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Development to organise
campaigns to prevent and control the disease in the affected provinces.

[The cereal crop plant rice, _Oryza sativa_, develops symptoms of the
disease ragged stunt when infected by the virus rice ragged stunt
virus (family: _Reoviridae_, genus: _Oryzavirus_ ). It is know in
Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Thailand. A second virus, rice
grassy stunt virus (genus: _Tenuivirus_) is also a common problem
when rice ragged stunt is present. It is known in China, India,
Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and
Thailand. Both viruses are transmitted by the brown planthopper (
_Nilaparvata lugens_) which is a serious pest in its own right,
causing "hopper burn."
In September and October 2006 a series of news reports from Vietnam
indicated a severe outbreak of rice ragged stunt disease associated
with unusually high infestation rates of the brown planthopper. Four
reports are provided and together they create a picture of a serious
problem. One report indicates this insect pest causes an epidemic
every 10 years or so, and this would seem to be the start of a
current major outbreak. Some only mention the planthopper, but others
mention the ragged stunt disease, and the overall epidemic is
probably a combination of both pest and disease damage. A field
trip (see first entry in Links:) by Rogelio C Cabunagan of the
International Rice Research Institute to Vietnam in 27 Aug - 2 Sept
2006 concluded that 2 viruses (rice grassy stunt virus and rice
ragged stunt virus) were present in some diseased samples. Also the
detection of viruses in rice seedlings ready for transplanting was
made, which points to a method for distribution of the viruses. The
severity of this current epidemic implies a major impact on rice
production in Vietnam in the 2006 crop season and no doubt some
consequences for staple food supplies.
Management of the problem involves breaking the vector/crop/disease
cycle which is best done by the drastic measure of destroying the
winter rice crops, and while this is being attempted, it is clear not
all growers are willing to participate. The use of virus-free
transplants is obviously important. The use of rice cultivar IR64
with some resistance to the brown planthopper is a management tool
used in rice producing areas such as the Philippines. Rice cultivars
genetically modified to be resistant to rice viruses are also being
developed. There are no entries for brown planthopper, rice ragged
stunt or rice grassy stunt in ProMED-mail archives.
