A potentially deadly strain of the dog flu has made its way to the Triad [Piedmont Triad, the north central region of North Carolina].

H3N2 has sickened several thousand dogs nationwide and now 3 dogs in North Carolina are on that list. One of the dogs lives in Winston-Salem. It's a hope-and-pray waiting game for Dr Sandra McAvoy. Her dog is now the 3rd confirmed case of H3N2 in North Carolina.

It's a strain of dog flu that's resistant to vaccines. We first learned of a large outbreak in Chicago back in April [2015]. "And then it was quiet for a while and then all of a sudden we're hearing it again," said McAvoy. "I had somebody come in last week [week of 13 Jul 2015] and say there's a case in South Carolina and then there were a couple cases in Asheville this past week, and then my dog." So where did it come from? Dr McAvoy is also fostering a dog from the Forsyth County Humane Society. She thinks it's possible that foster dog got her dog sick.

On [Thu 16 Jul 2015], the Society is closed and a sign on the door says it's for cleaning. Dr McAvoy says 2 dogs, including the one she's fostering, were showing respiratory disease [signs]. Those dogs came from Forsyth County Animal Control. The director said he's not surprised the flu has made it here. "As the only open door shelter in Forsyth County, we've been anticipating seeing it as it's become prevalent or start showing up in North Carolina and we expect we'll see it in the future," said Tim Jennings.

The state is also testing samples from a cluster of dogs in Greensboro that are showing similar signs. "All dogs are at risk because this is something new, they've never been exposed," said Dr McAvoy. "They don't have any natural immunity to it. So it's probably going to run a course and then down the road we're going to have immune dogs, down the road we're going to have vaccines so the dogs will be vaccinated and they won't get it."

As for Dr McAvoy's dog, she's recovering from pneumonia. The dog is being hand fed to encourage the her to eat. Dr McAvoy is hopeful she'll manage to pull through; 2 percent of the dogs that have caught this strain have died. Meantime, the state has set up a website to keep you in the loop when it comes to the dog flu.

You can't catch this strain from your dog, but you can pass it on to other dogs. Be sure to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water and follow it with an alcohol based soap or sanitizer between every animal you pet or touch. If you have a dog, keep an eye out for signs and don't touch other dogs without washing your hands. Vets recommend not taking your dog to dog parks or any places where dogs gather.

Signs for dog flu are similar to the human flu so if you notice your dog sneezing, or coughing or just seeming lethargic, take your pet to the veterinarian right away.

[Canine influenza (CI), or dog flu, is a highly contagious respiratory infection of dogs that is caused by 2 influenza A viruses. In the US, canine influenza has been caused by 2 influenza strains. The 1st strain reported in the US, beginning in 2004, was an H3N8 influenza A virus. This strain is closely related to the virus that causes equine influenza, and it is thought that the equine influenza virus mutated to produce the canine strain. In 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was caused by a separate canine influenza virus, H3N2. The strain causing the 2015 outbreak was almost genetically identical to an H3N2 strain previously reported only in Asia -- specifically, Korea, China, and Thailand. This H3N2 strain is believed to have resulted from the direct transfer of an avian influenza virus -- possibly from among viruses circulating in live bird markets -- to dogs.

Two clinical syndromes have been seen in dogs infected with canine influenza viruses -- a mild form of the disease and a more severe form that is accompanied by pneumonia.

Mild form
--------
Dogs suffering with the mild form of canine influenza develop a soft, moist cough that persists for 10 to 30 days. They may also be lethargic and have reduced appetite and a fever. Sneezing and discharge from the eyes and/or nose may also be observed. Some dogs have a dry cough similar to the traditional "kennel cough" caused by _Bordetella bronchiseptica_/parainfluenza virus complex. Dogs with the mild form of influenza may also have a thick nasal discharge, which is usually caused by a secondary bacterial infection.

Severe form
-----------
Dogs with the severe form of canine influenza develop high fevers (104-106 deg F/40-41 deg C) and have clinical signs of pneumonia, such as increased respiratory rates and effort. Pneumonia may be due to a secondary bacterial infection.

Because this is still an emerging disease and dogs in the US have not been exposed to it before, almost all dogs, regardless of breed or age, lack immunity to it and are susceptible to infection if exposed to the active virus. Virtually all dogs exposed to the virus become infected, and nearly 80 percent show clinical signs of disease, though most exhibit the mild form described above.

However, the risk of any dog being exposed to the canine influenza virus depends on that dog's lifestyle. Dogs that are frequently or regularly exposed to other dogs -- for example at boarding or day care facilities, dog parks, grooming salons, or social events with other dogs present -- are at greater risk of coming into contact with the virus. Also, as with other infectious diseases, extra precautions may be needed with puppies, elderly or pregnant dogs, and dogs that are immunocompromised. Dog owners should talk with their veterinarian to assess their dog's risk.

Fatal cases of pneumonia resulting from infection with canine influenza virus have been reported in dogs, but the fatality rate is low (less than 10 percent). Most dogs recover in 2-3 weeks.

The 1st recognized outbreak of canine influenza in the world is believed to have occurred in racing greyhounds in January 2004 at a track in Florida. From June to August of 2004, outbreaks of respiratory disease were reported at 14 tracks in 6 states (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kansas, Texas, and West Virginia). Between January and May 2005, outbreaks occurred at 20 tracks in 11 states (Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin). Canine influenza viruses have been reported in at least 30 states and Washington, DC.

The H3N2 strain of canine influenza virus had been reported in Korea, China, and Thailand, but had not been detected outside of those countries until 2015. In April 2015, an outbreak that started in Chicago was determined to be caused by an H3N2 strain that was genetically almost identical to the one in Asia.

The 1st canine vaccine for H3N8 canine influenza was approved in 2009, and there are several H3N8 canine influenza vaccines available. At this time, there is not an H3N2 vaccine available in the United States, and it is not known whether the H3N8 vaccine will offer any protection against the H3N2 strain. Canine influenza vaccines are considered "lifestyle" vaccines, meaning the decision to vaccinate is based on a dog's risk of exposure. Dog owners should consult their veterinarian to determine whether vaccination is needed.

Canine influenza virus can be spread via direct contact with respiratory secretions from infected dogs, and by contact with contaminated inanimate objects. Therefore, dog owners whose dogs are coughing or exhibiting other signs of respiratory disease should not participate in activities or bring their dogs to facilities where other dogs can be exposed to them. Clothing, equipment, surfaces, and hands should be cleaned and disinfected after exposure to dogs showing signs of respiratory disease to prevent transmission of infection to susceptible dogs. Clothing can be adequately cleaned by using a detergent at normal laundry temperatures.

Canine influenza is not known to be transmissible from dogs to people. However, caretakers can inadvertently transmit canine influenza virus from infected dogs to susceptible dogs by not following good hygiene and infection control practices. To prevent spread of canine influenza virus, caretakers should take the following precautions:
1. Wash hands with soap and water (if soap and water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner):
- upon arriving at the facility;
- before and after handling each animal;
- after coming into contact with animal saliva, urine, feces, or blood;
- after cleaning cages;
- before eating meals, taking breaks, smoking, or leaving the facility;
- before and after using the restroom
2. Wear a barrier gown over your clothes and wear gloves when handling sick animals or cleaning cages. Discard gown and gloves before working with other animals.
3. Consider use of goggles or face protection if splashes from contaminated surfaces may occur.
4. Bring a change of clothes to wear home at the end of the day.
5. Thoroughly clean clothes worn at the animal facility.
6. Do not allow animals to "kiss" you or lick your face.
7. Do not eat in the animal care area.
8. Separate newly arriving animals from animals that have been housed one week or longer.
9. Routinely monitor animals for signs of illness. Separate sick animals from healthy animals, especially animals with signs of respiratory disease.

There is no evidence of transmission of canine influenza virus from dogs to people. However, because of concerns about diseases that are transmissible from dogs to people, in general, it may be prudent for young children, the elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons to limit or avoid contact with animals that are ill.

There is no evidence thus far that this strain of influenza can be transmitted between dogs and people or from dogs to cats.
