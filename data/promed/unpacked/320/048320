8 questions consumers should ask on the threat of mad cow disease
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization is today publishing a new document to assist
governments, consumers' associations, and other concerned organizations to
protect consumers from the dangers of consuming beef infected with bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or "mad cow disease"). The document provides
governments and others involved in consumer protection with background
information on the disease and how to prevent its spread.
Here are some of the most important questions for consumers to ask their
national public health and veterinary authorities. These questions are most
important in countries where BSE cases have been reported. In view of the
long incubation period and the fact that contaminated feed has been widely
distributed in international trade, however, consumers and governments in
other countries would be wise to consider these questions as well.
1.What are cattle being fed?
BSE is clearly linked to the practice of recycling bovine carcasses to
recover so-called "meat and bone meal" protein, and then feeding this
protein back to other cattle. If cattle are not being fed protein derived
from the carcasses of ruminants (cattle, sheep, and goats), there is
virtually no risk of BSE. If ruminant protein is fed only to pigs and
poultry, and if this feed has no chance to mix with and contaminate cattle
feed, at feed mills or on the farm, the risk of BSE in the country is
insignificant.
2.Does the government have a system of active surveillance for BSE?
The recent introduction of rapid screening tests, compulsory in many
countries, has greatly improved the detection of cases. Such "active"
detection of infected cattle, followed by their destruction, prevents entry
into the feed chain of a large proportion of infectious material. News of a
few cases in countries with active surveillance is more reassuring than no
reported cases in countries with poor surveillance.
3.Are cases of BSE imported or are they being born within the countrys herds?
Within cattle herds, BSE is not contagious and does not spread from animal
to animal. Isolated imported cases will not spark an epidemic if the
affected cattle are destroyed and the carcasses are not recycled for use in
feed. Of much greater concern are cases of BSE in cattle born within the
national herd, as this implies that feeding practices within the country
are at fault and that many other cattle have been exposed.
4. Does meat come from young cattle?
The incubation period for BSE is very long: 4 to 5 years. During this
period, cattle exposed to the BSE agent show no symptoms and, until late in
the period, have no infectious material in their tissues. If cattle are
slaughtered at a young age (preferably under 30 months), the likelihood
that veal or beef and other bovine products can transmit vCJD is greatly
reduced.
5. Are high-risk tissues removed and destroyed?
The agent that causes BSE is not distributed evenly throughout the animals
body, but is concentrated in certain tissues, most notably the brain and
spinal cord, related to the central nervous system. Stringent slaughter
practices that remove and destroy these high-risk tissues have an immediate
impact on food safety and can protect consumers even when BSE is
established within a country.
6. Are procedures in place to prevent cross-contamination in slaughterhouses?
The agent that causes BSE, and presumably vCJD, has never been detected in
bovine skeletal muscle tissues, from which most quality meat is derived.
However, an extremely small amount of the causative agent -­ less than one
gram of brain (the size of a peppercorn) from diseased cattle ­- is
sufficient to cause infection in cattle. For humans, the amount capable of
causing infection is unknown but could likewise be very small. For this
reason, it is vital to guard against cross-contamination. Safe
slaughterhouse practices ensure that high-risk materials have no chance to
come into contact with otherwise safe materials and contaminate them.
7.Are there any other meat products that could contain BSE?
The use of wire brushes and other mechanical tools to recover meat scraps
attached to bones and the vertebral column can pull out infectious nervous
tissue and contaminate meat that is otherwise safe. Such "mechanically
recovered meat" is used in processed meat products. Some experts believe
that the BSE agent was transmitted to humans through products containing
mechanically recovered meat contaminated with nervous tissue. Techniques
that prevent the inclusion of nervous tissue in mechanically recovered meat
confer important protection, particularly in high-risk countries.
8. Are safe practices stringently controlled?
It is not sufficient to recommend safe practices. Such practices must also
be rigorously enforced, ideally through legislation, and controlled through
inspection by veterinary and food authorities.
On the basis of current knowledge, scientists agree that some bovine
products are safe, regardless of the BSE status within a given country.
Bovine products considered safe to eat or use include milk and milk
products, gelatin prepared exclusively from hides and skins, and collagen
prepared exclusively from hides and skins. Infectivity has never been
detected in skeletal muscle tissues, from which most quality meat is
derived. A number of scientists believe that skeletal muscle meat is as
safe to consume as milk and milk products, provided that such meat has not
been contaminated during slaughterhouse procedures.

Health group: mad cow disease still a risk
------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization warned on Thu 30 Jan 2003 that many
countries, particularly in eastern Europe and South East Asia, were at risk
from mad cow disease, even though the worst appeared over in Britain.
Although most developed countries had adequate measures in place to fight
the deadly infection in cattle, which has been linked to more than 100
human deaths, some other states had not woken up to the dangers, it said.
"Our concern is that there are countries out there which may be developing
BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) and are not doing anything about
it," said Dr Maura Ricketts, of WHO's animal and food related public health
risks division.
BSE was first detected in Britain in the mid-1980s and has since spread to
a number of mainly European countries. Some 130 people, most of them
Britons, have died from what is believed to be a human variation of the
brain-wasting disease after presumably eating infected meat, triggering
global alarm.
The WHO official, presenting a report on the BSE threat, said contaminated
meat and bone meal animal feed were known to have been exported to a number
of countries where few or no cases of the fatal disease had yet been
reported. Far from being a cause for concern, the reporting of cases could
be a reassuring sign the authorities were taking steps to detect infection
and to eradicate the problem, she said. Central and eastern European
countries as a whole were large importers of this material. Slovakia,
Slovenia, and the Czech Republic have reported cases, but other countries
need to be checking this," she added. South East Asia, along with parts of
North Africa, were other areas where significant amounts of contaminated
feed had been imported from Western Europe, she said.
All cases of BSE have been traced to imports of animal feed or cattle from
Britain, or later from the European Union. After peaking at around 40 000
cases in 1993, the incidence of BSE in Britain declined sharply to little
over 1200 in 2001, although this was still more than the total number
recorded in the rest of the world that year.
Ricketts said there was still much to learn about BSE and its human form,
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, including the maximum incubation period
in humans. There had been fears that the human fatalities could soar if the
incubation period was very long. "As time goes on, I do not think many
people are predicting huge epidemics anymore," she said.
BSE was clearly linked to the recycling of cattle carcasses to recover meat
and bone meal protein which was then fed back to other cattle, WHO said.
The European Union and other countries have banned the use of such feed for
cattle and taken numerous other measures including strict slaughterhouse
regulations.
The east European and richer Asian countries were of particular concern,
because they were states which had already developed, or had the potential
to develop, their own industries using cattle waste material -- anything
not eaten by humans -- and recycling it as animal feed.
The WHO report -- "Understanding the BSE Threat" -- is intended as an alarm
call to governments about what actions they should be taking as well as
providing consumers with information about the risks posed by contaminated
meat.

Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Japan
------------------------------------------
(Date of previous case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Japan
reported to the OIE: August 2002).
Information received on 21 Jan 2003 from Dr Toshikazu Ijichi, director of
Animal Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
Tokyo: report date: 21 Jan 2003.
One outbreak, laboratory confirmed on 20 Jan 2003, Naga gun, Wakayama
Prefecture. Affected population: a Holstein cow aged 6 years and 11 months,
born in Hokkaido Prefecture and then transferred to a dairy farm in
Wakayama Prefecture, which was slaughtered at the abattoir on 17 Jan 2003.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / susceptible /cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / ... / 1 / 0 / ... / 1
Diagnosis:
- The brain sample from the cow tested positive to the ELISA-based BSE
screening test required by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for
all cattle slaughtered at abattoirs since 18 Oct 2001 (Wakayama City Public
Health Center, Meat Inspection Office (Wakayama city, Wakayama Prefecture)).
- The brain sample was sent to the National Institute of Infectious Disease
(Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo) for confirmation and was subjected to western blot
analysis and immunohistochemical examination, with a positive result on 20
Jan 2003.
Source of agent / origin of infection: under investigation.
Control measures:
- The dairy farm in Wakayama Prefecture where the affected animal was kept
and the dairy farm in Hokkaido Prefecture where it was born have been
placed under movement control by Kihoku Livestock Hygiene Service Center
and Kushiro Livestock Hygiene Service Center, respectively.
- Identification of all animals that were kept with the infected cow.
- Epidemiological investigation of the feed used on the farm, as a possible
source of infection.
Note from the OIE Central Bureau: As from now, any further cases of BSE in
Japan will no longer be notified in Disease Information but will
immediately be incorporated into the table on the number of reported cases
of BSE worldwide (excluding the United Kingdom).

18 foci declared since the start of tests
-----------------------------------------
The agriculture department of Catalonia confirms 2 cases of BSE, one on 23
Jan 2003 in the Alt Urgell slaughterhouse, originating in Ribera de
Urgellet (Lleida), and the other today, 28 Jan 2003, from Banyoles
(Girona), where 23 cattle have been destroyed [later in the story it says
80 cows and 75 calves were destroyed in that herd. - Mod.JW]
These cases bring to 18 the total number of cattle affected by BSE in
Catalonia since 1 Jan 2001, when the European Union regulations for testing
entered into force: 6 in 2001, 10 in 2002, plus these 2.

SSC opinions on waste-disposal systems
--------------------------------------
The Scientific Steering Committee of the EU has adopted, during its meeting
on 16-17 Jan 2003, the following opinions on BSE risk reduction by means of
3 waste disposal systems. These are their respective summaries:
1. The use of small incinerators for BSE risk reduction.
Small incinerators are widely used to meet the needs of local communities.
These incinerators vary greatly in their design, nature of use, performance
characteristics, and the quality of their management. As a consequence of
this variability, there are many uncertainties in identifying risks posed
by small incinerators that are used to treat SRM [specified risk material],
and each type should eventually receive its own assessment. Also, general
operating and control criteria should be established for safe incineration,
as it has been done for large incinerators.
2. Open burning of potentially transmissible spongiform encephalopathy
infected animal materials.
(1) "Burning" covers a wide variety of combustion conditions. This opinion
is concerned with the process of open burning -- for example, bonfires.
(2) There are serious concerns regarding the use of open burning for the
destruction of pathogen-contaminated animal waste, particularly for waste
which may be contaminated with relatively heat-stable pathogens. Issues
include: the potentially very high variability of the pathogen
inactivation, the nature of the gaseous and particulate emissions, and the
risks from the residual ash.
(3) The SSC recommends that open burning is considered for pathogen
destruction only under exceptional circumstances following a specific risk
assessment. In the case of animal waste possibly contaminated with BSE/TSE
in view of the uncertainty of the risk, open burning should be considered a
risk. Suitable monitoring methods for TSE contamination of both air and ash
are needed. Protocols for safe burning in emergency situations need to be
established.
3.The use of burial for dealing with animal carcasses and other animal
materials that might contain BSE/TSE.
(1) The term "burial" includes a diversity of disposal conditions. Although
burial is widely used for disposal of waste, the degradation process
essential for BSE/TSE infectivity reduction is very difficult to control.
The extent to which such an infectivity reduction can occur as a
consequence of burial is poorly characterised. It would appear to be a slow
process in various circumstances.
(2) A number of concerns have been identified including potential for
groundwater contamination, dispersal/transmission by birds/animals/insects,
and accidental uncovering by man.
(3) In the absence of any new data, the SSC confirms its previous opinion
that for animal material which could possibly be contaminated with BSE/TSE,
burial poses a risk except under highly controlled conditions (for example,
controlled landfill).

Israel's plan to prevent mad cow disease in humans
--------------------------------------------------
The Israeli government has approved the proposal of the minister of
agriculture, Zippi Livni, to extend the programme for the prevention of mad
cow disease in humans. The allocated annual budget is 17.6 million NIS [3.7
million US dollars], to be provided by 4 ministries: Agriculture (4.8),
Finance (4.8), Health (4.0), and Environment (4.0).
The programme includes 3 main components:
1. Continued brain testing of cattle older than 30 months, prior to their
release for human consumption.
2. Destruction of selected organs of cattle older than 15 months. The
relevant organs are the skull (excluding tongue and head meat), the spinal
cord, and the intestines. These organs are regarded as risky, since they
may contain the disease causative agent, the prion.
3. Intensified control, inspection, and law enforcement upon cattle
movements and their slaughter. This relates mainly to the prevention of
illegal slaughter without veterinary inspection.
The Veterinary Services in the Ministry of Agriculture have informed that
since the programme was initially put into operation in July 2002, more
than 5000 cows have been examined at the Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan,
all found healthy.

[The actual number of animals tested since 2002 within the Israeli BSE
programme exceeds 11 000. This includes 53 clinically suspected, 896 fallen
stock, and 10 238 "healthy", over 30 months old slaughtered cattle. The
first and only positive case was a 10 year old clinically suspected cow,
diagnosed on 29 May 2002. See Weekly BSE report, 30 Jan to 5 Feb 2003:
