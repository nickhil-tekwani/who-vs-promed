One person has died and 7 others have been badly affected by mosquito-borne viruses that are increasingly being detected in southeast Australia.

SA [South Australia state] Health said the La Nina weather pattern was increasing the risk of mosquito-borne diseases in South Australia, including flavivirus infection.

It said there had been 7 cases of acute encephalitis -- or brain inflammation -- in the state during the past month. All required hospitalisation and one person died. There are 4 people still in hospital.

"In recent weeks, Kokobera virus has been detected in adult mosquitoes locally here in the Riverland, and what we have seen so far interstate is the detection of the rare Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in pigs in NSW, Victoria, and Queensland, while West Nile virus (Kunjin variant) was detected in horses in NSW in January [2022]," deputy chief public health officer Chris Lease said.

"Kokobera virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and Murray Valley encephalitis virus all belong to a group of viruses called flaviviruses. Most people who are infected with these viruses are asymptomatic or develop a mild febrile illness, but a small proportion of infected people -- less than 1% -- will develop encephalitis, which may be fatal or cause long-term neurological damage."

Symptoms of encephalitis can include confusion, headaches, neck stiffness, tremors, drowsiness and seizures.

Search for Japanese encephalitis virus [JEV]
--------------------------------------------
Chief veterinary officer Mary Carr said the Department of Primary Industries and Regions was undertaking surveillance measures to monitor for JEV, which is normally only seen in the Torres Strait.

"The normal life cycle of JEV is between waterbirds and mosquitoes, which may then accidentally spill over to pigs and horses, but there are currently no confirmed livestock detections of JEV in South Australia," Dr. Carr said.

Sentinel chickens along the Murray River are used to monitor for viruses.

There have been 77 Ross River cases reported in the state so far this year [2022], compared to 48 cases at the same time last year [2021].

SA Health has urged people to wear long, loose-fitting, light-coloured clothing outside and use a repellent containing DEET or picaridin.

Industry well prepared for an outbreak
--------------------------------------
Victorian Farmers Federation Pig Group president and pork producer Tim Kingma lives just 50 km [31 mi] from the positive case in Echuca and said the industry was well prepared for an outbreak.

"For us to see a 1% change in our piggeries, we would know, but for us to see a 10% change, warning bells will be going off straight away," Mr. Kingma said.

"With threats of Australian [sic African?] Swine Fever over the past few years, the industry takes biosecurity matters very seriously. We already have a lot of mosquitos, so we have a lot of things already implemented on the farms to combat them."

Mr. Kingma said it was important to emphasise that the virus did not impact the safety or quality of the pork meat. There is no issue at all with the meat, it's just a virus that comes in and affects just some pigs," he said.

CSIRO [Council of Scientific and Industrial Research Organization] concerned
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
CSIRO director of strategic projects and mosquito expert, Dr. Paul De Barro, said the spread of the virus was a serious concern. "It'll kill you if you get infected, or has the potential to," he said. "It's not a very common disease, but it's one of those ones which we do actually keep a close watch on, simply because it can cause human fatality."

Dr. De Barro said the virus was normally detected across the Northern Territory, Queensland and the Torres Strait, but recent wet conditions had created a perfect storm for the virus to also spread into NSW and Victoria.

He said a mosquito named _Culex annulirostris_ was the main transmitter. "It's an ideal mosquito for La Nina conditions because it loves areas where there's been a bit of flood, where there's water in tree hollows and so on," he said. "This one actually is a highly mobile mosquito, so it'll fly many kilometres. So the real protection is making sure you're not getting bitten."

[ProMED-mail thanks Mahmoud Orabi for submitting this report.

Australia has several mosquito-borne viruses. Vector mosquito populations, and hence virus transmission, is dependent on rainfall to provide breeding habitat. The above report indicates that current La Ni√±a conditions have increased rainfall and some flooding providing breeding sites for _Culex annulirostris__ mosquitoes. The appearance of JE virus on mainland Australia illustrates the changes in virus distribution and spread into new areas that can occur and the importance of ongoing surveillance.
