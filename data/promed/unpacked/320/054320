WHO Confirms Ebola Outbreak Over: Need to Strengthen Alert and Response
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ugandan Ebola haemorrhagic fever outbreak, which was first reported in
October 2000, is officially over. The last person to be infected by the
virus recovered 42 days ago, twice the maximum incubation period for Ebola
fever to develop.
The international response in support of the Government of Uganda helped to
break the cycle of transmission of the virus which killed 224 people in
Uganda, including health workers and Dr. Matthew Lukwiya, the physician who
first identified the outbreak. More than 20 international NGOs and
government agencies (see Annex) from WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network worked together to combat the outbreak. In particular, the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US (CDC), Epicentre, Health
Canada, Italian Cooperation, Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF), the Red Cross
and UNICEF, together with institutions in Belgium, Germany, Japan and the
United Kingdom worked closely with the doctors, nurses and staff at Gulu
Hospital and Lacor Hospital, and Ugandan government officials.
"The successful operation in Uganda emphasized what can be achieved when we
identify epidemic threats rapidly and act together swiftly. Today we
recognize the efforts of the people of Uganda, and the contributions and
achievements of our partners." says David Heymann, Executive Director of
WHO's Communicable Diseases. "Epidemic prone diseases are harmful to
communities and ignore national borders. We need to recognize them as
threats to global health security and coordinate effective international
solutions." In this regard, WHO is working to mobilize the international
community to strengthen epidemic alert and response and raise awareness of
the global threat of infectious diseases. Global health security will be a
top agenda item at this year's World Health Assembly.
First reports from Gulu District of an unusual severe febrile illness
reached the Ugandan Ministry of Health in Kampala on 8 Oct 2000. Even
before the disease was formally identified as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, the
Government of Uganda facilitated rapid access to the outbreak area and
partners in WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network responded with
technical experts, protective equipment and logistics support for the
Outbreak Response.
Initial laboratory confirmation was carried out by the National Institute
of Virology in South Africa. A field laboratory was maintained at Lacor
Hospital by CDC throughout the outbreak. This innovative measure guaranteed
essential laboratory services for diagnostic tests to confirm or refute
Ebola virus infection, and for packaging and transport of clinical samples
requiring additional investigations.
Direct financial support to the Ebola Appeal was provided by Canada, ECHO,
the European Commission, Ireland, Norway and Japan to supplement
contingency funding provided by Germany and the Netherlands. In addition,
many donors and agencies provided assistance directly to Uganda.
The mobilization of the local community in Gulu played a pivotal role in
controlling the Ebola outbreak and is central to a new early-warning
surveillance system for epidemic-prone diseases. Following the Ebola
Outbreak partners in WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network and
Uganda's Ministry of Health are implementing a community-based disease
surveillance system that will significantly improve people's lives and
represents a potential model for future development of community-based
surveillance systems.
Ebola haemorrhagic fever is one of the most virulent viral diseases known
to humankind, causing death in 50-90% of all clinically ill cases. The
virus was first identified in a western equatorial province of Sudan and in
a nearby region of Zaire (now Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1976
after significant epidemics in Yambuku, northern Zaire, and Nzara, southern
Sudan. Including the most recent outbreak, about 1500 cases with over 1000
deaths have been documented since the virus was discovered.
[The WHO Report concludes with an Annex listing the Partners in the Global
Outbreak Alert and Repose Network.
