A 34-year-old Victorian knackery [or renderer] worker infected with
anthrax is recovering in hospital after handling cattle carcasses
affected with the bacteria. The afflicted knackery worker is being
treated in hospital with an antibiotic drip and is expected to make a
full recovery.
In the 1st [apparently human] case in the state for 10 years, the man
was diagnosed with a skin infection from anthrax early last week [28
Jan - 3 Feb 2007].
Over the past few weeks, 25 cattle have been affected with the
disease on four farms in the Stanhope area in the state's north. The
state's chief veterinary officer Hugh Millar was quick to allay fears
over the potentially deadly disease. Dr. Millar said the bacteria
have existed in Australia for the past 150 years and incidents
commonly occurred in warmer months when cattle forage deeper into the
soil. "This is an incident which is, from our point of view,
routine," Dr. Millar said. "We have sporadic incidents like this once
or twice a year, every year. "Fortunately naturally occurring anthrax
in animals is quite a simple thing to contain."
Dr. Millar said the cattle sent to the Stanhope knackery, where the
worker was infected, were not known to be affected with the disease
when they were dispatched there.
However, Dr. Millar acknowledged there had been cases of affected
cattle in the Stanhope area before the worker was infected with anthrax.
A Department of Human Services spokesman said the last case of
anthrax in a human was in Tatura in February 1997.

[When anthrax falls into the background, the ongoing low-frequency
sporadic cases routinely get missed if there is not a procedure in
place to routinely check unexpected deaths. This appears to be the
case here. And thus, instead of the disease disappearing, which it
should when there are proper control procedures in place, it persists
with the capacity to produce multiple cases on more than one site.
And spread yet again. Soil recontamination just allows it to persist
and to produce new cases in future years. These 4 'new' farms should
have their stock annually vaccinated for the next 3-5 years to
prevent further cases. Further information is being sought from Dr. Millar.
