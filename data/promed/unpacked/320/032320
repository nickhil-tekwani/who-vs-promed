Another 2 women have fallen victims to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), known as Congo fever, in a week, taking the total toll due to the virus to 3, the state government said on [Wed 28 Aug 2019]. New cases also have come to light, it added.

Speaking at a press conference on [Wed 28 Aug 2019], deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, who also holds the health portfolio, said, "Till [Tue 27 Aug 2019], 2 deaths were reported from Surendran-agar district. The latest deceased hailed from Bhavnagar district."

Three new cases have been reported -- one at Jamda village near Limdi and 2 others near Halvad village (Surendranagar district). Among them, a 55 year old is undergoing treatment at Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, while 2 others are being treated at SVP Hospital.

According to the state health department, since [23 Aug 2019] until [Wed 28 Aug 2019], 17 samples were tested at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, of which 6 tested positive. 3 of them succumbed to CCHF, while 3 others are undergoing treatment. The samples of 11 others, including doctors, staff nurse, lab technicians, and others who came in close contact with the patients, tested negative.

Dr Bhavin Solanki, medical officer with the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), said, "From [20 Aug 2019 till 29 Aug 2019], 15 people were treated at the SVP Hospital, of which 10 are paramedical staff and doctors who came in contact with the patients. All 10 are stable. another 3 patients are from Halvad, one a local (Ahmedabad) patient and one who expired." All 15 samples have not been tested yet.

Health commissioner Jayanti Ravi said since cattle-rearers are more susceptible to the CCHF virus, which is responsible for the infection, preventive measures are being taken.

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) website, "CCHF spreads to humans either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission can occur from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons. Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse of needles, and contamination of medical supplies."

Symptoms include fever, muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes, and sensitivity to light, according to WHO. "There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After 2-4 days, the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression, and lassitude," the WHO website states.

The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30 percent, with death occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of illness.

In the South East Asian region, the1st laboratory-confirmed case was reported on [19 Jan 2011] in Gujarat. Subsequent outbreaks were reported from different districts of Gujarat every year. During 2012-2015, several outbreaks and cases of CCHF transmitted by ticks via livestock and several nosocomial infections were reported in the states of Gujarat and Rajasthan.

It seems the deadly Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has started to spread its tentacles in the state [Gujarat] with hospitals in several districts registering suspected cases of the disease. So far, 30 suspected cases of CCHF have been reported in state.

The administration, which is on high alert, is taking no chances with any person exhibiting the symptoms of CCHF, especially considering the fact that the highly-infectious disease has a high mortality rate of 40 per cent.

According to the health department's deputy director (epidemic) Dinkar Raval, there are 6 confirmed cases of CCHF in the state and out of them, 3 have already died, whereas the remaining are availing treatment at isolation wards in state-run hospitals. Raval, however, did not clarify the number of suspected CCHF cases in the state.

The health department sources confirmed that there are around 11 suspected cases of CCHF from Morbi and they have been kept under close observation at Civil Hospital. All these 11 persons are labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Bihar, working in a plastics factory.

"We have sent blood samples of all the 11 persons on [Thu 29 Aug 2019] and we are awaiting the results. Meanwhile, all the symptomatic treatment is being rendered to them," a health department official said.

Apart from the suspected cases from Morbi, 3 other suspected cases of CCHF have been admitted to Sir T Hospital in Bhavnagar. Health department officials said the suspected cases were in close contact with the woman of Kamlej village, who died due to CCHF on [22 Aug 2019].

Besides the death in Bhavnagar, 2 other confirmed deaths due to CCHF have been registered in the state so far -- one at Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Hospital in Ahmedabad and another at CU Shah Medical College and Hospital in Surendranagar.

Meanwhile, Ahmedabad Civil Hospital's superintendent MM Prabhakar told DNA that 2 more suspected cases of CCHF have been admitted in the infectious disease ward. One is a 15-year-old boy from Rajasthan, whereas the other case is from Botad. "We have sent the sample to NIV and are awaiting results," the superintendent said.

Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) officials said no fresh suspected case have been admitted at SVP Hospital and the samples of doctors and paramedics, who were in close contact with the 75-year-old woman who died due to CCHF, have been found negative. Except for the deceased and 2 other patients from Halvad, all other samples have tested negative, officials said.

[Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a highly infectious zoonotic disease of humans transmitted by _Hyalomma_ ticks. Earlier studies have shown CCHF seroprevalence in livestock throughout India, yet sporadic outbreaks have been recorded mostly from the Gujarat state of India since 2011.

Occupational vulnerability to CCHF for animal handlers, veterinarians, abattoir workers, and healthcare workers has been reported (https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12879-019-3740-x)

CCHF was first confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak in 2011 in Gujarat state (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229708).

The reports above do not mention the epidemiological history of the cases. - Mod.UBA
