Large-scale contact tracing after a case of open tuberculosis in a
supermarket, the Netherlands, Jan-Feb 2005
--------------------------------------------
Between 31 Jan and 4 Feb 2005, over 21 000 people in the city of Zeist in
the Netherlands were tested for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) or
active tuberculosis (TB) after possible exposure via a supermarket
employee. This employee had been diagnosed with open (sputum
smear-positive) tuberculosis in Nov 2004.

In Dec 2004, a "1st ring" contact investigation (1), using tuberculin skin
testing (Mantoux) and/or chest x-ray, revealed that all family members and
close contacts of the index case (n=12) tested positive for LTBI, and 1
active case of TB was diagnosed. A "2nd ring" contact investigation was
then performed, where all current and former colleagues of the index
patient were tested and 44/77 current employees and 14/26 former employees
tested positive for LTBI by Mantoux test. 1 active case of TB was also
diagnosed in this group. Because of these results, an investigation of a
"3rd ring" of contacts, which included all people who had visited this
supermarket between 1 Jan and 18 Nov 2004, was launched.

Mantoux tests were performed on 15 515 people and 6000 people were screened
by chest x-ray. In total, 350/14 128 people (2.5 per cent) whose Mantoux
tests were evaluated had a positive reaction (greater than 14 mm). Those
350 people with suspected infections, and an additional 58 people (patients
with suspected pulmonary problems, abnormal chest x-ray, or patients with
risk factors for TB in conjunction with a Mantoux 5-14mm) were invited for
further diagnostic tests at the tuberculosis clinic of the Municipal Health
Department in Utrecht during Feb 2005.

To date, about 2/3 of the 408 patients with either positive Mantoux test or
abnormal chest x-ray have been examined for TB, and 5 new cases have been
diagnosed. 1 of these 5 patients has open TB, and contact tracing linked to
this case has also been initiated.

So far, no conclusion can be drawn about the extent to which there has been
an increased transmission of tuberculosis to customers in this supermarket.
Data collection is continuing, and descriptive analysis of the 408 possible
cases of LTBI has begun.

[Certainly the expansion of "ring" screening to supermarket customers was
appropriate, given the percentage of employees that were found to have
evidence of TB exposure. It would be useful to assess a similar cohort of
individuals in the community who did not shop at this supermarket for
comparison with the group of 408 additional shoppers. - Mod.LL]
