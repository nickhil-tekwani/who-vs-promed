Who Appeals For International Support For Control And Prevention Of Rift
Valley Fever In Yemen
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) is launching an appeal for US$ 975 000
to support international efforts to control and prevent Rift Valley Fever
in Yemen. This viral hemorrhagic fever causes severe disease amongst both
humans and animals, posing a serious public health risk and economic losses
due to loss of livestock. In September 2000, Rift Valley fever was reported
for the first time outside Africa. Cases were confirmed in Saudi Arabia and
Yemen. As of 9 Oct 2000, 321 cases with 32 deaths, and a case fatality rate
of 10%, have been reported by the Ministry of Public Health, Yemen.
The response requires strengthening the basic infrastructure,
epidemiological surveillance and human resources in Yemen that are needed
for dealing with this emergency. In particular, the economic impact of the
restriction on animal movement and trade is causing severe hardship amongst
local inhabitants. High-level agreement between Saudi Arabia and Yemen to
conduct a joint investigation has ensured effective coordination of the
international response to control the disease on both sides of the border.
WHO experts are working with both governments in the outbreak zone.
The Appeal seeks support for vector surveillance and control, strengthening
laboratory capacity, capacity building and human resource development,
strengthening epidemiological surveillance of Rift Valley fever and
providing essential supplies, equipment and critical supportive materials.
Rift Valley fever primarily affects animals (cattle, sheep, camels, goats)
but can cause outbreaks of disease in humans. Usually, the virus is spread
by the bite of infected mosquitoes. During outbreaks, people become
infected either by being bitten by mosquitoes or through contact with the
blood, other body fluids or organs of infected animals. Such contact may
occur during the care or slaughtering of infected animals or possibly from
the ingestion of raw milk.
