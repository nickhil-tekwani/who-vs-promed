Diarrhea / decreased milk yield syndrome
-------------------------------
[The following data have been derived and summarised from the 2 reports available at the above URL's. - Mod.AS]

Since 30 Sep 2012, 83 Dairy cattle farms throughout Israel have reported to the main office of "Hachaklait" a sudden drop in the milk production. In 60 of the said farms (72 percent), diarrhoea was seen as well, affecting up to 50 percent of the lactating cows (median, 10 percent). There have been also some diarrhoea cases in dry (non-lactating) cows and youngs stock, but its incidence was significantly lower. No other symptoms nor mortality have been reported; the affected animals as well as their milk yield seem to be recovering. The highest rectal temperatures, recorded only in some of the affected animals, have reportedly reached 40 centigrade [104 deg F]. The described events have been reported from Israel's districts located above (northern) to the Beer Sheva latitude, namely most of the less-arid, populated territories; they seem to be more abundant along the coastal areas.

Epidemiological and laboratory investigations have commenced, with the following differential diagnostic factors taken into consideration:
1. Feed-related factors (including mycotoxins and insecticides)
2. Climatic factors (elevated heat stress observed during the relevant period)
3. Infectious agents, including bluetongue virus (BTV), Schmallenberg virus (SBV), Epizootic Haemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) and corona virus.

Questionnaires with a case definition have been circulated to all "Hachaklait" practitioners, stressing the need to obtain detailed clinical observations, including rectal temperatures. Feed, fecal and blood samples have been collected.

[Israel's dairy herd includes nearly 1000 farms with about 120 000 lactating cows. These high-yielding animals (the average annual milk yield was 11 667 kg per cow during 2011), are very vulnerable to health hazards with potential far-reaching economic implications. The structure of the Israeli farming industry, and especially of the dairy sector, is extremely centralized and intensive, with significant dependence upon imported forage. Any serious failure in one of the pipes serving the system -- such as harbour silo, a ship with a load of grains or an animal-feed mill -- may cause a havoc in country-wide encompassing dimensions.

A serious such event took place in September 1983, when dairy farms throughout Israel suffered a syndrome manifested by indigestion and milk yield decrease. It was eventually found that all affected farms shared barley from the same imported batch, which eventually was found to be contaminated with mycotoxins. Following the event, the control upon forage underwent revision, new legislation was imposed. It has become a legal requirement to have sanitary certification, including prescribed lab test results, accompanying imported grain consignments.

Nearly 90 percent of Israel's dairy herds are members of the cooperative non-governmental organization (NGO) "Hachaklait" for clinical veterinary services (http://tinyurl.com/8ctj3vf). This structure allows quick collection and dissemination of epidemiological data and samples and, ideally, immediate response. "Hachaklait" maintain close collaboration with the State Veterinary Services and the Kimron Veterinary Institute.

The described symptoms are not specific. On top of the non-infectious etiologies under investigation, the possible involvement of an infectious agent is being addressed as well. Among the 4 potential agents named, SBV-like pathogen deserves priority in view of the season, spatial spread and clinical symptoms (though no high fever reported).

Results of the investigations, including the exclusion of food-safety hazards, will be appreciated. - Mod.AS
