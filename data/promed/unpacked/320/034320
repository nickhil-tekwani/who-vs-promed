[The Belgian ASF event's most recent update was presented during a ministerial conference, organised by the European Commission, addressing the "eradication of African swine fever (ASF) in the EU and the long-term management of wild boar populations". This conference took place in Brussels yesterday (Tue 19 Dec 2018); thanks to Sabine Zentis for submitting its documented presentations.

Belgium's presentation, "African swine fever in wild boar: Belgian case", including 13 slides, is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_asf_conf-20181219_pres-06.pdf.

Slide 5 includes a map (created 18 Dec 2018) of the ASF-infected region, in the south of the province Luxembourg, Belgium's Walloon region. The infected region (zone) is divided into 4 epidemiological zones, as follows:

At the center, the "core zone" (high-risk zone) surrounded by a "buffer zone"; combined, the 2 are coined as zone II (colored green on the map).

The peripheral zone (zone I, colored blue on the map) is divided into a southern part, bordering France and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, coined "enforced surveillance zone," or "zone I south." The northern part is labeled "surveillance zone", or "zone I north".

The ASF-related policy and activities ascribed for each of the 4 zones is laid out in slide 7.

Slide 6, titled "Situation on [17 Dec 2018]," presents the following accumulated data:
"- (total of) 680 wild boars sampled,
- (of which) 571 in the infected zone
- 238 confirmed cases, all in the high-risk zone II (core zone and buffer zone, combined; green area on the map)
- zone I south (enforced surveillance zone): 213 culled; all negative
- zone I north: 38 analyses; all negative.
No outbreaks in domestic pigs."

Subscribers are encouraged to visit the report of the conference at https://ec.europa.eu/food/animals/animal-diseases/control-measures/asf/conference_en. It includes, in addition to the above reviewed Belgian presentation, 2 fact sheets, 6 additional presentations, and 2 speeches.

The concluding statement of the conference is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/ad_control-measures_asf_conf-20181219_statement.pdf. It included the following recommendations:

"All member states, where appropriate, should put their efforts to ensure
- Enhanced coordination and cooperation (including awareness raising) between agricultural and environmental side (veterinary services, farmers, forestry management bodies, hunters, etc.) to regulate wild boar populations with the objective of both to efficiently control and prevent the spreading of ASF;
- A long-term EU management strategy of wild boar population, including its appropriate reduction. This should be determined after an impact assessment, specific objectives, measures, and joint programmes of cooperation between the agriculture and environmental sector (hunting management, ban of supplementary feeding, agricultural practises) tailored to the particular situation of the member states;
- Particular attention should be paid to the management of the wild boar populations minimising wild boar dispersal in the affected territories with ASF or in the zones at risk of spread;
- Proper communication guidance and awareness campaigns towards all stakeholders (professionals, travellers, hunters, consumers) and general public should be deployed on main transport routes and borders to prevent introduction and dissemination of ASF through the human factor." - Mod.AS
