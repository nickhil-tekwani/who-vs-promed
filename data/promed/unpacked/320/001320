SEWERS, HISTORY - ENGLAND (LONDON) (03)
=======================================
Date: Tue, 04 Mar 1997 11:21:36 -0700
From: Dave Engelthaler <dengelt@hs.state.az.us>
[The following was received from Craig Levy and Dave Engelthaler, Arizona
Department of Health Services, Phoenix, in response to "Sewers, history -
England (London)"
(see
Sewers, history - England (London) 970224114616
Sewers, history - England (London) (02) 970226180812).
Obviously, we have wandered far afield from a discussion of a book about
London sewers, but I retain the subject title and trust the transition is not
too abrupt to follow the development of these thoughts. -- Mod CHC]
Craig's comments:
I would like to comment briefly on constructing wetlands as a natural
solution to sewage problems. Chuck Woolery [970226180812) made reference to
an article in the Christian Science Monitor that mentioned the Tres Rios
Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) in Phoenix, Arizona, which is constructing
wetlands to provide natural water purification. The wetlands not only
help to clean the water, but also provide wildlife habitat, especially
for a variety of birds. Unfortunately, this silver lining has a dark cloud.
The wetlands also provide breeding sites for mosquitoes, including vector
species. And, since birds are the primary reservoirs for [arboviral]
encephalitis viruses, the wetlands bring the disease vectors and reservoirs
together in close proximity to some populated areas. In the summer of 1996,
St. Louis encephalitis (SLE) virus was isolated from _Culex_ [sp.] mosquitoes
collected at Tres Rios WWTP. The wetlands at Tres Rios grew so thick with
bulrushes and cattails that it became inaccessible to city and county staff
to conduct mosquito surveillance and control. Tres Rios staff are currently
trying to resolve these mosquito surveillance and control problems, an
absolute necessity before expansion of the acreage of the wetlands can be
done.
The wetlands concept for water treatment is a popular idea that is being (or
will be) implemented in many areas across the country. Personally, I am not
opposed to developing wetlands/wildlife habitats as long as public health is
not compromised. However, it is essential that mosquito surveillance,
control, accessability to breeding sites, etc. be an integral part, if not a
priority, of the wetlands design.
--- and Dave's:
State and county officials have tentatively identified _Culex salinarius_ in
pools of mosquitoes collected from the Tres Rios site. This mosquito was not
know to occur in the area prior to the establishment of this wetlands.
Hence, the potential not only exists for the introduction of pathogenic
viruses and their reservoirs, but perhaps for the introduction of new vectors.

[_Culex salinarius_ is generally considered as, at most, an arbovirus vector
of secondary importance. Nonetheless, as Craig and Dave realize,
particularly at this time of year, "If you build it, they will come".
Solving one problem by the creation of another has, under other
circumstances, been called "Robbing Peter to pay Paul". -- chc]
