There have been 71 cases of cryptosporidiosis notified to the Public Health Unit to date this year [2017] with children under 5 the highest rates of infection. They are from the South Western Sydney Local Health District.

People who had diarrhoea are being advised not to swim in pools until at least 2 weeks because the disease spreads through person-to-person contact, drinking contaminated water, swimming in contaminated pools, handling infected animals or their manure and, in rare cases, through food.

The health unit's acting director Dr Madhumati Chatterji said it was the highest year-to-date figure since 2009 when there was a large statewide outbreak with more than 1141 notified cases.

"Cryptosporidiosis is a diarrhoeal disease caused by a parasitic infection of the intestine. The most common symptoms include diarrhoea, stomach cramps and sometimes fever, nausea, and vomiting. "There is no specific treatment for the condition and symptoms may last a few weeks in some people."

To avoid infection:
- always wash your hands with soap and running water for 10 seconds after using the toilet, changing nappies, or handling animals or their manure;
- avoid swallowing or putting pool or spa water in your mouth;
- cryptosporidiosis is confirmed by going to a GP and having a stool specimen tested

[Previous outbreaks in Australia have been linked to swimming pools and it is likely that the increase in case numbers reported here, is also linked to transmission in pools. - Mod.EP
