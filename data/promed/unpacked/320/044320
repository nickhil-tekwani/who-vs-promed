The head of the rabies prevention team at the hospital, Dr IGB Ken
Wirasandhi, is blaming the lack of rabies vaccine on the long holiday
period surrounding the Idul Fitri. As a result, a number of dog-bite
victims, sometimes numbering as many as 50 in a single day, are not being
supplied with the life-saving vaccine.

According to Wirasandhi, "We only have one supplier (of vaccine) from
Jakarta, and, because of the long holiday, perhaps we will only have shots
available again on 29 Sep 2009. The doctor said that in the current
shortage of vaccine, his team was trying to optimize the situation by
giving the small amount of remaining vaccine to people bitten by dogs in
areas known go be heavily infected with rabies.

"The remaining vaccine we will use for patients bitten in the hand or
shoulder. For this alone, we have given out 30 dosages of vaccine,"
explained Dr Wirasandhi.

Adding to public concern over the continuing rabies epidemic in Bali, Radar
Bali confirms the 4th rabies-related death in Tabanan regency with the
death of a 78 year old man on Wed 23 Sep 2009. The elderly farmer presented
himself with all the clinical signs of rabies, expiring 18 hours after his
admission to the Sanglah General Hospital. A doctor at the hospital
explained that once clinical symptoms of the disease have manifested
themselves, there is little that doctors can do to forestall death. Among
the clinical symptoms are nervousness; a fear of water, light and open
spaces; and foaming at the mouth.

Of the 4 suspected victims of rabies hailing from Tabanan, the Sanglah
General Hospital has taken brain-fluid samples from 3 victims in order to
verify the illness. The 78 year old Tabanan man is the 11th person to die
of rabies in Bali since November 2008.

The son of the man said his father was bitten by a dog on 8 Jul 2009 while
sleeping in an open outer pavilion of the family compound. The man was
taken to a local community health center but was not administered vaccine.
