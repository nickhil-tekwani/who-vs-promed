The vaccination of cattle against the disease "Lumpy skin disease" [LSD] is about to start; 150 000 doses of the vaccine will be used to immunize all susceptible animals in the 20 km [about 12 mi] zone around the outbreaks of the disease (ring vaccination). Vaccination will be carried out by private veterinarians. So far, we have identified 31 outbreaks of LSD in the municipalities of Dimitrovgrad and Haskovo in [the province of] Haskovo, Stara Zagora, Opan, Radnevo and Chirpan in [the province of] Stara Zagora, Hadjidimovo, Gotse Delchev, Satovcha, Petrich and Sandanski in [the province of] Plovdiv and the municipality Kocherinovo in [the province of] Kyustendil. The vaccine that will be used against LSD is a "live vaccine" which, according to European legislation, is not allowed to be used for preventive vaccination of animals. Vaccination against LSD is authorized by the Commission [only] after such epizootics in bovines are detected in the member country. Animals acquire the immunity 28 days post-vaccination. Lumpy skin disease is not dangerous to humans.

[The original media report further includes details on the conditions for the slaughter of vaccinated animals to produce fresh meat, its further processing conditions and geographic marketing restrictions in relation to intra- and international distribution within the common market and to 3rd countries, including identification requirements/labeling etc; see comments].

[Bulgaria follows Greece as an EU member-country which is required to take appropriate control measures following the detection of LSD within its boundaries. LSD is one of the 10 listed epizootic diseases covered in Council Directive 92/119/EEC (see commentary in 20160426.4184847). Vaccination against such diseases is exceptionally allowed, only if justified by the epizootiological situation. Preventive vaccination, prior to the introduction of the disease, is prohibited. In Romania, threatened by LSD but (not yet?...) infected, such vaccination seems, at present, not to be possible without changes in EU legislation.

For the recent decision of the EU in relation to the Bulgarian outbreak, please refer to "COMMISSION IMPLEMENTING DECISION (EU) 2016/645 of 22 April 2016 concerning certain protective measures against lumpy skin disease in Bulgaria"' (9 pages), published in the Official Journal of the European Union L 108/61, dated 22 Apr 2016 (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32016D0645&qid=1461854711843&from=EN).

According to the above media report of 28 Apr 2016, LSD continued its spread to 16 new outbreaks, covering already 5 provinces. The last follow-up report to the OIE (No 2) was submitted on 23 Apr 2016, reporting a total of 15 outbreaks since the start of the event.
The outbreak summary, as presented in OIE's WAHIS archive, is the following:

Total outbreaks = 15 (submitted)
Species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
Cattle / 584 / 18 / 0 / 584 / 0

The mentioned archived report with a map showing the 15 outbreaks is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000020085_20160425_164053.pdf. - Mod.AS
