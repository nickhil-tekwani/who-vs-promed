Ohio: First Case of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in 2002
--------------------------------------------------------
CHILLICOTHE: Ohio's first case this season of Rocky Mountain spotted
fever (RMSF) may have been recorded in Ross County. Dr. John Gabis
said on Monday 3 Jun 2002 that he [suspected RMSF] after his
patient's condition worsened over a 6-day period and a rash appeared
on her palms and soles and spread to her midsection. He said blood
tests performed at a private laboratory confirmed his diagnosis.
However, it still must be officially confirmed by the Ohio Department
of Health.
RMSF, a tick-borne rare and potentially fatal disease, is accompanied
by high fever, fatigue, headaches and swollen glands.
The state health department spokesman Kristopher Weiss said only 2
cases of RMSF were reported in Ohio in 2001. In 2000, there were 19
cases.

[For a comprehensive description of RMSF in North America, see the
preceding post in this thread: "Rocky Mountain spotted fever - USA

[It can be the case that mild winters during which there is less tick
die-off during overwintering may be associated with increased numbers
of tick-borne diseases. We observed this in the early 1980s in Iowa
with RMSF after a quite mild winter. Also, swollen glands are NOT
common manifestations of RMSF which is best suspected clinically with
tick or potential tick exposure, high fever, severe headache and a
compatible rash. - Mod.LL]
