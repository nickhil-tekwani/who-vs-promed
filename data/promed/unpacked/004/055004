[1] Unvaccinated pregnant women
Date: Mon 23 Aug 2021

More young and healthy pregnant people are ending up hospitalized on ventilators, delivering babies prematurely, and sometimes dying from COVID-19 during the delta-fueled spike in cases.

Doctors across the country are reporting this trend, not seen in previous surges, largely in the South but also in states like California and Washington. As of 14 Aug [2021], 76.2% of pregnant people were unvaccinated.

Pregnant women with COVID-19 are 15 times more likely to die, 14 times more likely to need to be intubated, and 22 times more likely to have pre-term birth than those who are uninfected, according to a study published this month in JAMA Network Open [see citation below]. "I have not seen risks like this," said Linda Eckert, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Washington.

Reluctance to get the shots has been widespread among the pregnant population because they were excluded from clinical trials for the Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Studies on pregnant women began in February [2021], and evidence has shown no increased risk of miscarriage from the shots. US health officials this month [August 2021] stepped up calls for pregnant people to get vaccinated. "Now we have a lot more compelling data about the safety of the vaccine in pregnancy, and we have amazingly compelling data about how dangerous it is to get COVID when you're pregnant," Eckert said.

The low numbers of pregnant people who are vaccinated and the delta variant have "created this perfect storm of pregnant people getting extremely sick and being hospitalized, and even requiring care in the intensive care unit," said Alison Cahill, a professor of women's health at the University of Texas at Austin Dell Medical School and maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the school's Women's Health Institute. "We have very, very busy services with patients extremely sick from COVID."

Vaccine worries

[G N-M], who is 6 months pregnant and lives in New York City, got her 1st vaccine dose after the end of the 1st trimester of her pregnancy after initially worrying about harming her unborn child. However, she also was concerned about exposing her immuno-compromised mother to the virus and "did not want to be in a hospital and not be vaccinated," she said. "That really scared me."

Judette Louis, chair of the University of South Florida College of Medicine Obstetrics and Gynecology, said the vast majority of pregnant people getting hospitalized with COVID are unvaccinated.

"We did have a couple of vaccine breakthroughs that did end up needing to be hospitalized, but they did not end up on the ventilator," Louis said.

People often undergo immune changes during pregnancy that can increase vulnerability to a severe type of COVID, potentially with respiratory issues, said Shweta Patel, an obstetrician and gynecologist in Florida.

In the study published in JAMA, University of California, Irvine, doctors and a statistician analyzed a clinical database of more than 650 academic hospitals in the US to compare patients who gave birth with or without COVID-19 between 1 Mar 2020 and 28 Feb 2021.

Of those cases, 5.2% of those giving birth with COVID were admitted to the ICU, compared with 0.9% of women without the virus; 1.5% of those with COVID were intubated, compared with 0.1% of women without the virus. Additionally, 16.4% of women with COVID delivered at less than 37 weeks, compared with 11.5% of those without the virus.

"Sometimes the illness can be significant enough such that we have to deliver folks early, and when that happens, then that newborn baby who's delivered extremely prematurely takes on all of the risks of a very preterm delivery that can be lifelong morbidities and even death," Cahill said.

Immune systems

Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles has seen a lot of pregnant people admitted to the ICU throughout the pandemic, said Nida Qadir, associate director of the hospital's medical ICU. It is one of the few facilities in the Los Angeles area that can put patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a machine that bypasses the heart and lungs to allow the body to heal.

Now that there are more cases overall, there are even more pregnant COVID patients in her ICU.

People who have to deliver early and end up on ECMO have a "long course to recovery," said South Florida College's Louis. Taking care of severely ill COVID-19 patients can be more challenging if they're pregnant. One important way to help patients in respiratory distress involves putting someone on their belly, known as proning. "While we're able to do it, it for obvious reasons becomes more difficult if somebody is further along in their pregnancy," Qadir said.

Doctors also need to keep oxygen levels higher for pregnant patients because "we are trying to keep in mind oxygen delivery to the fetus, which is very sensitive to changes in oxygenation," Qadir said.

Premature birth

Qadir took care of one young woman who had an uncomplicated pregnancy and was athletic prior to getting COVID. The woman had to deliver her baby prematurely, "nearly died so many times," and was in the hospital for months before she was able to go home.

"We cannot predict who is going to have that severe COVID pneumonia respiratory failure outcome," said Christopher Robinson, chair of obstetrics and gynecology and director of maternal fetal medicine at East Cooper Medical Center in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. "The only thing that appears to be suggestive of who is safe and who is not is vaccination
history."

"This retrospective cohort study found that women with COVID-19 giving birth had higher rates of mortality, intubation, ICU admission, and preterm birth than women without COVID-19."

From the CDC: "Clinicians have seen the number of pregnant people infected with COVID-19 rise in the past several weeks. The increased circulation of the highly contagious delta variant, the low vaccine uptake among pregnant people, and the increased risk of severe illness and pregnancy complications related to COVID-19 infection among pregnant people make vaccination for this population more urgent than ever."

[2] Pfizer vaccine
[A] FDA approval
Date: Mon 23 Aug 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/08/pfizer-covid-vaccine-gains-full-fda-approval


Earlier today [Mon 23 Aug 2021], the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer-BioNTech full approval, a milestone in the ongoing pandemic.

Though the vaccine has been used under an emergency use authorization (EUA) since last December [2020], a full approval allows more businesses, schools, and organizations to mandate vaccine use among employees and students and offers legitimacy to a vaccine some people believe has been rushed through safety evaluations and protocols.

"While this and other vaccines have met the FDA's rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the 1st FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product," said Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock, MD, in a press statement. [https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine]

"While millions of people have already safely received COVID-19 vaccines, we recognize that for some, the FDA approval of a vaccine may now instill additional confidence to get vaccinated. Today's [23 Aug 2021] milestone puts us one step closer to altering the course of this pandemic in the US."

Pfizer's vaccine, which is administered in 2 doses 3 weeks apart, will still be under an EUA for recipients ages 12-15, and for immunocompromised individuals who qualify for a 3rd dose of the vaccine 28 days after their 2nd dose.

The FDA said it reviewed hundreds of pages of clinical study results and drug trial documentation before the approval, including details of a trial of 20 000 vaccine and 20 000 placebo recipients ages 16 and older who did not have evidence of the COVID-19 virus infection within a week of receiving the 2nd dose. The FDA said 12 000 vaccine recipients have been followed-up for at least 6 months.

Following the announcement, the Pentagon said it was moving to make the vaccine mandatory for all 1.4 million active-duty troops, and several major universities and school districts announced vaccine mandates as well.

In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio said all 148 000 public school teachers and staff will be required to be vaccinated with at least one dose by 27 Sep [2021]. Before FDA approval, the mayor said either vaccination or weekly testing was required for school staff.

While FDA approval makes mandates easier, it also makes it legal to give the vaccine off-label. Today the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) called for a completion of clinical trials of the vaccine in children ages 6 months and up before use in young children.

"The clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine in children ages 11 years old and younger are underway, and we need to see the data from those studies before we give this vaccine to younger children," said AAP President Lee Savio Beers, MD, FAAP in a statement. "The dose may be different for younger ages. The AAP recommends against giving the vaccine to children under 12 until authorized by the FDA."

The AAP still recommends the vaccine be used in all children 12 and up.

Florida has joined Texas and California as the 3rd state in the country to breach 3 million COVID-19 cases, as a summer surge fielded by the delta (B1617.2) variant continues to cause a spike in activity in the state.

The state reported a new high in COVID-19 deaths, with 1486 in the past week, nearly 15% above the previous record. According to USA Today, Orlando's largest healthcare system reported 1620 patients currently hospitalized, twice as many as last winter's peak.

The United States reported 36 692 new COVID-19 cases yesterday and 200 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases]

The 7-day average of new daily cases is 140 264, according to the Washington Post tracker. New daily cases rose 7.7% in the past week, while hospitalizations climbed 10.0% and deaths skrocketed by 47.2%. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic]

As states battle increasing cases, demand for antibody treatments has also increased, especially in Texas, Florida, and Louisiana, according to the Associated Press. White House officials reported recently that federal shipments of the drugs increased fivefold last month, to nearly 110 000 doses. [https://apnews.com/article/health-coronavirus-pandemic-ad87808ad28f29c6cb5f1b98e478c6db]

The treatment, most commonly Regeneron's dual-antibody cocktail, is used in people with mild to moderate symptoms who are not hospitalized but are at risk for serious disease.

In related news, the FDA issued a warning over the weekend against the use of ivermectin to treat or prevent COVID-19. The drug prevents parasites in farm animals, but some people have experimented with taking the drug to prevent the coronavirus. [https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19]

Late last week, Mississippi's health department issued an alert saying its poison control center is receiving calls from people experiencing symptoms after ingesting livestock ivermectin. [https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/resources/15400.pdf]

"Animal drugs are highly concentrated for large animals and can be highly toxic in humans," the health department warned. "Some of the symptoms associated with ivermectin toxicity include rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, neurologic disorders, and potentially severe hepatitis requiring hospitalization."

["Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine becomes 1st to win FDA's full approval, paving the way for boosters, mandates.

"Eight months after authorizing the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in the USA, the Food and Drug Administration issued its full stamp of approval."

"The FDA decision clears the way for the companies to market their vaccine, which is not permitted without full licensure. It may launch a race for booster shots, allowing doctors to prescribe extra Pfizer-BioNTech shots 'off label' to anyone they think should get one."

"The review of the 340 000-page license application was completed in just 97 days by FDA staff working 'night and day,' said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, which approves vaccines. 'We completed this in about 40% of the normal clock time for a submission of this magnitude,' he said."

"The companies have manufactured more than 2 billion doses, more than 200 million of which were administered in the USA, the most of any of the 3 vaccines allowed for use in the country." (https://news.yahoo.com/pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-becomes-133825011.html) - Mod.LK]

https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/u-s-vaccine-mandates-grow-indonesia-eases-curbs-virus-update-1.1643459?fr=operanews


Vaccination requirements were set in the US by a wide swath of groups -- from companies such as Chevron Corp. to New York City schools to the Pentagon -- after regulators gave full approval to the vaccine made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. President Joe Biden called on companies to mandate shots for workers.

The move is also expected to sway holdouts in the Black and Hispanic communities. Meanwhile, the 7-day average death toll in the U.S. topped 1000 on 2 straight days for the 1st time since March [2021].

In Asia, Indonesia eased some restrictions, but an official said some curbs will remain as long as the pandemic persists.

The positive test rate jumped in Lagos as Nigeria's commercial hub faces a 3rd wave of the virus. France may begin administering a 3rd dose for the elderly early next month [September 2021].

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said current measures in place to curb the virus remain sufficient.

Key developments:

- Global Tracker: Cases top 212 million; deaths pass 4.4 million
- Vaccine Tracker: More than 4.95 billion doses administered
- COVID optimists see US nearing delta peak, but risks abound
- Pregnant, unvaccinated, and intubated: Case surge alarms doctors
- Pfizer FDA approval more likely to sway Black, Hispanic holdouts
- Tokyo's COVID playbook offers a lesson for Beijing 2022 Olympics
