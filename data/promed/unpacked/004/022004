TEARS Animal Rescue says there has been an increase in cases of feline panleukopenia, a fatal viral disease affecting cats. Unvaccinated animals have a mortality rate of up to 90%. Any unvaccinated cat is susceptible, especially community and homeless cats that live in colonies.

Dr Tania Heuer, head veterinarian at TEARS: "Because of the high contagiousness and mortality rate of the disease, animals that contract and show symptoms of the disease have to be euthanised. Symptoms of the virus include loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhoea, dehydration, and high fever."

Heuer says the prognosis for cats that are malnourished and have weak immune systems is extremely poor as they are likely to pass away within 12-24 hours. She's urging cat owners not to be complacent about the virus.

Due to the infectious nature of the virus, an outbreak in the Western Cape is inevitable if nothing is done to curb its spread. "Currently, we're seeing more and more cases from communities in the Deep South, Cape Flats, and Southern Suburbs, including Diep River and Constantia. The only way to curb the spread is by vaccination."

[Feline panleukopenia (FP) is a highly contagious viral disease of cats caused by the feline parvovirus. The disease, also called feline distemper or feline parvo, was in the past a leading cause of death in cats. Today, it is an uncommon disease in industrialized countries, due mainly to the availability and use of effective vaccines. Vaccination is equally important for strictly indoor cats as well as indoor/outdoor cats because the virus is everywhere in the environment. Most young kittens receive their 1st vaccination when 6-8 weeks of age; follow-up vaccines are given until the kitten is around 16 weeks of age. Adult vaccination schedules vary with the age and health of the cat, as well as the risk of FP in the area.

A comprehensive review of feline panleukopenia is available in Mod.TG's commentary in post 20210212.8186548. - Mod.AS
