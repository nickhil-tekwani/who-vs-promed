3 more die of food poisoning
-----------------
3 more people died on Fri, 26 Mar 2004, bringing the number of fatalities
to 8 following a recent food poisoning incident in the East Nusa Tenggara
regency of Sikka. On the same day, 6 others were still being treated at
the TC Hillers Hospital in Maumere, the capital of Sikka regency.
Doctors have not been able to determine the exact cause of the incident,
but preliminary investigations appeared to show that the outbreak could be
traced back to fish. 5 of the 8 fatalities died quickly after they ate
cooked fish on Mon, 22 Mar 2004, while 3 others died in the hospital on Fri
26 Mar 2004.
The 8 victims ranged from 40 down to 5 years of age and were residents of
Semparong subdistrict in Maumere.
Ignatius H. Keron, the head of the Sikka health agency, said that the
agency had taken urine samples from the victims and these had been sent to
a laboratory in Bali in order to enable the precise cause of the incident
to be determined.

[ProMED would appreciate more information about this episode. Without
knowledge of the timing from ingestion to the onset of symptoms, the
variety of fish eaten, and the manifestations of illness, it is difficult
to speculate on the etiology -- whether infection, biotoxin, or poison. -
