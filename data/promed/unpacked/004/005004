Danish authorities said on Friday [2 Oct 2020] that as many as one million mink will have to be culled after coronavirus infections were found among animals at farms that breed the creatures for their fur.

Denmark is the largest producer of mink in the world and had earlier culled animals at farms hit by the pandemic.

Fresh outbreaks have been recorded at 41 mink farms, and another 20 are suspected to be infected, totaling up to one million mink, said the ministry of Environment and Food in a statement.

Mink in farms within a radius of 8 km of an infected farm will also be culled as a precaution.

"My main focus is on ensuring that the mink farms do not become an infection risk for people, and, therefore, the government has decided to cull the mink," Food Minister Mogens Jensen said.

Denmark will cull around one million mink after finding further coronavirus infections among the animals at farms that breed them for their fur, authorities said.

The Nordic country is the world's largest producer of mink and had previously culled animals on farms hit by infections, but outbreaks have persisted.

Fresh cases have been registered at 41 mink farms, and another 20 were believed affected, totaling up to one million minks, Environment and Food Minister Mogens Jensen said at a press briefing on Thursday [1 Oct 2020] evening.

The Netherlands reported a similar outbreak and undertook a cull after 2 people were reported to have been infected by mink, though such cases of animal-to-human transmission are believed to be extremely rare.

There have also been occasional cases of zoo animals and house pets coming down with the coronavirus during the global pandemic, with their owners the likely cause of infection.

[During the previous phases of the event on Denmark's mink farms, with a monitoring strategy and strict restrictions for infected mink farms, the Danish veterinary services (DVFA) and the Danish health authorities assessed that it was justifiable to let infected holdings live because the risk of spreading infection to humans was seen as minimal. This policy has apparently changed.

On Thu 1 Oct 2020, Denmark's Chief Veterinary Officer, Dr Hanne Larsen, submitted to the OIE the 4th update on the COVID-19 situation in Denmark, underlining the addition of 23 infected mink farms since the previous 3rd update of 24 Aug 2020. The letter, submitted after the completion of the 3rd countrywide surveillance round implemented in 971 sampled and tested mink farms, includes its results and a table presenting the results of all 3 surveillance rounds. The letter is available at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/MM/Update_4_Letter_to_OIE_on_Sars-CoV-2_in_mink_farms_in_Denmark.pdf.

So far, 12 countries have reported to the OIE about the confirmation of COVID-19 in animals within their territories. In 4 of them, minks were named as affected; these were Netherlands, Spain, Denmark, and USA. Links to all incoming COVID-19 reports, and other information on the disease in animals, are available in OIE's COVID-19 Portal at https://www.oie.int/scientific-expertise/specific-information-and-recommendations/questions-and-answers-on-2019novel-coronavirus/events-in-animals/.
