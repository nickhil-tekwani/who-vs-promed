An Indonesian toddler who died this week has tested positive for avian
influenza after initial results were inconclusive, a Health Ministry
official said on Thu 19 Jan 2006. The boy's 13 year old sister died last
week after [having contracted] the H5N1 avian influenza virus, according to
local tests. Both cases still need to be confirmed by outside laboratories
recognised by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Their father was in hospital with suspected avian influenza, said Hariadi
Wibisono, the Ministry's director of control of animalborne diseases. "For
the boy in Indramayu, local tests show he died from avian influenza,"
Wibisono told Reuters. The boy and his sister are Indonesia's 5th cluster
of cases, where people living in close proximity have fallen ill. There has
been no evidence of human-to-human transmission in their deaths and dead
chickens were found in the neighbourhood around Indramayu, in West Java
province, officials have said. Indramayu is 175 km (110 miles) east of
Jakarta. Their father had been hospitalised in the West Java city of
Bandung, Wibisono said, adding test results had not yet come back.
WHO-recognised laboratories have confirmed 12 deaths in Indonesia and 5
cases where patients have survived. Apart from the 2 Indramayu children,
Indonesia is awaiting confirmation of local tests that showed a 39 year old
man died of bird flu earlier this month.

[So far only 17 human cases of avian influenza virus infection have been
confirmed by an independent WHO reference laboratory. Therefore the
statement that there have been 5 clusters of cases in Indonesia may need to
be revised. Nonetheless, none of the putative clusters observed in
Indonesia appears so far to represent person-to-person transmission of
infection. - Mod.CP]
