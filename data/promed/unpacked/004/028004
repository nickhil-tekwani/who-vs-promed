Dixie Packers, Inc., a Madison, Fla., is voluntarily recalling 192,553
pounds of lunch meat products, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food
Safety and Inspection Service announced today. Today's action is in
addition to last week's recall of frank and hot dog products.
On October 23, the firm began voluntarily recalling one day's production of
franks suspected of being contaminated with _Listeria monocytogenes_
bacteria. Subsequent testing of products from other production dates
prompted the firm to expand the recall on October 30 to all hot dog and
frank products still in commerce. Testing of other products found 2 items
positive for _Listeria monocytogenes_, resulting in today's addition to the
recall of all lunch meat products produced on 2 production days. Subject to
recall are all sizes of the "W/D Brand" products with establishment numbers
and sell-by codes listed below:
"Salami"; "Est. 1415M"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Uneven Salami"; "Est. 1415M"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Spiced Luncheon"; "Est. 1415M"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Beef Bologna"; "Est. 1415M"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Uneven Beef Bologna"; "Est. 1415M"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Cooked Ham"; "Est. 1415M"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Chopped Ham"; "Est. 1415M"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Head Cheese"; "Est. 1415M"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Bologna"; "Est. P-6655"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Turkey Bologna"; "Est. P-6655"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Turkey Ham"; "Est. P-6655"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Pickle & Pimento"; "Est. P-6655"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Uneven Bologna"; "Est. P-6655"; Sell-by: "NOV 13 98" or "NOV 27 98"
"Wafer Ham"; "Est. 1415M"; Sell-by: "NOV 22 98" or "DEC 06 98"
"Wafer Beef"; "Est. 1415M"; Sell-by: "NOV 22 98" or "DEC 06 98"
"Wafer Chicken"; "Est. P-6655"; Sell-by: "NOV 22 98" or "DEC 06 98"
"Wafer Turkey"; "Est. P-6655"; Sell-by: "NOV 22 98" or "DEC 06 98"
Only the above listed products and sell-by dates are subject to recall.
However, to simplify the recall for consumers, the company will also take
back any of the above listed products with other sell-by date codes as well.
The products were distributed to Winn-Dixie Stores, which are located in
the following 14 states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky,
Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. Some of the franks were also distributed to
the Bahamas, where they may be found in other retail stores as well.
USDA initially discovered the problem after franks sampled from a
Tallahassee, Fla., retail store tested positive for _Listeria
monocytogenes_. Further testing prompted expansions of the recall. USDA
began withholding inspection at the plant yesterday; the plant will remain
closed while plant management evaluates and reassesses its production
processes and controls. The plant will need to provide FSIS with a
corrective action plan to control processes at the plant before inspection
is re-instituted. FSIS field and district enforcement personnel are
assisting the plant in its evaluation to determine how it can adjust its
processes and take appropriate corrective actions needed to prevent future
problems.
Consumers with questions about the recall may phone the toll-free USDA Meat
and Poultry Hotline at 1-800-535-4555. The hotline can be reached from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. (Eastern Time) Monday through Friday.
