Blast disease looms over paddy harvest
--------------------------------------
Harvest of [rice] has begun in canal irrigated areas of [Tiruchirappalli] district [Tamil Nadu] with farmers in some parts worried over possible yield loss because of blast disease. Paddy had been raised on about 85 000 acres [about 34 400 ha] in the canal irrigated delta areas and another 25 000 acres [about 10 100 ha] in non-delta areas.

Incidence of blast disease had been reported from [several] areas in the district. Farmers are apprehensive of a sharp drop in yield [which] will be badly affected in the disease-hit fields.

According to initial estimates, about 8000 hectares [about 19 800 acres] were affected in the district because of the disease. An assessment would be taken up in association with Tamil Nadu Agricultural University scientists, the Agriculture Department said.

[A local official] said that the Agriculture Department should take effective steps to prevent recurrence of the disease in future by recommending appropriate steps to eradicate the fungus from the fields.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously classified as a strain of _M. grisea_, synonym _Pyricularia oryzae_). It is one of the most destructive diseases of rice worldwide, with potential yield losses of more than 50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages, plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The fungus is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides and cultural practices but relies mainly on resistant varieties. However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence.
