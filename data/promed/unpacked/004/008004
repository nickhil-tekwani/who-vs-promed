[We asked Prof. Swanepoel for a followup on his experiments to determine, in
the light of the Congo-Crimean hemorrhagic fever outbreak affecting abbatoir
workers in S. Africa, how long ostriches are infectious. We are very
grateful to him for making the time in his busy schedule to give us the
following reply - Mod. JW

A paper has been submitted to Epidemiology and Infection and I am not quite
sure how that affects my presenting summaries elsewhere, but it may suffice
to say that we found demonstrable viremia up to day 4 post-inoculation and
virus in viscera up to day 5, and concluded that the arrival of infected
birds at abattoirs could be avoided by keeping them free of ticks for a
minimum period of 14 days before slaughter. This could be achieved by use of
modern pyrethroid acaricides which are highly effective and leave no residues
in tissues, together with holding the birds for the 14 days in a place/s
secured by suitable fencing from penetration by other hosts of ticks.
The same principles should be applied to sheep, cattle, goats and other
slaughter animals, but since viremia is of longer duration in these animals,
the holding period should probably be 21 days.
