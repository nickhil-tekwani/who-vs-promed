Comment
-------
What is curious is our experience that chickens in barnyards will convert,
while chickens in standard cages do not, even when traps placed a few yards
away produce multiple pools of virus-positive _Culex_ mosquitoes. After we
started seeing crows die, we were able to use them to lead us to "hot
spots." In those areas, we had no trouble finding positive mosquitoes.
Based on 2000, I think the key thing is to find those hot areas and
concentrate control there. Of course, 2001 may show a very different
picture. I would be especially cautious about extrapolating what we have
seen in the north east to areas where _Aedes (Ochelrotatus?) albopictus_ is
common. Our container breeders are not abundant, aggressive pests, for the
most part.
