This year's [2017] outbreak of wheat streak mosaic virus in Kansas was the worst since 2006, according to Kansas State University. The disease also struck parts of Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Colorado [in the] US Plains [region]. Kansas could face hefty yield losses from a virus that cost it nearly 6 per cent of production, valued at USD 76.8 million.

The virus is spread by mites that thrive on "volunteer wheat" that sprout from kernels left after harvest. Farmers need to kill those plants with herbicide 2 weeks before they plant the crop. Not enough farmers did so last year [2016]. Low [grain] prices may have discouraged growers from spending money to eradicate volunteer wheat. "If it happens again, there has got to be a monetary penalty attached," [a farmer] said.

The Kansas Wheat Commission, Kansas State University and the Kansas Department of Agriculture launched a campaign called "Stop the Streak" to educate farmers.

[_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_) can infect wheat, maize (some cultivars), grasses, as well as oats and barley in experimental inoculations. Heavy WSMV infection can cause complete crop failure in wheat. Symptoms usually appear in warmer weather and may include yellow blotches, streaks and mottling on leaves, as well as severe stunting, excessive tillering, and possibly death of plants. WSMV has also been reported as synergistic partner, in the Americas and Europe, to cause maize lethal necrosis (MLN) in co-infection with _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_, transmitted by chrysomelid beetles).

WSMV is spread by the wheat curl mite _Aceria tosichella_. Larvae acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants and remain infectious for approximately a week. Field distribution of symptoms is closely related to the dispersal of the vector; for example, margins of fields are often affected first. The virus is not transmitted congenitally to the progeny of the vector. WSMV can also be mechanically transmitted and seed transmitted at a low level. Control of the mite vector is difficult but disease management may include controlling volunteer wheat and grassy weeds to minimise inoculum from the previous season via a 'green bridge'.
