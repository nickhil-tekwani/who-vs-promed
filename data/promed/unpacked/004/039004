China's Ministry of Agriculture has issued another emergency notice
in response to the highly-pathogenic pig blue ear disease, requiring
the entire nation to further improve prevention and control efforts
and to invigorate prevention and control of highly pathogenic pig
blue ear disease, [thereby] advancing the continued healthy
development of pig production.
Sources say that from the beginning of this year [2007], highly
pathogenic pig blue ear disease has occurred in 25 provinces. As of
10 Jul 2007, 302 counties had been affected with 586 outbreaks,
including 143 221 infected and 39 455 dead pigs.
A comprehensive analysis shows that although overall national
conditions are still relatively stable, conditions in some locales,
especially provinces along the Yangtze River, are serious. With
continued high heat and humidity, it cannot be ruled out that
outbreaks will continue to develop in some places.
The notice points out that the animal epidemic is still severe and
that prevention and control tasks are extremely difficult and should
be a key priority, along with strengthened leadership, concentrated
energy, and no effort spared in the earnest implementation of all
prevention and control tasks to resolutely prevent and control highly
pathogenic pig blue ear disease from expanding and spreading, with
immunization at the core.
First in importance is a vigorous push on immunization work. Second
is to strengthen disinfection work on pig farms (households).
Large-scale farms, pig farming districts, and pig-raising households
should be actively guided in disease prevention management. At
present, special attention must be paid to hot-season disinfection
work to eliminate the source. Third is to strengthen control and
oversight of market distribution. Outbreak areas must be sealed off
and the trading of pigs suspended, with pigs and their related
products prohibited from leaving the outbreak area. Fourth is to
strengthen disease surveillance and reporting. Fifth is to promptly
and firmly handle emerging outbreaks.
The notice emphasizes that all prevention and control work should be
energetically undertaken. 1st is to conscientiously fix
responsibility for prevention and control. 2nd is to pursue
implementation in each village and township. 3rd is to increase
inspections. 4th is to manage outbreaks in strict accordance with the
law, following the "Animal Epidemic Prevention Law" and "Regulation
on Handling Major Animal Epidemic Emergencies," and to carry out
animal epidemic reporting. Concealment of reports and false reports
of animal outbreaks will all be strictly investigated in accordance
with relevant laws and regulations.

[This is a rather alarming description of the continued spread of the
porcine disease which has been spreading in China since the summer of
2006. Initially, the disease was named -- in the Chinese media -- as
"Swine High Fever Disease." The same terminology was also used in
China's notification to the OIE of 12 Sep 2006 (see archive
20060924.2732). During 2007, various descriptions and epidemiological
pieces of information became available and were published (see
refs.), some of them indicating that the disease had spread within 22
of China's provinces, causing havoc.
On 9 May 2007, the Chinese authorities notified the OIE of a new
outbreak in the village Laosi in the province Guandong, involving
fattening pigs reared in backyards and small-scale farms. It
specified that 1640 out of 2981 swine were affected; 331 died and 337
were reportedly destroyed. The report included the following
epidemiological comments: "Based on the experience of the similar
epidemic [that] occurred in 2006 in China, which was notified to the
OIE on 12 Sep 2006, this case is probably caused by highly pathogenic
PRRS virus. The laboratory diagnosis is ongoing." See
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=5387>.
The current information says that the disease has spread to an
additional 3 provinces, reaching 25. Clearly, the disease, which has
been recently regarded by the Chinese as "highly pathogenic pig blue
ear disease" (Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome, PRRS),
manifests exceptional infectivity, which -- combined with its
reported pathogenicity -- should be of concern on the international level.
An official OIE update will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
