_Globodera rostochiensis_, on potato, in Iran. BSPP New Disease Reports
2009 (Feb-Aug); 19]
---------------------------------------
In June 2008 a few ware potato fields in Hamadan Province in the western
part of Iran showed patches of about 20-200 square metres of poor growth.
Potato plants in these areas exhibited symptoms of severe stunting and
nutrient deficiency along with yellow leaves and wilting (figure 1 in URL
above: patches of infested potato field showing poor growth). Roots of
infested plants showed white, golden mature [nematode] females and brown
cysts on their surface (figure 2 in URL above: mature females and cysts of
potato cyst nematode, _Globodera rostochiensis_ on the root surface of
potato plant). Cysts and 2nd stage juveniles were extracted from soil and
root samples.

The morphological and morphometrical characters of 2nd stages juveniles and
perineal area of cysts were examined by light microscope. The cysts showed
the general characteristics of _Globodera_ genus -- that is, almost
spherical body without vulval cone, circumfenestrate opening of the
perineal area and subterminal anus. 2nd stage juveniles had stylets with
rounded knobs.

A molecular test [species specific polymerase chain reaction] was done. On
the basis of the results obtained the cysts were identified as _Globodera
rostochiensis_ [Wollenweber, 1923 (Behrens, 1975)]. The morphological
diagnosis was confirmed by amplifying a single fragment of 315 base pair
length. No amplification was produced with the specific primers for _G.
pallida_. Potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) are considered quarantine pests in
Iran and this is the first report of the genus _Globodera_ and _G.
rostochiensis_ from Iran.

[Both golden (_Globodera rostochiensis_, with at least 5 races) and pale
(_G. pallida_) potato cyst nematodes (PCNs) cause serious crop losses in
potato. They can also infect other solanaceous crops and weeds. Symptoms on
potato include stunting, yellowing, and wilting of leaves as well as a
reduced root system. Damage to the crop varies from small patches of poor
growing plants to complete crop failure. Diseased plants first occur in
isolated patches and these become larger with each new crop. In light
infestations, plants may show no above ground symptoms, but yield can be
reduced. Light infestations can reduce tuber size, whereas heavy
infestations reduce both number and size of tubers.

The nematodes are not greatly influenced by soil type and temperature. They
can survive in soil, in the absence of a host, for up to 20 years as cysts
containing viable eggs. Spread occurs via infected soil, water, wind, or on
plant material. It takes several years from introduction into a paddock
before PCN numbers reach a detectable level. Disease management includes
exclusion, crop rotation with non-host species, and use of crop cultivars
resistant to specific PCN races. Both PCNs have been included on the alert
list of the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO).
