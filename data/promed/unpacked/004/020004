Three among 12 674 tissue samples test variant CJD positive
-----------------------------------------------------------
Researchers at Plymouth's Derriford Hospital and the Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease Surveillance Unit tested 12 674 appendix and tonsil samples. 3
showed signs of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated as CJD (new
var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail]. Extrapolating their findings to the whole
population, they estimated that 3800 Britons may harbour the disease. These
findings are published in the Journal of Pathology.
A total of 141 people have died from vCJD in the UK since the disease
emerged in 1995. Scientists have been suggesting that the number of deaths
from the disease had peaked. A recent study by researchers at Imperial
College London predicted the disease would claim fewer than 540 lives.
The scientists who carried out this latest study said their findings "need
to be interpreted with caution. There is still much to learn about vCJD and
presence of the protein in these tissue samples does not necessarily mean
that those affected will go on to develop vCJD," said lead researcher David
Hilton. Professor James Ironside of the National CJD Surveillance Unit in
Edinburgh said the findings suggest some people could carry the disease
without ever showing any symptoms. But he added: "I think the findings do
have to be taken seriously. Generally, one has to be cautious about
interpreting these data, but they may indicate that there are people who
are not infected in the normal way but could represent a source of infection."
"I find these results very concerning," said Professor John Collinge, head
of the MRC Prion Unit at St Mary's Hospital, in London. "Our experience is
that looking at appendix samples will underestimate the true picture." He
suggested the government should look again at whether surgeons should use
disposable instruments in operations where there may be a risk of
transmission, such as the removal of tonsils. A Department of Health
spokesman said it had "already put in place measures to reduce any risk of
possible transmission of the disease via blood products and surgical
instruments."
Meanwhile, the Health Protection Agency is in the process of collecting 100
000 tonsil samples which will be tested for signs of vCJD. "The larger
scale of the study should provide better estimates of the number of people
who may be affected," said Professor Pat Troop, its chief executive.
The study comes as the Medical Research Council told BBC News Online that a
long-awaited trial to test potential treatments for vCJD could start within
weeks. It will examine whether an anti-psychotic called quinacrine or an
unlicensed drug called pentosan polysulphate can help people with the
disease. Both have shown some promise in patients.

UK scientists fear thousands may be variant CJD carriers
--------------------------------------------------------
Thousands of people may unwittingly be carrying the agent responsible for
the human form of mad cow disease, according to research by British
scientists, media reports said on Fri 21 May 2004. The scientists calculate
that around 4000 people in Britain could be carrying the prion protein
responsible for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease [abbreviated as CJD (new
var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail], the reports said, citing a UK
government-funded study in the Journal of Pathology.
Scientists examined more than 12 500 appendices and tonsils removed in the
late 1990s from people in the highest-risk group, mainly aged in their 20s.
3 of the samples tested positive for vCJD. Dr David Hilton, one of the
authors of the study, calculated that this would suggest that 3800 people
in Britain could be carrying the infective agent. Hilton said the estimate
should be treated with caution, particularly as 2 of the 3 positive samples
appear different from those taken from confirmed vCJD victims.
But Professor John Collinge, head of the Medical Research Council's Prion
Unit, said the results were "very concerning". "Thankfully the numbers of
people who have developed variant CJD has been relatively small. But we
don't know how many people are infected," he told BBC radio. "There is a
concern that individuals who are incubating the disease, who themselves
don't show any evidence of the disease, could still pose a risk to others,
if they were blood donors, or if they had an operation which involved
instruments contacting infected tissues," he added.
There have been 141 definite or probable deaths from vCJD in Britain, at a
current rate of around 20 deaths a year. In March Britain banned people who
had had transfusions over the past 24 years from donating blood to reduce
the risk of spreading the disease. vCJD was first linked to eating beef
infected with Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease,
in 1996.

[These findings are alarming because there has been a marked decline in the
monthly incidence of confirmed vCJD cases in the UK since the beginning of
2004, and it has been suggested that the epidemic may have passed its peak.
The results of the tonsil and appendix tissue survey suggest, on the other
hand, that there may be a substantial number of carriers of vCJD in younger
age groups in the UK. However, the observation that 2 of the 3 positive
results had atypical features makes these results difficult to evaluate at
this stage. A larger study of randomly selected tissue samples is in
prospect, having been delayed by consideration of ethical issues and
concern over patient consent. - Mod.CP]
