The following two news items highlight the vulnerability of the Asian
continent to yellow fever.
Asia is full of dengue, which is carried by the same mosquito, _Aedes
aegypti_, that transmits yellow fever in urban settings in the endemic
zones of Africa & South America. It is not known why yellow fever has not
yet spread there, but the time is surely coming, since sick people now
travel by air quickly between continents. In 1996, 2 unvaccinated tourists
fell ill in the Amazon, flew home to Switzerland & the USA respectively,
and died there of yellow fever. If that can happen in Europe & North
America, it can happen in Asia.
Now it appears -- see below -- that vaccination certificates issued by at
least one Asian country may not be valid, & that even in Europe there may
be interruptions in the vaccine supply.
WHO holds a stockpile of, I believe, 250,000 doses, and the WHO-approved
yellow fever vaccine centers around the world could gear up production
quickly in an emergency, but it is clear that a major effort will be needed
to protect Asia's millions in the event of an epidemic.
We would welcome comments on this situation - Mod.JW

Action launched against elements issuing bogus vaccination certificates
-------------------------------------------------------------------
LAHORE, Pakistan: The federal government after taking serious note of
issuance of fictitious and invalid vaccination certificates especially for
yellow fever, has launched a vigorous nationwide crackdown against
unscrupulous elements indulging in this practice.
Dr. Muhammad Tahir Sajjad, in charge Airport Health Department, said here
on Monday that the government has initiated strict action against
undesirable city travel agents and their staff, who reportedly issue
invalid and fictitious vaccination certificates bearing the stamps of local
health department, after fleecing heavy amount from gullible travellers.
He said that Airport Health Department, on the special directives of the
Federal Health Minister Jawed Hashmi was strictly checking vaccination
certificates carried by the passengers prior to their departure abroad.
The Federal Ministry of Health has provided sufficient stock of yellow
fever, meningitis vaccine at Lahore Airport for passengers proceeding
abroad.
Persons intending to visit Saudi Arabia and Central Asian countries need to
obtain vaccination against meningitis, while passengers travelling to
African and South American countries require yellow fever vaccination.

For the past few weeks yellow fever vaccine has not been available in the
UK owing to a production failure. This has created problems for travellers
wanting to head off this week [to destinations where yellow fever is
endemic.
Being vaccinated against yellow fever is not just a matter of common sense
but in certain countries a mandatory requirement for entry.
You need not only the vaccination but an official certificate to prove it.
Even then, there is no guarantee that border guards will accept it. In
extreme cases they might insist that you be immunised there and then at the
border -- with needles you cannot be sure are sterile -- and charge you for
the service.
The reason is simple. Yellow fever is both highly contagious and has no
specific cure. It is primarily a disease of monkeys, which live in the
rainforest canopies in sub-Saharan Africa and South America, and is
transmitted by mosquitoes. Occasionally, people working in or around the
forested areas may be bitten by a mosquito and contract yellow fever.
The biggest risk to public health occurs when such an infected person makes
his or her way back into the local town or city and is bitten by the urban
_Aedes_ mosquito, which then becomes infected.
Three to six days after being bitten you develop a fever, chills, abdominal
pain and vomiting. Jaundice may follow and later a bleeding disorder that
can lead to haemorrhage and, ultimately, to death.
The stringent regulations regarding vaccination are designed not to protect
travellers from the disease but to prevent them from carrying it into a
country.
[However, vaccination *will* save you from death, has no side effects, & is
valid for 10 years - Mod.JW
If you need the certificate, the vaccine must be given 10 days before you
intend to enter the country and at a [WHO certified yellow fever centre.
If you can't get the vaccination, you will need an exemption certificate.
In that event you must take your own sterile needles and syringes in case
you are faced with the possibility of being immunised at a border.
