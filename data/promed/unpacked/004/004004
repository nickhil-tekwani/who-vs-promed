Turkey: A Third Sibling from the Same Family Dies of Avian Influenza
--------------------------------------------------------------------
VAN: A third child from the same family died of avian influenza at a
hospital within a week in this eastern Turkish city on Friday [6 Jan 2006],
doctors said.
Health authorities are closely monitoring the H5N1 virus, fearing it could
mutate into a form easily passed between humans and spark a pandemic
killing tens of millions. Birds in Turkey, Romania, Russia and Croatia have
recently tested positive for the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu.
An 11 year old girl, died only a day after her 15-year-old sister succumbed
to the disease on Thursday [5 Jan 2006]. Their brother, age 14, died on
Sunday [1 Jan 2006]. Preliminary tests on the body of the boy pointed to a
strain [the H5N1 avian influenza virus] scientists fear could trigger a
global human epidemic. Samples from the boy tested positive by two
laboratories in Turkey and specimens were sent to centers in Britain, where
the initial test results could be checked.
Guenael Rodier, a special adviser on communicable diseases at WHO's
European headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark, said Thursday that they were
unlikely dealing with false positives for the deadly H5N1 strain. A team of
officials from the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture
Organization were expected to arrive in Turkey on Friday [6 Jan 2006] to
assess the situation.
Around 25 people were being treated for possible avian influenza virus
infection symptoms at the hospital in Van early Friday, as authorities from
the health and agriculture ministries attempted to manage more outbreaks
across the east of Turkey. New bird flu cases in fowl were detected in five
areas in eastern and southeastern Turkey and authorities have culled 7000
fowl in those areas, Agriculture Minister Mehdi Eker said Thursday [5 Jan
2006].
In Istanbul, the biggest city in Turkey, authorities immediately took four
pigeons, found dead near a mosque, to a lab for bird flu tests and sprayed
the area with disinfectants, the municipality said in a statement late
Thursday, wwhich the Anatolia news agency reported early Friday.
Dr. Ahmet Faik Oner, who treated the children, said the youngsters most
likely contracted bird flu while playing with dead chickens, explaining why
their parents were not affected. The children reportedly had tossed chicken
heads around like balls inside their house. The siblings from the eastern
town of Dogubayazit were hospitalized last week after developing high
fevers, coughing and bleeding in their throats. According to reports, the
Kocyigit family took their fowl inside the house when temperatures fell at
night and killed and ate the chickens when the [birds became] sick.
Most of the sick came from the town of Dogubayazit, around 200 kilometers
(120 miles) from Van, the last large town in Turkey before the Iranian
border. Two teenage children from Dogubayazit have died of bird flu this
week. All the patients were being treated at Van 100th Yil Hospital in the
east of the country. Another 25-30 people had come in for blood tests,
received medical care and left, and one was on life support, the hospital
official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity, saying he wasn't
authorized to speak to the press. Other doctors in contact with patients
were not reachable early Friday morning. In October [2005], Turkey
successfully contained an outbreak of the H5N1 virus in the western town of
Kiziksa, after culling more than 10 000 fowl. But in eastern Turkey, almost
every house has fowl and they allow them to go inside their houses at
night, aggravating the problem, according to Eker.
