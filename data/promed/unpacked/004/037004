Amphibian plague
----------------
Tiger salamanders show few symptoms of infection until they are dying. It's
no secret that amphibians have been having a hard time of it lately. They
are declining worldwide, but exactly what's killing them -- ultraviolet
light from an eroded ozone layer? pesticides run amok? a deadly fungus? --
is unclear. A new study adds another, unexpected possible culprit:
fishermen toting store-bought salamanders as bait for largemouth bass may
be unwittingly transporting a lethal disease from pond to pond.
When scores of tiger salamanders started going belly up in cattle watering
holes statewide, ecologist Jim Collins of Arizona State University teamed
with doctoral student James Jancovitch to investigate. They identified the
cause of death as an iridovirus, similar to a virus that afflicts frogs.
The surprise came when the scientists performed a genetic analysis of the
iridoviruses from similar die-offs all around the Rocky Mountains. Some
closely related viruses turned up at far-flung sites in Arizona and Canada,
while distantly related viruses appeared among dead salamanders recovered
from within a single pond.
The pattern was so strange, it seemed as though the animals could fly. And
maybe in a sense they did -- in the bait buckets of fishermen. Collins and
Jancovitch examined salamanders from a Phoenix bait shop and found viral
strains similar to those killing salamanders in Colorado.
"Salamanders being moved around as bait are functioning like Typhoid Mary,"
Collins says.
If his theory proves true, Collins has a good solution: Do not transport a
bait salamander any farther than the creature can walk.
