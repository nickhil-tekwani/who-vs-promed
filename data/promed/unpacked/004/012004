[2] Security concerns
- Thu 11 Oct 2018. Outbreak in war zone
[Huffington Post, abridged, edited]
https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ebola-outbreak-worsens-congo_us_5bb534d6e4b0876eda9ac7dc


Experts said a war zone Ebola outbreak would be a nightmare. It's been even worse. A surge in patients. Attacks against health workers. Money running out.

After a surge of 27 additional Ebola cases in the last 5 days in the Democratic Republic of Congo, global health leaders are growing increasingly concerned that the deadly outbreak could spread beyond their reach.

Experts are blaming the sharp jump in cases -- which had previously slowed to about 10 a week -- on an uptick in rebel and mob violence in the outbreak's new epicenter of Beni. In recent days, angry community protests and continued local resistance have frequently brought the efforts of emergency health responders to a standstill.

"We said from the beginning this is probably the most difficult context with which [we've] ever had to respond to an Ebola outbreak, and we stand by that assessment," said Dr Peter Salama, the World Health Organization's emergency response chief.

Most concerning, an estimated 70 percent of the 27 new cases were not known contacts, said Ray Arthur, the co-lead of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Ebola coordination team. That means the emergency response team could be losing track of chains of transmission in the community, he said.

"It's almost been a daily occurrence over the last couple weeks that we've lost hours and days of various teams [due to an] inability to access the people they need to access," Salama said. "This is now a very different kind of community response, directly tied in with communities being incredibly frustrated that the national and international and regional communities have been unable to ensure over decades their physical security."

That frustration -- at the lack of safety and security compounded with the sudden foreign international presence over a disease the area has never seen before -- has boiled over into violence against healthcare workers.

"Most of the times people do not get hurt but the material, like cars, get damaged," a spokesperson for the ministry of health said. "The rebel violence ignites social tensions in the community that then affects our efforts. When people feel unsafe because of rebel attacks, they stop caring about our health messages."

As one community health worker said in a report published in The Lancet [https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32419-X], "Ebola kills, but the rebels kill more."

The violence also affects Ebola patients. People feel unsafe leaving their own homes to seek treatment or still don't trust the authorities, which has resulted in several "community deaths" in recent days -- meaning people who died at home rather than in a contained medical facility, potentially exposing their families to the disease and spreading it into the community.

In light of the growing resistance and threats of violence, the DRC issued an urban decree in Beni on [Tue 9 Oct 2018]. It ordered that law enforcement teams escort the safe burial teams; that families obtain a death certificate before receiving a burial permit; that all health professionals refer Ebola cases to the authorities or risk losing their ability to practice medicine of any kind; and that anyone hiding Ebola patients face potential jail time.

As of yet, no one has been arrested, the Ministry of Health told HuffPost. But such severe actions, while meant to curtail resistance and decisions to hide family members, could have the opposite effect, Love said.

"I think there is a lot of controversy around this," she said. "It'll probably scare people and so they'll run into the forest."

According to Salama, the current emergency health response needs more money -- the latest estimate was USD 33 million, of which the WHO has secured USD 8 million in commitments -- as well as more security and more staff, especially senior epidemiologists, and logistics managers.

For [Dr Thomas Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security], the perfect people for the job would be the CDC and the US Agency for International Development's Disaster Assistance Response Team -- both of which have been deployed to DRC, but are far away in the nation's capital or across the border shoring up defenses in the neighboring countries of Uganda or Rwanda, where there is a high risk of regional spread.

"This outbreak is occurring in a really highly insecure environment, which complicates the response," a state department official told HuffPost when asked why the teams had yet to be deployed to the current epicenter. "The U.S. is committed to do its part to help save lives the best we can."

Inglesby and [Jeremy Konyndyk, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development] both argued that the proper security arrangements should be made so that these highly trained US resources would be able to execute what they do best.

"It's time to consider it anew. It'd be valuable to bring resources in sooner rather than later," Inglesby said. "It does seem like this is a time for potential intervention where things can go either way."

[Rapporteur Mary Marshall has selected highlights from the full report, shown above, but the whole article is well worth reading. This is an excellent summary, from many perspectives and organizations, of the current security situation in the eastern DRC. It addresses the anger over the increase in cases, the lack of trust in the community, and the urgent need to bring in more resources now, before the outbreak reaches a state out of control. - Mod.LK]

- Sun 14 Oct 2018. Background: Ebola experts from CDC were pulled from outbreak zone amid security concern
[STAT news, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/14/cdc-withdrew-ebola-experts-outbreak-zone/


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] was forced to withdraw its Ebola experts from an outbreak zone in the Democratic Republic of the Congo several weeks ago amid heightened security concerns, a decision that is fueling worry over the impact on efforts to contain the epidemic, according to US officials and public health experts familiar with the matter.

The Ebola experts -- among the most experienced on the planet -- and other US government employees have been told by the State Department that they cannot travel to eastern DRC to help with the on-the-ground response.

As a result, Dr Pierre Rollin -- a fixture of Ebola responses for decades -- has been consigned to the capital, Kinshasa, more than 1000 miles [about 1610 km] away, where he is advising the ministry of health. Other CDC staffers are helping DRC's eastern neighbors beef up their health security operations and prepare in other ways in case Ebola spreads across DRC's borders. Some have been detailed to the World Health Organization's Geneva headquarters.

A number of other organizations -- Doctors Without Borders [MSF], the International Federation of the Red Cross [IFRC], the nonprofit medical group Alima [Alliance for International Medical Action] -- are also assisting the effort to contain the virus.

But the CDC has expertise the response teams need, said Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health.

"CDC has responded to nearly 2 dozen filovirus outbreaks in its history and has people who've been working on these issues for 30 years. It doesn't make sense to have those people hundreds or thousands of miles away from where the disease is actually spreading," Inglesby said.

"It would provide a lot of value to have experienced leaders at CDC who've been in the situation before contributing what they can to the larger effort. I think it's an important moment to think about that," he said.

A handful of CDC officials were sent to eastern DRC early in the response to the epidemic, which began to spread in July [2018]. The agency's director, Dr Robert Redfield, briefly visited the region in August, stopping at the response headquarters in the city of Beni.

But the region is effectively a war zone, with over 1 million displaced people and scores of armed rebel groups that wage battle against government troops. An attack on UN peacekeepers in late August [2018] led to an order for US staff to withdraw from the outbreak zone.

Initially they were pulled back to Goma [North Kivu], a large city south of the area where the outbreak is occurring. What was initially thought to be perhaps a temporary situation has become the status quo.

Public health experts familiar with the discussions over whether to deploy US personnel to the outbreak zone said the decisions have been influenced by the long shadow of the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which killed a US ambassador and 3 other Americans.

"This outbreak is occurring in a highly insecure environment, which complicates public health response activities," a State Department official, who spoke on condition he not be named, said [Sun 14 Oct 2018].

It's unclear whether or when the US experts might be permitted to return to the outbreak zone. Talks are underway to determine whether they may safely do so, sources said.

"The United States remains committed to doing its part to help save lives and control the outbreak as quickly as possible. We continue to provide technical and financial resources to the DRC Government and the World Health Organization," the State Department officials said.

So far there have been 211 confirmed and probable cases in this outbreak, making it the 7th largest Ebola outbreak on record. Of the total number of cases, 135 have been fatal.

Some public health experts believe that, while the current conditions are indeed dangerous, an out-of-control Ebola outbreak in a war zone would be exponentially more hazardous -- and would ultimately require more US responders on the ground in circumstances of even greater peril.

"The risk isn't going to go away. And the risk of ... an Ebola outbreak that can't be stopped in that part of the world would be profound," Inglesby said.

Lessons from the disastrous West African outbreak of 2014-2015, which engulfed 3 countries and reached case counts previously thought to be impossible, should be applied here, he insisted.

"I think there's pretty wide agreement that if we'd been able to do more earlier, before the summer where things really took off, we may have been able to change the course of that outbreak," he said. "Early strong public health response is important in keeping things from getting ... out of hand and spiraling."

The West African outbreak, which took over 2 years to extinguish, mushroomed to nearly 30 000 cases, killing more than 11 000 people in the process. The early mishandling of the outbreak led to multiple commissions of inquiry and to the reorganization of the WHO's emergency response operation.

"We, the US, after the 2014-15 Ebola outbreak led the reorganization of WHO to put WHO in the lead so that they had surge capacity and ... the financial resources to get them out into the field right away, authority to overrule the regional and country offices and take the lead in these responses," noted Jimmy Kolker, a retired US diplomat with years of experience in Africa who is now a non-resident associate at the Center For Strategic and International Studies.

Kolker gave high marks to the efforts of the WHO, saying the revised emergency response system is working. But it relies, he said, on the global health body being able to call on assistance from national public health agencies. CDC experts should be on the ground in Eastern DRC, Kolker said.

The current outbreak is occurring in the province of North Kivu -- with some spillover into the neighboring Ituri province -- which is on the border with Uganda. Rwanda and South Sudan are close by.

By the time DRC recognized there was an Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, at the end of July [2018], there had already been 43 cases.

But a rapid response involving use of an experimental Ebola vaccine being developed by Merck created hopes that spread might be contained fairly quickly. From about 40 cases a week, the count dropped to about 10 a week in September [2018], Dr Mike Ryan, assistant director-general of the WHO's emergency preparedness and response program, said recently.

That progress, however, has been halted. There have been more infections confirmed in the 1st half of October than in the whole of September. And the WHO is now openly talking about a response operation that will drag into next year.

The DRC ministry of health reported 4 new cases [Sun 14 Oct 2018]. 3 were people who died in the community, meaning they were cared for when they were at their most infectious by loved ones who were not wearing the protective garb that prevents transmission.

Officials attribute the rebound in cases to a number of factors. In addition to security conditions making it difficult for responders to operate, community mistrust has led to vaccine refusal in some neighborhoods and the hiding of some infected people.

The longer the outbreak rages, the harder it will be to contain it, experts warn. In recent reports, the WHO and the ministry of health have acknowledged that "contract tracing" is falling behind. That's the process by which all people who might have been infected by a case are identified, offered vaccine, and monitored during the period in which infection might develop.

Contact tracing allows for the quick isolation of people who become sick. And it allows responders to keep tabs on where the virus is spreading. If contact tracing fails, responders will lose sight of where the virus is transmitting -- dangerous in any scenario and much more dangerous in a conflict zone.

"There is a clear risk to not getting involved," Inglesby warned. "The risk is that the Ebola outbreak spreads in a more dramatic way in conditions that are already dangerous and make it harder and harder to contain."

[Both security concerns and community distrust leading to vaccine resistance must be addressed, although it certainly isn't easy or simple. It would be preferable if strong protection could be provided to all responders when entering regions where armed conflict is occurring rather than shutting down operations in those areas. Suspension of contact tracing and vaccination leads to unimmunized potentially infectious individuals free to spread the virus, leading to even more cases. It is a very dangerous situation that can easily build to a tipping point where the virus is spreading out of control. Community distrust, an equally large problem, can only be addressed by continued intensive and regular communication with community leaders -- religious and political. The community must want to be involved so they feel invested in the outcome of this outbreak.

Loss of the CDC expertise is a significant setback, adding to the other problems that exist that led to their withdrawal. It's a loss that may seriously hamper the control effort. Fortunately, Doctors Without Borders, the International Federation of the Red Cross, Alima, and of course WHO, among other organizations, are continuing to offer assistance. This is a critical time and as much help as possible is needed to get ahead of this outbreak. - Mod.LK
