Poliomyelitis in Nigeria and West/Central Africa -- 18 Jun 2008
---------------------------------------------------------------
Northern Nigeria is currently affected by a new outbreak of wild
poliovirus type 1 (WPV1), which has begun to spread internationally.
In 2008, a 9-fold increase in new cases caused by this serotype has
been reported compared with the same period in 2007. This outbreak in
northern Nigeria has the potential to cause major international
outbreaks, as occurred in 2003-2006. This year [2008], Nigeria
accounts for 86 percent of WPV1 cases in the world.

This new outbreak in Nigeria has occurred because upwards of 20
percent of children remain unimmunized in key high-risk areas for
polio in the north of the country. From 2003 to 2006, an outbreak in
northern Nigeria led to national and international spread of the
disease, eventually re-infecting 20 previously polio-free countries,
causing outbreaks in places as far away as Indonesia and Yemen, and
resulting in 1475 cases in these 20 countries.

New WPV1 genetically linked to viruses from northern Nigeria has now
been confirmed in Benin (one case, onset 17 Apr 2008) and the western
part of Niger (one case, in Tillaberry province, close to the borders
with Burkina Faso and Mali; onset 11 Apr 2008). It is from these
areas that WPV1 originating from Nigeria spread across west, central,
and the Horn of Africa in 2003-2004, re-infecting -- among others --
Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Guinea, and Togo. In addition to international
spread of WPV1 from northern Nigeria, wild poliovirus type 3 (WPV3)
originating from northern Nigeria has been reported from Chad (onset
of most recent case 13 Apr 2008).

The risk of renewed international spread of polio from Nigeria is
increasing due to the intensity of the outbreak in northern Nigeria,
the upcoming rainy season, which is associated with increased
transmission of poliovirus, and the anticipated large-scale
population movements for the Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia)
in the 2nd half of 2008. Saudi Arabia has been notified of the
increased risk of polio infection to Hajj pilgrims.

Nigeria has planned 2 large-scale rounds of emergency polio
immunization in the northern states in July and August 2008.
Large-scale emergency polio immunization campaigns were conducted on
13-16 June [2008] in high-risk and border areas of Benin, Burkina
Faso, Mali, and Niger [see prior ProMED-mail posting Poliomyelitis
(02): Africa, Asia 20080614.1882] , followed by additional campaigns
in July. Disease surveillance is being heightened in 'at-risk'
countries, including in those re-infected in 2003-2006.
