Approximately 45 persons a day are presenting to the consultations at the
Hospital Tony Facio in Limon (Costa Rica) with symptoms of dengue fever.
The negative side is that half of those are presenting with clear symptoms
of classic dengue fever, and in some cases there are manifestations of
hemorrhagic symptoms, informed the doctor in charge of the dengue therapy
unit, Guillermo Kivers.
The clinic is open from 7 AM to 10 PM and for those who are not
hospitalized, there is medical care directed at preventing complications
[preventible complications include dehydration, electrolyte imbalance and
anorexia in classical dengue fever -- in addition, Reye's syndrome has been
reported - MPP]. On Wednesday and Thursday [of this week] there were no
new cases hospitalized. At present there are seven patients hospitalized.
Five have hemorrhagic manifestations and two have classical dengue [fever].
Another 12 patients were discharged in the past few days. There is also
[a child] less than two years old [admitted] in Pediatrics.
According to the data reported, in July there have been 112 cases of dengue
fever, most occurring in the center of Limon. Of these [112 cases of
dengue] at least 47 were reported as having hemorrhagic manifestations as
of this past Tuesday.
Given this situation, the Minister of Health, Rogelio Brown, declared and
indefinite red alert in the province on Wednesday while they are
controlling the epidemic.
The President, Miguel Angel Rodriguez, indicated yesterday, during the
inauguration of a new housing project in Siquirres, the need for the
neighbors [community members] to help resolve the problem through the
emptying of containers of stagnant water in which the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes breed.
