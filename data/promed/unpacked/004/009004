--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the editor:

In December 2020, the University of California San Diego Health (UCSDH) workforce experienced a dramatic increase in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Vaccination with mRNA vaccines began in mid-December 2020; by March [2021], 76% of the workforce had been fully vaccinated, and by July, the percentage had risen to 87%. Infections had decreased dramatically by early February 2021 (1 [see source URL above for complete references, figure, table, and appendix]). Between March and June, fewer than 30 healthcare workers tested positive each month. However, coincident with the end of California's mask mandate on 15 Jun 2021 and the rapid dominance of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant that first emerged in mid-April and accounted for over 95% of UCSDH isolates by the end of July (Figure 1), infections increased rapidly, including cases among fully vaccinated persons. Institutional review board approval was obtained for use of administrative data on vaccinations and case-investigation data to examine mRNA SARS CoV-2 vaccine effectiveness.

UCSDH has a low threshold for SARS-CoV-2 testing, which is triggered by the presence of at least one symptom during daily screening or by an identified exposure, regardless of vaccination status. From 1 Mar through 31 Jul 2021, a total of 227 UCSDH healthcare workers tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse-transcriptase-quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-qPCR) assay of nasal swabs; 130 of the 227 workers (57.3%) were fully vaccinated. Symptoms were present in 109 of the 130 fully vaccinated workers (83.8%) and in 80 of the 90 unvaccinated workers (88.9%). (The remaining 7 workers were only partially vaccinated.) No deaths were reported in either group; one unvaccinated person was hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms.

Vaccine effectiveness was calculated for each month from March through July [2021]; the case definition was a positive PCR test and one or more symptoms among persons with no previous COVID-19 infection (see the Supplementary Appendix). Vaccine effectiveness exceeded 90% from March through June but fell to 65.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.9 to 76.9) in July (Table 1). July case rates were analyzed according to the month in which workers with COVID-19 completed the vaccination series; in workers completing vaccination in January or February, the attack rate was 6.7 per 1000 persons (95% CI, 5.9 to 7.8), whereas the attack rate was 3.7 per 1000 persons (95% CI, 2.5 to 5.7) among those who completed vaccination during the period from March through May. Among unvaccinated persons, the July attack rate was 16.4 per 1000 persons (95% CI, 11.8 to 22.9).

The SARS CoV-2 mRNA vaccines, BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna), have previously shown efficacy rates of 95% and 94.1% (2), respectively, in their initial clinical trials, and for the BNT162b2 vaccine, sustained, albeit slightly decreased, effectiveness (84%) 4 months after the 2nd dose (3). In England, where an extended dosing interval of up to 12 weeks was used, Lopez Bernal et al. reported a preserved vaccine effectiveness of 88% against symptomatic disease associated with the delta variant (4). As observed by others in populations that received mRNA vaccines according to standard Emergency Use Authorization intervals (5), our data suggest that vaccine effectiveness against any symptomatic disease is considerably lower against the delta variant and may wane over time since vaccination.

The dramatic change in vaccine effectiveness from June to July [2021] is likely to be due to both the emergence of the delta variant and waning immunity over time, compounded by the end of masking requirements in California and the resulting greater risk of exposure in the community.

Our findings underline the importance of rapidly reinstating nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as indoor masking and intensive testing strategies, in addition to continued efforts to increase vaccinations, as strategies to prevent avoidable illness and deaths and to avoid mass disruptions to society during the spread of this formidable variant. Furthermore, if our findings on waning immunity are verified in other settings, booster doses may be indicated.

[2] CIDRAP news scan
[A] ECMO patients: mortality rate
Date: Thu 30 Sep 2021

Critically ill COVID-19 patients who received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at the end of 2020 had a higher mortality rate than those who received it in the 1st half of the year, according to a study published yesterday [29 Sep 2021] in The Lancet (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01960-7/fulltext).

Researchers looked at 4812 COVID-19 patients 16 years and older who received ECMO in 2020 across 349 sites and 41 countries. Using 1 May 2020 as an arbitrary marker of the release of COVID-specific guidelines for ECMO, the patients were divided into 3 groups: those who received ECMO through 1 May, those who received ECMO after that point, and those who received it after 1 May who were also at hospitals that didn't offer COVID-19-related ECMO until after 1 May ("late adopters").

Patients who started ECMO on or before 1 May 2020 had a 90-day in-hospital mortality rate of 36.9%, while 51.9% of those who started ECMO after died. Furthermore, those treated at late-adopter centers had a mortality rate of 58.9%. Centers with more ECMO experience (at least 9 patients through 1 May) appeared to have better outcomes than those with less experience (risk-adjusted mortality rate, 0.56).

"The selection of the right patient at the right time is guided by clinical principles and experience, as well as availability, which might perversely delay commencement of ECMO," writes Alain Vuylsteke, MD, in a related commentary (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02137-1/fulltext). "In the report by Barbaro and colleagues, no one knows if some patients survived despite ECMO they did not need, or if some died just because of ECMO, or what happened to those who were denied ECMO -- this is still the conundrum to clarify before we decide if ECMO is worth using or not."

"ECMO cannot be blamed for the increased mortality; it is merely a tool and clinicians still need to understand when to use it for the greatest benefit," Vuylsteke concludes.

[B] Scotland: vaccination
Date: Thu 30 Sep 2021

Less than 0.05% of Scottish people at least partially vaccinated against COVID-19 were hospitalized or died from the virus, according to a large, population-based study looking at data from 8 Dec 2020 to 18 Apr 2021.

The results, published yesterday [29 Sep 2021] in The Lancet (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00380-5/fulltext), showed that of 2 572 008 Scottish people, 883 needed COVID-19-related hospitalization, and 541 died from COVID-19 infection after the 1st dose of either the Pfizer/BioNTech (32.7%) or the AstraZeneca/Oxford (67.3%) vaccine. Median follow-up after the 1st vaccination was 55 days, and of the 27.0% of people who received a 2nd dose within the study period, median follow-up after the 2nd dose was 19 days.

Higher risk was associated with being 80 years or older vs being 18-64 (adjusted risk ratio [aRR], 4.75), having 5 or more comorbidities (aRR, 4.24), being hospitalized in the previous 4 weeks (aRR, 3.00), or being employed in a high-risk occupation (aRR, 2.14). Those who were residents in a care home (aRR, 1.63), socioeconomically deprived (most deprived quintile vs least, aRR, 1.57), male (aRR, 1.27), or an ex-smoker vs a non-smoker (aRR, 1.18) also had higher risks.

On the other hand, the researchers note, having COVID-19 prior to vaccination was protective (aRR, 0.40). Those who had a longer interval between the 2 doses also appeared to have a lower risk (the United Kingdom extended the vaccine dose intervals to 8-12 weeks to maximize supply).

"Restricting booster doses to populations at the highest risk for severe disease will allow maximisation of booster dose benefits, with a minimised effect on global vaccine distribution," write Eyal Lehsem, MD, and others in a related commentary (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(21)00413-6/fulltext).

"The findings reported by Agrawal and colleagues allow identification and prioritisation of at-risk populations to be considered for boosting. Additionally, characterising the risks, or lack thereof, of delayed dosing schedules can aid policy makers in considering viable alternatives to standard dosing schedules in settings where vaccine availability is limited."

[3] Rural USA fatality rates and Los Angeles vaccine certificates
Date: Thu 30 Sep 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/09/rural-americans-more-likely-die-covid-19


Rural Americans are currently twice as likely to die from COVID-19 infections compared with their urban peers, according to Kaiser Health News (https://khn.org/news/article/covid-death-rate-rural-america/) and data from the Rural Policy Research Institute (RPRI) at the University of Iowa (https://rupri.public-health.uiowa.edu/publications/policybriefs/2020/COVID%20Longitudinal%20Data.pdf).

Since March 2020, 1 in 434 rural Americans have died from COVID-19, compared with roughly 1 in 513 urban Americans. And unlike deaths in urban areas, the vaccine rollout has not slowed COVID-19 fatalities in rural parts of the country due to low uptake. Short-staffed hospitals and limited access to healthcare are also contributing factors, the researchers say.

Current 7-day average fatality rates are twice as high in rural regions, at more than 0.8 deaths per 100 000 population, compared with 0.4 per 100 000 in urban areas, according to RPRI data. Virus incidence rates in September [2021] were roughly 54% higher in rural areas than elsewhere, and in 39 states, rural counties had higher rates of COVID than urban counties.

In related news, health officials in Idaho, a predominately rural state with some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country, said more kids and babies are being hospitalized with COVID-related complications. As of this week, 1700 new COVID-19 cases were reported in children in Idaho, according to the Associated Press (https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-lifestyle-business-pandemics-idaho-b08d1940be1a3278645d6df155b278d1).

Overall, the United States reported 123 269 new COVID-19 cases and 2531 deaths yesterday [29 Sep 2021], according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 113 573, with 1986 daily deaths, according to the Washington Post tracker (https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=hp_pandemic). In total, the country has seen 43 401 309 COVID-19 cases since the pandemic began, including 695 957 deaths.

Los Angeles considers vaccine passports
---------------------------------------
The Los Angeles city council has proposed an ordinance that would require people to show proof of vaccination to enter many indoor public spaces, such as restaurants, gyms, and movie theaters, the Los Angeles Times reports (https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-09-29/la-council-puts-off-vote-proof-of-vaccination-indoor-venues).

Written exemptions for religious or medical reasons may be used, but businesses are required to serve those customers outside if possible. If that is not possible, exempt customers must provide proof that they recently tested negative.

While the council vote was delayed yesterday [29 Sep 2021], if the majority passes it next week, the ordinance will take effect 4 Nov 2021.

Los Angeles County currently has an indoor mask mandate. In August 2021, New York City began to require proof of at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine for workers and customers at indoor sites for dining, physical fitness, and entertainment venues.

Global headlines
----------------
- The risk of a COVID surge in Europe over the next 2 months is very high, due to high virus circulation from the delta (B1617.2) variant and breakthrough cases in vulnerable people, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said in its latest risk assessment. It also predicted greater proportions of cases in children. So far, only 61% of the European region's population are fully vaccinated, and levels vary widely by country. Health officials urged countries to step up their vaccination efforts and take other COVID-19 measures, depending on the local epidemiologic situation (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/news-events/high-risk-autumn-surge-covid-19-cases-and-deaths-countries-insufficient-vaccination).

- In Australia today [30 Sep 2021], Victoria state reported 1438 new cases -- a 50% jump -- partly fueled by people breaking distancing rules to gather to watch the country's football final, according to Reuters. Half the state's population 16 or over have received a vaccine dose, a level below the country average of 53% (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-victoria-reports-record-new-covid-19-cases-2021-09-29/).

- Viet Nam's main COVID-19 hot spot Ho Chi Minh City began loosening restrictions today [30 Sep 2021] after 4 months of mitigation measures. Illness levels have declined, and the country hopes to restart the economy and learn to balance case prevention and regular activities (https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnams-biggest-city-start-lifting-covid-19-curbs-revive-business-2021-09-30/).

- The global total today [30 Sep 2021] reached 233 572 830 cases, and 4 778 857 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).
