Key Points
----------
Question: What is the most efficient way to diagnose Powassan encephalitis in an immunocompromised patient?

Findings: In this case report of a patient with fatal Powassan encephalitis with negative serology, diagnosis was made by Powassan virus immunohistochemistry, targeted real-time polymerase chain reaction, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing.

Meaning: In immunosuppressed patients, many tools can be used to make a diagnosis when routine testing results are negative, including unbiased sequencing assays.

Abstract
--------
Importance: Powassan virus is a rare but increasingly recognized cause of severe neurological disease.

Objective: To highlight the diagnostic challenges and neuropathological findings in a fatal case of Powassan encephalitis caused by [blacklegged] tick virus (lineage II) in a patient with follicular lymphoma receiving rituximab, with nonspecific anti-GAD65 antibodies, who was initially seen with fever and orchiepididymitis.

Design, Setting, and Participants: Comparison of clinical, radiological, histological, and laboratory findings, including immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, antibody detection, and unbiased sequencing assays, in a single case report (1st seen in December 2016) at an academic medical center.

Exposure: Infection with Powassan virus.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Results of individual assays compared retrospectively.

Results: In a 63-year-old man with fatal Powassan encephalitis, serum and cerebrospinal fluid IgM antibodies were not detected via standard methods, likely because of rituximab exposure. Neuropathological findings were extensive, including diffuse leptomeningeal and parenchymal lymphohistiocytic infiltration, microglial proliferation, marked neuronal loss, and white matter microinfarctions most severely involving the cerebellum, thalamus, and basal ganglia. Diagnosis was made after death by 3 independent methods, including demonstration of Powassan virus antigen in brain biopsy and autopsy tissue, detection of viral RNA in serum and cerebrospinal fluid by targeted real-time polymerase chain reaction, and detection of viral RNA in cerebrospinal fluid by unbiased sequencing. Extensive testing for other etiologies yielded negative results, including mumps virus owing to prodromal orchiepididymitis. Low-titer anti-GAD65 antibodies identified in serum, suggestive of limbic encephalitis, were not detected in cerebrospinal fluid.

Conclusions and Relevance: Owing to the rarity of Powassan encephalitis, a high degree of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis, particularly in an immunocompromised patient, in whom antibody-based assays may be falsely negative. Unbiased sequencing assays have the potential to detect uncommon infectious agents and may prove useful in similar scenarios.

[Although the key points and abstract above do not indicate where the patient acquired his Powassan virus infection, several author's affiliations were hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, so presumably the man was infected in the northeastern USA, where Powassan virus is endemic and cases occur there sporadically. The tick vector is the blacklegged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_. A previous ProMED-mail post (Powassan virus encephalitis - USA (05) 20170713.5173071) stated that Powassan virus (POWV, Flaviviridae) is the only North American member of the tick-borne encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses. It is transmitted to small- and medium-sized mammals by _Ixodes scapularis_, _Ixodes cookei_, and several other _Ixodes_ tick species.

Humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from the natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV is the causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness with 50 percent of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae. POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958 when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, Canada. In this case POWV was isolated from the brain autopsy. There are 2 distinct genetic lineages of POWV now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and blacklegged tick virus (lineage II). Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 16 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. In the past 5 years, both basic and applied research for POWV disease has intensified, including phylogenetic studies, field surveillance, case studies, and animal model development.

The above report illustrates the need to employ a variety of diagnostic tests in unusual circumstances when standard tests are negative. - Mod.TY
