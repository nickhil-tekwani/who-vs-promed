[The 3 new confirmed and 2582 suspected cases (down 3 from 6 confirmed and up from 2504 suspected cases in the report of week 19 [6-12 May 2019]) indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing. Nigeria is still within the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Fig. 3. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (1 Jan-17 Mar 2019) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2019). There still are 129 confirmed deaths, with no increase from the previous reporting period. Fortunately, there are no new healthcare workers infected during this reporting period, and the total number of infected healthcare workers remains at 18. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 21 states and the number of affected LGAs remaining at 82.

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

The maps and graphs in the report above are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. - Mod.TY
