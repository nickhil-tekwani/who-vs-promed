A mystery illness, which forced vets to put down 8 horses in 3 weeks,
has been identified as the highly contagious and potentially fatal
bacterial infection, glanders, which can be passed on to humans.

The Cabinet yesterday [25 Apr 2010] allocated BD 150 000 [USD 397
835] to combat the disease. It also instructed the Municipalities and
Agriculture Ministry to carry out the preventive plan.

"The decision reflects the government's keenness to protect human
health, the environment and animals," Cabinet Affairs minister Shaikh
Ahmed bin Ateyatala Al Khalifa said.

However, Bahrain's top vet yesterday [25 Apr 2010] allayed fears of a
serious outbreak, saying authorities were already acting on the new
information and said it could be "easily" managed.

Municipalities and Agriculture Ministry livestock director Dr Salman
Abdul Nabi said every horse in the country was being examined for
signs of the illness.

He added that blood samples from of horses, suspected of either
having the illness or coming into contact with infected animals, were
currently being analysed by specialists in the UAE. "We have sent
samples from nearly 400 horses to a specialist laboratory in the UAE
[United Arab Emirates] and the 10 results we have got so far give us
the all-clear," he told the GDN. "We now know we can manage this
quite easily and are taking appropriate action."

However, he stressed that a ban on moving horses between stables or
taking part in competitions still existed to avoid the bacteria spreading.

He revealed around a dozen horses currently had symptoms of the
infection, but said some were already showing signs of recovery.

Glanders is a highly contagious disease in horses, mules, and
donkeys, but it can be passed on to humans who have direct contact
with infected animals or contaminated objects. The painful
respiratory infection can cause skin lesions and signs include fever,
chills, muscle aches, and chest pain, but without treatment it can
also lead to pneumonia and death.

[Glanders (also known as farcy, malleus, droes) is a serious zoonotic
bacterial disease that primarily affects horses, mules, and donkeys.
Some animals die acutely within a few weeks. Others become
chronically infected, and can spread the disease for years before
succumbing. Although human disease is uncommon, it is life
threatening and painful. Without antibiotic treatment, the case
fatality rate can be as high as 95 percent. Occasionally, glanders
also occurs in other mammalian species, particularly members of the cat family.

Glanders was a worldwide problem in equids for several centuries, but
it was eradicated from most countries by the mid-1900s. Outbreaks are
now uncommon and reported from limited geographic areas; since 2007,
2 countries have submitted to the OIE detailed reports on glanders
being endemic, namely Iran and Brazil. In non-endemic regions, cases
may be seen in people who work with the causative organism,
_Burkholderia mallei_, in secure laboratories. An infection was
reported in a US researcher in 2000. Glanders is also considered to
be a serious bioterrorist threat.

_B. mallei_ has been weaponized and was used as a biological weapon
against military horses, or animals and humans, during the 1st and
2nd world wars. If this organism is aerosolized during a biological
attack or in a laboratory accident, the morbidity rate could be high.

The information above is based upon "Disease information" provided by
the Center for Food Security and Public Health (CFSPH) at the Iowa
State University College of Veterinary Medicine; for the full chapter
on Glanders, updated 31 Aug 2007, see
<http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/glanders.pdf>.

OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals
2009 covers glanders in chapter 2.5.11
(<http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.05.11_GLANDERS.pdf>).
The chapter includes the following summary (abridged):

"Glanders is caused by infection with the bacterium _Burkholderia
mallei_ (the name recently changed from _Pseudomonas mallei_ and was
previously classified as _Pfeifferella_, _Loefflerella_,
_Malleomyces_, or _Actinobacillus_). The disease causes nodules and
ulcerations in the upper respiratory tract and lungs. A skin form
also occurs, known as 'farcy'. Control of glanders requires testing
of suspect clinical cases, screening of apparently normal equids, and
elimination of positive reactors. It is transmitted to humans and all
infected/contaminated or potentially infected/contaminated material
must be handled in a laboratory that meets the requirements for
Containment Group 3 pathogens.

Identification of the agent
---------------------------
Smears from fresh material may reveal gram-negative nonsporulating,
nonencapsulated rods. The presence of a capsule-like cover has been
demonstrated by electron microscopy. The bacteria grow aerobically
and prefer media that contain glycerol. Unlike the _Pseudomonas_
species and the closely related bacterium _Burkholderia
pseudomallei_, _Burkholderia mallei_ is nonmotile. Guinea-pigs are
highly susceptible, and males can be used, if strictly necessary, to
recover the organism from a heavily contaminated sample. Commercially
available biochemical identification kits lack diagnostic
sensitivity. Specific monoclonal antibodies and polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) as well as real-time PCR assays are available. The
latter have also been evaluated in recent outbreaks.

Mallein and serological tests
-----------------------------
The mallein test is a sensitive and specific clinical test for
hypersensitivity against _Burkholderia mallei_. Mallein, a water
soluble protein fraction of the organism, is injected subcutaneously,
intradermo-palpebrally or given by eyedrop. In infected animals, the
skin or the eyelid swells markedly within 1-2 days. Complement
fixation test and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are the most
accurate and reliable serological tests for diagnostic use. A rose
bengal plate agglutination test has recently been developed in
Russia; it has been validated in Russia only.

Requirements for vaccines and diagnostic biologicals
----------------------------------------------------
There are no vaccines. Mallein purified protein derivative is
currently available commercially from the Central Veterinary Control
and Research Institute, 06020 Etlik, Ankara, Turkey".

According to Bahrain's information to the OIE, glanders, which is a
reportable disease there, has never been reported in Bahrain before.
No report on the current outbreak is yet available on the OIE WAHID
epidemiological database system. - Mod.AS]
