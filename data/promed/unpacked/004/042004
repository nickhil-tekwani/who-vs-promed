Section 144 CrPC [Criminal Procedure Code] has been clamped on dogs
in Lunglei town, the headquarters of Lunglei district in south
Mizoram, for 2 months. [Section 144 confers powers to issue an order
absolute at once in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger. -
Mod.CP]

The prohibitory step was taken last week [week of 28 Mar 2011] after
dogs bit at least 10 persons, Lunglei district deputy commissioner
Margaret Zomingthangi said over the telephone today [Wed 6 Apr 2011].

The administration has asked the residents of the headquarters town
to keep their dogs, raised as pets or reared for meat, inside their
home compounds and not to allow them into the streets under any
circumstances.

The inhabitants of Mizoram relish canine meat and rear dogs for that
purpose. These dogs are often left to roam the streets, as they find
their way back on their own. Some of these dogs had bitten the 10
people.

Zomingthangi said all the persons bitten by dogs had been admitted to
Lunglei civil hospital. She said in case of 4 very poor patients, the
administration had asked the hospital authorities to supply free
medicines and proper nursing to them [post-exposure vaccination?].
She, however, denied reports that a shoot-at-sight order had been
issued to prevent rogue canines from biting pedestrians.

Zomingthangi said no head count of the canine population had ever
been done in her district, but a rough estimate put the number of dogs
in the town at 4800.

[Merritt Clifton has offered the following comment:
"The report above published in Kolkata (formerly Calcutta), pertains
to a rabies outbreak far to the northeast, in Assam, located in the
tongue of India which lies between China to the north, Myanmar to the
east, and Bangladesh to the south.

It is the 1st news report I have seen which links raising dogs for
meat in northeast India to rabies, although I have heard rumors to
this effect from animal advocates in Assam and Mizoram state, just
south of Assam, for about a dozen years. (Northeast India is the only
part of India where dog-eating is reputedly common. Many Assamese
swear that only Mizorans eat dogs, but regardless of who does it,
historically the practice does seem to occur in both states.)

The article describes a method of dog-rearing for sale which is
similar to the common practice of goat, dairy cattle, and pig farmers
all over India, of simply turning animals loose to fend for themselves
each day, then rounding them up in the evening so as to maintain the
degree of "ownership" necessary to establish title to sell the
animals, or their products and byproducts.

This is quite different from the dog-rearing practice in southern
China, also associated with rabies outbreaks, in which dogs are
essentially factory-farmed by the multi-hundreds, perhaps thousands.
In either place, though, dogs meant for human consumption are not
vaccinated.

The mode of raising dogs for human consumption in the smaller nations
of Southeast Asia and in Korea usually follows yet another pattern. In
those regions, typically small numbers are kept in pens, more-or-less
in the traditional pre-factory farm manner of pig-raising --
essentially as an adjunct to other types of farming, or fishing, not
as the farmer's whole business. These dogs are not vaccinated
either."
