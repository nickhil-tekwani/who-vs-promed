Vets have warned pet owners after a dog died of a mystery illness known as Alabama rot.

Willows group, which runs The Laurels surgery on Victoria Road, said the owner had only walked the canine in the Town Park [in Runcorn, Cheshire, England]. It became ill and passed away in mid-December [2014]. A post-mortem confirmed the diagnosis with the presence of the disease in the kidneys and skin.

Alabama rot's cause remains unknown but stricken dogs will develop skin lesions and over 1--9 days may show symptoms of renal failure such as vomiting, tiredness and reduced appetite.

Another veterinary group, Anderson Moores, is collecting data about cases and said very few cases of the disease occur and that most skin lesions and cases of kidney failure will have another cause. It said early recognition and 'aggressive management' of the condition is likely to lead to the best outcome.

The disease was 1st recorded in the USA in the 1980s and at 1st was believed to only affect greyhounds. However, it is not confined to breed, sex or age.

In its advice for owners, Anderson Moore said: "The skin lesions are a symptom of the disease rather than being traumatic wounds from an injury. "Typically the skin lesions have been below the knee or elbow but lesions have also been seen on the face and the skin of the bottom of the chest and abdomen. The lesions may present as a patch of red skin or a defect in the skin, like an ulcer, and have typically ranged from 0.5 cm to 5 cm in diameter."

[Runcorn and Widnes are situated in Cheshire; earlier cases in dogs with similar or resembling clinical and/or pathological observations have come from the New Forest district in Hampshire, south England, coined "New Forest syndrome" (See in "see also").

"Alabama rot," mentioned above as resembling the recent cases in Cheshire (and the earlier New Forest syndrome in dogs), was coined in the US as "idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy of greyhounds," a "potentially fatal disease of unknown etiology that affects the skin and kidneys of racing- and training-age Greyhounds" (Ref. 2). The 3 main, typical findings were:
1. characteristic, well-demarcated cutaneous ulcers of the extremities,
2. thrombocytopenia (higher than 200 000 plateletddl), and
3. acute renal insufficiency (BUN higher than 40 mg/dl, serum creatinine higher than 2.0 mg/dl).

It was later suggested (Ref. 3) that the syndrome could have been attributed to Shiga toxin ("racing greyhounds are fed raw meat from rendering plants which commonly contains pathogenic _E. coli_").

It is yet to be investigated whether there is any relevance between the recorded US observations in greyhounds, the syndrome reported from New Forest, and the current cases in Cheshire.

Another syndrome in UK canines, "seasonal canine illness (SCI)," has been reportedly occurring in recent years between August and November, mainly in woodlands in Norfolk, Nottinghamshire, and Suffolk. SCI affected dogs of any size, shape, or sex, causing them to become very ill, very quickly after being walked in woodlands. The most common clinical signs were sickness, diarrhoea, and lethargy. Investigation of SCI has been undertaken by the Animal Health Trust (AHT) since September 2010. Their recent poster for dog owners (updated 2014) is available at http://www.aht.org.uk/skins/Default/pdfs/sci_2014poster.pdf.

Any new information on the newly recognised syndrome resembling "idiopathic cutaneous and renal glomerular vasculopathy" in the UK, will be appreciated.
