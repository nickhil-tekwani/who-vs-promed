The Florida Department of Health says that 2 horses have tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), one in central and one in east Pasco County. Officials said the mosquito-borne illness could be transmitted to humans.

EEE virus is spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes and is not transmitted from human to human. It's one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain, the department of health said.

Infections in people can cause headache, fever, dizziness, confusion, movement disorders and coma. Those at highest risk include people who live in or visit wooded areas, work outdoors, or participate in outdoor recreation that puts them at a greater risk of exposure to potentially infected mosquitoes, officials said.

Health officials encourage residents to take precautions to limit exposure to mosquitoes, including staying indoors at dusk and dawn, dressing in clothing that covers the skin, using repellents, and eliminating standing water where mosquitoes lay eggs.

Horse owners should contact their veterinarian for information on vaccination of horses against mosquito-borne diseases, officials said.

Officials in Marion County have confirmed that a 3rd horse has tested positive for eastern equine encephalitis (EEE).

According to the CDC, EEE can be transmitted to humans through a mosquito bite and can be fatal.

According to the Florida Department of Health, the horse was located about a mile west of Ocala Springs Elementary School. It's the 3rd case in Marion County in less than 3 months. Horses also tested positive on 22 Apr and 31 May 2014.

Health officials want to remind residents to protect themselves from mosquitoes to avoid getting infected.

[Neither of these articles mentions the most effective way to protect your horse. Vaccination is very effective and can save the life of animal. Furthermore, there are equine-specific mosquito sprays and repellants. Use them.

Get rid of standing water (in old tires, flowerpot drain basins and numerous other tiny hiding places that hold water and can be a breeding ground for mosquitoes).

Protect yourself with long sleeves, and don't be outside around dusk or dawn, and be sure to use a mosquito repellant with Deet.
