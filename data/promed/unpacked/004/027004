Brucellosis Outbreak Reported
------------------------------
Brucellosis, an infectious disease which can cause miscarriages in
cows and chronic flu-like symptoms in humans, has reemerged in South
Korea, sending shudders through the domestic cattle industry,
according to quarantine officials, Sat 31 Jan 2004.
15 dairy cows on a farm in Chongup, North Cholla Province, have
tested positive, while 4 others tested "quasi-positive,"
[suspected?!] they said.
To prevent the spread of the disease, quarantine authorities have
decided to slaughter all of the infected cows and sterilize
[decontaminate] nearby areas.
Brucellosis can cause spontaneous miscarriages by pregnant cows and
chronic fever if transmitted to humans, who can contract the sickness
by consuming contaminated dairy products or coming into direct
contact with infected cattle.
The county reported its first outbreak of the disease in February
2003. About 900 cattle at 10 farms were slaughtered at that time.

[Brucellosis is endemic in Korea; 110 outbreaks have been reported
during 2002, the last year for which Brucellosis data are available
on the OIE web-site. (List B diseases are required to be reported
once a year, except when the disease is introduced for the first
time, or demonstrates an exceptional epidemiology/characteristics).
Is this a newly introduced infection in the North Cholla province?
