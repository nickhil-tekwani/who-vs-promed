Hemodialysis remains a very effective treatment for methanol poisoning.
Victims of methanol poisoning can be effectively treated with ethanol but
this can take some time, and caring for an intoxicated patient for days can
be an extraordinary challenge for nursing staff. In the hands of an
experienced dialysis team, hemodialysis is a very safe and effective
treatment for methanol poisoning.

[The discussion regarding treatment of methanol intoxication has been
interesting, but unless there is a further outbreak, this thread is closed.
