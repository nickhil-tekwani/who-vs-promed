Hangzhou suspended live poultry trade, making it the 2nd city in China to take this action since an unusual strain of bird flu has hit the country, state-run media outlet Xinhua reported Saturday [6 Apr 2013].

Shanghai is the other city to close live poultry trading after the outbreak that has left 6 dead. Chinese authorities have killed more than 20 000 birds from a live-poultry trading zone in Shanghai in an effort to deal with the issue. The cull at the Shanghai poultry trading zone came as researchers in the United States said they had started work on developing a vaccine for H7N9.

Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, announced yesterday [6 Apr 2013] that it was suspending live poultry trading -- the 2nd [or 3rd?] city to do so, following Shanghai.

And in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, officials closed a farm produce market after H7N9 was detected among birds for sale.

The National Health and Family Planning Commission said yesterday [6 Apr 2013] that the country's H7N9 cases were isolated and there has been no sign of human-to-human transmission.

Also yesterday [6 Apr 2013], Shanghai authorities began enforcing a ban on live poultry from other parts of the country from entering the city after temporarily closing 3 markets to battle the H7N9 bird flu. The authorities have launched inspections on roads, said the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Commission.

Meanwhile, Nanjing yesterday [6 Apr 2013] ordered the suspension of all live poultry trade and the immediate shuttering of poultry markets. The Nanjing government announced at a press conference that it has assembled a team to lead H7N9 bird flu virus prevention and control.

"Sales of live poultry at the 3 main poultry trade markets -- Zijinshan, Tianyinshan, and Jianye -- which account for 90 percent of all poultry in the city, have been banned," said Wang Zhixi, deputy director of the Industrial and Commercial Bureau of Nanjing. "Meanwhile, we will ban live poultry from other places from entering the city, as well as stop transporting birds out of Nanjing," Wang added.

The 2nd person confirmed to have H7N9 in Zhejiang Province was found to have eaten quail bought from the Binsheng Agricultural and Sideline Products Market in Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City. Local government staff slaughtered poultry at the market yesterday.
