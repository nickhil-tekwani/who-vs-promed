Pig disease found in Ohio dog that died
----------------------------------
The Ohio Department of Agriculture is working with animal health experts to determine the cause and origin of a series of dog illnesses in the state.

The department's Division of Animal Health has been taking reports of severe dog illnesses in several parts of the state for the past 3 weeks.

Affected dogs have exhibited similar signs including vomiting, bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and lethargy. [These are the same clinical signs that pigs with circovirus have. - Mod.TG]

Although there are several known causes of these signs in dogs, it is generally believed that there is an unknown contributor to the cases. "While we continue to work diligently to identify what is making these dogs sick, we are asking Ohio's veterinarians to help by contacting our laboratory for consultation if they suspect they are treating a related case," said State Veterinarian Dr Tony Forshey.

As part of its investigation, the department also announced the presence of canine circovirus in a fecal sample taken from an ill dog in the state.

This is the 1st laboratory detection of canine circovirus in Ohio. Further work is being done to verify the significance of this finding. [But there are cases in California, and Cincinnati, that may well be the same as what is currently happening in Canal Fulton, Ohio (see ProMED-mail posting 20130907.1928773 and http://www.ohio.com/news/break-news/virus-linked-to-illness-that-has-sickened-several-ohio-dogs-1.426633). - Mod.TG]

Canine circovirus is newly isolated and there is very little information available about the virus, where it came from and how it spreads. The limited research available shows that canine circovirus can cause vasculitis and hemorrhaging in infected dogs.

The CDC published a report on the disease isolation back in April [2013] at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/4/12-1390_article.htm.

The Ohio Department of Agriculture will continue to investigate the situation and urge veterinarians who believe they are treating dogs with similar symptoms to consult the laboratory by calling (614) 728-6220.

The department has also recommended concerned dog owners take standard precautions used to reduce the spread of viral infections, including monitoring the animal closely for signs of illness and refraining from co mingling them with other dogs.

[The report published in the CDC journal Emerging Infectious Diseases mentioned above is a detailed research article that is very helpful in understanding some of the situation with dogs and this virus. Readers are encouraged to access that website and read the report.
