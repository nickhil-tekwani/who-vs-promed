Sleeping sickness spreading into southern Angola
--------------------------------------------------
Sleeping sickness is ravaging Angola, threatening a sizeable section of the
population across 14 of the 18 provinces. This is happening while Angola is
still struggling to rebuild after a 27-year civil war that ended in April 2002.
"The situation in Angola is alarming," said Ndinga Dieyi Dituvanga, a
doctor and an official with the Institute for the Prevention of
Trypanosomiasis, the scientific name for the disease, which affects both
human beings and cattle. In 2003, 96 Angolans died of sleeping sickness
while 3115 new cases and 270 000 suspected cases were detected nationwide,
Dituvanga said.
The 4 southern provinces of Kunene, Huambo, Namibe, and Huila are the only
ones not affected so far. However, it is virtually endemic in the 7
northern provinces of Bengo, Kwanza north and Kwanza south, Luanda,
Malange, Uige, and Zaire. The ICCT (the French acronym for the
trypanosomiasis institute) admitted that there were vast areas where it had
been completely unable to intervene. Despite a crippling lack of funds, the
ICCT said that in 2003 it had managed to destroy 1 million tsetse flies in
the 7 worst-hit provinces, including the province of Luanda, where the
Angolan capital is located.
Dituvanga said sleeping sickness was for Angola a social, economic, and
political problem, as it had hit provinces rich in mineral resources, such
as oil-bearing Zaire province and diamond-bearing Malange.
The ICCT has 21 diagnostic and treatment centres for sleeping sickness.
They are run by 9 doctors, 5 researchers, an entomologist, 148 nurses, and
53 laboratory staff. The institute runs periodic campaigns to try to detect
new cases and follow up with treatment, working in partnership with 8
international non-governmental organisations. The biggest treatment and
research facility is located in Viana, close to Luanda, and has 84 beds
that are constantly occupied.
Sleeping sickness was first detected in Angola in 1871, but it was only in
1901 that the first medical team arrived there to combat the disease, which
was then put under control until the country's independence from Portugal
in 1975. But since then it has spread alarmingly.
A report published by the African Union in February in 2003 said sleeping
sickness threatened development across the continent, with more than 500
000 suffering from the disease, 80 percent of whom perish.
About 20 species of the tsetse fly are found across 1/3 of the continent in
37 sub-Saharan countries. Trypanosomiasis is also one of the most deadly
parasite-borne animal diseases.
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, trypanosomiasis
kills 3 million head of livestock every year, and sick animals become less
productive. Sleeping sickness threatens about 50 million cattle in Africa,
according to a recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organisation.

[The previous reports on human trypanosomiasis have been from the area
around the town of Uige in the northern parts of Angola. This is the first
report of widespread trypanosomiasis in the southern provinces of Kunene,
Huambo, Namibe, and Huila. Thus the epidemic seems to be spreading and
getting closer to Namibia and Botswana. Trypanosomiasis in Angola is a
zoonotic infection with cattle and game (e.g. buffalo) as reservoirs, and
control relies on trapping and spraying for the tsetse fly and restricting
movement of cattle and game. - Mod.EP]
