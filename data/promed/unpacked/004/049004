2000/069 Studies on the geographical distribution of lettuce infectious
yellows crinivirus, cucurbit yellow stunting disorder crinivirus and beet
pseudo-yellows closterovirus (edited by DH)
Lettuce infectious yellows crinivirus (LIYV - EPPO A1 quarantine pest),
cucurbit yellow stunting disorder crinivirus (CYSDV- EPPO Alert List), and
beet pseudo-yellows closterovirus (BPYV) are transmitted in a
semipersistent way by whiteflies. LIYV is transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_
(poorly transmitted by biotype B), CYSDV by _B. tabaci_ (including biotype
B), and BPYV by _Trialeurodes vaporariorum_. These viruses have overlapping
host ranges and can cause similar symptoms, e.g. in cucurbits. LIYV has
been reported from limited regions in USA, CYSDV from some parts of Europe
and the Middle East, and BPYV is more widespread. Four hundred ninety-eight
cucurbit samples (_Citrullus lanatus_, _Cucumis sativus_, _Cucumis melo_,
_Cucurbita pepo_) showing yellowing symptoms or infested by whiteflies were
collected from field or glasshouse crops in California (US), Middle East
(Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey) and Europe (Spain, Crete (GR), Italy).
Samples were specifically tested for the presence of these three viruses
and molecular variation between virus isolates was also studied. LIYV was
not found in any sample (this virus is now reported to be very rare in
California). CYSDV was found in 69 samples from the Middle East and Europe:
49 from Spain, 9 from Jordan, 5 from Saudi Arabia*, 6 from Turkey. BPYV was
found in 12 samples: 9 from Italy and 3 from Crete. The authors noted that
in Europe the geographical distribution of CYSDV and BPYV is not
overlapping. In Spain, the displacement of BPYV by CYSDV has been
correlated with the increase of _B. tabaci_ (and of the B biotype)
populations replacing _T. vaporariorum_. Similarly the disappearance of
LIYV in California has been associated with the displacement of certain
biotypes of _B. tabaci_ by the B biotype which is a very poor vector of
this virus. Studies on the molecular variation among virus isolates showed
rather high homogeneity. CYSDV isolates could be divided into two groups:
one group was only composed of isolates from Spain, Jordan and Turkey and a
second group was predominantly composed of isolates found in Saudi Arabia.
* The EPPO Secretariat had previously no data on the occurrence of CYSDV in
Saudi Arabia.

[LIYV, CYSDV, and BPYV are members of the family Closteroviridae. _Bemisia
tabaci_ (Gennadius) is the common whitefly and the so-called B biotype is
also known as _B. argentifolii_. The disappearance of LIYV from California
appears to be associated with the displacement of _B. tabaci_ by _B.
argentifolii_ which is a very poor vector of the virus. The distinct,
non-overlapping geographical distribution of BPYV and CYSDV in Europe is
an interesting observation that needs further investigation. - Mod.DH
