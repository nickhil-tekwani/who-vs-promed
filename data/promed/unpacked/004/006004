On 28 Oct 2009, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine informed WHO, through its
Country Office in Ukraine, about an unusually high level of activity of
acute respiratory illness in the western part of the country, associated
with an increased number of hospital admissions and fatalities.

On 30 Oct 2009, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine announced the
confirmation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection by RT-PCR in 11 out of
30 samples obtained from patients presenting with acute respiratory illness
in 2 of the most affected regions. Tests were performed in 2 laboratories
in Kyiv, including the National Influenza Centre. Confirmatory tests will
be performed at one of the WHO Collaborating Centres for Influenza.

The situation is quickly changing with increasingly high levels of acute
respiratory illness (ARI)/influenza-like-illness (ILI) activity being
observed in Ternopil, Lviv, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Chernivtsi regions. The
higher levels of transmission in these regions corresponds to an increased
number of hospital admissions and fatalities associated with severe
manifestations of acute respiratory illness.

As of 30 Oct 2009, over 2300 individuals have been admitted to hospital,
including over 1100 children. 131 cases have required intensive care,
including 32 children. As of 31 Oct 2009, a total of 38 fatalities
associated with severe manifestations of ARI have been registered.
Preliminary epidemiological data analysis indicates that severe cases and
deaths primarily occur among previously healthy young adults aged 20-50
years. Fatal and severe cases are reported to have sought medical attention
5 to 7 days after onset of symptoms.

International experience of the (H1N1) 2009 pandemic to date, especially
from the Southern Hemisphere, has shown that poor clinical outcomes are
associated with delays in seeking health care and limited access to
supportive care. In addition, this virus has also shown its ability to
cause rapidly progressive overwhelming lung disease, which is very
difficult to treat.

Public health measures recommended by the Ministry of Health of Ukraine
across the entire country include: social distancing (school closures and
cancellation of mass gatherings); enhancement of surveillance activities;
increased respiratory hygiene; and continuation of the vaccination campaign
against seasonal influenza targeting at-risk groups.

The Government of Ukraine has activated coordination mechanisms to respond
to the rapidly evolving situation, including the harmonization of response
plans across all administrative levels. In response to the request from the
minister of health of Ukraine, WHO is deploying a multidisciplinary team of
experts to assist national authorities in mitigating the impact of the
pandemic. The team comprises the following expertise: health emergencies
coordination, case management, epidemiology, laboratory diagnostics,
logistics, and media/risk communications.

As per WHO's communication in May 2009, there is no rationale for travel
restrictions, because such measures will not prevent the spread of the
disease. Travellers can protect themselves and others by following simple
recommendations aimed at preventing the spread of infection such as
attention to respiratory hygiene. Individuals who are ill should delay
travel plans, and returning travellers who fall ill should seek appropriate
medical care. These recommendations are prudent measures which can limit
the spread of many communicable diseases and not only the pandemic (H1N1)
2009 virus.

[This is confirmation by WHO that the outbreak of acute respiratory illness
throughout Ukraine is an extension of the global influenza (H1N1) 2009
pandemic. So far in Ukraine, 11 of 30 patient samples have tested positive
for influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Confirmatory tests are in
progress in another WHO Collaborating Centre. As of 30 Oct 2009, a total of
2300 people (including 1100 children) have been hospitalised, and as of 31
Oct 2009, there have been 38 fatalities. The Ukrainian authorities seem to
have been unprepared for an outbreak on this scale, and WHO involvement in
the control of the outbreak will be considerable. No travel restrictions
are envisaged.
