An unidentified disease has been found in isolated banana fields
locally, but according to agriculture minister Robert Persaud, the
situation is not at a level, which has impacted banana production
negatively. The minister's disclosure has come in response to a
decision made by the Surinamese authorities to close routes across
the Corentyne River to protect their agricultural sector.

According to the minister, the reason advanced by the Surinamese
authorities is because the disease is suspected to be rampant in
Guyana and can devastate Suriname's agricultural sector, a revelation
the minister has rejected. He related that the disease is currently
being monitored and collaborative efforts between the Inter-American
Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA) Guyana, IICA
Suriname, and CHF [Canadian Hunger Foundation] have resulted in some
scientific work being done in advancing the understanding of the
disease. "This work has been unable to definitively identify and
confirm the disease-causing agent, but has made claims to have done
so," the minister noted.

Notwithstanding, he added that a series of disease management
strategies have been put in place in Guyana to minimize the incidence
of the disease and reduce its impact on production. These strategies
he said are also applicable to all agricultural materials entering
cross border trade. "I have since directed the chief crops and
livestock officer and the technical manager of the Plant Health
Services to travel to Suriname to hold discussions with counterparts
on ensuring effective cross border phytosanitary measures."

[A range of fungal, bacterial, and viral diseases is known to affect
banana in the region and could be involved in the problems in Guyana.
Outbreaks of fungal leaf spot diseases (black and/or yellow sigatoka;
ProMED-mail post 20090614.2204), and the bacterial Moko disease have
been reported from the adjacent Caribbean area, and the fungal panama
disease is re-emerging in the region. Further outbreaks of these
pathogens may be a possibility. While the cause of the disease seems
still under investigation, the establishment of cross border plant
quarantine measures would certainly appear to be a reasonable
precaution by neighbouring countries.
