I would like to make several comments regarding brucellosis and yersiniosis.
1. Yes, _B. melitensis_ is responsible for the majority of human infections
and is primarily food borne. Primary hosts for _B. melitensis_ are sheep
and goats. _B. abortus_ infection is generally sporadic and occurs in
people who work with cattle or pigs, respectively. It is also valid that
the general public generally acquires the infection including _B. abortus_
through the ingestion of unpasteurized milk and milk products. Our traveler
consumed milk and sheep milk cheese on the streets in Istanbul. I agree
with the professor that the cheese as the source of disease is unlikely,
but unpasteurized milk and brucellosis exist in Turkey, both _melitensis_
and _abortus_.
2. Clinical symptoms are generally not specific for brucellosis. The
possibility of brucellosis should be considered in any fever of unknown
origin in patients who recently traveled in endemic areas. Turkey is an
endemic area, and our traveler visited there. The patient developed the
flu-like symptoms of headache, myalgias, arthralgias, anorexia, malaise,
fatigue, fever and weight loss. The fever showed diurnal variation and came
and went over time.
3. In the laboratory, we found positive inflammatory indexes. In the blood,
leucopenia with lymphocytosis were found, and liver function tests were
abnormal. Hepatosplenomegaly was found by ultrasound. Lymphadenopathy was
found as well. No other infectious or non-infectious etiology of hepatitis
was found.
4. Serologically, high titers for brucellosis were found, and antibodies
against _Y. enterocolitica_ were lower. It is debatable whether infection
with _Y. enterocolitica_ was present, but brucellosis was definite. When we
have diagnosed extraintestinal yersiniosis in patients in previous years,
brucellosis titers have always been non-reactive.

woman did have brucellosis. This thread is cut. - Mod.LL]
