Flu traced to imported horses
-----------------------------
The outbreak of equine influenza in December 2003 highlighted numerous
shortcomings and inadequacies in security, manpower, training and
procedures, according to a report released on Thu, 24 Jun 2004.
These shortcomings contributed to the failure of the quarantine system to
contain the outbreak.
"A consultative engagement between the state veterinary services and the
equine industry must be urgently established in order to develop and
implement an appropriate equine bio-security system," concluded the report,
commissioned by the National Horseracing Authority (NHRA).
The report says control measures instituted during the outbreak were
reactionary and in general played a role in limiting the overall extent of
the incident.
However, in the absence of an integrated emergency management plan the
overall success of these measures was "remarkable".
"It is essential that the equine industry and State Veterinary Authorities
develop an integrated emergency management plan for implementation should
such an event recur," the NHRA said.
The report says the outbreak of equine influenza, which forced
cancellations of major equestrian events in the Western Cape, Gauteng and
Eastern Cape, was probably caused by a virus of American origin.
The virus isolated from the 2003 equine influenza outbreak was identified
by the World Reference Laboratory for Equine Influenza as identical to that
of a virus isolated in Wisconsin, United States the same year.
"The genetic similarities between the 2003 South African virus and the 2003
Wisconsin virus confirm that the virus responsible for the 2003 South
African outbreak originated in the USA in 2003," said the NHRA.
The report noted that a group of 32 horses were imported into South Africa
on 26 Nov 2003: 25 horses from the USA, 1 from Argentina, 3 from the United
Kingdom, 1 from France and 2 from the United Arab Emirates.
Of these, the equine influenza vaccination status of the horses from the UK
and UAE was satisfactory whereas that of the remaining 27 horses was
"sub-optimal".
The virus was most probably transmitted from the imported horses to South
African horses by indirect means -- by persons, vehicles or equipment.
The report recommended that to prevent major disruptions to organised
equestrian events in South Africa, regulatory bodies responsible for such
events should allow participation only of animals that have been adequately
vaccinated against equine influenza. Only vaccines meeting the minimum
standards described by the Veterinary World Health Organisation should be used.
Horses imported into South Africa need to be adequately vaccinated against
horse flu prior to leaving the country of origin, and the number of people
that come into contact with imported horses must be limited and must only
occur following necessary authorisation.

[2 subtypes of influenza A virus are known to cause influenza in horses,
namely the subtypes H7N7 (formerly known as A/equine 1) and H3N8 (formerly
known as A/equine 2). In recent years, most outbreaks have been associated
with the H3N8 subtype, however serological evidence of H7N7 infections
continues to be reported. Although these are not genuine human pathogens,
humans can become infected with equine influenza virus subtypes. Such
infections are unusual and subclinical, but may represent a potential
biohazard to laboratory personnel.
Both subtypes are generally included in commercial equine influenza
vaccines. Information on the vaccines is available in Chapter 2.5.5 of the
Manual of standards, Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines 2000 of the OIE:
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00073.htm>
and on the Equiflunet:
<http://195.224.162.216/equiflunet/equiflunet_vaccines.html>.
A review describing the circumstances surrounding the 1st outbreak and
spread of equine influenza in South Africa 18 years ago has been published
by Guthrie et al in Rev Sci Tech. 1999 Apr;18(1):179-85. Its abstract follows:
"Equine-2 influenza A virus (H3N8) infection first occurred among naive
horses in South Africa in December 1986. The virus was introduced following
the importation of 6 horses from the United States of America. While the
release of in-contact horses from quarantine 3 days after the arrival of
these 6 horses played a role in the rapid spread of the disease in South
Africa, other outbreaks of disease were associated with viral introduction
by personnel or contaminated instruments. The control measures and
implications of the introduction of equine influenza to South Africa are
also discussed".
Interestingly, the authors remark that during the outbreak, great concern
was expressed about the potential effects that equine influenza could have
on the large population of zebra (appx 50 000) that could not practically
be vaccinated against the disease. However, this did not happen, and later
serological evidence from zebras, as sentinels, lent support to the
contention that equine influenza was not present in South Africa at the
time of publication (1999). Unfortunately, this has recently changed. - Mod.AS]
