Australia: Dengue Fever in Cairns: Update
-----------------------------------------
There are now 85 confirmed cases of dengue fever in Cairns as of 19 Mar
2003. No cases have been reported outside of Cairns in this outbreak.
[Rosalie Spencer, Queensland Health - personal communication, 19 Mar 2003]
The areas currently affected are Parramatta Park, Manunda, Cairns North,
Yorkeys Knob, and Trinity Beach (1).
Since the outbreak began in February 2003 (2), the Dengue Action Response
Team (DART) has been conducting house-to-house checks in most inner city,
and some northern beaches suburbs, encouraging residents to eliminate
mosquito breeding sites around their yards and homes. The DART has also
been spraying household insecticide sprays inside homes and is advising
people in all affected and potentially affected areas to use mosquito coils
and repellents to avoid bites.
No cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) have been reported, but people
who acquired dengue in the last large outbreak in Cairns in 1997-99 would
be at risk of developing haemorrhagic fever if they caught dengue fever
again in this outbreak. DHF can occur when a person previously infected
with dengue becomes infected with a different dengue serotype, and is
potentially fatal.
Travellers to Australia are strongly reminded to take measures to prevent
mosquito bites to protect themselves against dengue fever and other
mosquito borne diseases. (See reference 2 for specific advice).

Australia: Dengue Outbreak Total Reaches 120 in North Queensland
---------------------------------------------------
The dengue fever epidemic in the northern Queensland city of Cairns
continues to spread, with the number of cases rising daily. Some 120
residents have now been infected by the potentially deadly mosquito-borne
illness.
The list of areas affected is also growing, with the suburbs of Machans
Beach and Westcourt the latest added. Most confirmed cases are still in the
inner suburbs of Parramatta Park and Manunda where the first cases were
detected almost a month ago.
Environmental officers from Thursday Island in the Torres Strait have
arrived to help the health authorities in Cairns to contain the outbreak.
