Fear of an unknown disease has gripped the remote villages in Patrapur block after death of 2 persons in the last 24 hours. As many as 20 others have also been afflicted.

A 5-year-old boy of Aliara village in Ankuli got a fever 4 days ago. When his condition did not improve, he was taken to Patrapur hospital on Saturday [27 Jun 2020] but succumbed.

Similarly, a 44-year-old woman of Hukuma village in Mandarada fell sick on Saturday [27 Jun 2020], but by the time the ambulance arrived, she had breathed her last. There were 2 other persons, including a child of Kuruguda village under Buratala panchayat, who have been showing similar flu-like symptoms.

As residents of villages like Ankuli and Mandarada depend on Patrapur hospital, which is about 10 km [6.2 mi] away, most of them depend on quacks.

After getting the information, health workers have collected blood samples of 10 persons on Sunday [28 Jun 2020] and provided medicines. A medical team will visit the villages soon, said Patrapur hospital sources.

[There is little information upon which to speculate on what the etiology of these febrile illnesses might be. Dengue is likely to be present in the area, as might be chikungunya and Zika viruses, but the latter 2 are seldom fatal for those infected as children. Japanese encephalitis virus is probably present as well, but no mention is made of encephalitis. One child was reported to have a flu-like illness. There is currently a major SARS-CoV-2 outbreak going on in India (567 536 cumulative cases as of 29 Jun 2020 20:42 GMT; https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) that can cause flu-like cases, but children are seldom fatally affected. ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving any additional clinical information, case numbers, and details of laboratory results. - Mod.TY
