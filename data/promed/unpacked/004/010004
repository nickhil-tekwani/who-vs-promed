Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), or monkey fever, has claimed one more life in Wayanad [district] in Kerala, taking the death toll due the tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever so far this year [2019] in the district to 2.

The deceased has been identified as [a 23-year-old] native of Appapara near Thirunelli. According to health department officials, [the man] had been living with family near Bairakuppa in Karnataka after his marriage, and he was bought to the district hospital at Mananthavady in a serious condition on [Sun 28 Apr 2019].

"The patient was brought to the hospital in a serious condition on [Sun 28 Apr 2019], and he died within 2 hours. We have come to know that he had undergone treatment for fever at Virajpet and HD Kote in Karnataka before he was brought to the district hospital," Wayanad district medical officer (DMO) Dr R Renuka said.

It is suspected that the deceased had contracted the disease from Bairakuppa, which is a KFD hotspot in the current outbreak.

[A 27-year-old] resident of the Begur tribal hamlet in Wayanad, died on [23 Mar 2019], marking the 1st KFD death in the state after 2015. There have been 6 confirmed cases of KFD in the district so far this year [2019], including one case from Karnataka.

Dr Renuka said that it is a matter of concern that most of the cases were being reported from among people near the Appapara and Begur areas.

The department has also intensified disease surveillance and precautionary steps including dusting with insecticides in areas where monkey deaths have been reported.

Wayanad has witnessed KFD cases for 4 years in a row, from 2013 onwards till 2016, and the disease had claimed 11 lives in its largest outbreak in the state in 2015.

KFD is transmitted primarily through bites of infected ticks (_Haemaphysalis spinigera_). The KFD outbreaks coincide with high nymphal activity of _H. spinigera_ ticks -- the main vector of the disease -- during the dry months from January to May.

[Wayanad is a rural district in the northeast part of Kerala. A large area of the district is covered by forest https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayanad_district.

Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family _Flaviviridae_, characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The virus was 1st identified in 1957 after it was isolated from a sick monkey from the Kyasanur Forest in Karnataka state of India. The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey [https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html].

KFD typically occurs during the dry season from November through May, which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. The recommended preventive measures include using tick repellents, walking along clear trails, avoiding contact with weeds, and wearing full sleeved clothes and long pants to reduce exposed skin to reduce contact with ticks and subsequent tick bites, as well as the use of personal protective equipment and vaccination. - Mod.UBA
