Hepatitis B continues to kill people in Moyo
--------------------------------------------
Despite efforts by health officials in Moyo District to check the
spread of Hepatitis B that broke out last year, more people have
continued to die from the deadly disease. Now, health officials have
confirmed that 4 people have so far died of the virus with 74
infections since last year [2010].

The district disease surveillance officer, Mr Simon Amudra, said many
of the cases are not reported in the health facilities. He said more
intensive sensitisation on the signs and symptoms like general body
weakness, fever, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, loss of appetite and
vomiting needs to be increased in the communities.

The newly infected 24 cases admitted to isolation ward at Moyo
hospital since January this year have been discharged after
improvement to avoid further infections.

Hepatitis B virus mainly affects the liver.
