1st Report of Bean pod mottle virus in Soybean in Iran.

Soybean (_Glycine max_ (L.) Merr.) has been increasing in importance
and acreage for the past 5 years in Iran and is now planted on
approximately 108 000 ha. Previous surveys in Iran of viruses
infecting soybean failed to identify Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV),
but the incidence of other common viruses of soybean in the field has
been reported (1).

During October 2004, symptoms characteristic of those caused by BPMV
including mosaic, puckering of trifoliate leaves, and delayed
maturity of stems or green stems were observed in soybean fields in
the Takhti Mahaleh, Versen, and Hashemabad areas located in Gorgan
Province [Gorgan is the capital of Golestan Province]. Sporadic
incidence of plants infected with BPMV has been usually of minor
importance to growers. Symptoms were often overlooked or considered
to be physiological disorders.

A visual assessment was made to determine incidence of green stem in
the commonly grown soybean cv. Sahar. 40 soybean plants showing
symptoms of crinkling, mottling, green stem, and retaining green
leaves were sampled by collecting one trifoliate leaf near the top of
the plant. All samples were tested in parallel for BPMV using
double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(DAS-ELISA).

BPMV was detected in 40 percent of the samples. 7 of the samples
shown to be infected with BPMV using DAS-ELISA were mechanically (2)
transferred to soybean seedlings in the greenhouse. These plants
developed systemic mottle symptoms typical of those caused by BPMV
and tested positive for BPMV using DAS-ELISA.

The distribution of BPMV within soybean-growing regions, exploration
of potential virus reservoirs, and economic impact of this virus have
yet to be determined. There is no published report on the presence of
potential BPMV vectors including the bean leaf beetle (_Cerotoma
trifurcata_) from soybean fields in Iran.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of BPMV in Iran.

[BPMV causes significant crop losses in soybean. It is spread
primarily by the bean leaf beetle _Cerotoma trifurcata_ (bean leaf
beetle), _Colaspis brunnea_ (grape colaspis), _Diabrotica balteata_,
and southern corn root worm (_D. undecimpunctata_). BPMV is stable,
easily transmitted mechanically and occurs at relatively high levels
in seed coats from seeds of infected soybean. Yields from infected
plants are lowered by 10-40 percent, grain quality is reduced both in
oil and protein, seed germination is lower and delayed maturation
results in a condition known as 'green stem.'

The fact that BPMV has been reported in Iran is interesting,
suggesting that infected seed may have been used for planting. This
report may be the 1st finding of BPMV outside of North America. If
any of our readers know of other BPMV outbreaks in soybean, please
let me know.
