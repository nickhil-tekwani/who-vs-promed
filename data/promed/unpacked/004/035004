An outbreak of lettuce wilt and root rot caused by _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _lactucae_ was reported in the UK for the 1st time in early October [2017] at an unconfirmed location. The pathogen was identified as Race 4 which is a particularly aggressive strain of the fungus with no known treatment or varietal resistance available to date. UK propagators and growers are advised to review their protocols, particularly crop hygiene. Prompt diagnosis is recommended, services are available at several UK research organisations.

[The] disease was first described in Japan in 1955. [It] was then detected in other Asian countries, the USA, and finally in Europe (initially Italy [ProMED-mail post 20020821.5103] and Portugal, and since confirmed in France, the Netherlands, and Belgium).

Up until now, the pathogen had been contained in mainland Europe, [where it] is considered one of the limiting factors for commercial lettuce production during summer. In Italy for example, up to 70 per cent losses have been observed. Infection may lead to total destruction of the crop. Growers in the Netherlands [ProMED-mail post 20151022.3734467] and Belgium have been battling with [the] strain [and] some growers have been obliged to stop growing lettuce in infested structures during summer.

Disease control is extremely difficult since spores survive for a long time in soil and crop debris. There are no effective fungicides and soil sterilisation has limited efficacy. Therefore, avoidance is the best strategy.

[Fusarium wilt of lettuce caused by the fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _lactucae_ (synonym _lactucum_) can affect plants of any age. Symptoms include leaf yellowing, tip burn and necrosis, as well as browning of vascular tissues and rotting of the tap root. Plants may be stunted and fail to form heads, infected seedlings wilt and may die. Disease incidence can range from a few plants up to large areas within a field.

The pathogen occurs in soils worldwide and is commonly found on roots of healthy plants. Most strains cause no damage to their hosts, but severe strains can block the water conducting xylem and lead to wilting. 3 races are known to cause disease in lettuce, with up to 70 per cent crop losses reported. Lettuce cultivars have been reported to differ significantly in susceptibility, with some leaf and romaine types highly resistant. Disease severity may also depend on fungal populations in the soil, inoculum levels and temperatures. Once introduced to an area, the fungi may survive indefinitely on the roots of asymptomatic reservoir hosts. Thus, resistant lettuce varieties and rotation crops can contribute to an increase in soil inoculum.

Spread occurs mainly on contaminated seed, with soil, infected crop debris, irrigation water, and human activities (for example on farm machinery and tools). Disease management requires an integrated approach including crop rotation and phytosanitary measures (including steam treatment of soil) to avoid spread to new fields. For related fusarium pathogens, flooding of fields has been reported to reduce fungal survival in the soil.

Different strains of the fungus cause wilting diseases with serious losses in other crops, such as banana (Panama disease), guava, vanilla, date palm, and a range of cucurbits. Each pathovar is highly specialised attacking only a single crop species.
