EU agencies to advise on risks from phenylbutazone in horsemeat
---------------------------------------------------------------
The European Commission has asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to carry out a joint assessment of the risks to human health from the presence in horsemeat of residues of the anti-inflammatory drug phenylbutazone. The request follows the recent identification of beef products contaminated with horsemeat and the discovery of phenylbutazone -- also known as "bute" -- in a small number of horse carcasses intended for the food chain.

The European Union agencies will provide scientific advice by 15 Apr 2013 to help inform decision-making of the European Commission with regard to these recent findings. In carrying out the joint risk assessment, the 2 agencies will use all available scientific evidence and consider data and results of ongoing testing of horsemeat in member states as these become available.

In a joint statement, EFSA and EMA will provide advice on any potential risk for consumers arising from the presence of phenylbutazone residues in horsemeat. In this regard, the agencies will consider both the risk posed from consumption of horsemeat itself as well as that arising from other products illegally contaminated with horsemeat. The agencies have been asked to advise, where appropriate, if additional control options are needed to minimise any risks identified.

Phenylbutazone is used sparingly in human medicine for the treatment of severe inflammatory conditions where no other treatment is considered suitable. In veterinary medicine its use is permitted in some Member States for pain relief and to reduce inflammation in non-food producing animals (dogs, sport horses).

Phenylbutazone is not permitted to be used in the treatment of animals destined for the human food chain and any presence of the substance in food of animal origin therefore results from the illegal use of carcasses of treated horses.
