2000/025 First report of tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus in Morocco
In July 1998, tomato plants showing shortened internodes, reduced leaf size
and leaf curling were observed in the coastal region near Casablanca,
Morocco. In September 1998, more than 130 ha of outdoor and protected
tomato crops were affected by the disease. Crop losses ranged between 20 to
100 %. Similar symptoms were also seen in tomato crops in the north-eastern
region of Morocco. During the same period, high populations of Bemisia
tabaci (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) were observed on tomatoes, capsicums and
weeds (_Sonchus oleraceus_, _Chenopodium_, _Malva parviflora_, _Datura
stramonium_). Tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest)
was identified by PCR in symptomatic tomato samples. This is the first
report of tomato yellow leaf curl begomovirus in Morocco. The authors noted
that during the 1996/97 growing season, similar symptoms had already been
observed by a farmer in the Casablanca region on imported, grafted tomatoes.

[Based on nucleic sequencing of isolates of tomato yellow leaf curl virus
(TYLCV) from Reunion Island, Dominican Republic, Spain, and Cuba, the
authors concluded that the Moroccan isolate is a member of the Israeli
species and most closely related to the Dominican Republic isolate. TYLCV
also occurs in Portugal. The EPPO report is correct but incomplete about
the first observation of the disease in Morocco. I note from the original
abstract (Petterschmitt et al., 1999. First report of tomato yellow leaf
curl geminivirus in Morocco. Plant Disease 83: 1074) that the virus was
imported into Morocco on grafted tomato plants from the Netherlands by a
farmer near Casablanca. - Mod.DH
