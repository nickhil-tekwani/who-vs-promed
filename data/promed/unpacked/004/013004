In New Zealand's temperate climate, the national dairy herd is
predominantly spring-calving and as a result, salmonella has a peak
occurrence at this time of year. This New Zealand spring, the National
Animal Health Information Surveillance programme detected a change in
the overall picture of salmonella in New Zealand dairy cattle: an
increase in the incidence of uncommonly reported salmonella serotypes
in cattle and a moderate increase in laboratory case counts for
salmonella in cattle.

These findings were further supported by anecdotal reports of a more
severe clinical expression and reduced vaccination effect in dairy
cattle occurring over the last 2 seasons.

All salmonellae isolated in New Zealand animal health laboratories are
typed at the National Environmental Science and Research (ESR) Enteric
Reference Laboratory, which collates and reports both human and
non-human salmonella sero and phagetyping results. The national
database of salmonella isolates has not shown any associated rise in
human salmonella cases. ESR reports can be accessed at:
http://www.surv.esr.cri.nz/enteric_reference/enteric_reference.php.

Salmonella information is also included in annual reports in the
Surveillance magazine:
http://www.biosecurity.govt.nz/publications/surveillance/index.htm.

For New Zealand dairy products, any food safety risk continues to be
effectively managed by the existing dairy industry milk collection and
processing standards applied within each operation's MAF-approved food
safety risk management programme.

The initial surveillance findings have triggered a programme of work
to inform future management strategies, initially defining any problem
that may exist through farmer and veterinary surveys. MAF is working
closely with the Dairy Companies Association of New Zealand and dairy
industry veterinarians. In addition, the Massey University Epicentre
is undertaking a preliminary epidemiological study to identify risk
factors.
