DIARRHEAL DISEASE, FATAL - KENYA (TANA RIVER): REQUEST FOR INFO
****************************************************************************
************
A ProMED-mail post
<http://www.healthnet.org/programs/promed.html>

We have heard a rumor that an epidemic of diarrhoeal disease, possibly Rift
Valley fever, with a number of deaths, began in Jan 1999 in the Tana River
District of Kenya.
If anyone can give us further information, we would be grateful.
