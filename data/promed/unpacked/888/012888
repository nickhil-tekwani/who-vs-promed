In Cherkassy province a 38-year-old man developed anthrax from butchering pig carcasses. This was reported by the press service of the State Ministry of Emergencies in Cherkassy region. [Spelling of Cherkasy/Cherkassy/Cherkassi varies. - Mod.MHJ]

The incident occurred in the city of Zvenigorodka-Razdelnaya. The pork butcher had a cutaneous arm lesion and went to the district hospital where he was diagnosed with "anthrax". Doctors have collected materials for research in the laboratory of particularly dangerous infections. During the subsequent tests _Bacillus anthracis_ was cultured, the cause of anthrax, according to Glavred.

The patient was hospitalized in the infectious disease clinic and his condition is satisfactory. Meanwhile, experts from the public health centers and Veterinary Service are investigating to determine the source of transmission.

[Anthrax is truly sporadic in the Ukraine. Human cases are erratic and reflect the low risk and the non-reporting of moribund or acutely dead livestock. The last cases in pigs were in Odessa in 2005 and 2006; it has been 10 years since the last equine case; the last case in a sheep or goat was in Khar'kov in 2005; there was a bovine case in Khmel'nitskiy in 2006, cases in 2007 in Ivan-Frankorsk, Kharkov, Odessa, and Zakarpats'ka; and a single outbreak in Chermernivtsi in 2010. None in 2011.

Porcine cases, without any other information, are hard to decipher. In commercial piggeries it is a strong indicator of contaminated livestock feed. In small holdings it can reflect scavenging pigs feeding on dead livestock, otherwise unreported, or when fed the viscera from same when butchered. In certain cultures pigs are let out during the day to wander the streets feeding on tossed garbage, which they do with enthusiasm; they return at night to be housed.

However the spelling can vary and Zvenihorodka is south west of Cherkasy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvenyhorodka). - Mod.MHJ]
