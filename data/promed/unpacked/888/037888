Something is causing young penguins in South Africa and Argentina to
lose their feathers.

The condition was first seen in black-footed penguins in a
rehabilitation centre in South Africa in 2006. The following year it
was found in wild Magellanic penguins, living on the other side of the
Atlantic in Argentina. Wild penguins in South Africa have also been
affected.

It has been seen in chicks, who normally go through several moults
before growing their adult plumage. In both species, chicks did not
immediately replace one coat after moulting, and instead spent several
weeks partially or wholly bald. If they survived, the chicks did
eventually grow a new coat, but in the interim being bald put them at
increased risk of exposure (Waterbirds (2010) 33(3): 415-21).

Nola Parsons of the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation
of Coastal Birds in Cape Town, where the condition was first seen,
says it is probably caused by an infection: there is no evidence for a
parasite, malnutrition, or stress.

But the culprit has proven elusive, so last year [2010] Parsons took
a swathe of samples from affected penguins. She is arranging to send
them to Greg Cunningham of St John Fisher College in Rochester, New
York, who will try to identify what's causing the disease. Parsons
says that so far it is not a major threat: most penguins appear to
recover and the condition is not becoming more common. But she points
out that it is likely to be an emerging disease, and could escalate.

[This 1st report of feather-loss disease in African penguins in 2006
and in Argentina in 2007 suggests the disorder is new. For African
penguins at the rehabilitation center in 2006, 2007, and 2008, 7
percent, 18 percent, and 11 percent of chicks lost feathers
respectively, while feather loss disease is rarer in Magellanic
penguins, with only 13 cases found from over 20 000 chicks checked in
2007 and 2008.

Feather loss disorder disrupts the penguins' ability to maintain
their body temperatures. Researchers have observed featherless
penguins basking in the warm -- but harmful -- midday sun while their
feathered cohorts sought protection in the shade. In Antarctic
penguins such as the black-footed penguin, feather loss can lead to
death from hypothermia.

Penguins with feather loss in this study were found to grow more
slowly and are smaller in size and weight than normal penguins. South
African featherless chicks took 16 days longer to reach release weight
than feathered chicks. Possible causes of feather loss in birds
include pathogens, thyroid disorders, nutrient imbalances, or
genetics. But the authors of this study believe that malnutrition is
not the cause, as the captured penguins were in good body condition,
fed appropriate foods, and given vitamin supplements.

It is still unknown whether the feather loss in South African and
Magellanic penguins is related or not.

Although unrelated, psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD) is a
viral disease that also causes feather loss in birds. PBFD is caused
by the psittacine circovirus and is specific to psittacine birds such
as parrots, parakeets, cockatoos, macaws, and lovebirds. Transmission
of the virus is through direct contact, inhalation, and ingestion. The
virus is very stable in the environment and can survive for many
months in feather dust, feces, and nest materials. Symptoms of PBFD
are irreversible feather loss, shedding of developing feathers,
development of abnormal feathers and coloration, pinched feathers, and
loss of powder down [plus gross beak deformities]. There is no
specific treatment for PBFD and the disease has now been reported in
over 42 wild and captive psittacine species from all continents.

[It is to be hoped that Greg Cunningham's lab in New York state will
be able to test for a possible new circovirus. ProMED would like to
know the diagnosis. Does anybody know if the ranges of the 2 penguin
species overlap anywhere, to account for the condition spanning the
Atlantic? - Mod.JW]
