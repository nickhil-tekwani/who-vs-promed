Dolphin deaths in Panhandle area reach 38; feds investigate
------------------------------------------------
The National Marine Fisheries Service launched a federal
investigation Tuesday into the high number of dolphins recently found
dead along Panhandle bays and beaches, calling it an "unusual
mortality event." Officials said the number of confirmed dead has
reached 38.
The Fisheries Service is overseeing testing of the carcasses at a lab
in St.Petersburg.
Ron Hardy, the onsite coordinator for the investigation, said
symptoms resemble the effects of red tide, a toxic algae known to
kill sea life when it blooms in [high] concentrations.
Wendy Noke, a researcher with Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute in
Orlando, said the dolphins appeared to be in good nutritional
condition when they died, and the cause of death "appeared to be
somewhat catastrophic."
Reports of dead redfish, lightning whelks, and horseshoe crabs in the
area also would seem to point to a toxin such as red tide. Officials
said initial test results may be available as early as Wednesday.
Cape San Blas is about 85 miles southwest of Tallahassee.
