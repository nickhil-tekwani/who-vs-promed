Southern Brazil soybean yield offsetting losses
----------------------------------------------------
Higher than expected soybean yields in south Brazil due to favorable
weather compensate for losses caused by Asian rust disease in the
center-west and northeast, industry sources said on Thursday.
In Parana state, Brazil's [second largest] soybean producer, yields are
expected to rise to 3050 kg per hectare, from 2800 kg/ha in 2002, said Vera
Zardo, chief agronomist at the Parana State Rural Economy Department
(Deral). Parana's soybean output is expected to rise to 10.8 million
tonnes, from 9.4 million tonnes in 2001/02, due to a 9 per cent increase in
area to 3.56 million hectares, Ocepar said.
In Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's [third largest] soybean producer, the
average yield is seen rising to 2460 kg/ha from 1703 kg in 2001/02,
according to FecoAgro, the state agricultural cooperative association, and
could reach 3000 kg/ha because of favorable weather and use of crop
protection agents.
Increased output in Parana and Rio Grande do Sul should compensate for
production losses in Mato Grosso and Bahia due to Asian rust fungus and wet
weather.
Together with an increase in the soybean area to 3.53 million ha, from 3.29
million, production in Rio Grande do Sul may reach 8.69 million tonnes, up
from 5.61 million in 2001/02.
According to Amado de Oliveira, special advisor to the secretary for rural
development in Mato Grosso, yield is estimated at 12-12.3 million tonnes,
less than expected. In 2001/02, Mato Grosso grew 11.6 million tonnes of
soybeans. Olivera said that rust and rains could reduce average yield to 52
(60-kg) bags/ha, from 55 bags forecast initially.
Last week, the government's agricultural research agency Embrapa said that
1.8 million tonnes of soybeans could be lost in Mato Grosso and 415 000
tonnes in Bahia due to Asian rust.

[_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ [Pr], the fungus that causes Asian soybean rust,
has spread to almost all of Brazil's large soybean belt in the last 2
years. There is increased focus on the disease in South America, especially
in light of demands by the American Soybean Association that the United
States Department of Agriculture ban imports of soybean from Brazil to the
USA in order to prevent introduction of Pr into the USA. Brazil is second
to the USA in soybean production and exports. The concern to producers in
North America is that rust spores will eventually spread to the southern
states of the US. Chemical control is an expensive option, and breeding
programs for disease resistance to Pr are in progress. - Mod.DH]
