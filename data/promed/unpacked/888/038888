TSE, NATIVE CERVIDS - USA
=========================
Date: Mon, 5 May 1997

Judging from recent postings, it appears there's need for clarification on
several questions and issues related to chronic wasting disease (CWD), a
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) of North American deer and elk.

CWD has been recognized in captive deer (and subsequently elk) in wildlife
research facilities in Colorado and Wyoming since the late 1960's; this
disease was subsequently diagnosed in free-ranging elk and deer in
northcentral Colorado and southeastern Wyoming. CWD shares many common
features of other TSEs.
CWD is similar in some respects to scrapie of sheep and goats and to bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, "mad cow disease"), but all data gathered to
date indicate CWD is distinct from these other 2 disease entities. Although
the origin and etiologic agent of CWD are unknown, BSE does not occur in
native North American cattle and CWD is clearly not "mad cow disease" in
deer and elk. Moreover, there are no data indicating CWD can be transmitted
naturally to species other than mule deer,
white-tailed deer, and elk.
Based on our epizootiological investigations to date, CWD is transmitted
among deer and elk through direct or indirect contact -- feed contamination
does not appear to play any role in maintaining CWD in either captive or
free-ranging cervid populations. Responsible state wildlife management
agencies, in strong collaboration with university and federal scientists,
are continuing a wide range of investigations to learn more about CWD
epizootiology, diagnosis, and management.
We in Colorado and Wyoming regard CWD as a serious potential threat to
native wildlife resources, and are also seeking to clarify its implications
for livestock and human health. Considerable information has been and will
continue to be published on CWD, and we encourage those interested to stay
abreast of the available literature. Two recent references may be of
particular interest:

Williams & Young. 1992. Spongiform encephalopathies of Cervidae. Sci. Tech.
Rev. Off. Int. Epiz. 11: 551-567.

Spraker, et al. 1997. Spongiform encephalopathy in free-ranging mule deer,
white-tailed deer, and Rocky Mountain elk in northcentral Colorado. J.
Wildl. Dis. 33: 1-6.

We hope the foregoing rectifies misperceptions that may have arisen from
previous postings.
