[Given this is a new disease for Northern Europe, it is not surprising it
is spreading quickly, almost 30 premises each for both the Netherlands and
Germany. In fact, if animal health authorities can control or limit the
spread to some degree of this arthropodborne virus in a season when the
vector is present, their accomplishment would be significant. - Mod.PC]
