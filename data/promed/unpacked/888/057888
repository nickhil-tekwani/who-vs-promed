Cherokee County officials are testing more cats and kittens for rabies, after an infected kitten bit 7 people. At least 4 cats have been tested so far; another remains in quarantine.

The testing comes after a stray kitten died of rabies last week. The kitten bit 7 people, who are now undergoing rabies treatment. On Tuesday [13 Mar 2012], Channel 2's Diana Davis talked to one of those victims, a veterinarian who is undergoing treatment. The veterinarian said she has been in her profession for 22 years. She knows all the signs and symptoms but said the stray cat that bit her didn't show any of them.

"She was acting like any other feral cat. She was scared, but she was friendly," the veterinarian told Davis. "She was just purring and rubbing on you," she said. But it didn't take long for the behavior of the stray cat she was hoping to adopt to quickly change. The cat bit her badly on her 2 fingers, she said. "My left index finger, she just kind of got me all around that joint around the knuckle, then she latched on to the middle finger." The cat died, after the state health lab confirmed it had rabies, she said.

The stray was discovered at a Canton Starbucks on Riverstone Parkway. Now, the veterinarian and 6 others who played with the stray kitten and were bitten or scratched are being treated for rabies with a series of shots. The veterinarian said they are halfway through the end of their treatments and are doing fine.

Cherokee health officials now know the rabid kitten was just one in a colony of feral cats living in the woods behind a shopping center. The dumpsters are adjacent to apartments with several children, Davis said.

At least 4 cats have been sent to the state health lab for testing. Meanwhile, officials fear more people may have been infected with rabies. Anyone who believes they may have been exposed to the virus is asked to call the state health lab.

Rabies is commonly carried by raccoons, skunks and foxes. Health officials advise that all household pets, including cats, dogs and ferrets, be vaccinated once a year.

[Rabies in cats is less often reported than in domestic dogs or susceptible terrestrial wild animals, which, in the southern states, are likely to be raccoons. Also, the early clinical signs of rabies in cats can be variable, and atypical presentations are reputed to be more common than typical ones, which may explain why the 1st victim was an experienced veterinarian.
