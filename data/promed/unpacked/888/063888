ROSS RIVER VIRUS - AUSTRALIA (QUEENSLAND)

Unusually high numbers of mosquitoes are spreading the debilitating
Ross River virus across the state, with the number of cases soaring
by almost 300 percent.
The virus is usually more prevalent in the tropical north, but
figures show the number of people infected in the southern Brisbane
area in the past 4 weeks is almost 450 percent higher than in the
same period last year [2006].
Health bosses are warning people to take precautions against being
bitten and are stepping up spraying programs to tackle the problem.
They say the long dry spell and the unseasonable downpours at the end
of last month [August 2007] have caused mosquitoes to breed 3 months early.
New figures released to The Sunday Mail by Queensland Health reveal
there were 93 reported cases of Ross River infection in the past 4
weeks, compared with an average 32 cases in the same period for each
of the past 5 years [2002-2006].
North of Mackay, 30 cases were reported; 32 in the central area,
which takes in central Queensland and extends south to Brisbane,
north of the river; and 31 cases were reported in the southern area,
which runs from south of the river in Brisbane to the New South Wales border.
The southern Brisbane figures compare with just 7 in the same period
last year [2006]. Dozens more cases are believed to have gone
unrecorded or undiagnosed.
Queensland Health said the numbers were unusually high for this time
of year, with the highest numbers usually occurring in late summer
and early autumn.
Symptoms of Ross River virus include a mild fever, rash, and joint
pain, which is similar to arthritis.
Dr Michael Whitby, an infection spokesman for the Australian Medical
Association Queensland, said symptoms could vary but the disease
could often become debilitating, causing people to take months off work.
"Unfortunately there is no vaccine available, and the arthritis
treatment doesn't often do any good," he said. "All people can really
do is to wait until it goes away. This can take 3 months or sometimes
even longer."
The infection cannot be spread from human to human but can be spread
from animals to humans via mosquitoes. It is confirmed with a blood
test taken by a GP.
Councils across the state are already spending millions in a bid to
control the mosquitoes before the summer hits. Aerial and land-based
spraying has already been carried out across the state, on tidal
drains and sites near water.
Health officers at Brisbane City Council have launched an AUD 3.4
million [USD 3 million] mosquito prevention program after receiving
about 120 complaints about mosquitoes since 1 Sep 2007, with most
from residents in suburbs beside salt marsh areas from Deagon to Wynnum West.
A Brisbane City Council spokesman said: "The rain in August 2007
generated widespread hatching of Brisbane's salt marsh mosquitoes
across all the tidal areas from Brighton to Tingalpa. There has also
been much activity from a range of freshwater breeding mosquito
species right across the city and southeast Queensland."
The spokesman urged residents to be vigilant around their homes.
"Container-breeding mosquitoes are very active right now after the
rain and will use any receptacle that holds water," he said. "We
advise that any drums or buckets being used to store water should be
covered, and any rubbish that holds water should be discarded.
Mosquito screens on tanks, on both inlet and overflow pipes, should
also be checked and kept in place."
On the Sunshine Coast, councils are dumping large amounts of
hormone-laced sand on mosquito breeding grounds as part of an AUD one
million [USD 885 000] outbreak prevention project.
The hormone, which stunts the growth of juvenile mosquitoes but
doesn't harm other insects, was dropped in Caloundra, Buderim,
Bli-Bli, Coolum, Noosa, Noosa's North Shore and Peregian Beach.

[Mod. CP provided an excellent summary of the Ross River virus
situation in Australia in archive no. 20040403.0916:
"Epidemics of benign polyarthritis were recorded in Australia as
early as 1927, and the etiologic agent was isolated in 1963. Ross
River virus was shown to be a mosquito-transmitted virus belonging to
the genus _Alphavirus_ of the family _Togaviridae_. Ross River virus
is endemic in most coastal regions of Australia and since the 1980's
appears to have extended its geographical range to include most of
the island communities of the South Pacific. The animal reservoir
species are various, and humans exhibit a significant viraemia such
that some epidemics are maintained in a human-mosquito-human
transmission cycle. The mosquito vectors vary according to the local
environment. Fortunately, illness in humans -- although occasionally
prolonged and painful -- is not fatal, and recovery is complete."
Although recovery from Ross River virus infection is complete,
symptoms may persist for years. With high incidence of Ross River
virus infection early this spring [2007], one wonders whether virus
transmission will accelerate as warmer spring to summer conditions
progress. ProMED requests further information about this year's
outbreak and the effectiveness of hormone (presumably target-specific
insect juvenile hormone) wetland treatment for vector mosquito
control as it becomes available.
