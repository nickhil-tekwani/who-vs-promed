[The following information was obtained from the fact sheet "Dourine", prepared by The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/dourine.pdf (last update September 2015):

"Dourine is a serious, often chronic, venereal disease of horses and other equids. This protozoal infection can result in neurological signs and emaciation, and the case fatality rate is high. No vaccine is available, and the long-term efficacy of treatment is uncertain.

"Dourine is caused by the protozoan parasite _Trypanosoma equiperdum_ (subgenus Trypanozoon, Salivarian section). It is very closely related to the causative agents of African trypanosomiasis (_Trypanosoma brucei_, and surra (_T. evansi_), and whether it should be considered a distinct species is controversial. Strains of _T. equiperdum_ appear to differ in pathogenicity.

"Dourine mainly affects horses, donkeys and mules. These species appear to be the only natural reservoirs for _T. equiperdum_. Zebras have tested positive by serology, but there is no conclusive evidence of infection. Naturally occurring infections or clinical cases have not been reported in other species. It is difficult to infect healthy laboratory animals directly with isolates from equids, but mice immunosuppressed with glucocorticoids were more susceptible, and some rabbits were infected by intratesticular inoculation. Sheep, goats, dogs, rabbits, rats and mice can be infected with mouse-adapted strains, and may develop clinical signs. However, ruminants do not seem to be susceptible to isolates from equids, and a recent attempt to inoculate dogs with samples from horses also failed.

"There is no evidence that _T. equiperdum_ can infect humans.

"Dourine was once widespread, but it has been eradicated from many countries. Diagnosing dourine can be difficult, especially where other trypanosomes are also present, and the current distribution of this organism is unclear. Between 1995 and 2015, published papers and reports to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) suggested that this disease is endemic in parts of Africa and Asia. _T. equiperdum_ is also reported to exist in South America, although there is little or no recent information from this region. In addition, dourine may occur in some areas where testing is not done." - Mod.CRD
