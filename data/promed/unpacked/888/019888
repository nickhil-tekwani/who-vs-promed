Report on the measles situation in Portugal
-------------------------------------------
A measles case, imported from the United Kingdom
(UK), was reported in Portugal in late August
2008. Previously, measles cases imported from
Romania, and import-related cases, were reported
in 2005. There was no transmission to the autochthonous Portuguese population.

Background
-------------
Measles vaccination in Portugal started with a
national campaign in 1973 and was included in the
National Vaccination Program (PNV) in 1974. Since
1990, it consists of 2 doses of measles vaccine
in the form of the combined measles, mumps and
rubella vaccine (MMR), with the 1st dose at the
age of 15 months and the 2nd dose at the age of
11-13 years, The latter was changed to the age of 5-6 years in 2000 [1,2].

In 2001/2002, the seropositivity of the general
Portuguese population against measles was of 95.2
percent, with a vaccination coverage of 95-98
percent and a seroconversion efficacy of 90-95%
[1]. The high vaccination coverage has since been
maintained and the last 2 confirmed cases of
reported indigenous measles in the autochthonous
Portuguese population occurred in 2002 and 2003,
respectively. In August 2008, and previously in
2005, imported and import-related measles cases
affecting children of foreign origin, have been
reported in Portugal. Viral transmission was
contained in both instances and the virus was not
transmitted within the autochthonous Portuguese population.

In August 2008, and previously in 2005, imported
and import-related measles cases affecting
children of foreign origin, have been reported in
Portugal. Viral transmission was contained in
both instances and the virus was not transmitted
within the autochthonous Portuguese population.

Case in 2008
-----------------
In late August 2008, the Portuguese
Directorate-General of Health was notified of a
possible measles case in the Algarve Region,
located in the south of the country. The
notification was 1st made to the local health
authority by a private paediatrician who had seen
a 6-year-old British child on 25 Aug 2008,
following onset of measles-like symptoms on 21
Aug 2008 and development of a rash on 23 Oct
2008. Epidemiological investigations were
immediately initiated and included laboratory
detection and characterisation of the virus.

The child had travelled from the UK on 17 Aug
2008, on vacation with both parents and 2
siblings aged 11 and 14 years. Both parents were
vaccinated against measles. The 3 children were
unvaccinated, and the patient's siblings received
a post-exposure dose of MMR on 26 Aug 2008.

The case was confirmed by detection of
anti-measles IgM in the serum and by the presence
of viral genome in a urine specimen. The virus
was classified as genotype D4, and 449 out of 450
nucleotides encoding the C-terminal region of the
nucleoprotein were identical to the genotype D4
strain MVs/Enfield.GRB/14.07 presently
circulating in the UK [3]. This finding, and the
fact that during the viral incubation period the
child was still in England, identifies the case as imported from the UK.

Cases in 2005
-----------------
In June 2005, an imported measles case had been
reported, resulting in an outbreak affecting 6
children in 2 Romanian communities living in
Portugal. Epidemiological investigations
identified as the probable index case a child who
had travelled from Romania to Portugal a week
before rash onset. The other 5 children were
epidemiologically linked to the index case and
all presented clinical symptoms compatible with
measles virus infection. Their measles
immunisation status was unknown. All 6 cases were
laboratory-confirmed by detection of anti-measles
IgM in the sera and the presence of viral genome
in oral and urine specimens. The virus was
classified as genotype D4. A 200 nucleotide
region encoding the C-terminal portion of the
nucleoprotein was sequenced and showed 100
percent similarity to a genotype D4 viral strain
concurrently circulating in Romania.

Discussion
-------------
The elimination of indigenous measles has been
achieved in Portugal by steady high vaccination
coverage (ca. 95 percent) and by strict
implementation of disease control measures. The
high anti-measles seropositivity of the general
Portuguese population and the rapid investigation
and control of the described imported and
import-related cases, have permitted to contain
viral transmission and contributed to the absence
of reported cases within the autochthonous Portuguese population since 2003.

Measles did not become endemic again in Portugal
in 2005, or in 2008, and the phylogenetic
analysis of both imported viruses revealed different geographical origins.

The importation of measles cases remains a public
health concern, because pockets of low
vaccination coverage (85-94 percent) still
persist in the population, thereby maintaining a
possibility of acquiring the disease [1].
Globally, importation of measles cases and
subsequent outbreaks as reported by several
European countries in the last years, and with a
very high incidence in 2008 [4-11], can
compromise the goal of measles elimination in
Europe by 2010 set by the World Health
Organization Regional Office for Europe [12].

[An enviable European success story whereby
measles has been eradicated from Portugal and the
indigenous autochthonous population maintained
free of measles. In 2001/2002, the seropositivity
of the general Portuguese population against
measles was of 95.2 percent, with a vaccination
coverage of 95-98 percent and a seroconversion
efficacy of 90-95 percent. This high vaccination
coverage has since been maintained and the last 2
confirmed cases of indigenous measles in the
autochthonous Portuguese population occurred in
2002 and 2003, Subsequently a high level of
vigilance and diagnostic efficiency has enable
the Portuguese health authorities to identify 2
imported cases of measles and prevent virus
transmission to the indigenous population. - Mod.CP]
