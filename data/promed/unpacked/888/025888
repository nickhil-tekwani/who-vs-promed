African swine fever: all clear for suspected case in Potsdam (press release, 9 Jan 2021)

The suspicion of African swine fever (ASF) in a wild boar carcass found in Potsdam's Gross Glienicke was not confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory. The Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (Federal Research Institute for Animal Health, FLI) was able to rule out ASF through extensive, additional examinations of the sent wild boar carcass.

State Secretary for Consumers Anna Heyer-Stuffer, head of the ASF crisis team, said, "I am very happy and relieved about this result! I would like to thank the animal disease control service of the state of Brandenburg for their quick and professional action. I would also like to thank the city of Berlin, the state capital Potsdam, and the surrounding districts, who made all the necessary preparations within a very short time and thus showed that everyone is prepared for an emergency. Because one thing is clear: ASF can also be carried over long distances by humans. We must therefore continue to be very vigilant to prevent the virus from spreading from infected areas."

[Fortunately, the suspected significant spread of ASF virus westward to the vicinity of Berlin, as covered in 20210108.8085937, has not been confirmed. The virus is thus continuing its circulation in eastern Brandenburg and northeast Saxony, along the Polish border. The number of cases in the said 2 German states combined has reached, according to a media report dated 8 Jan 2021, a total of 480 (https://www.agriculture.com/markets/newswire/germany-finds-more-african-swine-fever-in-wild-boar-cases-reach-480).

The continuing ASF outbreak wild boar has halted German pork exports to Asia. - Mod.AS
