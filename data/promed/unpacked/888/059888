Biologists think there's a risk of another pneumonia outbreak developing among Jackson Hole's bighorn sheep herd.

The Jackson Hole Daily (http://bit.ly/VhI3Zj) reported Monday [28 Jan 2013] that 10 of 14 sheep darted earlier this month [January 2013] tested positive for a bacterium linked to bighorn die-offs in the West.

Biologists took samples from the animals because of a high death rate among radio-collared sheep. 6 of the 20 tracked sheep have died since the summer [2012].

The tests of the darted sheep did yield some good news. Game and Fish wildlife biologist Doug Brimeyer said none of the 14 had a more dangerous pathogen and all had good fat reserves.

The area's bighorn sheep herd was cut in half by a pneumonia outbreak in 2002 and the population took years to recover.

[As noted in the article there have been pneumonia outbreaks before. An oral vaccine or antibiotic that the sheep would eat would be helpful, but management of these wild animals is not always the easiest and their range is over very difficult terrain.

A quick review of the ProMED-mail archives will show that this has been an ongoing problem for several years. Almost always it is some variant of _Pasteurella_ pneumonia. Sadly, methods of dealing with the disease do not seem to have changed, and measures toward control of the disease, other than selective culls which does not work well, do not appear to have made any progress.
