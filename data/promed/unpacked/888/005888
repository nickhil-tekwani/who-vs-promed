Residents in Melbourne's northeast are being warned to be on high alert to flu-like symptoms after an outbreak of legionnaires' disease. 3 cases of the infection, which is acquired by breathing in water droplets containing bacteria [_Legionella pneumophila_], were detected in Bundoora in November [2012]. The Department of Health launched an investigation after it emerged all 3 people lived or worked in or around Bundoora.

Victoria's chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester said the 2 men and one woman, aged 38, 56, and 72, had been hospitalised and were recovering. She said the department was testing a cooling tower in the area, but the results would not be known for several days. The tower was shut down on Friday [30 Nov 2012] and disinfected yesterday [2 Dec 2012] as a precaution.

Legionnaires' disease causes flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever, chills, muscle aches and pains, followed by pneumonia and even death. "My message to people in the Bundoora area who may be suffering flu-like symptoms is to visit their GP who will assess the need for testing for legionnaires' disease," Dr Lester said.

In 2010, a man in his 60s died and 2 others were admitted to hospital after contracting the disease from cooling towers in Doncaster. There have been 55 cases of legionnaires' disease this year [2012] -- 7 less than the same period last year. A Health Department spokesman said there had been one death this year. Vulnerable residents include the elderly, heavy smokers, and drinkers.

[Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused usually by inhalation of aerosols containing _Legionella_ species. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of legionellosis; more than 70 percent of cases of legionnaires' disease are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8. Available at http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf). Legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ has been associated with the use of potting soil and gardening.

Legionnaires' disease attacks more frequently and is more severe in individuals who are elderly, are smokers or alcoholic, have an underlying illness, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or have a weakened immune system as a result of, for example, organ transplant or taking immunosuppressive drugs (such as, corticosteroid therapy) for other reasons. However, it is important to emphasize that relatively healthy individuals can also be at risk of contracting the disease.

The news report above does not say how the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was made, nor what the species of _Legionella_ was implicated in the 3 cases, but presumably it is _L. pneumophila_, a water-borne pathogen, since a cooling tower is being tested as a possible source.

A diagnosis of even a single case of legionnaires' disease implies the presence of an environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely to have been exposed. It is therefore a public health imperative to find that source to prevent further cases. The effect of wind speed and direction on _Legionella_-contaminated plumes from cooling towers may influence the distribution of cases.

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens would suggest transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/).

However, this is difficult in legionellosis outbreaks, because frequently the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is made only on the basis of urinary _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen testing or serology, rather than isolation of the organism from cultures of respiratory tract specimens. Consequently, clinical isolates are often not available for genotyping.

Bundoora is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 16 km (9.9 mi) north from Melbourne's Central Business District (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundoora,_Victoria). Victoria is the 2nd most populous and most densely populated state in Australia, with over 70 percent of its people living in Melbourne, the state capital and largest city (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia)).
