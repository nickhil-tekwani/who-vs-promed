Ross River Virus Warning - Northern Territory
---------------------------------------------
The Australian Centre for Disease Control has issued a warning about the
threat of the mosquito-borne Ross River virus in the Northern Territory.
The Centre stated that there have been 9 reported cases of [Ross River
virus-associated disease in Katherine in the past 2 weeks. The mosquitoes,
which carry the virus responsible for the debilitating disease [benign
polyarthritis, are [presentin high numbers in the Katherine, Barkly and
Gove regions as a consequence of flooding. The Centre's David Peacock has
advised residents to wear light-colored protective clothing, use an
appropriate personal repellent, and avoid outdoor exposure at dawn and dusk.
"We've had slightly more [cases of Ross River virus infection in Katherine
than usual," he said. "There have been 9 [cases in the last couple of
weeks in East Arnhem and Darwin. It is the time of year when case [numbers
are high and we need to remind people to try and avoid [exposure to
mosquitoes."
