Following further laboratory results, the Chief Veterinary Officer
has confirmed that the strain of H7 avian influenza present in laying
hens at the farm in Banbury is highly pathogenic.

Further laboratory tests are in progress to identify the N type and
possible relationships with previously identified viruses. A detailed
epidemiological investigation to better understand the origin and
development of the disease is also underway.

The 3-km inner and 10-km outer Temporary Control Zone was established
on 3 Jun 2008 with measures appropriate to a highly pathogenic
strain. These measures remain in place, and existing restrictions
continue to apply.

These restrictions include the housing or otherwise isolation from
contact with wild birds in the inner 3-km zone. All bird gatherings
in the Temporary Control Zone are banned. Other movements of birds
and some products are also banned in the whole of the Temporary
Control Zone. Defra is urgently considering whether any wider
measures may be needed.

The Health Protection Agency has confirmed that the risk to public
health remains low. The Food Standards Agency has also confirmed that
there are no safety implications for the human food chain.

Poultry keepers are urged to be extremely vigilant, practice the
highest levels of biosecurity and report any suspicions of disease to
their local Animal Health Office immediately.

Notes to editors:
AI viruses are categorized according to their ability to cause severe
disease (pathogenicity) in avian species as either highly pathogenic
avian influenza viruses (HPAI) or low pathogenic (LPAI).

The Chief Veterinary Officer has confirmed that the restrictions
established on 3 Jun 2008 to contain the outbreak of highly
pathogenic avian influenza at a farm in Banbury, Oxfordshire should
remain in place. Protection and Surveillance Zones now replace the
Temporary Control Zone. This follows urgent consideration of the
measures required to control the outbreak at this stage.

The Temporary Control Zone, established on 3 Jun 2008 with measures
appropriate to a highly pathogenic strain, has now been revoked and
replaced with Protection and Surveillance Zones. The 3-km inner zone
is now a Protection Zone, and the 10-km outer zone is now a
Surveillance Zone.

The restrictions that applied in the Temporary Control Zone remain in
place. These restrictions include the housing or otherwise isolation
from contact with wild birds in the Protection Zone. All bird
gatherings in the Protection and Surveillance Zones are banned. Other
movements of birds and some products are also banned in those zones.
Please see the Defra website for more detailed information on the
restrictions that apply.

The European Commission has been informed of this development.
