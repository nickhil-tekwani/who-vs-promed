Illinois: New West Nile Lab Results Push Case Total to 813 with 53 Fatalities
--------------------------------------------------
Laboratory results received recently from the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) have pushed the number of human West Nile
disease cases contracted in Illinois last year to more than 800, Dr. John
R. Lumpkin, state public health director, reported on Wed 8 Jan 2003.
Dr. Lumpkin said the 35 new cases identified by CDC include the death of a
91-year-old Macon County woman and the first case from Logan County. The
additional laboratory-positive cases raised to 813 the number of
Illinoisans with the mosquito-borne disease in 2002, including 53 who died.
More than of 3900 cases of West Nile disease and 247 deaths were counted in
the U.S. in 2002, with Illinois reporting the highest number of both cases
and deaths.
Blood and spinal specimens and, in the case of the fatality, a brain tissue
sample were submitted to CDC last year for more sophisticated testing after
initial tests for West Nile disease were inconclusive at the Department's
laboratory or private laboratories. Additional cases of the disease are
expected to be confirmed in the coming weeks as CDC completes a backlog of
samples from Illinois. Cold weather in late October ended the threat of
West Nile disease in Illinois last year. The latest onset of illness in the
state was mid-October 2002.
The cases announced today reported symptoms between 26 Jul and 6 Oct 2002.
They include 8 from Chicago, 17 from suburban Cook County, 2 from Madison
County and one each from Kane, LaSalle, Logan, Macon, Macoupin, Peoria, St.
Clair, and Will counties.
The Macon County woman who died from West Nile encephalitis became ill on
18 Sep 2002 and died on 24 Sep. The state's other 52 West Nile encephalitis
fatalities were from Chicago (14), suburban Cook County (18), DuPage County
(3), Fulton County (3), Sangamon County (3) and one each from Effingham,
Jackson, Jefferson, Kane, Kendall, Knox, Lake, Macon, Madison, Moultrie,
and White counties. With the addition of a case from Logan County -- a
32-year-old woman who became ill on 7 Sep 2002 -- 53 of the state's 102
counties have reported at least one case of West Nile disease.
A complete listing of the positive humans, birds, mosquito batches, and
horses identified so far this year in Illinois, by county, is available on
the Department's Web site at
