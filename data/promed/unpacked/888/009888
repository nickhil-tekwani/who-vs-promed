Foot and mouth disease hits northwest China
-------------------------------------------
An outbreak of foot and mouth disease [FMD] hit a major
livestock-producing prefecture in northwest China's Xinjiang region
this month [October 2004], but has been contained, local sources told
AFP.
China does not report outbreaks, and central government and
provincial officials refused to comment, but local government offices
and companies confirmed many cows and sheep were infected in the Yili
prefecture.
"In 3 counties in Yili, animals were discovered to have foot and
mouth disease," said an official from the livestock bureau of Yining
county, the worst-affected area. "They are giving vaccination shots
to animals in the area. The animals seriously ill will be dealt with
[killed? - Mod.AS] and buried."
Officials refused to say how many animals had been killed to prevent
the spread of the highly contagious disease which affects all species
of cloven-hoofed animals. But sources said the situation in Yili,
which exports meat around China, was "serious."
"Now in Yili, there's a very serious outbreak of foot and mouth
disease," said an executive surnamed Wang at veterinary medicine
supplier Xinjiang Huatian Shouyao Co. "Many cows and sheep have to
be burned or slaughtered."
An employee surnamed Hu at a feed company, the Yili Tiankang
Livestock Science and Technology Co. Ltd., said: "I heard many
animals were slaughtered. They're not purchasing as much feed. It's
had a great impact on us."
The spokesman for the Munich-based World Uighur Congress, an overseas
rights group for Uighur Muslims, who populate the Yili area, said he
heard more than 1000 cows and sheep died suddenly this month from the
disease.
Vehicles coming in and out of Yining were disinfected and neighboring
counties also had to vaccinate their animals and disinfect vehicles.
"We set up checkpoints on all roads leading to our county and shut
down all livestock trading markets," said Zhang Aidong, an official
of Nileke County.
A Yining county government official would only say: "It's been controlled."
China is a member of the World Organisation for Animal Health, whose
167 member countries are supposed to report animal diseases they
detect on their territory so other countries can take preventative
measures.
Yining county is the biggest livestock-producing county in Xinjiang,
according to its website.
The Yining livestock bureau official admitted: "It happens
frequently, but this year the symptoms are different."
Wang of the veterinary medicine company said: "The virus has mutated."

[Official information from the Chinese authorities, urgent
confirmation -- or otherwise -- of the said information on FMD, is
imperative. If the information is correct, details on the virus
strain involved and the control measures adopted should be included
in the notification.
China's last OIE-reported outbreak of FMD occurred in May 1999. It
was caused by FMD serotype O (most probably of the pan-Asian group).
In all, 8 outbreaks were officially reported: 5 outbreaks from Tibet,
2 from Hainan, and one from Fujian. The disease was reported as
absent during 2000-2002. In the 2003 annual report, FMD is not
mentioned at all.

During 2003, China's monthly reports covered only the period
September - December, and stated that the disease was absent. In
2004, monthly reports cover the period January - June, also stating
absence of the disease. No later reports are available.
ProMED-mail's request for information following published rumors
about the presence of FMD in Inner Mongolia (China) at the beginning
of 2004 has not received a response.
An OIE experts mission visited China during 10-19 May 2004. According
to the Mission's 20-page report (which was available on OIE's
web-site until very recently), 6 Reference Laboratories for the
following List A diseases were visited and reviewed: classical swine
fever (CSF), rinderpest, avian influenza (AI), contagious bovine
pleuropneumonia (CBPP), Newcastle disease (ND) and bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE). Hopefully, FMD will be covered in future
visits.- Mod.AS]
