Netherlands: Q fever in quarter of the goat farms
-------------------------------------------------
Currently 80 out of the 360 goat farms in the Netherlands appear infected
with Q fever. This was reported by the Animal Health Service in Deventer.
Confirmation of tests will take another 2 weeks. Measures will not be
applied until 4 weeks from now.

So far this year 4 goat farms in the Netherlands were officially declared
contaminated, based on a former detection method. A farm was considered
infected only if the percentage of abortions was larger than 5 per cent.
However, it appears that the agriculture ministry knew that another 41
farms had infected goats, based on milk sample tests. No measures were
applied to these farms. In sheep farms Q fever is rare. From 40 farms, only
one proved infected.

Q fever is a serious zoonosis, that causes not that severe problems in
goats, but has high morbidity in people with serious symptoms: fatigue,
high fever, serious headaches, severe pneumonia, sometimes resulting in
hospitalization and even death. The causal agent is _Coxiella burnetii_,
which spreads through air. The bacteria is particularly dangerous in case
of pregnancy or heart valve abnormalities.

In the Netherlands, the outbreak started in 2007 in Herpen, a village in
the south of the country, and since then the disease has spread every year.
6 people died. This year 2100 people were infected. It is the largest
outbreak of Q fever ever reported in the world.

Controlling the disease is difficult, because the bacteria does not
disappear from the soil. Until now, measures consisted of prohibition of
spreading out manure and moving animals from infected farms.

Results of vaccination are still being investigated by the Animal Health
Service. The vaccine seems to prevent abortion and animals produce
sufficient antibodies, but it is not clear yet whether excretion of
bacteria is prevented. Milk production may decrease by 8 to 10 percent in
the 1st weeks following vaccination.

The Dutch authorities commissioned the National Institute for Public Health
and the Environment (RIVM) to develop scenarios to fight Q fever,
considering also moving or closing down farms.

[According to data from RIVM (the National Dutch Institute for Public
Health and the Environment), as of 29 Oct 2009, 2236 cases of Q fever have
been suspected since 1 Jan 2009, 2126 of which have been
laboratory-confirmed and 110 regarded as "probable". 6 Q fever patients
died. The numbers for previous years were: 2007 -- 168, 2008 -- 1000. A
histogram presenting weekly figures for the period 1 Jan 2007 - 28 Oct 2009
is available at

A map, showing the distribution of the disease throughout the Netherlands
during 2009 (incidence per 100 000 inhabitants), is available at

The EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH),
Section : Animal Health & Animal Welfare, included the subject "Information
from the Netherlands on the Q fever situation" on its agenda for the
meeting of 3-4 Nov 2009. A protocol of the meeting, with the updated Q
