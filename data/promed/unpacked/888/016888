The Director of the Eva Peron Hospital, Dr. Enrique Medina, today [30 Apr 2015] confirmed on Radio 10 of Oran the 1st case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the area of operations no. 31.

According to this radio station, the victim is an adolescent who lives in 62 ha in Hipolito Yrigoyen city [Salta province], who had left an urban area. "We have not confirmed this is an urban case; we still do not know if it is a rural or interurban case," said the physician.

In December 2014, there were 4 cases of hantavirus [infections]. "Yrigoyen does not escape the geography [or ecology] of the northern province of Oran department, and this is worrisome. Hantavirus [infections] develop so rapidly that it gives medical teams little time to act," the physician stated.

[The number of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome cases in Salta province this year (2015) is not clear. A 7 Apr 2015 report (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150409.3287279) indicated that there were 19 cases in the area. An earlier post mentioned only 5 cases in the Oran area (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150408.3285307). The above report indicates that there were 4 cases in December 2014, but perhaps that relates to just Hipolito Yrigoyen city. As mentioned in the previous posts of cases in Salta province, the hantavirus involved in these cases is likely Oran hantavirus that occurs in northwestern Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_). Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in any of these cases.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_, is available at http://www.hantavirus.cl/educacion_prevencion/galeria_reservorio.htm.
