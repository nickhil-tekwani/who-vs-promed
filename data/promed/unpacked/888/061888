Included in the week 16 communicable disease threats report, issued by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) on 18 Apr [2014], are the 1st chikungunya [virus infection] case counts from the Dominican Republic [DR]. The DR has reported 17 confirmed and 767 suspected cases of the mosquito borne disease.

The number of confirmed and suspected cases for the entire Caribbean outbreak increased nearly 20 per cent in the week, to 29 760.

The French-speaking islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe continue to be the most seriously affected by chikungunya [virus infections]. Martinique is reporting 1473 confirmed cases and an astonishing 16 000 suspected cases, along with 2 deaths. Guadeloupe has seen 1261 confirmed and 4710 suspected chikungunya cases, with one death.

The French side of the island of St. Martin has reported 3 chikungunya deaths. There have been 793 confirmed cases and 2980 suspected cases.

Chikungunya was 1st detected in the Western Hemisphere on French St. Martin in early December 2013.

The spread of chikungunya on the South American mainland continues to be slow but steady. French Guyana reported 46 confirmed cases, an increase of 4 from last week. Unlike several of the French islands, Guyana is not reporting suspected cases to the ECDC.

The British and Dutch islands that have reported chikungunya cases reported no new cases this week. Based upon the reporting history since January [2014], it appears that these smaller governments are making less frequent reports to the ECDC. Timely testing is an issue for these islands, with patient specimens being sent to other islands such as Trinidad for processing.

The Dominican Republic began investigating an outbreak of illnesses with chikungunya symptoms in mid-March [2014]. On 4 Apr [2014], the Health Minister, Dr. Freddy Hidalgo Nunez, announced that testing done by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta had confirmed chikungunya [virus infections] were present. Today's [18 Apr 2014] data represents the 1st official case counts after that announcement.

Chikungunya is carried by the yellow fever mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_. The mosquito is common throughout tropical and sub-tropical North and South America. The University of Florida, in its presentation on _Ae. aegypti_, notes that the species has been found in at least 23 U.S. states.

The yellow fever mosquito is highly adapted to feeding off humans. It is an aggressive day biter, and will bite indoors as well as outdoors. The species breeds in containers with rainwater in them such as empty cans, gutters, unattended pet bowls and bird baths.

As of 11 Apr 2014, there have been more than 25 000 probable and confirmed cases in the region; 6 fatalities have been reported.

Update of the week [13-19 Apr 2014]
During the past week, new cases have been reported in most of the affected areas. In the French Antilles the number of new cases is generally decreasing or constant. In French Guiana, the number of autochthonous cases is increasing.

The Department of Health of the Dominican Republic has reported cases of chikungunya [virus infection] on the island affecting the province of San Cristobal, with 17 laboratory confirmed cases and 767 suspected cases.

The number of cases is also increasing in Dominica and Anguilla (WHO). To date, islands with confirmed cases are Saint Martin/Sint Maarten, Martinique, Saint Barthelemy, Guadeloupe, British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, Dominica, Aruba, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Dominican Republic and French Guiana in mainland South America. In most of the territories of the French Antilles, given the caseload, the health authorities decided not to seek laboratory confirmation for all suspected cases.

[Summary]
On 5 Dec 2013, the French National Reference Centre for arboviruses confirmed autochthonous chikungunya cases on Saint Martin Island, French West Indies. On 20 Dec [2013], about 50 confirmed cases were reported with additional evidence for autochthonous transmission on Martinique island. In January 2014, autochtonous cases have been reported also from Guadeloupe, Saint Barthelemy, Dominica, and the British Virgin Islands.

The full-length viral RNA genome was characterised directly from the serum of 2 viraemic patients using next-generation sequencing methods. The virus does not belong to the ECSA [East Central South African] genotype but to the Asian genotype, identified in late 1950s in southeast Asian countries. It is phylogenetically related to strains recently identified in Asia (in Indonesia in 2007, in China in 2012, and in the Philippines in 2013), most of them sharing a specific 4-amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene. The virus is only distantly related to the Asian genotype virus that recently circulated in New Caledonia, which harbours [a] different amino acid deletion in the NSP3 gene.

[This report is yet another example of chikungunya virus moving long distances, no doubt via a viremic individual who acquired the virus infection in Asia and transported it to the Caribbean, where there were abundant populations of mosquito vectors. It is not surprising that there has been virus movement over shorter distances in the Caribbean. - Mod.TY
