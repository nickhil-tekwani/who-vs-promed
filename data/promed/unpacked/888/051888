Bovine paralytic rabies confirmed in Misiones
---------------------------------------------
Rodolfo Jacquet, undersecretary for animal production of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Production, confirmed the occurrence of 5 cases of
paralytic rabies in the area of Montecarlo and Caraguatay, forcing the
postponement for 45 days of the 13th Provincial Calf Fair scheduled to take
place 26-28 Feb 2010, in Montecarlo.

Following confirmation of the 1st cases, the official acknowledged that the
number of infected animals might be higher. "So far we have detected cases;
but we also found shelters with more than 100 vampires (transmitter of the
virus), which indicates that the number of animals infected with the
disease and that are incubating it is greater. Surely more sick animals
will appear in the coming days," he said.

Paralytic rabies is a fatal disease caused by the same virus that causes
rabies in dogs and cats. It affects bovines but can also occur in other
species such as horses, sheep, pigs, and other warm-blooded animals. Being
a deadly disease, it must be prevented in the months before the summer.

Jacquet confirmed that one of the cases detected corresponds to a horse
from a herd in Caraguatay. He recommended that producers "vaccinate as soon
as possible" all the animals in the property to avoid the spread of the
virus. In that regard, he announced that the Ministry of Agriculture would
collaborate with the provision of the necessary dosages of vaccine and that
tomorrow [21 Feb 2010] he would be traveling to the critical zone to carry
out the sanitary action.

"The Ministry of Agriculture recommends that all producers vaccinate their
animals as soon as possible; we know that the vaccine is not effective
immediately but it takes about 15 to 20 days to produce the necessary
immunity to prevent death and surely during those 20 days some animals
already incubating the disease will die because there won't be time for the
vaccine to protect them; it is inevitable," he said.

On the other hand, he said, SENASA [National Food Safety and Quality
Service] decided "to ban all movement of livestock in the critical region
to avoid further risks, and added that he felt "great sorrow" over the
situation which developed because of the emergence of the virus. " We have
to postpone for 45 days the Montecarlo Calf Fair because we cannot take
chances by concentrating the animals. It is bad luck that the disease
appeared a week before the event. The suspension of 45 days will allow
healthy animals to develop the necessary immunity after vaccination, while
those who are sick will die.

Rabies is mainly transmitted through the bite of vampires and bats.
Prevention is important because once the animal gets sick there is no way
to avoid death.

[Vampire bats have frequently been known to transmit rabies and finding a
bat shelter with large number of bats, does not mean all the bats have
rabies and consequently a larger number of animals will be found ill.

Rabies is a method of controlling vampire bats, as it will cause them to
die. This method may not provide control in a timely fashion for the fair.
In addition, since most vampire bats feed at the same location, spearing
anticoagulant on the bovines in locations where the bats feed will provide
a dose of anticoagulant that will kill the bat in 3 or 4 days. While this
has been shown to be effective in Mexico, it may not be a timely control
for the fair. However if they are postponing the fair and vaccinating
animals, this may be an additional level of control worth considering.
Capturing some of the bats and spreading anticoagulant on the back of the
bats allows them to take it to their roost where they groom each other and
the anticoagulant reaches more of the colony. This has been shown to be
effective in Mexico, but is labor intensive and not without its own risk.

Postponing the livestock show may prevent some animals from coming into
contact with the local rabid vampire bats.

Vaccination of the animals is a good idea, prior to providing a buffet of
new blood for the rabid vampire bats. There seems to be no plan for
relocating the vampire bats or forcing their relocation away from the
livestock fair grounds. I am unsure of the range of rabid vampire bats so I
am not sure if this is a valid suggestion. Likewise, as bats tend to be
nocturnal and feed on the cattle at night, what about many large and
powerful lights on the cattle pens all night?

Vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_) are small (25-35 grams/0.8-1.2 oz),
winged mammals, with a wingspan of 25-35 cm (10-14 in) and a body about the
size of an adult's thumb. They use echolocation to find their prey. Having
once found their prey, they use sharp teeth to make an incision and lap the
blood as it flows from the wound. Vampire bats do not chew their food,
rather they lap it, and consequently have fewer teeth than other bats. As
noted in the article above, the vampire bat saliva is better at keeping
blood from clotting than any known medicine. Vampire bats may one day help
prevent heart attacks and strokes, according to many bat researchers.

Although there are 3 species of vampire bats (_Desmodus rotundus_, the
common vampire bat; _Diphylla ecaudata_, hairy-legged vampire bat; and
_Diaemus youngi_, the white-winged vampire bat), as far as I understand,
only the common vampire bat is significantly involved with bovine paralytic
rabies. This is supported by Brass (1994) who notes the following (p.
58-59): "although they may become infected with the rabies virus, _Diaemus_
and _Diphylla_ are generally not considered to be significant in the cycle
of rabies transmission to livestock or humans. Few investigations have been
made of these bats and little is known of their habits or biology"
(Greenhall, 1972a). _Desmodus_ is the most common of the vampires, has the
widest distribution, and is the most well known of the 3. _Diaemus_ is the
rarest and least studied. The relative abundance of _Desmodus_ may be
related to its more liberal tastes in animal blood and the wider range of
its host populations (Villa-Ramirez, 1969). Of the 3 species of vampire
bats, the common vampire bat, _Desmodus rotundus_, is implicated almost
exclusively in the transmission of paralytic rabies to livestock
(Greenhall, 1974).

A lack of a significant link between the other 2 species of vampires and
bovine paralytic rabies is somewhat to be expected. _Diphylla_ and
_Diaemus_ both apparently prefer avian blood rather than mammalian blood.
They are much less likely to use cattle as a host species. Indeed,
_Diphylla_ is thought to be close to an avian blood specialist. More
information can be found in Greenhall (1988).

Clinical signs of rabies in cattle may include evidence of neurological
disease, loss of coordination (specially in hind legs), excessive
salivation, anorexia, tenesmus, ataxia, drowsiness, dyspnea,
aggressiveness, and in some cases, diarrhea and pneumonia. Rabies is
preventable in cattle with a vaccine.

The paralytic form of rabies is first manifested by paralysis of the throat
and masseter muscles, often with profuse salivation and inability to
swallow. Dropping of the lower jaw is common in dogs. Owners frequently
examine the mouth of dogs and livestock searching for a foreign body or
administer medication with their bare hands, thereby exposing themselves to
rabies. These animals may not be vicious and rarely attempt to bite. The
paralysis progresses rapidly to all parts of the body, and coma and death
follow in a few hours. The latter is very much what seems to be happening
with the livestock described above.

Rabies is known to be transmitted by the 'bite' of the vampire bat because
the virus resides in the saliva. Rabies is identified through testing of
the brain of a deceased animal.

Rabies can pass from bovines to people, but the animal must bite the person
or the person must have contact with saliva of the animal and it must enter
the human body, through a cut, scratch, the mucus membranes of the eye, the
nose, or the mouth. So it is not casual contact that will infect the
person. The bovines usually have a distinctive bellow when they are
infected with rabies. Although this is not a diagnostic quality, it is
unusual enough that many veterinarians recognize it. Nevertheless
consumption of diseased animals is not recommended.
