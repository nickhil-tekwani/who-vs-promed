Taiwan reports cases of foot-and-mouth disease
----------------------------------------------
Taiwan said on Monday it discovered fresh cases of Foot and Mouth Disease
(FMD) among hogs, dealing a blow to the livestock sector still reeling
from a highly contagious epidemic in 1997.
The cabinet-level Council of Agriculture said in a statement the
government destroyed 3 hogs infected with the fatal disease. The council
said the source of the virus was hog farms in the central county of
Nantou and southern county of Kaohsiung.
An inspection of these farms showed no signs of further infections, it
added. Taiwan has pursued an intensive eradication campaign since FMD
devastated its hog population in 1997, but isolated cases had been reported
from time to time. Taiwan's agricultural
authority has ordered livestock farms to register by the end of June, 2000,
as part of efforts to contain any outbreak of the disease.
The 1997 outbreak had forced authorities to slaughter a quarter of
Taiwan's 14 million pigs and killed what had been a US$1.55
billion-a-year pork export industry.
Britain uncovered its first cases of FMD for 20 years last week and
prompted a handful of countries to ban or suspend imports of British
livestock to prevent the disease from further spreading.
FMD is characterised by the development of blisters in the mouth and feet
of hoofed animals such as cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. The disease can
be fatal in animals and causes lameness and loss of appetite.

[In the past, 1997 and 1999, the FMD type was serotype O, the same type
as Britain now has. I do not know what subtypes either of these outbreaks
are. However, earlier ProMED-mail posted a statement released in Britain
indicating this could be a pandemic version. - Mod.TG
