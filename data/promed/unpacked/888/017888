The hemorrhagic disease observed in Wyoming this year is due to bluetongue
virus, not epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHD-V), as mistakenly
reported in the news release. BTV-17 was isolated from the tissues of 3
pronghorn antelope sent to Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study
(SCWDS), in Athens, Georgia, last week.
