Anthrax fears in Gorumara
-------------------------
Anthrax fear has gripped the Gorumara Forest area, after the death of a gaur
[wild bovine, _Bos gaurus gaurus_] 2 days ago. Last Wed [14 Apr 2004], the
gaur was found dead in the Gorumara Forest area. It is suspected that it was
infected with the anthrax [bacterium]. In the preliminary examination by the
veterinary medical team, [lesions] of anthrax were found in the body. But,
in order to get a detailed report of what exactly happened, body parts have
been sent to Kolkata.
About a month ago, a rhinoceros had died in the same forest, also of
suspected anthrax. After this death, however, forest officials are now not
taking any chances.
After preliminary examinations, forest officials suspect that there is a
possibility of the anthrax [spores existing] in the grasses of the Gorumara
forest area.

[One must admit puzzlement -- in that the forest officials apparently did
not react to the prior rhinoceros death claimed also to be from anthrax.
Possibly it is only in retrospect that the true cause of the rhinoceros
death became apparent. In India rhinoceroses live at lower altitudes; North
Bengal abuts Sikkim and Bhutan along the latter's southern borders. Thus,
as locals the world over have a tendency to graze livestock within national
park boundaries, there may have been political as well as veterinary
pressure to vaccinate livestock in the neighbouring villages outside the
park.
All other wildlife outbreaks reported on ProMED have been in West Bengal or
to the south, very different environments. If any of our Indian members have
any further information on this outbreak, it would be appreciated if they
would share it. - Mod.MHJ]
