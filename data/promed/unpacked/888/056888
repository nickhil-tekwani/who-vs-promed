Thousands of avians to be killed in the south due to bird flu
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture is to cull today [9 Mar 2012] 11 000 turkeys in Moshav Shalva, south of Kiryat Gat, following the discovering of avian influenza H5N1.

The director of Veterinary Services in the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr Nadav Galon, has announced quarantine measures in the affected village and animal movement restrictions within a 10 km [6 mi] zone around it. Teams of the Ministry's Plant and Animal Control Unit (PACU) have marked the area around the outbreak and are going to cull the birds today.

Neighbouring holdings are to be sampled for laboratory tests, to exclude additional foci. There are no reports on similar disease in any other settlement within 10 km around Shalva.

This is the 1st HPAI case in Israel since March 2011, when it was diagnosed in Kibbutz Rosh Zturim; in May 2010, cases [2 emus] were diagnosed in a small petting farm in Kibbutz Ein Gedi, 4 months after an outbreak in Kibbutz Ein-Shemer, near Hadera.

The Ministry of Agriculture said that temperatures above 70 deg C [160 deg F] kill all influenza viruses; there is no reason to avoid eating well-cooked chicken and well-boiled eggs. Prescribed elementary hygienic requirements in kitchens should be adhered to, such as hand washing and cleaning of utensils and working surfaces.

[During the morning of Fri 9 Mar 2012, Israeli Radio reported a 2nd HPAI H5N1 outbreak, namely in Kibbutz Holit, involving, similarly to Shalva, a large commercial turkey enterprise. This information has been directly confirmed with the Ministry. Reportedly, both outbreaks have already been notified to the OIE. Indeed, OIE has already disseminated a notification, including a map, available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=11725.

Holit, situated 2.3 km (about 1.5 mi) from the Gaza strip and 5.9 km (about 4 mi) from Sinai (Egypt), had already been found infected once in the past, namely in 2006 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20060320.0858).

Israel's previous experience with H5N1 outbreaks and their immediate notification and eradication are documented in the "see also" items listed below. HPAI H5N1 is endemic (including human cases) in Egypt, Israel's south west neighbour.

The OIE notification includes the following epidemiological comments: "The epidemiological investigation is ongoing. Almost all the cases of H5N1 that have ever been in Israel occurred in March." If the outbreaks are indeed that seasonal, a possible explanation deserves to be sought in bird migration (as, apparently, suggested in the past).

For the location of Shalva (spelled "Shalwa" in OIE's notification) see map at http://healthmap.org/r/1Yir and for Holit, http://healthmap.org/r/1Yis. Both places are located within "Hadarom" (Hebrew for "south") region. - Mod.AS]
