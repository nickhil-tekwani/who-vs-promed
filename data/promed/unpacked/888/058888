Rift Valley fever in Mauritania
-------------------------------------
An outbreak of Rift Valley fever has occurred in the Aioun area, in
south-eastern Mauritania. There have been 300-400 human cases (febrile
disease), including 6 deaths between 15 and 30 September (some with
haemorrhage and icterus). The latter were aged between 14 and 40 years, and
all were from areas where goats, sheep, cattle and camels are raised.
In the Assaba area, 2 patients were admitted to hospital; both died. The
epidemic peaked in late September/early October, and the most recent case
was reported around 25 October. Rift Valley fever virus has been isolated
from 2 samples (1 postmortem) at the Pasteur Institute in Dakar (Senegal).
Livestock were also severely affected (with up to 100% abortion rates for
some species), which will have serious economic consequences for the
population. The Ministry of Health has issued recommendations, and is
carrying out investigations with the support of WHO and FAO.

By the beginning of October 1998, Rift Valley Fever (RVF) virus was isolated
by the Institut Pasteur laboratory in Dakar, on 2 blood samples collected in
the Regional Hospital of Aioun, Hodh El Gharbi, Republic of Mauritania.
On October 19, an investigation team was sent to the area to
determine if these cases were isolated or part of an outbreak. Any
case of fever with no sign of localisation, hemorrhage or jaundice
occurring between 1 Sep 1998 and the date of investigation was a
<>; it was a <> when fever was associated
with hemorrhage or jaundice; the 2 cases positive for RVF were
considered as <>.
Aioun is located in a desert area (between <> 100mm and
200mm) [of rainfall per year - Mod.JW. However, in September, rains
were exceptionally heavy in the region, and the mosquito density
was much higher than usual.
According to the data collected in Aioun Hospital, the number of patients
admitted for fever in September and October 1998 (123) was 3 times larger
than last year at the same period. The number of cases increased from the
beginning of September until the second week of October, and then decreased.
Case fatality ratio was 9.8%. All ages were represented and the proportion
of under-5 year old children was 8.9% (16% of under-5 children are in the
general population). The sex-ratio M:F was 0.8. Only 7.3% of patients were
probable cases but symptoms were irregularly registered. One of the
confirmed cases had no hemorragic signs. Analysis of data collected in the
other health facilities of the Region is in process.
Concurrently with the increase of fevers in the human population, high rates
of animal abortion, mainly amongst sheep and goats, were reported by farmers.
In addition to the 195 blood samples collected from animals by a previous
mission, a total of 51 blood samples were collected from patients and
their families and from animals that aborted.
