Taiwan confirms first-ever _E. coli_ O157 case
----------------------------------------------
Taiwan on Thursday reported its first-ever confirmed case of an infection
with the virulent O157 strain of _E. coli_ that claimed the lives of
several children in western Japan during a 1996 epidemic. Department of
Health officials said a 6-year-old Chinese-American boy hospitalized Sunday
with bloody diarrhea was found to have contracted _E. coli_ O157, a
foodborne disease. The boy subsequently suffered complications linked to
the infection called hemolytic uremic syndrome, in which red blood cells
are destroyed and the kidneys fail. After 3 days of dialysis the boy's
condition has somewhat improved, but doctors said it was still too early to
predict whether he would recover.
The potentially fatal syndrome occurs in 2-7 percent of _E. coli_ O157
infections and mostly affects children under 5 and the elderly. The boy is
visiting from the United States during the summer vacation. But the
officials said it appears certain that he contracted the disease while in
Taiwan, since the condition developed more than 6 weeks after his arrival.
Previously, there have been a total of 19 suspected cases of _E. coli_ O157
infections, but none was confirmed, they said. Health authorities were
still trying to find out how the boy got infected with the bacteria.
Highly contagious O157 _E. coli_ is contracted mainly from under cooked
meat, but unpasteurized milk and raw vegetable sprouts such as alfalfa have
also been confirmed as potential sources. The bacteria can also be spread
through person-to-person contact, in particular in day-care centers,
kindergartens and homes for the elderly.
Some 100 cases of _E. coli_ O157 are reported in Japan every year, while
the U.S., where beef hamburgers are a staple, typically registers 10 000 to
20 000 cases a year.
But in 1996, Japan saw some 8700 people fall ill with the disease within 2
months following an _E. coli_ O157 outbreak in Okayama Prefecture, western
Japan. 7 people died in that epidemic.

[Actually, the US Center for Disease Control estimates that 73 000 cases
and 61 deaths occur in the USA annually. Lin et al. (J Microbiol Immunol
Infect 2001 Mar;34(1):17-24) have shown a prevalence of _E. coli_ O157:H7
of 0.13 percent in fresh bovine fecal samples, and of 2.6 percent in dairy
cattle in Taiwan. In a survey of specimens from 1280 patients presenting
with acute diarrhea from 1994-1996, Lee et al. failed to isolate any _E.
coli_ O157:H7 (J Microbiol Immunol Infect 1997 Feb;30(1):55-59). There are
no cases listed for Taiwan on the GIDEON database. This may be the first
recorded case for Taiwan as indicated in the article above. - Mod.ES]
