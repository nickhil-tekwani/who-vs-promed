"133 Children Contract Tuberculosis in Southern Kazakhastan" Itar Wire
Service (02/05/98)
Kazakhastan health officials report that 133 children in the city of
Zhanatas contracted tuberculosis during a routine fall vaccination last
year. Although the children contracted TB as early as last September, local
authorities reportedly concealed the incident from national officials as
they tried to cure the children on their own. According to Albert Askarov,
deputy chief of Kazakhastan's sanitary and epidemiological surveillance
service, their inability to do so forced them to report the incident
several days ago. Askarov said the children were infected because untrained
medics accidentally used the wrong, more concentrated, formulation of the
vaccine for injections. National and regional health officials are now
investigating the situation.
