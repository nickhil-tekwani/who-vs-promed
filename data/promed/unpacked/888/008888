The outbreak of acute Chagas disease [trypanosomiasis - Mod.MPP] that
occurred in Andres Bello Municipal School in Chacao [metropolitan
Caracas] may be restricted to this school. However, as a preventive
measure, the Ministry of Health declared a national sanitary alert
for Chagas disease, reported Dr. Luis Montiel, Epidemiology Director
of the Ministry of Health. This means 2 things: that persons with
fever for more than 5 days accompanied by symptoms such as muscle
pain, joint pain, facial edema, swollen lymph nodes, and arm or leg
inflammation must go to the nearest health facility so that
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ infection can be ruled out in patients presenting
with the these symptoms.
Overall, 956 persons (children and adults) in Andres Bello community
may have acquired the parasite. 937 persons have been studied up to
date, and 99 had the infection confirmed (most of them are children),
said Dr. Jesus Mantilla, Ministry of Health. It was not possible to
localize the 19 remaining subjects because they did not give their
address or a correct telephone number, said Dr. Montiel, so they are
requested to come to Caracas University Hospital or to Chacao Health Center.
There are 12 patients hospitalized with Chagas disease, 11 are in
Caracas University Hospital, and one is in a private clinic, said
Ministry of Health spokesmen. Additionally, 76 of the 98 persons who
were reported as positive for Chagas disease are currently receiving
therapy, said Dr. Mantilla. The drug (which is given to the patients
without any charge) must be taken for 90 days, and follow-up should
continue for up to 2 years; the drug "reduces the risk for developing
chronic Chagas disease to a minimum," said Dr. Montiel.
Certain kinds of fruit juice were the likely vehicle through which
the parasite disseminated so quickly, affecting so many people. This
is what the Ministry of Health representatives and the scientific
team that is currently investigating this outbreak believe (this team
is led by Dr. Belkis Yole and Dr. Oscar Noya, from the Universidad
Central de Venezuela Institute of Tropical Medicine).
It is important to mention that the oral transmission route for
Chagas disease is very uncommon (transmission most commonly occurs
through contamination with Triatomine stools after the insect bites a
human being or an animal for its blood meal); however, in this case,
it is suspected that the fruit juice might have been contaminated
with Triatomine bugs or with their stools.
Health authorities ruled out the presence of the vector in the
households of Andres Bello School students as well as within the
school building, Dr. Mantilla pointed out. However, visits to the
household where fresh fruit juice is fixed everyday (which is located
outside Chacao Municipality) revealed a different story: There are
many Triatomine bugs in its surroundings (as well as plenty of
vegetation and a stream), said Dr. Montiel. Health personnel is
currently investigating whether these insects are infected with
_Trypanosoma cruzi_.

[This outbreak is an extremely serious occurrence from the
epidemiological point of view, because of its magnitude and its
potential consequences from a public health perspective. It is also a
new scenario, since affected persons belong to an educational
community including children and teenagers in a location where
natural transmission of the infection has never been reported.
This is the most extensive outbreak of Chagas disease transmission
through the oral route ever reported. Available information points
out that this outbreak is caused by food contamination. Once the
event was recognized and its origin was determined, a
multidisciplinary team was established, including officers from the
Municipal Institute for Health Cooperation and Care (IMCAS, according
to its Spanish initials) from Chacao Municipality, a group of
researchers from the Universidad Central de Venezuela Tropical
Medicine Institute, and regional and national epidemiology officers
from the Ministry of Health. This team aims to provide effective
solutions for controlling this outbreak and adequate management of
both clinical and therapy aspects in infected individuals.
In the 5-day period after the outbreak was identified, from a total
number including 814 students and 120 school workers, 95 percent of
these persons had samples collected and processed looking for a
diagnosis, even though it is a period of school holiday. Nearly 80
persons are currently receiving anti-parasitic therapy, since acute
infection was diagnosed in them. 15 of these persons are still
hospitalized. A 10-year-old boy died as a consequence of this
infection before its etiology was identified. A thorough
epidemiological investigation is currently underway in order to
determine the exact mechanism for this infection, and every measure
for adequate diagnosis and therapy has been taken. - Mod.JRT]

Oral transmission of _Trypanosoma cruzi_ causing Chagas disease was
highlighted in an outbreak at Santa Catarina, Brazil in 2005. This
outbreak was found to be caused by sugar cane juice contaminated with
_T. cruzi_-infected triatomid bugs and was extensively reported upon
by ProMED (see below).
At the same time, a similar outbreak was reported from Amapa, Brazil,
where 26 people were infected, and there was yet another report in
2006 from Para State.
In August 2007, 15 outbreaks of Chagas disease were recorded in the
northern Brazilian states of Para, Amazonas, and Amapa that had
occurred over the previous 15 months (see ProMED reports from 21 Aug
2007), and most of these outbreaks are believed to be food borne.
The present report emphasizes that food borne Chagas disease is a
public health concern in all areas where there is a reservoir of
_Trypanosoma cruzi_ in wild animals and where infected triatomid bugs
are in contact with food items. Fruit left exposed to triatomid bugs
seems to be a particular concern, whether entire bugs are squashed in
the process of pressing fruit juice or fruit is contaminated by feces
from the triatomid bugs, which then contaminate the fruit juice. - Mod.EP]
