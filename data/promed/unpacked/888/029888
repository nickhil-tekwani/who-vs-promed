New bovine TB cases confirmed in Manitoba
-----------------------------------------
About 230 cattle will have to be slaughtered at 2 farms in Manitoba after
confirmation last week that 3 cows were infected with bovine tuberculosis
(TB). The farms are in the Rural Municipality of Grandview, which is in the
disease eradication zone established by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(CFIA) around Riding Mountain National Park.
"It was not entirely unexpected, although it's certainly not happy news to
report this at all," said Maria Koller of the agency. "On the other hand,
it at least gives us the opportunity to deal with the infection before it
spreads further." The 3 infected cows all originated on one farm. Two are
still on that farm, while the third was sold to another farm in the same
area last summer.
The herd of origin is considered infected, which means the 90 cows and
calves on that farm will be slaughtered. The herd at the farm with the
other infected cow is considered exposed at this time, but not infected
with the disease. However, because as many as 140 cattle on that farm could
have been exposed to the infected animal, they will have to be destroyed
and tested for the disease.
"If we find any (TB) infection in those animals, then we have another
infected farm on our hands," Koller said. There are at least another 100
cattle at the second farm that are thought to have had no exposure to the
infected cow. Their fate hinges on the outcome of tests on the other 140
cattle. Testing will begin in February, said Koller, and will take a few
weeks to complete.
Both farms have been under quarantine since November 2002, when suspicions
surfaced that there might be infected cattle there. The discovery of more
infected cattle wasn't a surprise to producers, but it adds anxiety, said
Manitoba Cattle Producers Association president Betty Green. "It heightens,
in their minds, the need to address the source of the problem," Green said.
A small percentage of wild elk in the park area are known to be infected
with the disease, particularly toward the western side. The cattle
association earlier [in January 2003] passed a motion at its annual meeting
calling for a science-based cull of the wild elk in areas of the park where
the disease is known to exist. "Producers are willing to do their part,"
Green said. "The focus really is turning to Parks (Canada) and Manitoba
Conservation and how are they going to get this problem solved?"
The CFIA established a disease eradication area around Riding Mountain
National Park at the start of this year. The agency has been testing all
cattle herds in that area for signs of bovine TB. As of 22 Jan 2003, about
85 per cent of the herds had been tested.
The discovery of more infected cattle means at least another 3 years before
the area around the park can be considered free of the disease. TB-free
status would mean the removal of testing and movement restrictions on
cattle there. Currently, all breeding cattle and sexually intact heifers
destined for the United States from Manitoba must undergo TB testing. The
US Department of Agriculture (USDA) will be invited by the CFIA to review
the Riding Mountain disease eradication area later this year. Following
that review, the USDA may decide to lift the testing requirements on cattle
herds outside the eradication area, although that's not guaranteed.

[Cattle tuberculosis (TB), a disease caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_, can
produce internal lesions in animals. Cattle TB can be spread within a herd
when an infected animal coughs, releasing bacteria-laden mucus onto feed
that is consumed, or into the air that is inhaled by nearby cows. - Mod.TG]
