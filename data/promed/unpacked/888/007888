An outbreak of a potentially deadly virus affecting cats has been detected in Mattapan, according to the Animal Rescue League of Boston [Massachusetts].

"The Animal Rescue League of Boston became aware of this outbreak after responding to reports of sick cats in the area around Walk Hill Street in Mattapan," the agency said in a statement released this afternoon [19 Oct 2016]. "In conducting a full investigation of the sick animals it was determined that they had contracted this potentially fatal virus."

Panleukopenia -- also called feline distemper -- affects cats only. There is a vaccine that is "highly effective" in preventing transmission.

The Animal Rescue League of Boston in collaboration with the Massachusetts Animal Fund and City of Boston Animal Care & Control will conduct a free feline distemper vaccine clinic in Mattapan on Sat 22 Oct 2016 to assist the residents in this neighborhood with protecting their cats through vaccination.

The vaccinations will take place at the corner of Walk Hill Street and Harvard Street from 9:30 am to 12:30 pm. Cats must be in carriers If you do not have a carrier, please come by the clinic to pick one up and then return home for your cat.

[Most of the time, we expect these outbreaks in shelters or in hoarding situations. This sounds more like it is a neighborhood area. We applaud the efforts to get animals vaccinated.

Feline panleukopenia is a highly contagious, often fatal, viral disease of cats that is seen worldwide. Kittens are affected most severely. The causative parvovirus [FPV] is very resistant; it can persist for 1 year at room temperature in the environment, if protected in organic material. Feline panleukopenia is now diagnosed infrequently by veterinarians, presumably as a consequence of widespread vaccine use. However, infection rates remain high in some unvaccinated cat populations, and the disease occasionally is seen in vaccinated, pedigreed kittens that have been exposed to a high virus challenge.

Virus particles are abundant in all secretions and excretions during the acute phase of illness and can be shed in the feces of survivors for as long as 6 weeks after recovery. Being highly resistant to inactivation, parvoviruses can be transported long distances via fomites (such as shoes and clothing). However, FPV can be destroyed by exposure to a 1:32 dilution of household bleach (6 percent aqueous sodium hypochlorite), 4 percent formaldehyde, and 1 percent glutaraldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Peroxygen disinfectants are also highly effective.

Cats are infected oro-nasally by exposure to infected animals, their feces, secretions, or contaminated fomites. Most free-roaming cats are thought to be exposed to the virus during their 1st year of life. Those that develop subclinical infection or survive acute illness mount a robust, long-lasting, protective immune response.

FPV infects and destroys actively dividing cells in bone marrow, lymphoid tissues, intestinal epithelium, and -- in very young animals --cerebellum and retina. In pregnant queens, the virus may spread transplacentally (across the placenta) to cause embryonic resorption, fetal mummification, abortion, or stillbirth. Alternatively, infection of kittens in the perinatal period may destroy the germinal epithelium of the cerebellum, leading to cerebellar hypoplasia (disorder found in cats and dogs in which the cerebellum is not completely mature at birth), incoordination, and tremor. FPV-induced cerebellar ataxia has become a relatively rare diagnosis, because most queens passively transfer sufficient antibodies to their kittens to protect them during the period of susceptibility.

Most infections are subclinical, as evidenced by the high seroprevalence of anti-FPV antibodies among unvaccinated, healthy cats. Those cats that become ill are usually less than 1 year old. Peracute cases may die suddenly with little or no warning (fading kittens). Acute cases show fever (104-107 deg F [40-41.7 deg C]), depression, and anorexia after an incubation period of 2-7 days. Vomiting usually develops 1-2 days after the onset of fever; it is typically bilious and unrelated to eating. Diarrhea may begin a little later but is not always present. Extreme dehydration develops rapidly. Affected cats may sit for hours at their water bowl, although they may not drink much. Terminal cases are hypothermic and may develop septic shock and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Physical examination typically reveals profound depression, dehydration, and sometimes abdominal pain. Abdominal palpation --which can induce immediate vomiting -- may reveal thickened intestinal loops and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes. In cases of cerebellar hypoplasia, ataxia and tremors with normal mentation are seen. Retinal lesions, if present, appear as discrete gray foci.

The duration of this self-limiting illness is seldom greater than 5-7 days. Mortality is highest in young kittens less than 5 months old.

A presumptive diagnosis is usually based on compatible clinical signs in an inadequately vaccinated cat and the presence of leucopenia (low white cell count). Neutropenia (low neutrophil count) is a more consistent finding than lymphopenia. Total WBC (white blood cell) counts less than 2000 cells/microliter are associated with a poorer prognosis. During recovery from infection, there is typically a rebound neutrophilia with a marked left shift. Diagnosis can sometimes be confirmed using an in-office immunochromatographic test kit intended for detection of fecal CPV [canine parvovirus] antigen. However, fecal antigen is detectable only for a short time after infection. False-negative results are common.

Successful treatment of acute cases requires vigorous fluid therapy and supportive nursing care in the isolation unit. Electrolyte disturbances (such as hypokalemia), hypoglycemia, hypoproteinemia, anemia, and opportunistic secondary infections often develop in severely affected cats. Anticipation of these possibilities, close monitoring, and prompt intervention are likely to improve outcome. IV fluid replacement and maintenance with a balanced isotonic crystalloid solution (such as lactated Ringer's solution with calculated potassium supplementation) is the foundation of therapy. B vitamins should be added to the infusion, together with 5 percent glucose if hypoglycemia is suspected or proved. In addition to crystalloid infusion, transfusion of fresh-frozen plasma helps support plasma oncotic pressure and provides clotting factors to severely ill, hypoproteinemic kittens. Whole blood is preferable for the occasional cat that is severely anemic. Parenteral, broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is indicated; however, nephrotoxic drugs (such as gentamicin, amikacin) should be avoided until dehydration has been corrected. Antiemetic therapy (such as metoclopramide, ondansetron, maropitant) may provide some relief and allow earlier enteral feeding of soft, easily digested food. Parenteral nutrition is indicated for severely affected cases. Recombinant feline interferon omega (rFeIFN; 1 MU/kg/day SC for 3 days) should be considered for use in the treatment of feline panleukopenia. Although rFeIFN is not approved by the FDA for this purpose, it is approved and effective in the treatment of canine parvoviral enteritis.

Excellent inactivated and modified live virus vaccines that provide solid, long-lasting immunity are available for prevention of feline panleukopenia. Live vaccines should not be given to cats that are pregnant, immunosuppressed, or sick, or to kittens less than 4 weeks old. Most authorities recommend that kittens receive 2 or 3 modified live vaccine doses subcutaneously, 3-4 weeks apart. The 1st vaccination is usually given at 6-9 weeks of age. The last dose of the initial vaccination series should not be administered before the kitten is 16 weeks old, to ensure that interfering maternal antibodies do not inactivate the modified live virus. Exposure to virus should be avoided until 1 week after the initial vaccination series has been completed. Cats should be revaccinated 1 year later, and triennially or less frequently thereafter, although some manufacturers continue to recommend annual revaccination.
