Ontario: Death of Suspected Transfusion-related West Nile Virus Case
--------------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests have confirmed that a southern Ontario woman was infected
with West Nile virus, likely contracted from a blood transfusion during
cancer treatments, when she died last week. The 47-year-old woman, a
resident of Kitchener, died on 21 Nov 2002 in a Toronto hospital. The test
results were released yesterday by the National Microbiology Lab in
Winnipeg, said the Waterloo Regional Health Unit.
"The source of this infection is most likely a blood transfusion, and an
investigation by Canadian Blood Services continues at this time," Dr. Liana
Nolan said in a release. Earlier this week, the blood agency said Canada's
blood supply should be considered safe. West Nile virus has a short life
span of no more than a week in the blood of potential donors, said agency
CEO Dr. Graham Sher. Many of the different blood products from summer
donations are no longer in circulation, he added.
If it is confirmed that the woman contracted the mosquito-borne illness
through a transfusion, it would be the first such case in Canada, say
officials. After the woman's death, Nolan said her numerous transfusions
were "very likely to be the source" of the infection that gave her
encephalitis, a potentially deadly brain swelling triggered in rare cases by
West Nile virus infection. Nolan said the usual source of infection, a
mosquito bite, appeared unlikely in the woman's case because she was ill and
not outside during the mosquito season.
About 30 blood donors were being asked to be tested for West Nile virus, all
of them from southwestern Ontario. No screening test for donors currently
exists, but, overall, the risk of contracting the infection from blood
products is low. The woman had received both blood and platelets during 9
months of treatment at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto for large cell
lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system. Declared cancer-free, she
returned home on 4 Sep 2002 after a stem cell transplant. But she started
getting severe headaches and gastrointestinal upset within 5 or 6 days and
was taken to Cambridge Memorial Hospital with a high fever on 16 Sep 2002,
where she was diagnosed with viral encephalitis.
Canada has had 2 confirmed deaths related to West Nile virus infection this
year. A 70-year-old man from Mississauga, Ontario, succumbed to the disease
in September 2002 and an 83-year-old Montreal man died of pneumonia at the
end of September 2002, say Health Canada officials. In 1999, a 75-year-old
man from Toronto died after being infected while visiting the United States.
