Cattle, which were culled from a 2nd farm in Egham, Surrey, have
tested positive for foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], the government's
chief vet has said.
A "precautionary" cull of animals had already taken place at Stroude
Farm. It is close to the scene of Wednesday's [12 Sep 2007] outbreak,
and is located 10 miles (16 km) from the Pirbright research complex.
The [Pirbright] site was blamed as the source for the FMD outbreaks
at 2 farms last month [August 2007].
Debbie Reynolds, the government's chief vet, confirmed that FMD was
present at the farm. She added there had now been 4 infected farms
since the initial outbreak of the disease last month [August 2007].
Ms Reynolds said she was glad that all the animals on the farm had
been culled before the results were announced.
She also said the government was considering whether to allow animals
in England to be moved to slaughter.

Laboratory tests have today [14 Sep 2007] confirmed the presence of
FMD in the cattle herd at the slaughter on suspicion premises, where
culling was completed yesterday [13 Sep 2007].
The farm is within the existing Protection Zone and adjacent to the
Infected Premises confirmed on Tuesday [11 Sep 2007].
Minor changes have now been made to the Protection Zones and
Surveillance Zone in the area.
The new zones can be found on the FMD website, at

[In this case, the justification of UK's government's policy of
"precautionary" culling of contact or suspected animals was clearly
demonstrated. It will be interesting to obtain data on the species of
the animals found infected; reportedly, this unit included cattle and
pigs. Such information may have impact on the continued actions and policy.
DEFRA may soon be obliged to decide whether vaccination, probably
around the disease foci, deserves consideration. During the initial
phase of the FMD outbreak in Surrey, on 7 Aug 2007, the government
said "no decision has been taken on whether to vaccinate livestock,
but 300 000 doses have been ordered from Merial -- to ensure it is
ready if needed" (see ProMED-mail posting 20070807.2572). If the
assembly of said batch was timely completed, vaccination may start
immediately if the authorities decide to vaccinate.- Mod.AS]
