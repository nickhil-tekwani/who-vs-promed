9th New Human Case of Avian Influenza H5N1 in Cambodia in 2014
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia wishes to advise members of the public that one new human case of avian influenza has been confirmed for the H5N1 virus. This is the 9th case this year [2014] and the 56th person to become infected with the H5N1 virus in Cambodia. The case is from Kampot province. Of the 56 confirmed cases, 44 were children under 14, and 30 of the 56 were female. In addition, since the 1st case happened in Cambodia in 2005, only 19 cases have survived.

A 2-year-old girl from Kandal village, Vat Ang Khang Tboung commune, Banteay Meas district, Kampot province, was tested positive by Institut Pasteur du Cambodge on [14 Mar 2014]. The girl had onset symptom of fever on [8 Mar 2014]. Her parents sought treatment at a private practitioner on the same day [8 Mar 2014] and on the next day [9 Mar 2014]. The girl was admitted to a private clinic on [10 Mar 2014] and in Kantha Bopha Hospital on [13 Mar 2014]. She had symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnea, and Tamiflu was administrated on the same day [13 Mar 2014]. The girl died on [14 Mar 2014].

In the beginning of February [2014], chickens started dying in the village and in the house of the case. At the end of February [2014] and beginning of March [2014], it is estimated that 90 percent of poultries of the village died. The girl had direct contact with dead chickens while her relatives prepared them for food and the girl ate them.

The national and local Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) are conducting outbreak investigation and responses following the national protocol.

"Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serous threat to the health of all Cambodians and more so for children, who seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk. There have been 56 cases of H5N1 infection in humans since 2005 and here is the 9th case of this year [2014]. Children often care for domestic poultry by feeding them, cleaning pens and gathering eggs. Children may also have closer contact with poultry as they often treat them as pets and also seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk because they like to play where poultry are found. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent them from playing with chickens and ducks. Parents and guardians must also make sure children thoroughly wash their hands with soap and water before eating and after any contact with poultry. Hands may carry the virus that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Soap washes away the virus on hands. If children have fast or difficult breathing, their parents should seek medical attention at the nearest health facility and attending physicians must be made aware of any exposure to sick or dead poultry," said H.E. Dr. Mam Bunheng, Minister of Health.

A nationwide public health education campaign using radio has been launched at the end of January [2014], with prevention messages. Also, public health education campaign is being conducted in Kandal village, Kampot province using information, education and communications materials to inform families on how to protect themselves from contracting avian influenza. The government's message is: wash hands often with soap and water before eating and after coming into contact with poultry; keep children away from poultry; keep poultry away from living areas; do not eat dead or sick poultry; and all poultry eaten should be well cooked.

H5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans. Human H5N1 avian influenza is a very serious disease that requires hospitalization. Although the virus currently does not easily spread among humans, if the virus changes it could easily be spread like seasonal influenza. Hence, early recognition of cases is important.

The Ministry of Health will continue to keep the public informed of developments via the MoH website (http://www.cdcmoh.gov.kh), where relevant health education materials can also be downloaded.

For more information on human influenza please call the MoH Influenza Hotline numbers: 115 (free call); 012 488 981 or 089 669 567.

A 2-year-old girl from southwestern Kampot province died of H5N1 human avian influenza on Friday [14 Mar 2014], bringing the number of cases to 9 so far this year, said a joint statement from the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Cambodian Health Ministry on Monday [17 Mar 2014].

"The girl died on [14 Mar 2014] -- a day after being admitted to the Kantha Bopha Children Hospital," the statement said, adding that the toddler had symptoms of fever, cough and dyspnea.

The statement said that last month [February 2014], about 90 percent of chickens in her village died, and the girl had direct contact with dead chickens while her relatives prepared them for food and the girl ate them.

Bird flu remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians and children seem to be most vulnerable and are at high risk, Health Minister Mam Bunheng said.

"I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and make sure children wash their hands with soap and water after any contact with poultry," he said.

H5N1 influenza is a flu that normally spreads between sick poultry, but it can sometimes spread from poultry to humans, according to the WHO.

The virus was 1st identified in Cambodia 10 years ago. To date, the country has reported 56 human cases of the virus, killing 37 people, the statement said.
