100 pigeons die from Newcastle disease in Kaluga region
-----------------------------------------------
100 pigeons died within one hour in 2 suburban settlements near Kaluga.
For humans, Newcastle disease is harmless, but both wild birds and poultry
-- chickens, pheasants, turkeys -- can contract this illness. The infection
is also carried by pigeons and parrots.
According to the Kaluga city veterinary office, while the outbreak has been
located, the veterinarians are continuing to investigate sick birds. Alive
and dead pigeons have been delivered to the vet's office for laboratory
investigations.
"This is a very dangerous disease!," so the virologists commented on the
developing situation in the local newspaper Kaluzhskaya nedelya. "Almost
all birds from this illness perish." Fortunately, to date fatal cases from
Newcastle virus have not been reported in chickens in the Kaluga region.

[In the beginning of 2006, hundreds of poultry died from Newcastle disease
in the South of Russia in the republic of Dagestan; local poultry farms in
the Stavropol and Krasnodar regions suffered a significant economic loss.
Kaluga is located in the central part of Russia, close to Moscow. - Mod.NP]
[It is interesting that it seems that Newcastle disease in pigeons is
reported more often in ProMED for Russia than in poultry. OIE has 7 poultry
outbreaks and 5 pigeon outbreaks in Russia in 2004 (2005 data has yet to be
posted); 2003 (3 poultry outbreaks); 2002 (yes but no number); 2001 (2);
2000 (11); 1999 (2); 1998 (2); 1997 (1); and 1996 (5). - Mod.MHJ]
