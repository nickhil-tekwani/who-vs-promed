NEMATODES, WHITE MOULD AND ASIAN LEAF RUST, SOYBEAN - BRAZIL: (BAHIA,

Farmers are starting to see some nematode problems in their soybeans
in Bahia. They say they regularly have white mold and rust problems.
"We've had record white mold this year [2010], plus rust problems,"
explains Luis Henrique, crop consultant.

Like for most of Brazil, Asian soybean rust is a problem in the state
of Mato Grosso. "Nematodes are getting worse and worse all the time.
It's a very serious problem, and it's a limiting factor to higher
yields," a farmer says.

Soybean cyst nematode is the number one nematode battle being fought
in Mato Grosso, followed by lesion nematode, then root knot nematode,
says Flavio Silva, Syngenta soybean breeder. "Some farmers here don't
believe nematodes are one of the main reasons for reduced yield of
soybeans," he says. "Identification is the 1st step in pest
management; then use resistant or tolerant cultivars, crop rotation
and chemical control."

[Soybean cyst nematode (_Heterodera glycines_) is considered one of
the most destructive pests of the crop, with yield losses of more
than 30 percent. It has also been reported to contribute to disease
complexes such as sudden death syndrome and top dieback. Several
species of other nematodes, including lesion nematodes
(_Pratylenchus_) spp. and root-knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ spp.)
are also known to affect vigour and yield of soybean crops. The
pathogens can often persist in the soil for years and are spread by
plant material, soil, and mechanical means (for example contaminated
equipment). Once they have been established in an area, it is
difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management requires
an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures,
nematicides, and use of resistant crop varieties.

White mould (or sclerotinia stem rot) of soybean is caused by
_Sclerotinia sclerotiorum_ which is known to affect around 400 hosts.
Symptoms on soybean include white fungal growth on the stems leading
to wilting and final death of the plant. Severe yield losses have
been reported in soybean and other crops. The pathogen can survive
for many years in soil as sclerotia. It is spread primarily with
soil, but also by infected plant material (including seeds),
mechanical means, and wind-borne spores. Risk of crop infection
depends on the previous disease history of an area as well as weather
conditions. Disease management includes mainly cultural practices and
fungicide applications.

Asian leaf rust (also called soybean rust, Asian rust) of soybean is
caused by the fungus _Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and can result in yield
losses of soybean crops of up to 70 percent. It is widespread in Asia
and Africa and is spreading in the Americas. Over 30 other species of
_Fabaceae_ may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Spores are spread by
splashing rain or by wind over long distances. Fungicides may be used
in disease management, but timing of applications is considered
important. Partially resistant soybean lines are available. New
fungal strains with increased virulence and fungicide resistances are
emerging in Brazil (ProMED-mail post 20090501.1644) and other soybean
producing countries.
