Second case of amebic meningitis brings renewed warning from TDH
A second death this summer from a rare and dangerous form of meningitis has
prompted the Texas Department of Health (TDH) to issue a renewed warning
about swimming in lakes, rivers and stagnant water. The ameba that causes
the infection, _Naegleria fowleri_, thrives in fresh water when
temperatures are high, usually above 80 F.
The disease, called primary amebic meningoencephalitis or PAM, is caused by
a common microorganism found in most untreated surface water and all types
of soil. During drought and high temperature conditions, concentrations of
the amoebae increase as they feed on the bacteria in warm water.
In this latest case, a 10-year-old boy died Tuesday in Fort Worth. The
child, who had been hospitalized since Sunday, had gone swimming in the
Brazos River in Somervell County. In July, a 9-year-old Oklahoma child
died from PAM after swimming in Lake Arrowhead near Wichita Falls.
The PAM infection occurs when water containing the organisms is forcefully
inhaled _ usually from diving, jumping or underwater swimming. The amoebae
in the water then make their way into the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms
of the infection include severe headache, high fever, stiff neck, nausea,
vomiting, seizures and hallucinations as the condition worsens. Those
infected do not infect others. Although the disease is rare, affecting
only about one to three people in Texas a year, for those infected, death
occurs usually within a week.
Swimming pools properly cleaned, maintained and treated with chlorine
generally are safe as is salt water. In addition, TDH recommends that
people never swim in stagnant or polluted water and that people hold their
nose or use plugs when jumping into lakes, rivers, ponds or other bodies of
fresh water.

817-264-4459; Dr. Kate Hendricks, Infectious Disease Epidemiology, at

The increased bacterial growth serves to supply the amoebae with an
increased food supply which then fosters the reproduction of the amoebae.
Might not some kind of predictive tool been used to anticipate this
problem? For how long have we known that high water temps foster bacterial
growth? Will we remember this next year, or whenever Texas again
experiences this extreme weather?
