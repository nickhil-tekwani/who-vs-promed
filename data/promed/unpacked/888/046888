Taibei News, Taibei County. On 21st of last month [21 Jun 2000, an
80-year-old man of a local city of Taibei County was confirmed to have
contracted 0139 type cholera.
Because the diagnosis was many days later, the health department could not
inspect that day's cooked food. There was no way to confirm which dish
caused the trouble. They could only carry out a personal inspection of the
participating banquet guests, the chef, and the ones who served the meal.
The result was the new detection of 2 women disease carriers. Although
neither of them had the disease, they were still contagious and are now
receiving treatment in an isolation hospital.
Statistics of the Taiwan Health Department Infectious Disease Control
Bureau show there were 2 confirmed cases of cholera this year, the 2
examples of healthy disease carriers. This banquet is the first time in
recent years in Miaoli County that there has been a transmission of cholera
within a group.

[This report has only just come to our attention. It is notable because it
refers to the O139 strain, which is lurking in Asia waiting to produce the
next cholera pandemic. ­ Mod.JW
