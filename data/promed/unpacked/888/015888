Hungary's animal health authorities have detected the swine fever
virus in 3 wild boar in northern Hungary, but they said it may have
been caused by vaccination in nearby Slovakia. "Yes, we have found 3
wild boar in which we found the swine fever virus," Reuters cited
Chief Veterinarian Miklos Suth as telling a press conference on
Tuesday [23 Jan 2007].
Bulgarian veterinary health authorities announced on 17 Jan 2007 that
they had detected an outbreak of swine fever in the northeast of the
country and were preparing to slaughter 164 pigs to prevent its
spread. The disease caused the death of 4 pigs and 10 more animals
were also said to be infected at a farm in the town of Smyadovo.
