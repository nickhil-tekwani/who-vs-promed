8 Oct 2006: communication No. 7 -- Ministry of Health/Social Security
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MINSA) informs the general population that only the
medicine "Lisinopril Normon" (and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor
used by patients with hypertension), and not another medication or another
form of this product, has been recalled in the national market and health
facilities.
This measure was adopted as a preventive measure, as soon as the health
authorities knew that a number of patients were affected with
gastrointestinal disorders, renal insufficiency, and neurologic alterations
of recent onset, whose hypertension controlled by this medication was the
one common element [between the patients].
In this sense, it is reiterated that the community abstain from using this
product until health authorities indicate differently. The substitute
medication to be taken should be determined by a physician and is subject
to diverse therapeutic plans recommended for the treatment of arterial
hypertension, taking into consideration the age and additional conditions
such as other diseases.
Below are details on the medical facilities qualified by the health
institution, referred to as Health Centers and Hospitals, where people can
return the recalled medicines and receive medicines substituting for the
Lisinopril Normon previously prescribed by a doctor.
Health Centers: San Isidro, Torrijos Carter, Veranillo, Cerro Batea,
Alcalde Diaz y Chilibre, Juan Diaz y Parque Lefevre.
Hospitals: Rafael Hernandez de David, Luis iChichoi Fabrega de Veraguas,
Aquilino Tejeira de Cocle, Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas de las Tablas,
Nicolas A. Solano de La Chorrera y Amador Guerrero de Colon.
The Ministry of Health has opened telephone lines for further information
and to clear up any doubts on the part of the population: 800-55-00,
512-9607, 512-9609.

Spain's Normon says drug not behind Panama deaths
-------------------------------------------------
Spanish drug maker Normon SA said on Sunday [8 Oct 2006] that its
hypertension tablets were not the cause of a mystery illness in Panama that
has killed 20 people over the past month.
Panama withdrew some 2 million lisinopril tablets over the weekend from
pharmacies, hospitals and private clinics after noticing that 9 of the
people who fell sick with the illness had been taking the drug. Five of the
9 have died.
On Sunday [8 Oct 2006] night, health minister Camilo Alleyne said the death
toll from the illness had risen by one to 20, and another person had become
ill, leaving a total of 11 sick. Health officials say damage to kidney and
nerve tissue spotted during postmortem examinations of the victims pointed
to possible toxic agents being involved.
"We insist that only a minority consumed this product, which seems to leave
it clear that Lisinopril Normon is not responsible for this situation,"
Normon said in a statement. It said its scientists, along with officials at
the company that distributes the generic drug in Panama, analyzed batches
of the tablets in Panama and found them to be normal. "We can guarantee
that the product is in perfect condition," Normon said, noting it had sold
Lisinopril internationally for 15 years with no problems. Executives and
scientists from Madrid-based Normon arrived in Panama on Saturday [7 Oct
2006] to help with the investigation, Alleyne said. The minister said
government scientists also tested the tablets and detected no toxic agents.
He said the drug's recall was a precautionary move.
About 7000 Panamanians are taking lisinopril through the public health
system. More may take it through private clinics.
The mystery illness starts with nausea, fever, weakness and diarrhea and
quickly progresses to acute kidney failure, partial paralysis, and death.
Lisinopril, used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure, is made by
several companies. The version made by Normon, a laboratory specializing in
generic medicines, arrived on the Panamanian market in mid-August [2006],
shortly before the illness broke out.
The illness has mainly struck men over age 60 being treated for high blood
pressure, diabetes and kidney disorders. The fact that several were taking
lisinopril made investigators wonder whether there could be a contaminated
batch.
Normon sells its drugs in Europe, Central and South America, Asia and Africa.
Panamanian and US scientists working on the case have ruled out illnesses
like dengue fever and West Nile virus.

[A national recall of a pharmaceutical product is not usually a casual
undertaking. Hence, while the above newswire mentions that only 9 cases
(out of ?? cases -- perhaps there have been 31 cases identified -- 20
deaths and another 11 ill according to the newswire above) had a history of
taking the medication, it is possible that other patients' medication
histories were incomplete, and they may possibly have been exposed to the
medication prior to the onset of illness. Further "circumstantial" evidence
is that according to the above newswire, the syndrome appeared a few weeks
after the introduction of this medication into the Panamanian market. Of
note though, in an earlier posting on this, there was a Ministry of Health
Statement that there may have been cases as early as June 2006.
Clearly, there is a need for further information, and we look forward to
official reports on continued studies into this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
