The State Secretariat of Health of Rio Grande do Sul confirmed on Monday [9
Feb 2009] the 4th death from yellow fever [YF] in the state. The victim, a
36 year old miner, lived in Muriae (Minas Gerais), and contracted the
disease in December [2008], while working in the rural areas of Jola, north
west Rio Grande do Sul, a municipality in the area considered at [yellow
fever] risk. 3 suspected cases are still in under investigation.

The area at risk of yellow fever now includes 134 municipalities of the
northern, north west, and central regions of the state with a total
population of 1.75 million, of which 88 per cent are already vaccinated.
According to [state secretary of health], Osmar Terra, there have been 25
days with no new confirmed cases of yellow fever in the state.

According to the Secretariat of Health of Rio Grande do Sul, the mosquito
transmitters (_Haemagogus_ and _Sabethes_) usually mainly feed on primates
such as howler monkeys living in gallery forests, while the infection of
humans is occasional. From October of the past year [2008] until mid
January this year [2009], 419 [monkeys] were found dead with symptoms of
the disease. Yellow fever [virus] is transmitted to humans by _Haemagogus_
mosquitoes.

"This mosquito does not come out of the forest, so we are speaking of
sylvan [jungle] yellow fever. It is not urban yellow fever and it is not
dengue that occurs in the urban area. Only those who enter the forest
without [prior] vaccination run the risk of contracting the disease,"
explained Terra. According to Terra, the primates of the region were not
immune to yellow fever [virus] because they had not been exposed to the
virus that causes the disease.

The main symptoms of yellow fever are high fever, headache, strong muscle
pain, chills, fatigue, vomiting, and diarrhea. Those who travel to an area
of risk should take the vaccine 10 days before. The vaccination lasts for
10 years.

No yellow fever [human] deaths had been recorded in Rio Grande do Sul since
1966. The other [YF] confirmed victims this year [2009] were a man from
Santo Angelo, in the Missoes region, who died on 9 Feb [2009]; a 28 year
old man resident of the Nova Santa Rita municipality in the metropolitan
area of Porto Alegre; and a resident of St Angelo, 31 years old, who
presented with symptoms of the disease on 18 December [2008] and died on
Christmas day [25 Dec 2008].

According to Terra, the occurrence of yellow fever is a consequence of
increased population of mosquitoes that transmit the disease [virus] as a
result of climate changes. According to him, "clouds of mosquitoes" spread
through areas of forest. "This has something to do with climate change.
Something is happening, because the population of mosquitoes is increasing.
Due to climate change, we are bringing back a risk that was distant for a
long time," the secretary lamented.

[There is no need to seek look for explanations in [climate] warming,
either global or otherwise. What is happening in the south of the country,
as in Argentina and Paraguay, is nothing more than the normal behavior of
yellow fever. The cycles are long, difficult to predict, and challenge
simplistic explanations. - Mod.JLS]

Yellow fever virus is know for its "wandering foci" in the tropical forests
of South America. Without objective measures to quantify increases in
temperature and increases in YF virus vector mosquito populations,
attributing YF occurrence to climate change is conjectural. - Mod.JLS'
explanation of wandering foci is more likely.
