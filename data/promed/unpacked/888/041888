Two civilian workers in San Buenaventura (Iturralde province [La Paz department]) were infected with [a] hantavirus and died. Another person is currently recuperating. The Departmental Health Service (SEDES) yesterday [28 Jan 2013] declared a health alert in northern La Paz [department].

"Two cases of [a] hantavirus [infection] were found in San Buenaventura. We were informed that they were associated with the armed forces. This has obligated us to declare a health alert," stated the La Paz SEDES Director Gustavo Marconi.

The official explained that the 2 people worked in construction of the sugar refinery in the region and had their camp adjoining that of the members of the armed forces. This medium tried to communicate with the armed forces commander, General Edwin de la Fuente, and the director of the armed forces cooperative (COFADENA), General Antonio Quiroga, but their staff members indicated that these authorities did not know about the matter.

However, the national director of epidemiology, Johnny Rada, stated that there are 3 reported cases, 2 of whom died before laboratory tests were done, but the 3rd was confirmed as [a] hantavirus [infection]. "For the Ministry of Health one case is confirmed, who is recuperating, and the 2 others who died are [considered cases] due to their epidemiological connections (a concept that permits one to accurately associate [with a disease] certain very common clinical pictures)."

The people who died were La Paz residents; one was 39 years old and the other 21 years old. The cases had been reported on 24 Dec [2012]. Due to their initial symptoms, they were treated for pneumonia and, given the seriousness of their condition, were transferred to the government capital [La Paz city and vicinity]. One of the patients was admitted to the National Thorax Institute [in La Paz city] and the other to the Nueva Esperanza clinic in El Alto, where they died. The 3rd person is recuperating in a health center.

The 1st report of [a] hantavirus in Bolivia was issued in 1996, in the Rio Mamore (Beni [department]), when scientists trapped a mouse infected with the disease [virus]. The following year, the disease was found in a person. In 2000, the 1st 6 cases in humans were reported in Tarija [department]. Later, reports were issued of ill and dead individuals in Beni, Santa Cruz, and Cochabamba [departments].

Rada stated that for the year 2012 to date, 19 confirmed cases of hantavirus [infections] with 5 deaths have been reported in the country. With the report of the 2 deaths, the La Paz SEDES Director reported that a contingency plan has been developed and will be put into action in coming hours to avoid the spread of the virus in the region.

"We are sending specialists in [hantavirus epidemiology] to San Buenaventura, as well as technicians to help with vegetation removal in the area. The experts will carry out a rodent population study in the area to determine contingency plan [actions]," he said.

He explained that the technicians will remove the vegetation in a 150 meter [492 ft] area around the camp, to avoid the mice coming into the site. According to Marconi, the virus is spread by the rodents through their urine, excrement, and saliva. "Small droplets with the virus can float in the air and the people who are close by acquire it when breathing contaminated air or when they come into contact with the rodents or their excrement in food," he said. He clarified [the fact] that the infection does not occur between people, just from rodents to people. He also added that in about 10 days the health alert [will be lifted] and the situation controlled.

During 2012, a total of 18 cases were reported, of which Beni had one case, Santa Cruz (8 cases), and Tarija (9 cases). Of these, 5 died, 3 in Tarija and 2 in Santa Cruz. The case fatality rate was 26 per cent, according to the report from the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health.

[The specific hantavirus involved in these 3 cases, or those in 2012, are not given. In the lowland Amazon Basin of Bolivia, the possible hantavirus, its rodent hosts, and their images that might be involved in these hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases is Laguna Negra virus (_Calomys laucha_ http://www.faunaparaguay.com/images/Calomys%20laucha%20enciso%2031aug2011.jpg and _C. callosus_ https://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/Calomyscallosusb.jpg). Other hantaviruses and their rodent hosts that have been found in lowland Bolivia and can cause HPS include:
