The discovery of a dead wild boar infected with African swine fever [ASF] in zone I north, between Les Fossés and Mellier (Léglise), required adjustment of the limits of the restricted areas. The change was applied in cooperation with the European Commission. Zone I (buffer zone) and zone II (contaminated zone) were expanded to the north.[The updated map is available at http://tinyurl.com/yydw7a3f - Mod.AS].

To date, 687 cases of ASF have been detected in wild boar. As a reminder, the 1st cases of ASF were discovered on [13 Sep 2018] in wild boar found dead in the Etalle region, in the province of Luxembourg. An infected zone was defined on [14 Sep 2018] around the infections by the AFSCA and the Walloon region. Measures were taken in this zone, both for wild boar and kept pigs. All domestic pigs were culled between [29 Sep and 2 Oct 2018] as a result of a decision by the Federal Minister of Agriculture. The repopulation of the holdings in this zone is prohibited until further notice.

To comply with European legislation, the infected zone was revised on the [23 Nov 2018] in consultation with the European Commission and replaced by 2 separate zones: a zone I and a zone II. Zone II is the zone where the infected wild boar are located. The zone I is a buffer zone that completely surrounds the zone II and contains a part of the old infected zone (= zone I south) and a new zone north of the infected zone (= zone I north).

In these zones I and II, measures apply to both wild boar and domestic pigs, in accordance with European legislation.

The measures for the wild boar and all forest activities that the Walloon Region has taken can be consulted on the following link: http://www.wallonie.be/fr/actualites/mesures-de-lutte-contre-la-peste porcine africaine [in French].

The current zones are:
Belgium - Reinforced observation (part I), Vigilance zone (part I), Kernel zone (part II).
France - 'white' depopulation zone, observation zone, Reinforced observation zone south.
Luxembourg - Surveillance zone.

On 18 Mar 2019, Belgium submitted to the OIE its 26th ASF follow-up report, with details of 23 new outbreaks in wild boar, detected between 1 - 13 Mar 2019, and a map presenting their respective locations; see at http://tinyurl.com/y5ezaooz. - Mod.AS
