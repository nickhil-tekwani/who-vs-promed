On 28 Jun [2007], 20 school children from Khmelnik and the
surrounding villages of Blestka and Sokolovka (Vinnyts'ka region)
were hospitalized with a preliminary diagnosis of "meningitis".
According to Aleksandr Jupanov, head of the Agency for Healthcare for
the Vinnyts'ka region, the children were admitted to the Khmelnik
Central Hospital with severe headache and nausea. Of the 20 cases, 2
were ranked as moderate, 17 as mild, and one was not confirmed by
laboratory diagnosis. The outbreak has been attributed preliminarily
to swimming in local water bodies during hot weather.
A special commission, which includes specialists from the
sanitary-epidemiological service, departments of the Ministry of
Emergencies, and local physicians, has been set up to investigate the
outbreak. The situation is being evaluated. The Khmelnik regional
[public health authority] has temporarily prohibited swimming
activities in local water bodies.
Meningitis is an infectious disease with inflammation of the cerebral
and medullar membranes, which can be caused by bacteria, viruses,
_Chlamydia_, _Mycoplasma_, protozoa, or fungi. The infection can be
transmitted by contact and by airborne droplets.

[This report is not about meningococcal meningitis, as there is
preliminary information about the connection with swimming. In
addition, the condition of all the patients is moderate, whereas in
the case of meningococcal meningitis the severity of the cases would
be grave.
The outbreak is probably due to enterovirus, which can manifest also
as serous meningitis. Serological tests would help to clarify the
cause of disease. The restriction of swimming activities would also
help, but the situation may get out of control because of the
possibility of air droplet spread. - Corr.VM
