Poisonous fish teems in Dagupan rivers
-------------------------------------------
Renewed warnings against catching, selling and eating the poisonous
species of the goby fish were issued over the weekend [25-26 June
2005] by the City Agriculture Office, after samples of the fish were
caught by local fishermen in their fish traps along Calmay river in
the island barangay of Pugaro. Locally called "bonor" ("biya" in
Tagalog or "bunog" in Ilocano), the fish contains a toxic substance
called tetrodotoxin that is also present in the puffer fish (locally
called "botete").

City Agriculture Officer Emma Molina said that, with the discovery of
the Pugaro fishermen, it is now confirmed that the species (_Gobius
crininger_) is now endemic in the city's river system, and people
must be warned not to eat bonor to avoid poisoning.

Consumption of the goby fish was behind the deaths of 3 persons and
the hospitalization of 26 others from Barangay Capantolan, in Sual
town, on 30 May 2005. Another man from Barangay Sabangan, in Dagupan,
died, also after eating the fish, last 1 Jun 2005. The victims all
suffered numbness in the tongue, lips and limbs 30 minutes to an hour
after dining on the deadly bonor.

Molina said she has posted some of her men in the fish market
round-the-clock to watch out for vendors selling goby fish. She
expressed some apprehension, however, about those selling fish
door-to-door and fishermen who catch the fish and immediately cook it
for their family's consumption.

As an added attempt at public information, she said blown-up pictures
of the live samples of the goby fish caught by fishermen will be
distributed citywide by authorities to forewarn people against eating
the fish.

posting on this topic. It does not appear that any additional deaths
or intoxications have been attributed to the increase in prevalence
of this fish species. - Mod.LM]
