Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in Republic of Tatarstan
--------------------------------------------------------------
During the past week [18-24 Oct 2010] 17 cases of hemorrhagic fever
with renal syndrome (HFRS) were recorded in the Republic of Tatarstan
according to the regional office of Rospotrebnadzor [Federal Agency
for Consumer Protection and Welfare]. Most of the cases were
registered in Kazan [the capital of Tatarstan]. Some cases were
recorded also in the city of Naberezhni Chelni, and the remainder in
the districts [rayons] of Nizhnekamsk, Almetevski, Leninogorsk, and
Sarmanovski.

[Although not specifically stated, it is likely that Pummala virus is
the specific hantavirus responsible for this outbreak of HFRS in
Tatarstan, and the rodent reservoir is the bank vole (_Myodes
glareolus_; see image at <http://www.the-piedpiper.co.uk/th1r.htm>).
In some places the original text is ambiguous and some of the cases
may have been diagnosed as Lyme disease, another tick-transmitted
infection. Cases of HFRS earlier in the year (2010) were attributed
to an increase in the rodent population throughout Tatarstan.

The Republic of Tatarstan is located in the east central part of
European Russia. The Republic lies in the middle Volga River basin
around the confluence of the Volga and Kama rivers. The landscape is
that of a low, rolling plain. Kazan is the capital. A map of the
