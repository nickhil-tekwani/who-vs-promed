Ebenezer Israel, the St. Mary's County health officer, was cited as saying
today that faulty cooking of stuffed ham probably caused an outbreak of
salmonellosis among patrons of a Maryland church dinner that left 746
people ill and one dead. Israel added that the hams were steamed in large
pots at a commercial seafood distributor rather than boiled at
parishioners' homes, and it was the second year that hams were prepared
using the new method, which was meant to ensure safe practices.
The problem appeared to be that steam was not able to fully penetrate all
the hams, which were boiled in three large pots. As a result, temperatures
probably were not high enough to kill salmonella microbes on the hams.
It was the first mass illness in more than 50 years of the church dinners.
An 81-year-old woman died from food poisoning after eating a church meal
that was brought to her home and some three dozen people were hospitalized.

[It is indeed ironic that steps to ensure food safety by instituting more
reliable cooking methods wind up as part of the causal web leading to an
outbreak of salmonellosis. It is important to remember that the faulty
cooking was the last in a series of food safety missteps starting at the
farm and continuing until the ham was eaten. - Mod.PC
