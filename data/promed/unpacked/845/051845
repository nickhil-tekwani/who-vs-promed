[CDC estimates this epidemic may have killed at least 478 people and
affected 89,000 - Mod.JW
Rift Valley fever - East Africa: 1997-98
In December 1997, the Kenyan Ministry of Health and the World Health
Organization (WHO) in Nairobi received reports of 478 unexplained deaths
in the North Eastern province of Kenya and southern Somalia. Clinical
features included acute onset of fever and headache associated with
haemorrhage (bloody stools, vomiting with blood, and bleeding from other
mucosal sites). Local health officials also reported high rates of
spontaneous abortion and deaths from haemorrhage among domestic animals
in the area. Diagnostic testing of 36 human specimens at the National
Institute of Virology, South Africa, and at the United States Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta confirmed acute
infection with Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in 15 (42%) by detection
of IgM antibodies, virus isolation, reverse transcriptase polymerase
chain reaction for viral nucleic acid, or immunohistochemistry. This
report describes the preliminary results of the outbreak investigation
and includes case descriptions and the results of a serological survey.
Editorial Note: RVFV was first isolated in Kenya in 1930, and recognised
as the aetiological agent for a zoonotic disease of sub-Saharan Africa
associated with substantial perinatal mortality and abortions. Extension
of disease into Egypt for the first time during 1977-78 was associated
with official estimates of 18,000 human infections and 598 deaths, with
almost universal abortion in pregnant ewes and death among lambs.
Epizootics occur periodically after heavy rains flood valleys and allow
the primary vector and reservoir (_Aedes_ spp. mosquitoes) to hatch. High
levels of viraemia in animals lead to infection of secondary arthropod
vector species, virus amplification in livestock, and collateral
infection of humans. As noted in this outbreak, transmission to humans
can also result from contact with blood or body fluids from viraemic
animals. Humans usually suffer a mild febrile illness, but between 1%
and 2% of infections may result in a fatal haemorrhagic fever or
encephalitis. A higher proportion of patients develop vascular retinitis
with permanent partial loss of vision.
The numbers of people infected and the economic losses that have
resulted from the outbreak described in this report are difficult to
estimate. Preliminary estimates of deaths among animals and humans
suggest that this may be the largest reported outbreak of RVFV in East
Africa and the first to be officially recorded in Somalia. On the basis
of the antibody prevalence data and the assumption that all residents of
the North Eastern province and southern Somalia were at risk of
infection, a total of 89,000 human infections may be estimated to have
arisen in this region. This does not include infections in the rest of
Kenya and neighbouring countries_Preliminary laboratory results have
confirmed infections with other viral agents, malaria, shigella
dysentery, and leptospirosis as explanations for some of the reported
cases that met the case definition but were negative for RVFV serology
tests. Studies in progress may help define the size and identify
additional aetiological agents associated with this outbreak.
Satellite and precipitation data documented widespread high levels of
rainfall and increased vegetation compared with equivalent periods of
previous years; these conditions would have supported RVFV transmission
throughout Kenya and the surrounding countries_The extent of RVFV
transmission and the inevitability that outbreaks will recur make it
vital to develop and validate methods to predict, prevent, and treat
RVF. Longitudinal studies are needed to validate remote sensing
satellite data to target areas for animal vaccination, enhance animal
and human surveillance activities, and permit prospective entomological
studies. Earlier identification of disease will allow new antiviral
drugs to be tested.

Report (1998; 47(13) of 10 April) and Weekly Epidemiological Record
