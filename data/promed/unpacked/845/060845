Travellers to Greece have been warned to take precautions against
mosquito bites following 6 reported cases of malaria since June
[2011].

None of the victims -- 5 Greek adults and a Roma child -- had any
history of travel to a country where the disease is commonplace.

The cases occurred in the Laconia region of the southern Peloponnesus
and on Euboea, a large island north of Athens. Greek authorities have
responded with enhanced surveillance of malaria in the 2 areas, and
intensified mosquito control programmes. Awareness has also been
raised among doctors and local residents.

Professor David Hill, director of the Health Protection Agency's
National Travel Health Network and Centre, said: "The risk to
holidaymakers of catching malaria while in Greece remains extremely
low, so there is no need to take anti-malarial medication when
visiting this country, but travellers should take measures to prevent
being bitten.

"We already advise people travelling to Greece to prevent insect bites
to protect against another mosquito-borne infection caused by West
Nile virus," he added. "This can cause a nervous system disease and
over 200 cases were reported in Greece last year [2010]. The recent
cases of malaria in Greece reinforce the importance of taking
precautions against being bitten while on holiday."

Holidaymakers returning from the affected areas who experience
symptoms of malaria -- which include fever, headache, and muscle pains
-- should seek immediate medical advice.

[We agree with the Health Protection Agency that the risk of malaria
in travellers is extremely low in Greece. If no further cases are
reported, the most likely explanation is still limited transmission by
local mosquitoes infected from asymptomatic gametocyte carriers
infected outside Greece.

This occurs frequently as illustrated by such cases reported by
ProMED-mail listed below. Except for Jamaica, these cases never
resulted in sustained local transmission.
