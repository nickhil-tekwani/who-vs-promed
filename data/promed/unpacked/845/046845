Up to now this year [2012], Beijing has reported 36 000 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease. Yesterday [27 Oct 2012], the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission announced that a hand, foot and mouth disease vaccine is expected to be approved and marketed next year [2013]. This vaccine will be administered to children under 6 months of age.

According to the Beijing CDC [Centre for Disease Control], this year [2012], Beijing [with a population of about 19.6 million] has reported a total of about 36 000 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease, a 40 percent increase over the same period last year. [At present] there is no vaccine or specific drug available for treatment of hand, foot and mouth disease virus infection.

The Beijing CDC said previous monitoring data showed that the incidence of HFMD in Beijing increases during the summer months. In 2011, there were 2 peaks, May to August 2011 and then again in November 2011, the 2nd incidence peak being significantly lower than the 1st peak. Although Beijing has now entered the low peak period for the current year [2012], cases are still being diagnosed, and the outbreak may persist into the winter.

According to the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, a vaccine is currently under development against this disease, which affects mainly children under 5 years of age. It is understood that human enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the major pathogen causing human hand, foot and mouth disease, and 2 companies are engaged in development of an inactivated vaccine to control this disease. In one project, Phase III clinical trials are expected to be completed this year [2012]. The vaccine is expected to be approved next year. The EV71 inactivated vaccine will be suitable for administration to children over 6 months of age. However, the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, said EV71 inactivated vaccine is still in the research and development stage.

HFMD is caused by a variety of enteroviruses, mainly affecting children under 5 years of age with an incidence highest in children under 3 years of age. The majority of children have mild symptoms, mainly fever and rashes affecting the hands, feet and mouth. Under normal circumstances, most patients recover within about a week, but a few cases may lead to meningitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, and pneumonia, with some children experiencing severe illness sometimes leading to death.

[It remains to be seen to what extent a vaccine against human enterovirus 71 would affect the incidence of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD). Although human enterovirus 71 virus infection has been associated with the more serious outcomes of hand, foot and mouth disease, it is likely that many other human enteroviruses are implicated in this disease, which is to some extent associated with inadequate hygiene.

It is clear from research in Viet Nam and elsewhere that the epidemiology of HFMD is complex and that human enterovirus 71 is one of several enteroviruses causing this disease. Furthermore, a great diversity of human enterovirus 71 strains circulate globally, and no particular genotype has been specifically associated with severe disease. Different human enteroviruses co-circulate in the community annually. According to a recent review (Lee, T.C. et al., Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2009 Oct;28(10):904-10), the emergence in recent years of the human enterovirus 71 epidemic in the Asia Pacific region has been associated with the circulation of 5 genetic lineages (genotypes B3, B4, C1, C2, C4) that appear to be undergoing rapid evolutionary changes. More recent reports indicate that sub-genotype C4 predominates in China at the present time (Mao LX, et al., J Clin Virol. 2010 Oct;49(2):100-4). Further information on the specificities of the vaccine(s) under development would be welcomed.
