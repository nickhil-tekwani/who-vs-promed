Five people have been admitted to hospital on Indonesia's Sulawesi island
with bird flu-like symptoms and local authorities have sought funds from
the government to help cull poultry, officials said on Wed 30 Aug 2006.
Samples from the patients in Palu, the capital of Central Sulawesi
province, have been sent to a government laboratory in Jakarta to be tested
for bird flu, said Runizar Ruesin, head of the Ministry's bird flu
information centre. No further details about the 5 people were available.
Indonesia has so far recorded 60 bird flu cases, 46 of them fatal. The
country's death toll is the highest in the world.
Zulkarnain Hassan, a coordinator at the agriculture ministry's Avian
Influenza Crisis Centre, said that there had been bird flu cases in poultry
in West and South Palu district and the provincial capital of Palu city. An
official of the agriculture ministry in Palu said the local government did
not have enough money to compensate farmers for culling their birds and had
asked Jakarta for more funds.
"(Culling) is something that must be done," he said, adding that some
slaughtering had started in the region on Wed 30 Aug 2006. He did not say
how many chickens needed to be killed or how much the work would cost. Bayu
Krisnamurthi, head of the national bird flu control commission, said the
central government would reimburse funds spent by local governments or
compensate farmers.
Separately, the government will on Fri 1 Sep 2006 embark on a new campaign
to raise awareness about bird flu through television and radio
advertisements, leaflets, posters and billboards, said Tri Satya Naipospos,
deputy chief of the National Committee for Avian Influenza Control and
Pandemic Preparedness. "So far our campaign has been spotty. We realise
that human cases have occurred in regions where people are ignorant about
bird flu and they don't have the means to support our efforts," she said,
declining to give the cost of the campaign.
Experts said public ignorance, along with official ineptitude and lack of
money, are hampering efforts to stamp out the disease in the country of 220
million. Farmers often oppose the destruction of their fowl because of low
compensation. A full-grown chicken sells for 35 000 rupiah [USD 3.85] in
Jakarta, but the government only offers between 10 000-12 500 [USD
1.10-1.37] for each fowl killed.
Although bird flu remains essentially an animal disease, experts fear it
could mutate into a form that can pass easily among humans, killing
millions. New fears that the virus had mutated into a form that can easily
pass between humans arose this month after a series of confirmed or
suspected cases in West Java's remote Cikelet village, where bird flu is
rife in poultry. The World Health Organization (WHO) said there is no
evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred in the area.
