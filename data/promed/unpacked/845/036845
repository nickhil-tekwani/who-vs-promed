A serious polio epidemic was declared in the town of Kikwit, in the
south-west of the Democratic Republic of Congo, along the border with
Angola.

In a statement released yesterday [8 Dec 2010], the mayor of the town
formalised the concerns regarding the health sector after the rapid
increase of polio cases in the area, where 90 percent of cases on a
national level were registered. Based on the latest update by the
mayor, 36 cases were registered just in Kikwit and the outskirts, 15
of which were fatal. The mayor also announced a sensitisation
campaign and urgent mass vaccinations.

In the neighbouring Republic of Congo, a serious polio epidemic
killed over 200 people in just over a month, paralysing some 409,
based on estimates of the World Health Organisation. Also, in the
cases registered in DR-Congo, polio is mainly affecting adult men,
while it normally affects children under the age of 5. Polio was
considered eradicated from DR-Congo when no cases were registered
between 2001 and 2005.

[According to the Polio Eradication Initiative website, circulation
of the wild poliovirus (WPV) has persisted for over 12 months
following the reintroduction of WPV into the country in 2006, and the
country has been classified as having re-established transmission.
Prior to 2006, the last reported WPV associated case was in 2000.
Since the reintroduction, there were 13 cases reported in 2006, 41
cases in 2007, 5 cases in 2008, 3 cases in 2009, and to date in 2010,
there have been 69 cases reported (the date of onset of the most
recent WPV1 virus isolate was 11 Nov 2010
<http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Wildpolioviruslist.aspx>).

The summary on the polio eradication website of the past week's
reports in the DRC is presented below:

- 9 new cases were reported in the past week (WPV1s), bringing the
total number of cases for 2010 to 69 (all WPV1s). The most recent
case had onset of paralysis on 11 Nov 2010 (from Bas-Congo).
- The majority of cases are reported from Kasai Occidental and
Bandundu provinces.
- A SNID was held from 23 Nov 2010 using a combination of bivalent
OPV, mOPV1 and trivalent OPV throughout most of the country.

The above newswire mentions that the epidemiology of these cases in
Kikwit is similar to that seen in the Republic of the Congo: adult
males, a curious observation. The vaccination coverages in the DRC
were less than optimal for many years (this moderator had been
involved in vaccination program activity evaluation in the former
Zaire back in the late 80s and early 90s). If this moderator
remembers correctly from the days of the Ebola outbreak in Kikwit,
the area is one of those areas with a high coverage of the
population's health services provided through missionary health
facilities and thereby may well have been a pocket of high
vaccination coverages, which would possibly explain an earlier
interruption of circulating WPV in the area with resultant pockets of
unvaccinated adults.

All of this is speculation in the absence of solid data from the
affected area. ProMED would greatly appreciate more information from
knowledgeable sources in the region.
