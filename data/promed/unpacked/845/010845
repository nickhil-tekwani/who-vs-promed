The background data on Dengue extracted from Gideon Software and presented
by Steve Berger in the message [referred to, while almost completely
accurate, are presented in a way that lead to confusion in some cases. I
recommend posting the following [corrections:
>>>
"- More than 500,000 cases (158 fatal) were reported during an epidemic in
1977-1981.."
>>>
No fatal cases were reported in the 1977-1981 epidemic [sic; should read
1977-1980 - Mod.JW. At that time no hemorrhagic dengue had been reported
in Cuba.
So, while it is true that more than 500,000 cases occurred, the figure of
158 fatalities is not correct.
>>>
" -Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) was first reported in 1981. 10,312 cases of
DHF (158 fatal) were reported during 1981 to 1996..."
>>>
This cumulative report from 1981 to 1996 may lead to the wrong perception
that dengue was circulating in Cuba after 1981.Dengue was absolutely
eradicated after the 1981 outbreak, and the 10 312 DHF cases and the 158
fatalities were produced in 1981. No dengue/DHF cases occurred from
1981-1996 [sic; should read 19982-1996 - Mod.JW.
>>>
" - No cases of dengue were reported during 1988 to 1992. 2,946 cases (205
DHF, 12 fatal) were reported from Santiago de Cuba during January to July
1997.."
>>>
As previously commented, there were no reports from 1981 [1982 -Mod.JW to
1996. The Santiago epidemic had actually 3,012 cases which were reported
from January to October 1997.
The rest of the data presented are absolutely correct, I [hope that this
comment may facilitate the interpretation of the data to those interested
and avoid any possible misunderstandings.

[We thank Dr Roges for this important clarification. We also note that
GIDEON stated that a serosurvey after the 1977 epidemic indicated that 42%
of the population had been infected during that time. If Cuba's population
then was 8 million, there must have been around 3.5 million cases, or 7
times the reported number - Mod.JW

Thanks to Mod.CHC for his comments.
In our report we emphasized that the strategy used in our country to
control Dengue and DHF has been successful and that both ways, "top-down"
and "bottom-up", are equally important.
In the [referenced outbreak, 204/205 cases of DHF/DSS occurred in adults,
only one case was reported in a child. Ninety eight percent of the DHF
cases had a secondary immunological response. The 12 fatal cases were
adults and 11 of them showed a secondary type of infection. We must
remember that today's children in Cuba were not born when Den 1 circulated
during the 1977 to 1981 period (17 to 20 years before the present
epidemic).
We have enough evidence as to prove that the circulation of dengue viruses
was interrupted between 1981 and 1997 (data to be published soon).
Currently, there is no dengue transmission in the island and we are doing
our best to eradicate the vector, or at least to maintain our condition of
'Country free of Dengue.'
>From the Rio Bravo [?Rio Grande, USA/Mexico border - Mod.JW to Patagonia
there are only two countries free of Dengue (Chile and Uruguay), whilst in
the Caribbean countries most of the islands reports dengue activity in
the last three years.
Incidentally, Mod.CHC called our attention [to something not directly
related to my report but to the prosecution of a Cuban practitioner still
in jail. As far as I know, this physician intentionally misinformed the
international scientific community and the international press media about
the magnitude and extension of the dengue epidemic in Santiago de Cuba and
he is facing charges contemplated by Cuban Law on this respect .Personally,
I have no any additional information about this matter.

[Thanks to Dr Kouri for this information. Regarding the case of the
imprisoned doctor, it was reported that he said the number of cases of
dengue in the Santiago de Cuba region was 10,000, with 30 deaths. Given
the official figures of 3,012 cases & 12 deaths, and the data from the
1977 epidemic indicating that the actual number of cases may be 7 times
the reported number (see my comment on post [1 above), it seems that he
may have greatly underestimated the number of cases, while possibly
over-estimating the number of deaths. In any case, we do not know of any
other country in the Americas that imprisons its physicians for incorrectly
estimating the number of cases in an epidemic - Mod.JW
