Canada (B.C.): Hiker's Rabies Death Believed to be Result of Bat bite
-------------------------------------------------
Health authorities at the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control
reported on Tue 4 Mar 2003 that a 52-year-old Lower Mainland man has
died from rabies. He is only the second person known to have died
from rabies in British Columbia. The earlier death occurred in 1985
after a 22-year-old man received a bat bite in Alberta.
The latest victim also is thought to have contracted the disease from
exposure to a bat, although that is not certain, said Rob Parker,
deputy medical health officer for the Fraser Health Authority.

[British Columbia has a large bat population, between 2 and 10
percent of which carry rabies (see ProMED-mail references below). In
the United States 24 (74 percent) of the 32 human rabies cases
reported since 1990 have been attributed to insectivorous
bat-associated variants of rabies virus.
Nonetheless a history of bat bite was established in only 2 cases.
Contact with bats occurred in approximately half of the other cases.
These cases represent various bat-contact histories: a bat bite,
direct contact with bats with multiple opportunities to be bitten,
and possible direct contact with a bat.
Although rabies is usually transmitted by a bite, persons may
minimize the medical implications of a bat bite. Unlike bites from
larger animals, the trauma of a bat bite is unlikely to warrant
seeking medical care. Unless the potential for rabies exposure is
known to the patient, rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) will not
be sought. Although bat rabies virus variants can be transmitted
secondarily from terrestrial mammals, the lack of other animal-bite
histories and the rarity of bat rabies virus variants found in
terrestrial mammals suggest that this means of transmission is rare.
