From: Jeff Drifmeyer <jdrifmeyer@usuhs.mil>

As you point out, the manner in which people potentially exposed to anthrax
were handled varied widely. In the span of just 2 weeks, 7 incidents [were
reported from California: 800 were "held", 20 people "isolated and
decontaminated", 24 were "stripped and decontaminated", 90 were "held for 8
hrs given special suits to wear over their own clothing and given
antibiotics", 1,500 were "quarantined for several hours", 200 were
"evacuated" (but not quarantined?), and 200 were "disrobed and rinsed with
a bleach solution".
As the task of first responders, law enforcement authorities etc. is
extremely difficult in these situations, it might be useful to the first
responder community at large if there were agreed upon protocols or other
decision aids available to optimize responses, i.e. when are quarantine,
antibiotics, decontamination recommended or required?
The 7 incidents cited above were reported from urban locations in
California. These communities probably have some of the better HAZMAT
response capabilities in the U.S., thus making incident response
information all the more helpful to those locals not so well equipped and
trained to respond to these incidents.

[Another point raised was whether first responders should be vaccinated.
While we are presently in the hoax-mode, we, unfortunately, cannot assume
that this will persist indefinitely. I would recommend that these people be
vaccinated. - Mod.MHJ
