The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today [5 Jun 2014] investigating 2 cases of severe pediatric enterovirus (EV) infection and hence urged the public to stay vigilant.

The 1st case involved a 2-month-old boy with good past health. He presented with fever and malaise since 2 Jun 2014. He was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital on 3 Jun 2014 and was admitted on the same day. He is now in stable condition. The clinical diagnosis was encephalitis. His cerebrospinal fluid was tested positive for enterovirus upon preliminary laboratory testing by Prince of Wales Hospital. Initial enquiries by the CHP revealed that the patient had no recent travel history. His home contacts remained asymptomatic. The CHP investigation is continuing.

The 2nd case involved a 4-year-old boy with good past health. He presented with fever, cough, throat ulcer as well as rash and vesicles over hands and feet since 20 May 2014. He was taken to the Accident and Emergency Department of Pamela Youde Nethersole Eastern Hospital on 24 May 2014 and was admitted on the same day. He was noted to have increased drowsiness and developed hypotonia on 26 May 2014. He is now in stable condition. The clinical diagnosis was encephalitis. His throat swab tested positive for enterovirus 71 (EV71) upon preliminary laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch. Initial enquiries by the CHP revealed that the patient had no recent travel history. Three of his home contacts had recovered from hand, foot and mouth disease, and the other home contacts remained asymptomatic. The CHP investigation is continuing.

[At least one of these 2 pediatric cases was shown to be caused by enterovirus 71 (EV 71), which may cause a particularly severe form of HFMD with central nervous system manifestations.

Although no commercial EV71 vaccine is yet available, a recent publication suggests a vaccine may be in the offing (Li R, Liu L, Mo Z, et al: An inactivated Enterovirus 71 vaccine in healthy children. N Engl J Med 2014; 370:829-837). The abstract is shown below:

"We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial involving healthy children 6 to 71 months of age in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Two doses of an inactivated EV71 vaccine or placebo were administered intramuscularly, with a 4-week interval between doses, and children were monitored for up to 11 months. The primary end point was protection against hand, foot, and mouth disease caused by EV71.

A total of 12 000 children were randomly assigned to receive vaccine or placebo. Serum neutralizing antibodies were assessed in 549 children who received the vaccine. The seroconversion rate was 100 percent 4 weeks after the 2 vaccinations, with a geometric mean titer of 170.6. Over the course of 2 epidemic seasons, the vaccine efficacy was 97.4 percent (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 92.9 to 99.0) according to the intention-to-treat analysis and 97.3 percent (95 percent CI, 92.6 to 99.0) according to the per-protocol analysis. Adverse events, such as fever (which occurred in 41.6 percent of the participants who received vaccine vs. 35.2 percent of those who received placebo) were significantly more common in the week after vaccination among children who received the vaccine than among those who received placebo." - Mod.LL
