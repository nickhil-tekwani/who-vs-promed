Novel coronavirus infection - update [23 Mar 2013]
---------------------
The Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia has informed the World Health Organization (WHO) of a new confirmed case of infection with the novel coronavirus (nCoV).

The patient is a contact of the previous case reported in the Disease Outbreak News on [12 Mar 2012]. This person suffered a mild illness, and has recovered and been discharged from hospital. Currently, there is insufficient information available to allow a conclusive assessment of the mode and source of transmission.

To date, the WHO has been informed of a global total of 16 confirmed cases of human infection with nCoV, including 9 deaths [see below newswire in section [3] reporting a 10th death - Mod.MPP].

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States (MS) to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns. The WHO is currently working with international experts and countries where cases have been reported to assess the situation and review recommendations for surveillance and monitoring.

All MS are reminded to promptly assess and notify the WHO of any new case of infection with nCoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course.

The WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

The WHO continues to closely monitor the situation.

[2] Saudi Arabia - new case

The World Health Organization says there has been another infection with the new coronavirus, this time in someone who was a contact of an earlier case. But the Geneva-based global health agency says it doesn't have enough information to estimate whether the new infection was the result of person-to-person spread. The case is from Saudi Arabia, the 9th from that country.

Globally there have now been 16 confirmed infections from the new virus -- which is from the same family as SARS -- with at least 9 deaths.

The WHO statement says the newest case was a contact of a 39-year-old Saudi man who died from the infection on [2 Mar 2013]. The newest case is a person who had mild illness only; the person has recovered and has been released from hospital. The WHO says currently it doesn't know enough to gauge whether the new case was infected by the 39-year-old man, or contracted the virus from the same source as he did. In fact, it appears that the WHO may know very little about the new case.

The press release from the agency does not reveal the individual's gender or age. Nor does it say when the person fell ill, was hospitalized and released from hospital.

WHO press releases announcing infections with the new coronavirus -- which it calls NCoV -- generally contain those kinds of details when the health agency has them.

If it turns out this is a case of person-to-person spread, it would not be the 1st time that has been seen. There have been at least 3 instances where human-to-human spread is suspected, and in one of those cases it is assumed to have happened. That instance involved a cluster of cases in Britain, started by a man who returned home ill after a trip to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The man's son, who had cancer, became infected and died. Another member of their extended family was infected, but she had only mild illness. As the son and the 3rd case in that cluster had not travelled outside Britain before becoming ill, it is believed they contracted the virus from the man who had travelled.

A British newspaper, the Birmingham Mail, reported Saturday [23 Mar 2013] that the 1st case in that cluster succumbed to his illness this week. But the WHO's statement Saturday [23 Mar 2013] does not reflect an additional death caused by the coronavirus.

The new virus was 1st spotted last June [2012] after a man from the Saudi capital, Riyadh, died from an infection for which a cause could not initially be discovered.

Subsequently it was recognized that earlier cases had occurred in Jordan, where 11 people fell ill last April [2012] in a cluster of mysterious infections in a hospital. Stored samples from the 2 fatal cases in that cluster later revealed they had been infected with the coronavirus.

When a blood test to determine past infection becomes available, it may be possible to determine if others in that cluster were also infected. But to date laboratories working to develop a blood test that picks up these cases has proved difficult to develop.

To date 4 countries have recorded infections: Saudi Arabia, with 9 cases and 6 deaths; Qatar, with 2 cases; Britain, with 3 cases and one (or 2) deaths; and Jordan, with 2 fatal cases.

Birmingham grandad is UK's 2nd Coronavirus victim
-------------------
[The Birmingham resident], of Winson Green, lost a battle against a SARS-like bug in hospital on Tuesday [19 Mar 2013]. [The Birmingham resident] has become the UK's 2nd victim to the new SARS-like bug Coronavirus. The tragedy comes as his wife and daughter were in Pakistan after burying his [38-year-old son], who had also fallen victim to the killer disease.

The dad-of-2, in his 60s, of Winson Green, was being treated at Wythenshawe Hospital, in Manchester, and seemed to be improving. But he took a turn for the worse and lost his battle on Tuesday [19 Mar 2013]. His funeral was held at a mosque in Small Heath, on Wednesday [20 Mar 2013] and his body has now been taken to Pakistan for burial.

[The 60 year old man] had contracted the disease after a trip to Saudi Arabia with his daughter. He complained of a temperature and chest problems upon his return at the end of January [2013] and within a few days he was admitted to City Hospital, in Birmingham.

It's thought during this period that his [38-year-old] son, dad-of-2, suffering from cancer, picked up the bug from his father. [The son] was undergoing chemotherapy at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Edgbaston. He continued to be treated there for both conditions and died on [17 Feb 2013].

The 1st patients infected with the coronavirus fell ill in Jordan, Qatar and Saudi Arabia last year [2012], but the source of the infection remains unknown, despite missions by the World Health Organisation and other international groups. As with SARS, the virus has most likely jumped from bats into other animals, in this case perhaps goats or other livestock, which have gone on to infect humans.

It has infected at least 15 people since it emerged in the Middle East last year [2013] - more than half of whom have died of pneumonia and multiple organ failure, symptoms that were common in SARS patients.

A Wythenshawe Hospital spokesman confirmed [that the patient] had died on Tuesday [19 Mar 2013].

[As stated above, the total number of confirmed cases of illness associated with infection with the novel coronavirus (nCoV) is now 16, of which 10 had a fatal outcome, a case fatality rate (CFR) of 62.5 per cent. As mentioned in an earlier report, the total number of confirmed cases to date is small (16), the observed CFR of 62.5 may be a reflection of non-confirmation of milder illness associated with infection with this nCoV. The newswire in [3] seems to confirm the report of the death of the index case in the UK cluster of nCoV infections. As a reminder, the index case had a history of travel to Pakistan and Saudi Arabia during the incubation period for nCoV infection.

The breakdown of cases (and deaths) by country of report is:
- Saudi Arabia: 9 (6 deaths)
- Jordan: 2 (2 deaths)
- UK: 4 (1 patient from Qatar -- under treatment, 3 patients from UK -- one with history of travel to Saudi Arabia and Pakistan prior to illness; one recovered, 2 deaths)
- Germany: one (patient from Qatar -- discharged).

As mentioned in the newswire in report [2] above, at present, retrospective identification of cases with milder clinical illness infected with this nCoV has not been successful to date. One suspects that the report of the cluster of ICU staff in Jordan did have more cases than were confirmed, but in the absence of laboratory confirmation it is difficult to definitively state they were infected with the nCoV.

The absence of more information on the newly reported case in Saudi Arabia makes any interpretation/discussion of the possible route of transmission difficult at this time. This moderator attempted a search of the Arabic language media [using an online translation tool] to see if there were any local reports on this case that might shed more information. Unfortunately the only articles found were summaries of the current WHO announcement. More information from knowledgeable sources in the region would be greatly appreciated.
