[The European Commission's Animal Health and Welfare Directorate http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/avian/ notes that for HPAI events in EU Member States (updated in August 2015), the following subtypes have been identified: "In July 2015 HPAI of the subtype H7N7 was detected in poultry holdings in the United Kingdom and in Germany. From November 2014 to February 2015 HPAI of the subtype H5N8 was detected in poultry, captive and wild birds in Germany, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Italy and in Hungary. In March 2015 HPAI of the subtype H5N1 (the 'Asian strain') was detected in poultry and wild birds in Bulgaria, while in Romania this virus was found in wild birds only". [Note: To this information we can now add the recent event reported in November 2015 by France, where HPAI of the subtype H5N1 was identified; see 20151125.3819479.- Mod.CRD]

While H5N2 had been previously identified in EU Member States, those cases were associated with a low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 strain. (See reports below). This, therefore, is the 1st report of an H5N2 highly pathogenic subtype in an EU Member State.

Avian influenza viruses are divided by subtype based on 2 proteins found in the viruses: a hemagglutinin, or "H" protein, and a neuraminidase, or "N" protein. There are 16 H types and 9 N types, yielding a total 144 possible combinations.

The H5 and H7 subtypes are of particular concern, because of their ability to mutate from low-pathogenic to highly pathogenic strains. These 2 H-types have been known to cause serious disease and mortality in domestic poultry, and are commonly isolated from wild waterfowl (http://www.inspection.gc.ca/animals/terrestrial-animals/diseases/reportable/ai/fact-sheet/eng/1356193731667/1356193918453).- Mod.CRD
