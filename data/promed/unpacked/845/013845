[Botulism
(http://www.epi.hss.state.ak.us/pubs/botulism/bot_03.htm), or
sausage poisoning as it was originally termed, was first seriously
studied following an outbreak in Wildbad, Germany in 1793. The
outbreak involved 13 people, 6 of whom died, and was associated with
consumption of a locally produced blood sausage. Following this
outbreak, the number of reported cases of sausage poisoning rapidly
increased, prompting a study of the disease by local health officer
Justinius Kerner (1829). He described 230 cases, most of which were
attributed to the consumption of sausage. The illness became known as
"botulism" after "botulus", the Latin word for sausage. - Mod.LL]
