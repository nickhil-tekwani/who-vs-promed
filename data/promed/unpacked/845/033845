Headlines
- The World Health Assembly (WHA) is meeting this week in Geneva, Switzerland. Ministers of Health and public health professionals from around the world are discussing global public health issues, including the global drive to eradicate polio. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) secretariat has prepared a status report, which will inform the discussions by Member States.
- The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) welcomes Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the new Director-General-elect of the World Health Organization, and looks forward to working with him to achieve a polio-free world.
- Two separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, one in Haut Lomami province and one in Maniema.
- Health Ministers of the Group of Twenty have emphasized the importance of polio eradication and transition planning efforts at their inaugural meeting in Berlin, Germany.
- Polio staff in Nigeria have contributed emergency response expertise to a meningitis outbreak in Sokoto State.
- Summary of newly-reported viruses this week [week of Sun 21 May 2017]: Afghanistan, 1 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) environmental sample. Pakistan, 7 new WPV1 environmental samples. Democratic Republic of the Congo, 4 new cases of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) and one isolate from a healthy individual in the community.

Afghanistan
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week [week of Sun 14 May 2017]. The total number of cases for 2017 remains 3, and for 2016 remains 13. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 February [2017], from Kunduz province.
- One new environmental sample positive for WPV1 was reported in the past week [week of Sun 14 May 2017] in Lashkargah district, Hilmand province, with date of collection on 26 April [2017].
- With most of Afghanistan polio-free, efforts are focused on continuing to strengthen operations, in close coordination with Pakistan, to address remaining low-level transmission in the common reservoir area of the Quetta-Kandahar corridor.

Pakistan
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week [week of Sun 14 May 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2017 remains 2, and for 2016 remains 20. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 13 February 2017, from Diamir district, Gilgit Baltistan.
- A total of 7 new positive WPV1 environmental samples were reported in the past week [week of Sun 14 May 2017]; 3 in Balochistan province, with 2 in Quetta district and one in Killa Abdullah; 2 in Rawalpindi district, Punjab province; one in Sukkur district, Sindh province; and one in CDA, Islamabad. Dates of collection were between 10 April 2017 and 10 May 2017.
- The year 2016 saw the lowest ever annual number of polio cases in the country but poliovirus continues to be isolated through environmental surveillance over a significant geographical range. Efforts are ongoing through implementation of the national emergency action plan to address remaining gaps in coverage and surveillance, in close coordination with neighbouring Afghanistan.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week [week of Sun 14 May 2017]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4 and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 21 August 2016 in Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country.
- The response is part of a broader regional outbreak response, coordinated with neighbouring countries, in particular the Lake Chad sub-region, including northern Cameroon, parts of Central African Republic, Chad and southern Niger.
- Detection of the polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission and the urgent need to strengthen subnational surveillance.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria poses a risk to the neighboring countries of the Lake Chad basin and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.

Central Africa
- A total of 2 separate outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
- In Haut Lomami province, 2 cases of cVDPV2 have been reported, one in Butumba district with onset of paralysis on 8 March 2017 and one in Malemba-Nkulu district on 20 February 2017.
- In Maniema province, 2 cases of cVDPV2 have been reported, one in Kindu district with onset of paralysis on 26 March 2017 and one in Kunda district on 18 April 2017. One additional isolate has been detected in a healthy individual from the community in Kindu district, with the sample collected on 2 May 2017.
- Outbreak response plans are currently being finalized, with supplementary immunization activities using monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. Surveillance and immunization activities are being strengthened in neighboring countries.
- The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also affected by an Ebola outbreak, in Bas Uele province in the north of the country. Coordination among both outbreak response teams will be necessary and teams are already working on this.

[This update confirms that the vaccine derived poliovirus (VDPV) responsible for cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) reported in our last polio update (see Poliomyelitis update (07): Mozambique, Congo DR, VDPV, RFI 20170525.5060299) was due to a circulating VDPV (cVDPV). The last identification of a cVDPV in the DRC was during the period 2008 to 2012, when there were a total of 64 cases of cVDPV associated polio (http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/circulating-vaccine-derived-poliovirus/). The outbreaks of the cVDPV involve 2 provinces in the eastern part of the country - Maniema and Haut Lomami and can be found on a map at: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2015/06/04/the-democratic-republic-of-congo-might-break-up-its-provinces-then-what/?utm_term=.44396e4179ab.

It will be interesting to see the results of the genetic sequencing of the involved viruses to see which, if any, are most closely associated with those viruses last identified (geographically), as an obvious question is whether these are related viruses (in the 2 provinces) as well as if they might have been circulating "silently" since 2012. - Mod.MPP
