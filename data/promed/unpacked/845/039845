From: "Stephen A. Berger, M.D." <mberger@post.tau.ac.il>

The following background information on cryptosporidiosis in New
Zealand was extracted from the GIDEON software program:
There appear to be two peaks in the incidence of cryptosporidiosis
in New Zealand. Spring peaks occur in rural areas and are
ascribed to the presence of calves and lambs [spread in their
feces - Mod.JW. A summer peak has been observed in
Wellington and Hutt, possibly related to swimming pool activity.
Four cases were reported in December 1996 (first month of
reporting). 357 cases were reported in 1997; 867 in 1998
(24.0/100 000).
The country's first outbreak was reported in 1998: 122 cases from
a swimming pool in Hutt Valley.
