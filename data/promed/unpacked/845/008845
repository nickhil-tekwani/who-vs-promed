The Central District Health Department is warning heathcare providers in Ada County to be on alert for a rise in whooping cough cases.

Health care officials say whooping cough cases, also known as pertussis, have increased in recent months compared to case loads last year [2016]. In the last 3 months, 14 pertussis cases were reported in Ada County. That's twice the number compared to the same time last year [2016].

Most cases are in kids and young adults between 13 and 20-years-old, and one-quarter are older than 40. Some people had been vaccinated against pertussis and showed a milder cough than the traditional "whoop" so many recognize. That's why health care providers are urged to test all instances of a cough, according to a news release from St. Luke's.

The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology says the number of cases is on the rise. Two thousand and twelve saw a peak with more than 48 000 reported cases. In 2015, nearly 21 000 cases of pertussis were reported. While that's a decrease compared to 2014, annual case numbers are still significantly higher.

[APIC] says there are many factors that may account for the rise in pertussis cases: Not all babies get the vaccination to protect them; Protection against whooping cough decreases over time, and teens and adults can become infected repeatedly; and pertussis rates among adults have risen 400 percent since 1990.

Up to 7 schools in Champaign County [Illinois] have confirmed whooping cough cases, with a total of 40 cases so far. The Champaign-Urbana Public Health District confirmed 40 cases of pertussis, 27 of which have been confirmed since mid-October [2017]. Rantoul High School has 20 confirmed cases alone, according to the News-Gazette. The latest confirmed cases involve 2 students in Mahomet, Illinois: A 3rd-grader and 7th-grader have each come down with pertussis, a contagious bacterial disease that can take weeks for recovery. Treatment is a 5-day course of antibiotics, which is often delayed since pertussis starts with symptoms similar to the common cold. Last year [2016] Champaign County saw only 7 cases.

Henderson County Public Schools confirmed [that] 8 students have tested positive for whooping cough at 5 schools. Health officials say they expect more people to come down with the illness before the outbreak is over. "We're expecting to have more cases and at some point that will die down," said Dr. Diana Curran, Medical Director for Henderson County Department of Public Health.

Molly McGowan Gorsuch, a spokesperson for the school district, said the students who tested positive for pertussis attend Hillandale Elementary, Clear Creek Elementary, Bruce Drysdale Elementary, Rugby Middle, and East Henderson High schools.

An outbreak of whooping cough on the state's [New South Wales or NSW] north coast has many parents of sick children infuriated with anti-vaxxers. At least 40 cases have been reported in the past 28 days -- the majority among primary school children living around Murwillumbah and Tweed Heads.

Childhood vaccination rates in the northern NSW local health district are as low as 50 percent in some areas. Northern NSW Public Health Unit acting director Greg Bell said in the past 7 days alone 13 cases of whooping cough were confirmed, and that those represent only a portion of the potentially fatal disease in the community.

Royal Oak Middle School and Prospect Lake Elementary are the latest schools to have a confirmed case of whooping cough. It brings the total number of cases on south Vancouver Island to 107. That's a spike from 79 cases for all of 2016. There were 213 cases in 2015 and 47 in 2014.

In September [2017], 5 schools -- Lansdowne, Central and Shoreline middle schools, as well as Craigflower and Cloverdale elementary schools -- had confirmed or suspected cases of whooping cough. An independent school also had a case.

Pertussis vaccinations are recommended for children at 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 18 months, in kindergarten and then in Grade 9. The B.C. [British Columbia] Centre for Disease Control reported that last year [2016], 76 percent of 2-year-olds had up-to-date immunizations in Island Health's south Island area. Adults are advised to get a booster shot.
