For the 1st time, Belgium has reported a week without new cases of African swine fever (ASF) in its wild boar population. That was shown in the latest report to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).

Ever since mid-May [2019] the total number of infected animals had been relatively low. Over the whole of June [2019], only 8 infected wild boar were found in Belgium's province of Luxembourg -- the lowest monthly score since the virus was discovered in September 2018. The total number of infected wild boar therefore remains 824. In total, 799 were found dead in the forest; an additional 25 [were] shot dead.

About 2 weeks ago, there also was a moment when there was no news about ASF from Belgium. That was caused by the fact that there was no update on the situation in Belgium reported to the OIE. Due to the presence of the virus, however, Belgium has to give updates, irrespective of new cases being found or not. There was an update about last week -- and that one, for the 1st time, was "empty."

Belgium recently announced it started shooting the remaining wild boar in the inner zone of the infected area. In doing so, Belgium follows EU policy to keep the virus concentrated in one zone as much as possible. As soon as the virus makes fewer victims, the remaining population in that zone will be shot dead by trained professionals, to prevent that ASF virus can find any hosts.

A similar approach proved to be successful in the Czech Republic, where the virus, just like in Belgium, was found only in the wild boar population. In total, in the Czech Republic, 230 wild boar died of ASF in Zlin province between June 2017 and April 2018. On 28 Feb 2019, the European Commission declared the Czech Republic to be free from ASF again. In doing so, the Czechs have been the only country in recent years to have done so.

If things would stay like this, then February [2019] has been the worst month for Belgium with in total 217 infected animals, followed by October [2018] (139) and January [2019] (121). Most animals were found in the community Tintigny (223), followed by Meix-devant-Virton (192) and Etalle (129). The virus never entered any domestic pig farms and also never entered France, Luxembourg (the country) or Germany.

[The Belgian delegation to the EU's last meeting of the EU's PAFF Committee, held in Brussels during 8-9 Jul 2019, presented a PowerPoint presentation (14 slides, with 5 maps) titled "African swine fever in wild boar in Belgium." The presentation, prepared by Belgium's Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain, includes updated detailed information on the epidemiology of the disease and the control measures applied, including fencing. The presentation is available at https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/reg-com_ahw_20190708_asf_bel.pdf (thanks to Sabine Zentis).

In bordering Luxembourg, a wild boar hunting operation was carried out by 150 hunters and "beaters" during 4 and 5 Jul 2019 in the "white zone" along the Belgian border (for the technique applied, see item 2 in 20190703.6550504). This hunt received logistic support from the Veterinary Services Administration, the Forest and Nature Administration, the State Roads Administration, the Army and the Kaerjeng Commune. It reportedly unrolled without disturbances. During the 2 days of the hunt, 7 wild boars were shot and 2 corpses of wild boars were discovered. All were submitted to the lab for ASF testing. The analyses of the 7 shot boars were found negative; of the 2 cadavers, one tested negative and the other was found unfit for testing (press release dated 9 Jul 2019, in French, available at https://ma.gouvernement.lu/fr/actualites.gouvernement+fr+actualites+toutes_actualites+communiques+2019+07-juillet+09-schneider-sangliers.html).

To date, of the 226 ASF tests conducted at Luxembourg's State Veterinary Medicine Laboratory (LMVE) on wild boar carcasses, all results have been negative. For each boar shot, a health allowance of EUR 100 (USD 112.50) will be paid by the Ministry of Agriculture. - Mod.AS
