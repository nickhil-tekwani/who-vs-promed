An influenza outbreak at a state prison has sickened more than 500
prisoners since last month [February 2008], forcing the facility to
bar new inmates and visitors, officials said Friday [7 Mar 2008].
Inmates at Chuckawalla Valley State Prison began experiencing
flu-like symptoms on 23 Feb 2008, said prison administrative
assistant Lt. Debbie Asuncion. The symptoms include fever, cough and
body aches.

Asuncion said 546 inmates have become ill, and 10 of them were
hospitalized. Two inmates died, and those deaths were being
investigated to determine if they were related to influenza, Asuncion
said. Eight remained hospitalized, and the rest were being treated at
the prison.

The prison was closed to all visitors, including attorneys and
volunteers, to keep the public from being exposed. The prison also
was not receiving or transferring inmates and was restricting inmate
movement within the prison, Asuncion said. Chuckawalla Valley State
prison is a low-to-medium-security prison that currently houses 3147
inmates, Asuncion said.

[The high attack rate in this outbreak (546 persons among 3147
inmates) since 23 Feb 2008 is probably a reflection of population
density. It also suggests that availability and/or uptake of the
current seasonal influenza vaccine has been unsatisfactory.

According to the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) for 15 Feb 2008
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm57e215a1.htm>,
influenza activity since the beginning of the 2007-2008 influenza
season remained low in the United States. Activity increased from
early December 2007 through the end of the year and has continued to
increase in January and February 2008.

This season [2007-2008], more influenza A viruses than influenza B
viruses have been identified in all regions. Among influenza A
viruses, influenza A (H1N1) has predominated in the New England,
Mid-Atlantic, West North Central, Mountain, and Pacific regions, and
influenza A (H3N2) has predominated in the East North Central, South
Atlantic, East South Central, and West South Central regions. This
season, laboratory-confirmed influenza has been reported by the
District of Columbia and 47 states from all 9 surveillance regions.

Since 1977, influenza A (H1N1), influenza A (H3N2), and influenza B
viruses have circulated globally. Each year's influenza vaccine
contains a virus representing each of these 3 distinct influenza
virus groups. The 3 viruses selected to be included in this season's
[2007-2008] vaccine were selected in February 2007 as the viruses
that appeared most likely to be circulating during this influenza
season. The degree of antigenic match between current influenza
vaccine strains and the influenza viruses that are circulating this
season will continue to be assessed as more viruses become available
for analysis. To date, 91 percent of influenza A (H1N1) viruses sent
to CDC for antigenic characterization were similar to A/Solomon
Islands/3/2006, the influenza A (H1N1) component of the 2007-2008
influenza vaccine. Although the majority of influenza A (H3N2) and
influenza B viruses are not optimally matched, vaccination with the
trivalent influenza vaccine continues to be recommended because the
vaccine can provide partial protection against related strains and
reduce the risk for influenza-related complications and deaths. In
addition, the vaccine contains 3 strains, and communities can
experience outbreaks with more than one strain of influenza in a
given year.
