Investigations of West Nile Virus Infections in Recipients of Blood
Transfusions
--------------------------
CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Health Resources and
Services Administration (HRSA), in collaboration with blood collection
agencies and state and local health departments, continue to investigate
West Nile virus (WNV) infections in recipients of blood transfusions.
During 28 Aug ­26 Oct 2002, CDC received reports of 47 persons with
possible transfusion-related WNV infection. Investigations showed that 14
of these persons either did not have WNV infection or did not acquire WNV
infection through transfusion. The remaining 33 cases, reported from 17
states, occurred among persons who had confirmed or probable WNV infection
and had received blood components in the month before illness onset. To
date, evidence that WNV can be transmitted through blood transfusion has
been found in 6 of the 33 cases; investigations are ongoing for the other
27 cases.
Among the 6 cases with evidence that WNV can be transmitted through blood
transfusion, 3 have been previously summarized (1,2); 2 developed confirmed
West Nile virus meningoencephalitis (WNME) after receiving different blood
components derived from the same blood donation, which was subsequently
found to have evidence of WNV (2). In follow-up testing, the donor
associated with these components had WNV-specific IgM antibody. On
interview, this donor reported having a fever and a rash 2 and 5 days after
donation, respectively. In a third case, WNV was isolated from an
untransfused unit of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) derived from the suspected
donation, indicating that the virus can survive in some blood components
(1). The donor of this unit sought medical care 4 days after donation for
an illness of 1­2 weeks duration characterized by nasal congestion, sinus
pain, headache, malaise, and fatigue, and was treated for sinusitis. On
follow-up, the donor tested positive for WNV-specific IgM antibody.
Investigations of 3 additional patients found evidence that these persons
acquired WNV infection by transfusion. An adolescent with a hematologic
malignancy who had been hospitalized continuously for 65 days developed
WNME after receiving 93 blood components in the month before illness onset.
Of 72 retention segments (blood samples from tubing that had been attached
to the original donor collection bag or from the packed red blood cell
component prepared from the whole blood collection) available from these
donations, one tested positive for WNV by kinetic quantitative polymerase
chain reaction assay (Taqman®) and negative for WNV-specific IgM antibody.
The donor of the unit associated with the Taqman®-positive retention
segment reported fever, chills, headache, painful eyes, and generalized
weakness beginning 2 days after donation in early September and
subsequently developed WNV IgM antibody.
There were 2 additional patients who had WNME diagnosed after each had
received a component derived from the same blood donation. The first
patient, a man aged 60 years with a malignancy, received 4 units of red
blood cells during 18­30 Sep 2002, and subsequently developed encephalitis.
Serum and cerebrospinal fluid samples tested positive for WNV-specific IgM
antibody on 8 and 16 Oct 2002, respectively; the patient subsequently died.
One of 4 retention segments associated with the units the patient received
tested positive for WNV by Taqman® and negative for WNV-specific IgM
antibody. A unit of FFP associated with this Taqman®-positive donation had
been administered on 6 Oct 2002 to the second patient, a woman aged 40
years with a malignancy; 3 days later, this patient had fever. Serum
collected from the patient 1 day before transfusion was negative for WNV by
Taqman® and WNV-specific IgM antibody. Serum collected from the patient 9
days after transfusion tested positive for WNV by reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction and negative for WNV-specific IgM antibody; serum
collected 6 days later tested positive for WNV by Taqman® and positive for
WNV-specific IgM antibody. The donor of the Taqman®-positive unit
subsequently developed WNV IgM antibody. During follow-up interview, the
donor reported having fever, chills, headache, eye pain, and myalgias 5
days before donation and a rash 4 days after donation in late August 2002.
Cases of WNV infection in patients who have received blood transfusions
within the month preceding illness onset should be reported to CDC through
state and local public health authorities. Serum or tissue samples should
be retained for later studies. In addition, cases of WNV infection
occurring in persons who have illness onset within 2 weeks after blood
donation should be reported. Prompt reporting of these cases will
facilitate withdrawal of potentially infectious blood components.
FDA has issued a guidance document for deferral of donors with suspect or
diagnosed WNV infection who have illness onset before or after donation
(3). In addition, the document provides recommendations for retrieval and
quarantine of blood and blood components in such donors. FDA, in
collaboration with CDC, the National Institutes of Health, and HRSA, is
sponsoring a workshop on development of donor-screening assays for WNV.
