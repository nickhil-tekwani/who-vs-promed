New Foot and Mouth Cases Detected
------------------------
New cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) have been detected in parts
of Mberengwa, Zvishavane, Gutu and Buhera.
The principal director of the Department of Veterinary Services, Dr
Stuart Hargreaves, said yesterday that the new cases, detected early
this week, were a result of illegal movement of livestock.
"There is a lot of illegal movement of livestock particularly during
this time of the year in communal areas. Some farmers are not heeding
our advice of seeking approval from our department before moving
livestock from one area to the other."
About a month ago, the department suspended the movement of livestock
in Chivi and Gutu districts following an outbreak of the disease. The
department was in the process of vaccinating livestock in the
affected areas.
"We have some stocks of FMD vaccines but we definitely need more
because of the magnitude of the problem since we need to build our
reserves."
The department had struck a deal with the Botswana Vaccine Institute
for the supply of at least one million doses of the vaccine a
month.The supply of additional vaccines from Botswana was however
being hampered by the shortage of foreign currency.
The latest outbreak of foot and mouth follows another outbreak at 2
farms in an export zone south of Harare in August 2003. Dr Hargreaves
said the outbreak had been isolated and contained while more than 71
000 cattle had been vaccinated in the Mashonaland provinces.
The long-term solution of eradicating the disease was to carry out a
national vaccination campaign.
