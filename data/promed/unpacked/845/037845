Columbia County issues rabies alert after 2 dogs attacked
---------------------------------------------------------
Columbia County [New York] Health Department officials have issued a
rabies alert after a grey fox attacked 2 dogs in the Malden Bridge
area. The fox has not been captured. The state Department of
Environmental Conservation began searching for the animal on [Wed 28
Apr 2010] in the area of Shaker Museum Road where last sighted.

Both dogs were current with their rabies vaccinations, and were
administered booster shots as per protocol by their veterinarian.

The health department reminds Columbia County residents to use
precaution if an animal is behaving abnormally, is unusually
aggressive or friendly. Stay clear and call an animal control
professional, they said.

If you are bitten by an animal, make every effort to locate the
animal and have it captured for testing. If the animal cannot be
captured, the bitten person should seek immediate medical attention.

The health department said exposure of an actual bite to high rabies
risk animals, such as raccoons, bats, skunks, and foxes also requires
immediate medical attention. Any potential exposure should be
reported to the health department at 1-518-828-3358.

Columbia County residents can also limit their exposure by keeping
their pets properly vaccinated, the county said.

3rd case of rabies reported
---------------------------
The Animal Control Division of the Carteret County [North Carolina]
Health Department is reminding the public of the importance of the
rabies vaccine for their pets following the 3rd reported case of
rabies in the county this year [2010].

Animal Control officers reported Tuesday [27 Apr 2010] that a fox
that attacked a dog last week has tested positive for rabies. Last
Friday [23 Apr 2010] evening in a Morehead City neighborhood, the
rabid fox jumped a 4-foot [1.3 m] fence into a yard to attack a dog.
The homeowner killed the fox by beating it with a pipe, according to
a health department news release.

The dog suffered some injuries and was seen by a veterinarian on
Monday [16 Apr 2010]. The dog was up-to-date on its rabies
vaccination and also received its required rabies booster shot. If
the dog had not received the booster within 5 days, the owner would
have had to isolate the dog for 6 months or have the animal
euthanized, officials said.

Dogs and cats need their 1st rabies vaccine at 4 months of age and a
rabies booster at 1 year. Rabies vaccine is then an annual shot. It
takes 21 days for the 1st rabies shot to protect; follow-up shots
protect immediately.

Contact your veterinarian for more information about rabies, or
contact Carteret County Health Department Animal Control at
252-728-8585.

Middleboro veterinarian confirms case of rabies in horse
--------------------------------------------------------
State officials says rabies remains a low-level, constant threat to humans.

For the 1st time in his 34 years of practice, local veterinarian
Bruce Chase has diagnosed a case of rabies in a horse. The viral
disease is common in dogs, cats, and other predators but is rare in
non-predatory animals such as horses. In Massachusetts, Chase said
only 3 cases have been confirmed in the past 10 years.

Chase said he has notified his clients in the area that the risk of
rabies may be higher this year [2010]. "We still consider rabies a
big part of public health concern," Chase said.

The horse in question lived on a property in Freetown and had not
been vaccinated. Chase tested it after seeing that it was acting
uncharacteristically. The horse has been euthanized.

Freetown interim town administrator John F Healey said the town's new
animal inspector will work to improve barn inspections and ensure
that horses have up-to-date inoculations.

The state Department of Public Health investigated the case,
diagnosed 3 Apr 2010. Officials concluded that it "does not suggest
any elevated risk in the area," DPH spokeswoman Jennifer Manley said
in an e-mail to The Enterprise. "Rabies remains a low level but
constant threat to all pets, livestock, and people in Massachusetts,"
she said.

The horse, she said, had been exposed to a rabid skunk.

Rabies is most often transmitted through the bite or scratch of a
rabid animal. The disease infects the central nervous system, causing
encephalitis and ultimately death.

Vaccination has drastically decreased the number of rabies cases in
domestic animals since an outbreak in 1992. It is still prevalent in
wild animals such as raccoons, skunks, bats, and woodchucks.

2nd rabid raccoon in one week
-----------------------------
Greenbrier County Thursday [29 Apr 2010] reported a 2nd raccoon
discovered in a White Sulphur Springs business area tested positive
for the virus at the West Virginia State Hygienic lab.

Ronceverte reported a rabid raccoon last Friday [23 Apr 2010]. This
marks the 7th animal to have tested positive for the virus in the
county this year [2010] -- the same number reported by this date in
2009.

Measures are being taken to combat the rabies problem. The Greenbrier
County Commission contracted the USDA Wildlife Service in order to
work on projects to improve public education on rabies, in hopes of
lowering the incidence of the disease in small terrestrial mammals in
the county, officials said. The proposed activities are projected to
take a minimum of 2 years.

The county's health department urges people to avoid wild animals and
to remember to vaccinate domestic animals to reduce the risk of
transmission of rabies to humans.

If exposure to a rabid animals occurs, officials say to report
immediately to a physician as well as the local health department.

[Rabies is a viral disease that can infect any mammal. While it may
not be prevalent in some animals, nevertheless, mammals are
susceptible to the virus.

It is critical for animal owners to vaccinate their pets, whether it
is a cat, dog, horse, or a cow. This is needed protection for your
pet and for your own protection.

Each of these areas should be setting up rabies drives to help insure
that more pets are vaccinated. - Mod.TG]
