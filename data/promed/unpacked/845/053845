hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). According to the Ministry, on 29 Apr 2007 a
24-year old inhabitant of the settlement of Amangeldy in the
Syr-Darya district was admitted to the regional infectious diseases
hospital on suspicion of a severe form of CCHF. On 30 Apr 2007, a
team of physicians confirmed the diagnosis. The condition of the
patient has now deteriorated. [Tick control measures] are being

[2] CCHF in Astrakhan

The 1st cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been
observed in the Astrakhan region. On 3 May 2007, according to
Astrakhan Radio, residents of the village of Colenoye Zaymische in
the Chernojarskiy district were admitted to hospital with
characteristic symptoms of CCHF: i.e. an acute fever, symptoms of
intoxication, and severe hemorrhagic symptoms.
Ticks are the source of the infection. 16 cases of CCHF were recorded
last year [2006], including one fatality. According to
Rospotrebnadzor [the Federal Service for Surveillance of Consumer
Rights and Human Welfare - Mod.NP], favorable weather conditions
contributed to a marked increase in the density of the tick
population. This is something the inhabitants of the region should be
aware of. Most at risk are those employed in the cattle rearing
industry. Appropriate clothing covering exposed skin should be worn
to prevent exposure to tick bites. Periodic inspection for tick bites
is advisable, and medical attention should be sought immediately at a
local polyclinic when tick bites are detected.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a
tick-borne virus belonging to the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family
_Bunyaviridae_. The disease was 1st characterized in the Crimea in
1944 and given the name Crimean hemorrhagic fever. It was then later
recognized in 1969 as the cause of illness in the Congo, thus
resulting in the current name of the disease. Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is found in Eastern Europe, particularly in
Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union. It is also
distributed throughout the Mediterranean, in northwestern China,
central Asia, southern Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the
Indian subcontinent.
Ixodid (hard) ticks, especially those of the genus, _Hyalomma_, are
both a reservoir and a vector for CCHF virus. Numerous wild and
domestic animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep and hares, serve as
amplifying hosts for the virus. Transmission to humans occurs through
contact with infected animal blood or ticks. CCHF can be transmitted
from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood
or body fluids. Documented spread of CCHF has also occurred in
hospitals due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, re-use
of injection needles, and contamination of medical supplies.

[The Astrakhan region is a part of the Southern federal district of
Russia. The Astrakhan region is located in the extreme southeast of
the European part of Russia. It borders the Republic of Kazakhstan,
the Republic of Turkmenistan, and the Islamic Republic of Iran.
Within the Russian Federation, the Astrakhan region borders the
Volgograd region and Republic of Kalmykia.
The Southern Federal District (SFD) is one of 7 federal
administrative districts in Russia. It is located in the far
southwest and includes the Rostov, Krasnodar, Stavropol, Volgograd,
and Astrakhan regions, and also the Republics of Chechnya, Kalmykia,
Dagestan, Adygeya, Severhaya Osetiya, Kabardino-Balkaria,
Ingushetiya, and Karachaevo-Cherkessiya. The SFD is an endemic region
for CCHF. Last year (2006), above 200 cases of CCHF were registered
there. Due to anomalous warm weather that allowed the tick population
to survive, the prognosis for the current year (2007) is unfavorable. - Mod.NP]
