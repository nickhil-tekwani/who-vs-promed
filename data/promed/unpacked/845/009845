The social mobilization team of the Kipamba health zone in Bukama territory claims to have listed, in 6 weeks, 59 cases of yellow fever in this part of Katanga. According to this [radio] service, this disease affects at least 10 localities.

Prevention is by vaccination. A vaccine was introduced in DRC in 2003 as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Vaccinations for children are generally given from 0-59 months, but if there is an epidemic, we can vaccinate them up to 15 years [9 months? For YF. - Mod.JW].

The doctor for the Kipamba area invites the public to clean up places where they live to protect themselves against the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito that is the vector of this disease . He also announced there would soon be a vaccination campaign against yellow fever in this health area.

[Yellow fever occurs sporadically in rural areas of the DRC. With a total of 59 reported yellow fever virus infections in 10 localities in the Kipamba health zone, there is real cause for concern. This report does not indicate whether these cases have been laboratory confirmed. One hopes that the vaccination campaign scheduled to begin soon will bring a halt to transmission. Without a vigorous public education campaign in the affected localities, vector mosquito control through a cleanup campaign is not likely to be successful.
