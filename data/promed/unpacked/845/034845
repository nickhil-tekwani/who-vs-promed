[The report above serves as an official confirmation of the already suspected nosocomial outbreak continuing in Riyadh. Of the 17 cases reported in this update, all but 3 had identifiable risk factors for exposure (cases 2, 10, and 11 did not have identifiable risk factors for exposure), either probable nosocomial transmission, zoonotic transmission, or direct contact with other confirmed cases. It is not clear how many hospitals may be involved in this ongoing outbreak, or how many of the above mentioned contacts with other confirmed cases occurred outside of the healthcare environment. - Mod.MPP]
