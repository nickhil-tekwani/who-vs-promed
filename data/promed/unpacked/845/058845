New data presented at the European Association of Urology congress this week show that men with low testosterone who were hospitalized for severe COVID-19 during the 1st wave of infections in Milan, Italy, were more likely to need intensive care and mechanical ventilation, and they had a 6-fold increased risk of death.

The findings come from San Raffaele University Hospital in Milan, where researchers compared 286 male COVID-19 patients who presented for emergency care, with 305 healthy controls who donated blood at the hospital from February to May 2020. Both groups had hormone testing, and low testosterone was defined as 9.2 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L).

Ninety percent of the males with severe COVID-19 had low testosterone, compared with 17% of controls. And men with severe COVID-19 had very low levels of the male sex hormone: Those admitted to intensive care or who died had just 0.7 to 1.0 nmol/L, and those with milder disease also had low levels (3 to 4 nmol/L).

"We never expected to see such a high proportion of COVID patients with these extremely low levels of testosterone, in comparison to a similar group of healthy men. The relationship is very clear: the lower the testosterone, the higher the severity of the condition and likelihood of death," said Andrea Salonia, MD, PhD, a specialist in urology and endocrinology at San Raffaele Hospital.

In a press release, Salonia said it was not clear if COVID-19 infections caused a drop in testosterone or was a pre-existing condition in the patients.

["...research has shown that some receptors for the virus, including the enzyme TMPRSS2, are linked to male hormones and that the virus reduces the number of Leydig cells in the body, which produce testosterone.

"We simply don't have the data to know which came 1st in these patients, the low testosterone levels or the COVID," explains Professor Salonia. "Testosterone does play a role in protecting men from disease. However, it's also possible that the virus itself is able to induce an acute reduction in testosterone levels, which then predisposes these men to a worse outcome. We're now following up these patients over a longer time period, to see how their hormone levels change over time, so we can try and answer these questions."

Seven to 9 months postacute COVID-19 infection, 39.0% of 410 adults still had symptoms of long COVID-19, according to a study yesterday [6 Jul 2021] in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

The researchers included symptomatic outpatients in Geneva enrolled from 18 Mar-15 May 2020. Of those who responded to follow-up at 7-9 months post-infection, 39.0% still had symptoms, of which half experienced one or 2 symptoms (27.6% and 26.4%, respectively).

Of 311 participants who checked in at all 3 follow-up points (enrollment, 30-45 days, 7-9 months), 37% had symptom resolution at the 30- to 45-day mark, and 19% more had resolution at 7-9 months, for a total of 56%.

At 7-9 months, the most common symptom was fatigue (20.7%), and of the 85 patients who experienced it, 27.0% said it was bad enough to restrict strenuous physical activity. A little over 10% of patients who still experienced symptoms reported shortness of breath (11.7% of 48), with 60.4% saying that it occurred even when walking up a slight hill or hurrying on ground level. Other frequent symptoms included loss of taste or smell (16.8%) and headache (10.0%).

Almost 3/4 of the 7- to 9-month cohort (72.4%) had no prior COVID-19 risks (e.g., hypertension), the researchers note, and 67.1% were females. The average age of the original 629 participants enrolled at baseline was 42.1 years.

"Recognition of postacute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 and potential predictors is important in reaching a more thorough understanding of the disease and its long-term effects," the researchers write. "With a high prevalence of symptoms at 7-9 months, physicians should continue to monitor patients with COVID-19 over the long term."

Although sex is associated with different COVID-19 mortality rates and can affect pharmacological side effects, only 4% of COVID-19 studies on <ClinicalTrials.gov> explicitly plan to include it as a variable, according to a Nature Communications study yesterday [6 Jul 2021].

The researchers looked at 4420 registered COVID-19 studies from 1 Jan 2020-26 Jan 2021 and found that 21.2% addressed sex and gender solely in the context of recruitment, 5.4% planned sex-matched or representative samples or emphasized sex reporting, and 4.0% explicitly stated there was a plan to include sex as a variable.

While some study summaries may not mention their complete plans, the researchers note that only 17.8% of 45 COVID-19 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) published by 15 Dec 2020 report sex-disaggregated analyses.

Most studies that mention sex as an analytical variable are observational and patient registry studies (132 [74.2%]) or have matching/reporting (153 [64.6%]), data showed. Also, only 1.3% of 1161 pharmacological intervention RCTs and 2.4% of 1314 other interventional studies have registered a plan to consider sex as an analytical variable.

This issue has had low priority throughout the pandemic, the researchers write, adding, "Ignoring sex and gender aspects of COVID-19 is not scientifically or ethically justifiable, and interventional trials should be designed to account for these variables."

["The investigation of sex differences could provide essential insights into COVID-19 pathophysiology and possibly aid the identification of effective interventions. In addition to the study of sex differences, gender-sensitive analysis is warranted (6). Gender, a multidimensional variable describing identity, norms, and relations between individuals (7), can influence access to testing, diagnosis, medical care, and pharmacological treatments, and significantly affect the availability of social, economic, and logistic support (6). Gender can also influence preventative and risk behavior, possibly impacting the course of the infection (8). Both sex and gender can influence the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and the safety profile of drugs (9,10)." (from Nat Commun paper above. See paper for references and full text.) - Mod.LK]

On a bright, crisp morning in March [2021], [SG] said goodbye to his stuffed tiger, Stripes, and his cat, Meowington, and started walking the 2 short blocks to Herbert Schenk Elementary School in Madison, Wisconsin. He had started kindergarten there months ago, but he had only seen his teacher on a computer screen. This would be his 1st day inside the school. He looked tiny in his NASA mask and raccoon hat, which he had pulled down over the hood of his coat. He felt shy and a little nervous about the transition from 'zoomie' to 'roomie.'

Outside the school, carefully chalked messages lined the pavement: "We can't wait to see you!" and "Welcome Ks". Signs directed parents to "Drop your shark off here" and "Hug and kiss goodbye here". [SG] hesitated briefly, then made his way to the open double doors.

Back in March [2021], the decision to reopen Schenk and other shuttered schools across the United States sparked heated debate. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had announced that schools could reopen safely without driving up community spread or putting teachers and students at risk, as long as steps were taken to mitigate transmission of the virus. But that did little to calm the anxiety among parents, school staff, and even scientists. It sometimes spilled into public arguments.

Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, often tweets about COVID-19 and schools, but she took a break in March [2021]. The discourse became too emotional, especially when people lobbed horrible accusations at her. "There is one thing that always ends an argument," she says. That's "the statement that you would want children dead."

Now, as the academic year wraps up in many countries, school administrators are taking stock of their experiences and looking to public health officials to help them plan for the coming school year. In the United Kingdom, children returned to school in March and April [2021]. In France, a 3rd COVID-19 wave shuttered schools briefly around that time, but pupils were back in class by May [2021]. In the United States, more than half of all school districts had resumed full-time instruction by early June [2021], and nearly all offered at least some in-person learning.

But across the world, 770 million children still weren't going to school full time by the end of June 2021. And more than 150 million kids in 19 countries had no access to in-person schooling. They were either learning virtually or had no schooling at all. Even when schools open back up, many kids won't return. The United Nations cultural organization UNESCO estimated last year [2021] that around 24 million schoolchildren will drop out as a result of the pandemic. Because they provide so many essential services in addition to learning, schools should be the last to close and the 1st to open, says Robert Jenkins, chief of education for the UN children's charity UNICEF in New York City. "There are many countries in which parents can go out and have a nice steak dinner, but their 7-year-old is not going to school," he says. "That's a problem."

A growing body of evidence suggests that schools can be opened safely. But that hasn't quelled debate over whether they should be open and, if so, what steps should be taken to limit the spread of the virus. By September [2021], when schools in many parts of the world will open again, fresh concerns and debates will be in play. Many teenagers and preteens will have been vaccinated in the United States and other wealthy countries. But in some low- and middle-income countries, vaccine access will still be limited. Younger children will probably still be in the queue in most parts of the world. And the virus continues to mutate and evolve. "The big unknown is a new variant," says Christina Pagel, a mathematician at University College London.

In March 2020, when many schools shut their doors, little was known about SARS-CoV-2. "We closed schools early, not only to help flatten the curve, but also because for most respiratory illnesses, children are the most at risk," says John Bailey, a visiting fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington DC who recently reviewed the literature on schools and COVID-19.

Scientists soon discovered that kids are the least likely to develop serious illness, but it wasn't yet clear whether children were as susceptible to infection as adults, and whether kids who did get infected could pass the virus on to others. Some researchers worried that sending children back to school might fuel the pandemic. But the debate soon shifted from a scientific one to a political one.

Some of the political divisiveness was inevitable, says Ellen Peters, a decision researcher and director of the Center for Science Communication Research at the University of Oregon in Eugene. People who are conservative have different world views from people who are more liberal. But "Trump so vastly exacerbated that", she says.

Other countries weren't immune to the squabbling. When Danish primary schools reopened in April 2020, some parents worried that their kids were being used as guinea pigs. In France, where schools have mostly remained open, teens protested last November [2020], saying that COVID-19 protections inside classrooms were inadequate. In some districts, teachers failed to show up as the coronavirus swept through communities. And parents were reluctant to report cases because they would have to isolate at home with their children and might lose their jobs. In Berlin, authorities scrapped plans to partially reopen schools in January [2021], in the middle of a national lockdown, after backlash from parents, teachers, and government officials.

One sticking point was the issue of prioritizing vaccines. When schools began to open up in March and April [2021], the vast majority of teachers hadn't yet been vaccinated. That made weighing up the risks and benefits particularly tricky. "The biggest risks are for the adults in the school system," says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland. "And the benefits of being in the classroom are for the kids."

Equity also became a flashpoint in the debate. Researchers argued that remote learning would widen disparities between white students and students of color in many countries. "The fear is that achievement gaps will become achievement chasms for those kids," says Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a non-partisan research and policy analysis organization in Seattle, Washington. And kids of color aren't the only groups that have been forgotten, Lake says. "We also know that students with disabilities have been left behind, and kids with other complex needs."

In the United States, however, surveys showed that families of color didn't necessarily want in-person schooling. When schools did open, these families were among those least willing to send their kids back. That's not surprising, says Durryle Brooks, a social scientist at Johns Hopkins University and policy chair for the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners. "Systems have continually failed Black and brown people in this country," he adds. Why would that trust suddenly appear now? And sending pupils back to in-person school wouldn't fix the achievement gap. In Baltimore City, Black students have been underperforming" for a long time, even before the pandemic, Brooks says.

Now, more than a year after the pandemic began, researchers know a lot more about COVID-19. And they know more about how the disease does (and doesn't) spread. Although some kids and teachers have caught SARS-CoV-2, schools don't seem to be environments where transmission is rampant. "The rates in the schools have not been higher than in the community," Tracy Hoeg, [an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis,] says.

Tracking cases in schools is relatively straightforward. But what public health officials really want to know is whether students and staff are spreading the virus on school grounds, or just bringing in cases they acquired elsewhere. That's trickier to tease out.

One of the largest studies (1) on COVID-19 in schools in the United States looked at more than 90 000 pupils and teachers in North Carolina over 9 weeks last autumn. Given the rate of transmission in the community, "we would have expected to see about 900 cases" in the schools, says Daniel Benjamin, a pediatrician at Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina, and co-lead author on the study. But when the researchers conducted contact tracing to identify school-related transmissions, they identified only 32 cases (see 'Meagre spread' [Zimmerman KO, et al.: Pediatrics. 2021; 147, e2020048090]).

That study, published in January [2021], "should have been a watershed event for people who were really going to just be data driven with their policy", says Jeanne Noble, an emergency physician who directs the COVID-19 response at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center. Yet many schools remained closed. Since then, "it's just been a slew of other similar studies", Noble says.

Another study (2) looked at 17 schools in rural Wisconsin. The research team observed 191 COVID-19 cases in staff and students during 13 weeks in the autumn of 2020, a time of high transmission for that area. Only 7 of those cases seemed to originate in the schools. A 2nd study, not yet published, looked at Nebraska. "They were open the whole year with over 20 000 students and staff, and there were only 2 transmission events during that entire study period," Hoeg says.

Critics argue that without surveillance testing, kids who don't have symptoms won't be identified or counted, so the true number could be much higher. But even if the real case numbers were double or even triple the numbers in these studies, the transmission rate would have been much lower than in the community, Benjamin says. "It's safer for them to be in school than to be outside of school."

Studies that have included testing tend to show similarly low transmission rates. Researchers in Norway (3) identified 13 confirmed cases in children aged 5-13 in schools, and tested nearly 300 of their close contacts to assess the secondary attack rate, the percentage of contacts who become infected from a single case. Just 0.9% of the child contacts and 1.7% of the adult contacts contracted the virus.

In Salt Lake City (4), researchers went one step further. They offered COVID-19 tests to more than 1000 students and staff who had come into contact with any of 51 pupils who had tested positive. Of the roughly 700 people who took the tests, just 12 tested positive. The scientists then used contact tracing and genetic sequencing to identify transmissions that occurred at school. Only 5 of the 12 were school-related, an attack rate of just 0.7%. This suggests that students who contract the virus don't tend to spread it at school. A similar study (5) in New York City found that the attack rate was even lower, just 0.5%.

When mitigation measures aren't in place, however, attack rates can be much higher. In Israel (6), schools reopened in mid-May 2020. Within 2 weeks, a large outbreak occurred in one secondary school. Administrators tested more than 1200 close contacts of the 2 people who initially tested positive. They identified 153 infected students and 25 infected staff members, attack rates of 13.2% and 16.6%, respectively. By mid-June [2020], the Ministry of Health had identified nearly 90 more cases among the close contacts of those who were initially infected, including family members, friends, and teammates. The outbreak was probably exacerbated by a heatwave. To make conditions less stifling, the government had rolled back its mask-wearing rules, and schools had closed windows and started using air conditioning, which recycled air inside the classroom. There were too many students to ensure social distancing.

The bulk of the literature on transmission in schools, however, suggest that kids aren't driving viral spread. Investigations in Germany, France, Ireland, Australia, Singapore, and the United States show no, or very low, secondary attack rates within school settings.

"It has been perpetuated in the American media that COVID is dangerous and kids are superspreaders and schools are super-spreader places," Hoeg says. "And none of that has been validated in the scientific literature."

That's not to say there are no risks. Some children have died of the disease. A study (7) looking at COVID-19-related deaths in children in 7 countries found that 231 kids died of the disease between March 2020 and February 2021. In the United States, the number as of June [2021] was 471. Some who died succumbed to a rare, but terrifying inflammatory syndrome. And emerging evidence hints that at least some kids who become infected have symptoms that persist. Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist at the Queen Mary University of London, says some of her colleagues seem too blase about the impact of COVID-19 on children. "It has really puzzled me why we're so comfortable exposing children to a virus that we haven't studied that much," she says.

But keeping kids out of school comes with its own set of risks. Many parents have seen the social isolation take its toll and witnessed their children struggling to stay engaged with lessons delivered by screen. Emerging studies suggest that kids in remote-learning situations are falling behind academically, especially children who were already struggling. Schools provide more than education. They serve as a safety net for many kids, offering free meals and a safe place to spend the day. Educators and school counsellors are often the first to spot signs of domestic or sexual abuse and intervene. What's more, the closure of schools has been a disaster for many working parents. Those with young children were left trying to juggle virtual school, normal parenting duties, and their own jobs.

Emergency physician Leana Wen, currently at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health in Washington DC, argues that many have been focused on the wrong question. "Stop asking whether schools are safe. Instead, acknowledge that in-person instruction is essential; then apply the principles we learned from other essential services to keep schools open," she wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece. Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, agrees. "We've already decided school is important," he says. And "we should do important things, even when they're hard."
