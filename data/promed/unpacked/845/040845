Due to warming temperatures in the Russian Federation, there is intensified activity of ticks, carriers of dangerous infectious diseases including tick-borne encephalitis virus (hereinafter TBE), Ixodes tick borreliosis (CBI), Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and other diseases transmitted by their bites.

Rospotrebnadzor is monitoring for diseases transmitted by ticks, and the public is being informed about tick bites by medical organizations who are carrying out a set of anti-epidemic measures aimed at preventing the occurrence of these diseases.

According to weekly operational monitoring, up to 9 Jun 2015 in 79 regions of the Russian Federation, medical organizations reported 235 281 persons affected by tick bites, including 57 627 children. The greatest number of tick bites were recorded in Kemerovo, Sverdlovsk, Tomsk, Vologda, Tyumen, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, Krasnoyarsk, Altai, Perm and St. Petersburg.

TBE: 139 cases registered in Irkutsk, Novosibirsk, Tyumen, Kostroma, Tver, Pskov, Kaliningrad, Novgorod, Sverdlovsk, Kurgan, Kirov, Kemerovo, Omsk, Krasnoyarsk and Altai, Perm, Trans-Baikal and the Seaside Territories, Republic of Komi, Karelia, Tatarstan. Altai, Khakassia, Buryatia, Tuva, Bashkortostan, St. Petersburg, and Moscow (imported case from the Altai region).

CCHF: 44 cases registered in Rostov, Volgograd, Voronezh (imported case from Crimea) regions, Stavropol Territory, Republic of Kalmykia, and Karachay-Cherkessia (imported case from Stavropol Territory).

CBI: 538 cases registered in Kaliningrad, Moscow, Lipetsk, Belgorod, Vladimir, Bryansk, Kaluga, Kostroma, Kursk, Tambov, Tver, Yaroslavl, Vologda, Pskov, Leningrad, Murmansk, Nizhny Novgorod, Samara, Kirov, Kurgan, Tyumen, Sverdlovsk, Kemerovo, Irkutsk, Tyumen, Novosibirsk, Amur regions, the Republic of Udmurtia, Republic of Karelia, Adygea, Mari El, Tatarstan, Mordovia, Tyva, Perm, Krasnodar, Primorsky, Khabarovsk, Krasnoyarsk and Zabaikalsk, St. Petersburg, and Moscow.

Prevention
-------
One of the most important means of non-specific prevention of infections transmitted by ticks is the protection of individual persons, including observance of rules of conduct in relation to the dangerous territory of ticks, wearing special protective clothing, and application of modern acaricide and tick-repellent agents for the treatment of outdoor clothing and equipment. The situation is under the control of the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare.

[It should be noted that compared to the same period in 2014, the total number of persons affected by tick bites has increased by 15 percent. In 2014, the number of cases of tick-borne encephalitis was 1984 (542 in the 1st half of the year), Ixodes tick borreliosis, 6375 (1782 for the 1st half of the year), and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, 91 (69 in the 1st half of the year).

[Reports of TBE virus infections this early in the transmission season are unusual. Late summer and autumn are the usual seasons for TBE virus transmission. Hard ticks (_Ixodes_) have acquired the virus from their rodent hosts and are reactively questing for late-season blood meals.

Mod.CP noted: "Tick-borne encephalitis is now a vaccine-preventable disease. It is caused by closely related but distinct flaviviruses. The International Committee on Virus Taxonomy recognizes 3 TBE virus subtypes: a far-eastern subtype, a Siberian subtype, and a European subtype. The Siberian subtype is associated with Russian spring-summer encephalitis and is transmitted predominantly by the tick _Ixodes persulcatus_
(see image at http://www.planktonik.com/museum/images/insects/0205dani01.jpg),
whereas the European subtype causes central European encephalitis and is transmitted by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_
(see image at http://www.biopix.com/photos/ixodes-ricinus-00078.jpg).

The former causes the more serious disease, with mortality that can reach 25 per cent, whereas mortality in the case of the latter seldom reaches 5 per cent. Effective vaccines are now available against each subtype." The types of TBE virus responsible for the above cases are not stated.

CCHF virus is also transmitted by ticks. The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp. ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who are in contact with patients. The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days. CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_ [not a flavivirus like the TBE types]."
