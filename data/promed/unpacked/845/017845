[Again this week, outbreaks cover significant distances -- from
Xinjiang autonomous region in the extreme northwest to Hunan
province, which borders Guangdong province in the southeast. For maps see:
<http://www.flu.org.cn/map/MapBrowser.aspx?reportId=18>
<http://poultrymed.com/files/index.html>
These seem to be small isolated cases which the Chinese authorities
appear to be having excellent success in stamping out quickly and
preventing clusters of disease. It will be important to know more
about the source of these outbreaks, as they may continue with some
regularity. - Mod.PC]
