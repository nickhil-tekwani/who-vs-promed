There was no appreciable change in titres, so the case is being diagnosed
as negative for EEE [virus infection]. The horse is still very ataxic and
will probably have to be put down. No other horses in the pasture have been
affected. All the "standard" ante-mortem CNS tests have been run with
negative results.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Schomer for providing the information that
eliminated EEEV as the etiological agent in the infection in this Nebraska
horse.

The 17 Sep 2010 edition of the Grant Tribune Sentinel (ProMED-mail archive
no 20100918.3375) reported a case of mosquitoborne eastern equine
encephalitis virus (EEEV) in a Keith County Nebraska horse. The basis on
which the initial EEEV diagnosis was made was not stated.

Nebraska is considerably farther west than the known geographic range of
EEEV. There have been several equine cases in Michigan this year (2010),
but nothing further west, so a case in Nebraska, although possible, would
be highly unusual. Fortunately, the Nebraska State Veterinarians office
alertly followed up and laboratory results from the USDA National
Veterinary Services Laboratories discarded EEEV infection. Had the case
been one of EEEV infection, the antibody titer in the convalescent phase
serum sample would have been significantly higher than that of the acute
phase sample. It was not. There is no indication of what has afflicted this
horse.
