In Jhapa [district, Province One], an unidentified disease which rots corms of banana plants ravaged commercial banana plantations. [It] first appeared 6 months ago and has been spreading since. Once infected, the corm -- a swollen underground stem -- decays and the leaves turn pale-yellow before the plant dies.

"We are facing troubles identifying the disease while it is spreading at an alarming rate," said a farmer. "We are undertaking sanitary measures to treat the plants but to no avail." The plant does not bear [fruit] once infected and if it already has born some, the bananas do not grow but rot.

Officials have inspected the plantation but have not identified the disease yet. Farmers are planning to send samples to Indian laboratories. According to an [agricultural] officer, authorities are working to identify the strange disease. "We have to identify and eradicate the disease or else it will cause extensive damage to the fruits and the whole plantation," he said.

[A number of banana pathogens have been reported from the region, including, for example, _Banana bunchy top virus_, as well as the fungal diseases of black and yellow sigatoka (_Mycosphaerella_ species) and Panama disease (_Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_), including tropical race 4 (TR4). (For more information, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives.)

Symptoms described above are not sufficient to speculate on the disease or disorder referred to. Reliable diagnosis is required as a basis for designing control or management strategies for the affected farmers.

Previously, an unidentified banana disease has been reported from Nepal's central region (ProMED-mail post 20160113.3933767), but it is unclear whether there has ever been a diagnosis of causes or whether it is thought that there may be any similarities or connections between the 2 outbreaks.
