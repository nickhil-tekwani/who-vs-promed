The USA Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection
Service (FSIS) is issuing a public health alert due to concerns about
illnesses caused by _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Heidelberg that
may be associated with use and consumption of ground turkey. This
public health alert was initiated after continuous medical reports,
ongoing investigations and testing conducted by various departments of
health across the nation determined there is an association between
consumption of ground turkey products and an estimated 77 illnesses
reported in 26 states. The illnesses were linked through an
epidemiologic investigation and PFGE analyses by state health
departments and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The CDC is partnering with state health departments to monitor the
outbreak while the FSIS focuses its investigation on potential
identification of a contamination source(s).

The FSIS reminds consumers of the critical importance of following
package cooking instructions for frozen or fresh ground turkey
products and general food safety guidelines when handling and
preparing any raw meat or poultry. In particular, while cooking
instructions may give a specific number of minutes of cooking for each
side of the patty in order to attain 165 degrees F internal
temperature, consumers should be aware that actual time may vary
depending on the cooking method (broiling, frying, or grilling) and
the temperature of the product (chilled versus frozen) so it is
important that the final temperature of 165 degrees F must be reached
for safety. Please do not rely on the cooking time for each side of
the patty, but use a food thermometer.

Ground turkey and ground turkey dishes should always be cooked to 165
degrees F internal temperature as measured with a food thermometer;
leftovers also should be reheated to 165 degrees F. The color of
cooked poultry is not always a sure sign of its safety. Only by using
a food thermometer can one accurately determine that poultry has
reached a safe minimum internal temperature throughout the product.
Turkey can remain pink even after cooking to a safe minimum internal
temperature of 165 degrees F. The meat of smoked turkey is always
pink.

Recommendations for Preventing Salmonellosis:
---------------------------------------------
Wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and
after handling raw meat and poultry. Also wash cutting boards, dishes
and utensils with hot soapy water. Clean up spills right away.

Keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be
cooked. Use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg
products and cooked foods.

Cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating.
The safe internal temperature for meat such as ground beef and pork is
160 degrees F, and 165 degrees F for poultry, as determined with a
food thermometer.

Refrigerate raw meat and poultry within 2 hours after purchase (1 hour
if temperatures exceed 90 degrees F). Refrigerate cooked meat and
poultry within 2 hours after cooking.

[ProMED awaits more information regarding the ground turkey implicated
in this outbreak of _S._ Heidelberg. Certainly with the prominent
high temperatures in the USA of late, prompt, effective refrigeration
of raw meat and poultry is essential as well as the cooking and
kitchen hygiene techniques noted above.

ProMED has previously posted on a large (about 700 cases) outbreak of
_S._ Heidelberg associated with the "Taste of Chicago" food festival
in the summer of 2007. This outbreak was traced to a Middle Eastern
food booth. - Mod.LL]
