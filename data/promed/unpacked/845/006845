Mystery solved: Storm killed birds
-------------------------------------
State lab results are in and it's official: A storm system killed dozens of
birds in early August 2003.
State agriculture officials are attributing the death of more than 100
birds in North Stafford in August 2003 to severe thunderstorms after lab
tests failed to provide any other answer.
The state Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services yesterday
received the results of toxicology tests that showed no evidence of
poisoning, said department spokeswoman Elaine Lidholm. Previously, the
birds had undergone necropsies and microscopic tissue exams, which had
ruled out disease such as West Nile virus. "Having eliminated the other
possibilities, and given the way they were found, and the weather that
night, Dr. [Joe] Garvin strongly suspects it was death due to strong winds
and/or possibly a lightning strike," Lidholm said.
Garvin, veterinarian and program manager in the state agriculture
department's Warrenton lab, asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
National Veterinary Services Lab to perform the microscopic tissue exams
and toxicology tests after he found no obvious cause of death during
necropsies on 8 Aug 2003. More than 100 birds were found dead about 2 miles
apart on 6 Aug 2003.
The night before, the North Stafford area saw several lightning strikes,
high winds, heavy rain and nickel-size hail. The National Weather Service
had issued a tornado warning for that evening between 8:29 and 9:15 p.m.
Someone reported seeing dead birds at Aquia Towne Center that night, and a
warden with the State Department of Game and Inland Fisheries collected 68
dead house sparrows from the sidewalk there the next day. Employees at the
USA Barber Shop in the Stafford Pointe commercial complex on Garrisonville
Road arrived for work 6 Aug to find about 3 dozen of the small birds
littering the parking lot and beneath a large tree. The game warden
collected a sample of those birds, taking a total of 9 from the 2 locations
for examination at the state agriculture lab. After microscopic tissue
exams failed to offer an answer, Garvin had begun to suspect the storms as
the cause, Lidholm said.
