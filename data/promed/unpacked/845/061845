Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, Australia
-------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 7 Jul 2015 from Dr Mark Schipp, chief veterinary officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Canberra, Australia

Summary:
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 13 May 2015
Date of confirmation of the event: 1 Jul 2015
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2)
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Canberra, Australian Capital Territory
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 May 2015
Outbreak status: resolved 7 Jul 2015
Epidemiological unit: natural park
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
European rabbit: _Oryctolagus cuniculus_ (Leporide) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comment: Rabbit calicivirus has been used in Australia as a biological control agent since 1995. Routine testing of a dead wild rabbit found a rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) genotype cluster calicivirus, a strain not previously detected in Australia.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (national laboratory) / European rabbit / gene sequencing / 1 Jul 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is an extremely contagious and often fatal viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits. This disease affects only rabbits of the species _Oryctolagus cuniculus_.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by the rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus _Lagovirus_ and family _Caliciviridae_. Many strains of RHDV appear to circulate in rabbit populations; these viruses can have distinct epidemiological and genetic characteristics. Only a single serotype is known, but two major subtypes exist: RHDV and the antigenic variant RHDVa. Nonpathogenic strains of RHDV have been identified in wild rabbits. One recent study suggests that different lineages of RHDV may have repeatedly emerged as epidemic viruses.

RHD is endemic in Australia, New Zealand, Cuba, parts of Asia and Africa, and most of Europe. Outbreaks have also been reported from domesticated rabbits in the Middle East and the Americas." (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/rabbit_hemorrhagic_disease.pdf)

According to recent publications, the emerging lagovirus Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) has been described as a strain that infects not only rabbits but also hares. (http://tinyurl.com/pttjtp5)

RHDV2 is less virulent and with lower observed mortality rates than RHDV and RHDVa. However, the disease resulting from RHDV2 is longer in duration and will take a chronic or subacute course more often than RHD caused by the other viral strains. http://biome.biomedcentral.com/new-lagovirus-identified-as-cause-of-rabbit-haemorrhagic-disease/

Subscribers may want to refer to these 2 interesting articles which describe this new strain:

There is no indication that exposure to RHDV is associated with infection or disease in humans. http://tinyurl.com/pf4doyf. - Mod.CRD
