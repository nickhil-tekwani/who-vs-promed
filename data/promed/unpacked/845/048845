Four of the 7 sailors of the Dolphin cargo ship were victims of aluminum phosphide poisoning on Thu 13 Feb 2020, 60 miles (110 km) southwest of Lanveoc (Finistere). One of them died. The other 3 were transferred to the Cavale Blanche hospital in Brest in serious condition.

At around 6:30 p.m. on Thu 13 Feb 2020, the 88-meter Bahamas-flagged vessel set sail from Sables-d'Olonne (Vendee) to Hull (England) to alert the Cross Corsen (Coast Guard at Corsen Point, Brittany) to the situation.

In bad weather conditions (wind 50 to 60 km/hr and waves 6 to 9 m), the Cayman helicopter of the French Navy, based in Lanveoc, placed a diver and a team from the Samu on the ship. On board, the death of one of the 4 intoxicated sailors was noted. The health of the 3 other victims is stable, but the weather did not permit the helicopter hoist to be used.

To make it easier for people to disembark, the ship headed for Brest at night. The crew of the Notre-Dame-de-Rocamadour canoe from the SNSM station of Camaret-sur-Mer evacuated the victims from the freighter to the port of Brest.

Aluminum phosphide is a smoke-producing pesticide used in agricultural and industrial settings. It contributes to the protection of stored foodstuffs, in particular cereals. Aluminum phosphide poisoning leads to high mortality.

[For this particular toxin to be used in a closed space such as a ship is extremely dangerous, and while it is sad there is one death, it could have been so much worse. We hope those ill have a speedy and uneventful recovery.

"Aluminum phosphide (AlP; Al is for aluminum and P is for phosphide) is a highly toxic, low cost, effective, and commonly used pesticide, a fumigant for control of insects and rodents. It is primarily used for indoor fumigation of raw agricultural commodities, animal feeds, processed food commodities, and non-food commodities in sealed containers or structures, and for outdoor fumigation of burrows to control rodents and moles in non-domestic areas, non-cropland, and agricultural areas.

Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are formulated as tablets, pellets, impregnated materials and dusts. Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are restricted use chemicals. The use by certified pesticide applicators (at least in the USA) with respect to rodent control for burrows at least 15 feet (4.6 m) from a residential structure is considered a residential use.

Aluminum and magnesium phosphide react with moisture in the atmosphere to produce phosphine gas, which is the substance that is active as a pesticide. It liberates lethal phosphine gas when it comes in contact either with atmospheric moisture or with hydrochloric acid in the stomach. The release of phosphine gas from AlP is immediate when mixed with aqueous solutions, such as water, and leads to rapid absorption through the lungs and gut when swallowed. Its gaseous form and toxicity make it a potential agent for chemical terrorism.

Unfortunately, AlP is now one of the most common causes of pesticide poisoning among agricultural workers.

The mechanism of toxicity includes cellular hypoxia due to the effect on mitochondria, inhibition of cytochrome C oxidase, and formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals. The signs and symptoms are nonspecific and instantaneous.

The toxicity of AlP particularly affects the cardiac and vascular tissues, which manifest as profound and refractory hypotension, congestive heart failure, and electrocardiographic abnormalities. The diagnosis of AlP usually depends on clinical suspicion or history but can be made easily by the simple silver nitrate test on gastric content or on breath. Due to no known specific antidote, management remains primarily supportive care.

Aluminum and magnesium phosphide are in Toxicity Category I, the highest (most toxic) of 4 categories, for acute effects via the inhalation route. No significant exposure to phosphine gas is expected via dermal routes, although rarely dermal absorption has been the route of lethal exposures. The Environmental Protection Agency does not believe that aluminum and magnesium phosphide pose a carcinogenic concern.

Histopathological findings of vital organs were found to be suggestive of cellular hypoxia. Myocardial muscles in non-survivors showed myocyte vacuolation, areas of myocytolysis and degeneration. Histological changes on human brain showed disorganisation of the different layers, paucity of glial cells, degeneration of neurons, and appearance of necrotic patches. In other organs like in lung, diffuse vessel injury with edema and atelectasis; in liver, centrilobular necrosis; and in kidney, tubular degeneration findings may be present.

The permissible exposure limit of phosphine is less than 0.3 ppm in the working environment and levels greater than 50 ppm are dangerous to life, while at 400-600 ppm it is lethal within half an hour. Individuals working in the manufacturing facility of AlP or methamphetamine (phosphine is a by-product), engaged in placing AlP tablets on the stacks of grains, and in the vicinity of application are at risk for unintentional exposure of phosphine gas, with few reported fatalities.

Cases have existed in animals fed grain that was exposed to phosphine tablets but not allowed to sit for long enough prior to being fed to the animals. Animals have died in all of these cases."
