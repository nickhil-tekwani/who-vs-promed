Wheat scab is widespread
------------------------
Heavy spring rainfall in Missouri has created ideal conditions for
wheat scab. The fungal disease is widespread throughout the wheat
growing regions of the state and threatens to lower yields and reduce
seed quality. "It's been a long time since we've had a statewide
problem with scab," says Laura Sweets, University of Missouri (MU)
Commercial Agriculture Extension plant pathologist. "You really need
wet conditions as the crop is flowering and right after flowering for
scab to take off."

Wheat scab, also known as fusarium head blight, affects wheat heads
and kernels. Damaged kernels can result in major declines in yield
and quality. Signs of scab include shrunken or discolored kernels
with a pink or chalky tinge. Some may appear as "tombstone kernels,"
which are white, softer than normal and have an odd texture. Farmers
with discolored, stunted kernels may be docked on wheat at the
elevator. The fungus can produce mycotoxins that may affect
livestock, lowering feed intake and reducing weight gain.

It's too late in the season to treat scab with fungicides, Sweet
says, but farmers can try to reduce the number of tainted grains at
harvest by setting the combine to blow out as much lightweight
material as possible. Those thinking of saving seed should first
determine the level of scab in the field, have the seed cleaned, do a
germination test, and consider using a seed treatment.

Wheat scab in Nebraska for second year in a row
-----------------------------------------------
The wet spring [2008] has nurtured scab in Nebraska wheat fields.
Scab, also known as fusarium head blight, plagued the fields last
year [2007] as well. The disease can cost farmers much of their crops
if their grain is rejected because of toxins the fungus can produce.
Normally scab is found in south-central and eastern Nebraska, but
this year it has shown up as far west as Imperial.

Plant pathologist Stephen Wegulo says it's too close to harvest for
growers to combat the problem this year. He says scab is fought by
planting tolerant cultivars, rotating crops, and applying fungicide
at early flowering.

[Fusarium head blight (FHB; also known as scab) on wheat is caused by
several fungal species originally classed into the genus _Fusarium_,
accounting for the common name of this disease. Current names of the
fungi are _Gibberella zeae_, _Fusarium poae_, _Monographella nivalis_
var. _nivalis_, and _Microdochium majus_. FHB causes yield losses of
up to 45 percent and reduces the grade of harvested grain. It may
also contaminate the grain with fungal toxins, for example vomitoxin,
which can affect stock and may lead to reduced feed consumption or
feed refusal. Disease management includes timely fungicide
applications and crop varieties with reduced susceptibility.
