A respiratory illness likely caused by a virus circulating on Prince
of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska has killed one person and put
another on a ventilator in an Anchorage hospital, the state Division
of Public Health said Monday [6 Oct 2008].

Genetic testing on samples taken from patients indicates the cause of
the outbreak is adenovirus 14, a particularly virulent version of a
common bug best known for causing "that respiratory crud in the
winter," said division epidemiologist Beth Funk. "It's a fairly
common virus, but this particular type, adenovirus 14, hasn't been
seen commonly up until lately," Funk said. "In the last year it's
been the main player in a couple of outbreaks that looked somewhat
like the one that they're having on Prince of Wales Island."

Indications are that the virus is responsible for causing pneumonia
in at least 32 people on the island and sickening an untold number of
others who did not go to a clinic seeking medical treatment, she
said. 7 of the 32 cases were severe enough to warrant medevacs to
hospitals in surrounding communities, including one patient who was
taken to Alaska Native Medical Center in Anchorage to be put on a
ventilator. One woman died, she said. "That individual also had
fairly significant underlying lung disease -- chronic obstructive
lung disease -- and it would have put that person at a higher risk
for bad outcome with any other infection on top of that," Funk said.

After a physician reported 22 Sep 2008 that an unusual number of
people were falling ill, the division sent a team to the island to
pore over medical records, Funk said. Scientists at the state
virology laboratory in Fairbanks and at the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta collected specimens and
conducted tests to determine the cause of the outbreak, Funk said.
The CDC identified adenovirus in 6 of 13 samples sent to it. "If you
can get a predominant germ on a fairly good proportion of those
tests, then you go with that," Funk said. "You don't have to have
every single test be positive, because no test is perfect."

While some infected people might not show any symptoms, others
develop a sore throat, cough, fever or pneumonia. Severe pneumonia
and death are rare in otherwise healthy people, but the infirm are at
increased risk for such complications, according to the CDC.

The virus spreads similarly to the common cold. It is transferred
from person to person by coughing and sneezing, and it can also be
contracted by touching an object, like a doorknob, that has the virus
on it and then touching one's mouth, nose or eyes, according to the
CDC. As with other viruses, there's no cure for adenovirus; it moves
through a community and will eventually cycle itself out, Funk said.
Because there is a fair amount of travel to and from the island,
particularly to Ketchikan, there was some concern the illness could
spread to other communities, she said. But there have been no reports
of widespread illness off the island and, even before the likely
cause of the illness was known, there were no plans to quarantine
people there or otherwise restrict travel, she said. Health officials
were recommending people wash their hands often and cover their
mouths when they cough to avoid contracting and spreading the virus.

[Adenovirus 14 has been associated with sporadic lower respiratory
tract infection in the past, but recent outbreaks in Oregon, New
York, Texas and Washington (see references below) heralded the
appearance of a more virulent strain of adenovirus 14. It will be a
challenge for epidemiologists to explain the spread of adenovirus
14-associated disease outbreaks in diverse communities throughout the
length and breadth of the United States. - Mod.CP]
