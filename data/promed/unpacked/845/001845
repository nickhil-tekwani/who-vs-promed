A villager in northwestern Thailand has been infected with anthrax, said a senior government official on [Tue 28 Nov 2017]. Public Health Ministry Undersecretary Chetsada Chokdamrongsuk confirmed that the unidentified villager in Mae Sot district of Tak province, about 470 km [approx. 292 mi] northwest of Bangkok, has contracted the bacterial disease after he had slaughtered a goat believed to have carried _bacillus anthracis_.

Another villager of Mae Sot, across the Thai-Myanmar border from Myawaddy township, is yet to be tested to see whether he may as well have contracted the disease during the slaughtering of the goat, allegedly smuggled from inside Myanmar.

Anthrax could possibly be transmitted from infected livestock such as cattle, sheep and goats to humans via the skin and respiratory system, he said. The bacterial disease may cause severe ulceration of the skin and pneumonia.

[The previous cases - 3 villagers in Tambon Mahawan - arose from butchering 5 or 6 goat carcasses found dumped in the village. In this case the 2 men slaughtered a sick goat possibly in a different village - the wording is not clear - smuggled in from Myanmar. The 1st of this pair of new cases has been confirmed; the 2nd awaits results. All in all it indicates a serious caprine outbreak in or around Myawaddy, Myanmar.

To find Tak, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/thailand_admin-2013.jpg where you will find it in the middle of the Thai border with Myanmar. - Mod.MHJ
