Brucellosis (dog disease)
-------------------------
Lewis County [WA] health officials say 15 dogs have now tested positive for
_Brucella canis_. And 3 other dogs could also test positive in the coming
weeks. They were found on the property of a woman who rescues and breeds
dogs. About 110 dogs were found on the property; many of them living in
filthy conditions. Officials are advising anyone who has obtained a dog
from the woman to have it checked out by a vet.
_Brucella canis_ is a particular strain of brucellosis that infects dogs.
The disease is not easily transmitted to humans and is relatively mild,
with the exception of individuals with immune compromising conditions
(patients with cancer, HIV infection, or transplants) and young children.
In dogs, the disease is transmitted during breeding causing females to
abort and males to develop long term chronic infections.
Treatment in dogs is not very effective and the recommended management to
prevent the spread to other dogs is euthanasia of infected dogs.
Brucellosis is transmitted by contact or by contaminated food, water, and
excrement. Health officials are trying to stop to the transmission of this
dog disease to the other dogs on the property and prevent it from spreading
to other dogs in the county.
Anyone who received a dog from this woman along Hwy 508 near Mary's Corner,
Hwy 12 at the Ethel Market area or from a parking lot in any of the
businesses at Exit 79 in Chehalis since mid February is advised to take it
to a veterinarian or an animal shelter. Health officials say, do not dump
the dog along the road or out in the country. People who are concerned
about exposure can consult with Lewis County Public Health Department at
360-740-1222.

[_B canis_ is a cause of abortion in kenneled dogs. Dogs are the definitive
host of this organism, and natural infections in other animals are rare.
Infection has caused a reduction of 75 per cent in the number of pups
weaned in some breeding kennels. The disease disseminates rapidly among
closely confined dogs, especially at time of breeding or when abortions
occur. Transmission occurs via ingestion of contaminated materials or
venereal routes. Both sexes appear to be equally susceptible. Transmission
of brucellosis from dogs to humans occurs but appears to be very rare.
Primary signs are abortion during the last trimester of pregnancy without
premonitory signs, stillbirths, and conception failures. Prolonged vaginal
discharge usually follows abortion. Abortions may occur during subsequent
pregnancies. Infected dogs may develop generalized lymphadenitis and
frequently epididymitis, periorchitis, and prostatitis. Spondylitis and
uveitis are occasional complications. Bacteremia is frequent and persists
for about 18 months after exposure. Fever is not characteristic.
Diagnosis is based on isolation and identification of the causative agent
or by serology. The organisms can usually be readily isolated from vaginal
exudate, aborted pups, blood, milk, or semen of infected dogs. The most
widely used serologic test is an agglutination test by a tube or slide
method. Nonspecific agglutination reactions occur in some dogs from which
brucella has not been isolated. To eliminate nonspecific antibodies, the
serum is treated with 2-mercaptoethanol and retested. An agar gel
immunodiffusion test performed in some laboratories is quite specific.
Attempts at immunization have not been successful. Control is based on
elimination or isolation of infected dogs identified by positive cultural
or serologic tests. Incidence of infection is much lower in kennels where
dogs are caged individually. Longterm therapy, eg, with a combination of
streptomycin or gentamicin and tetracycline, has been successful in many
cases. Neutering of infected dogs is sometimes an alternative to euthanasia.
The brucella agent is often found concentrated in an infected dogs urine.
Cleaning of urine by immune suppressed individuals may put them at risk for
the disease.
