An identified case of a bird infected with avian pox in Long Beach has prompted Long Beach Animal Care Services (ACS) to urge the community to be on alert and protect pet birds and chickens against the virus.

"While avian pox cannot be transmitted to humans, dogs or cats, it can cause significant mortality in certain populations of birds, including flocks of chickens," Ted Stevens, manager of ACS, said in a statement today [25 Sep 2017].

The California Animal Health and Food Safety (CAHFS) laboratory confirmed a pigeon in Long Beach was infected with avian pox, according to ACS. Other types of birds, including crows, were also suspected to have the virus. Avian pox spreads among birds and is part of the larger family of poxviruses.

"Avian pox causes blisters on the unfeathered parts of a bird's skin (eye, head, feet), which then turn into vesicles, nodules, and then burst and form scabs, much like human smallpox," according to the release. "It is transmitted from bird to bird via contact such as pecking, but can also be transmitted via mosquitoes, which have been shown to carry and transmit the virus to birds for up to a month."

[Avian pox is a slowly developing disease of birds caused by several different strains of avipoxvirus. A variety of birds worldwide, including upland game birds, marine birds, Passeriformes, and Psittaciformes can become infected.

Avian pox occurs in 2 forms, the cutaneous being the most common. The cutaneous form of pox causes warty growths on unfeathered skin, sometimes in large clusters. The size and number of growths depend on the stage and severity of infection. Birds are often emaciated due to inability to feed (see picture of the lesions at https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DIgKkmo_Ovc/hqdefault.jpg). In the diphtheritic form, there are raised, yellow plaques on the mucus membranes of the mouth and throat.

Transmission occurs via direct contact with infected birds, ingestion of food and water contaminated by sick birds or carcasses, or contact with contaminated surfaces such as bird feeders and perches. The virus enters through abraded skin. Insects, especially mosquitoes, may act as mechanical vectors. The disease can be a significant mortality factor in some upland game bird populations during fall and winter months, in songbirds over winter, and in raptor populations. - Mod.PMB
