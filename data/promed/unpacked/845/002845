Mozambique: targeted emergency food aid for Nampula
---------------------------------------------------
The World Food Program (WFP) will provide targeted emergency
assistance to some 50 000 pregnant and nursing mothers and children
under 5, in Mozambique's northern Nampula province. The response
follows an outbreak of brown streak disease, which had devastated
large portions of the cassava crop in several districts of Nampula.
WFP's deputy director in Mozambique, Karin Manente, told IRIN that an
assessment mission had visited the affected districts to establish
needs. Cassava is the main staple food in that part of the country.
According to Manette, Save the Children US will support 50 000
pregnant and nursing women, as well as children under 5 years old, in
the affected districts with a ration of fortified blended foods.
The "targeted food assistance" would be aimed at the most vulnerable groups
only, not to general food aid distributions. About 300 metric tonnes (mt) of
food aid will be distributed every month to beneficiaries of the program,
which is to run for 6 months from early November 2004.
Manente expressed concern about the status of the food aid pipeline
in Mozambique. On Thursday [21 Oct 2004] last week, WFP launched a
regional appeal for USD 404 million to support a monthly average of
1.5 million people in 5 Southern African countries, including
Mozambique.
"For next year [2005], we need USD 74 million; for the whole of next
year, we need more than 3000 mt [of food aid] per month, and, come
January, we don't have anything in our pipeline. So, we are very
concerned," Manente added.
A cycle of drought, floods, and consequent food shortages, coupled with the
impact of HIV/AIDS, has severely eroded the coping ability of households in
the most affected areas of Mozambique, and ongoing support of the communities
affected by [these] shocks is important to the country's recovery, "otherwise
you will lose all the gains you have worked for," Manente commented.
WFP's Regional Director for Southern Africa, Mike Sackett, said: "If
we don't step in now with support, there's a very real danger that
Southern Africa will descend into a perpetual cycle of tragedy, with
children missing out on education, and vital agricultural knowledge
being lost."

[Cassava brown streak virus disease (CBSD) is now the most economically
important biotic stress affecting cassava in the coastal lowlands of Eastern
and Southern Africa. Research efforts are being directed to increase the
availability and utilization of improved cassava varieties, and to strengthen
the national germplasm generation and deployment capacities in Kenya,
Tanzania, and Mozambique.
