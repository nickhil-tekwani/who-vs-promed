Central African Republic: Suspected cases of cholera detected in a village near Kouango
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5 suspected cases of cholera were detected in the town Gbabaté, Kouango sub-prefecture [Ouaka prefecture] with no deaths, according to the epidemiological report on the disease.

Health facilities struggling against cholera have observed a regression of suspected cases of the disease in recent weeks. The decline coincides with a new outbreak that has just been declared in the village of Gbabaté, Kouango which included 5 suspected cases with no deaths. According to a source close to the Ministry of Health, these cases occurred in the same family. [Speaking] on the spread of this disease in this family, the source said that "the suspect patient contracted the bacterium during a funeral ceremony in the village and returned to Tingba Gbabaté where he then infected 4 members of his family."

Located on the bank of the Oubangui [River] (RCA), the village faces Gbabaté Dula (DRC) where one of the cholera outbreaks is. To prevent the spread of the disease, health officials have stepped up awareness of hygiene and sanitation measures, added the same source.

Since the declaration of cholera, 10 Aug 2016 in the Central African Republic, 265 cases with 21 deaths have been recorded. The Health Regions No. 1, No. 4 and No. 7 are the most affected by this epidemic.

Cholera outbreak hits Cape Coast
--------------------------------
The Central regional capital Cape Coast has recorded new cases of cholera, according to the Cape Coast Health directorate. Some 10 people in the Cape Coast Metropolis have been diagnosed with cholera and are receiving treatment in the various health facilities in the region. The victims, mostly adults, are said to have eaten contaminated food according to health experts.

The Cape Coast metropolis was one of the areas worst hit by the disease in the year 2014 during the national cholera crises. Out of the 2182 reported cases, over 20 people lost their lives.

The current situation has been described by health experts in the region as having reached an epidemic status as more and more health facilities continue to record cases of the disease in the metropolis including the regional hospital.

Benjamin Amoako, head of the disease control unit of the Cape Coast Metro Health Service, in an interview with Starr News' Central regional correspondent Kwaku Baah-Acheamfour warned the public to keep good hygiene, especially their food intake, while again being quick to visit the nearest health post if they start developing symptoms of the disease.

Yemen's Cholera Cases Soar to 1410 within Weeks: WHO
----------------------------------------------------
The number of suspected cholera cases in Yemen has ballooned to 1410 within 3 weeks of the outbreak being declared, the WHO said Friday, 28 Oct 2016, as 18 months of Saudi aggression against the Arab country has destroyed most health facilities and clean water supplies.

Yemen's Health Ministry announced the outbreak on 6 Oct 2016 in Sana'a city, and by 10 Oct 2016, the WHO said there were 24 suspected cases. The following day, a WHO official in Yemen said there was "no spread of the disease", Reuters reported.

But Friday, 28 Oct 2016, WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a Geneva news briefing that as of 27 Oct 2016 there were 1410 suspected cholera cases in 10 out of Yemen's 23 governorates -- mostly in Taiz, Aden, Lahij, Hudaydah and Sana'a.

WHO said Wednesday, 26 Oct 2016, that only 47 of the suspected cases had tested positive for cholera and the outbreak had spread beyond the capital to 9 other governorates. Children under 10 accounted for half of the cases with 6 deaths from cholera and 36 associated deaths from acute watery diarrhea, the WHO said in the 26 Oct 2016 report.

[Poverty, flooding, drought, and war are the 4 horsemen of cholera. The conditions in the impoverished Arabian Peninsula country of Yemen are ideal for the rapid spread of _Vibrio cholerae_. Accurate statistics are clearly difficult to assess in Yemen at this point but are likely to continue to rise dramatically in this country of more than 24 million inhabitants. Spread northward across the border to Saudi Arabia is likely as well as eastward to Oman. - Mod.LL
