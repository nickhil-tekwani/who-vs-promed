A measles outbreak last year in Indiana in which 34 people became ill
was spread by a 17-year-old U.S. girl who visited Romania without
being vaccinated, U.S. health officials said on Thursday.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention detailed the
cause of the outbreak -- the largest in the United States since 1996
-- in an annual report on measles.
CDC said there were 66 confirmed cases of measles in the United
States in 2005, with no deaths. The 37 cases of measles in 2004 were
the fewest ever recorded in the United States.
The highly infectious, sometimes fatal viral illness has largely been
eliminated in the United States by vaccination.
Dr. Philip Gould of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service said the
17-year-old girl was infected during travel lasting less than 2 weeks
to Romania, where she did missionary work at an orphanage.
Many of the people sickened in the outbreak had attended a gathering
to welcome her back after her trip, Gould said, and most were
unvaccinated school children. In all, one Illinois resident and 33
Indiana residents were sickened.
"The reason why this outbreak in Indiana didn't become larger was in
large part because the surrounding community was highly immunized," Gould said.
"Physicians should continue to focus on immunizing their patients,
especially those in higher-risk categories like international
travelers, school-age children and health care workers," he added.
Fifty of the 66 people who contracted measles in the United States
last year [2005] were unvaccinated, CDC said. Seventeen were infected
while traveling abroad.
A smaller outbreak was traced to a 6-year-old visitor from Nigeria
who was hospitalized in Ohio, and another limited outbreak occurred
among people who had returned to Texas after a family reunion in
Mexico, CDC said.
Before the measles vaccine was introduced in the 1960s, there were
about 450 000 measles cases and an average of 450 measles deaths
annually in the United States.

Measles --- United States, 2005
-----------------
Measles is a highly infectious, acute viral illness that can be
complicated by severe pneumonia, diarrhea, and encephalitis and can
result in death. In the prevaccine era, approximately 500 000 cases
of measles occurred annually in the United States (1). During 2005,
local and state health departments reported to CDC 66 confirmed cases
of measles (incidence rate: less than one case per 1 million
population), 34 of which were from a single outbreak in Indiana
associated with infection in a traveler returning to the United
States. This report describes the epidemiology of U.S. measles cases
in 2005 and documents the absence of endemic measles and the
continued risk for imported measles infections that can result in
transmission within the United States. The findings underscore the
need to maintain the highest possible measles vaccination coverage in
the United States and to adhere to recommendations regarding measles
vaccination.
Case Classification
---------------
In accordance with state laws and regulations, health-care providers,
laboratories, and other health-care workers report measles cases to
state and public health departments; this information is forwarded to
CDC. Data on variables such as vaccination status, age,
complications, transmission setting, and serologic confirmation of
cases also are collected.
In 2005, of the 66 cases reported, 44 (66 percent) were confirmed by
laboratory testing, including 19 with detection of both IgM
antibodies and virus (by polymerase chain reaction, culture, or both)
and 25 with only measles IgM detected. The remaining 22 (33 percent)
were confirmed by meeting the clinical case definition* and by being
linked epidemiologically to a laboratory-confirmed case.
Twenty-four (36 percent) of the 66 infections were imported,**
including 17 (71 percent) in U.S. residents who acquired measles
while traveling abroad and 7 (29 percent) in non-U.S. residents who
acquired the disease abroad and traveled to the United States.
Measles was imported from 16 countries on 4 continents.*** Of the 24
patients with imported measles, 8 (33 percent) were infectious during
airline flights (i.e., rash onset occurred some time during the
period 4 days before through 4 days after date of U.S. arrival). No
secondary transmission was identified among flight crew members or
passengers seated in the same row or the row in front of or behind
the infectious person.
The other 42 (64 percent) cases were acquired in the U.S.,**** of
which 38 (90 percent) were import linked and 4 (10 percent) had
unknown sources of exposure. Thirty-three (87 percent) of the 38
import-linked cases were part of a single outbreak in Indiana, traced
to exposure in Romania. Of the remaining 5 import-linked cases, 2
patients were linked to measles imported from Nigeria, and 3 were
linked to only one other case. Overall, 62 (94 percent) of the 66
cases in 2005 were determined to be import associated (i.e., either
imported or U.S. acquired but import linked).
Age and Sex Distribution
-----------------
Distribution of the 66 measles patients by age group was as follows:
7 (10.6 percent) measles patients were aged less than 1 year, 4 (6.1
percent) 1--4 years, 33 (50 percent) 5--19 years, 7 (10.6 percent)
20--34 years, and 15 (22.7 percent) greater than 35 years. Thirty-one
(47 percent) patients were male, and 34 (52 percent) were female; the
sex of one patient was not recorded.
Geographic and Temporal Distribution
----------------------------
The 66 cases were reported from 16 states. Five states reported more
than 2 cases: Indiana (33 cases), New York (7 cases, including 6 from
New York City), California (4 cases), and Texas and Ohio (3 cases each).
Cases were reported during 28 of the 52 reporting weeks [see Figure
at above provided URL link]. The longest period during which no cases
were reported was 8 weeks, from week 38 through week 45. The median
number of cases reported per week was one (range: zero to 14 cases).
The maximum number of cases reported during a single week was 14 (week 22).
Vaccination Status
-------------
Of the 66 persons with measles, one had been vaccinated with 2 doses
of a measles-containing vaccine and 7 (11 percent) with 1 dose; 50
(76 percent) were unvaccinated, and 8 (12 percent) had unknown
vaccination status [see Table at above provided URL link]. Fifteen of
the 17 U.S. residents who acquired infection while traveling abroad
had been eligible for vaccination with 2 doses of measles-containing
vaccine, according to recommendations from the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices (ACIP) (4). However, 4 (27 percent) had been
vaccinated with only 1 dose; 8 (53 percent) had not been vaccinated
(including 3 infants aged 11--12 months), and 3 (20 percent) had
unknown vaccination status. Two of the 17 U.S. residents were
ineligible because they were born before 1957 (one had not been
vaccinated; the other had unknown vaccination status). Of the 7
visitors (non-U.S. residents) with imported measles, one (14 percent)
had been vaccinated with 1 dose; 4 (57 percent) had not!
been vaccinated (including one infant aged 8 months), and 2 (29
percent) had unknown vaccination status. Among the 42 U.S.-acquired
cases, one patient had been vaccinated with 2 doses; 2 (5 percent)
patients had been vaccinated with 1 dose, and 37 (88 percent) had not
been vaccinated (including 29 [69 percent] persons aged 1--19 years).
The vaccination status of 2 patients (5 percent) was not known.
Outbreaks
------
During 2005, 3 measles outbreaks (i.e., with 3 or more
epidemiologically linked cases) were reported to CDC. These outbreaks
affected 3 states and accounted for 40 (61 percent) of the 66
reported cases. An outbreak in Indiana with 34 cases (including one
Illinois resident) resulted from an unvaccinated U.S. resident aged
17 years who returned home after acquiring measles infection in
Romania. Of the 34 patients in this outbreak, 32 (94 percent) were
eligible for vaccination. Of these, one patient aged 16 years had
been vaccinated with 2 doses, a health-care worker aged 34 years had
been vaccinated with only 1 dose, and 28 (88 percent) patients aged
1--19 years had not been vaccinated, primarily because their parents
were concerned about potential adverse events associated with
vaccination. Vaccination status for 2 patients, aged 43 and 45 years,
was unknown. Two other patients were ineligible because of their
ages: one was aged less than 12 months, and the other was born befor!
e 1957 and presumed immune to measles. Among the school-age patients
(aged 5--19 years), 20 (71 percent) were schooled at home. Three
persons were hospitalized during this outbreak, including the
health-care worker, who was treated in the intensive care unit and
recovered (5,6).
A 2nd outbreak was traced to a visitor aged 6 years from Nigeria, who
was hospitalized in Ohio. Cases of measles in 2 U.S. residents, an
unvaccinated health-care worker and an unvaccinated person aged 89
years, were linked to the hospital setting. A 3rd outbreak involved 3
U.S residents, 2 adults and a child aged 20 months, who had traveled
together to a family reunion in Mexico and might have been exposed
during air travel before returning to Texas. The adults had been
vaccinated; the child had not been vaccinated.
Viral Genotypes
--------------
Five genotypes of measles virus were identified in specimens from 19
patients representing 11 importations. Genotype D4 was identified in
2 travelers to France and Germany, 2 visitors from Romania and Yemen,
and 8 patients with U.S.-acquired measles linked to an imported case
from Romania (the Indiana outbreak). Genotype B3 was identified in a
refugee from Kenya and 2 of the 3 U.S. travelers to Mexico (7).
Genotype D8 was identified in 2 U.S. residents returning from India.
Genotypes D6 and D9 were isolated from a foreign visitor from Armenia
and a child returning from Indonesia, respectively. Measles viruses
in the 4 U.S.-acquired cases with unknown sources were not genotyped.

MMWR Editorial Note:
The epidemiology of measles in 2005 supports previous conclusions
that endemic transmission of measles has been eliminated in the
United States (8,9). Measles incidence was low (less than one case
per million population), measles cases were geographically isolated,
and 95 percent of cases were linked to importations (i.e.,
internationally imported or U.S-acquired, import-linked cases). In
addition, no predominant and recurring viral genotype was detected,
and the measles genotypes detected, in most circumstances, had been
circulating within the country of presumed exposure (10).
Half of all the cases in 2005 are traceable to one unvaccinated U.S.
resident, who was infected during a visit to Romania of less than 2
weeks. This outbreak was the largest documented in the United States
since 1996. All but 2 of the 34 patients in this outbreak were
unvaccinated. The outbreak occurred because measles was imported into
a population of children whose parents had chosen not to vaccinate
their children because of safety concerns, despite evidence that
measles-containing vaccine is safe and effective (4). A major
epidemic was averted because of high vaccination levels and a low
rate of vaccine failure in the surrounding community. The cost of
containing this outbreak was estimated at USD 167 685 (5). This
outbreak and other cases reported during 2005 likely could have been
prevented had existing ACIP vaccination recommendations been followed
(4). The index case traveler should have been vaccinated with 2 doses
of measles-containing vaccine before departure; expos!
ed school-age children and personnel working in health-care
facilities also should have had the recommended 2 doses before exposure.
The epidemiology of measles in 2005 highlights the need to maintain
the highest possible measles vaccination coverage in the United
States and to continue to address the concerns of those who choose
not to be vaccinated or who choose not to vaccinate their children.
Because 100 percent coverage in U.S. residents might never be
achieved and because communities of unvaccinated persons continue to
exist, accurate surveillance and rapid response to outbreaks are
essential to preventing widespread transmission of imported measles.
Moreover, providing assistance to other countries to control measles
globally can limit the risk for imported measles in the United States.

[The above reports serve to further highlight the importance of
maintaining high vaccination coverages against measles, even in
countries where domestic transmission of measles virus has
theoretically been eliminated. The fact that 76 percent of cases in
the USA during 2005 were unvaccinated is further testimony to this. A
sobering bit of information in the above reports was the observation
that 32 out of 34 cases that occurred in the outbreak associated with
the importation of the measles virus from Romania occurred in a
population that had not been vaccinated due to parental concern about
possible vaccine side-effects. The "side effects" from natural
infection with measles virus include acute encephalitis, delayed
encephalitis (SSPE - subacute sclerosing pan encephalitis), diarrhea
(with severe dehydration), primary measles virus related pneumonia to
mention a few, all associated with significant morbidity and
mortality -- a tradeoff that clearly warrants the preventive
administration of measles vaccine.
The availability of genotyping of measles isolates has further
assisted in the geographic tracing of measles viruses responsible for
individual cases as well as outbreaks. The fact that 95 percent of
the cases confirmed in the USA in 2005 were genetically associated
with importations is an indication that high vaccination levels have
most probably eliminated domestic transmission of the measles virus
in the USA (an effort that began with the measles elimination
initiative back in the late 1970s when this moderator was a medical
epidemiologist in the then Immunization Division at CDC). A pity
that the measles viruses in the 4 U.S.-acquired cases with unknown
sources were not genotyped, to further determine whether these cases
might have been related to importation.
The URL links for the references listed in the MMWR report were
included where available, and are definitely worth reading for those
who are interested in measles. - Mod.MPP]
