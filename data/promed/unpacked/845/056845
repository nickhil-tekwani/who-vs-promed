UK Government: Another area free from classical swine fever
------------------------------------------
A second infected area in East Anglia was declared free from classical
swine fever (CSF) today and the relevant Infected Area Order has been
revoked.
Pigs can now be freely moved on and off about 160 farms previously in the
Infected Area imposed around the Norfolk breeding unit where the outbreak
is believed to have originated. It had been confirmed as infected on 9
August - the second of 15 premises to be confirmed with CSF following the
start of the outbreak on 8 Aug 2000.
The infected area in north Essex was the first to be pronounced clear of
the disease, and movement restrictions lifted on more than 90 farms
there, on 22 Sep 2000.
The decision to lift the infected area was made following full veterinary
investigation. Similar investigations will be progressively undertaken in
the other infected areas with a view to lifting them as soon as possible.

Notes for Editors
1. Farmers in the remaining infected areas who have animal welfare
problems because of overstocking may apply for a licence to move pigs
within the same surveillance zone of an infected area, subject to strict
conditions. They can also apply to send pigs to slaughter under the Pig
Disposal (Welfare) Scheme. Details of both options are available from the
Bury St Edmunds control center helpline on 08702 414215. Farmers in
infected areas can also phone this number for general information
relating to the outbreak of CSF.
2. An EU ban on the export of live pigs and pig semen from Norfolk and
Suffolk remains in place until November 15. It will be reconsidered at
the next meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee of the EU.
