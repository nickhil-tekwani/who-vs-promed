Nearly 100 storks have been found dead in Chiclana lagoon (Cadiz), close to
the garbage dump of Miramundo. Days ago, several hundreds dead storks were
found in a nearby area.
According to the local Government in Cadiz, agents of the Nature Protection
Service (Seprona) of the police and technicians of the regional
Environmment Department have collected faecal samples of the dead birds and
water of the Jeli lagoon, to be investigated into the origin of this
massive die-off.
