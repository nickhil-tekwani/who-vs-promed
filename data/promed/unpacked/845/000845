Rift Valley fever in South Africa - update
------------------------------------------
As of 27 Apr 2010, German health authorities reported a laboratory
confirmed case of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in a traveller returning to
Germany after a trip to South Africa from 17 Mar to 8 Apr 2010 [see
ProMED-mail Rift Valley fever - South Africa (14): tourist 20100505.1450].

The case, along with 3 travel companions, visited rural areas and game
reserves along the coast of Eastern Cape and Western Cape provinces. On 7
Apr 2010, the case developed symptoms including fever, headache, and a rash
(exanthema). Almost concurrently a similar illness was reported in her
travel companions. German health authorities are currently investigating
the circumstances around infection in the confirmed case.

As of 3 May 2010, the Department of Health of South Africa has reported 172
cases, including 15 deaths since the beginning of the outbreak in Free
State Province, Eastern Cape Province, Northern Cape Province, Western
Cape, and North West Province. While it is reported that most of these
cases have had direct contact with RVF-infected livestock and/or are
epidemiologically linked to farms with confirmed animal cases of RVF, there
are a number of cases in which the route of transmission is currently
unknown. Exposure to infected mosquitoes in these cases cannot be currently
ruled out.

The Government of South Africa has implemented public health control
measures, which include development of key risk reduction messages for the
population at risk and guidelines to assist health workers in case
identification and reporting, laboratory investigations, clinical case
management, hospital infection control, and the public health measures for
prevention and control and animal vaccination in non-affected areas.

WHO advises no international travel restriction to or from South Africa.
However, WHO recommends that visitors to South Africa, especially those
intending to visit farms and/or game reserves, avoid coming into contact
with animal tissues or blood, avoid drinking unpasteurized or uncooked
milk, or eating raw meat. All travellers should take appropriate
precautions against mosquito bites (use of mosquito nets, insect
repellents). Travel medicine professionals and travel medicine services
should be aware of the current RVF situation in South Africa in order to
provide advice and care accordingly.
