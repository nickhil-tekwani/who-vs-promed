Aphid numbers are continuing to escalate in Canterbury [New Zealand] and
along with them the threat of the cereal crop disease, barley yellow dwarf
(BYD) in autumn- and winter-sown cereals. The disease is caused by the
aphid-transmitted barley yellow dwarf luteovirus (BYDV). BYD was one reason
for poor cereal quality and yields last season. Aphid numbers for the
current crop year are similar or in some cases higher than those recorded
last year according to Crop and Food Research scientist, David Teulon. He
advised farmers wishing to control the virus to apply an insecticide spray
now. While aphids transmit BYDV throughout the growing season, the plant's
early growth up to tillering was critical, he said.

[Barley yellow dwarf disease is the most destructive of the virus diseases
that affect wheat and other small-grain cereals. Work underway in
Australia and presumably elsewhere to map and clone the Yd2 gene for
resistance to BYDV may result in development of cereal cultivars that limit
expression of dwarfing and leaf yellowing. Cultivars expressing the Yd2
gene show less yield and seed size reduction when affected by BYDV or
drought. - Mod.DH]
