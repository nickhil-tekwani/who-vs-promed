An outbreak of leishmaniasis in Mardan district could not be controlled for more than 2 years, and the disease continues to disfigure victims and residents, health officials said.

Officials confirm that the disease has afflicted people in Bezo Kharkai, Jalala, Lund Khwar, Mian Esa, Ikrampura, Muslimabad and other rural areas in Mardan district. Over 890 cases have been reported to basic health units and other health facilities since 2012, and hundreds have gone unreported, but the epidemic failed to attract the attention of the Health Department.

Even the injection that treats the disease is not available at the health facilities, and hardly any efforts are being made to ensure its availability, officials said.

According to doctors, leishmaniasis is caused by the bite of infected sandflies. Sores appear at the bite sites that take weeks, months and even over a year [to heal] in treatment. Even after proper treatment, leishmaniasis leaves a permanent and unpleasant scar.

Residents and officials said some villages, including Muslimabad, Hajiabad, Majani, and Ghundai, had badly been hit by the epidemic. "Every family has a leishmaniasis patient in these villages," said a technician at a BHU. "You will see many, many women whose faces have been disfigured by it if you visit the area," he said in a sympathetic tone.

Official figures suggested that 60 cases were reported in March-April [2014] from Mian Esa, 5 from Jalala, 125 from Lund Khwar, and 122 from Ikrampura area. A resident of Kalo village near Lund Khwar told The News that the leishmaniasis patients had been left in the lurch by the government. "Every family has a member with open sores, but there is no one to come to their help," he said. "The government should ensure spraying in affected areas and treat the patients," he demanded.

"The leishmaniasis cases have been reported to hospitals since 2012," said a doctor who did not want to be named. "It's not life-threatening," he said, playing down the epidemic. Officials said that a woman's liver had become enlarged due to leishmaniasis and that she was in critical condition. They traced the sandflies to the camp of Afghan refugees in Palai area of Malakand Agency.

Officials and locals said the government was doing little to control the epidemic, and, therefore, it was spreading. They said spraying had not been carried out for killing the infected sandflies. Dr Niaz, an official of the Health Department in Mardan, said they were carrying out spraying regularly in the affected areas but conceded that leishmaniasis cases continued to happen in these rural areas. Asked when they had last carried out spraying, he said it was in March this year [2014]. The technician said Lund Khwar was last fumigated in June 2013.

An official of the World Health Organisation said fumigation in streets was not effective against leishmaniasis. He said spraying had to be carried out inside homes to prevent the disease. Glocantine, an injection effective for leishmaniasis treatment, is not available at the health facilities in the area, according to locals and officials.

"Leishmaniasis patients are forced to get treatment privately, as Glocantine is not available at health facilities. An injection costs PKR 600 [USD 6.20], and a patient has to get a course of 14 injections," the technician said. Dr Niaz said the DHO office did not have the said injection. "An NGO is working on it, and it provides these injections to facilities," he said, while being unable to give the name of the NGO.

[A detailed discussion of leishmaniasis in the tribal areas of Pakistan is included in the 3 Feb 2014 ProMED-mail post "Leishmaniasis - Pakistan: (TA) 20140203.2252445."

In the camps hosting Afghan refugees, the prevalence of cutaneous leishmaniasis is approximately 2.5 percent, with up to 5 percent having scars after cutaneous leishmaniasis.

A recent, comprehensive global review of leishmaniasis, including the situation in Afghanistan, can be found in: Alvar J, et al. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PloS One. Published: 31 May 2012, DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0035671 http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035671#pone.0035671.s086.

The review states: "The notification of leishmaniasis is not mandatory in the country. There is no national leishmaniasis control program and no leishmaniasis vector control program, but bednet distribution takes place in refugee camps. There is no leishmaniasis reservoir program."

Without a clear control strategy including mapping of the problem, local outbreaks will continue to occur and cannot be contained by treatment of symptomatic cases alone. - Mod.EP
