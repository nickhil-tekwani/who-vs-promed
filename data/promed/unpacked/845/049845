Dysentery, an epidemic [caused by _Shigella_ bacteria - Mod.JW usually
occurring in the summer after July, has already infected 125 people in the
first two months of this year. Last year, the disease appeared in March and
made 905 people sick by year-end. The early occurrence of dysentery, which
is transmitted through contaminated food and water, is causing concerns
that there will be even greater numbers of patients this year.
The Korean Food and Drug Administration (KFDA), affiliated with the Health
and Welfare Ministry, said 4,577 people came down with food poisoning last
year, sharply up from 2942 the previous year. Of the total, 30.2 percent,
or 1,385 patients were students infected after having meals at schools. The
statistics also showed that 360 company workers got sick after eating food
at their company cafeterias.
Health authorities have decided to step up food safety control over meals
provided by schools, for fear that mass food poisoning cases might increase
this year at school cafeterias.
Mass food poisoning affecting 300 or more people hadn't occurred in 1997.
But in 1998, two cases of mass food poisoning afflicted 675 people combined.
