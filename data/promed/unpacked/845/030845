A significant proportion of the world's coral has died this year as a
result of the highest sea temperatures on record, while in the areas
surveyed in the Indian Ocean, between 70 and 90 per cent is dead,
scientists said yesterday in Buenos Aires.
In the Indian Ocean, thousands of miles of reef have been killed including
in tourist areas such as the Seychelles, Mauritius and the Maldives.
Thousands of miles of corals in the Western Pacific, from Vietnam to the
Philippines and Indonesia, have died or bleached as they have been starved
of the symbiotic algae that provide their food and energy. The only large
areas of coral to have escaped some devastation are the atolls of the
central Pacific.
Dr Thomas Goreau, a scientist working with the International Union for the
Conservation of Nature, told a meeting at the climate change talks in
Buenos Aires: "The coral reefs are the canary in the mine for global
warming. They will go first." IUCN, the World Conservation Union, said
coral reefs provided over 100 countries with fish and other services such
as tourism worth $500 billion a year. They also prevented tidal waves and
erosion. They supported 93,000 fish species - 25 per cent of the total - in
0.3 per cent of its sea area.
A joint statement by IUCN's reef scientists said: "Unless this conference
takes effective action to stop global climate change, coral reefs and the
benefits they provide will be condemned to death. Other ecosystems will
follow."

On the latter website I found this global report of their 1997 'Survey'. It
has been extensively edited for length. I can support their comments on
Sarawak as I was in Sabah in 1986 and the coral reefs there were totally
dead thanks, I was told, to the widespread use of dynamite. - Mod.MHJ
Reef Check 97 Press Conference
Background Material

Reef Check '97, the first global survey of human impacts on the world's
coral reefs has been completed as part of the International Year of the
Reef, and the preliminary results are being released today. Organized by
HKUST's Institute for Environment and Sustainable Development, the survey
involved over 100 marine scientists and 750 recreational divers who
surveyed 300 coral reefs in 30 countries and territories between 15 June
and 31 August 1997.
Each Team Scientist was responsible for training the team divers in use of
Reef Check methods, then leading them on the actual field surveys, checking
and submitting data to headquarters in Hong Kong. The Reef Check methods
differ from those used in traditional ecological surveys in that they were
focused specifically on detecting the effects of humans on the coral reef
ecosystem. A large sample size (800 m2) was selected -- to be surveyed
twice, once for shellfish and once for fish. A third survey along a 100 m
line would be used to determine the condition of the corals themselves.
Teams were instructed to survey reefs which they believed were in
relatively untouched condition first.
The preliminary results from about 230 sites are being released today
because they reveal such a clear pattern of global damage to coral reefs,
particularly due to overfishing and destructive fishing. The results for
lobsters, which used to be abundant on reefs throughout the world, were
dismal. None were recorded at 81% of reefs surveyed. In the Indo-pacific
region, out of 179 reefs checked only 25 lobsters were found, and 11 of
these were recorded at one reef in an Indonesian marine reserve. Large
grouper are heavily fished throughout the world, and none were reported at
40% of the study reefs, with small numbers at most. However, more than 20
large grouper were recorded at two sites in the remote Maldive Islands, and
at three sites in the Red Sea where no poison or dynamite fishing occurs,
giving a hint of what populations used to be like in other areas. In the
Caribbean, the highly prized and previously common Nassau grouper was found
at only 4 of 51 sites, giving a total of 12 fish.
The corals themselves appeared to be in better shape globally than the fish
and shellfish. The mean percentage of living coral cover on reefs was 31%
globally, with the Caribbean recording the lowest value at 22%, possibly
reflecting recent losses due to bleaching and diseases. In the Red Sea,
there was less than half the dead coral (3%), than the other two regions.
The ratio of live to dead coral was highest in the Red Sea, suggesting that
these reef corals are the healthiest in the world. One apparent bit of good
news is that only 7 sites showed greater than 10% cover of fleshy algae,
indicating that nutrient enrichment associated with sewage pollution was
not a problem at most of these "good" sites. Sewage pollution may be more
important at reefs near urban areas which were not common in this study.
In the Indo-pacific, the humphead wrasse and barramundi cod were once
moderately abundant on reefs, but none were reported at 85% of 179 reefs
surveyed. Of more than 25 km of Indo-pacific reef surveyed in detail, only
26 humphead wrasse were seen. At the 125 Asian and Australian reefs
surveyed, only 5 barramundi cod were recorded. These results suggest that
cyanide and other forms of fishing have severely damaged populations of
these once moderately abundant species. High-value, edible sea cucumbers
used to litter the seabed around many reefs. The three species included in
Reef Check were totally absent from 41% of Indo-pacific reefs surveyed
demonstrating the extent of over-harvesting. An average of 17 giant clams
was found on the Indo-pacific reefs. An indication of what natural
populations used to be like was provided by the 150 to 250 giant clams
recorded at several protected sites in the Red Sea and Australia. Hong Kong
provides an example of coral reefs subjected to almost every form of
disturbance: overfishing, poison and dynamite fishing, pollution and
sedimentation. Out of 11 collectible or edible indicator species only two
(Trochus shells and butterflyfish) were recorded. Several of these
once-abundant species are now effectively extinct in Hong Kong.
In addition to making measurements, each team subjectively assessed the
intensity of human impacts at their sites. Based on this, 45% of the reefs
were rated as being subjected to low or no human impacts. In contrast, the
low numbers of fish and shellfish recorded in the surveys indicate that
almost all sites have been affected by heavy fishing of one or more
indicator species. One reason for this is that many fishing activities
occur at night, when sport divers are not present. In some areas such as
the east coast of Borneo, the reefs had not been previously surveyed, and
some scientists previously assumed that they would still be untouched. But
according to the Sarawak Reef Check team, "99% of the reefs have been
damaged by blast fishing."
