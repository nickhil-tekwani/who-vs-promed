Second NBC Employee Found to Have Skin Anthrax
------------------------------------------------------
A second NBC employee in New York previously suspected of having skin
anthrax after handling a letter mailed to news anchor Tom Brokaw last
month was confirmed to have the disease, officials said on Thursday.
New York City and federal health officials said at a news conference
that the employee began suffering from headaches, fever, malaise and
skin bumps 28 Sep 2001 and began taking antibiotics on 1 Oct 2001 to
treat the disease caused by the bacterium that has killed 3 people in
the United States this month. They said the employee is now taking
the antibiotic Cipro and was expected to make a full recovery.
A previously announced possible case of cutaneous anthrax in a second
NBC employee is now being classified as a suspicious or probable
case, New York City Health Commissioner Neal Cohen said in a
statement, confirming the fifth case of skin anthrax in New York, all
of them linked to media companies.
The letter had been postmarked 18 Sep 2001 in Trenton, New Jersey and,
like the letters sent to the New York Post and Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle, contained statements against Israel and the United
States and the words Allah in great.

State Department Mail Worker Has Anthrax
--------------------------------------
An employee at the State Department's remote mail facility in suburban
Virginia is hospitalized with anthrax, a spokesman announced Thursday.
Spokesman Richard Boucher said the mail handler works at a facility in
Sterling, Va., and went to the hospital on Wednesday with flu-like
symptoms. [another news report mentioned that mail received by the
facility in Sterling, VA had been through the Brentwood sorting
facility implicated in the other cases of anthrax in postal workers in
the Washington, DC area. - Mod. MPP
He tested positive for the disease, said the spokesman.
Authorities prepared to issue masks and gloves for its 800,000
employees & were testing ways to sterilize the nation's mail [with the
same irradiation equipment used to sterilise packages of food. -
Mod.JW
Health officials pleaded with people not to self-medicate with Cipro
purchased over the Internet because the drug can have side effects.
The CDC also on Thursday issued revised guidelines emphasizing that
inhaled anthrax can be treated with other, more common antibiotics.
Since the anthrax-by-mail crisis began, there have been 6 cases of
inhaled anthrax, the most serious form of the disease. Two postal
workers in Washington and a tabloid photo editor in Florida have died.
Capitol Police Lt. Dan Nichols on Thursday described anthrax found
outside an elevator on the first floor of the Hart Senate building as
not a significant amount and said investigators still were trying to
determine how it got there. Eisold emphasized no new cases of anthrax
exposure related to the finding had been reported, but encouraged
anyone who has been in the area to get tested.

New Jersey Probes Possible New Anthrax Case
---------------------------------------------------
New Jersey health officials said on Thursday they were testing a
second postal worker for possible inhalation anthrax.
A woman employed at a main U.S. postal processing and distribution
center in Hamilton Township, near Trenton, was hospitalized with
symptoms compatible with 2 other inhalation cases involving one of her
co-workers and a Florida tabloid newspaper employee who survived the
infection.
The case raised the potential number of anthrax cases among New Jersey
postal workers to 5, including 2 who were confirmed to suffer from
milder skin infections and one for whom tests for skin anthrax have
proved inconclusive.
Amid rising health concerns, New Jersey health officials have stepped
up protective measures several times over the past 3 days. They
expanded the state's protective antibiotic course for postal workers
twice: from 7 to 10 days on Tuesday, and again to the full 60-day
regimen suggested by federal guidelines on Thursday.
George DiFerdinando, commissioner of the state Department of Health
and Senior Services, said the changes were merited because of
widespread contamination at the Hamilton facility, where 19 of 53
samples have tested positive for anthrax.
Nasal swabs given to more than 800 of 1100 Trenton postal workers had
proved negative for exposure to anthrax spores.
