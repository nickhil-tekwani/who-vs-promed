[Unfortunately, we need more details, which should have been
provided. We need to know the kind of birds affected and specific
locations, at a minimum. Normally, we have to wait until the official
Disease Information comes out on Thursday night for details of a
outbreak. All that we can tell is that the outbreak appears to be
fairly widespread and therefore may have been around for some time,
making it more difficult to stamp out.
While NAMRU-3 is not an OIE World Reference laboratory, it is a
1st-class lab whose results should be reliable. - Mod.PC]
