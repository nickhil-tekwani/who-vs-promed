SALMONELLOSIS, SEROTYPE SAINTPAUL, TOMATOES - USA (04)

CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states, the
Indian Health Service, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to
investigate an ongoing multistate outbreak of human _Salmonella enterica_
serotype Saintpaul infections. An epidemiologic investigation comparing
foods eaten by ill and well persons has identified consumption of raw
tomatoes as the likely source of the illnesses. The specific type and
source of tomatoes is under investigation; however, the data suggest that
illnesses are linked to consumption raw red plum, red Roma, and round red
tomatoes, and products containing these raw tomatoes.

Since April 2008, 228 persons infected with _S._ Saintpaul with the same
genetic fingerprint have been identified in 23 states: Arizona (19
persons), California (2), Colorado (1), Connecticut (1), Florida (1),
Georgia (7), Idaho (3), Illinois (29), Indiana (7), Kansas (5), Michigan
(2), Missouri (2), New Mexico (55), New York (1), Oklahoma (3), Oregon (3),
Tennessee (3), Texas (68), Utah (2), Virginia (9), Vermont (1), Washington
(1), and Wisconsin (3). These were identified because clinical laboratories
in all states send strains from persons with salmonellosis to their State
public health laboratory for characterization. Among the 161 persons with
information available, illnesses began between 10 Apr 2008 and 1 Jun 2008.
Patients range in age from one to 88 years; 47 persons are female. At least
25 persons were hospitalized. No deaths have been officially attributed to
this outbreak. However, a man in his 60s who died in Texas from cancer had
an infection with the outbreak strain of _S._ Saintpaul at the time of his
death. The infection may have contributed to his death.

Only 3 persons infected with this strain of _S._ Saintpaul were identified
in the country during the same period in 2007. The previous rarity of this
strain and the distribution of illnesses in all USA regions suggest that
the implicated tomatoes are distributed throughout much of the country.
Because of inherent delays in reporting and because many persons with
salmonellosis do not have a stool specimen tested, it is likely many more
illnesses have occurred than those reported. Some of these unreported
illnesses may be in states that are not on today's [12 Jun 2008] map [for
map of affected states, see URL above. - Mod.LL]

Advice to consumers
-------------------
At this time, FDA is advising American consumers to limit their tomato
consumption to those that are not the likely source of this outbreak. These
include cherry tomatoes; grape tomatoes; tomatoes sold with the vine still
attached; tomatoes grown at home; and red plum, red Roma, and round red
tomatoes from specific sources listed at
<http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/tomatoes.html>.

Consumers should be aware that raw tomatoes are often used in the
preparation of fresh salsa, guacamole, and pico de gallo, are part of
fillings for tortillas, and are used in many other dishes.

Customers everywhere are advised to
- refrigerate within 2 hours or discard cut, peeled, or cooked tomatoes.
- avoid purchasing bruised or damaged tomatoes and discard any that appear
spoiled.
- thoroughly wash all tomatoes under running water.
- keep tomatoes that will be consumed raw separate from raw meats, raw
seafood, and raw produce items.
- wash cutting boards, dishes, utensils, and counter tops with hot water
and soap when switching between types of food products.

FDA recommends that American retail outlets, restaurants, and food service
operators offer only fresh and fresh cut red plum, red Roma, and round red
tomatoes and food products made from these tomatoes from specific sources
listed at <http://www.fda.gov/oc/opacom/hottopics/tomatoes.html#retailers>.

Cherry tomatoes, grape tomatoes, and tomatoes sold with the vine still
attached from any source may be offered.

[Since ProMED-mail's last posting on this ongoing outbreak on 7 Jun 2008
there have been 7 more states affected, Florida, Georgia, Michigan,
Missouri, New York, Tennessee, and Vermont with the total number of states
at 23. In addition, the number of reported outbreak cases has increased
from 161 to 228.

It is most likely in such outbreaks that the tomato contamination occurs in
the field but in most cases the exact route of the contamination is not
defined. Earlier in 2008, the Public Library of Medicine journal PLoS One
contained an article (Barak JD, Liang AS: Role of soil, crop debris, and a
plant pathogen in _Salmonella enterica_ contamination of tomato plants.
PLoS ONE 2008; 3(2): e1657. Available at
<http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0001657>)
that addressed, in part, this issue. The abstract is reproduced below.

"Background
-----------
"In the USA, tomatoes have become the most implicated vehicle for
produce-associated salmonellosis with 12 outbreaks since 1998. Although
unconfirmed, trace backs suggest pre-harvest contamination with _Salmonella
enterica_. Routes of tomato crop contamination by _S. enterica_ in the
absence of direct artificial inoculation have not been investigated.

"Methodology/principal findings
-------------------------------
"This work examined the role of contaminated soil, the potential for crop
debris to act as inoculum from one crop to the next, and any interaction
between the seed borne plant pathogen _Xanthomonas campestris pv.
vesicatoria_ and _S. enterica_ on tomato plants. Our results show _S.
enterica_ can survive for up to 6 weeks in fallow soil with the ability to
contaminate tomato plants. We found _S. enterica_ can contaminate a
subsequent crop via crop debris; however a fallow period between crop
incorporation and subsequent seeding can affect contamination patterns.
Throughout these studies, populations of _S. enterica_ declined over time
and there was no bacterial growth in either the phyllosphere [leaf surfaces
or total above-ground surfaces of a plant as a habitat for microorganisms.
- Mod.LL] or rhizoplane [the part of a plant's root that lies at the
surface of the soil, where many microorganisms adhere to it. - Mod.LL] The
presence of _X. campestris_ pv. _vesicatoria_ on co-colonized tomato plants
had no effect on the incidence of _S. enterica_ tomato phyllosphere
contamination. However, growth of _S. enterica_ in the tomato phyllosphere
occurred on co-colonized plants in the absence of plant disease.

"Conclusions/significance
-------------------------
"_S. enterica_ contaminated soil can lead to contamination of the tomato
phyllosphere. A 6-week lag period between soil contamination and tomato
seeding did not deter subsequent crop contamination. In the absence of
plant disease, presence of the bacterial plant pathogen, _X. campestris_
pv. _vesicatoria_ was beneficial to _S. enterica_ allowing multiplication
of the human pathogen population. Any event leading to soil contamination
with _S. enterica_ could pose a public health risk with subsequent tomato
production, especially in areas prone to bacterial spot disease." - Mod.LL]
