The results of analyses carried out in small ruminants (sheep and goats) in the governorate of MÃ©denine are positive for PPR [peste des petits ruminants] and negative for foot-and-mouth disease, said the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Fisheries, in a statement issued on Tuesday [15 Nov 2016], following the detection of 160 cases and the death of 35 others in the Souihel-dhouiher area of Zarzis district.

The provincial veterinary services carried out ring vaccinations of 7819 animals, belonging to 435 breeders, in addition to the vaccination of 6000 others under a sanitary mandate, disinfection of premises and treatment. A field survey, carried out following the appearance of PPR, showed that a number of breeders had acquired animals of unknown origin, which favored the appearance of this disease which affects goats and sheep, but is not transmissible to humans. The disease has been diagnosed in Tunisia since the summer of year 2008.

The ministry also called on breeders to verify the origin of the animals before buying them, in order to avoid the spread of such diseases and to respect the biosecurity measures, able to protect the national animal wealth.

Following its adherence to the global strategy for the control of PPR, Tunisia is working with its partners to develop a regional strategy to eradicate this disease.

[PPR has been present in Tunisia since 2008. Clinical disease has recently been reported in several provinces of the country, probably because of the decreased immunity status of animals that have not been regularly vaccinated.

It appears that the Tunisian veterinary authorities are still concerned about the possible presence of foot-and-mouth disease in small ruminants. It is for this reason that this disease was investigated in the cases observed and has been excluded before carrying out analyses aimed at the search for the infection with PPR virus. - Mod.AB
