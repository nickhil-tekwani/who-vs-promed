[1] Comment re vaccination post in ProMED-mail Ebola update (124): Sierra Leone, Eurosurveillance, Suspected, Research, Vaccine 20151108.3776823 by AJ Kucharski et al.

ProMED thanks Dr. Kucharski for submitting a response to the ProMED post of the news report on the ring vaccination modeling study [See ProMED mail Ebola update (124): Sierra Leone, Eurosurveillance, Suspected, Research, Vaccine 20151108.3776823 items 3 and 4] to be published in 2016: Kucharski AJ, Eggo RM, Watson CH, Camacho A, Funk S, Edmunds WJ. Effectiveness of ring vaccination as control strategy for Ebola virus disease. Emerg Infect Dis. 2016 Jan [date cited]. http://dx.doi.org/10.3201/eid2201.151410. The abstract from the new EID publication and the authors' comment follow with a response from ProMED Mod.JW.

Abstract: Using an Ebola virus disease transmission model, we found that addition of ring vaccination at the outset of the West Africa epidemic might not have led to containment of this disease. However, in later stages of the epidemic or outbreaks with less intense transmission or more effective control, this strategy could help eliminate the disease.

Comment from the authors:

We were surprised that ProMED chose to circulate a clearly erroneous summary of our Ebola ring vaccination modelling study from a news website rather than circulating a link to the paper itself: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/1/15-1410_article.[1]

VaccineNewsDaily.com's report, repeated on ProMED, stated that our study "found using ring vaccination at the beginning of the outbreak did not help to contain the virus. However, when the outbreak had decreased to a less-intense [sic] transmission rate, it helped eliminate the disease". Not only does this suggest that vaccine was in use at the start of the West African epidemic--which it was not--it misrepresents the methods and results of our study. Our mathematical model examined the effect of ring vaccination on Ebola transmission dynamics in a range of scenarios, including 1 in which case ascertainment was incomplete and missed cases result in large secondary clusters, based on published field data from 2014.[2,3] Our analysis found that under such circumstances outbreaks might not be contained with ring vaccination alone, though ring vaccination would still reduce overall transmission and case counts.

The interim findings of the Ebola ça Suffit rVSV vaccine cluster randomised trial [4] (in which co-authors CHW, AC and WJE are co-investigators) provide strong evidence that ring vaccination can have an important role in the control of Ebola virus disease. Indeed, a secondary outcome from the trial suggests the vaccine gives indirect protection to unvaccinated cluster members, which points to the potential role that ring vaccination can play as a containment measure. Our paper attempted to extend and generalise these findings by modelling a range of different scenarios. The results suggest that ring vaccination requires effective public health systems to deliver its full potential, including capacity for timely case ascertainment and response. If such capacity is insufficient or unavailable, then other vaccination strategies for Ebola control may need to be considered -- such as the hybrid ring and mass vaccination approaches used successfully against smallpox.[5].

[ProMED thanks Dr Kucharski for this clarification, but I disagree that the media report gives the impression that vaccination was available at the start of the epidemic. It is quite clear that the original report, available at http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/1/15-1410_article, is a model, and the media report quoted the abstract from that almost verbatim. The abstract states that "we found that addition of ring vaccination at the outset of the West Africa epidemic ***might not*** have led to containment of this disease." [see above]. Furthermore, there are many caveats in the text of the article about the conditions necessary for the success of ring vaccination, none of which were met at the start of the epidemic. - Mod.JW]

11 Nov 2015 UK: Ebola victim ["PC"] wins latest health battle
http://goo.gl/fkmlQG
[UK's (United Kingdom's) "Ebola nurse," PC was first hospitalized for the Ebola virus disease (EVD) contracted in Sierra Leone in late-December 2014 and discharged "Ebola free" from
Royal Free Hospital London (RFHL) in late-January 2015. She had issues with post-Ebola disorders following discharge, but was free from active EVD until 9 Oct 2015 when she was again admitted to RFHL for a resurgence of the original EVD infection (which was not known to be possible before) with the development of meningitis from the residual virus in her brain. In hospital, she had a rocky course, being declared critically ill at one point.
RFHL announced today that she is no longer in isolation, is not infectious, and had been discharged from its care and transferred to Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital to continue her recovery. Quoting PC: "I am forever thankful for the amazing care I have received at the Royal Free Hospital. I am looking forward to returning to Scotland and to seeing my family and friends again. For a 2nd time, staff across many departments of the hospital have worked incredibly hard to help me recover and I will always be grateful to them and the NHS."]
