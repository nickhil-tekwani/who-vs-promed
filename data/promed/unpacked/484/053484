[At the risk of being repetitious, poliovirus, both the wild virus (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), continue to be identified globally. In the past 2 weeks there is evidence of ongoing transmission of the WPV1 in 1 country with positive ESs (Afghanistan), and evidence of transmission of cVDPV1 in 2 countries (DR Congo and Mozambique) and of cVDPV2 in 4 countries (DR Congo, Nigeria, Yemen, and Zambia). Zambia is a new country identifying cVDPV2 in an environmental sample genetically linked to a cVDPV2 in an AFP case in DR Congo in May 2022 and the same as the positive ES reported in recent weeks in Botswana. (See Poliomyelitis update (42): WPV AFP (Mozambique), cVDPV1 AFP, cVDPV2 AFP, ES 20221104.8706551).

Looking at total global case counts, 2022 has more cases of WPV1 associated AFP than identified in all of 2021, and more cases of cVDPV associated AFP than to date in 2021.

The year 2022 to date continues to be a good year for the viruses but not for eradication efforts.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One can see cases of cVDPV in a band across Africa and in Israel, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; cVDPV1 in DR Congo, Madagascar, Mozambique and Yemen; and WPV1 in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Malawi, and Mozambique. - Mod.MPP]

Citation: O'Leary A. Polio has recently been detected in places like London, New York, Ukraine and Israel -- but what does it really mean to the global eradication effort? Int Health. 7 Nov 2022 :ihac066. doi: 10.1093/inthealth/ihac066. Epub ahead of print. PMID: 36342124.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recent high-profile detections of poliovirus transmission in the UK, the USA, Ukraine and Israel are, of course, concerning, and such transmission events must be (and are being) appropriately managed. But what do they mean for the global effort to eradicate polio? They are clear warnings, giving us a glimpse of what would happen were we not to achieve our shared goal of global polio eradication.

From a purely programmatic perspective, such events are not the 'make or break' factors in the global eradication effort. Such events will continue until we achieve global eradication.

The key to polio eradication is to rapidly interrupt the remaining chains of wild poliovirus transmission in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Finishing all transmission of wild poliovirus here -- the last global endemic reservoir of wild poliovirus -- is the 1st crucial step in ensuring a world free of poliovirus. And while it is crucial to manage the risks associated with events like those in New York, London, Israel, Ukraine and other places, we must firmly keep our programmatic focus on the number one epidemiological priority: Pakistan and Afghanistan.

In these countries good progress is being made. Pakistan remains the more significant challenge from a purely technical point of view, simply because it is the larger of the 2 countries from a population-size point of view (poliovirus is a virus that thrives in larger populations). Afghanistan had previously eradicated its wild poliovirus and its fate will always be closely tied to Pakistan's efforts given frequent travel across their shared borders.

In both countries, wild poliovirus transmission has been extremely low for the past 12-24 mo. But we are already seeing how fragile this progress is. This year [2022] in Pakistan, an outbreak has emerged in 1 province, and the risk of infectious diseases such as polio spreading is of course increased by the recent devastating floods. Nevertheless, as there is high-level political commitment in Pakistan, the country is intensifying efforts to urgently stop this outbreak, while ring-fencing it in an attempt to prevent it from spreading to other areas.

In reality, now, we have perhaps the best opportunity ever to finish the job of eradicating polio, even with the detection of poliovirus in places where polio was considered a thing of the past. We have a unique window of opportunity -- but we must use it because it will not remain open forever.

Failure to eradicate polio will result in the global resurgence of the disease with some models predicting that within 10 y the world would again see 10s of thousands -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands -- of new cases annually with global spread. This would result in many thousands of children again paralysed for life every single year. New York, London, Israel, Ukraine: magnified in all countries!

Economically, too, this would have a devastating impact. The economic benefits of a polio-free world would be lost, and the financial burden of outbreak response, global surveillance and rehabilitation would eclipse the costs of achieving eradication. Until polio is eradicated, all countries are at risk of polio re-emergence.

Tremendous efforts are underway, with support from critical partners. Political, community and medical leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan are sparing no effort to find the remaining 'zero-dose' children (i.e. those who have never been reached and immunised).

Rotary International and Rotarians worldwide are leading the way, raising funds and engaging with leadership in polio-affected and donor countries. Political fora, ranging from the G7, G20 and Commonwealth to the World Health Assembly, all recognise the opportunity to finish the job.

We know what it takes to eradicate polio. We have the strategies. We have effective vaccination and surveillance tools. From a biological and technical point of view, the feasibility of achieving eradication is wholly established. In October 2022, a global pledging moment in Berlin, generously co-hosted by the Government of Germany, saw international donors and partners come together to publicly recommit to the effort. It was a clear signal of global intent that we can now all further build on, to ensure all remaining resources to achieve success are urgently mobilized.

There is nothing more sustainable and equitable than the eradication of a disease. Ali Maalin was the last natural human smallpox case in the world in 1977 in Somalia. Three years later, the world was certified as free of smallpox in 1980. In the 77 y preceding Ali Maalin's diagnosis in the 20th century, smallpox caused more than 500 million deaths. Those are more deaths than were caused by all wars fought throughout human history, including World War I and World War II. But thanks to the smallpox eradication effort, no further cases of naturally occurring smallpox have occurred since then. It was an incredible achievement and one we hope to repeat with polio: that no child will ever again be infected and paralysed by any poliovirus.

It is our 'choice' to eradicate polio, or not. Let us make the right choice.

[I can't help but wonder why the cVDPVs are not considered as polio in discussions on eradication focus. There are now thousands of confirmed cases of paralytic disease globally associated with infection by a cVDPV. While WPV1 continues to circulate in Afghanistan and Pakistan, it also travels outside of those 2 countries and is currently circulating in Mozambique, along with cVDPV1 and cVDPV2. It would be interesting to see a cost benefit analysis of the impact of cVDPV globally compared with WPV1. - Mod.MPP]
