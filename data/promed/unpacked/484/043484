Some balance needs to be urgently restored to the public perception of
_Pfiesteria_. People are reported to be abstaining from eating fish or
other seafood for fear of contamination. I saw a TV news sequence here in
Europe (where I am attending a meeting) which cut from a shot of a
succulent-looking and healthy food fish to a shot of a small fish with the
strawberry-colored lesion of _Pfiesteria_. The impression left on the
viewer was that food fish are affected. According to more complete reports
such as that cited above, the parasite does not affect fish that are sold
for human consumption, only the small but abundant fish called menhaden
which are used for oil and fertiliser.
There are no reports of food fish, shellfish, lobsters or other seafood
being affected.
There are no reports that anyone who has consumed fish or seafood from the
Chesapeake Bay area has fallen ill with the symptoms of _Pfiesteria_
intoxication.
If anyone has seen such a report, we would like to know the source and the
evidence presented.
