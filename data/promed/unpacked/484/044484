A renowned American wildlife conservationist has expressed fears that
the rare chimpanzee species found in western Tanzania could become
extinct as a result of a mysterious disease that [is] decimating the
primate genus in large numbers.

The scientist, Dr Magdalena Lukasik-Braum, known for her research on
wildlife in the country, said the rare species at Mahale Mountain
National Park in Kigoma Region would become extinct if the disease is
not checked.

"The deadly disease that recently claimed scores of the rare monkey
species in Mahale Mountain National Park is still ravaging them after
5 more died. The situation is critical because the animals are
threatened with extinction. Its current population is less than 50,"
Dr Lukasik-Braum said, after concluding research on the chimpanzees.

chimpanzee a monkey -- it's an ape. - Mod.JW]

"Some of the threats to these ape populations are similar to those
affecting other wildlife in the region (East and Central Africa):
political instability in the countries where they are found, habitat
destruction and bush-meat trade," Dr Lukasik-Braum noted.

But there is an additional factor that affects apes, especially
chimpanzees, more than any other animal -- human diseases. She said
the chimpanzees are genetically so close to people that they are
susceptible to almost all germs which affect humans.

Dr Lukasik-Braum said since Tanzania is recognized worldwide for its
political stability and safety, and the chimp meat trade is
non-existent there, human diseases, especially respiratory ones, are
by far the biggest threat to habituated chimpanzees [meaning those
which are used to being studied at close quarters in their natural
habitat. - Mod.JW]

"Respiratory outbreaks occur with alarming regularity nearly every
year, usually in June/July, when large numbers of staff and visitors
enter the forest after the rainy season," she said. "Many
chimpanzees are affected and every year at least a few of them,
usually the youngest, die," she said. She explained that every few
years, exceptionally bad outbreaks kill the chimpanzees. Such was the
case with the recent deadly disease outbreak in Mahale, which claimed
as many as 12 chimpanzees, she said.

The scientific name of the rare species is not given, but the Eastern
race of _Pan troglodytes_ is ranked as vulnerable, one step above
endangered. There is no evidence in this report that the chimps died
from a human disease. However, the Mountain Gorilla Veterinary
Project, based in Ruhengeri, Rwanda, investigated 100 gorilla deaths
dating back to 1968. Respiratory diseases, including influenza A and
parainfluenza viruses, killed 24 of the animals. To reduce the risk
of human-to-ape transmission, eco-tourists who trek to see the
gorillas in the wild already have to stay at least 7 meters away, and
keep their visits to no more than an hour -- see 2005 ProMED
reference below. The transmission of scabies from humans to wild
chimpanzees has been reported from Tanzania -- see 1997 ProMED ref. below.

Infection of chimps in captivity is another matter. Human respiratory
syncytial virus (HRSV) was originally isolated as "chimpanzee coryza
virus" and only later found to be a cause of severe disease in human
infants -- see ref.1. Pneumonia and tuberculosis are reported to be
problems in non-human primate colonies -- see ref.2. Pneumococcal
illness following parainfluenza type 3 virus infection has been seen
in chimpanzees in a primate rehabilitation unit -- see ref.3. All
alphaherpesviruses isolated from apes up to 1980 were proven to be
human viruses -- herpes simplex virus types 1 (HSV1) and 2 (HSV2) or
varicella-zoster virus -- see ref. 4 & 5. There is an anecdotal
report of measles in chimps.

However, all these infections are in apes that have had close contact
with humans over prolonged periods, quite unlike the situation in the
open in this National Park, assuming they take the same precautions
as for the gorillas in Rwanda. There is, of course, the possibility
that the researchers in this park may take sick or wounded chimps
into their camp for medical treatment, bringing them into much
closer contact with humans.
