The Health Department has been urged to investigate and establish the
seriousness of the Japanese Encephalitis outbreak, a disease caused by a
virus passed to humans from animals through mosquitoes.
Member for Alotau and Minister for Treasury and Corporate Affairs, Iairo
Lasare, yesterday expressed concern at reports that there have been six
deaths so far with ten others contracting the disease in the Esa'ala
district of Milne Bay province.
According to the Senior Specialist Medical Officer and National
Epidemiologist, Disease Control, Dr James Wangi, who headed the
investigation carried out at the end of last year, the disease is common
among domestic animals including pigs and dogs, and is transmitted through
mosquito bites.
Dr. Wangi expressed concern that the disease is non-curable but could be
prevented by a vaccine, known as Japanese Vaccine (Je-Vex); however, he
said there is none available in the country at present to prevent it from
spreading.
He said this was the first case where an investigation was conducted and it
was medically proven from blood samples of pigs, dogs, chicken, sick people
with visible signs of the disease and their relatives, adding that it was
possible for the disease to have existed in other parts of the country with
similar signs, symptoms and environment, but had not been investigated and
proved medically.
Meanwhile, a similar situation was reported in East Sepik province last
month where carcasses of dead animals were seen floating on the Sepik River.
Dr. Richard Laki, who collected blood samples from the dead animals,
suspected a similar case but said the results would be made available after
they were proven with biological evidence that Japanese Encephalitis was
the cause of the deaths.
