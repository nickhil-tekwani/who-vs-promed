Heroin death toll still rising
------------------------------

A mystery illness affecting heroin users in the Glasgow area has claimed
another life. A male user died in the city's Stobhill Hospital on Thursday
taking the death toll to 11 in the last two weeks.

On Wednesday it was revealed British military are investigating whether
anthrax, the deadly bug used in germ warfare, could be to blame for the
deaths. But with two addicts still seriously ill in hospital in Glasgow the
health board is playing down any link to anthrax. A spokeswoman said no
more cases of the illness had been identified and she said the board was
also considering necrotising fasciitis, or "flesh-eating disease", as a
possible cause.
