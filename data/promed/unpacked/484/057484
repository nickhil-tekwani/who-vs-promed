The number of confirmed mumps cases at Syracuse University [SU] has risen to 24. There are also 27 probable cases.

Probable cases are students who have symptoms, appear to have the disease, but are awaiting confirmatory lab tests.

The outbreak at SU began in August 2017. Some of the students with confirmed cases of mumps are no longer contagious and have made a full recovery.

SU is isolating students who have mumps to stop the spread of the disease on campus. Some are staying in hotels.

Most of the students at SU who contracted mumps had been vaccinated against the disease. Most schools require students to get 2 doses of the mumps vaccine.

Mumps is a serious contagious disease passed through saliva and respiratory secretions. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears or along the jaw.

Mumps outbreaks have been occurring on college campuses across the state and nation.

Some colleges with outbreaks have offered students a 3rd mumps vaccination. The extra dose helped control an outbreak at the University of Iowa during the 2015-2016 school year, according to a recent study published in the New England Journal of Medicine [see comment below - Mod.LK].

But Onondaga County Health Department officials are not recommending a 3rd dose for SU students because they say there is not enough evidence it is helpful in people who are fully vaccinated.

[Implementation of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for outbreak situations has been under discussion. The citation for the NEJM study referred to in the report above that evaluated a 3rd dose is: Cardemil CV et al. 2017. Effectiveness of a Third Dose of MMR Vaccine for Mumps Outbreak Control. N Engl J Med 2017; 377:947-956 September 7, 2017 DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1703309. [edited]:

Abstract
---------
"Background. The effect of a 3rd dose of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine in stemming a mumps outbreak is unknown. During an outbreak among vaccinated students at the University of Iowa, health officials implemented a widespread MMR vaccine campaign. We evaluated the effectiveness of a 3rd dose for outbreak control and assessed for waning immunity."

"Conclusions. Students who had received a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine had a lower risk of mumps than did those who had received 2 doses, after adjustment for the number of years since the 2nd dose. Students who had received a 2nd dose of MMR vaccine 13 years or more before the outbreak had an increased risk of mumps. These findings suggest that the campaign to administer a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine improved mumps outbreak control and that waning immunity probably contributed to propagation of the outbreak."

Public health officials in Auckland have told its 3 district health boards the region urgently needs a large-scale campaign to eliminate mumps.

There are now 637 confirmed or probable cases in the city, up from 300 in early September 2017.

Though people usually recover well from the viral disease, there can be serious complications. So far, about 35 people -- 5 percent of cases -- have been hospitalised.

In a paper released under the Official Information Act, the Auckland Regional Public Health Service urged the DHBs to make catch-up doses of the mumps vaccine available to about 100 000 people who need it.

The regional health service's clinical director, Julia Peters, said offering people aged 10 to 29 a free measles, mumps and rubella vaccine would be the quickest way to end the outbreak.

When the outbreak began in January [2017], cases mainly involved people from the Pacific either visiting this country or returning to live here. But the regional health service said most cases are now locally acquired, involving people living here who lack immunity.

The most at-risk group are those aged 10-29, mainly Pacific and Maori living in poorer communities in Auckland. About 77 percent of this age group are not fully vaccinated with the MMR vaccine.

District health boards haven't decided yet whether a large-scale programme will happen. Dr Peters said it would be a major undertaking. "Doing something like that is a considerable logistical exercise, so it would require quite a lot of thought and planning if it was to go ahead. It's not just the funding. We'd need to assess the size of the at-risk population; it would need to be coordinated, staffed; we'd need to ensure the vaccination supplies, communications with the target population, and then the timing, and then how it would be rolled out."
