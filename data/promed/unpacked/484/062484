Plum trees to be culled to prevent spread of virus
--------------------------------------------------
Over 1500 plum trees infected with plum pox virus (PPV) will be cut
down in western Tokyo. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and
Fisheries (MAFF) and the Metropolitan Government have announced that
all PPV-infected plum trees in Tokyo [Prefecture] will be removed in
2010 under the Plant Protection Act.

The nation's 1st PPV infection was confirmed in Ome [Tokyo Prefecture]
in April 2009. It was the world's 1st known case of
naturally-transmitted infection. A survey revealed that 37 of 272 Ome
blocks had their plum trees infected with the virus. The same problem
was also found in a total of 9 other locations in Tokyo Prefecture.

The virus had also spread to the Ibaraki and Kanagawa Prefectures,
prompting municipalities to cut down the affected trees. "We don't
know how far the damage could spread, but the impact is significant,"
said the Japan Agriculture Cooperative. "We cannot allow the disease
to spread to other areas, so we will do our utmost to eradicate the
virus and overcome the crisis as soon as possible."

MAFF will issue the ordinance to avoid further spread of the virus. 5
cities and towns will be subject to the procedure, which requires all
the infected trees and those around them to be cut down. The order
will also prohibit planting trees in the affected areas for the
following 3 years. Authorities will embark on an investigation to
determine the trees that need to be cut down. The cull will only be
carried out with the consent of orchard owners. MAFF decided on the
large-scale culling to eradicate PPV from the country.

[_Plum pox virus_ (PPV; genus _Potyvirus_; also called Sharka virus)
is widely distributed in Europe and also present in parts of Asia,
northern Africa, and the Americas, but absent from Australia and New
Zealand. It affects species in the genus _Prunus_ and may cause up to
100 percent yield loss in stone fruit crops. Symptoms on _Prunus_
species can occur on leaves and fruit. They may include ring or line
patterns, mottling and distortion, and can lead to premature fruit
drop and shoot dieback. Infection may be symptomless in some host
species. Some hosts in other genera are also susceptible including
hops, pea, tomato, and a number of weedy annual plants. PPV isolates
have been grouped into several strains according to their serological
and molecular properties, and some strains do not infect certain
_Prunus_ species.

PPV is transmitted by a number of aphid species, mechanical
inoculation, grafting, in seed for some host species, but is not known
to be transmitted by pollen or plant-to-plant contact. The importance
of herbaceous plants in the epidemiology of PPV is still being
debated. Cuttings of stone fruit trees pose the greatest risk of
introducing the virus to a new area. Disease management is difficult
but may include control of the vector insects, removal of virus
reservoirs (as suggested above), and use of certified planting and
grafting material. Resistant stone fruit cultivars are available.

We have not been able to locate additional information on the 2009 1st
report of PPV in Japan, and particularly about the claim above that
this was 'the world's 1st known case of naturally-transmitted
infection'. We would be most grateful for any further information.
