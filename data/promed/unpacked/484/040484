Three Nebraska Men Develop Rabbit Fever
----------------------------------
Lincoln, Nebraska - Two men who mowed over a nest of rabbits, killing some
of them, and another who cleaned the mower developed a rare disease known
as rabbit fever [tularemia], authorities said.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has launched an
investigation into the incident. The disease is generally treatable with
antibiotics.
The illness is caused by a bacterium found in wild animals, particularly
rodents and rabbits. People can become infected through bites from infected
animals or infected insects [such as deer flies and the arthropod tick
-Mod. LL] , handling carcasses, eating contaminated food or, in rare cases,
inhaling the bacterium. It is not transmitted person-to-person.
The CDC became interested because one of the 3 people appears to have the
rare, inhaled form of the disease, said Lancaster County health official
Tim Timmons.
Nebraska epidemiologist Tom Safranek said Wednesday he did not know whether
the infected men were hospitalized or how they are doing now.
The United States averaged 124 cases of tularemia in 1999 and 2000,
according the CDC, and 3-4 cases a year are typical in Nebraska.
Tularemia is caused by the organism _Francisella tularensis_, a
bacteria studied widely during World War II as a biological weapon.
Depending on how the person is infected, it can cause flu-like symptoms,
skin ulcers, swollen eyes and a sore throat.

[It is vital to remember that the presence of pneumonic tularemia is not
necesarily related to the deliberate release of an aerosol of _F.
tularensis_, one of the category A biowarfare agents. Aerosols of the
organism occur in a setting such as moving lawns contaminated with the
organism as is shown in this posting and the 2 outbreaks of pneumonic
tularemia on Martha's Vineyard which occurred in gardeners and was
associated with lawn mowing. It is of note that tularemia is not naturally
endemic in this area but was introduced by hunting clubs importing rabbits
during the 1930s (1). The disease may been found in unusual locations such
as New York City where a case of fatal pneumonic tularemia occurred in the
borough of Brooklyn.
The mammals that serve as reservoirs are quite limited and include rabbits
and hares, squirrels, muskrats and beavers. Spread can also be from
contaminated water or soil as it is reasonably stable in the environment.
It is interesting to note that although the ID50 (number of organisms that
will infect 50 percent of those exposed) of the bacillus in the laboratory
is less than 100 organisms, the lung infection, unlike pneumonic plague
(another category A disease) does not transmit from
person-to-person. Antimicrobials with demonstrable clinical activity
against _F. tularensis_ include the fluorinated quinolones such as
ciprofloxacin as well as streptomycin, gentamicin and
chloramphenicol. Bioterrorism-associated tularemia may be engineered to
manifest resistance to one or more antimicrobials.
There is no licensed vaccine directed against tularemia but the so-called
LVS (live vaccine strain) is covered under an Investigational New Drug
protocol carried by the US Department of Defense. This vaccine is not new,
however, as the product was derived from strain 15 which was made available
to the USA by the USSR, surprisingly, in the midst of the Cold War (2). It
is administered by scarification via a bifurcated needle, The so-called
typhoidal (undifferentiated febrile illness with bacteremia) form of
tularemia was shown to be diminished from 5.7 to 0.27 cases per 1000
at-risk person-years (3). New vaccine technologies are being used to
produce a better defined vaccine. As an example, _F. tularensis_ membrane
antigen has been introduced into a mutant Salmonella typhimurium and mice
immunized with this transgenic vector were protected against a LVS
challenge (4).
