According to a report by the state's Epidemiological Department in
Damaturu yesterday, Yobe State recorded 322 cases of cerebrospinal
meningitis across the 17 local government areas of the state last
year, and 22 persons died from the disease. It added that 4 persons
died out of the 51 cases that were reported between January and May
this year [2011].

Reacting to the report, the Director General of the Yobe State Health
Care Management Board, Alhaji Lawal Ibrahim said the board had
procured preposition drugs on measles, meningitis and other related
diseases and that they had already been distributed to the 6
epidemiological zonal offices in the state.

He said that government has also embarked on a campaign against
overcrowding, personal and environmental hygiene, saying those were
preventive measures against disease outbreak in the state.

[Although the above news release does not specify the microbial cause
of the meningitis outbreak in Nigeria, the sub-Saharan region of
Africa is plagued yearly by large epidemics of meningococcal
meningitis. This region, known as the "Meningitis Belt," stretches
from the east to the west coast of Africa, and includes Nigeria, as
well as Burkina Faso, Benin, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Ethiopia, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Niger, Sudan, Togo, and
Uganda
(http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm). The
meningitis outbreaks occur in the dry season (December to June), and
every 8-12 years large outbreaks occur
(http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx). Attack rates
during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from 100 to 800 per
100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates as
high as 1000 per 100 000 (World Health Organization: Meningococcal
meningitis fact sheet:
http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf).

Epidemic thresholds are used to confirm the emergence of an epidemic
in order to step up control measures, that is, mass vaccination and
appropriate case management. For definitions of epidemic thresholds,
see
http://www.who.int/disasters/repo/6618.doc.

To control an outbreak, WHO recommends mass vaccination with the
appropriate meningococcal vaccine in every involved district in an
attempt to induce herd immunity, whereby transmission is blocked when
a critical percentage of the population has been vaccinated (see
http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs141/en/). In 2009,
meningococcal serogroups A and W135 were involved in outbreaks in
Nigeria (see ProMED mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Nigeria (03) 20090509.1731). These serogroups cause meningitis that is potentially
vaccine-preventable. However, in 2010, a new strain (serogroup X) of
meningococcal meningitis emerged in Burkina Faso that led to huge
outbreaks in that country, with 46 percent (6/13) of the regions in
the country being at epidemic level. Serogroup X is one of those for
which no vaccine exists. Niger, which borders the Yobe State of
Nigeria, also experienced cases due to serogroup X in 2010 and
experienced an epidemic of meningitis due to this strain in 2006 (see
ProMED-mail post Meningitis, meningococcal - Africa (02): WHO
meningitis region. 20100426.1343)

In addition, _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ is a pathogen also known to
cause outbreaks of meningitis in the African "meningitis" region (see
ProMED-mail post Meningitis, pneumococcal - Africa: WHO meningitis
region 20100213.0507).

Yobe State is located in northeastern Nigeria that borders on Niger.
Damaturu is the capital of Yobe State, which has a population of
88,014 at the 2006 census (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damaturu).
