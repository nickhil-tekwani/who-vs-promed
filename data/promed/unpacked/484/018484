The foot-and-mouth virus [FMD virus] in Bulgaria is gaining new
ground with confirmation that another village in the country contains
contaminated animals, Bulgarian media reports said on 17 Jan 2011.

Blood samples from farm animals in the village of Rezovo, Bourgas
have proven positive, the National Veterinary Service said. The
slaughter of the animals will commence later on 17 Jan 2011.

"The outbreak of FMD in the village of Kosti was suppressed by
drastic measures implemented by the authorities, and the same will be
applied here in Rezovo," veterinary service director Dr Yordan Voinov told bTV.

Rezovo's 90 cows, 60 sheep, 50 goats and 50 pigs will be killed and
the area subjected to a 3-month quarantine. Prime Minister Boiko
Borissov and Agriculture Minister Miroslav Naidenov have repeatedly
said that farmers will receive 100 per cent compensation for their livestock.

[Should the need arise for FMD vaccination in Bulgaria, the vaccine
applied would most probably be similar to the vaccine used in Turkey
against the same serotype O strain. The vaccine applied in Turkey for
mass vaccinations is trivalent (O, A and Asia1). Its O component
constitutes 2 complementary vaccine strains: O Manisa (the most known
and widely used O vaccine strain) and O-3039. A 3rd strain, O Geshur,
is included in vaccines applied routinely in some other Middle East
countries (e.g. Israel).

During recent years, 2 serotypes have, reportedly, been circulating
in Turkey, namely O and A. From a reliable source, we are informed
that FMD has recently affected some cattle in Eastern Turkey in spite
of their vaccination (with a locally produced trivalent vaccine). The
most likely reasons for such a phenomenon are:

1. Reduced/deficient efficacy of the vaccine.
2. Some failure in the performance of the vaccination procedures.
3. The appearance/introduction of a new strain/serotype against which
the trivalent vaccine does not confer protection.

In this respect, we draw subscribers' attention to our RFI of 29 Dec
2010 (archived 20101229.4585). The said post included the following comment:

"It will be of importance, for Iraq and for the region, to identify
the FMD virus strain(s) currently circulating in Iraq. Are they
similar to the one(s) in Turkey, Iran, or elsewhere in the Middle
East? Have samples been sent to WRLFMD? On top of serotypes A and O,
serotypes Asia-1 and SAT-2 deserve to be taken into consideration.
FMDV Asia-1 was identified in Bahrain as recently as 2009, and
previously in Iran (2004) and Turkey (2000). FMDV SAT-2 was
identified in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 2000." - Mod.AS]
