3 cases of plague reported in west Kazakhstan in Mangistausk region
---------------------------------------------------------
According to the chief sanitary physician of the Republic, first deputy
minister of Health Care, Anatoliy Belonog, the diagnosis was confirmed
by serology. He said that they are waiting for the results of bacteriologic
analysis.

He also reported that the number of people found who had contact with
the plague patients had increased to 130. They are all now hospitalized to
prevent spread of infection. The inhabitants of Jangildi & Tauchik
villages took part in camel slaughter last week, which is the possible
source of the disease. Slaughter and further sale of 180 kg of meat was
done without the required veterinary confirmation.

Meanwhile, according to Dr. Belonog, 50 kg of meat has already been
discovered and withdrawn. Preventive measures are being taken to stop
the spread of plague among the population. There are about 320 000
people in the Mangistausk region. An epizootic of plague has been
discovered among rodents this year [2003].

5 men were hospitalized in the Mangistausk region of Kazakhstan with
suspected plague. They had eaten camel meat. 3 of them felt ill on the
third day and were admitted to hospital with a preliminary diagnosis of
plague. For confirmation of the diagnosis, Kazakhstan Ministry of Health
Care staff arrived in the Mangistausk region.

According to "RIA" News, Albert Askarov, chief of the Sanitary
Epidemiology Surveillance Department of Kazakhstan, said 91 people
were hospitalized for preventive investigation. All those hospitalized had
had contact with the 5 ill patients. At present the hospital and Tauchik
village are under the control of regional police.

According to the Kazakhstan Ministry of Health, the last confirmed cases
of plague were registered in Kazakhstan in 2001[see ref. below].

[Plague is enzootic in wild rodents in central & southeast Asia, and
camels coming into contact with them become infected. Plague is easily
treated with tetracycline or chloramphenicol; contacts, including medical
personnel, should be given the antibiotic in 4 daily doses for one week
after contact ceases. The hospitalization of contacts is presumably
designed to ensure adherence to that regime, & prevent further spread.
The use of the police to control epidemics is a common practice in the
countries of the NIS/CIS (former USSR). - Mod.JW]
