affected by _P. piscida_, and would be toxic if eaten."

No evidence for this last clause. That all sorts of seafood can be
affected in the lab is indisputable. That some seafood is affected in
nature is also indisputable. But it is too big a leap for the last part,
and this critter (along with its cousins - we appear to be dealing with 2
genera and 4 distinct species) make a different set of exotoxins than we
have seen with other dinoflagellates. The ingestion route, common to the
others, is not the presumed pathway here. And there are NO CASES, after
looking for 3 plus years here in North Carolina. Maryland has some
suspicious cases of "cognitive deficit - short term memory loss" but their
data (Glenn Morris - copied here) are yet inconclusive and the subject of a
CDC meeting next Monday and
Tuesday.

If you want what I have written (reams) I can send it. But you need to
retract that "would be toxic" phrase. The easiest and most prudent fix is
to say "could be toxic" and that is what we are saying. FDA is working on
the toxicity and is expecting to show no toxicity upon consumption, for
many technical reasons.
[Many thanks, Stan, for this contribution to defusing the "Pfiesteria
hysteria." I gladly retract "would be toxic" - Jack
