After a small outbreak of bird flu among humans, vaccination has
become available for schoolchildren in Corwen. It is the mild H7N2
form of the virus, not the more virulent H5N1, which has infected an
11-year-old, and classmates have been urged to get vaccinated to
protect themselves from infection. [There is no specific H7N2 vaccine
licensed for human use - Mod.CP]
Pupils at Ysgol Henllan, Denbigshire will be treated with Tamiflu to
prevent the bird flu from spreading. Dr. Brendan Manson from the
NPHS, said, "This is an unusual step for us to take, because the risk
of the infection being passed from the child to other pupils is so
small. However, this particular virus usually only affects birds and
is relatively unknown in humans. Its clinical characteristics have
not been fully defined. It is very rare to see this particular flu
virus, so we are taking every reasonable precaution to eliminate it
from the community."
Recently, 4 people have tested positive for the H7N2 bird flu
[virus], and another 11 have shown symptoms in Wales.
The Welsh government released a statement, saying, "For this reason,
the NPHS is contacting every individual who has been in close contact
with the people who are cases. People identified as contacts are
being offered medication [Tamiflu] to reduce the severity of any
impact from the infection."
The outbreak has so far been traced back to chickens purchased at
Chelford Market, Cheshire.

Children at a primary school are being offered anti-bird flu
treatment, as a pupil is thought to have the virus. The year 5 pupil
at Ysgol Henllan, Denbighshire, is linked to a smallholding near
Corwen, Conwy, where a mild form of the virus was found. Officials
said 9-11-year-olds in years 5 and 6 were being offered Tamiflu to
protect them from infection.
Four people have tested positive for bird flu, and 11 have shown
flu-like symptoms, but no one is seriously ill.
The child who is believed to have the virus is said to be responding
to treatment at home. Twelve children and 2 teachers from the school
have been identified as having been in prolonged close contact with
the pupil on days when there was a "small risk" of the child being
infectious. Only these children and staff have been offered Tamiflu,
an antiviral medication which reduces the severity of any impact of
the infection.
The parents of each child are being contacted by staff at the
National Public Health Service for Wales (NPHS). Dr Brendan Mason
from the NPHS, said: "This is an unusual step for us to take because
the risk of the infection being passed from the child to other pupils
is so small.
"However, this particular virus usually only affects birds and is
relatively unknown in humans. Its clinical characteristics have not
been fully defined. It is very rare to see this particular flu virus,
so we are taking every reasonable precaution to eliminate it from the
community."
Dr Mason said the NPHS was contacting all parents by letter to invite
them to meet officials at 1700 BST on Monday and Tuesday [28-29 May
2007]. "From a public health perspective, the school will be safe to
reopen as normal after the half term break. The risk of avian flu to
the public is low."
Officials have now traced 36 people in total who may have been in
contact with the disease, although only 11 of these have shown
flu-like symptoms.
The confirmed case involved a smallholding at Llanfihangel Glyn
Myfyr, Conwy. Owners Tony Williams and Barbara Cowling, who have
tested negative for the virus, called in a vet after their Rhode
Island Red chickens began to die. They bought the chickens at
Chelford Market at Macclesfield, Cheshire, some 70 miles (112 km)
away, on 7 May 2007. A total of 30 chickens from the smallholding
have now been slaughtered after 15 birds died. Officials have
stressed that the disease found at the Conwy farm was the H7N2 strain
of bird flu, not the more virulent H5N1.
The 2nd possible case emerged on Saturday [26 May 2007] about 35
miles (56 km) away at a farm on the outskirts of Efailnewydd, near
Pwllheli. It has also been linked to the market.
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) wants
to hear from anyone -- who has not already been contacted -- who
purchased from or supplied to Chelford Market, Cheshire on Mon 7 May
2007 or any poultry keeper who visited the market on that day whose
birds have subsequently become ill. They are asked to contact their
local animal health office or the DEFRA helpline at 08459 335577.
Lines are open between 0900 - 1700 BST 7 days a week.

Cases of the H7 flu virus have been identified following the
discovery of avian flu at a smallholding near Corwen in North Wales.
The latest update can be found here.
The illness people are experiencing is, for the most part, not
serious. No one is seriously ill. Preliminary investigations indicate
that we cannot exclude person-to-person spread having occurred in
this outbreak. Person-to-person spread would be very unusual, but
limited spread of this type has been seen elsewhere in the past in
some cases of bird flu. There is no laboratory confirmation. As a
precautionary measure, the NPHS is continuing to offer people who
have had contact with individuals with this illness antiviral
medication to minimize the risk of spread.
Experience of this particular bird flu virus in humans is limited, so
we are actively managing the public health response. The risk to the
health of the general public is assessed to be low.
By 3:00 pm yesterday, Sun 27 May 2007, 12 avian flu contacts had been
identified who have or have had symptoms of a flu-like illness or
conjunctivitis. No one is seriously ill. The National Public Health
Service for Wales (NPHS) has identified 142 people who may have had
contact with the avian flu:
* 47 in the household setting
* 14 in school
* 81 in the workplace setting
The list is constantly changing as possible contacts are added to or
taken off the database. Contacts are added if contact was possible.
They are taken off if detailed questioning shows that there was no contact.
The National Public Health Service (NPHS) is using the following
definitions of cases and contacts:
A case is an individual with influenza-like illness (fever above 38
C, aches and pains, cough/head cold, sore throat or conjunctivitis)
who has been in contact with affected premises or with known infected
poultry (handling/within one metre) or close contact with another human case.
A contact is defined as an individual who has been in contact with
affected premises or with known infected poultry (handling/within one
meter) or has had close contact with another person with confirmed or
presumptive avian influenza).
The National Public Health Service for Wales (NPHS) has received
microbiological test results from 9 people in Wales so far. These are
from swabs taken from the nose and throat and eyes. They have been
tested for the influenza A viruses, including the H7 subtype that has
been isolated from the affected poultry. Two tests have been reported
as positive for H7 subtype.
Definition of a case of avian flu relies as much on clinical symptoms
as with a history of contact with infected birds or another human
case. For this reason, the NPHS is contacting every individual who
has been in close contact with the people who are cases. People
identified as contacts are being offered medication to reduce the
severity of any impact from the infection. The NPHS is continuing to
investigate and identify potential contacts today.

[There is no specific H7N2 vaccine for use in humans, and the current
formulation of seasonal human influenza vaccine against H1N1 and H3N2
is unlikely to have any protective effect. The neuraminidase
inhibitor Tamiflu, on the other hand, should be protective if
administered early. - Mod.CP]
