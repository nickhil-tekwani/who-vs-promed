The state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) is investigating the deaths of wildlife caused by Type E botulism on the shores of Lake Ontario in Oswego, Jefferson and Wayne counties. DEC said it will be confirming with the state Department of Health that botulism was the cause of the deaths.

Botulism is caused by the toxin _Clostridium botulinum_, a bacterium that may grow in decomposing algae and other organic matter close to mussel beds.

Infected wildlife could threaten other animals and humans because the disease remains in carcasses, which can cause additional toxin growth. DEC is advising people to bury the wildlife if possible and to use rubber or plastic gloves when handling dead wildlife.

DEC said hunters and anglers should steer clear of birds or fish exhibiting abnormal behavior as they could be infected. Discovery of infected animals should be reported to DEC's offices in Watertown at 785-2261, Cape Vincent at 654-2147 or Syracuse at 426-7400.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria, _Clostridium botulinum_. This bacterium is widespread in soil and requires warm temperatures, a protein source and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of _C. botulinum_; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E.

Birds either ingest the toxin directly or may eat invertebrates (e.g. chironomids, fly larvae) containing the toxin. Invertebrates are not affected by the toxin and store it in their body. A cycle develops in a botulism outbreak when fly larvae (maggots), feed on animal carcasses and ingest toxin. Ducks and other birds that consume toxin-laden maggots can develop botulism after eating as few as 3 or 4 maggots.

Healthy birds, affected birds, and dead birds in various stages of decay are commonly found in the same area. The toxin affects the nervous system by preventing impulse transmission to muscles. Birds are unable to use their wings and legs normally or control the third eyelid, neck muscles, and other muscles. Birds with paralyzed neck muscles cannot hold their heads up and often drown. Death can also result from water deprivation, electrolyte imbalance, respiratory failure, or predation.

Prompt removal and proper disposal of carcasses by burial or burning (in accordance with applicable ordinances) is highly effective in removing toxin and maggot sources from the environment. If possible, avoid altering water depth by flooding or drawing down water levels during hot weather. This may increase invertebrate and fish die-offs, a protein source for the bacteria.

Providing mildly affected birds with fresh water, shade and protection from predators may help them recover from the intoxication. Botulism antitoxin is available but requires special handling and must be given early in the intoxication. Birds that survive a botulism outbreak are NOT immune to botulism toxin.
