The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural and Development (MDARD) has confirmed chronic wasting disease (CWD) in 3 white-tailed deer from a Newaygo County deer farm. All 3 deer were 4.5 years old. The samples were submitted for routine testing as part of the state's CWD surveillance program for farmed deer.

To date, CWD has not been detected in free-ranging deer in Newaygo County. As part of MDARD's disease response, an investigation will be conducted to rule out exposure of any other farmed deer.

"Chronic wasting disease is a serious disease affecting both farmed and free-ranging deer," said state veterinarian Nora Wineland, DVM. "MDARD and the Michigan Department of Natural Resources work together, in partnership with the state's deer farmers, to ensure the protection of all of Michigan's deer."

Since 2008, CWD has been detected in 4 additional privately owned cervid facilities from Kent, Mecosta, and Montcalm counties. The deer farm in Newaygo County is the 5th Michigan farm in which CWD has been detected.

Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks [FWP] confirmed Friday [17 Jan 2020] that a 2nd moose tested positive for chronic wasting disease in Montana.

Officials say a hunter harvested the bull moose during the last week of general hunting season near Fawn Creek southeast of Libby, [Lincoln County].

FWP said the following in a press release:

A 2nd moose has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD) in northwest Montana.

A hunter harvested the bull moose during the last week of the general hunting season near Fawn Creek southeast of Libby. The moose was harvested within the Libby CWD Management Zone near the southeastern boundary.

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks collected the sample from the moose 1 Dec [2019] at the Libby Sampling Station on US Highway 2 and submitted it for testing to the Veterinary Diagnostic Lab at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, Colorado. The lab identified it to be suspected of CWD infection on 14 Jan 2020 and confirmed the positive detection 17 Jan 2020 with a 2nd test.

CWD was 1st detected in the Libby area in the spring of 2019 after a white-tailed deer tested positive. FWP established the Libby CWD Management Zone, spanning a 10-mile [16.1 km] radius around town, and began surveillance efforts to identify the prevalence and distribution of the disease. Surveillance efforts included sampling road-killed and symptomatic animals, deer trapped in the urban center of town, and hunter harvests of deer, elk and moose inside the CWD Management Zone. More than 950 samples were collected and tested inside the Management Zone.

To date, 61 white-tailed deer, 2 moose, and one mule deer have tested positive for CWD in the Libby area. The 1st moose to test positive was harvested approximately half a mile [0.8 km] outside the northwest corner of the Libby CWD Management Zone in late October [2019]. The rest of the positives have all occurred within the Management Zone, and a majority were near the urban center of town.

The estimated prevalence of CWD in the Libby urban area, identified as the Libby Survey Area, is approximately 13%. In the greater Libby CWD Management Zone, the estimated prevalence is nearly 4%.

"FWP is working with the City of Libby as it considers an urban deer management plan to reduce the density of deer in the Libby Survey Area and hopefully reduce the prevalence and spread of CWD," said FWP Region 1 wildlife manager Neil Anderson.

During the 2020 hunting season setting process, FWP is proposing an over-the-counter, either-sex, white-tailed deer B license for both the archery and general hunting seasons that would only be valid inside the Libby CWD Management Zone. This license would increase overall harvest of white-tailed deer within the Libby CWD Management Zone with the goal of reducing the spread of CWD. Public input is open until 27 Jan [2020], and the Fish and Wildlife Commission will review this proposal at its February [2020] meeting.

CWD is a fatal disease that can affect the nervous system of mule deer, white-tailed deer, elk, and moose. Transmission can most commonly occur through direct contact between cervids, as well as shed in urine, feces, saliva, blood, and antler velvet from infected cervids. Carcasses of infected cervids may serve as a source of environmental contamination as well and can infect other cervids that come into contact with that carcass.

There is no known transmission of CWD to humans or other animals, including pets or livestock. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that hunters harvesting a deer, elk, or moose from an area where CWD is known to be present have their animal tested for CWD prior to consuming the meat, and to not consume the meat if the animal tests positive.

[The deer found in Michigan represent a clear expansion of territory of this disease. The article also notes this was in farmed deer, not free-ranging animals. I am sure there will be a close look at records regarding when a deer was brought to the farm or when semen from some other location was used.

It seems a little unusual to have a 2nd moose in the same area test positive and in a relatively short period of time from the 1st moose. Both animals were sampled in 2019, but results of the 2nd moose did not come back from the laboratory until 2020. Perhaps moose are not seen often enough for us to know how rapidly or slowly the disease progresses in these animals. We don't have too many reports of CWD-positive moose. - Mod.TG
