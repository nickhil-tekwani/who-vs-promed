An outbreak of Newcastle disease (ND) due to virulent virus of Australian
origin has outbreak has occurred in a multi-aged poultry layer (egg
production) enterprise. The infected farm is a small (7500-bird) multi-cage
layer farm near Horsley Park, western Sydney, New South Wales.
Disease was first reported on 22 Oct 2002 after a 17 percent drop in egg
production was detected over the previous week. Mortalities rose from 1-2
per week to 1-2 per day. Less than 1 percent of birds were showing
neurological signs.
Virulent (ND) virus of Australian origin was confirmed by sequencing at
AAHL. The deduced amino acid sequence at the fusion (F) cleavage site was
-RRQRRF- and there was a 9-amino-acid extension at the HN gene, indicating
that the virus is identical, or almost identical, to the 1999 Mangrove
Mountain isolate of virulent ND virus of Australian origin.
Immediate action has been taken to quarantine the infected flock on 23 Oct
2002; collect the necessary epidemiological information to assist
investigations concerning the source of infection and potential for spread;
and develop a detailed emergency response plan.
Strict controls have been implemented to ensure that there is minimal risk
of disease spread from the infected property. The response will be
consistent with the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan (AUSVETPLAN) for ND
<http://www.aahc.com.au/ausvetplan/>
The most recent outbreak of ND in Australia was reported to OIE on 12 May
2002 in a poultry layer farm near Meredith in Victoria. Slaughter of all
birds on the property was completed on 24 May 2002, followed by a cleaning
and disinfection program. Following negative surveillance results,
Victorian authorities lifted all quarantine restrictions related to this
outbreak on 2 Sep 2002. The rest of Australia remains free of ND.
