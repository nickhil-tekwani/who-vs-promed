MEC [Member of the Executive Council] of Economic Development, Agriculture Environment and Rural Development, Parks Tau, has put an alert on livestock farming sectors and products processors of animal origin to be aware of the outbreak of the Foot-and-Mouth (FMD) disease in Gauteng.

The outbreak has been detected on a farm in the Randfontein area.

Tau said the disease was imported to Gauteng, and other suspicious cases are being investigated in Tarlton, Fochville, Walmansthal and Ondersterpoort.

"We would like to reassure the public that all measures are being taken by the provincial Veterinary Services to limit the spread of the disease."

"The control of such infectious viral disease is a collective responsibility of all livestock industry stakeholders," said Tau.

The department is urging all farmers to exercise caution and be vigilant for signs of symptoms on their livestock and should report to the Veterinary Services for investigation purposes.

Farmers are advised to exercise extra precaution and refrain from buying cattle, sheep, pigs and goats from sellers whose livestock health status is unknown or from FMD control areas.

"We also encourage the limit of animal movement including panic selling, people, vehicles and farming equipment between farms also play a role in the spread of FMD," said Tau.

The department said any clinical signs like salivation, blisters in the mouth, limping or hoof lesions should be reported at your nearest veterinary state office.

Adult animals usually recover from the disease but young calves, piglets and lambs usually die.

The department said the meat in Gauteng is safe to eat as FMD is strictly an animal disease that does not spread to people.

[Gauteng has become South Africa's 4th province suffering FMD in cattle. Earlier in March 2022, FMD outbreaks have been reported from the province of North West (OIE report at https://wahis.oie.int/#/report-info?reportId=51386), caused by FMDV serotype SAT-2. Most probably, the disease has been detected in cattle.

Previous outbreaks were reported from Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal. The (non-affected) 5 provinces of South Africa are Eastern Cape, Free State, Mpumalanga, Northern Cape and Western Cape (Administrative map at https://en.populationdata.net/maps/south-africa-administrative/.)

On top of local economical losses, caused by the direct and indirect effect of FMD upon the livestock (cattle, sheep, goat, pig) industry, and the accompanying animal suffering, the spread of FMD may affect the country's exports. Information on the serotype of the FMD virus involved in the new outbreaks in Gauteng is anticipated. - Mod.AS
