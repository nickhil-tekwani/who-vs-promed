U.S. researchers said Wed [11 Mar 2015] that 2 flu strains that recently began causing sporadic infections among people in Chinese mainland and Taiwan, known as H10N8 and H6N1, are still not able to infect humans easily.

Researchers from the Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) analyzed a key protein from the 2 strains and found they have not acquired changes that would cause a much-feared pandemic. However, given the versatility that these bird flu viruses have in attaching to bird cells, they "can probably mutate in different ways to jump to humans," said Ian Wilson, professor of structural biology and chair of TSRI's Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology. "So we shouldn't be complacent about our ability to predict the viral changes required to get a pandemic."

The new research, from Wilson's laboratory and the laboratory of James Paulson, acting president and CEO of TSRI, was reported in 2 papers in the U.S. journal _Cell Host & Microbe_. One paper focused on an H10N8 bird flu virus that infected and killed a 73-year-old Chinese woman from Jiangxi Province in late 2013 and reportedly caused at least 2 other deaths in that province since then. Using the genetic sequence of the virus obtained by Chinese scientists, the TSRI team produced copies in cell culture of its hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which flu viruses use to infect host cells.

Paulson's laboratory tested the ability of the human-infecting H10N8 HA protein to bind to lab-grown versions of "flu virus receptors" and found that it binds well to the receptors found on bird cells, but negligibly to those found on human cells. Wilson's laboratory used X-ray crystallography to determine the atomic-scale structure of the H10N8 HA protein, revealing how the protein binds to avian receptors and why it cannot bind well to human receptors. "This H10N8 HA protein hasn't acquired the structural changes that would allow the virus to be transmitted efficiently from human to human," said co-first author Heng Zhang, a research associate in the Wilson laboratory.

The other paper, of the HA protein from an H6N1 flu virus that caused nonfatal illness in a 20-year-old Taiwanese woman in June 2013, came to essentially the same conclusions: The viral HA had changed somewhat compared to the usual HA from bird-isolated H6N1, but still remained adapted for binding to avian, not human, receptors.

The research also showed that at the atomic scale these new bird flu HAs bind to host-cell receptors in ways not observed in studies of other bird flu viruses, implying that the mutations required for easily infecting humans may be different for different strains and thus hard to know in advance.

[H10N8
----

On 29 Jan 2014, WHO was notified by the Chinese authorities of the detection of avian influenza A (H10N8) from a case of severe pneumonia in a 55-year-old female in Jiangxi Province. She was in stable condition. She visited a local live poultry market on 4 Jan 2014 and had no exposure to similar cases before onset of symptoms. Family members and other contacts have no symptoms.

On 17 Dec 2013, WHO was officially notified by the Chinese health authorities that avian influenza A (H10N8) had been detected in 1 patient with severe pneumonia. The patient was a 73-year-old female from Jiangxi Province, China. She was hospitalized on 30 Nov 2013 and died on 6 Dec 2013. The patient visited a live bird market 4 days before date of onset. She had many underlying medical conditions (immunocompromised). The family members and other contacts had no symptoms and no other similar cases were detected in the area.

Although China has previously detected H10N8 in wild and domestic birds, this is the 1st-ever report of H10N8 isolated from a patient. Given the potentially unpredictable behaviour of influenza viruses, vigilance and close monitoring is needed. Outside of China, based on available literature, the virus had been detected in birds since 1965 in at least 6 countries (Italy, USA, Canada, South Korea, Sweden and Japan).

Human infections with influenza H10N7 subtype viruses have been previously reported from Egypt and Australia. All these patients presented with mild clinical signs and recovered.

H6N1
----

A 20-year-old Taiwanese woman was the 1st [and only reported] case confirmed to have been infected by the H6N1 avian flu virus, which has been circulating in poultry on the island. H6N1 is a low-pathogenic virus commonly found in wild and domestic birds across many continents. It appears that a unique group of H6N1 viruses with the human adaptation marker G228S have become endemic and predominant in poultry in Taiwan. As mutations accumulate, these viruses continue to evolve and increase the potential risk of human infection.

Since these 2 avian influenza viruses, H10N8 and H6N1, crossed species and infected humans, scientists have been studying what changes must occur for adaptation to human infection. This ProMED report discusses results from 2 papers just published:
