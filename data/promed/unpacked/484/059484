Typhoid outbreak in Malaysian state kills 2, sparks health scare
----------------------------------------------------------------
2 people have died and 203 people have been admitted to hospital following
a typhoid outbreak in Malaysia's north east Kelantan state that has sparked
a public health scare, reports said Thu, 21 Apr 2005.
State health director Ahmad Razin Ahmad Maher said the outbreak detected 3
weeks ago was becoming critical. He said the department had taken immediate
steps to control the disease including conducting large-scale operations at
eateries and business premises. More than 30 dirty food stalls have been
closed for 2 weeks, he said. "I hope the public will not panic with the
situation as it is under control," he was quoted as saying by the Bernama
news agency.
Ahmad Razin urged those suffering from prolonged fever, stomach upset,
fatigue, headache and loss of appetite -- early signs of typhoid fever --
to seek immediate treatment. Hospitals and health clinics in the state have
been put on alert, he said.
A 23 year old student died on 15 Apr 2005, while a 20 year old succumbed to
the disease on Mon, 18 Apr 2005, Bernama said. They both fell ill after
consuming contaminated food at an exposition held at a stadium in the state
capital. A total of 164 people remain in hospital with typhoid or suspected
typhoid. Kelantan is the poorest of Malaysia's 13 states.
