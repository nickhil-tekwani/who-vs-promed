Frigid temperatures across a large swath of the United States this week followed by warmer conditions could aid the spread of a fatal pig disease now in 22 states, affecting hundreds of thousands of pigs, a swine veterinarian said on Thursday [9 Jan 2014].

"The virus likes cold, wet and cloudy days," said Rodney Baker, a swine veterinarian at Iowa State University at Ames, Iowa, the top pork producing state in the United States.

At this time of year, the virus gets frozen on clothes and shoes, making it easy to track around and spread, Baker added.

Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDv), which causes diarrhea, vomiting and severe dehydration in hogs, has spread quickly across the U.S. hog belt since its discovery in the United States in April 2013.

California and Wyoming are the latest states to report confirmed cases of the deadly pig virus, bringing the number of states affected to 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said on Thursday [9 Jan 2014].

The number of new cases increased by 134 for the week of 29 Dec 2013, bringing the total reported cases to 2084, according to the USDA's National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN).

Earlier this week, several hog producing states experienced double digit sub zero temperatures, and forecasters now are calling for warmer temperatures as highs climb toward 30 F by the weekend.

Baker told Reuters the virus can remain viable after a single, maybe even a couple of freeze-thaw cycles. Cold weather and cloudy conditions protect the virus, but heat and sunlight will deactivate it, Baker said.

The spread of the disease has heightened scrutiny of the U.S. trucking industry as livestock transport trailers are seen as a means of transmission.

Trucks need to be washed, disinfected and heated to deactivate PEDv, hog industry health officials have said. However, if a sprayed disinfectant is not given ample time to activate before the truck is driven in freezing temperatures, the virus will not be killed and can infect the next load of pigs hauled in the trailer, Baker said.

Heating trucks after washing and using disinfectant is the best way to rid them of the virus, but they are not washed frequently due to time and expense constraints, U.S. hog industry veterinarians have said. It can take at least 2 hours and costs of upwards of USD 500 to wash, disinfect and dry a truck properly, Baker said.

Studies done at Iowa State University found temperatures as high as 155-160 degrees F for 10 minutes will kill or deactivate PEDv, Baker said [There are a number of disinfectants and viracidal products on the market. The question arises as to which, if any of the products, have been tried? Or if they have been tried, do they still require a raising of the temperature? - Mod.TG].

The virus, which is transmitted orally and through pig feces, has left the hog industry scrambling to curb its spread and has fueled concerns that hog supplies will fall in the spring and summer [2014].

There are no official figures for pigs lost to the disease, but U.S. hog industry analysts estimate one million to 4 million have died.

A virus that kills young pigs is roiling the U.S. pork industry, boosting prices in the USD 9 billion hog-futures market and threatening to create more pain for food shoppers.

The disease, which has spread to farms in 22 states, is cutting into pork supplies and prompting some traders and investors to wager that hog prices could set records this year [2014]. Lean-hog futures rose to a 7-week high a week ago and are up 6 percent since mid-December 2013.

Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, or the PED virus, appeared in the U.S. for the 1st time in April 2013 and has killed thousands of piglets since then. The virus, which causes severe diarrhea and vomiting, is fatal only to young pigs and poses no threat to human health or food safety, according to swine veterinarians. The U.S. strain is nearly identical to a version that curbed hog production in China in 2012.

The extent of the impact is unclear because farms don't have to report incidents or death totals to federal regulators.

Smithfield Foods Inc., the world's largest pork producer, and other meatpackers estimate that about 10 percent of the nation's sows, or adult female hogs, have been infected by the virus, which can spread to their offspring.

Smithfield, a unit of China's Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., said last month [December 2013] the virus could result in a loss to U.S. pig production this year [2014] of 2 to 3 million head, or up to 3 percent of the industry's total. Hormel Foods Corp., the maker of Spam, warned recently its earnings for fiscal 2014 could be affected by "potentially volatile hog costs" due to the virus.

To ward off the disease, many U.S. hog farmers are redoubling safety practices, including disinfecting equipment and workers' footwear, but many say they find it difficult to prevent.

"This is the toughest disease we've ever gone through," said Mike Brandherm, a general manager with Hitch Pork Producers, a Guymon, Oklahoma livestock producer that lost 30 000 piglets in 6 weeks in a 2013 outbreak. "It was stunning how fast the disease spread. You feel helpless."

Though outbreaks at Hitch's farms since then have been smaller, it continues to lose 500 to 600 piglets a week, Mr. Brandherm said. "We're still not back at the production levels we had prior to the disease," he said.

The hit to supplies is expected to contribute to higher bacon and pork-chop prices for U.S. consumers as well. Retail pork prices likely will set a fresh record this year [2014], breaking the nominal all-time high of USD 3.81 a pound reached in October 2013, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA projects a 2 to 3 percent increase in retail pork prices for 2014, after a gain of about one percent last year.

Mike Boero, the meat-department manager at a Piggly Wiggly grocery store in Zion, Ill., says shoppers already are talking about higher bacon prices. "It's definitely gone up more than I can afford," he said. "People are only buying it if it's on sale."

Worries about the virus have pushed hog prices higher in the past few months. But many traders said the impact on production likely won't show up in a significant way until spring and summer [2014] because the disease began to accelerate in October 2013, and piglets take around 6 months to reach slaughter weight.

That sentiment has led to a wider-than-normal disparity in the price of hogs in the front-month contract -- February [2014] -- and for contracts with later dates, according to analysts. On Friday [10 Jan 2014], February hog futures rose 0.57 cents, or 0.7 percent to 85.82 cents a pound at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Prices hit the highest levels for a front-month contract in 7 weeks on 3 Jan 2014.

The June 2013 contract, meanwhile, closed at USD 1.009 a pound, about a 15-cent premium over the February contract. Usually, the gap between the February and June hog contracts is about 12 cents, according to analysts. Prices typically are higher in the summer because hogs tend to eat less when temperatures are high, which keeps them from gaining as much weight and reduces supplies.

"The 900-pound gorilla sitting on those [later futures] contracts is the uncertainty due to PED virus," said Mike Zuzolo, president of brokerage Global Commodity Analytics & Consulting in Atchison, Kansas.

Some traders and investors are cautious about placing too much emphasis on the virus. One factor that could offset the disease's impact on output is that U.S. hog farmers are expected to expand their herds this year [2014] to take advantage of lower feed prices. The cost of corn, typically the main ingredient in livestock feed, has slid about 40 percent in the past year due to a large U.S. crop. This has sharply improved hog farmers' profit margins.

Farmers also are packing more pounds on their animals because feed is cheap, and they can capture higher prices from meatpackers for greater weights.

"I think PED is a real threat, but we're going to need to see an actual shortage of pigs hit the market for futures to rally any higher," said Craig VanDyke, an analyst with Top Third Ag Marketing, an advisory firm in Chicago. "These heavier weights can easily make up for even a 2-3 percent drop in hog numbers."

Even with the industry bracing for a smaller number of available hogs, the USDA forecasts U.S. pork production will rise 2 percent in 2014, to 23.6 billion pounds, from a year earlier, citing heavier hog weights.

Analysts note that some traders have made wrong bets in the past about how much the virus would affect supplies. For instance, traders who were expecting a big impact were surprised in the early winter to see U.S. hog supplies remain on par with a year earlier. That sent hog futures to an 8-month low on 11 Dec 2013.

A question looming over the pork industry is whether farmers seeking to expand their herds will have their plans snuffed out by the appearance of the virus in their barns.

As of the 1st week of January 2014, 2084 separate positive cases of the virus have been reported to the National Animal Health Laboratory Network, which tracks the disease. Each case may represent anywhere from one infected animal on a farm to thousands across a producer's operations. The U.S. has about 68 300 hog farms, according to the USDA. Furthermore, these cases have no clear correlation with the number of deaths caused by the disease.

The industry is trying to develop vaccines to thwart the PED virus, but so far none is in widespread use. Researchers are unsure how the virus, 1st identified in the U.K. in 1971, entered the U.S.

Phil Borgic, a hog farmer in Nokomis, Ill., said he has invested at least USD 5 million in new facilities, enhanced "biosecurity" safeguards, and new breeding animals in the past few months as he seeks to ramp up output while keeping the virus out of his herd.

Mr. Borgic spent USD 150 000 to build a station where trailers that transport his pigs to packing plants must be washed and dried. Visitors to his barns must shower and put on new clothes and boots.

"We're doing whatever we can to keep it out," the 57-year-old said in an interview earlier this month [January 2014].

On Friday [10 Jan 2014], Mr. Borgic said that he'd discovered infected piglets on his farm.

Rich Nelson, chief strategist with brokerage Allendale Inc. in McHenry, Ill., said he thinks prices for hogs this summer [2014] could break the record closing high of USD 1.0745 a pound set in August 2011. "It appears that PED virus issues are going to beat out any herd expansion in 2014," Mr. Nelson said.

[This virus is having a profound impact on hog production, and it will impact the price of food for all consumers. It is most disheartening for producers to discover this devastating virus in their production unit.

I am not hearing about or seeing much evidence of research into methods to control the virus itself. Where are the disinfection studies or the emerging vaccine studies? This virus may be new to the US, but it is not new in the swine production world. - Mod.TG
