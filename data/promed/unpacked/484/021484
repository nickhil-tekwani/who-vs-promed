Two people from 2 different municipalities of the Miarinarivo district died on 31 Oct 2015, reported Dr. Bruno Randrema Marcellin, communications manager of the Division of the Plague Ministry of Health yesterday, 11 Nov 2015.

"These individuals have died following a bubonic plague," he said. The cause of death has been confirmed by the Pasteur Institute of Madagascar, according to the report of the Ministry of Public Health. No other facts have been detected in these 2 municipalities to date.

In addition, close monitoring continues for other cases. Since August 2015, the number of victims of the plague in Madagascar continues. 20 deaths were recorded so far in 2015. Tsiroanomandidy and Moramanga are the most affected cities.

The Ministry of Public Health called for vigilance by all. Delay of treatment of the plague is fatal.

[Plague is caused by the _Yersinia pestis_ bacillus, which in Madagascar is carried by rat fleas. At the start of the rainy season, currently, rats flee the sewers of Madagascar in massive numbers and take refuge in people's cottages.

The following paragraph of this posting is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a Reemerging Disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis 1998; 4(1): 101-4; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2627662/pdf/9452403.pdf:

Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had "virtually disappeared" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health-management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form especially in the port of Mahajanga each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) [pop. 22.92 million, 2013] has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa.

The circumstances related to the deaths of these cases is not stated. Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy producing the purpura seen in the "Black Plague" and also spread to the lung causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Miarinarivo is a city in Itasy Region, in the Central Highlands of Madagascar. It is located 100 km (62 miles) from Antananarivo and is the capital of Itasy Region as well as of its district and can be found on a map of the island nation at:
