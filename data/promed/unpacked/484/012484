InVS [French Institute for Public Health Surveillance] was informed on 21 Jun 2012 of 4 cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) occurring between the 14-20 Jun 2012 in children residing in the departments of Pyrenees Atlantiques (2 children) and of Gironde (2 children).

An investigation, coordinated by the InVS in collaboration with the regional agencies of health was initiated immediately, in order to identify the source of the contamination and to take the control measures. The investigation carried out close to the case that originated the alert has allowed us to identify the consumption in the days preceding symptoms of fresh Jean Roze brand hamburgers purchased in stores of Intermarche by 3 of 4 children.

The traceability survey conducted on the hamburgers consumed by the 3 children has identified a common manufacturer in the Lot-et-Garonne. The lots of hamburgers suspected to be at the origin of these cases have been determined on the basis of the dates of purchase by the families of the sick. The hamburgers with the deadlines for consumption from 28 May to 15 Jun 2012 have thus been recalled by the manufacturer.

A press release was issued on June 23 by the society of meat developed of Estillac (47) in order to inform the consumers who have retained these hamburgers in the freezer of the need not to consume these and bring them back to point of sale where they had been purchased.

As of 3 Jul 2012, 8 cases of HUS and 4 cases of bloody diarrhea have been reported in Aquitaine and Poitou-Charentes since 28 May 2012. The dates of onset of symptoms (diarrhea) of the 8 cases of HUS were between 6 and 22 Jun 2012. 7 were residing in Aquitaine (4 in the Gironde, 1 in Landes, 2 in the Pyrenees Atlantiques), and 1 in Charente Maritime. There were 5 boys and 3 girls, aged 2.5 years to 14 years. An infection with _Escherichia coli_ O157 has been confirmed in 6 of the children. The tests are still ongoing for the other 2 children. All reported the consumption of ground beef before signs began, including 5 of hamburgers of brands distributed by the stores Intermarche or Netto.

The 4 cases of bloody diarrhea presented their 1st symptoms between 12 and 24 Jun 2012. All resided in Aquitaine (3 in the Gironde and 1 in the Pyrenees Atlantiques). There were 3 females and 1 male, aged 10 to 42 years. An infection with _E. coli_ O157 has been confirmed for 1 case by culture, the tests for the other 3 people are in progress. The 4 cases reported consumption of steak chopped of brands distributed by the stores Intermarche or Netto before the beginning of symptoms.
