This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1 (27956): Dronfield, Derbyshire, England
Date of start of the outbreak: 8 Apr 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or dated resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: fresh water
Population type: farmed
Production system: closed
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity / Mortality / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Ornamental goldfish (_Carassius auratus_) / 100 percent / 100 percent / 4450 / 450 / 450 / 4000 / 0
Affected population: a batch of 450 ornamental goldfish (pearlscale variety) imported from Hong Kong on 8 Apr 2014.
Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed in percentages]:
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Ornamental goldfish (_Carassius auratus_) / 10.11 / 10.11 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals, legal movement of animals
Epidemiological comments: a batch of 450 ornamental goldfish (pearlscale variety) were imported from Hong Kong on 8 Apr 2014, and selected for spring viremia of carp (SVC) sampling at the point of arrival in the United Kingdom. The sample consisted of 30 of the pearlscale goldfish and was taken as part of a routine official surveillance programme to monitor imported SVC susceptible fish. The fish were sampled at the point of entry to the United Kingdom, direct from the transport boxes. The remaining fish from the batch were then transported in their original packaging to the importer's premises and transferred directly into their isolation facility, where they remained until the sample test results were known. This is a standard procedure applied by the importer.

At the time of sample, the fish showed no clinical signs of disease and appeared healthy. However, the sample tested positive for SVC virus, and in parallel to this the imported goldfish began to develop clinical signs associated with disease and died while being held in the isolation facilities, within a 2 week period.

The 450 pearlscale goldfish were the only SVC susceptible species in this consignment, there were no other susceptible species on the import documentation. Furthermore, this was the 1st time the importer had sourced this particular variety from the supplier. The competent authority in the exporting country has been notified of this incident.

Statutory disease control measures were applied to the entire isolation facility as soon as SVC was suspected. An estimated total population of approximately 4000 fish was held in the importer's isolation unit alongside the affected fish, and these were consequently subject to the same disease control measures. A complete stock cull and disinfection of this entire facility took place on 25 Apr 2014 under supervision of the competent authority for aquatic animal disease control in England and Wales [Fish Health Inspectorate, Centre for Environment, Fisheries & Aquaculture Science (CEFAS)]. The extent and standard of the stock cull and disinfection met the requirements to lift the statutory disease control measures; no further action is required at this site.

A 2nd importer received goldfish from the same Hong Kong supplier during the same week; their premises are also under official surveillance and subject to disease controls on suspicion of SVC. 150 fish samples have been taken for SVC testing. It is anticipated that the testing will be completed by the middle of May [2014]. To date, there are no health problems with any of the SVC susceptible species at this 2nd importer's premise and they have not received any of the particular affected variety (pearlscales) from this supplier, at any time.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; movement control inside the country; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); tracing forward; tracing back; surveillance outside containment and/or buffer zone; official destruction of aquatic animal products; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; control of vectors; surveillance within containment and/or buffer zone; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type: Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Ornamental goldfish (_Carassius auratus_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 23 Apr 2014/ Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[According to OIE's Aquatic Manual, spring viremia of carp (SVC) is a rhabdovirus infection capable of inducing an acute haemorrhagic and contagious viremia in several carp species and of some other cyprinid and ictalurid fish species.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to chapter 2.3.8 Spring Viremia of Carp at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/aahm/current/2.3.08_SVC.pdf.

The following information was obtained from the Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI), Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), Fact Sheet on Spring Viraemia of Carp http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/Guide-SVC.pdf.

"Clinical signs vary but can include darkening of the skin, swollen eyes, abdominal swelling (dropsy), pale gills, trailing fecal casts, and protrusion of the anus. Infected fish may be lethargic, show loss of balance, and display areas of bleeding on the gills, skin, and internal organs. It is important to note that one or more of these signs may be absent at any stage of the outbreak, especially during the earliest and very late stages. SVC is usually spread through close contact between infected fish.

There is no firm evidence to suggest that the disease can be transmitted vertically through the egg. Some vectors such as the fish louse _Argulus_ spp and the fish leech _Piscicola geometra_ can also transfer the disease from diseased to healthy fish.

There is no known treatment for SVC.

As a notifiable disease in the UK, there is a legal obligation to report any suspicion of a clinical outbreak of SVC to the Fish Health Inspectorate (FHI)".

For details of how SVC is diagnosed and controlled, download CEFAS guidance on notifiable diseases in fish from the aquatic animal health movements website (Pages 15 and 16) at http://www.defra.gov.uk/aahm/files/leaflet-notifiable-diseases.pdf.

There is no indication that SVC is a threat to human health (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/spring_viremia_of_carp.pdf).

Photos on post-mortem lesions can be seen at http://library.enaca.org/Health/FieldGuide/html/svc1.htm and http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/fish_diseases/svc.html.

In relation to the epidemiological comments re the batch imported 8 Apr 2014: Hong-Kong indicated, in the most recent periodic OIE report, SVC as a disease "never reported" in the country. See the last 6-monthly report (July to December 2013) at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/semestrial/review?year=2013&semester=2&wild=0&country=HKG&this_country_code=HKG&detailed=1. - Mod CRD
