The New Straits Times has reported that there has been an increase of over
134 percent in cases of dengue during the first four months of this year
compared to the same period last year. Among the affected areas are
"squatter" sites in Cheras, Setapak, Sentul and Kepong. But Penang
continues to be the most serious center of the outbreak.
According to the newspaper, there has been considerable blame directed at
foreign and migratory workers, while the role played by garbage and litter
that is allowed to collect in residential compounds has been largely
ignored. It was announced earlier this year that construction and work
sites must implement dengue control measures before work permits can be
activated. There is currently a lack of manpower to conduct fogging
operations, and the newspaper says that there is no enforcement of the
Disease Bearing Insects Act of 1975 which was enacted to curb mosquito breeding.
