Sunday night's [18 Aug 2013] conference on Lyme and other tick-borne diseases released some new data from the CDC on the number of people affected each year by Lyme disease. Namely, it pointed to a major difference in the recorded number of people affected by the disease and the actual number: Upwards of 300 000 people appear to contract the disease annually, which is about 10 times what's typically reported to the CDC. There's always some difference in the recorded and actual numbers of a given disease, but this one is a lot bigger than we thought. Still, the new report is helpful in understanding the reality of how the disease works. Catching the disease early on is one key to treating it successfully. Reducing the raw numbers of people affected by the disease will take some comprehensive and collaborative efforts.

The new data were revealed at the 2013 International Conference on Lyme Borreliosis and Other Tick-Borne Diseases, and were based on 3 CDC studies. One large-scale study used the insurance records of 22 million Americans over 6 years to estimate Lyme disease numbers. Another study surveyed clinical labs, and the 3rd used self-reports from a sample of Americans. All 3 studies together suggested what research from 20 years ago had, too -- that actual number of Lyme disease cases occurring each year is somewhere between 3 and 12-fold higher than what's typically reported.

The disease may be not growing so quickly as you might think based on the "higher than predicted" factor -- it's simply that many more cases occur than are actually reported to the organizations that monitor it. While the difference is alarming, it helps give officials a better idea of what's actually going on out there with regard to a serious disease. According to the CDC, 96 percent of cases are reported in the following states: Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia, and Wisconsin. It does not appear to be increasing its spread far beyond these states -- again, it's just that there's a greater divide between reported numbers and actual numbers than we might have thought.

Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_, and carried by blacklegged ticks. Because rodents and deer are also an integral part of the lifecycle of the tick, combating the spread of Lyme disease is complicated, and involves a multi-leveled approach. "We know people can prevent tick bites through steps like using repellents and tick checks," said Lyle R Petersen, the director of the CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases. "Although these measures are effective, they aren't fail-proof and people don't always use them. We need to move to a broader approach to tick reduction, involving entire communities, to combat this public health problem."

The symptoms of Lyme disease within the 1st 30 days after a bite are generally a small bite, which can spread into a telltale "bulls-eye" pattern, according to the Mayo Clinic. Flu-like symptoms may also occur in this timeframe, and can include fever, chills, headache, fatigue, and body aches.

The next phase, which can occur weeks to months after exposure, may include a spreading rash and joint pain, especially in the knees, which according to the Mayo Clinic, can hop from joint to joint. Neurological symptoms are more serious, and can include meningitis -- an inflammation of the insulating layers of tissue around the brain. Bell's palsy, a type of facial paralysis that is asymmetrical -- affecting one side only -- may also occur. Muscle movement problems and numbness in the limbs are other neurological symptoms. Left untreated, Lyme disease can cause chronic Lyme arthritis (joint inflammation), long-term neurological symptoms, cognitive deficits (impaired memory function), and heart problems.

Luckily, Lyme disease is often treatable, particularly if it's caught early on. Blood tests like ELISA, PCR, and Western blot can detect Lyme antibodies, and are therefore most effective when given a few weeks after possible exposure. Because Lyme disease symptoms are fairly non-specific and overlap with a number of other neurological problems, it can be hard to identify. Treatments include oral antibiotics for early-stage Lyme disease, or intravenous antibiotics for later-stage disease.

To prevent against Lyme disease, the CDC recommends using bug repellent, checking for ticks frequently, showering after being outdoors, and contacting your doctor if you see a rash on your body or develop a fever.

While there's no need to quit your outdoor activities, it's important to keep in mind that Lyme disease is a real risk, especially in certain areas of the country. "We know that routine surveillance only gives us part of the picture, and that the true number of illnesses is much greater," said Paul Mead, the chief of epidemiology and surveillance for CDC's Lyme disease program. "This new preliminary estimate confirms that Lyme disease is a tremendous public health problem in the United States, and clearly highlights the urgent need for prevention." Taking the logical precautions to protect yourself, your family, and your pets, is a smart and critical first step.

[The news report above refers to a CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) Newsroom Press Release dated Mon 29 Aug 2013 that is available at http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2013/p0819-lyme-disease.html.

Lyme disease was first recognized as a distinct entity in 1975 after a local mother's concern prompted an epidemiologic investigation of a cluster of cases that were initially diagnosed as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in the vicinity of Old Lyme, Connecticut. The causative infectious agent, _Borrelia burgdorferi_, was recognized in 1982 and laboratory tests were subsequently developed to confirm the diagnosis. National surveillance was started in 1991 when Lyme disease was formally added to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/).

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts national surveillance for diseases on the NNDSS list that are reportable at the state level through cooperative agreements with states via the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE). States and territories under the auspices of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) determine policies regarding case definitions, reporting, confidentiality, and data release (http://www.cdc.gov/osels/ph_surveillance/nndss/nndsshis.htm).

Lyme disease is now the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the United States with almost 30 000 confirmed cases reported in 2009. The geographic distribution of cases is highly focused, with 96 percent of reported cases occurring in 13 northeastern and north-central states in 2011 (http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/index.html). The latest data from the CDC on the reported number of confirmed cases of Lyme disease by state and the District of Columbia for the years 2002 to 2011 and the incidence of confirmed cases per 100 000 population by state and the District of Columbia for the year 2011 can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/lyme/stats/chartstables/reportedcases_statelocality.html.

However, underreporting and misclassification are features common to all surveillance systems (http://www.iom.edu/~/media/Files/Activity%20Files/Disease/TickBorne/10-Disease-Surveillance-and-Case-Definitions.pdf). For reporting purposes, uniform case definitions have been developed to define the symptoms and findings, which in combination with laboratory test results, make it likely that a case truly is Lyme disease, or, when laboratory confirmation is not possible, as is often the case in erythema migrans (EM), to define a set of symptoms and findings that are characteristic only of the disease under surveillance (http://wwwn.cdc.gov/NNDSS/script/casedef.aspx?CondYrID=752&DatePub=1/1/2011%2012:00:00%20AM). Clinical data supplied by healthcare practitioners is thus very important for case confirmation.

EM is an early manifestation of Lyme disease, which occurs often before serologic tests become positive. Laboratory-based reporting will fail to capture reports of EM for which laboratory testing is not routinely performed. When healthcare providers do not take the time needed to report cases of EM, which is the most common clinical manifestation of Lyme disease, Lyme disease is grossly underreported.

Confirmation of a case of EM requires a history of exposure or, if there is no exposure history, positive laboratory evidence. Confirmation of a case with one of the late manifestations requires positive laboratory evidence. Without clinical data, confirmation of positive laboratory data is not possible. If insufficient funding is appropriated for surveillance, it may be impossible for a state health department to follow-up on thousands of laboratory reports to find out if a person had symptoms consistent with recent disease.
