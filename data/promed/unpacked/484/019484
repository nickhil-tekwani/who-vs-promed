An outbreak of _Legionella_ bacterial infections in the Lombardy region of Italy has claimed 3 lives and affected a total of 26 people so far.

Three elderly people have died in Bresso, a town 20 minutes north of Milan in the Lombardy region, from infection by _Legionella pneumophila_ bacteria, local authorities have said. "The latest data tells us that 26 people living in Bresso in the last 12-13 days have contracted the bacteria, of which 3 unfortunately have lost their lives," the local authority announced. The mayor of Bresso, Simone Cairo, stated at a press conference today [26 Jul 2018] that "cases have a prevalent but not exclusive geographical distribution" in the area. "The situation is under my control. All the authorities that had to take action have been activated," Cairo said.

A public health task force has been dispatched to take water samples from homes and the public water aqueduct in the town, Giulio Gallera, Lombardy Regional Council member for Welfare, said in a statement. Regional authorities are "constantly monitoring the situation without leaving anything to chance," he said.

In the 1st round of water checks ordered in the town, 2 samples of water have tested positive for the disease [bacteria]; one taken from the home of an infected person, and another from a public fountain, Ansa reports.

Cairo adopted a series of precautions in Bresso after the 3 deaths. All 3 victims were reportedly elderly residents of the town's historic centre.

He has so far closed 4 public fountains as well as a garden visited every day by one of the victims. After tests on public water aqueducts proved negative, he has also ordered new "tests and surveys in collaboration to test the air," and requested sanitation at the Red Cross migrant reception center, the municipal swimming pool, and the sports centre.

The situation is much worse than the last time the bacteria were detected in the region 4 years ago. Nine cases were detected between January and September 2014.

The _Legionella_ bacteria can cause illnesses ranging from a mild fever to fatal pneumonia and multiple organ failure, known as Legionnaire's disease. It lives and grows in water, including rivers, lakes, pipes, and air conditioning systems, at temperatures of 20-50 C [68-122 F], according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

Italy has the highest number of cases of _Legionella_ bacterium infections in Europe, according to the most recent annual report by the European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC). About 70 percent of European cases are detected in 4 countries: Germany, France, Italy and Spain. The number of detected cases is constantly rising across the continent, and the report says contributing factors include better surveillance, population aging, increased travel and climate change.

In Europe, Australia, and the United States, there are some 10-15 cases of _Legionella_ infection detected per million people every year.

The most frequent complications of Legionnaires' disease are respiratory failure, shock and acute kidney and multi-organ failure. There is no vaccine, and recovery always requires antibiotic treatment, according to the WHO.

[Genotyping the strains isolated from the 26 patients will help establish whether this is a common source outbreak, if the genotypes match. However, if the diagnosis of legionnaires' disease was based only on a positive urinary antigen assay, there will be no isolates for genotyping.

Molecular typing of environmental isolates of _Legionella_ can help identify the source of the outbreak, if the environmental genotype matches the genotype of the clinical isolates.

Bresso is a city with a population of 26 255 residents in 2001 in the province of Milan in the Italian region of Lombardy, located about 8 km (5 miles) north of Milan; it is the most densely populated city in Italy outside the province of Naples (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresso).
