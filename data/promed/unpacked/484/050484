CDC's "Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report": Progress Toward Measles Elimination -- Eastern Mediterranean Region, 2013-2019
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James L Goodson, senior measles scientist at the Global Immunization Division at CDC's Center for Global Health, and colleagues discuss measles immunization, surveillance activities, and progress toward measles elimination in the Eastern Mediterranean region (EMR), writing, "To accelerate progress toward measles elimination in EMR, the visibility of efforts to achieve the measles elimination goal must be raised, including the benefits of achieving measles elimination. ... To achieve vaccination coverage and equity targets that leave no one behind and accelerate progress toward measles elimination and broader [global] goals, sustained and predictable investments and careful management of the leveraging of the substantial polio eradication infrastructure and resources are critically needed."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
During 2008-2012, estimated 1st-dose coverage with measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region was 83%; reported measles cases approximately tripled, from 12 196 to 36 456, with large outbreaks in high-incidence countries.

What is added by this report?
Annual regional measles incidence increased from 33.5 per million population in 2013 to 91.2 in 2018, primarily because of large outbreaks in Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen; then decreased to 23.3 in 2019.

What are the implications for public health practice?
To achieve measles elimination, efforts are needed to increase MCV1 and MCV2 coverage, conduct high-quality supplementary immunization activities, and reach populations at high risk for not accessing immunization services or living in areas with civil strife.

WHO warns of pandemic-related measles vaccination delays
--------------------------------------------------------
More than 117 million children across 37 countries may miss out on measles vaccination, because immunization campaigns have already been delayed in 24 countries owing to COVID-19 surges, according to a statement today from the WHO and its global health partners, including the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

In a joint statement, the Measles and Rubella Initiative expressed solidarity in the fight against COVID-19 and that the battle against the pandemic requires a coordinated effort. "At the same time, we must also champion efforts to protect essential immunization services, now and for the future," it said.

In March [2020] the WHO has issued guidance to help countries sustain immunization during the pandemic, which includes temporarily pausing activities in areas where there are no active outbreaks. The agency also urges governments to do a careful risk-benefit analysis when weighing delays.

[4] Impact of delay in vaccination due to COVID-19

Fighting measles amid the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic
---------------------------------------------------------
COVID-19 (coronavirus) has paused many vaccine programs in low- and middle-income countries, causing the United Nations and global health experts to warn that over 100 million children could be at risk for measles.

Cambodia, Mexico, Nigeria, and at least 21 other countries have temporarily suspended their vaccine programs during the pandemic because children are vaccinated in large groups at markets, schools, or religious buildings, which would put families at risk of contracting COVID-19.

Robin Nandy, MD, Chief of Immunization for UNICEF, stated, "In our quest to vaccinate kids, we shouldn't contribute to the spread of COVID-19," he said. "But we don't want a country that is recovering from an outbreak of it to then be dealing with a measles or diphtheria outbreak."

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is encouraging parents in the United States to maintain vaccination appointments for their children, especially those under 2 years old.

Beate Kampmann, MD, Director of the Vaccine Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, echoed the AAP, stating, "Even in resource-rich settings there is a danger of measles raising its ugly head in the not-too-distant future, hence it is even more important to sustain routine immunizations."

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, some vaccine-hesitant parents have rethought their positions. Haley Searcy, a mother in Florida, told CNN that she previously considered vaccines to be dangerous and unnecessary, but, "Since COVID-19, I've seen firsthand what these diseases can do when they're not being fought with vaccines."

Isaac Lindenberger, whose mother refused to vaccinate him as a child, stated, "I definitely see the positive effect in anti-vaxxers that previously would not have considered vaccination. It's way harder to be in a state of denial when it comes to the objective truth of the dangers of these infectious diseases when you're experiencing a pandemic."

Some anti-vaccine advocates are maintaining their positions. Lynette Marie Barron, administrator of the anti-vaccination group Tough Love, argued that some people are now seeing her side of the debate because they are "pretty freaked out" about COVID-19 vaccine development: "Them rushing this [a vaccine] like they are... they have no idea what the effects of this are going to be."

Tennis player Novak Djokovic, the men's world no.1, expressed concerns about the possibility of being required to get a COVID-19 vaccine in order to return to professional tennis when the time comes. "Personally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn't want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel," he said.

All 50 states require some vaccines for kids to attend public schools, including diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (DTap), measles and rubella, and chickenpox.

[It is alarming that even after witnessing the morbidity and mortality that a virus can wreak unchecked by a vaccine, there are still those who continue to oppose vaccination. Perhaps the process from development of a vaccine through Phase 1,2,3 testing to approval by the FDA should be more transparent to build trust in the scientific method. - Mod.LK]

[5] Why measles deaths are surging
Date: Tue 7 Apr 2020

Why measles deaths are surging -- and coronavirus could make it worse
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The world's most contagious virus has killed thousands in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and 23 countries have suspended measles vaccination campaigns as they cope with SARS-CoV-2.

A viral outbreak has killed more than 6500 children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and is still spreading through the country. The foe isn't the feared coronavirus, which has only just reached the DRC. It's an old, familiar and underestimated adversary: measles.

Cases began to spike here in October 2018. Children became weak, feverish, and congested, with red eyes and painful sores in their mouths, all with the telltale rash of measles. "We have been running after the virus ever since," says Balcha Masresha, an epidemiologist with the World Health Organization (WHO) regional Africa office in Brazzaville in the neighbouring Republic of Congo. The situation has mushroomed into what WHO experts say might be the largest documented measles outbreak in one country since the world gained a measles vaccine in 1963 [see 'Measles cases on the rise' figure showing measles at 20 year high, at URL above. - Mod.LK]

The highly contagious measles virus continues to spread around the globe. In 2018, cases surged to an estimated 10 million worldwide, with 140 000 deaths, a 58% increase since 2016. In rich countries, scattered measles outbreaks are fueled by people refusing to vaccinate their children. But in poor countries, the problems are health systems so broken and underfunded that it is nigh-on impossible to deliver the vaccine to people who need it. The DRC's flood of cases shows why measles will keep flaring up despite efforts to control it. And the situation will only worsen with the COVID-19 pandemic: more than 20 countries have already suspended measles vaccination campaigns as healthcare workers scramble to deal with coronavirus.

The other deadly virus
----------------------
In poor countries, measles is a killer, especially in combination with malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency. Estimates are uncertain, but the death rate in developing countries hovers around 3-6%, and it can spike as high as 30% in the worst outbreaks, according to the WHO. Its victims often die of complications including pneumonia or diarrhoea and dehydration. Those who recover can be left with permanent disabilities, including blindness, hearing loss, and brain damage. The virus also impairs the immune system for months or years after infection, creating "immune amnesia" that leaves children vulnerable to other infections.

The virus is so contagious that few unvaccinated people who come into contact with it are spared its effects. Scientists define infectiousness using the 'reproduction number' -- how many people, on average, would be infected by a single person with the virus, in a population that has no immunity. For Ebola, that number is estimated at 1.5-2.5. The new coronavirus terrifying the world seems to be somewhere between 2 and 3. Measles tops the charts with a reproduction number of 12-18, which makes it the most contagious virus known. You don't need to be in the same room as an infected person to catch the virus -- it is spread by respiratory droplets that can linger in the air for hours.

Two doses of a safe and effective vaccine can prevent measles. Many children in poor countries are lucky to get a single dose, which doesn't always lead to full protection in all who receive it. Because the virus is so contagious, 92-95% of a population needs to be fully immunized to ward off outbreaks. In the DRC, only 57% of children received even one dose of measles vaccine in 2018, according to a UNICEF study, creating ideal conditions for the virus to explode.

In other countries, too, measles is a constant, simmering at low levels until the number of children susceptible to the virus builds up and it takes off [see figure at URL above: 'Large measles outbreaks' - Mod.LK]. "Pretty much name any country and you will find measles there," says Robb Linkins, a measles specialist in the global immunization division at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, and chair of the Measles & Rubella Initiative, a partnership of five organizations.

In each region, a slightly different mix of factors leads to an outbreak.

In Madagascar, a shortage of measles vaccine helped fuel an outbreak that has swept the island nation starting in 2018, causing more than 240 000 cases and 1000 deaths.

And in Ukraine, after a child died of unrelated causes following a measles jab in 2008, vaccination coverage plummeted from 95% that year to 31% in 2016, says Linkins. He says no one was surprised when, in 2017, a huge outbreak hit that has led to more than 115 000 cases.

Failure modes
-------------
The DRC has difficulties on a number of levels. The country has such a high birth rate -- 3.5 million children are born each year -- that it needs to conduct mass vaccination campaigns every 2 years. Those campaigns, in which tens of thousands of health workers fan out across this vast country, are a logistical nightmare. First, the government has to get the vaccine from the capital, Kinshasa, to remote villages that can be reached only by helicopter -- or through bloody conflict zones in the eastern part of the country.

The vaccine must be kept between 2 deg C and 8 deg C [36 deg F and 46 deg F] from the time it leaves the warehouse until it is administered -- a challenge in a tropical environment where power outages are frequent. Health workers must be trained to inject it safely, a much more difficult task than dropping liquid polio vaccine on a child's tongue. The vaccine comes as a powder, which must be reconstituted with an accompanying solution of sterile diluent and then used within 6 hours. It also comes in ten-dose vials; worried about wastage, vaccinators are sometimes hesitant to open one when just a few children show up to a session, so the children go unimmunized.

On top of that, clinics have to be open when parents can make it, and vaccinators have to be paid or they won't come, either -- a problem in a country plagued with corruption.

Health workers are stretched thin at the best of times, and the DRC has been battling Ebola, outbreaks of cholera and yellow fever -- and now the coronavirus. And measles is such a constant that it often takes lower priority than other diseases. In addition to these outbreaks, "DRC is confronted not only with political challenges but a long-running civil war," says Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist and global measles expert at the WHO in Geneva, Switzerland. "When in a firefighting mode, it is hard to sit back and say, 'Here is the long-term view of what needs to be done.

Money is a major problem. Vaccination campaigns cost around USD 1.80 per child in the DRC, says Masresha; international donors foot some of the bill, but the country is expected to pay a share. In 2010, the DRC couldn't muster the funds and cancelled a scheduled campaign. An outbreak that hit at the end of the year raged for more than 30 months. Further campaigns in 2013-14 and 2016-17 didn't reach enough children. In June 2019, after cases soared to more than 3500 a week at the start of the year, the DRC government declared an epidemic, opening the door to further international aid. By the end of the year, 18.5 million children had been vaccinated.

The WHO estimates that there have been more than 348 000 cases and 6500 deaths, but Francisco Luquero, an epidemiologist at Epicentre, the research arm of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF, also called Doctors Without Borders) in Paris, thinks the outbreak is much worse. The case count reflects only people who go to health centres, he says; many don't in the DRC. As for the mortality estimates, "they count deaths that happen right after a measles case. They should look out for the next 5 years," he says, because of immune amnesia. "The outbreak will have a profound impact on public health."

Eradication hopes
-----------------
Steve Cochi, a paediatrician and senior adviser to the CDC's global-immunization division, is especially frustrated by measles' global toll, because from a biological and technical standpoint, he says, the disease could be eradicated. Unlike Ebola, yellow fever, or (probably) the new coronavirus, it has no animal host, and a cheap and effective vaccine exists.

A new vaccine delivery system being developed by 2 teams -- one a collaboration between the CDC and the Georgia Institute of Technology and Micron Biomedical, both in Atlanta, and the other at Vaxxas, a biotech company based in Sydney, Australia -- could be a "game changer" for measles control and elimination, says Cochi, who is a fierce advocate of global eradication. The vaccine uses a technology called a microarray patch, which looks like a small round bandage with hundreds of microneedles, each carrying a small amount of live, freeze-dried vaccine. Applied with a small push, it delivers vaccine under the skin in 5 minutes.

"It is very thermostable, takes up little space, doesn't have to be reconstituted, and you don't have to worry about safety," Cochi says. But the measles patch has languished in development for lack of funding, he says, and has yet to reach clinical trials, although these are intended to begin by the end of 2020 or in early 2021. "It is totally frustrating," he says.

With campaigns cancelled and global measles-immunization rates for just one dose of vaccine stalled at 86%, the unrelenting cycle of outbreaks will continue. This DRC outbreak will subside, but Masresha says it will be a "temporary victory": the virus will rebound.
