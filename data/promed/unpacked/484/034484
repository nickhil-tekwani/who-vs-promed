Severe Outbreaks of Bunch Rots Caused by _Rhizopus stolonifer_ and
_Aspergillus niger_ on Table Grapes in Chile.
---------------------------------------
B. A. Latorre, S. C. Viertel, and I. Spadaro, Pontificia Universidad
Catolica de Chile, Casilla 306-22, Santiago, Chile. Plant Dis. 86:815, 2002;
published on-line as D-2002-0522-01N, 2002. Accepted for publication 13 May
2002.
Severe outbreaks of bunch rots (BR) have occurred recently during harvest of
table grapes (_Vitis vinifera_ L.) in Chile. Previously, BR was almost
exclusively associated with _Botrytis cinerea_ Pers.:Fr. (2,3); however, in
2000 - 2002, BR symptoms were associated with black molds and possibly
filamentous yeasts and bacteria. Cvs. Thompson Seedless, Flame Seedless,
Ruby Seedless, and Red Globe were severely affected.
Symptoms start at the pedicels as soft, watery rots that partially or
completely decay infected berries. Longitudinal cracks are produced, a black
mold usually develops along the crack fissures, and the skin of the berry
turns light gray.
Isolations on potato dextrose agar acidified with 1 N lactic acid (APDA) at
0.5 ml/liter, consistently yielded _Rhizopus stolonifer_ [RS] (Ehrenb. ex
Fr.) Vuillemin and _Aspergillus niger_ [AN] Tiegh. RS ... on APDA produced
white-to-gray aerial and nonseptate mycelia, black and globose sporangia
with elliptical collumela, one-celled, globose to oval, striated, almost
hyaline sporangiospores, rhizoids, and stolons. AN ... produced septate
mycelia. Single-celled, black, rough walled, globose conidia developed on
short chains on the second phialides at the tips of globose, upright
conidiophores.
Mature (soluble solids greater than 16 [percent]) detached berries of cv.
Thompson Seedless were inoculated with sporangiospores (ca. 10 million
spores per ml) of RS ... isolates RS6, RS52, RS73, and RS79 and conidia (ca.
100 million conidia per ml) of AN ... isolates AN12, AN69, and AN75. When
berries were aseptically punctured with a sterile hypodermic syringe prior
inoculation, 60 - 86.7 [percent] and 42.5 - 100 [percent] of berries were
infected with RS ... and AN, ... respectively, and both developed BR
symptoms (significantly different from control berries) after 48 h in humid
chambers at 23 degrees C.
Injuries were needed for infection since of noninjured berries [there was]
no infection with RS & only 23.3 [percent] were infected [with] AN. For both
pathogens, there was a significant (P less than 0.043) interaction between
isolates and the presence or absence of injuries. Both pathogens were
successfully reisolated on APDA.
Fungicide sensitivity tests were performed on detached cv. Thompson Seedless
berries challenged by placing [approximately] a 6 µl-drop of inoculum
suspension (10 million spores per ml of RS ... isolate RS52 and 100 million
spores per ml of AN ... isolate AN12) on injured berries. Pyraclostrobin
(0.067 mg/ml) mixed with nicobifen at 0.134 mg/ml (BAS 516 01 F at 0.201 mg
a.i./ml, BASF) and copper oxide at 1.2 mg/ml (Cuprodul 60 WP, Quimetal
Chile) significantly (P less than 0.01) inhibited infection (100 percent
control) by RS ... and AN ... . RS ... was completely controlled by
dicloran at 1.88 mg/ml (Botran 75 WP) and partially controlled by captan at
1.6 mg/ml (Captan 80 WP), but AN ... was not controlled by either fungicide.
To our knowledge this is the first report of RS ... causing BR of table
grape in Chile (4). The severe outbreaks may be associated with warm weather
conditions during harvest and injuries caused by birds, insects, or cultural
practices. Infection caused by RS ... or AN ... may be followed by sour rot
organisms (yeasts or bacteria), as has been suggested elsewhere (1,2).

[This is the first instance of RS as a pathogen of grapevine to be reported
on ProMED-Plant. I was surprised that neither pathogen has been reported to
any extent. Over-ripe stone fruits (cherry, peach, etc.) are especially
susceptible. These pathogens are major post-harvest pathogens that can cause
serious crop losses. Post-harvest losses can be minimized by temperatures
below 40 degrees C, by using appropriate phytosanitary procedures, and by
application of post-harvest fungicides. An additional reference is the
