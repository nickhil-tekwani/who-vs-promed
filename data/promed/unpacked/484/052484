Hundreds of Indian Children Ill After Vitamin Dose
--------------------------------------------------
DISPUR, India: A U.N.-sponsored drive to protect against blindness in
northeastern India left 700 children hospitalized and a 2-year-old girl
dead, government officials said Tuesday.
Medical workers gave the vitamin A, supplied by U.N. humanitarian agency
UNICEF, to 321 000 children up to the age of 6 to ward off blindness in the
northeastern state of Assam, state officials said. "At present there are
700 children hospitalized in different parts of the state and they are not
in a serious condition," state Health Minister Bhumidhar Burman told a
news conference. He said a 2-year-old girl died 2 hours after she was given
a dose of vitamin A Sunday, adding earlier reports up to 10 000 children
might have been affected by the concentrated vitamin A solution were
unfounded.
Vitamin A is regarded by doctors as a simple, cost-effective way of
preventing blindness among poor families, whose diets often lack vitamins.
Parents rushed the children suffering from fever, vomiting and stomach
pains to hospitals after vitamin A was given, said Dr. B.C. Kro, head of
state health services.
UNICEF regional officer Carrie Auer, speaking at a news conference in the
capital of the tea- and oil-rich state, denied allegations by police that
the vitamin A batch was contaminated. Burman said samples had been sent for
testing and the government had banned use of the vitamin A solution until
the results were known. Auer said the batch was "not contaminated but fine
as the products were manufactured in the months of June and August,"
adding the agency was "seriously looking into the incident."
In Geneva, UNICEF spokeswoman Wivina Belmonte said that the agency eagerly
awaited the results of the investigation by Assam's Health Ministry. "This
was the third round of Vitamin A administration in Assam this year. There
were no complications from the others. In past year, a total of 35 million
Indian children have received doses to prevent blindness," Belmonte told a
news briefing.
Kro said the children may have received an overdose. He said a preliminary
investigation had showed the doses were not contaminated and the expiration
date on the vitamin was 2003. "There must be something wrong with the
amount of medicine given to the children," Kro said. "A child up to the
age of one year needs only 10 milliliters (2 teaspoons) while a child
between one to 5 years requires 20 milliliters (4 teaspoons). ... These
children were probably given more."

Probe ordered into vitamin A deaths
-----------------------------------
GUWAHATI: The state government has ordered an inquiry and seized unused
vials of vitamin A following the death of at least one infant and thousands
of children below the age of 5 being taken ill. The condition of 3 children
in the Guwahati Medical College and Hospital is said to be critical.
The UNICEF-Assam campaign has been stopped and all remaining stocks have
been seized. "If required we would not hesitate to hand over the inquiry
to the CBI," said health minister Bhumidar Burman.
It is said that vitamin A dose supplied by UNICEF and a changed spoon of
bigger size might have resulted in an overdose, admitted the state health
minister Dr Bhumidar Barman.
Das [deputy commissioner, Cachar] said that a large number of people were
rushing to the district hospitals with their children, making it almost
impossible for them to [be adequately cared for]. "We have requisitioned
help from the army, medical college, and other places and admitted, at
least, 500 small children who had developed serious symptoms," he said.
In Nagaon also, it is the same story. There are more than 500 cases in the
district alone, while in Nagaon town hospital 6 children with serious
symptoms are undergoing treatment.
Talking to the press, Dr Barman said: "It is true that after vitamin A is
administered to children who are weak and suffer from malnutrition, they
can have after-effects like pain in the abdomen, vomiting and high fever."
UNICEF supplies earlier used to come with a spoon meant for the exact dose
of vitamin A. It is for the first time that the spoon size was changed to
one capable of holding 5 ml, which is 2-1/2 times more than the normal
dose. Carrie Auer, UNICEF's state representative in Kolkata, admitted that
this was for the first time that the changed spoon has been used for
administering the doses.

[As with many press reports it is difficult to figure out what is going on
in this current report. This report mentions an outbreak of a febrile
illness associated with vomiting and abdominal pain felt to be temporally
related to receipt of Vitamin A supplement in a state-wide program. There
is speculation in the article that the illness is due to a contaminated
batch of the vitamin supplement or due to an overdose administered.
Ruling out a contamination based on the recent production of the vitamin is
less than confirmatory. The latter situation postulated, an overdose, has
been a concern in evaluations of Vitamin A supplementation programs in the
field, especially for the population less than 6 months old. The second
article suggests a recent change in administration spoon, which may have
facilitated administration of a higher than recommended dose.
Vitamin A deficiency (VAD) is the leading cause of preventable blindness in
children. It has been associated with an increase in risk of disease and
death from severe infections. Measles mortality and diarrheal
disease-related mortality have been shown to be associated with VAD. In
addition, VAD is associated with night blindness in pregnant women, and
there is some evidence to suggest there may be an increased risk of
maternal mortality associated with VAD. There is a WHO-sponsored program
to combat VAD
<http://www.who.int/vaccines-diseases/en/vitamina/sitemap.shtml>
Side-effects of Vitamin A supplementation have been reported. In children
ages 6 to 59 months, loose stools, headache, irritability, fever, nausea
and vomiting in 1.5 to 7 percent of children. These side-effects disappear
within 24-48 hours without special treatment. In infants under 6 months of
age there has been an increase incidence of transient bulging fontanelle
reported in 0.5 to 10 percent of recipients.

More information on this outbreak and the outcome of the investigations
would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP
