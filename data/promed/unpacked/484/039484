At least 278 animals have died as a result of livestock disease
outbreaks that occurred in the last quarter of last year [2009]. The
affected livestock were cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys, with cattle
being the most affected in the period between October and December
2009. Statistics from the Department of Veterinary Services indicate
that of the 169 outbreaks, a total of 278 livestock died from
diseases such as anthrax, tick-borne disease, rabies, lumpy skin and black leg.

Deputy director in charge of veterinary field services Dr Chenjerayi
Njagu said this was common with the onset of rains. "Rains are
associated with an increase in animal disease vector activity, and
farmers should be on the lookout," he said.

The country recorded 11 outbreaks of anthrax in the last 3 months.
Four of them occurred in December 2009. A total of 76 cattle died
from anthrax, but the disease is now under control. Dr Njagu said
government embarked on vaccination programmes in all areas with
anthrax outbreaks, but shortage of transport and vaccines was
hampering prevention and control programmes.

He said 100 cases of tick-borne disease were reported in the last 3
months, with 69 deaths recorded. "The government runs a dipping
programme for all communal and A1 farming areas, while A2 and old
commercial farms are required by law to do their own dipping and
ensure their livestock are not tick-infested. We currently have
adequate stocks of dipping chemicals to see us through to the end of
the rainy season," Dr Njagu said.

Nine rabies outbreaks were recorded, which affected 16 dogs, all of
which died. Dr Njagu said several people were being referred to
hospitals for treatment following dog bites by animals that have not
been vaccinated for rabies. "The department is awaiting delivery of
80 000 doses of rabies [vaccine] from the Botswana Vaccine
Institute." Vaccination programmes for dogs and cats are run by the
government at subsidised rates.

Lumpy skin cases increased to 578 from 116, but only one animal died
from the disease. The disease does not normally kill livestock but
can seriously affect production.

A total of 31 outbreaks of black leg were recorded in the country,
with 116 cattle dying from the disease. Black leg is one of the major
killer diseases of cattle, and farmers are advised to vaccinate their
cattle at the beginning of winter to avoid losses.

[The Zimbabwe Ministry of Agriculture appears to be releasing
quarterly animal health reports, and, therefore, the contents are mixed.

The A1 and A2 designations go back to the colonial days when the
government veterinary service looked after the communal and marginal
farms, and the commercial and large farms effectively looked after
themselves. Under the present regime and the widespread appropriation
of the once productive commercial estates, the latter are now not as
well run, and some have been taken over by squatters. As a result,
instead of being a food exporter, Zimbabwe now has to import food
when it has the funds. In the past, all these conditions were well
and cost effectively controlled.

The government announced an ambitious anthrax vaccination scheme but
in the end involved only 1100 head, and, reading between the lines,
it has bogged down.

Canine rabies is one of the easiest diseases to control. It is to
veterinary public health what mastitis control is to the average
large animal veterinarian, an everyday problem with a straightforward
methodology. It just takes organization and adequate funding for
vaccines, transport, and personnel. Effective vaccines are available.

There are 2 vaccines for lumpy skin disease, from South Africa and
from Kenya; it is a poxvirus. A good description of the disease and
its control can be found at the following links:

Blackleg is an acute, febrile disease of cattle, usually calves, and
sheep caused by _Clostridium chauvoei_ (feseri) characterized by
emphysematous swelling, usually in the heavy muscles. It is found
worldwide. There is an effective bacterin, which is effective for
both species of livestock. In many parts of the world, multicomponent
clostridial vaccines are used with benefit. The most commonly used
clostridial vaccination in cattle is the 7-way type, which protects
against _Clostridium chauveoi_ (blackleg), _Clostridium septicum_ and
_Clostridium sordelli_ (malignant edema), _Clostridium novyi_ (black
disease), and 3 types of _Clostridium perfringens_ (enterotoxemia).
Blackleg is almost entirely preventable by vaccination. When farmers
get complacent and relax from regular annual vaccination, the disease
reappears to remind them expensively. See:

What we are seeing are some of the livestock disease implications of
the present economic problems plaguing Zimbabwe. - Mod.MHJ]
