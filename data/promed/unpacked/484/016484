Health department officials announced as of noon Sat 14 Jul 2007, a
total of 491 people reported becoming ill after eating food from the
Pars Cove Persian Cuisine booth at the Taste of Chicago festival.
That number is up from the 378 reported on the day before [13 Jul
2007].
Of the 491, 44 are laboratory-confirmed cases of salmonellosis, of
which 26 have been identified as serotype Heidelberg, a common
_Salmonella_ serotype in the USA. A total of 15 people are known to
have been hospitalized.
The source of the salmonella outbreak has not been pinpointed as
coming from food or food handlers, but only a single dish has been
tied to illnesses according to a Chicago Department of Public Health
[CDPH] news release -- hummus shirazi, a fresh herb, tomato, and
cucumber salad over a bed of hummus. As a precaution, Pars Cove has
been asked to stop serving hummus at its restaurant location.
The CDPH said this was the 1st reported salmonella outbreak at the
Taste in 20 years. The owner of Pars Cove has been cooperating with
health officials and said he was surprised by the preliminary
findings.
Chicago health officials say they have frequent inspections and rigid
food standards for all booths, but note inspectors test for
temperature, not microbes.

[The number of cases reported from this outbreak has continued to
grow from more recognition, probably not more transmission. The
festival has been over for a week.
Hummus is a creamy puree of chickpeas and tahini (sesame seed paste)
seasoned with lemon juice and garlic, and is a popular spread and dip
in Greece and throughout the Middle East. It can be garnished in many
ways, including sprinkling paprika, parsley, cumin (popular in
Egypt), pine nuts (traditional in Palestinian hummus), tomatoes,
cucumber, thinly sliced onions, sauteed mushrooms, or with whole
chickpeas over the top before drizzling with olive oil.
Whether an ingredient in the hummus was initially contaminated or if
it was adulterated after production is, as yet, unclear. - Mod.LL]
