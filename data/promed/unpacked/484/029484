The Health and Family Welfare Department, on [Sun 9 Feb 2020], conducted a vaccination drive at Madabur Estate in NR Pura taluk [Chikkamagaluru district, Karnataka], after 3 labourers in the estate were found with KFD [Kyasanur Forest disease] virus. Among those affected 2 are from Madhya Pradesh and one from Assam.

Following complaints of high fever among 4 persons in the estate, the doctors had taken blood samples and sent them for the tests on [2 Feb 2020]. "Among the 4 samples sent, 3 confirmed positive. We got the reports on [Fri 7 Feb 2020]. By then, 2 of them had returned to Madhya Pradesh. Another woman, who is from Assam, has recovered", said Manjunath HK, District Surveillance Officer, Chikkamagaluru.

The officer is trying to contact his counterparts in Madhya Pradesh so that the 2 who returned to their native State are kept under observation for a few more days. "There are no chances of infection spreading as it is a tick-borne viral disease. However, they need to be under observation for at least one more week", he said.

The Health Department staff conducted the vaccination drive at Madabur Estate, covering 39 people. Among them 4 were locals and the rest were workers from different States. In the 2nd phase, the department is planning to vaccinate all residents staying put in the 5-km [3.1 mi] radius of the estate, he said.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) is an acute febrile tickborne viral hemorrhagic illness caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), a member of the family Flaviviridae, characterized by severe muscle pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and bleeding manifestations. The disease is transmitted to humans following a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, especially a sick or recently dead monkey. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/index.html).

Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD) occurs as seasonal outbreaks during January-June (November to May according to some references) which correlates with the increased activity of the nymphs of ticks. Exposure to adult ticks and nymphs in rural or outdoor settings increases the risk of infection; herders, forest workers, farmers, and hunters are particularly at increased risk of contracting the disease. Vaccination and personal protective measures against tick bites are keys to prevent KFD. The recommended preventive measures include tick repellents, walking along clear trails, avoiding contact with weeds, and wearing full-sleeved clothes and long pants to reduce exposed skin to reduce contact with ticks and subsequent tick bites.

KFD has been endemic mainly to Karnataka State, but has been reported from other districts and states in India: Chamarajanagar District, Karnataka State; Nilgiri District, Tamil Nadu State; and Waynad District, Kerala State (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4285264/).

There is no specific treatment for KFD. Prompt symptomatic and supportive treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality. Surveillance (human, monkey, and tick), personal protection against tick bites, and vaccination are the key measures for prevention and control of KFD (https://idsp.nic.in/WriteReadData/l892s/60398414361527247979.pdf).

Vaccination with formalin-inactivated tissue-culture vaccine has been the primary strategy for controlling KFD. The strategy involves mass vaccination in areas reporting KFD activity (that is, laboratory evidence of KFD virus KFDV] in monkeys, humans, or ticks) and in villages within a 5-km [3.1 mi] radius of such areas (Directorate of Health and Family Welfare Services, Government of Karnataka, 2005 manual on Kyasanur Forest disease; unpub. data). 2 vaccine doses are administered at least 1 month apart to persons 7-65 years of age. Vaccine-induced immunity is short-lived, so the 1st booster dose of vaccine is recommended within 6-9 months after primary vaccination; thereafter, annual booster doses are recommended for 5 years after the last confirmed case in the area (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4285264). Numerous studies have reported low effectiveness (around 62-82 percent) of the KFD vaccine (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23359421]. Systematic efforts are therefore needed to increase the vaccination coverage and identify the reasons for the lower effectiveness of the vaccine in the region. - Mod.UBA
