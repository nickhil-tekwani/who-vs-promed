[ASF has been reported in 20 of the 24 provinces of Ukraine. The affected provinces are: Chernihiv, Cherkassy, Chernivtsi, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovograd, Kiev, Lugansk, Nikolayev, Odessa, Poltova, Rovno, Sumy, Ternopil, Vinnitsa, Volyn, Zhytomyr and Zakarpattia.

Although the notifications of ASF in each province have been reported to the OIE as events which have involved a defined zone of the country, given the number of affected provinces, and the continued reports of the disease in different provinces, it is clear that the disease continues spread throughout of the country. - Mod.CRD
