Rabies in Indonesia
-------------------
Rabies has been recently reported in the island of Kisar (Indonesia), about 50 km [31 mi] north of Timor Leste. This is a risk for the island of Timor Leste and West Timor, considered free of rabies.

Control projects are planned and vaccine supplies for 2013 are programmed through the central government's Ministry of Agriculture for allocation to selected provinces including Maluku and north Maluku.

[Kisar, also known as Yotowawa, is a small island in the Southwestern Moluccas in Indonesia, northern to the eastern tip of East Timor. The Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste occupies 14 874 sq/km (5743 sq mi) in the eastern part of Timor Island. The western and Indonesian portion of the island of Timor, Timor Barat, is part of the province of East Nusa Tenggara, (Indonesian: Nusa Tenggara Timur), occupying 15 850 sq/km (6120 sq mi). For a map, see http://tinyurl.com/c87zhys (zoom in).

The epidemiological form of rabies in Indonesia is 'urban', in which stray domestic dogs act as the main reservoir (compared to 'sylvatic' rabies, where the reservoir is wildlife). According to information provided during the last annual meeting of the Asian Rabies Expert Bureau (AREB) in Yogyakarta (October 2012), the virus is endemic in 24 of the nation's 33 provinces: the highest incidence was recorded in Bali, East Nusa Tenggara, North Sumatra, and North Sulawesi. The provinces currently regarded free of the disease are Bangka Belitung, Central Java, East Java, Jakarta, and Yogyakarta. A map of the provinces of Indonesia can be accessed at http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/indonesia_admin_map.htm.

Results of phylogenetic analysis indicated that rabies isolates in Indonesia formed one cluster, were of Asian lineage, and were closely related to a rabies isolate in China rather than to rabies isolates in Thailand, India, or Sri Lanka (Ref.).

During 2011 (most recent available OIE data), rabies ranked 1st among Indonesia's zoonoses in humans: 80 558 cases (= exposed humans who underwent postexposure treatment), with 157 officially reported mortalities.

Details on the cases in Kisar (dogs?) and recent statistics of dog vaccinations in Indonesia will be appreciated.
