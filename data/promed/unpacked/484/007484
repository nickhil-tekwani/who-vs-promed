Bluetongue outbreak spreads into Portugal
More than 40 farms in southern Portugal are believed to have been
infected by bluetongue disease, 8 days after the 1st case was
reported, authorities said.
The presence of the livestock virus, which is spread by midges, was
confirmed on 21 Sep 2007 in a farm in Barrancos.
Since then, another 42 farms in the region, involving more than 4300
head of cattle and sheep, are suspected to have been contaminated.
According to the Agriculture Ministry, 183 animals have been reported
sick, and 33 have died.
The virus affects cattle and sheep equally, but only the latter go on
to develop a serious form of the disease, the ministry said.
Bluetongue has been present in Portugal since the end of 2004, but
until now had only been caused by the serotype 4 strain of the virus,
for which there is a vaccine.
The outbreak at Barrancos was the serotype 1 strain, for which no
vaccine exists.
Britain is also battling an outbreak of bluetongue, becoming the
latest European Union state to be struck by the serotype 8 strain of
the virus, for which there is no vaccine.
Britain's chief vet Fred Landeg admitted Friday [28 Sep 2007] that
the disease was now "circulating" in the country, a fresh blow after
foot and mouth disease returned in August 2007.
The farming industry had been braced for bluetongue after it hit
livestock in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and northern France in
the past year after previously being confined to countries on the
warmer Mediterranean basin.

[Just as we have seen in Northern Europe with the BTV-8 outbreak, the
virus does not respect national borders. This BTV-1 has probably
spread from nearby Andalusia westward from Spain across the border to
agricultural areas of Beja. The exact site of the outbreak is in
Barrancos, a little geographic pocket of Portugal nestled next to the
Andalusian province of Huelva. We would not expect it to be contained
in this region, however. For maps of the area, see the OIE/WAHID
report referenced above or
<http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Beja,+Portugal&sa=X&oi=map&ct=title>.
Unfortunately, we have no more reason for optimism when it comes to
the control of this bluetongue serotype for this 2007 season than we
do for the BTV-8 serotype in Northern Europe (which now includes the
UK). Without an effective vaccine, which is not currently available
for either BT1 or BT8, the epidemiologic pattern has been
characterized by extensive spread. The BTV-4 virus, which has been
present in Portugal since 2004, can be controlled by vaccination as
can be BTV-2. It appears as if there will be efforts to make a
vaccine available next year (2008) for BTV-8 given the magnitude of
the outbreak, but there is much less certitude about the BTV-1
vaccine availability. It takes a long time to gear up and produce the
vaccine, so decision on serotypes for manufacture must be made
earlier rather than later. - Mod.PC]
