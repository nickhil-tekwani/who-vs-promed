Fri 2 Nov
UPDATE ON ANTHRAX SITUATION IN NEW YORK CITY
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The New York City Department of Health (DOH) announced today that test
results received from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) yesterday
confirm that an employee at the New York Post has tested positive for a
cutaneous (skin) anthrax infection. The employee has been on antibiotic
treatment and is doing well. To date, 3 individuals who work at the New
York Post have tested positive for cutaneous anthrax disease. All are
expected to make full recoveries.
The DOH was notified on 28 Oct [2001] of an employee at the New York Post
who had a nonspecific lesion that appeared on 23 Oct. As the lesion was
suggestive of a cutaneous anthrax infection, the DOH arranged to have a
biopsy and blood specimen sent to CDC. Test results have confirmed the
diagnosis. The employee started preventive [one would suspect therapeutic,
not preventive, given the clinical evidence of an infection - Man. Ed. DS]
antibiotic therapy on 28 Oct. It is believed that this individual was
exposed to the same letter containing anthrax spores that was determined to
be the source of the 2 previously announced cases at the New York Post.
The DOH also reported that environmental tests from MEETH are negative. Due
to this finding, all MEETH employees, patients and visitors who were
started on preventive antibiotic therapy will be advised to discontinue
medication. Environmental results from the residence of the woman who died
from inhalation anthrax are preliminarily negative. Further test results
from the residence are pending. Public health and law enforcement
investigators continue to explore all possible leads and associations.
To date, the DOH has reported one case of inhalation anthrax -- a 61-year
old individual who died on 31 Oct -- and 7 cases of cutaneous anthrax in
New York City, which include: 2 NBC employees, the infant child of an ABC
employee, one CBS employee, and 3 New York Post employees. Of these 7
cutaneous cases, CDC has reported 4 confirmed, and 3 suspect cases. All 7
of these individuals displayed distinct symptoms that are clinically
consistent with a cutaneous anthrax infection, most notably a boil-like
lesion that forms an ulcer with a black center.
The Health Department has an active surveillance program and has been
notifying hospitals to be vigilantly alert for suspicious illnesses. For
more information on anthrax, call 1-877-817-7621, or visit nyc.gov/health.

Anthrax Investigation Update in New Jersey
-----------------------------------------------------
HUMAN TESTING RESULTS
Following is an update on the condition of persons suspected or confirmed
with anthrax: Note that the CDC defines a confirmed case of anthrax as 1) a
clinically compatible case of cutaneous, inhalational, or gastrointestinal
illness that is laboratory confirmed by isolation of _B. anthracis_ from an
affected tissue or site or 2) other laboratory evidence of _B. anthracis_
infection based on at least 2 supportive laboratory tests. A suspected case
is defined as 1) a clinically compatible case of illness without isolation
of _B. anthracis_ and no alternative diagnosis, but with laboratory
evidence of _B. anthracis_ by one supportive laboratory test or 2) a
clinically compatible case of anthrax epidemiologically linked to a
confirmed environmental exposure, but without corroborative laboratory
evidence of _B. anthracis_ infection.

ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING RESULTS
------------------------------
Following is a listing of environmental sampling tests conducted by the New
Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services (DHSS) the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and crime scene sampling by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Facility Organization Results
1: Bellmawr Mail Distribution Center: DHSS, CDC & FBI Sampling was
conducted 31 Oct. Although not recommended, workers at the facility were
offered 10 days of antibiotics [One wonders why such a decision was made,
as current recommendations for individuals with _B. anthracis_ exposure via
the inhalational route are for 60 days of antibiotics. If there is no
significant exposure, zero days of antibiotics are needed. Perhaps
antibiotics were given pending final test results as in the building
described in (2). - Man. Ed. DS]
2: Kuser Road Office Building: DHSS, CDC & FBI Sampling was conducted 30
Oct. One FBI sample from an in-office mail bin was reported positive today.
Non-FBI samples are pending. DHSS & CDC are recommending additional
sampling and that the area around the mail bin be cleaned, and then
re-sampled. They are not recommending that the office be closed. Although
not recommended, employees have been offered antibiotics pending final test
results. [New finding as of 2 Nov]
3: Carteret Facility: DHSS and CDC All 14 samples taken 24 Oct are negative
for anthrax [_B. anthracis_] through final testing. The DHSS and CDC has
informed the facility manager to advise workers and business visitors to
stop taking antibiotics that had been given as a precautionary measure.
4: Downtown Station on Montgomery St., Trenton: FBI All 11 samples taken to
date are negative for anthrax [_B. anthracis_] through final testing.
5: Princeton Main, West Windsor: DHSS & CDC FBI 23 samples taken 27 Oct are
negative through final testing. 22 samples taken 27 Oct are negative and
one sample is positive through final testing. Additional environmental
samples were collected 30 Oct. Although not recommended, workers at the
facility were offered 10 days of antibiotics.
6: Route 130 Mail Processing Facility, Hamilton Township: DHSS, CDC & FBI
34 out of 102 samples taken are positive for anthrax [_B. anthracis_]
through final testing. The DHSS collected 20 samples on 18 Oct in the
public areas and common use -- all are negative. Also on 18 Oct, the FBI
took 23 samples (14 are positive). The DHSS and CDC team took 59 samples
(20 are positive) on 21 Oct.
7: West Trenton facility, Ewing Twp.: DHSS & CDC FBI All 22 samples taken
25 Oct are negative for anthrax [_B. anthracis_] through final testing. All
20 samples taken 19 Oct and analyzed at the United States Army Medical
Research Institute of
Infectious Disease (USAMRIID) are preliminary negative for anthrax to date.
8: West Trenton facility, Ewing Twp. (areas outside the facility) FBI All
15 samples taken Oct. 23 by the FBI are negative for anthrax [_B.
anthracis_] through final testing. Additional FBI environmental sampling
results are pending from USAMRIID. Results are expected soon.
As of today, the state laboratory has received more than 1476 environmental
samples, such as envelopes and packages, collected by law enforcement
agencies from across the state. Testing on 1,103 of those specimens has
been completed and all are negative for anthrax [_B. anthracis_]. The lab
conducts preliminary (gram/spore stain) tests and culture tests on
environmental samples and on clinical samples that meet established testing
protocols.

Anthrax spores - Kansas City
------------------------------------
Yesterday, CDC confirmed that two environmental swabs from trash bags at
the US Post Office's Stamp Fulfillment Center in Kansas City were _Bacillus
anthracis_. The samples had been collected on Sun 28 Oct by a firm under
contract to the Post Office. CDC had notified the Kansas City Health
Department of the preliminary positive results on Wednesday afternoon.
Wednesday evening a joint press conference was held by the Kansas City
Health Department and the Post Office to announce these findings.
Simultaneously Health Department staff began calling all 204 employees of
the Stamp Fulfillment Center and a nearby postal facility whose staff had
been in the Center. Health Department staff were available all night to
receive call-backs from the employees and to answer any questions. The
employees were told to report to the Health Department on Thursday morning
where they were interviewed and provided a week's supply of doxycycline.
The publicity surrounding this resulted in the identification of several
employees of other firms who had been doing contract work inside the
Fulfillment Center and they also were interviewed and provided antibiotics.
As of close of business Friday, approximately 240 persons were on
prophylaxis and only 2 employees of the Fulfillment Center were not known
to be on prophylaxis. None of the persons interviewed had any signs or
symptoms suggestive of either cutaneous or inhalational anthrax.
The Stamp Fulfillment Center is a unique Postal facility. It is located in
a 300 acre underground cave industrial complex in Kansas City, Missouri.
The facility itself is approximately 300 000 square feet. All businesses
within the complex are self-contained and have individual air handling
systems that vent to the outside. The Stamp Fulfillment Center does not
process ordinary mail. It is where all first day issue cancellations and
certain other specialty services for stamp collectors are performed.
On Fri 19 Oct, the Fulfillment Center received 25 trays of mail requests
from the Brentwood Post Office in Washington. These trays arrived sealed.
Just as workers began to open the mail, the anthrax problem at Brentwood
was realized and processing was immediately halted. All materials were
promptly shrink wrapped and sequestered including the trash bags. The
manager of the Fulfillment Center contacted the Kansas City Health
Department which in turn conferred directly with CDC and the Missouri
Department of Health & Senior Services. CDC recommended workers be placed
on cipro [ciprofloxacin]. The Fulfillment Center offered medical
evaluations and antibiotics to the workers, and 51 individuals elected to
[be] tested and begin cipro prophylaxis. The nasal swabs tests were all
negative. The facility remained open and did not close until the
preliminary positive results were known. Both positive tests came from a
trash bag associated with the Brentwood mail. Decontamination of the
Fulfillment Center will occur this weekend, including another round of
environmental testing post-decontamination.
It is important to stress that Postal officials believe that none of the
orders received in the Brentwood mail were processed and sent out. The area
where the mail is opened is in a different part of the facility where
cancellations are done and where finished products are prepared to be sent
out. These 2 areas are on different air handling systems.

"Ames" strain
--------------------
Here is what I make of the jumble of facts available:
An article (Vaccine 16 1141 (98) in which Ames strain is used as a liquid
aerosol to test our vaccine in primates, refers to an earlier paper on the
Ames strain; the earlier paper says it is a strain isolated from a cow in
1980. The N. Arizona database, against which the Senate letter sample is
being tested, contains a standard said to be identical to the letter
strain. That standard was obtained from Porton in the mid-80's, and Porton
had gotten it from USAMRIID. It is, they say, the US military strain.
Conclusion: the US military strain is the 1980 Ames and is the strain in
the letters. (Or, at least, 1980 Ames is ONE of the US military strains.)
Furthermore, the presence of silica in the letter sample indicates that it
was probably prepared by the US method. The big question is whether or not
it was prepared recently, by someone familiar with the US method and having
access to the strain, or whether it was prepared by the US military and
somehow acquired by others.
Analysis of the notes in the letters is said to suggest that they were not
written by middle-easterners [on the basis of what analysis? - Man. Ed.
DS]. The short time between 11 Sep and 18 Sep, when the first letters that
have been examined were mailed to New York, and 22 Sep, when the first
symptoms appeared in Florida, makes it unlikely that the anthrax [_B.
anthracis_] was prepared after 11 Sep. More likely, someone had a sample,
or access to a sample, and decided post-11 Sep to mail it.
