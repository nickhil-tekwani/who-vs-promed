The distribution of the new International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICV-P), otherwise known as Yellow Card, in Nigeria is being frustrated by shortage of personnel, the federal government said yesterday [6 Mar 2014].

Dr. Sani Gwarzo of the Department of Port Health Services (PHS), who was speaking during a sensitisation workshop organised for stakeholders on the new security-featured Yellow Card yesterday [6 Mar 2014] in Abuja, lamented that inadequate personnel, unenforceable and obsolete laws, and activities of fraudsters, among other problems, were hindering the exercise.

The department is charged with the responsibility of vaccination and issuance of Yellow Cards against the yellow fever disease.

Anyone travelling out of Nigeria is required to take the yellow fever vaccination, according to the World Health Organisation's requirement, and be provided with an international health certificate to indicate that he [or she] has been vaccinated.

The National Council on Health last year [2013] passed a resolution approving the production of new Yellow Cards by the PHS, which was launched by the Health Minister, Professor Onyebuchi Chukwu. The new card has many features which the organisers say make it almost impossible to duplicate.

Gwarzo said there was need for Nigerians to get the yellow fever vaccination because of its endemic nature and to save themselves and the country from embarrassment abroad.

[The availability of new yellow fever (YF) vaccination cards that cannot easily be illegally duplicated in Nigeria is good news. However, the difficulties in their distribution due to lack of personnel is of concern. The statement of Dr. Gwarzo indicating that "activities of fraudsters ... were hindering" the issuance of YF vaccination cards is worrisome, because it suggests that the sale of fake cards is continuing.

Inadvertent transport of YF virus in viremic individuals from Nigeria to YF virus-free areas of the world where ample mosquito vectors occur would be more than an embarrassment; it could be a public health disaster. One hopes that Nigerian health authorities will aggressively implement issuance of the new YF vaccination cards and crack down on sale of fake cards.

[YF virus-free areas of the world where ample mosquito vectors occur include every country with endemic dengue, and now the areas around San Franciso, California, and Houston, Texas, the Republic of Georgia and adjacent areas of southern Russia, where _Aedes aegypti_ has recently become established. - Mod.JW]
