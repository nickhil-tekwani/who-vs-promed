Japan: Drug-resistant influenza B virus found
-----------------------------------------------
Type B influenza viruses, which usually cause smaller epidemics than
type A influenza A viruses, developed partial resistance to the 2
front line antiviral drugs used to combat seasonal influenza,
according to a study published on Tuesday [3 Apr 2007]. While there
has been evidence of some type A flu viruses developing a resistance
to antiviral drugs, researchers at the University of Tokyo said that,
until their study, there has been only limited information involving
type B viruses.
The research involved Tamiflu, an antiviral drug made by Roche and
Gilead Sciences, and Relenza, made by GlaxoSmithKline and Biota
Holdings and known generically as zanamivir. Tamiflu, also known as
oseltamivir, is the 1st choice against both seasonal flu and H5N1
avian influenza [because it can be delivered orally. - Mod.CP].
The findings come from Japan, where both drugs are used more
extensively than anywhere else in the world to prevent and treat
seasonal flu. The study involved an influenza B virus outbreak in the
winter of 2004-2005 that caused a widespread epidemic.
Writing in this week's issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association (JAMA) [see below], researchers said they collected flu B
virus samples from 74 children before and after Tamiflu use and from
348 influenza patients -- also mostly children -- who were not
treated with the drug. They said they found a virus with reduced drug
sensitivity in one of the 74 children who had received Tamiflu. In
addition, 7 of the 422 influenza B viruses isolated from untreated
patients were found to have reduced sensitivity to Relenza, Tamiflu,
or both.
Drug-resistant flu viruses present a risk because the mutations can
make current drugs ineffective for both seasonal flu and a
potentially devastating bird flu epidemic. [It should be noted that,
unlike the influenza A viruses, the influenza B viruses have no
animal reservoirs and cannot initiate a bird flu pandemic. Influenza
B viruses of enhanced virulence could evolve by progressive mutation
but not by reassortment of genome sub-units with influenza A viruses.
- Mod.CP]
An editorial in the same issue commenting on the study said it raised
more questions than it answered. But, it said, "some facts are
strikingly clear. Influenza B mutants with reduced sensitivity to
(antiviral drugs) are circulating, and these viruses can cause
infections with no difference in duration of symptoms ... Contrary to
what had been hoped until now, some resistant variants are vigorous
pathogens. Whether these viruses arise by spontaneous mutation ... or
whether they are transmitted within families or acquired from the
community, the resistant variants may be here to stay," the editorial
added.

[The paper referred to above by Shuji Hatakeyama and 11 others is
entitled: Emergence of Influenza B Viruses With Reduced Sensitivity
to Neuraminidase Inhibitors. It is published in JAMA:
2007;297:1435-1442
<http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/297/13/1435>.
The Abstract reads in part: "Very little is known about the frequency
of generation and transmissibility of influenza B viruses with
reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors. Furthermore,
transmission of resistant virus, whether influenza A or B, has not
been recognized to date. The objective was to assess the prevalence
and transmissibility of influenza B viruses with reduced sensitivity
to neuraminidase inhibitors. [We investigated] the neuraminidase
inhibitor sensitivity of influenza B isolates from 74 children before
and after oseltamivir therapy and from 348 untreated patients with
influenza (including 66 adults) seen at 4 community hospitals in
Japan during the 2004-2005 influenza season. 422 viruses from
untreated patients and 74 samples from patients after oseltamivir
therapy were analyzed. Sialidase inhibition assay was used to test
the drug sensitivities of influenza B viruses. The neuraminidase and
hemagglutinin genes of viruses showing reduced sensitivity to
neuraminidase inhibitors were sequenced to identify mutations that
have the potential to confer reduced sensitivity to these drugs. In
the population examined, it was observed that influenza B viruses
with reduced sensitivity to neuraminidase inhibitors do not arise as
frequently as resistant influenza A viruses. However, they appear to
be transmitted within communities and families, requiring continued
close monitoring." - Mod.CP]
