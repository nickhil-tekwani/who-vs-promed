[A] Situation report on atypical pneumonia 10 Apr 2003

The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:

As of 1 PM 10 Apr 2003, an additional 28 patients with symptoms of atypical
pneumonia were admitted to public hospitals. They include 12 healthcare
workers (9 from Princess Margaret Hospital, one from Prince of Wales
Hospital, one from Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital, and one from
Queen Elizabeth Hospital) and 1 patient from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 15
were new patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.

A total of 154 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 12 were discharged today.
Most of the patients currently in hospital are showing positive responses
to the new treatment protocol. 120 patients are receiving treatment in
intensive care units.

3 patients died in Princess Margaret Hospital, bringing to 30 the total
number of deaths relating to atypical pneumonia. A 63-year-old male with a
history of chronic disease and a 46-year-old female died yesterday. Another
73-year-old female patient with a history of chronic disease died this morning.

The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:

Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged patients/ total no. deaths
(The numbers in bracket are those with pneumonia symptoms)

Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 253 (253)/
75/ 30
Patients, family members & visitors 745 (745)/ 79/

Total: 998 (998)/ 154/

* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of chronic
diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively late stage
of infection.

[B] Health Surveillance for airline passengers 10 Apr 2003

A spokesman for the Department of Health (DH) on 10 Apr 2003 called on
passengers who had taken any of the following 7 flights of Lufthansa German
Airlines between 30 Mar 2003 and 5 Apr 2003 to call DH's hotline 187 222
for health advice. The plea follows the detection of a confirmed case of
severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) involving a 48-year-old man who
had taken these flights during the period.

The 7 flights are :

LH 731 on 30 Mar 2003 (Hong Kong to Munich)
LH 4316 on 31 Mar 2003 (Munich to Barcelona)
LH 4303 on 2 Apr 2003 (Barcelona to Frankfurt)
LH 4520 on 2 Apr 2003 (Frankfurt to London)
LH 4671 on 3 Apr 2003 (London to Munich)
LH 265 on 4 Apr 2003 (Munich to Frankfurt)
LH 738 on 4 Apr 2003 (Frankfurt to Hong Kong)

Initial investigation revealed that the man had developed symptoms after he
arrived at Barcelona on 31 Mar 2003. He was admitted to Pamela Youde
Nethersole Eastern Hospital on 8 Apr 2003 and confirmed to have SARS today.

DH has informed the Airport Authority and the airline concerned. Advice was
also given to the airline concerned to disinfect the airplane. DH is
tracing the crew members and passengers who had taken these 7 flights for
surveillance purpose. The spokesman reminded people who have respiratory
symptoms including fever, chills, malaise and cough to avoid traveling by
plane before recovery.

[C] Health surveillance for airline passengers 9 Apr 2003

A spokesman for the Department of Health (DH) on 9 Apr 2003 called on
passengers who had traveled from Hong Kong to Taipei in flight CX 402
(Cathay Pacific) on 30 Mar 2003 to call DH's hotline 187 2222 for health
advice.

The plea follows the detection of a confirmed case of severe acute
respiratory syndrome involved a man living in Taiwan. Investigation
revealed that the man developed SARS symptoms before taking the flight. He
was admitted to a Taipei hospital on 1 Apr 2003. DH has informed the
Airport Authority and the airline concerned. Advice was also given to the
airline concerned to disinfect the airplane. DH is tracing the crew members
and passengers who had taken this flight for surveillance purpose.

SARS update - 10 Apr 2003

As of 10 Apr 2003, 77 SARS patients have been discharged. 47 SARS patients
remain hospitalised.

There were 7 additional SARS cases reported today, 5 of whom are linked to
the SGH cluster comprising 1 SGH staff member, 2 inpatients, and 2
visitors. The other 2 additional cases are a TTSH nurse who was in contact
with a SARS patient before the patient was diagnosed to be a SARS case and
a family member of a SARS patient. This family member is the husband of the
woman who broke quarantine and was transferred from NUH to TTSH on 5 Apr
2003. She is in intensive care.

SGH Ward 57 and 58 cluster
On 5 Apr 2003, SGH noted that a total of 21 staff from Wards 57 and 58 had
developed fever since the 1 Apr 2003; one on 1 and 2 Apr 2003, 2 on 3 Apr
2003, 9 on 4 Apr 2003, and 8 on 5 Apr 2003. SGH sent the affected staff to
TTSH and, while waiting for the medical assessment of the cases, stood down
that surgical team.

On 6 Apr 2003, as a precautionary measure and in order to ring-fence the
source of infection, SGH transferred all patients from Wards 57 and 58 to
TTSH. All patients who were formerly in Wards 57 and 58 during the period
from 20 Mar 2003 till 5 Apr 2003 and who were still in SGH were also
transferred to TTSH. Nurses, doctors, therapists, and other staff working
in these 2 wards were also transferred to TTSH. The transfer, involving 80
patients and 91 staff, was completed on 7 Apr 2003. SGH also contacting
discharged patients who were formerly in Wards 57 and 58 during the period
from 20 Mar 2003 through 5 Apr 2003, as well as visitors to these wards
during this period, to ensure their well-being.

So far, 52 persons have been linked to the SGH cluster at Wards 57 and 58,
comprising 19 probable and 33 suspect SARS cases. They comprise 26 SGH
staff, 14 visitors, and 12 inpatients. In addition, 2 SGH staff and 4
inpatients were admitted for observation. All 19 are stable except for 2
who are in serious condition in intensive care.

Epidemiological investigations have traced the source of this cluster of
infections to a Chinese man in his 60s who had been admitted to TTSH from 5
to 20 Mar 2003 for chronic kidney disease and diabetes. He was admitted to
SGH Ward 57 Intermediate Care Area on 24 Mar 2003 for gastrointestinal
bleeding. He had a diabetic foot ulcer and was noted to have a low-grade
fever since admission. A chest X-ray on 24 Mar 2003 was clear. He was
treated for his medical conditions and was started on antibiotics.

On 28 Mar 2003, he developed high fever. A repeat chest X-ray on that day
was normal. He was treated with antibiotics and on 29 Mar 2003, he was
transferred to Ward 58 B2. Tests showed that he had an infection of the
blood by _E.coli_. Chest X-ray on 30 Mar 2003 was again normal. He was
given a stronger antibiotic and on 3 Apr 2003, he no longer had fever.
However, his chest x-ray on 4 Apr 2003 showed signs of pneumonia and he has
been diagnosed as a SARS case by the doctors in TTSH.

Although the clinical picture of this patient is not typical of SARS, it is
likely that the typical symptoms of SARS were masked by his other
underlying medical conditions. It is believed that he had come in contact
with a SARS patient who had not yet been diagnosed during the time that he
was admitted to TTSH.

The 19 persons with probable SARS in the SGH cluster, comprising 1 doctor,
9 nurses, 1 radiographer, 1 housekeeper, 4 inpatients and 3 visitors, are
all linked to Wards 57 and 58. The hospital staff attended to the Chinese
man when he was in Wards 57 and 58. One visitor was his brother who visited
him while he was in SGH.

Apart from ring fencing the staff and inpatients from Ward 57 and 58 at
TTSH, to prevent further spread of infection, SGH has implemented mandatory
twice daily temperature checks for all staff, the use of N95 masks by all
their staff, and limiting visitors to 2 per patient. SGH has also
reorganised their teams of doctors to only work in specified locations.
This will help localise patient-doctor interactions to specific physical
sites and will facilitate future epidemiological investigations, if necessary.

Orange Valley Nursing Home cluster
It was reported that a nurse from Orange Valley Nursing Home was admitted
to CGH on 4 Apr 2003 for pneumonia and transferred to TTSH on 6 Apr 2003
for probable SARS. He has been in intensive care since transfer to TTSH.

Investigations have revealed that a resident of the nursing home was
admitted to CGH on 25 Mar 2003 and died of pneumonia on 30 Mar 2003. This
nursing home resident had been earlier discharged from TTSH on 23 Mar 2003
for non-SARS related condition. When the patient was in TTSH she was warded
next to a patient who was later diagnosed as a SARS case. The male nurse
from the nursing home had been attending to this resident. The
daughter-in-law of this nursing home resident, a mediaCorp staff member,
was admitted to TTSH on 7 Apr 2003 for SARS. She is in serious condition in
intensive care. A friend of hers who was in contact with her when she was
unwell has also been admitted to TTSH on 8 Apr 2003. She is in stable
condition.

The girlfriend of the nurse from Orange Valley Nursing Home and the teenage
son of the MediaCorp staff member, who is a student of Zhonghua Secondary
School, have been admitted as suspect SARS cases. Although it is believed
that the resident of Orange Valley Nursing Home was the source of
infection, investigations are still ongoing to exclude other sources.

TTSH Rehab Dept at Ang Mo Kio Community Hospital
At this point, investigations suggest that the source of infection for the
TTSH occupational therapist might have been the SARS patient who presented
at the NUH Emergency Department on 23 Mar 2003.

Implications of the SGH cluster of infections
To reduce the spread of SARS, Singapore has adopted an isolate-and-contain
strategy, involving comprehensive and practical measures, and at times
stronger than what is being done in other affected countries. One key
thrust is to identify symptomatic cases as early as possible so that they
can receive treatment and are isolated early. As a precautionary measure,
close contacts of SARS patients are ring-fenced through home quarantine.
Though contact tracing is not 100 percent foolproof, it helps to
significantly reduce any further transmission of SARS, especially to the
community at large.

The isolate and contain approach is also adapted for schools. When a case
is discovered in school or institute of higher learning, it will be shut
down for 3 days. This will facilitate active contract tracing, and
epidemiological investigations, while reducing the risk of exposure of
students to SARS.

For healthcare facilities, Tan Tock Seng Hospital Hospital/Communicable
Disease Centre (TTSH/CDC) is the only hospital designated to screen and
treat both adults and children with or suspected to have SARS. These
patients are treated in isolation rooms under strict infection control
procedures. They are not allowed visitors. SARS is a very new disease, and
we are learning that it can present in atypical ways, particularly in
patients with other types of medical conditions. These medical conditions
mask the typical features of SARS and make it very difficult for the
diagnosis to be made early. This is illustrated by the case in SGH.

In view of this, MOH has this week further enhanced its infection control
requirements in all hospitals. The types of cases that hospitals need to
identify early and isolate has been broadened to include all cases of
atypical pneumonia and fever without a known cause, as well as healthcare
workers who present with fever and/or respiratory symptoms of undetermined
cause. All hospitals are required to ensure that the temperatures of all
its healthcare workers are checked at least twice daily, with the first
check being done before the staff start work.

Febrile staff should not be allowed to work. The number of visitors to
hospitals is also being limited and their details should be noted, to
facilitate contact tracing should the need arise. This is on top of the
procedures which MOH has already established with Accident and Emergency
Departments in all hospitals, on how to handle patients who are unwell and
suspected to have SARS. Staff are required to adopt full infection control
precautions and if they come across any such patients, they are instructed
to transfer them to TTSH for further examination. A system of protected
triage staff in SOCs and polyclinics has also been established.

Our isolate-and-contain strategy seems to be holding up. SARS cases are
referred to TTSH as soon as they are detected in other hospitals. This will
help contain the spread and chance of outbreak in other hospitals and
reduce the risk of spread into the community. In SGH, patients in the
affected wards were transferred to TTSH for treatment. We should expect
that from time to time, clusters of infections may occur in our hospitals
mainly from atypical cases that later turn out to be SARS. The public
should be reassured that there is a robust system in place to minimise and
respond quickly to such situations.

Disposal of bio-hazardous wastes
Since 1988, our hospitals have put in place a system to ensure that all
bio-hazardous medical wastes (including masks, gloves, needles, etc.) are
segregated from general waste and safely disposed of. Bio-hazardous wastes
can only be collected by specially licensed waste collectors (only 3 of
them in Singapore), transported in dedicated vehicles, and brought to
specially designed and dedicated incinerators for disposal. Our procedures
for handling bio-hazardous medical wastes are in accordance with WHO
guidelines.

In Singapore, all wastewater is discharged into a closed sewerage system.
The wastewater is conveyed through deep underground pipes to wastewater
treatment plants for treatment. At the plants, our workers too do not come
into contact with the sewage. As a precaution, our workers are provided
with protective gear and gloves etc. when they carry out maintenance work.
These underground sewers keep all wastewater out of contact with the public
thus ensuring public health safety.

Home Quarantine
From today, MOH is engaging the services of CISCO to serve Home Quarantine
Orders and ensure that contacts of probable SARS cases comply with the
orders. The measure follows a limited number of incidents in which the home
quarantine order was flouted. In one such incident, the contact who
eventually became a SARS case went down to see her General Practitioner on
3 Apr 2003 and did not disclose that she was under home quarantine. When
her condition did not improve, her relative also broke quarantine and
ferried her in his car to NUH instead of using the available ambulance
service to TTSH. This irresponsible behaviour presents not just a risk to
the public but can also cause other hospitals to become contaminated with SARS.

The CISCO officers who serve the Order will site an electronic picture
(EPIC) camera at the home of each contact. The contacts will be called at
random intervals daily and requested to turn on the camera and present
themselves in front of the camera to show their presence. Anyone found
breaking the quarantine will be served a written warning and given an
electronic wrist tag. The tag is linked to a dedicated telephone line and
will alert the authorities if the person leaves the house again or tries to
break the tag. Under section 65 of the Infectious Diseases Act, persons
found guilty of an offence shall be liable on conviction to a fine not
exceeding $5000 and in the case of a second or subsequent offence, liable
to a fine not exceeding $10 000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding
6 months or to both.

Today, 53 passengers from affected areas required further screening by the
nurses at the airport. None were referred to TTSH for further assessment.

Summary of SARS cases
To date, the total number of people diagnosed with SARS is 133. Among these
are 3 children below 18 years of age. Out of the 47 patients still
hospitalised, 13 are in intensive care. The Ngee Ann Polytechnic student
was discharged from intensive care yesterday. There were no new admissions
to intensive care.

The number of suspect cases admitted is 82, including 5 children (below 18
years old). The number of people under Home Quarantine Orders is 490.

Summary of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Cases 10 Apr 2003

Since yesterday, no additional probable cases of SARS have been reported in
Canada. A total of 98 individuals who meet the probable case definition of
SARS have been reported in Ontario and British Columbia, including 10
deaths; 154 individuals who meet the definition of a suspect case of SARS
have also been reported in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Ontario, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Since SARS is a diagnosis
of exclusion, the status of a reported case may change over time.

At the present time, the case fatality rate in Canada is estimated at
approximately 4.0 percent of probable or suspect cases (10 of 253 probable
or suspect cases). Most of the case fatalities occurred in patients with
underlying illness, and nearly all were elderly patients over the age of 70
years.

A summary of the current status of probable cases of SARS in Canada as of
10 Apr 2003 is presented in Table 2. 25 individuals have been discharged
(25.5 percent) and of the 63 individuals currently hospitalised, 39 (65
percent) are improving or in stable condition. In addition, nearly all of
the suspect cases reported in Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta,
Saskatchewan, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have either recovered
or are presently recovering.

(1) Includes cases who have either recovered or are recovering

[The current number of probable cases by reported symptom onset date and
type of exposure is provided in a figure on the website link provided above]

There is currently no evidence to suggest the presence of community
transmission of SARS in Canada. All identified probable cases of SARS have
been linked to either travel-related exposures, or in healthcare and
household settings (Table 3). The index case in Ontario was an individual
who travelled to Hong Kong and stayed at the Metropole Hotel, where a
cluster of SARS cases was subsequently identified (MMWR Vol 52, No. 12,
March 28, 2003) . Upon return to Canada, disease transmission occurred in 4
members of the immediate and extended family, and nearly all subsequently
identified probable cases in Ontario have been epidemiologically linked to
exposure to the first hospitalised family member of the index case. Other
probable cases reported in Ontario as well as British Columbia have all
been attributed to travel-related exposures. Thus, there is currently no
evidence to suggest that community transmission is occurring in Canada.

Hospital or healthcare-related setting: 72/ 73.5 percent
Household: 19/ 19.4 percent

[In a press briefing today, CDC Director Gerberding discussed a possible
community transmission of SARS in Florida that is currently under
investigation. This "involved a person who traveled to Asia and developed
an illness consistent with SARS. In the very early phases of that illness,
the individual did go to work, and during the active monitoring of contacts
that the Florida health department is conducting, an individual in the
workplace who has respiratory illness was identified." We await further
information on this investigation. - Mod.MPP]

[The identification of SARS cases that have travelled by airplane while
actively symptomatic is disconcerting as the implications for further
spread to airline crew members as well as passengers sitting in proximity
to the cases. The Department of Health of Hong Kong is to be commended for
the in-depth investigation of potential contacts and the alerting of
airlines of potential problems. These instances are illustrative of the
difficulties in case containment. By now there has been extensive
dissemination of information, yet ill individuals are still travelling in
an attempt to get home for medical care.

The discussion of the new cluster associated with contact with a case of
SARS that did not present with typical symptoms in Singapore is
interesting, and a sobering reminder that once SARS cases have been
introduced into the healthcare environment, there may be atypical
presentations. The control measures taken by Singapore in the face of the
SARS outbreak are impressive and wide ranging. Prior to this new cluster,
it did appear that transmission had been limited and might be interrupted
fairly soon.

We have posted the information on SARS statistics reported by the European
Union, presenting a consolidation of case reporting for all member nations
as well as other non-EU member nations in the European Continent. This
represents a great effort on the part of the region to consolidate disease
control activities.

According to today's reports there have been no new probable cases reported
in Canada. In the USA, there have been an additional 12 suspected cases
reported since the last update on 9 Apr 2003. - Mod.MPP]
