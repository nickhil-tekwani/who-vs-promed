Concerning the Risk of Introduction of West Nile Virus into Hawaii
---------------------------------------------------
With reference to the possibility of West Nile virus being introduced
into Hawaii, several things keep going through my mind.
Firstly, do the Hawaiian islands have the same types of crows and
other susceptible birds as mainland North America? If they are
different this might have a significant impact on West Nile virus in
Hawaii if the virus is introduced.
Secondly, if there is concern about West Nile virus being introduced
into Hawaii, why has St Louis encephalitis virus not been introduced
into Hawaii? It has had a much longer opportunity than West Nile
virus.
