Rearing its ugly head - bunchy top disease
------------------------------------------
The stunted plants infected with banana bunchy top disease (BBTD)
sport an unkempt shock of erect, narrow spikes with yellow edges.
Fruit are scarce, perhaps just a few twisted, deformed fingers. Life
expectancy of infected plants is low, the disease spreading rapidly,
aided by an insect vector, the black banana aphid, and the use of
infected planting material. Within a few crop cycles, a village's
banana production has collapsed.

In Malawi, BBTD causes 40 percent of annual production losses in
banana, with nearly half a million hectares devastated by the
disease. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, Mozambique, and
Zambia have also recently experienced severe outbreaks, and the
disease has been reported as far north as Cameroon for the 1st time,
in a survey done by IITA [International Institute for Tropical
Agriculture] and national partners.

The causes for the recent spread of this virus are not well
understood. BBTD has become one of the most serious pest and disease
problems facing smallholder banana farmers on the African continent.

Ten threatened countries are collaborating with Bioversity
International, IITA, and CARBAP [African Centre for Research on
Banana and Plantain] to develop and implement disease management
strategies. Nearly all bananas and plantains in sub-Saharan Africa
originate from locally produced suckers, which is ideal for rapid
disease spread. Tolerant varieties become a store for the virus,
increasing the threat to more marketable but susceptible varieties.
Effective quarantine between regions is almost impossible. Developing
innovative systems to produce and distribute clean banana suckers is
a key focus of the partnership's work.

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the only member of the genus
_Babuvirus_ (family _Nanoviridae_) and only affects _Musa_ species.
It causes one of the most serious diseases of banana with symptoms of
chlorosis, stunting, and death of the host plant. The virus is
spreading in Africa, Australasia, and the Pacific Islands. BBTV is
transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia nigronervosa_ in a
persistent manner and is probably retained when the vector moults.
Infectious insects may be spread on plant material. The virus is also
spread with infected suckers but cannot be transmitted by mechanical means.

Once established, BBTV is extremely difficult to eradicate or manage.
Disease management includes vector control, removal of inoculum, use
of clean planting material, and frequent scouting for new outbreaks.
Planting tolerant varieties will enable some crop production in
infected areas, but these cultivars may still support virus
replication and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs. Viruses can also
be distributed with infected tissue cultures, and this may have
played a role in the more recent spread of BBTV. For more information
