Barley diseases are evolving. Barley can be inflicted with any one or a selection of diseases, depending on variety, sowing date and general environmental conditions.

Some of the key barley diseases present challenges to our current fungicide chemistry and what worked in the past may not work as well now. "SDHI plus triazole fungicides are the backbone of disease control on barley," stated Billy Cotter of Syngenta.

The key disease on winter and spring barley is rhynchosporium. A [fungicide with] combination of curative activity with long persistence to prevent the disease becoming established [is needed].

Net blotch is an increasingly difficult disease to control, with confirmed insensitivity to strobilurin chemistry and indications of sensitivity shifts to SDHI fungicides. Billy stated: "There are reports of net blotch strains with reduced sensitivity to SDHIs on the continent, but these do not appear to be significant in the Irish population yet."

Ramularia has become a more challenging disease in recent years. "We know the local population has reduced sensitivity to SDHI and also probably triazole chemistry," Billy explained.

[Scald
-----
Scald (or leaf blotch) caused by _Rhynchosporium secalis_ is one of the most destructive diseases of barley, particularly in wet conditions. It can decrease yield by up to 40 per cent and reduces grain quality. Symptoms include lesions on leaves and leaf sheaths which later merge into large areas of dead tissue and may destroy the whole green leaf area of the plant. The pathogen can also cause symptomless seed infection which leads to a high risk of spread.

Scald is a polycyclic disease, with the primary inoculum produced on crop debris and infected seeds. Secondary disease spread occurs primarily by splashing rain. The fungus is highly variable and a sexual stage is likely to exist. Management strategies include cultural practices to reduce inoculum, fungicides and use of clean seed. No durable single major resistance genes for scald are known. Field resistance appears to be substantially polygenic which makes resistance breeding difficult.

Net blotch
----------
Net blotch of barley is caused by the fungus _Pyrenophora teres_ and affects only domestic and wild barleys (_Hordeum_ spp.). The disease causes necrotic areas on leaves leading to yield losses of up to 20 percent. There are 2 types of the fungus, the net type caused by _P. t._ f. _teres_ and the spot type caused by _P. t._ f. _maculata_. The fungus survives between seasons on barley residue, volunteer barley plants, some grasses and seed. Disease management includes cultural practices to remove pathogen reservoirs, fungicide applications, use of clean seed and use of resistant cultivars. Highly aggressive new strains of the net form are emerging worldwide.

Fungicide resistant strains of both the net and spot forms have recently been reported to emerge in Australia (see link below).

Ramularia
---------
Ramularia leaf spot (RLS) of barley is caused by the fungus _Ramularia collo-cygni_. It is considered an emerging pathogen of increasing importance on barley crops, especially in Northern Europe. Symptoms including small brown rectangular lesions with yellow margins within leaf veins, premature leaf senescence and loss of plant vigour. RLS can cause extensive damage to the upper leaves in spring and winter barley once crops have finished flowering, which can lead to extensive losses in yield and quality. RLS is often found in association with other leaf spots such as sun burn, agrochemical scorch or nutritional stress.

The fungus is spread with infected plant material and wind. It can also affect some other graminaceous hosts, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. It can be detected on seeds and in symptomless leaves and may spread in crops sometimes without causing severe epidemics. The fungus has a long endophytic growth stage before becoming an aggressive pathogen. It poses the greatest threat to spring malting barley and resistant varieties are being developed. Disease management at present relies mainly on fungicide treatments, with correct timing being critical.

The related species _Ramularia beticola_ causes leaf spot disease on sugarbeet.

The report above again emphasises the importance of rotating or mixing chemical classes of fungicides to counteract pathogen evolution and extend the useful life of any of the compounds.
