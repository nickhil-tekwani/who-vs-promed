Brazil will require yellow fever International Certificate of Vaccination (ICV)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health will require, from the 1st half of July [2016], the International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP) to travelers coming from or intended to arrive from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola. The measure is temporary and is a recommendation of the World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Committee, because of urban yellow fever outbreaks ongoing in both countries since December last year [2015].

The orientation was defined by the Committee's meeting during the World Health Assembly, held in late May [2016] in Switzerland. The measure is also preventive for the Olympic and Paralympic Games which take place in Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo, Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, Salvador and Manaus.

Currently, Brazil has 3 direct flights to Angola. Travelers, delegations and athletes in transit through such countries must present the certificate with vaccination date with at least 10 days prior to travel. The requirement should remain until new WHO recommendations are issued.

The Ministry of Health sent the decision to the embassies of Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo, as well as the Rio 2016 groups organizing the Olympic and Paralympic Games for the necessary arrangements with the International Olympic Committee and sports delegation countries. In addition, the office requested that the National Health Surveillance Agency (Anvisa) communicate that guidance to air and tourism companies.

"Regardless of this measure, the Ministry of Health recommends that in the service of travelers with symptoms of yellow fever, health professionals investigate carefully the travel history to the 2 countries for the identification of suspected cases and adoption of appropriate preventive measures and control," says the general coordinator of Surveillance and Response to Emergencies in Public Health of the Ministry of Health, Wanderson Oliveira.

[Brazil is wise to require yellow fever vaccination certificates for travelers arriving from Angola and the Congo DR where yellow fever (YF) virus transmission is ongoing. Also, one wonders if Uganda should be included, since there is YF transmission going on there as well, but to a much lesser extent. Any traveler going to those areas in Brazil where YF is endemic should be vaccinated at least 10 days before their arrival in Brazil. - Mod.TY
