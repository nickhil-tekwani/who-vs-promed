[Now that the incidence, in the UK, of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease --
abbreviated as CJD (new var.) or vCJD in ProMED-mail -- shows evidence of
having peaked, or, at least of having reached a plateau, the Department of
Health's full table of definite, and probable, CJD deaths and referrals
will no longer be reproduced in ProMED-mail. Only the monthly summary of
variant CJD statistics will be posted, unless there is a substantial change
in the situation. The full table, updated monthly, can be accessed at the
Department of Health website:
<http://www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/08/35/86/04083586.pdf>.
The precise definition of the terms deaths, definite cases, probable vCJD
cases, and, the case definitions can be found by accessing the Department
of Health web-site, or, by reference to a previous ProMED-mail post in this
thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK: update Mar 2002 20020305.3693) -

Monthly variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease statistics as of Mon 10 Jan 2005
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health is today [Mon 10 Jan 2005] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), the form
of the disease thought to be linked to BSE. The position is as follows:
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK:
Summary of vCJD cases - deaths
------------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 106
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 41
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 1
Total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 148
Summary of vCJD cases - alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 5
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 153
(The next update will be published on Mon 7 Feb 2005)
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 6 Dec 2004, the
number of deaths from definite vCJD is unchanged at 106, while the total
number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD has increased by one and is
now 148. The number of probable vCJD cases still alive remains at 5.
Therefore the overall total number of definite or probable vCJD cases has
increased by one since 6 Dec 2004 to become 153. - Mod.CP]

Variant CJD patient "no longer terminally ill"
----------------------------------------------
A man suffering from the human form of mad cow disease [variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease] is no longer considered terminally ill after
undergoing an experimental medical treatment obtained following a legal
battle by his family. The young man, aged 20, from Belfast, was a talented
youth footballer when he was diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease (vCJD). As his health rapidly declined his family went to court for
him to be allowed to take the drug pentosan polysulphate.
In Britain 147 [148 as of 10 Jan 2005] people have died from the rare brain
disease. The Belfast patient is the only person known to have survived 3
years while suffering from the disease. Usually patients diagnosed with
vCJD survive about 14 months.
"The general consensus... ...is that my son is no longer terminally ill,"
his father told BBC Radio Ulster following a medical evaluation of his son.
Dr Stephen Dealler, consultant microbiologist at Lancaster Royal Infirmary
and one of a team of CJD experts involved in the patient's care, confirmed
last night that the teenager's condition had become stable. "Everyone was
shocked at how he responded. We had expected him to die in April [2004] but
at a meeting to discuss his progress several months ago people realised
that he had not gone downhill. In fact, there was some evidence that the
disease had disappeared, although nobody is able to say he will get better.
His condition certainly seems to have stabilised."
Dr Dealler said the young man was the 1st patient to receive the treatment
and had so far shown the most progress. "About 12 people have been treated
so far," he said. "One died despite treatment, some have continued without
improvement but the condition of about 6 has stabilised."
After a legal battle with the National Health Service, during which the
young man's condition deteriorated to the point where he needed constant
care, his father won permission in December 2002 to start the experimental
treatment. The patient has since undergone 2 years of having pentosan
polysulphate injected directly into his brain. Because the drug, which is
used in the USA to treat cystitis, has anticoagulant blood thinner and
anti-inflammatory properties, it was thought to carry the risk of side
effects. "If we had been shown and, it is still the case, that pentosan was
causing the patient severe pain and stress we would have to take him off
that compound, we would have to kiss him and let him go," the patient's
father said.
