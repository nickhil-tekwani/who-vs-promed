Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, New Zealand
---------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 4 Apr 2018 from Dr Tony Zohrab, Policy and Trade Branch, Ministry for Primary Industries, Wellington, New Zealand

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Date of start of the event: 16 Mar 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 3 Apr 2018
Reason for notification: new strain of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 1 strain K5
Serotype: RHDVa
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Cardrona Valley Road, Wanaka, Cardrona, Otago
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Mar 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
European rabbit: _Oryctolagus cuniculus_ (Leporidae) / - / 1 / 1 / 0 / 0
Affected population: a single dead adult rabbit found about 200 meters from an RHDV1-K5 release site.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Released as a biological agent
Epidemiological comment: the Korean or K5 variant of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 1 (RHDV1-K5) was released as a biological control agent in the Otago region of New Zealand on 12 Mar 2018. This was the initial release of a nationwide release programme planned with the intent of maximising its effectiveness against wild rabbit populations. This case is the 1st reported case following the release of RHDV1-K5. RHDV1-K5 is now considered endemic throughout the country. The Czech strain of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus 1 has been present in New Zealand since 1997.

Control measures
Measures applied: vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Landcare Research, Lincoln (Private Laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
European rabbit / gene sequencing / 3 Apr 2018 / Positive
European rabbit / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 22 Mar 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The 1st outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay and Reunion Island.

RHDV is a highly virulent lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _Oryctolagus cuniculus_.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90 percent), and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival, or oral routes. K5 is a Korean strain already released in Australia and New Zealand.

For these characteristics of RHDV, it was deliberately released in Australia and New Zealand. There, RHD has reduced rabbit abundance, particularly in dry regions, but rabbits in cooler, high-rainfall areas have been able to maintain their populations. In Australia and New Zealand, RHD has raised the prospects for managing rabbits in low rainfall areas and brought substantial economic and environmental benefits. It is expected that after many generations the defence strategies of rabbits evolve to resist and/or tolerate RHDV, so introduction of a novel strain might enable boosting the efficiency of RHD as a biological control. - Mod.PMB
