Incidents of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], which affects domestic herds, have been reported with increasing frequency from various parts of Tibet this year [2013]. China's Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) has said that the disease had now been confirmed in a village in Biru (Tibetan: Driru) County in Nagqu (Nagchu) Prefecture, Tibet Autonomous Region, after it was suspected to have hit 7 head of cattle on 10 Aug 12013, reported China's official Xinhua news agency on 26 Aug 2013.

The report also cited the MOA as saying that on 19 Aug 2013, another village in Nagqu County in the same prefecture reported that 99 head of cattle showed symptoms of the disease. It added that the national FMD reference laboratory confirmed the 2 cases as FMDV [serotype] A.

Xinhua had reported other confirmed incidents of FMD infections earlier this year [2013] in Pome (Chinese: Bomi) County in Nyingtri Prefecture (10 Jul 2013), a village in Shangri-La (Gyalthang) County of Yunnan Province (9 Jun 2012), Shigatse Prefecture (22 Apr and 5 Aug 2013), and in Chamdo (Changdu) Prefecture (13 Aug 2013).
