Three children at one London hospital in mid-April [2020], followed the next day by 3 at another -- for Elizabeth Whittaker, a pediatric infectious disease doctor at Imperial College London, those 1st cases raised an alarm. The youngsters had fevers, rashes, stomach pain, and, in some cases, heart problems, along with blood markers that characterize COVID-19 in adults, including one associated with clotting. But in most, nasal swabs failed to reveal any virus.

"I don't understand -- they look like they have coronavirus," Whittaker recalls thinking. Doctors nonetheless suspected a link. Within days, a survey turned up 19 additional cases across England, and an alert on [27 Apr 2020] asked doctors to be on the lookout for such symptoms in children. Soon after, dozens more cases surfaced in New York along with smaller clusters elsewhere, bolstering a connection to the pandemic. Reports of children on life support and some deaths put parents on edge -- and were especially disheartening after earlier signs that COVID-19 largely spares children from serious illness.

It is another surprise from a virus that has proffered many, and projects worldwide are gearing up to study it. They are combing the blood and sequencing the genomes of patients -- and the virus, if it can be isolated from them -- to search for clues to what makes some children susceptible and how to head off the worst symptoms. There's hope that what's learned from young patients might help the many adults in whom COVID-19 also triggers a grievous overreaction of the immune system.

In some respects, "It's absolutely not shocking" to see this, says Rae Yeung, a rheumatologist and immunologist at the Hospital for Sick Children [Toronto, Canada], whose center treated 20 children over the past 3 weeks with similar symptoms. Many pathogens occasionally trigger a similar hyperactive immune response in children, known as Kawasaki disease. Its symptoms vary but include rash, fever, and inflammation in medium-size blood vessels. Children can suffer heart problems. In rare cases, blood pressure plummets and shock sets in.

Doctors disagree on whether the variant linked to COVID-19 is Kawasaki disease or something new, with some experts calling it multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. But as with Kawasaki disease, most recover with treatment, including steroids and immunoglobulins, which calm the immune system.

In linking the inflammatory syndrome to COVID-19, "We're going on more than just a hunch," says Jesse Papenburg, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Montreal Children's Hospital, in a city that's seen about 25 children with the condition. Kawasaki disease is rare, ordinarily affecting just 1 to 3 in every 10 000 children in Western countries, though it's more common in children with Asian ancestry. The spikes recorded so far, in COVID-19 hot spots like northern Italy and New York City, track the novel coronavirus' march around the world. And although a minority of these children test positive for SARS-CoV-2, a study published in The Lancet [see ref below] by a team in Bergamo, Italy, reported that 8 of 10 children with the Kawasaki-like illness had antibodies to the virus, indicating they had been infected. Positive antibody tests have been reported in sick children elsewhere, too.

"It was obvious that there was a link," says Lorenzo D'Antiga, a pediatrician at the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital who led the study. The new coronavirus can elicit a powerful immune response, which he thinks may explain why shock and a massive immune reaction called a cytokine storm are more common in the COVID-19-linked cases than in textbook Kawasaki disease. And a time lag between infection and the Kawasaki-like illness could explain why many of the affected children show no evidence of the virus. The immune system's overreaction may unfold over weeks, though virus could also be hiding somewhere in the body.

"There's clearly some underlying genetic component" that puts a small number of children at risk, says Tom Maniatis, founding director of Columbia University's Precision Medicine Initiative [New York City, USA]. New York state is investigating 157 cases, and Maniatis is also CEO of the New York Genome Center, which is pursuing whole-genome sequencing of affected children and their parents, as well as sequencing the virus found in children, with family consent. Finding genes that heighten risk of the illness or of developing a severe case could point to better treatments or help identify children who may take a sudden turn for the worse.

Genetics may also help explain a puzzle: why the illness hasn't been reported in Asian countries, even though Kawasaki disease is far more common in children with Asian ancestry. The virus' own genetics may be important; an analysis last month [April 2020] indicated the predominant viral variant in New York was brought by travelers from Europe. It's also possible that the Kawasaki-like illness is so rare that it only shows up in COVID-19 hotbeds. "The areas that have been hardest hit by coronavirus are the areas reporting this syndrome now," says Alan Schroeder, a critical care physician at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at Stanford University [California, USA], which has seen one potentially affected child, a 6-month-old baby, who healed quickly.

Yeung is pursuing ways to flag children with COVID-19 who are at risk of this complication. She co-leads an international consortium that's banking blood from affected children both before and after treatment and screening for various markers, including the cytokine molecules that indicate a revved-up immune system. They are also searching for gene variants known to predict poor outcomes in Kawasaki disease. "There's also core COVID stuff that needs to be measured," Yeung says, such as markers of heart function and levels of D-dimer, a protein fragment in the blood that indicates a tendency toward clotting and that surges in many sick adults.

Another project, called DIAMONDS and originally designed to improve diagnostics of pathogens based on patterns of immune response in children with fevers, is recruiting children across Europe with the Kawasaki-like complication, along with those who have run of the mill COVID-19 symptoms. Scientists will study blood for pathogens-- not just SARS-CoV-2 -- and the behavior of immune cells such as T cells and B cells.

"We have to do a deep dive into the immunology of those patients," says Elie Haddad, a pediatric immunologist and scientist at the St Justine University Hospital Center [Montreal, Canada] who, with Yeung and Susanne Benseler at Alberta Children's Hospital, is leading Canadian research efforts on the new syndrome. These deep dives may also clarify the immune system chaos seen in many sick adults. Children are "cleaner," Haddad points out -- they're less likely to have other health burdens, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, that can make it harder to tease out the virus' impact on the immune system.

It's possible, too, that the illness affects adults as well but is harder to tease out from their other symptoms. A global effort studying COVID-19 in adults, called the International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium, will look at adults' clinical data and blood samples, Whittaker says, "to see, is this a uniquely pediatric problem?" [see item [2] below]

Eager as they are to understand this new face of the pandemic, doctors want to avoid overstating the hazards. "We need to identify early and we need to intervene early" in treating these children, Yeung says. But she also urges calm. "The kids we're seeing so far," she stresses, "they respond to the treatments we're giving."

[2] USA: young adults, Kawasaki-like disease

Recent public health warnings about a severe and puzzling inflammatory syndrome linked to COVID-19 have focused on children. But some doctors say they are also seeing the illness, similar to Kawasaki disease, in a few young adults. A 20-year-old is being treated for the condition in San Diego [California, USA], a 25-year-old has been diagnosed at Northwell Health's Long Island Jewish Medical Center [New York, USA], and several patients in their early 20s are hospitalized with the syndrome at NYU Langone in New York City [USA].

Jennifer Lighter, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor at NYU Langone, said younger children with the condition seem to have symptoms that look more like traditional Kawasaki, which is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels. But teens and young adults have more of an "overwhelming" response involving the heart and multiple organs. "The older ones have had a more severe course," Lighter said.

Physician Jane Burns, who runs the Kawasaki Disease Research Center at University of California at San Diego, worries the condition may be underdiagnosed in adults. The challenge, she said, is that many doctors who treat adults have "never seen Kawasaki disease before because that's a disease of children." Moreover, it's trickier to get a quick look at adults' hearts, because their chest walls are so thick and ultrasounds may be more difficult to interpret.

Burns and her colleagues are setting up a way for Rady Children's specialists to screen adults suspected to have the illness, and are talking with public health officials about expanding warnings about the condition to include young adults. What "internists need to be aware of is that maybe this is coming their way," she said.

The presentation of the new illness is very different from what doctors saw in children with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, who showed up at emergency rooms during the 1st wave of sickness in March and April [2020]. Back then, many pediatric patients had preexisting conditions, active coronavirus infections, and trouble breathing. Those coming in now are mostly previously healthy children and young adults who suddenly develop fever, abdominal pain and/or nausea and vomiting and rashes that can be signs of more serious problems.

Many of the patients have antibodies to the coronavirus -- suggesting they may have been infected weeks earlier and the condition may be a delayed immune response.

While the overall number of COVID-19 patients has dropped off sharply in New York City and other early hot spots, the number of children and young adults with the inflammatory condition continues to mount. As of this week, more than 20 states have reported cases with the total number estimated to be several hundred. New York City has reported 147 children with the condition [see updated figures below in section[3]. On Wednesday [20 May 2020], Children's National Hospital in the District announced it had 23 cases.

The syndrome appears to be rare, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- which recently dubbed the condition MIS-C or multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children -- has expressed alarm about the rapid decline of patients with the illness. The health agency and major medical groups have urged parents to seek an urgent evaluation if they suspect their child may have the condition.

At least 4 children, 3 in New York state and a 15-year-old girl in Maryland, have died of apparent MIS-C in recent weeks.

Doctors note the distinction between a child and an adult is a legal one, rather than a biological one. In the United States, 18th birthdays are often marked as a milestone in people's lives -- the moment when they gain privileges such as the right to vote, buy a house or get married in most states. But changes in the human body occur more on a continuum, with certain stages of life, such as puberty, involving more rapid changes than others.

People in their 20s are at their physiological peak in terms of their lung capacity, reproductive system and strength. So in this way, young adults may be more similar to children than to people in their 30s -- some of whom may be starting to experience the slow, gradual declines of aging.

Many other viruses -- chickenpox and measles are classic examples -- appear very differently in children than adults, and it's unknown exactly why.

The cause of Kawasaki has long been a mystery, and the same is true of the inflammatory syndrome linked to COVID-19. But doctors say they suspect some people are born with a genetic predisposition for an overactive immune response to the coronavirus that triggers a Kawasaki-like syndrome.

The New York State Health Department is conducting genetic tests of patients' DNA to figure out whether there is a common link among the children who have the condition.

Lighter said that in the context of estimates that about 1/3 of New York City residents have been exposed to the coronavirus -- a rough ballpark some doctors have used as a way of estimating the incidence of various covid-19 presentations -- the 147 children reported sick represent a very small number.

On an individual level, that's good news, she said. But because most of the country has not been exposed yet, even that tiny percentage could end up translating into a significant number of cases of the inflammation syndrome. "When you have a new pathogen infecting a large population, you are seeing more blips," Lighter said.

James Schneider, a pediatric critical care doctor at Northwell Health, emphasized that this illness is not something that can be treated at home. Patients with the syndrome have needed blood pressure medications, steroids, anticoagulants, immunoglobulin, and sometimes ventilators to get better. A few have gone into cardiac arrest and had to be revived through CPR.

Of the 44 children with MIS-C treated at Northwell, about 80 percent have recovered and have been discharged to home, he said. "Thankfully we have not had any mortalities in our institution. I sure hope to keep it that way," Schneider said.

[Note that the case definition proposed by CDC for this syndrome includes a history of COVID-19 which may influence the proportion of cases with history of COVID-19, and limits the age of presentation to less than 21 years of age. I suspect that like following the 1st announcement of this syndrome, we may move from a "don't look and it isn't there" surveillance in young adults to a "seek and ye shall find" surveillance.

The statement re: Internal Medicine specialists who treat young adults when they "outgrow" their pediatricians age wise, haven't seen many if any cases of Kawasaki disease is quite true (I am an internist by training) so this may have been missed. It does seem fit on the spectrum of hyper-immune inflammatory responses seen in some of adult patients with severe COVID-19, just some differences leaning more to a Kawasaki-like presentation. As the healthcare providers start looking, it would not be surprising if more cases are identified in young adults.

As more cases are identified, hopefully there will be some more answers to what exactly is going on, and what most effective therapies should be implemented. - Mod.MPP

Overview & stats
----------------
Children have been significantly less affected by COVID-19, as only 1 percent of New Yorkers who have been hospitalized were under 20 years old.

However, the State Department of Health is investigating 157 reported cases and 3 deaths in New York of children -- predominantly school-aged -- experiencing symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome, possibly due to COVID-19.

Of the children displaying these symptoms, 90 percent tested positive for COVID-19 either by diagnostic, antibody testing or both.

Age of cases (updated 21 May 2020)
Age: Percent of cases
less than 1: 6%
1-4: 21%
5-9: 30%
10-14: 25%
15-19: 14%
20-21: 4%

Race and ethnicity of cases (updated 21 May 2020)
Race: Percent of cases
White: 22%
Black: 31%
Other: 17%
Asian: 2%
Unknown: 27%

Ethnicity: Percent of cases

Information for healthcare providers
------------------------------------
Advisory
At the Governor's direction, The State Department of Health issued an advisory about this serious inflammatory disease, called "pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19," to inform healthcare providers of the condition, as well as to provide guidance for testing and reporting.

Healthcare providers, including hospitals, are required to report to the Department of Health all cases of pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome potentially associated with COVID-19 in those under 21 years of age.

Experts are shedding more light on a rare but serious inflammatory syndrome linked to COVID-19 that is affecting children. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) webinar on Tuesday [19 May 2020] detailed symptoms, demographics, and treatment approaches for a 38-case cohort in the United Kingdom and a 33-case cohort from Cohen Children's Medical Center in New York.

Last week [week of 11 May 2020], the CDC released a case definition for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) that includes fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, severe illness requiring hospitalization with multisystem organ involvement and no alternative plausible diagnosis. Criteria also include being positive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), serology or antigen test; or COVID-19 exposure within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.

Presenting symptoms in addition to fever
----------------------------------------
In the cohort from the UK, which has a similar case definition, about 75% of the patients experienced shock, 59.5% had diarrhea, 57% had abdominal involvement, 54% had a rash, 51% had myocardial involvement, 51% required oxygen, 38% had acute kidney injury, and 32% had respiratory symptoms, according to Michael Levin, MBE, PhD, professor of pediatrics and international child health at Imperial College, London.

In the New York cohort described by James Schneider, MD, chief of pediatric critical care medicine at Cohen Children's Medical Center [New York City], about 97% of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms, 76% had shock, 70% had acute kidney injury, 58% had neurocognitive symptoms, 58% had myocardial involvement, 52% required oxygen, 52% had respiratory symptoms, and 48% had coronary artery abnormalities.

The doctors also detailed laboratory findings such as elevated C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, procalcitonin, d-dimer, ferritin, and lactic acid dehydrogenase, and neutrophils and reduced lymphocytes. Overall, "lab results that really reflect a very active inflammatory system," Dr Schneider said.

MIS-C has been compared to Kawasaki disease, and 64% of the New York cohort met the criteria for Kawasaki. However, Drs Levin and Schneider noted that MIS-C patients included older children. They also had higher inflammatory markers, as well as higher rates of shock, coronary abnormalities, and abdominal issues.

In both cohorts, there were mixed results for SARS-CoV-2 PCR and immunoglobulin G (IgG) tests. Evidence of past infection was more common than evidence of acute infection.

Demographics and risk factors
-----------------------------
The median age was 11 years in the UK group and 8.6 years in the New York group and just over 60% of patients were male in each. The UK cohort also included significantly more black patients compared to the population.

While the cohorts included several patients with asthma and some with obesity, most of the patients in each group did not have underlying conditions. "Based on what we've seen in our cohort of 33 ... there really do not seem to be any definitive underlying medical conditions that predispose children to this syndrome," Dr Schneider said. "I think obviously as we continue to collaborate and pool our data, we may be able to find some other trends."

Treatment
---------
Patients in each cohort received supportive care. In the UK group, all patients required fluid resuscitation, 62% received intravenous immunoglobulin, and 51% received corticosteroids.

In the New York group, all patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and 30% received a 2nd dose. About 88% received aspirin, 70% received methylprednisolone, and 42% received enoxaparin.

Both presenters said children responded well to treatment. There was 1 death in the UK cohort and none in the New York cohort.

Report suspected cases
----------------------
Clinicians should report suspected cases to their state, local, or territorial health departments even if the patient also fulfills all or part of the criteria for Kawasaki disease.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Background
Cardiac injury and myocarditis have been described in adults with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is typically minimally symptomatic. We report a series of febrile pediatric patients with acute heart failure potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) as defined by the US Centers for Disease Control.

Methods
Over a 2-month period contemporary with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in France and Switzerland, we retrospectively collected clinical, biological, therapeutic, and early outcomes data in children who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units in 14 centers for cardiogenic shock, left ventricular dysfunction and severe inflammatory state.

Results
A total of 35 children were identified and included in the study. Median age at admission was 10 years (range 2-16 years). Co-morbidities were present in 28% including asthma and overweight. Gastrointestinal symptoms were prominent. Left ventricular ejection fraction was less than 30% in 1/3; 80% required inotropic support with 28% treated with ECMO [extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]. Inflammation markers were suggestive of cytokine storm (interleukin 6 median 135 pg/mL) and macrophage activation (D-dimer median 5284 ng/mL). Mean brain natriuretic peptide was elevated (5743 pg/mL). 31/35 (88%) patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR of nasopharyngeal swab or serology. All patients received intravenous immune globulin, with adjunctive steroid therapy used in 1/3. Left ventricular function was restored in the 25/35 of those discharged from the intensive care unit. No patient died, and all patients treated with ECMO were successfully weaned.

Conclusion
Children may experience an acute cardiac decompensation due to severe inflammatory state following SARS-CoV-2 infection (multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children -- MIS-C). Treatment with immune globulin appears to be associated with recovery of left ventricular systolic function.

[As more physicians are looking, more cases are being identified. And now, with the information on the Washington Post article (item [2] above), I suspect we will learn of more young adults (and possibly not so young adults), who may fit the clinical profile.

The publication by Belhadjer et al (item [5] above) is a case series of 35 children with acute heart failure, fitting the CDC criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children -- MIS-C (also referred to as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome -- PMIS) in France and Switzerland. Thus far there have not been fatalities reported in this group of 35 children, but long term sequelae have not been ruled out yet. The authors noted high levels of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the series of patients and suggested the process was not due to inflammatory myocardial arteritis but rather myocardial edema or stunning. In their discussion, the authors mentioned they implemented a protocol for Emergency Room evaluations of pediatric patients presenting with prolonged and unexplained fever with a rapid N- terminal pro b-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP), even in the absence of cardiac involvement. In the 3 weeks following implementation of this protocol, they saw an increase in patients with less severe forms of disease presenting without heart failure and some with heart failure but without the need for mechanical assistance.

While cases haven't been reported from Wuhan, China, (the 1st "hot spot"), perhaps a look back to see if there was an increase in Kawasaki diagnoses during and following the high COVID-19 activity in the City, although the cumulative documented clinical cases were less than those seen in European and North American hot spots, and in other Asian countries (including Japan), where Kawasaki disease is known to occur more frequently than in Western countries.

As is mentioned above, the SARS-CoV-2 continues to provide us with surprises.... - Mod.MPP
