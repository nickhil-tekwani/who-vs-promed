Lumpy skin disease (LSD) -- adverse post-vaccination reactions, Jordan
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Abutarbush et al have reported LSD-like symptoms in cattle after vaccination with capripoxvirus strains in Jordan (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/doi/10.1111/tbed.12257/). It was reported that farmers were advised to vaccinate cattle with an attenuated sheep pox vaccine (RM65 strain). However, apart from RM65 strain, an unregulated, unlabelled vaccine, which is suspected to be derived from KS-1 strain, another sheep pox vaccine strain, is widely used in the Middle East. This report raises a few issues with LSD spread and its control in the Middle East.

Based on sequence analysis and earlier phylogenetic analysis studies, the authors suspect that KS-1 may be a strain of LSDV [lumpy skin disease virus], and further, they suspect the strain may be sufficiently attenuated to use in sheep but not completely attenuated to use in cattle.

Contribution of this vaccine strain to spread of LSD in the Middle East needs to be assessed. Genome sequencing of LSDV involved in natural outbreaks in the Middle East and the capripox vaccine strains being used for control of sheep pox may give some information regarding this.

The reported adverse reaction due to vaccination with RM65 strain, a strain widely used for control of sheep pox all over the world, is a cause of concern. It was reported that vaccination of cattle with RM65 resulted in LSD-like clinical symptoms.

In view of recent spread of LSDV, there is a need to assess the efficacy of various capripoxvirus vaccines against LSDV and the level of attenuation required to use them as cattle vaccine in LSDV non-endemic areas. Any information regarding this is highly appreciated.

"Abstract
---------
Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is an emerging disease in the Middle East region and has been recently reported in Jordan. The aim of this study was to investigate the adverse reactions that were reported after vaccine administration. Geographical areas enrolled in the study were free of the disease and away from the outbreak governorate. 63 dairy cattle farms, with a total of 19 539 animals, were
included in the study. Of those, 56 farms reported adverse clinical signs after vaccine administration. The duration between vaccine administration and appearance of adverse clinical signs ranged from 1 to 20 days (Mean = 10.3, SD 3.9).

Clinical signs were similar to those observed with natural cases of lumpy skin disease. These were mainly fever, decreased feed intake, decreased milk production and variable sized cutaneous nodules (a few millimetres to around 2 cm in diameter) that could be seen anywhere on the body (head, neck, trunk, perineum), udder, and/or teats. Nodules were raised and firm initially and then formed dry scabs that could be peeled off the skin. The characteristic deep 'sit fast' appearance was rarely seen and most lesions were superficial. Some cattle had swollen lymph nodes, while a few pregnant animals aborted. The percentage of affected cattle ranged from 0.3 to 25 percent (Mean = 8, SD 5.1). Fever, decreased feed intake, and decreased milk production were seen in 83.9, 85.7, and 94.6 percent in cattle on the affected farms, respectively. All affected cattle displayed skin nodules over their entire bodies, while 33.9 and 7.1 percent of the affected farms reported nodular lesions present on the udders and teats, respectively. No mortalities were reported due to vaccine adverse reactions. Duration (course) of clinical signs ranged from 3 to 20 days (Mean = 13.7, SD 4.1).

Two types of LSD vaccines were used by the farmers in this study. The 1st one was a sheep pox virus (SPPV) vaccine derived from the RM65 isolate [Jovivac, manufactured by Jordan Bioindustries Centre (JOVAC)] and the other an unlabelled one, which was later identified using PCR as a strain of lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV). Blood and skin samples collected from cattle vaccinated with the LSDV vaccine were positive for LSDV using both general and species-specific PCR primers, whereas those from cattle vaccinated with the Jovivac vaccine were negative. Adverse reactions observed in cattle after administration of the LSDV vaccine were reported to be more severe than those seen after Jovivac vaccine administration and were comparable with clinical signs observed in natural infections."

We thank Panduranga Rao for bringing the said paper to our attention.

While the observed reactions, caused by live-attenuated vaccines, are certainly undesirable and should be addressed, the communicator's concern that the 2 vaccine strains may "contribute to spread of LSD in the Middle East" is somewhat far-reaching. This is particularly related to the RM65 strain, a vaccine extensively applied for more than 4 decades throughout the Middle East for the vaccination of sheep without reported suspicion of introducing a capripox-like disease in co-habitant cattle.

The paper addresses 2 vaccines applied in Jordan: the officially approved RM65 strain, and an unregulated, unlabelled "LSDV" vaccine. Though postvaccinal reactions were described in animals vaccinated with both vaccines, the authors indicate that the adverse reactions observed in cattle after administration of the "LSDV" vaccine were more severe than those seen after the RM65 vaccine administration and were comparable with clinical signs observed in natural infections. The authors "speculate" that the latter is "non-regulated KS-1 vaccine" and raise the question whether this vaccine had been tested for the presence of other pathogen contaminants such as bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), a test regularly required from commercial, live attenuated vaccines. However, they don't confirm that such contamination has been demonstrated in the unlabelled vaccine. Apparently, the fact that this vaccine was unlabelled does not exclude the possibility that this vaccine was, in fact, a commercial vaccine, unlabelled for some reason, e.g., breaching of Jordanian official requirements for testing/certification.

The use of KS-1 vaccine (also known as "Kenyan sheep & goat vaccine" and "0240") has long been contraindicated for application in _Bos taurus_ cattle due to several observations of serious post vaccination disease signs. In November 1992, this vaccine caused numerous cases of LSD-like signs with decreased milk production in vaccinated dairy cattle holdings around the Gaza strip in Israel. Subscribers are referred to the detailed commentary in posting 20110814.2463 and to refs 1 and 2 below.

LSD has been rapidly spreading, since 2012, throughout the Middle East. In Turkey alone, 234 outbreaks have been reported and mass vaccinations (with the RM65 vaccine?) applied in 17 provinces; on 22 Jul 2014, the disease was declared by Turkey as "endemic". For Turkey's reports, including an interactive map, see http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=14106.

The LSD-infected area in Asia has already reached Azerbaijan and Iran in the east and central Anatolia in the west, directly challenging Central Asia and south-east Europe, as can be seen in the OIE 2012-2014 map at http://tinyurl.com/opmpanr (zoom in).

To the best of our knowledge and as indicated in chapter 2.4.14 (LSD) of OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals 2014, 4 live attenuated strains of capripoxvirus have been, so far, used as vaccines to protect cattle against LSD:

1. LSD virus strain from South Africa (Neethling);
2. RM 65 sheep pox strain;
3. Romanian sheep pox strain;
4. Kenyan sheep and goat vaccine (KS-1 or 0240)

Additional information on these vaccines is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.14_LSD.pdf.

In line with the final comment of the submitter and with the Manual's advise, it is essential to carry out controlled vaccine trials, particularly using the most susceptible breeds in peak lactation, prior to introducing a vaccine strain for the vaccination of cattle in non-endemic areas.

It is high time for a thorough study to select the preferable, safe vaccine(s) for preventive vaccination of susceptible cattle, with particular attention to dairy breeds. Controlled comparative vaccination trials deserve to be considered.
