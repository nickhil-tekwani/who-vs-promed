An update on cryptosporidiosis in Victoria -

So far the Victorian Department of Human Services has been notified of 33
cases of cryptosporidiosis in the last month. All cases were investigated
for possible common exposures. Some cases had not swum at any pools. Four
swimming pools were implicated as a potential source of some infections.

Pool managers of these four pools were advised to treat swimming pool water
by hyperchlorinating, and in one instance to drain the pool and change the
filter media. Some managers of other large swimming complexes have tested
pool backwash water for viable oocysts and detected them, resulting in them
hyperchlorinating. The Department is not currently advocating testing
swimming pool water for _Cryptosporidium_ due to the uncertainty associated
with the test and its high cost.

The Department has sent guidelines on prevention of cryptosporidiosis to all
municipal council environmental health officers and swimming pool managers.
These have been modified from those produced by CDC
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dpd/pool_op.htm>). They advise pool managers to
follow proper sanitation guidelines, put up signs requesting people
experiencing diarrhoea recently not to swim, and to have a written plan for
faecal accidents.

Contrary to some of the media coverage, we are not seeing widespread illness
throughout the state. We have seen much larger numbers of cases in previous
years. It is highly unlikely that a third of all swimming pool patrons are
afflicted with cryptospordiosis, as reported in the previous posting.
Despite all this _Cryptosporidium_ certainly has captured public interest.
