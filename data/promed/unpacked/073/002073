Newcastle disease affects wild birds in Russian Far East
--------------------------------------------------------
A growing number of wild birds in the Russian Far East region of Khabarovsk
are catching an acute viral disease known as Newcastle disease, a local
expert said. Birds of several species, including grouse, are rarely sighted
there now because so many are dying from the disease, Leonid Ivanov, a
local official responsible for combatting the virus, told AFP. "Tests show
that the Newcastle disease virus is not only circulating in wild species
but also among pet birds and pigeons," he said.

Ivanov added that Newcastle disease, or pneumoencephalitis, could prove
just as devastating for poultry stocks as bird flu, which has led to the
culling of millions of chickens worldwide. The 2 diseases produce similar
symptoms. The health authorities in Khabarovsk have urged poultry farmers
to have their birds vaccinated.

[Russia reported to the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) 2
outbreaks of Newcastle disease (NCD) in 2003, both on its western
frontiers: the 1st in Lipetskaya oblast (May), the 2nd in Belgorodskaya
oblast (October). Recently, another outbreak was unofficially reported from
the Ukrainian border (see ref).

Khabarovsk is adjacent to the north eastern border of the Chinese province
Heilongjang (capital: Harbin). From Dr Ivanov's cited information it may be
assumed that serological and/or virological investigations have been
carried out in various species; however, dying grouse and other "wild
birds" could also indicate avian influenza. Available details of laboratory
tests would be helpful, particularly the identity of virus strain(s)
involved. - Mod.AS]
