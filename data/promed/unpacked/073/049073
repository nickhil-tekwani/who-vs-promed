The number of people infected with trichinellosis has increased in
the Krasnoyarsk region. Last year [2006], 37 cases of trichinosis
were registered in the region, and, for the same period, the total
number of cases registered in Russia was 206. The source of infection
is meat from wild animals.
The clinical course of trichinellosis in humans is severe and
frequently has a lethal outcome. The clinical course of the disease
includes fever with temperatures up to 39 C, periorbital edema,
muscle pain and often skin rash, headaches, and diarrhea. Experts
from Rosslelhoznadzor [The Federal Agency for Veterinary and
Phytosanitary Supervision] warn inhabitants that consumption of meat
from wild boars, bears and badgers without veterinary examination can
lead to infection.

[The Krasnoyarsk region is located in the Eastern-Siberian part of
Russia in the middle of the Eurasian continent. It has a total area
of approximately 2.3 million square kms, covering 13.6 percent of the
whole of Russia's territory. The region stretches 3000 kms from north
to south crossing 4 climatic zones, from the polar Arctic Ocean
islands to the southern Sayan spurs. The main river of the region is
the Yenisei. The region is diverse, with arctic ice, tundra and
forest tundra. - Mod.NP]
[In February 2006, ProMED reported that 1383 cases (2 fatal) of
trichinellosis were reported in the Russian Federation during 1995 to
1997 and 514 cases in 2004. _Trichinella pseudospiralis_ is found in
sylvatic animals (raccoon dog, corsac fox, tiger cat, tawny eagle,
and rook) in remote regions (Caucasus, Kazakhstan). It is well known
that wild boars, bears, badgers and other carnivores have a high rate
of infection with _Trichinella_. The question is whether domestic
pigs are a source of some of the human infections. The cases could be
avoided by veterinary inspection of meat from wild animals. - Mod.EP]
