The enterovirus 71 outbreak with signs of hand, foot and mouth disease
which occurred in China has spread to Mongolia and is infecting more and
more children each day. A report from Sun 11 May 2008 shows that, in total,
183 children from the capital city [Ulaanbataar] and provincal levels have
been infected and have been admitted to hospitals for treatment. Also,
there is a suspicion of adults being infected with the virus. A 22 year old
and a 43 year old have been referred to hospital for a possible infection.
A presidential order to close (quarantine) schools from 1st to 5th grades
and kindergartens for an unlimited time was made on 12 May 2008.

[A previous report of 7 May 2008 recorded that a small number of cases of
hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) had been diagnosed in the Mongolian
Autonomous Region of China (formerly Inner Mongolia). Now HFMD has spread
northwards into Mongolia (formerly Outer Mongolia). As in China, and some
other parts of Asia, the etiologic agent is human enterovirus 71. So far,
no deaths have been recorded. However, unusually, a small number of adults
may be cases of HFMDV infection.
