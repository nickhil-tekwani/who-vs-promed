Feral cats identified as possible Willow Creek rabies source
------------------------------------------------------------
Feral unvaccinated cats may be behind a rabies infection that sent a
Willow Creek resident to the hospital 2 weeks ago, according to local
health officials. But health officials also say that they may never
know how exactly the victim contracted the disease.

The victim is currently in stable condition at UC Davis Medical
Center and is improving, according to the Humboldt County Department
of Health and Human Services. The patient's family and medical
personnel who came into contact with her are being vaccinated against
the disease. Officials also vaccinated 2 other individuals who were at
risk from animal bites.

Even though feral cats may be the primary source of the disease,
county health officer Ann Lindsay said officials are investigating
other wild and domestic animals for signs of rabies as well.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the
case was a rabies infection on Fri 6 May 2011. It is thought to be the
1st-ever confirmed case of human rabies in Humboldt County, according
to health officials. Bats and gray foxes are the usual carriers of
rabies in Humboldt County, said Dave Lancaster, a wildlife biologist
with the California Department of Fish and Game. According to county
public health, which tests animals for rabies, about 5 gray foxes and
one bat tested positive for rabies last year [2010] in Humboldt
County. In 2009 more than 35 gray foxes in the county tested positive
for rabies. Almost 40 skunks also tested positive for rabies in 2009.
So far this month, Humboldt County Animal Control received 5 calls for
potentially rabid animals, said Officer Andre Hale. The calls turned
out to be false alarms, she said.

Usually, foxes will contract a passive form of the virus, Lancaster
said. In that instance, the animal may have motor control problems and
may just be looking for a place to die. Skunks are also susceptible to
the passive rabies strain [reaction?], he said. Last year, though,
Lancaster and officers with the Arcata Police Department encountered a
fox with the aggressive form of rabies. "It had been chasing bicycles
and cars in the street in Bayside," he said. "It's very simple with
the aggressive strain, it's just aggressive behavior. If it's chasing
you, and you try to run away, there you go."

If a potential rabies case is reported, usually local law enforcement
will go to the area and kill the animal. In some cases, Fish and Game
wardens will also be called in, Lancaster said. Many people who have
problems with animals will take it upon themselves to trap and move
them. According to Lancaster, this is illegal and often makes a
disease outbreak worse. Leaving pet food and water outside can also
spread diseases between domestic animals and wildlife. "It can also
increase the density of wild animals," Lancaster said. "The higher the
numbers, the greater chance of disease because (the animals) get
stressed." People shouldn't handle wild animals, Lancaster said. If a
resident finds a dead animal, they should bury it next to where it was
found, using rubber gloves and filling the hole with the soil the
animal was laying on, he said. After that, residents should wash the
tools they used.

Residents who come into contact with a potentially rabid wild animal
should contact their doctors. If the animal is dead, residents can
call the county Division of Environmental Health.

[This reports is devoid of clinical data and specific information on
the source of the victim's infection. It would appear that a feral cat
has been identified as the source of the victim's rabies virus
infection by a process of exclusion of other potential vectors. It
would be relevant to know if there has been any genetic analysis of
the infecting virus that might substantiate the conclusion that the
vector was a feral cat.

It is not stated when the patient's exposure occurred or whether (and
when) she received post-exposure prophylaxis. The patient's condition
is reported to be stable. Further information is awaited.

Humboldt County is a county in the state of California, located on
the far North Coast 200 miles north of San Francisco. Its location is
