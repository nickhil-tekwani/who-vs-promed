27 people including 8 children from Kampung [village] Basong and
Kampung Pasir Dula here have been admitted to the Hulu Terengganu
Hospital (HTT) after they were suspected to have contracted hepatitis
A.

Terengganu Health director Dr Anuwa Sulaiman said 5 others from the
same 2 kampungs were given outpatient treatment. "All the patients,
aged between 2-50, are reported to be in stable condition," he told
Bernama [the Malaysian Nation News Agency]. He said the outbreak 1st
surfaced 3 days before Aidiladha (6 Nov 2011), with the latest case
detected yesterday [Fri 11 Nov 2011]. He said the symptoms were
determined to be that of hepatitis A and not leptospirosis (rat urine
disease).

One of the victims, a 17-year-old female who is due to sit for the
Sijil Pelajaran Examination (SPM) tomorrow [11 Nov 2011], said she was
disappointed this had to happen because it affected her preparations
for the examination.

Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe
illness. It is spread by faecal-oral transmission when a person
ingests food or drink contaminated by an infected person's faeces. The
disease is closely associated with poor sanitation and a lack of
personal hygiene. Blood borne transmission of hepatitis A virus
infection occurs but is much less common. Waterborne outbreaks, though
infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or
inadequately treated water. Casual contact among people does not
spread the virus.

In the outbreak in Hulu Terengganu district, in view of the fact that
leptospirosis was considered as an alternate diagnosis, the wide age
range of the affected individuals, and the involvement of 2 villages
together suggest food or water borne infection rather than spread by
personal contact.

There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A virus infection.
Recovery from symptoms following infection may be slow and take
several weeks or months. Therapy is aimed at maintaining comfort and
adequate nutritional balance, including replacement of fluids that are
lost from vomiting and diarrhoea.

Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease. According to the World
Health Organisation, several hepatitis A vaccines are available
internationally. All are similar in terms of how well they protect
people from the virus and their side-effects. No vaccine is licensed
for children younger than one year of age (see:
