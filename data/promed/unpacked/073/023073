WEST NILE VIRUS VACCINE, BIRD REACTION - CANADA (02)

I wonder if what one is seeing is _in vivo_ hemagglutination, since
this virus hemagglutinates goose cells in vitro. Perhaps it attaches
to the lorikeet cells _in vivo_.

some serology on the vaccine in avians could provide a knowledgeable
comment. - Mod.TG]
