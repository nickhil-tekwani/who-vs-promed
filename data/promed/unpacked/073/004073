Amid mounting reports of irregular poultry deaths in many areas, leading
virologist Professor Prasert Thongcharoen expressed strong doubts yesterday
about the accuracy of official reports of avian-flu tests on dead birds by
livestock authorities.
"From my experience, when they say 'no, nothing' it means 'yes, it is' [bird
flu]," he told The Nation in a telephone interview after returning from a trip
to Phitsanulok, one of the provinces where mass deaths of poultry have been
reported recently.
"I will give it 8 out of 10 that what has caused such an abnormal pattern of
poultry deaths was it [the bird-flu virus]."
Prasert has previously confronted the government by telling the media that a
patient sent to Siriraj Hospital, where he works as a professor of
microbiology, had died of avian flu while the government kept insisting the
virus did not exist in the country. The government later admitted that the
death was the 1st case in Thailand of a human dying from the virus.
"To be fair, they might have checked the samples and simply could not detect
the virus," said Prasert. "Yet, once again, things are so obvious."
Some epidemiologists at the Public Health Ministry have complained to Prasert,
their adviser, that they were put under pressure to travel to examine areas
where poultry deaths were reported.
Since the Public Health Ministry is not in a position to test for the avian-
flu virus in birds, the best they could do is to be pro-active in screening
patients for possible infection, he said.
Meanwhile, Dr Paijit Warachit, head of the Medical Sciences Department that is
responsible for testing suspected human cases of bird flu, said 19 tests for
the lethal H5N1 virus had been negative. 8 had the H1N1 influenza strain
[when? - Mod.AS].
At the moment, he said, there were between 10 and 20 cases sent for testing
per day and none had yet been positive.
The department might need to dispatch a mobile testing unit to Phichit, which
has the highest number of samples to be tested.
