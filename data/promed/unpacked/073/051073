[1] Sierra Leone: Ebola virus variant, Bombali virus
Date: Fri 27 Jul 2018
From: Tracey Goldstein <tgoldstein@ucdavis.edu>, Simon Anthony <sja2127@cumc.columbia.edu> [edited]


A novel ebolavirus species has been identified in bats in Sierra Leone, providing the strongest evidence to date that bats are the natural hosts of these viruses. This is not the virus that caused the outbreak in West Africa from 2013-2016, which belongs to the species _Zaire ebolavirus_. The new virus, called Bombali virus (BOMV), was found in insectivorous bats (5 individuals; 2 species: _Chaerephon pumilus_ and _Mops condylurus_) roosting inside people's houses in the Bombali district of Sierra Leone. Based on laboratory experiments, researchers report that the virus has the potential to infect human cells -- but stress it is not known whether it has actually infected anyone or if it is pathogenic. The government of Sierra Leone and international partners are engaging local communities to convey what is known about the new virus, and how to live safely with bats. The discovery of the Bombali virus brings the known number of ebolavirus species to 6.

Bombali virus was discovered by UC [University of California] Davis (http://www.onehealthinstitute.net) working with Columbia University (http://www.mailman.columbia.edu), the Government of Sierra Leone, the University of Makeni, and Metabiota as part of the PREDICT Project (http://www.predict.global), funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

The role of bats in the environment
-----------------------------------
People should not attempt to kill or eradicate bats in response to this discovery. While bats have been implicated as reservoirs for a number of infectious pathogens, they play important roles as providers of ecosystem services through pollination of native and agricultural crops, reduction of insect pests that also spread disease and damage crops, and consumption of mosquitoes and other pests that feed on people and livestock. Killing or disturbing bats in their natural habitat could actually increase the risk of transmission of this new virus, as has been seen in studies of Marburg and rabies viruses. Engagement with local communities has occurred throughout the project and meetings with communities to share plans and answer questions about Bombali virus and how to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus are ongoing.

The government of Sierra Leone has announced that a new species of Ebola has been discovered there in bats. It has been called, provisionally, the Bombali virus, after a district in the north of the country.

There's no evidence the new virus has infected people, although EcoHealth Alliance, an environmental nonprofit group involved in the discovery, said on Twitter that it has the potential to infect human cells.

The discovery was made by scientists from the University of California at Davis and Columbia University as part of a U.S.-funded effort to find unknown viruses that have the potential to cause outbreaks in people.

A scientific paper detailing the discovery is in the publication pipeline and is currently under embargo, the group's CEO, Peter Daszak, told STAT.

The normal process for announcing the discovery of a new virus is through a peer-reviewed journal, where the scientists making the claim lay out details of how they found the virus -- or in this case, genetic evidence of a virus -- and the work they did to prove that it was new, and not simply a new strain of an already known pathogen.

In this case, Sierra Leone, which had been notified of the discovery, wanted to 1st make the announcement to local press on Thursday [26 Jul 2018].

"They want to preempt negative rumors and are rolling out education programs to reduce potential for spillover," Daszak said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have received samples from bats that tested positive for the Bombali virus by polymerase chain-reaction testing, said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the agency. Scientists at the Atlanta-based agency will begin additional testing on the samples soon.

Sierra Leone is one of 3 countries in West Africa that was engulfed in a devastating Ebola outbreak in 2014 and 2015. The outbreak was caused by the Ebola virus known as Ebola Zaire. Prior to this new discovery, there were 5 known species of Ebola: the Zaire virus, now simply called Ebola; Sudan ebolavirus; Bundibugyo; Tai Forest; and Reston.

The Ebola and Sudan viruses have caused the most known outbreaks; Bundibugyo, discovered in 2007, has only caused 2. There has only ever been one known case of Tai Forest ebolavirus infection, in the Ivory Coast in 1994. The Reston virus, found in the Philippines, can infect people but does not appear to sicken them. It kills non-human primates, however, and can also infect pigs.

Evidence that there is a 6th species was found in several Angolan free-tail bats, Daszak said. These bats live in sub-Saharan Africa, where most Ebola activity occurs.

The scientists did not manage to extract live viruses from the bats, he said. Viral fragments -- RNA -- were detected; there was enough material to sequence "an almost complete genome," Daszak said.

Bats are believed to be the natural reservoir of all Ebola species, but, to date, no one has managed to isolate live Ebola viruses from bats. However, scientists have found Marburg viruses in Egyptian fruit bats. Marburg and Ebola are related; both are members of the filovirus family.

[Many thanks to Drs. Goldstein and Anthony for sharing their discovery with ProMED. Media reports on this new ebolavirus in bats in Sierra Leone were also submitted by ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall and Greg Folkers of the US NIH, NIAID. We appreciate their contributions.

Ebolavirus is a zoonosis, with bats strongly considered to be the reservoir host. Spillover to humans occurs through contact in hunting and butchering bats and other wildlife. The Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 may have gotten started with a child playing with a small insect-eating bat. But involvement of bats has not been definitively proven by Koch's postulates; that is, the infectious virus has never been isolated from bats, until this new finding.

This newly discovered virus is not known to infect humans, but it is further evidence that bats may serve as ebolavirus reservoirs. Since the bats where Bombali virus has been isolated live in people's homes, one must conclude either that the infection is asymptomatic, or people have not become infected. Since the virus was able to infect human cells in the laboratory, people can be tested for antibodies to the virus. We look forward to further studies to elucidate the importance of this exciting finding. - Mod.LK]

As 42 days (2 incubation periods) have passed since the last possible exposure to a confirmed Ebola virus disease case, on 24 Jul 2018, the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga announced the end of the outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and Regional Director for Africa, Dr Matshidiso Moeti, commend the country and partners in the response against the outbreak while urging them to extend this success to combatting other diseases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

In contrast to previous Ebola virus disease outbreaks in the country, this outbreak involved 3 health zones, including an urban centre with river connections to the capital and to neighbouring countries, as well as remote rainforest villages. Within hours of the outbreak being declared on 8 May 2018, WHO advanced more than USD 2 million from its Contingency Fund for Emergencies, deployed a team to augment capacity in the field, and activated an emergency incident management system. More than 2/3rds of the 360 people deployed to respond came from within the WHO African Region, including vaccination teams from Guinea.

From 20 through 21 Jul 2018, WHO supported a workshop to harmonize, reconcile, and validate the wide range of data arising from the outbreak response. The workshop brought together teams responsible for coordination, surveillance, case management, laboratory investigations and vaccinations in Mbandaka, Bikoro, Itipo, Iboko, and Kinshasa to share their findings, and harmonize data records. As a result of this exercise, changes to the number of confirmed and probable cases, including deaths among these cases, were agreed. These changes only affected the reclassification of data records of past cases, who were otherwise known to field investigators and received full follow-up as part of the response.

As of 24 Jul 2018, a total of 54 Ebola virus disease cases (38 confirmed and 16 probable) were reported, with illness onset between 5 Apr and 2 Jun 2018 (Figure 1 [figures available at the source URL above]). Of these cases, 33 died (overall case fatality ratio: 61 percent), including 17 deaths among confirmed cases. Cases were reported from 3 health zones (Figure 2): Bikoro (n=21; 10 confirmed, 11 probable), Iboko (n=29; 24 confirmed, 5 probable), and Wangata (n=4; all confirmed). 7 cases were health care workers, of whom 2 died.

Public health response
----------------------
From 3 through 5 Jul 2018, the Ministry of Health, with support from WHO and partners, conducted a strategic operations review to assess the current epidemiological situation, evaluate progress against the Ebola virus disease Strategic Response Plan, engage in initial lesson learning, and prioritize key activities and resources for continued vigilance in affected areas. A key product of the operations review was the development of a government-led Consolidation and Stabilization Plan (August - October 2018) to transition resources deployed, strengthen emergency response capacity and preparedness, and overall resilience of the health systems.

This plan includes:
- maintaining and strengthening surveillance capacity to rapidly detect and respond to potential new cases of Ebola virus disease, including for points of entry and the locations of areas where travellers congregate and interact with the local population, and in neighbouring provinces and countries;
- strengthening infection prevention and control, as well as water, sanitation, and health (WASH), in targeted health facilities;
- maintaining evidence-based standards for case management (clinical care of patients and access to monitored use of investigational therapeutics);
- maintaining local laboratory capacity for confirmation of new potential cases and management of care to survivors;
- providing health services and psychosocial care for survivors and their families;
- strengthening community engagement to improve knowledge of and response to Ebola and epidemic-prone diseases in targeted health zones;
- improving food security in health zones affected by Ebola virus disease;
- leveraging resources and knowledge from the 1st 2 phases of the response to facilitate the development of a National Health Security and Resilience Plan, based on previous assessments and the after action review which is planned from 10 through 14 Sep 2018.

As part of this next phase of the public health response, WHO will support the Ministry of Health in leading an After-Action Review with partners and donors to engage in lessons learning and determine how best to leverage resources and knowledge from the first two phases of the response to strengthen health systems and national resilience under a National Action Plan for Heath Security.

WHO risk assessment
-------------------
The latest WHO assessment concluded that the current Ebola virus disease outbreak has been contained, considering that 42 days (2 maximum incubation periods) have elapsed since the date of the second negative test of the last case confirmed case on 12 Jun 2018. Under the Consolidation and Stabilisation Strategic Plan adopted by the Ministry for Health, enhanced surveillance, a program for long-term Ebola survivor care, and other response mechanisms, remain in place following the end of the outbreak declaration to maintain increased vigilance and contribute to resilience of the health system. WHO considers the public health risk associated with the recent Ebola virus disease outbreak to be low at national, regional and global levels. Ebola virus disease is, however, endemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and may re-emerge at any time.

WHO advice
----------
WHO advises the following risk reduction measures as an effective way to reduce Ebola virus disease transmission:
- Reducing the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption.
- Reducing the risk of human-to-human transmission from direct or close contact with people with Ebola symptoms, particularly with their bodily fluids. Gloves and appropriate personal protective equipment should be worn when taking care of ill patients at home. Regular hand washing is required after visiting patients in hospital, as well as after taking care of patients at home.
- Reducing the risk of possible sexual transmission, based on further analysis of ongoing research and consideration by the WHO Advisory Group on the Ebola Virus Disease Response, WHO recommends that male survivors of Ebola virus disease practice safe sex and hygiene for 12 months from onset of symptoms or until their semen tests negative twice for Ebola virus. Contact with body fluids should be avoided and washing with soap and water is recommended. WHO does not recommend isolation of male or female convalescent patients whose blood has been tested negative for Ebola virus.

WHO continues to advise against any restriction of travel and trade to the Democratic Republic of the Congo based on the currently available. WHO has monitored travel and trade restrictions during this outbreak and recorded 26 countries that put in place entry screening measures, while no country has implemented any travel or trade restrictions, as recommended by the Emergency Committee.
