Nonpolio Enterovirus and Human Parechovirus Surveillance --- United
States, 2006-2008
------------------------
Enteroviruses, members of the famlly _Picornaviridae_, are common
viruses associated with clinical manifestations ranging from mild
respiratory symptoms to serious conditions, including aseptic
meningitis, encephalitis, neonatal sepsis, and acute flaccid
paralysis. Approximately 100 serotypes of nonpolio enteroviruses have
been recognized (1), and some viruses previously classified as
enteroviruses, namely echovirus 22 and 23, recently have been
reclassified as human parechoviruses (HPeVs), a different genus
within the family _Picornaviridae_. This report describes trends in
nonpolio enterovirus and HPeV detections during 2006--2008, based on
data from 2 laboratory-based surveillance systems, the National
Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) and, for the 1st time, the
National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS).

As in previous years, approximately 70 percent of detections occurred
during July--October, the peak enterovirus season. The 5 most common
enterovirus serotypes (coxsackievirus B1 [CVB1], echovirus 6,
echovirus 9, echovirus 18, and coxsackievirus A9) accounted for 54
percent of total serotyped detections.

During 2006--2008, southern states reported the most serotyped
enterovirus detections, followed by mid-western states, western
states, and the northeastern states. In 2007 and 2008, CVB1 was the
predominant serotype detected, accounting for 24 percent and 19
percent of overall detections, respectively. In 2007, CVB1 was
implicated in an outbreak of serious neonatal infections in the
United States (2). Understanding trends in enterovirus and HPeV
circulation can help clinicians decide when to test for these
infections. Also, more timely reporting of data could help public
health officials recognize outbreaks associated with these viruses.

Enterovirus or HPeV serotypes were specified for 1171 (72 percent)
NESS reports. By region, southern states had the most serotyped
detections reported, accounting for 418 of 1167 (36 percent) reports
for which state information was provided, followed by 373 (32
percent) detections from mid-western states, 222 (19 percent) from
western states, and 154 (13 percent) from northeastern states. The 5
most common enterovirus serotypes accounted for 54 percent of total
detections with a known serotype in 2006--2008.

Overall, during 2006--2008, CVB1 was the most commonly detected
enterovirus identified in 235 (17 percent) of 1171 specimens tested.
In 2007, CVB1 was detected in 22 mostly southern and western states;
2 states reported 70 (51 percent) of 137 detections. In 2008, CVB1
was detected in 10 states; one state reported 15 (34 percent) of 44
detections. During 2006--2008, 3 public health laboratories and CDC's
Picornavirus Laboratory reported a total of 21 HPeV type 1 (HPeV1)
detections. HPeV1 was one of the 15 most common enteroviruses
reported during the surveillance period but was detected in less than
2 percent of specimens. During the surveillance period, only 14 cases
of enterovirus 71 (EV71), a virus that has caused widespread
outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease in several Asian countries
(3), were reported to NESS, and it was not included as one of the 15
most common serotypes reported.

During July 2007--December 2008, a total of 3192 (3 percent) of the
108 798 reports sent to NREVSS were positive for enterovirus. 100
laboratories reported testing for enteroviruses to NREVSS. During
this period, the highest proportion of detections was reported during
July-- October. The proportion of enterovirus-positive specimens was
similar across regions.

MMWR Editorial Note
----------------------
The findings in this report are consistent with previous trends
regarding the most commonly detected enterovirus serotypes (4).
During 2006--2008, CVB1 became the predominant enterovirus serotype
identified, found in several states, and concentrated in a few.
Common clinical presentations of CVB1 include aseptic meningitis,
myocarditis, pleurodynia, and hand, foot, and mouth disease. CVB1
generally shows an epidemic pattern of circulation with irregular
intervals of increased circulation usually lasting 2--3 years (4).
During 1970--2005, CVB1 accounted for approximately 2 percent of
reports with known serotype, with an increase of CVB1 observed in the
early 1990s and then again in the early 2000s (4). In 2007, increased
detections of CVB1 reported to NESS led to an investigation that
identified severe neonatal disease and deaths associated with CVB1
infection in multiple states (2,5).

A small proportion of cases have resulted in encephalitis and death.
In the United States, small clusters of serious disease were detected
during 2003--2005 (6). Although there was an increase in reported
EV71 detections in the United States during 2006--2008, EV71
detections were uncommon.

HPeV1 usually has been associated with mild gastrointestinal and
respiratory symptoms, meningitis, and neonatal sepsis (7). HPeV1 was
one of the 15 most common detections during 2006--2008; no other HPeV
types were reported during that period. HPeV cannot be detected by
EV- specific assays. CDC's Picornavirus Laboratory has performed the
majority of HPeV typing reported to NESS but has worked with clinical
and state laboratories to enhance their HPeV diagnostic and molecular
typing assays (8) to improve detections and enhance parechovirus
surveillance.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 4 limitations.
1st, enteroviral infections other than poliovirus infections are not
nationally notifiable in the United States. NESS is a passive system
that relies on voluntary participation from laboratories, so findings
are not necessarily representative of national or regional
enterovirus activity. 2nd, the findings are limited by the lack of
clinical information; however, most detections likely represent
serious disease because cerebral spinal fluid was the most common
source of detection. 3rd, most testing is performed during the summer
months; circulation during other parts of the year might go
undetected.

[Although not current, these data are posted because comparable data
have not been available. More timely reporting of data could help
public health officials recognize outbreaks associated with these
viruses. Understanding trends in enterovirus and human parechovirus
circulation could help public health officials to recognize outbreaks
associated with these viruses (such as in the case with an outbreak
of serious neonatal infections associated with CVB1 in 2007).

Interesting findings from this survey are that during the period
2006--2008, the 5 most frequently detected enteroviruses were
coxsackievirus B1, echovirus 6, echovirus 9, echovirus 18, and
coxsackievirus A9; and these accounted for 54 percent of total known
serotyped detections during that period. EV71, which has caused
widespread outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease in many Asian
countries since 1997, is uncommon in the United States.

This study also revealed that human parechovirus type1 (HPeV1) was
one of the 15 most common viruses detected during 2006--2008,
although this virus is not detectable by the routine
enterovirus-specific assays available in many diagnostic labs.
