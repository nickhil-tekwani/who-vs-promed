During my vacation in Madrid, Spain I have learned that many cases of
a respiratory infection are being diagnosed in a northern area of
Madrid (Spain). It causes flu-like symptoms with fever and very severe
coughing. I believe it spreads rapidly (contagious) as it is affecting
many household members.

[It is not possible to speculate what the etiological agent in these
cases might be without more detailed information. ProMED-mail thanks
Mar Velarde for the information, and requests that numbers of cases, a
description of the affected cohorts, and clinical pictures, time of
case occurrence and, most importantly, a diagnosis of the etiological
agent involved, be provided as they become available.

Madrid in Spain can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/0Gtz. -
