The death toll from Japanese encephalitis (JE) in Assam reached 101 on Friday [19 Jul 2019] even as the state continues to battle flood fury caused by the monsoon rain. State health department officials said special measures are being taken in flood-affected areas to prevent the spread of the disease.

On Friday [19 Jul 2019], the daily report from the National Health Mission (NHM) Assam noted 4 more JE deaths. It showed a total of 1569 cases of acute encephalitis syndrome cases, including 439 JE cases, since April this year [2019]. Last year [2018], there were 509 cases and 94 deaths in Assam as a result of JE [virus], which is transmitted by mosquitoes.

"Kamrup (Rural) district, in the vicinity of Guwahati, has recorded 11 deaths, the highest in the state," said Chittaranjan Pathak, state programme officer, National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme. Information furnished by NHM showed Lakhimpur has recorded 37 JE-positive cases, the highest in the state. Pathak said the transmission of JE showed a downward trend and [the] situation has improved. "In flood-affected areas, our colleagues are trying their level best. In all flood relief camps extensive fogging is done and awareness campaigns are being held," he said adding so far there were no reports of any infections in the camps.

As [of] Friday [19 Jul 2019], as many as 4.88 million people have been affected by the floods while another 147 833 people have taken shelter in relief camps across the state. A large number of flood-affected people are living in shanties on high grounds with their animals, including pigs, in immediate vicinity. "Pigs are the carriers of the JE virus," said SM Sarmah, joint director, health, Kamrup (Rural). He, however, hoped that the floods would have washed away the mosquito larvae, thereby reducing the chances of transmission of the disease.

"We hope the situation will improve due to floods and mosquito breeding will go down," he said. In his district, a part of which is reeling under floods, no new JE infection has been reported since 13 Jul [2019].

[The numbers of Japanese encephalitis (JE) cases had been accelerating in Assam state over the first 2 weeks of July [2019]. Now, it will be interesting to see if the numbers of JE cases continue to go down after the floods. It is reasonable to assume that the larvae of the vector culex mosquitoes have been washed away by the flood waters. It is curious that no mention is made of vaccination campaigns in the affected areas. Vaccination is the most effective measure to prevent JE virus infection.

There continues to be an increase in cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) as well. There is no indication of what the etiology of those AES cases might be. As noted previously, many times the determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. Some cases of AES are frequently attributed to JE, but many are of undefined etiology. AES has continued to be attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heatstroke, lychee fruit consumption, and scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_). A recent publication states that dengue virus is one of the 3 commonest agents identified in AES, but existing surveillance for AES does not include routine testing for dengue. Until the etiology (or etiologies) of these AES cases is determined, effective and efficient prevention of these cases will not be possible. - Mod.TY
