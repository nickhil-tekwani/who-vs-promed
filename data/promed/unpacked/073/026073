Bayelsa: Measles Epidemic Death Toll Now 25
----------------------------------------------------------
Despite claims by the Bayelsa State Government that it has curtailed
the recent outbreak of measles in Oweikurogha, Southern Ijaw Local
Government Area (LGA) from spreading to neighbouring communities, the
death toll of those affected had risen to 25. The initial outbreak of
the epidemic last week [1st reported on Thu 28 Jan 2009] reportedly
resulted in the loss of 18 lives, including children and teenagers,
according to close sources in the predominantly river side community,
who added that people are already fleeing to neighbouring areas.

The State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Azipabu Godbless Eruani while
speaking to newsmen during a briefing at his office on Thursday [28
Jan 2010] confirmed the incident, but could not give the exact
casualty figure. He said doctors with Medecins Sans Frontieres have
moved in to help rescue the situation from escalating.

Eruani explained that in order to check the epidemic from spreading,
his ministry has sent Vitamin A and other relief materials to boost
the immune system of the villagers, just as he expressed dismay that
some villagers refuse to bring out their children to be immunised when
some health workers visited the area.

"As we speak the situation is under control, the Medecins Sans
Frontieres staff have also visited the community, but we have a
setback. Some people do not want to bring out their children to be
immunised when our health workers went there to stop the problem from
spreading," he added. The health boss however pointed out that the
government would mobilize staff to carry out an aggressive
enlightenment campaign in the area and other parts of the state to
ensure that people of the state understand the importance of
immunization.

Describing the measles outbreak as an international problem, the
Commissioner noted that more health workers have been deployed to
neighbouring communities so that the scourge does not spread to
neighbouring areas. He called on people of the state not to panic, as
the situation is under control.

"When this government came on board, a major focus was to improve
health care, which underscores why the Chief Timipre Sylva-led
administration is building new primary health centres and renovating
existing ones so as to bring them to standard," Dr. Eruani said. The
Daily Champion learnt that the situation is made worse as the only
government health centre in the community has been overstretched by
the influx of patients there, while the belief of the people has
precluded parents from bringing out their children, hence the increase
in death; as they believe in supernatural healing.

Close sources in the Oweikurogha community said if the health centre
there is upgraded into a full-fledged hospital with doctors and
nurses, such scourges would be readily controlled. They feared that
more people could contract diseases, hence some people sought refuge
in nearby communities.

[Previously on 28 Jan 2010 the Bayelsa State Commissioner for Health
said the epidemic had been contained and assured residents of the area
that it would not spread to other parts of the state. He could not
confirm the number of the dead at that time, saying the claims about
the number of victims in Owukoro could not be verified by the team
from the Health Ministry. The above press report of 2 Feb 2010
indicates that there had been 15 fatalities at the time of the
Commissioner's statement, and that number has since increased to 25 in
the ensuing 5 days.

The local health authorities are clearly aware of the problem and the
remedy and have the assistance of Medecins Sans Frontieres. They are
hampered on the one hand by lack of facilities and on the other by
reluctance of the local population to allow their children to be
vaccinated. Education of the local population will be an essential
preliminary to successful eradication of measles virus infection in
the state.
