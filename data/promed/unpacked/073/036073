Alarming increase in minor pests causes crop wilting in many parts of Hyderabad
-------------------------------------------
Stem-rot disease hits paddy crop in East Godavari
Significant climate changes over the past few years have led to
'alarming' increase in the hitherto minor or unknown pests that are
causing wilting and other effects on the crops in different parts of
the State. For instance, a paddy crop in over 45 000 hectares in East
Godavari district was infected by stem-rot disease in just 3 days
during the previous season.
"There is no alternative but to burn the affected plants to ensure
that the disease does not spread to others," agriculture commissioner
Poonam Malakondaiah said. Addressing a press conference here on Wed
[28 Mar 2007], she said the introduction of genetically modified (GM)
crops, engineered for a specific trait, was also resulting in new
pest problems. This called for a regular monitoring and surveillance
system to know the status of pests, which was a prerequisite for
effective implementation of integrated pest management.
The department was planning to take up awareness programmes on the
new pests during the Rythu Chaitanya Yatras between 16 Apr and 5 May
[2007] wherein farmers would be educated on different aspects of
crops and cropping pattern. In addition, it was decided to prepare
village agriculture action plans by 5 Apr [2007] and strengthen pest
surveillance mechanism in every district through the seed testing
labs to test genetic purity of the seeds.

[Stem Rot is caused by the fungus _Sclerotium oryzae_. It occurs in
circular to irregular areas in fields and causes premature death and
lodging of the plants. Stalks weaken at the water line and then
break, making harvest difficult. Plants infected early yield poorly,
and a high percentage of plants is killed. Control measures include
crop rotation, use of early maturing varieties, fluctuating the flood
water level, avoiding excessive rates of nitrogen, and rice stubble
destruction. Some fungicides help to suppress this disease but are
not highly effective.
