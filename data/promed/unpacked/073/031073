Outbreak of cholera takes the lives of 2 victims in Mayabeque [province]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Two deaths from dehydration occurred from a suspected cholera outbreak affecting the municipality of Bataban√≥.

According to information provided by a nurse at the local Primary Care System, who requested anonymity for fear of losing her job, the deceased were a woman aged 66 and a man aged 71. In the case of the woman, highlighted the nurse, a neighbor knew she had diarrhea more than 15 times and advised the polyclinic. However, her condition was very weak and hours later on the evening of 19 Jun 2016, she died. The 2nd death occurred the next day. The investigation discovered the victim in agony, and medical services were not able to revitalize him.

The nurse says the municipality health authorities asked physicians maintain discretion in the matter. In the latest report of the local system, made on 22 Jun 2016, 11 cases were diagnosed with bacterial diarrhea.

A resident of Cobas Lopez said that in the morning of 21 Jun 2016, an investigation, house by house, had begun. A doctor (who asked not to be named) said that 3 more people have been diagnosed with cholera.
