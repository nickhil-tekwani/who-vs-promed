I agree fully with you in this matter. A few countries are reported not to
have any disease at all (which I seriously doubt). An honest country which
reports everything, on the other hand, tend to face all kinds of
difficulties when it comes to exporting animals and animal products.
Transparency and honesty are badly needed in this globalization era.

[Look what happened to Richard Nixon when he tried to "stonewall". The
truth can never hurt. Why governments do not get this is beyond me. Ever
look closely at countries that refuse to import sheep with antibodies to a
bluetongue virus? That's a very nice way of establishing bargaining power,
but it is not a data-based perspective. I have received a few messages
criticizing my uncivilized tone, criticizing my mention of unproven reports
("unnecessarily stirs the pot"), and criticizing my uncouth mention of the
need for honesty by government officials. I'll admit that complete honesty
in government is a novel thought but I am willing to take the heat. Keep
it coming. I reserve the right to hit the "Delete" key. Thanks to Dr.
Idris for his insight and vision. - Mod.CHC
