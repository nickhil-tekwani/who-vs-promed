Analyses of dead animals from 3 farms in Moselle, located near Sarrebourg, revealed that the animals were infected with anthrax, said the Moselle prefecture in a statement.

The results were confirmed by the reference laboratory of the National Health Security Food Agency (ANSES), based in Maison-Alfort. The remaining animals are being treated with antibiotics.

Anthrax is caused by bacteria that come from the ground. It primarily affects animals but sometimes can infect humans.

The farms are located near the towns of Saint-Jean-de-Bassel and Fénétrange, Moselle. "To date, only 4 [?] are considered as having contaminated pastures," and "19 cattle have succumbed to the disease," said the prefecture. According to the prefecture: "There is no risk of contamination to the people," but it is still recommended to "stay away from any wild animals found dead and respect the enclosed paddocks."

[Moselle is part of the current region of Alsace-Champagne-Ardenne-Lorraine and is surrounded by the French departments of Meurthe-et-Moselle and Bas-Rhin, as well as Germany (states of Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate) and Luxembourg in the north. Parts of Moselle belong to Parc naturel régional de Lorraine. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moselle_(department) and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorraine.

The account is brief, and it is not clear whether these were adjoining or separate farms, probably both. Anthrax would appear to have been a problem here in the past such that there were "champs maudits" (contaminated pastures). Speculatively, one of these sites accumulated enough spores to infect a grazing cow or 2, and, no longer sensitive to the risk of anthrax, the farmer's response was slow, and a couple more were affected; these provided enough contaminated haematophagic flies to carry the infection to animals in, to date, 2 other herds.

I hope that in 2 weeks' time, the survivors in the 3 herds are vaccinated. In the meantime, all adjoining herds should be vaccinated. It would be wise to check for affected deer and hogs in the Lorraine park, and collect up their carcasses for burning. The farmers and their veterinarians need to be on the alert and on watch for sick and unexpected deaths, as there will be more.

With 2 unexpected reappearances of bovine anthrax in France, this is a red flag for other regions to be on the alert and informed. - Mod.MHJ
