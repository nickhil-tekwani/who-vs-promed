Federal officials have concluded the investigation of a previously unrevealed multi-state foodborne illness outbreak. Ground beef was identified as the likely source of the _E. coli_ O157:H7 behind the infections. The only details provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture were the name of the pathogen and the suspected source. The outbreak is listed as not being active, but the posting does not list any outcomes.

This afternoon [30 Mar 2021] a spokeswoman from the CDC told Food Safety News that the ground-beef-related outbreak appears to be over. She said additional details were not immediately available.

As of this afternoon [30 Mar 2021] the CDC had not posted any information on the outbreak.

[No additional information has been supplied regarding this outbreak.

Ground beef is the classical vehicle for the transmission of enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ and the original one as reported in 1983:

Riley LW, Remis RS, Helgerson SD, et al.: Hemorrhagic colitis associated with a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype. N Engl J Med. 1983; 308(12): 681-5; https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198303243081203.

"Abstract
--------
We investigated 2 outbreaks of an unusual gastrointestinal illness that affected at least 47 people in Oregon and Michigan in February through March and May through June 1982. The illness was characterized by severe crampy abdominal pain, initially watery diarrhea followed by grossly bloody diarrhea, and little or no fever. It was associated with eating at restaurants belonging to the same fast-food restaurant chain in Oregon (P less than 0.005) and Michigan (P = 0.0005) and with eating any of 3 sandwiches containing 3 ingredients in common (beef patty, rehydrated onions, and pickles). Stool cultures did not yield previously recognized pathogens. However, a rare _Escherichia coli_ serotype, O157:H7, that was not invasive or toxigenic by standard tests was isolated from 9 of 12 stools collected within 4 days of onset of illness in both outbreaks combined, and from a beef patty from a suspected lot of meat in Michigan. The only known previous isolation of this serotype was from a sporadic case of hemorrhagic colitis in 1975. This report describes a clinically distinctive gastrointestinal illness associated with _E. coli_ O157:H7, apparently transmitted by undercooked meat."
