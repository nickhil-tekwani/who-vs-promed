An outbreak of swine fever at a Romanian farm belonging to the
world's largest pork processor has killed 20 000 pigs, officials said
Saturday [4 Aug 2007].

Swine fever is a viral disease that is fatal to pigs but has no known
effect on people.

The sickened swine were found at a farm in the southwestern village
of Cenei, 20 km (12 miles) southeast of Timisoara, said Ioan Jeleriu,
who heads the Veterinary Heath Authority in Timis county, home to
many of Romania's pig farms.

The farm belongs to Smithfield Foods Inc., based in Smithfield,
Virginia, he said. The company has 25 pig farms in Timis and others
in western Romania, Jeleriu said.

Authorities have shut down other farms in the region until
inspections of their pigs are carried out.

"All the farms are blocked; no pigs are going in or coming out until
we determine the health status of every farm," Jeleriu said. "We have
to see where this virus came from; maybe it came from wild boar. It
could have come from anywhere."

He said the dead pigs would be buried under a layer of clay, rocks
and disinfectant to stop the virus from spreading.

The last outbreak of swine fever in the Timis area was in 2003,
authorities said.

Smithfield is the largest pork producer in western Romania with an
investment of Euro 800 million [USD 1.1 billion], news agency
Mediafax reported. The company bought Communist-era state-owned pig farms.

Opposition lawmaker Ilie Sarbu, a former agriculture minister,
accused authorities of trying to cover up the disease by saying that
pigs had died in a recent heat wave.

Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union on 1 Jan 2007 amid
concerns over animal health and food safety standards. The EU told
both countries they would have to eradicate swine fever before they
could sell pork in the rest of the EU without restrictions.
