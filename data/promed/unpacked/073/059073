Close on the heels of an outbreak of gastroenteritis in Sirsa town, dengue
fever has made an appearance. About half a dozen cases of dengue fever have
so far been reported from various private nursing homes.
According to reports, a doctor with one of the private nursing homes said
that the platelet count of his patient had gone too low. He said that
diagnosis was confirmed when the patient started passing blood in the urine
and also haemmorhages were noticed under the skin.

[Fever, low platelets counts, blood in urine, hemorrhaging elsewhere. Sure
sounds like it could be dengue but laboratory confirmation always is
appropriate and necessary for confirmation. I wonder whether "nursing
home" indicates elderly residents only. That might make the diagnosis
questionable. Adequate laboratory confirmation will clarify this
diagnosis. - Mod.CHC]
