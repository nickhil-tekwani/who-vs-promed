[The number of cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia is now 808 including 346 deaths (case fatality rate 42.8 percent). The newly reported recovered case is most likely the 49-year-old expat male in Jeddah confirmed as having MERS-CoV infection on 7 Nov 2014, who at the time of report was noted to be in critical condition. At that time a history of possible animal exposure was under investigation.

[With today's newly confirmed case in Alkharj it brings the total number of cases reported in Alkharj in the past 10 days (since 11 Nov 2014) to 4, with 3 cases having been reported in the past 3 days. Of the cases reported in Alkharj this month (November 2014), one was under investigation for possible animal as well as healthcare associated contacts, one was under investigation for possible contact with suspected or confirmed cases in both the healthcare environment and the community, one had a definite history of animal exposure, and one had a history of contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the community. It appears as though there may be a chain of transmission ongoing in Alkharj. More information on investigations ongoing in Alkharj would be greatly appreciated.

Today's newly reported death is most likely the 79-year-old female in Taif reported as a confirmed case on 12 Nov 2014 at which time she was noted to be in critical condition. History of possible exposures (animal contact, contact with suspected or confirmed cases in the healthcare environment or community) was under investigation at the time of the report of confirmation.

[The fatalities reported on this date (19 Nov 2014) involve 2 elderly patients from Alkharj. One, an 84-year-old Saudi female who had been reported as a confirmed case on 18 Nov 2014, and a 99-year-old Saudi male who was reported as a confirmed case on 19 Nov 2014, the same date as the report of confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. The 84-year-old female was under investigation for possible contact with a suspected or confirmed case in both the healthcare environment and the community, whereas the 99-year-old male was noted to have had animal exposure.

The newly reported recovered case is most likely the 45-year-old expat female in Riyadh who was reported as confirmed on 10 Nov 2014 at which time she was noted to be in stable condition. At that time, a history of possible contact with a suspected or confirmed case in the community was under investigation.

Saudi Arabia tackles MERS virus, still hunting source
-----------------------------------------------------
Saudi Arabia has not yet traced the source of a mysterious camel virus, leaving many questions about a disease that has killed 346 people in the Kingdom.

The lack of scientific evidence about how camels contract the virus, which causes an often fatal illness called Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in people, echoes wider concerns about the threat posed to human health by animal-borne pathogens, including the Ebola virus.

There is no cure or vaccine for MERS -- a severe respiratory disease which causes cough, fever, breathing problems and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure.

Yet studies of both camels and people infected with MERS in Saudi Arabia have given preliminary results that are helping authorities curb the disease's spread, according to the scientist overseeing the work.

"Coming into close contact with the nasal secretions of camels is a major risk factor," said Tariq Madani, head of the scientific advisory board of the Saudi health ministry command and control center (CCC) set up in June [2014] to handle the outbreak.

"The main transmission is actually human to human," he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

MERS was 1st identified in humans in 2012 and is caused by a coronavirus from the same viral family as the one that caused a deadly outbreak of SARS in China in 2003. Some 808 people in Saudi Arabia are known to have been infected with it since it was discovered, and 346 of them have died.

Madani said analysis showed most people were infected in hospitals.

"We found out that 97 percent of the cases were healthcare associated," he said. "And 3 percent of them were primary cases who probably acquired the infection from contact with camels."

Tighter infection controls in hospitals have contributed to a significant drop in cases recently, but he warned sporadic primary cases will still pop up.

Tests of nasal and rectal swabs from camel imports arriving from the Horn of Africa -- the source of the majority of camels traded and farmed in Saudi -- found no traces of the MERS virus, Madani said, with 71 animals tested so far.

"Until now the camels we have examined have proven to be negative -- and this is really very unexpected," he said.

Asked whether this suggested the camels were being infected within Saudi Arabia's borders, Madani said it was too early to reach conclusions, but said tests on imported camels will continue alongside studies of wild animals such as bats and monkeys that may also be harboring the virus.

Meanwhile, studies of 12 camels with which MERS patients had had contact showed 6 had the virus circulating [?] in their noses, but tests of their milk and urine were virus-free -- suggesting the risk to humans from drinking camel milk is far lower than from direct contact with nasal secretions.

Another study found that among a group of 36 workers in a camel slaughterhouse, 58 percent had MERS antibodies -- indicating they had been infected with it at some point.

"None of them recalls having a severe infection or pneumonia," Madani said. "And this indicates that you get some sort of immunity as a result of repeated exposure to camels and the virus."

[The above media report is reminder of the state of knowledge on MERS-CoV transmission. It has been apparent that there has been extensive nosocomial transmission, although exact risk factors for transmission within the healthcare environment have not as yet been fully determined. Transmission in renal dialysis units seemed to be significant in Alhasa in 2013, and in Taif this year (2014). Also, while the emergency room was identified as an area for transmission, no mention has been made of possible high risk exposures that occurred in the emergency room -- was there a MERS-CoV infected individual who was treated with a nebulizer such as was seen with SARS-CoV transmission in 2003? Many questions remain. Results of case control studies if performed would be greatly appreciated.

While the body of evidence on MERS-CoV infection of camels has been mounting, how and where the virus is introduced into the camel population remains an enigma. And, while the MERS-CoV is closely related to a bat beta coronavirus, what if any role do bats play in the MERS-CoV transmission cycle? - Mod.MPP]

[In July 2014, the OIE convened a scientific expert ad hoc Group meeting on MERS-CoV infection in animals in Paris, in order to summarize the latest scientific data available and to provide guidance and recommendations to prevent and control the disease at the human-animal interface. Public health and animal health experts from different countries joined the meeting. The experts identified areas of priority for research studies in animals and collection of scientific data which will assist the development of appropriate animal health management measures and, when relevant, limit potential for further human infections. The Group concluded that MERS-CoV in camels did not meet the criteria to figure in the OIE listed diseases. Since MERS-CoV is a serious public health concern with zoonotic potential, infection in animals must be reported to the OIE as an emerging disease. Such reports have so far been submitted from several countries in the Arab peninsula (excluding Saudi Arabia) and from Iran. A request for information from Pakistan is pending. Following the meeting, the OIE Q&A on MERS-CoV was updated reflecting the latest scientific knowledge. The recent version is accessible at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/update-august-2014-questions-answers-on-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov/. MERS-CoV in animals was addressed during the recent IMED-2014 meeting in Vienna. - Mod.AS]
