Dog influenza case confirmed in Augusta County (Virgina)
--------------------------------------------------------
With the H1N1 influenza strain grabbing the headlines across the
nation, it may be easy to overlook Bowser coughing in the corner. But
now, pet owners should be on the alert for flu symptoms in their
canine companions.


A relatively new contagious respiratory disease of dogs, caused by a
Type-A influenza virus identified as H3N8, has been discovered in a
dog at the Cedar Crest animal clinic in Augusta County, Virginia.

According to William Olkowski, a board-certified canine/feline
specialist in Augusta County, this is the 1st case of the virus in
the county. In the last 10 months there have been 6 other cases
confirmed in Virginia -- before that there had been none reported.

"The concern for dog owners, as well as veterinarians, is that this
canine influenza viral infection can't be easily differentiated from
other more common respiratory ailments," Olkowski said. Dogs come in
coughing and sneezing, he said, and we can't tell by looking at them
if they have the virus. The signs are the same as a cold or the
common kennel cough.

[Canine influenza is a type A orthomyxovirus. It mimics "kennel
cough" or _Bordetella brochiseptica_/parainfluenza virus complex,
which sounds like a hacking cough that does not seem to stop. The
cough with canine influenza can be either moist or dry and about 20
percent of infected dogs may show little or no clinical signs but
still be shedding virus. Canine influenza is contagious by
aerosolized droplets and contaminated fomites (inanimate objects)
that the dog can contact. People can transmit the disease to their pets.

Unfortunately, treatment is non-specific but generally supportive. It
is important to get treatment early to reduce the death rate.
