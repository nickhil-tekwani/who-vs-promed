USDA announces BSE test results and new BSE confirmatory testing
protocol, Washington DC, 24 Jun 2005
-----------------------------------------------
Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns today [24 Jun 2005] announced that
the U.S. Department of Agriculture has received final test results
from The Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, England,
confirming that a sample from an animal that was blocked from the
food supply in November 2004 has tested positive for bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). Johanns also directed USDA
scientists to work with international experts to thoughtfully develop
a new protocol that includes performing dual confirmatory tests in
the event of another "inconclusive" BSE screening test.

"We are currently testing nearly 1000 animals per day as part of our
BSE enhanced surveillance program, more than 388 000 total tests, and
this is the 1st confirmed case resulting from our surveillance,"
Johanns said. "I am encouraged that our interlocking safeguards are
working exactly as intended. This animal was blocked from entering
the food supply because of the firewalls we have in place. Americans
have every reason to continue to be confident in the safety of our
beef."

Effective immediately, if another BSE rapid screening test results in
inconclusive findings, USDA will run both an IHC and Western blot
confirmatory test. If results from either confirmatory test are
positive, the sample will be considered positive for BSE.

"I want to make sure we continue to give consumers every reason to be
confident in the health of our cattle herd," Johanns said. "By adding
the 2nd confirmatory test, we boost that confidence and bring our
testing in line with the evolving worldwide trend to use both IHC and
Western blot together as confirmatory tests for BSE." USDA has
initiated an epidemiological investigation to determine the animal's
herd of origin. That investigation is not yet complete. The animal
was born before the United States instituted a ruminant-to-ruminant
feed ban in August 1997, which prevents the use of most mammalian
protein in cattle feed. According to internationally accepted
research, feed containing meat-and-bone meal is the primary way BSE
is transferred to the cattle population.

The animal was selected for testing because, as a non-ambulatory
animal, it was considered to be at higher risk for BSE. An initial
screening test on the animal in November 2004 was inconclusive,
triggering USDA to conduct the internationally accepted confirmatory
IHC tests. Those test results were negative. Earlier this month [June
2005], USDA's Office of the Inspector General recommended further
testing of the 7-month-old sample using another internationally
recognized confirmatory test, the Western blot. Unlike the IHC, the
Western blot was reactive, prompting USDA to send samples from the
animal to the Weybridge laboratory for further analysis.

The laboratory in Weybridge, England, is recognized by the World
Animal Health Organization, or OIE, as a world reference laboratory
for BSE. Weybridge officials this week [4th week June 2005] conducted
a combination of rapid, IHC and Western blot testing on tissue
samples from the animal in question. At the same time these
diagnostic tests were being run by Weybridge, USDA conducted its own
additional tests.

As a non-ambulatory -- or "downer" -- animal, the cow was prohibited
from entering the human food supply under an interim final rule in
effect since January 2004. Research has shown that BSE is most likely
to be found in older non-ambulatory cattle, animals showing signs of
central nervous system disorders, injured or emaciated animals, and
cattle that have died for unexplained reasons. USDA's testing program
targets these groups of animals for testing.

The system of human health protections includes the USDA ban on
specified risk materials, or SRM's, from the food supply. SRM's are
most likely to contain the BSE agent if it is present in an animal.
Additional measures, such as a long standing ban on importing cattle
and beef products from high-risk countries, a ruminant-to-ruminant
feed ban, U.S. slaughter practices, and aggressive surveillance
provide a series of interlocking safeguards to protect U.S. consumers
and animal health.

USDA remains committed to protecting both U.S. consumers and U.S.
livestock from BSE, and, to that end, continues efforts to detect the
disease through its enhanced BSE surveillance program. Once
sufficient data from the surveillance program has been accumulated,
USDA will consult with outside experts to analyze that data and
determine whether any changes to existing risk management measures
are necessary.

This confirmed case of BSE in no way impacts the safety of our
nation's food supply. As the epidemiological investigation
progresses, USDA will continue to communicate findings in a timely
and transparent manner.

US finds 2nd mad cow, industry defends safeguards
-----------------------------------------------
[There is a lot of repetition in all of these articles, but the
following points are pertinent. - Mod.MHJ]

Ron DeHaven, head of the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection,
said the infected animal was slaughtered at a pet food plant [a
renderer]. Neither official [DeHaven and U.S. Agriculture Secretary
Mike Johanns] would identify the state where the cow came from.
Published reports have said it was sent to slaughter last November
2004 in Texas, the nation's biggest cattle state.

Officials said the infected animal was born before a 1997 ban on
recycling cattle remains into cattle rations. There was no evidence
the infected animal was imported, said the USDA, which was doing DNA
testing to confirm its herd of origin.

USDA officials said the new BSE case was a different strain from the
1st U.S. case and the outbreak that occurred in Britain in the 1980s.
Some experts had speculated the conflicting test results were due to
an unusual type of BSE. [It has been likened to a European strain of
BSE. - Mod.MHJ]

Canada says no surprise U.S. finds mad cow case
-----------------------------------------------
Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin said on Friday [24 Jun 2005] that
it was no surprise the United States had discovered a case of mad cow
disease, or BSE, and urged Washington to reopen the border to
Canadian cattle shipments. "That border should have been opened a
long time ago, based on very sound science," Martin told reporters in
High River, Alberta. "The Canadian means of determining BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy), of controlling BSE, is among the world's
best. That there is a case in the U.S. is not a surprise.
And...hopefully -- judges and court decisions and injunctions to the
contrary -- the view of (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) and the
U.S. administration should prevail. That border should be open and it
should be open now."

Canada has reported 3 cases of mad cow disease since May 2003.
Another cow with the disease was found in Washington state in
December 2003 and was born in Canada. The United States closed its
border to Canadian cattle when the 1st case was discovered in Alberta
2 years ago. The U.S. agriculture department has tried to open up the
border to young cattle from Canada, but has been stopped by an
injunction granted by a federal judge in Montana.

[In light of these events, it is worth rereading "BSE policy - USA:
change considered, 20050418.1094" and related posts. This is the 1st
autocthonous US BSE diagnosis in some 388 000 samples tested. What
the true risk is is a matter of some heated debate, unfortunately. -
