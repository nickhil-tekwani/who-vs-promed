ProMED has heard from a usually reliable source that there is an outbreak of
yellow fever in Guinea, West Africa. YF has not been reported from that
country since 2003 � see refs. below, but was to be expected, since
neighboring Liberia & Mali have reported YF outbreaks during 2004 � see
refs. below.
Please send any reports you find on the current outbreak to
<promed@promedmail.org>.
