Government Probes Spread of Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever
---------------------------------------------------
KAMPALA: The Ministry of Health has instituted an investigation into the
spread of Ebola hemorrhagic fever among health workers in Gulu and Masindi
as the death toll among such workers rose to 15. The Assistant Commissioner
for National Disease Control, Dr. Alex Opio, said the investigation would
also cover the persistence of the disease in the 2 districts.
Briefing the press at the Ministry headquarters in Wandegeya yesterday [8
Dec 2000, Opio said some of the fallen health workers were not working in
the Ebola wards. A total of 26 health workers have contracted the virus in
Gulu and Masindi, according to the Health Ministry records. Of these cases,
15 have died (12 nurses, a doctor, a medical assistant and an ambulance
driver), 4 have been discharged, while 7 are still undergoing treatment, 3
in Masindi and 4 in Gulu.
The overall death toll has risen to 160, after 2 patients in Gulu and 2 in
Masindi died since Tue 5 Dec 2000. In total 7 new cases in Gulu and none in
Masindi have been confirmed since Tuesday, raising the overall number of
people who have suffered from Ebola fever to 406.
Opio said blood samples from suspected Ebola patients in Jinja had been
submitted to Gulu for testing. He said they were unlikely to be [confirmed
as Ebola fever.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health has rushed in to calm Masindi residents
who were threatening the Masindi LC5 [? and Ebola Task Force Chairman,
John Majara, with death. The residents accuse Majara of importing Ebola
fever by transporting patients from the outbreak area in Kaduku, Kigumba
sub-county, to Masindi Hospital over 50 kilometres away, [bypassing
Kiryandongo hospital near Kaduku. However, Opio said Majara was not solely
responsible for the decision.
Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is
flying to Atlanta a piece of skin [taken from a man suspected to have died
of Ebola fever in Rwanda. The facilities in the CDC mobile laboratory in
Gulu can only test blood samples.
