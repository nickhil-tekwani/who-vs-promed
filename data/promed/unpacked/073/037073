WHO Dismisses Reports of Hemorrhagic Fever Epidemic
---------------------------------------------------
Calling media claims of an outbreak of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever in
Afghanistan and Pakistan "incorrect and misleading," the World Health
Organisation stated on Friday that the large presence of international
media looking for stories in the region has contributed to exaggerated
reports of an epidemic. The WHO also dismissed rumors that the disease was
being spread as biological warfare.
According to the WHO, only 35 cases of the virus have been reported in the
Pakistani-Afghan frontier region and only 4 people are currently being
treated. "Nothing suggests it will get worse," said Ian Simpson of the WHO
Center for Communicable Diseases.
Simpson also addressed the alleged similarities to the deadly Ebola virus.
"It doesn't spread as quickly, and there is a significantly higher recovery
rate," he said, adding that with winter rapidly approaching in the region,
the number of new cases [of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is likely to
decline as the ticks that are responsible for its spread will be wiped out.
Last week (UN Wire, 5 Oct 2001), the WHO, together with Pakistani health
authorities, stated that it would start investigating a reported outbreak
of hemorrhagic fever near the Pakistani city of Quetta.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus and Ebola virus are unrelated
viruses. The only common feature is their association with hemorrhagic
fever. CCHF virus is a member of the _Bunyaviridae_ family of viruses and
is tick-transmitted, whereas Ebola virus is a member of the family
_Filoviridae_ and spreads from person-to-person without apparent
involvement of a vector. CCHF virus is endemic in many parts of Asia and
elsewhere, whereas Ebola virus has only appeared sporadically in Africa and
among monkeys imported into the USA from southeast Asia. Only the African
isolates of Ebola virus have been associated with human disease. - Mod.CP
