3rd hospital is hit by new strain of superbug
---------------------------------------------
A 3rd hospital in Britain has been struck by the virulent new strain of the
bug _Clostridium difficile_, a sign that the lethal infection may be
spreading out of control.

Oldchurch Hospital in Romford, Essex, confirmed on 24 Jun 2005, that 10
patients had contracted the infection and one had died. A spokeswoman for
the Barking, Havering and Redbridge Trust said: "We have found this
infection because we have gone looking for it. Our surgeons noticed when
patients got _C. difficile_, they were substantially sicker than normal. We
sent specimens for analysis and found they had the type O27 strain."

The hospital is the 3rd to be infected by the lethal type O27 strain since
The Independent revealed on 6 Jun 2005 that the bug had caused 12 deaths
and infected 300 patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Buckinghamshire
since 2003.

On Wed 22 Jun 2005, the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust said it
had been stricken by the Type O27 strain, and cases of _C. difficile_
infection are running at twice normal levels.
