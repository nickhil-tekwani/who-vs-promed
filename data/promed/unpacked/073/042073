Highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1 HPAI) spread in the Middle East: risk assessment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
This risk assessment provides an estimate of the likelihood of introduction of H5N1 HPAI from recently infected countries (Lebanon and Iraq) to other countries in the Middle East region and neighbouring territories as a result of the movement of live poultry (both legal and illegal), poultry-related products and the migration of wild birds.

The preliminary assessment based on the available information and uncertainties associated indicate that the risk of introduction of H5N1 HPAI for each of the 9 regional and neighbouring countries or territories varies and is as follows:
1. High: Iran (Islamic Republic of), Israel, Jordan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey,
2. Medium: Gaza Strip, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and The West Bank,
3. Low: Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia,
4. Negligible: Cyprus.

The situation in the region is of concern given the existing poultry populations at risk and the potential for spread between countries. Given the presence of civil unrest and active civil war in some countries of the region, investment in agriculture and livestock is reduced, including limitations to public veterinary services. Underreporting of animal disease events is a significant challenge given the lack of reporting systems in those areas with ongoing conflict. It is therefore possible that, in addition to Iraq and Lebanon, the disease is already present in the Syrian Arab Republic. The cause of the recent incursions into the region is currently unknown but a combination of wild birds seeding infection and trade with neighbouring countries is likely. Poultry and poultry-related trade and movements play an important role in national and cross-border spread. The overall risk for the region in terms of potential spread to uninfected countries ranges from negligible to high depending on the country with Iran (Islamic Republic of), Israel, Jordan, the Syrian Arab Republic and Turkey being at highest risk of incursion.

The current H5N1 HPAI epizootic is expected to have a potential impact on food security, human health and poultry-dependent livelihoods in a region which is already suffering from political unrest and deteriorated public and animal health services.

"Conclusions
------------
Since H5N1 HPAI is a zoonotic virus and therefore constitutes a public health threat, communication among ministries and enhanced surveillance are as important as prompt reporting. The regional risk map [see Fig 5 in the full document, source URL] based on risk factors such as extensive and intensive poultry density, lakes, rivers, estuaries and wetlands highlighted differences in HPAI risk within and between countries in the region.

Areas within Israel, Lebanon, The West Bank and Gaza Strip, and western and northern parts of the Syrian Arab Republic are at high risk for H5N1 HPAI presence if the disease is introduced (i.e. greater than 80 percent).

Areas with lower to medium risk probabilities were distributed across Azerbaijan, Georgia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Risk probabilities were driven primarily by extensive poultry density (greater than 80 percent) rather than the presence of lakes or wetlands (0 percent).

In conclusion, based on both the risk assessment and the risk factor analyses, countries at high risk include Turkey and the Syrian Arab Republic (particularly areas near the Kurdistan region and the western area near the border with Lebanon) and Iran (Islamic Republic of). Given the presence of high poultry production areas and low biosecurity along the Syrian Arab Republic border with Iraq and no information on the HPAI situation in the Syrian Arab Republic due to non-functional veterinary infrastructure, it is likely that H5N1 HPAI virus has already been introduced in poultry populations there, though they have not been reported to date. Iran (Islamic Republic of) is at similar risk judging from anecdotal evidence of informal trade at the Kurdish border with Iran (Islamic Republic of), but unlike the Syrian Arab Republic, the veterinary systems for detection and response are operational. Jordan shares borders with the Syrian Arab Republic and Iraq, and the movement of livestock, including live poultry across borders from the Syrian Arab Republic, is ongoing and is associated with refugee movements.

Countries at medium risk of incursion of H5N1 HPAI include Gaza Strip, Israel, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the West Bank. For Gaza Strip, Israel and the West Bank, there is no evidence of substantive trade, either legal or illegal from the affected countries. Additionally, incursions may be mitigated by high security concerns implemented at borders. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia share borders with Iraq and given that the extent of spread in Iraq is not fully discerned, movement of infected live poultry is possible.

Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia are located along spring migration pathways for wild birds travelling northwards but the risk of wild birds becoming infected and subsequently seeding viruses to these countries is considered low. The role of live poultry trade is considered low to negligible. The overall risk of introduction of H5N1 into the poultry population is low.

Cyprus is considered at negligible risk of incursion from the 2 infected countries given its geographic location (separated by sea), lack of poultry trade and the fact that it is not on the wild bird migratory route.

There is a high uncertainty on the reliability of available data related to trade, poultry value/marketing chains, poultry production systems, interactions between wild birds and poultry production systems, and local wild water bird species distribution patterns." - Mod.AS
