A 22-year-old pregnant woman in Hubei Province dies of highly
pathogenic avian influenza
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On Fri 4 Jun 2010, China's Ministry of Health reported a human case
of highly pathogenic avian influenza [H5N1 virus infection] in Hubei
Province. The victim was 22 years old, female, 4 months pregnant, and
was an unemployed resident of Echeng District of Ezhou City in Hubei
Province. She fell ill on 23 May 2010 and was hospitalized for
treatment as her conditioned deteriorated. She died on Thu 3 Jun 2010
at 12:35 a.m. despite an intensive effort to save her.

On the night of Wed 2 Jun 2010, the Hubei Province Center for Disease
Control ran tests on samples from the patient's respiratory tract,
which were positive for H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
infection. Virus isolation work is now underway.

Epidemiological investigation by local health agencies found that the
patient had contact with sick and dead poultry prior to falling ill.
Work teams and specialist teams sent by China's Ministry of
Agriculture will launch investigations and laboratory tests on
poultry, in conjunction with Hubei veterinary agencies. No outbreaks
of avian influenza in poultry have been found so far.

[According to the World Health Organisation this fatality would be
the 1st case of human H5N1 avian influenza virus infection recorded
in China in the current year (2010). Overall there have been now 39
cases in China, 26 of whom have been fatal (see
<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2010_05_06/en/index.html>).
In fact Dan Silver has calculated that 485 days have passed since the
most recent previous human case of avian influenza was reported in
China.
