YELLOW FEVER VACCINE SHORTAGE - INDIA

Hospitals across India are turning away people who require a yellow fever
vaccine to travel to countries in South America and Africa that are endemic
for this communicable viral affliction.
Such is the short supply that travellers are being asked to report to the
airport with a visa stamped passport to get their vaccine. If they are
denied it even at the airport, the other option is to get it at the
destination. [Bad option; vaccine takes 10 days to produce full immunity
(see below). - Mod.JW]
Members of a delegation travelling with President APJ Abdul Kalam to South
Africa and Tanzania in September were refused vaccination at the first
instance. However, the government-run Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in New
Delhi agreed to give the shot only after ascertaining that the vaccine
seeker was travelling with the president. Despite a prior appointment,
members were refused the vaccine at the hospital until the staff confirmed
that the seekers were in the presidential delegation.
"There has been a shortage in the country for months -- we have written to
the health ministry but no fresh supply of the yellow fever vaccine has
arrived in India," complained Nilamani Sarmah, the senior chief medical
officer of the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital.
Yellow fever, an infectious tropical disease caused by a virus transmitted
by mosquitoes, causes high fever, jaundice and often gastrointestinal
haemorrhaging that could be fatal if not treated. The World Health
Organisation (WHO) has stipulated mandatory vaccination for travellers to
34 African and South American countries. The international yellow fever
vaccination certificate is valid 10 days after vaccination and remains
valid for 10 years.
The shortage of the yellow fever vaccine has also been reported from
Mumbai, India's commercial capital from where thousands travel to Africa
and South America. According to doctors in New Delhi, an average of 200
applicants seek the yellow fever vaccine in any given month. Lately,
however, most people have had to cancel or put off their trip because of
the shortage.
In the past several weeks, travellers have been encouraged to get their
vaccine only from the airport of their destination, which, doctors say, is
a problem since the vaccine takes 10 days to take effect. "If your trip is
shorter than that, you will be quarantined when you [return to] India,"
said Sarmah. The vaccine is produced in the USA, Britain, Senegal, Russia &
Brazil.

[Up to Wed 23 Jun 2004, the Ministries of Health of Colombia, Peru, Brazil
& Bolivia had reported to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) the
occurrence of 86 confirmed cases of jungle yellow fever, with 41 deaths; see
<http://www.paho.org/English/AD/DPC/CD/eid-eer-24-jun-2004.htm#jyf>.
Since then there has been a report of a case in Venezuela. In Africa, YF
has been reported this year in Burkina Faso, Liberia, and most recently,
Mauritania. Although all these cases originated in rural areas, some of
them made their way to city hospitals where they could have sparked urban
epidemics and infected foreign visitors.
Readers will remember that when polio vaccination was stopped in northern
Nigeria a few months ago, cases of polio appeared there and originated
cases in other African countries, costing their health services millions of
dollars on top of the tragedy of avoidable paralysis and death (see ProMED
post Poliomyelitis - Africa: Guinea, Mali 20040824.2362). Since commerce
must go on, and business people must travel, this shortage in India is
likely to have led to a thriving black market in false YF vaccination
certificates, as was the case some years ago in Pakistan (see ProMED post
Yellow fever threat to Asia 19990311.0370).
Remembering the fatal cases of YF in unvaccinated tourists visiting the
Amazon and Africa -- see refs. below -- it is not hard to imagine the
tragedy in human lives, not to mention the economic cost, if an
unvaccinated traveler were to become infected with YF, return to a major
city in India and set off an epidemic which could sweep Asia. The vector
mosquito is everywhere. It is to be hoped that the international agencies,
YF vaccine producers, and India's neighboring countries will work fast to
resolve this crisis. - Mod.JW]
