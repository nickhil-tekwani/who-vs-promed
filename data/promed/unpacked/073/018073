1st Serotine Bat from Southern England Found To Be EBLV-1-antibody Positive
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A 3-year prevalence study of European Bat Lyssaviruses (EBLV), or bat
rabies, in the United Kingdom (UK) bat population undertaken by the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency has identified one (of 51 examined)
serotine bat (_Eptesicus serotinus_) from southern England to be
antibody positive for EBLV-1 (1). This EBLV-1 strain is the
predominant type in bats throughout continental Europe, especially in
serotine bats. Previously in the UK, only Daubenton's bats (_Myotis
daubentonii_) have been found to be positive for EBLV, and only for
the rarer type EBLV-2 (2-4). The presence of EBLV-2 antibodies, but
not the virus, in Daubenton bats has previously been estimated at
between 6 and 15 percent in the UK bat population. Just over 4
percent of the Daubenton's bats were antibody positive in this recent
study. The presence of EBLV-2 virus have been detected previously in
4 (of 113 examined) Daubenton's bats in the UK. The Pipistrelle bat
(_Pipistrellus pipistrellus_), the most common bat in the UK, has not
been found to carry EBLV in the UK.
The risk to the general public from EBLV remains low. Only volunteer
or licensed bat handlers will routinely come into contact with bats.
This new finding increases the very limited understanding of EBLVs in
bats, and surveillance in bats should be continued. The presence of
antibodies and not virus may indicate that the bats were not
infectious. The natural history of EBLV infection in bats may include
full recovery with sterilizing immunity.
These findings do not change the previous public health advice.
Clinicians do, however, need to be aware of the risk of rabies after
significant exposure to bats. If a person is bitten, scratched, or
there is direct contact with a bat to mucosa or broken skin, the area
should be cleaned thoroughly with water and soap and medical advice
should be sought urgently and expert assessment performed.
Post-exposure prophylaxis (vaccination and possibly administration of
immunoglobulins) is recommended.
Any member of the public finding a bat behaving abnormally, found in an
unusual place, or under unusual circumstances, should not attempt to handle or
move the animal, but contact their local bat conservation group or the Bat
Conservation Trust (details can be found on the Trust's website at
<http://www.bats.org.uk/>).
All bat handlers and other people likely to be at risk of exposure
through the close handling of bats should be vaccinated against
rabies, and this is provided free of charge by the Health Protection
Agency through the NHS. The awareness in the general public and
health care professionals of this small risk needs to be addressed
without creating unnecessary fear of these endangered and protected
animals.

[This report records 3 significant observations: The 1st detection of
EBLV-1 infection in the UK; the 1st detection of EBLV of any serotype
in serotine bats in the UK (although EBLV-1 is relatively common in
serotine bats in mainland Europe); and the suggestion that EBLV
infection in bats may include full recovery with sterilizing
immunity. The bat in question may have been a migrant due to the fact
that it was captured in southern Britain. However, this is not
certain since the 1st (and only) fatal human case of bat rabies in
the UK, which was due to infection with the less common EBLV-2
serotype, occurred in central Scotland in 2004, and the virus may
have been carried by an indigenous bat. Clearly, further surveillance
of the bat population of the UK needs to be continued to assess the
prevalence of bat rabies and the degree of risk for the human
population. The suggestion that development of sterilizing immunity
in bats may occur following EBLV infection is intriguing and needs to
be investigated further. - Mod.CP]
