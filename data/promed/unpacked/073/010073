Germany: Virus Infection Closes US Army Bases in Hesse
---------------------------------------------------
A mysterious viral infection has forced military authorities in Germany to
close 4 bases, ordering nearly 4000 personnel and their dependents to stay
at home, authorities said on Fri 20 Feb 2004. The bases at Schwalmstadt,
Schwarzenborn, Stadtallendorf, and Neustadt will be closed for 3 weeks
while the premises are disinfected. "This is the worst single such
infectious situation we've ever had," a Defence Ministry spokesman.
The viral epidemic began in Schwalmstadt in the central German state of
Hessen, when 150 of the 800 personnel stationed there complained of
inflamed and itching eyes. The Bundeswehr closed that base last week. Just
4 days later, the same symptoms cropped up at nearby Neustadt, where all
800 service personnel were told to go home until further notice.
With some 14 000 troops stationed in Hesse, German military authorities
became alarmed as 2 more bases were ordered closed. "Something is being
transmitted between these bases -- food, laundry, books -- something that
people touch with their hands and then inadvertently transfer to their
eyes," a spokesman said.
At the one base in the area that is still open, in Frankenberg, the base
commander is confident the epidemic is waning. "We have had just a dozen
reported cases of eye infection out of a base population of 1200," said
Colonel Peter Richard, Frankenberg base commander. "We have launched
hygiene drills and cleaning campaigns aimed at ensuring that this does not
spread any further."
Bundeswehr medical officials note that infectious diseases are common at
military bases due to the close confines of 1000 or more men and women
living and working together. "This infection, however, is a definitely more
stubborn than any we have seen in recent years," one military doctor told
Deutsche Presse-Agentur dpa.

[A similar report in the Saturday edition of the Allgemeine Zeitung
(summarised by Matthew Bruns) indicated that, following an outbreak of
infection affecting about 230 soldiers in 6 barracks in northern and
southern Hessen, some 4700 members of the German Federal Armed Forces have
have been withdrawn from service. Disinfection of the 6 barracks is
estimated to require closure for a period of three weeks.

It is not clear whether the 2 incidents are connected, and the descriptions
of the illnesses are not sufficient to suggest a diagnosis. Outbreaks of
adenovirus infection are not uncommon in military establishments, and some
types of adenovirus infection have been associated with conjunctivitis in
the past. More specific information is awaited. - Mod.CP]
