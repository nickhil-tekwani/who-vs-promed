CHP closely monitors 4 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Mainland
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (23 Jan 2015) closely monitoring 4 additional human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) in the Mainland, and again urged the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel.

According to the notification of the Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong Province, the 2 cases involved a 68-year-old man in Shantou who was hospitalised for treatment in serious condition, and a 4-year-old boy in Zhaoqing who is in stable condition. According to the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning, the patient in Shanghai is a woman aged 75 who was under treatment in critical condition. In addition, according to the Health and Family Planning Commission of Yiwu Municipality, the patient in Yiwu, Zhejiang [Province], is a man aged 45 who was under isolation and treatment.

To date, 489 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities, respectively in Zhejiang (146 cases), Guangdong (127 cases), Jiangsu (63 cases), Shanghai (44 cases), Fujian (28 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (9 cases), Xinjiang (9 cases), Shandong (6 cases), Beijing (5 cases), Henan (4 cases), Guangxi (3 cases), Jilin (2 cases), Guizhou (1 case) and Hebei (1 case).

[The number of H7N9 cases increases daily in China. One must wonder, with this level of activity, how many mild cases are going unreported. It is likely, as with other viral infections, that the case number reported, 489, is a gross underestimate of the true disease burden. See: Yu H, Cowling BJ, Feng L, et al. Human infection with avian influenza A H7N9 virus: an assessment of clinical severity. Lancet. 2013 Jul 13;382(9887):138-45, which attempts to make such an estimate. - Mod.LK]

CHP investigates imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9)
---------------------------------------------------------------
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) is today (23 Jan 2015) investigating the 2nd imported human case of avian influenza A(H7N9) in Hong Kong this winter [2014-2015].

"Based on the seasonal pattern, it is likely that the activity of avian influenza viruses might further increase in winter and heightened vigilance is warranted. As the Serious Response Level under the Preparedness Plan for Influenza Pandemic remains activated, we again urge the public to maintain strict personal, food and environmental hygiene both locally and during travel," a spokesman for the CHP said.

Epidemiological investigations and control measures
---------------------------------------------------
The male patient, aged 79 with good past health, has presented with runny nose, sore throat and cough with sputum since 19 Jan 2015 and consulted a private doctor on the same day. He then attended the Accident and Emergency Department (AED) of Alice Ho Miu Ling Nethersole Hospital yesterday (22 Jan 2015) and was found febrile. He has been transferred to the Hospital Authority Infectious Disease Centre in Princess Margaret Hospital for further management and isolation and has been in stable condition all along.

His nasopharyngeal aspirate tested positive for avian influenza A(H7N9) upon preliminary laboratory testing by the CHP's Public Health Laboratory Services Branch.

Initial epidemiological investigations revealed that the patient had travelled to Zhangmutou, Dongguan, Guangdong, on 5 Jan 2015 on his own during which he had visited a wet market with live poultry stalls but with no direct contact with poultry. He returned to Hong Kong on 19 Jan 2015 via Lo Wu Control Point. Based on information available thus far, it is classified as an imported case. Investigations are ongoing.

Contact tracing conducted so far located 2 close contacts who accompanied the patient to the AED.

(A) Close contacts
Close contacts will be put under quarantine and prescribed with antiviral presumptive treatment until the completion of the 5-day treatment or 10 days after last exposure to the patient, whichever is earlier. They include the patient's son and a female family member who are asymptomatic.

(B) Other contacts
Tracing of other contacts, including relevant healthcare workers, ambulance officers, immigration officer and the doctor whom the patient consulted as well as relevant staff and clients, is underway. Other contacts will be put under medical surveillance.

The CHP is communicating with the relevant Mainland health authority to follow up the situation during the patient's stay in the Mainland.

Enhanced surveillance
---------------------
The CHP has enhanced surveillance of suspected cases in public and private hospitals, and activated electronic reporting system to monitor cases real-time with the Hospital Authority. Clinicians should pay special attention to patients with fever or influenza-like illness who visited wet market with live poultry or had contact with poultry in affected areas within the incubation period, that is 10 days before onset.

Letters to doctors, hospitals, kindergartens, child care centres, primary and secondary schools as well as residential care homes for the elderly and the disabled will be issued to alert them to the latest situation.

The case will be notified to the World Health Organization, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC), the health authorities of Guangdong and Macau, and the quarantine authority of Shenzhen.

To date, 506 cases have been reported by the Mainland health authorities since March 2013, including 489 cases in the Mainland and 17 cases exported to Hong Kong (12 cases), Taiwan (4 cases) and Malaysia (1 case).

Enhanced port health measures
-----------------------------
All boundary control points have implemented health surveillance measures. Thermal imaging systems are in place for body temperature checks of inbound travellers. Suspected cases will be immediately referred to public hospitals for follow-up. The DH's Port Health Office has enhanced body temperature checks by handheld devices. ... -- more
