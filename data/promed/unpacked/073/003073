Gardeners are being warned to wash their hands after using compost following a series of legionellosis cases in Scotland over the past 5 years. One man has died and 5 others have become ill after contracting a rare strain called _Legionella longbeachae_, which appears to come from compost. The unusual strain is well known in Australia and New Zealand, where bags of compost carry warning labels. But these are the 1st cases linked to compost to be confirmed in the UK.

As many gardeners head out to their gardens and allotments to enjoy the warm weather, experts are warning them to wash their hands after using compost, particularly before eating or smoking. "Gardening is a very healthy hobby but like anything in life there are a few risks," said Dr Martin Donaghy, medical director of Health Protection Scotland. "Over the past 5 years we've had 3 confirmed cases of [legionellosis due to] _Legionella longbeachae_, plus 2 'probable' and one 'possible' so we do need to take steps to reduce the risk even further."

Doctors all over the UK are being urged to be alert for a link with gardening if they see patients with unusual pneumonia. Symptoms of _L. longbeachae_ legionellosis include headaches, diarrhoea, or a dry cough followed by pneumonia. Most people recover after treatment with antibiotics and Dr Donaghy said other cases may have gone unreported.

"One of the features of this phenomenon is that we've only seen it in Scotland," he said. "We're working closely with colleagues in England to find out the reasons for that. Are our services better at picking it up, or is it something to do with the nature of compost up here? We've got no evidence it's anything to do with the compost so we think it's more to do with being better at picking it up."

Like all forms of legionnaire's disease, _L. longbeachae_ is transmitted via very small droplets of water in the air. All those who have contracted the illness so far were very keen gardeners, using different brands of compost. Specialists are now investigating whether recent changes to compost formulas might be to blame as manufacturers move away from traditional peat-based growing media. Health Protection Scotland is in discussions with the Scottish government on whether Australian-style warning labels should be recommended to manufacturers.

A spokesman for the Growing Media Association said: "Since 1990, of the 12 reported cases of legionellosis potentially connected to the _L. longbeachae_ microbe in Great Britain, only 3 are thought to be related to gardening.

"In the same period, the UK public has used well over a billion bags of compost. The exceptional rarity of these cases would seem to indicate that any associated risks are exceedingly minimal." The spokesman added: "Nevertheless, the growing media industry is committed to acting in a responsible manner on this important issue and is therefore conducting a detailed global analysis of the situation. For the moment, appropriate precautionary/hygiene measures are unclear, an observation supported by Health Protection Scotland."

A spokesperson for the Association of Organics Recycling added that compost is routinely heated to at least 60 deg C [140 deg F] for 48 hours as part of the manufacturing process, which is considerably hotter than the preferred temperature for _Legionella_ bacteria.

[Legionellosis is an infectious disease caused by a Gram negative bacillus of the genus _Legionella_, most commonly _Legionella pneumophila_. Legionnaires' disease is the acute pneumonic form of the disease; more than 70 percent of cases are due to _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1, except in Australia and New Zealand, where _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 has accounted for only 45.7 percent of cases of community-acquired legionellosis, and _Legionella longbeachae_ has accounted for 30.4 percent of cases (Yu VL, et al: Distribution of _Legionella_ species and serogroups isolated by culture in patients with sporadic community-acquired legionellosis: An international collaborative survey. J Infect Dis. 2002; 186(1): 127-8. Available at http://www.legionella.org/lp_distribution.pdf).

Unlike _L. pneumophila_, which can be found in natural aquatic bodies, including rivers, lakes, and thermally polluted waters, _L. longbeachae_ is found predominantly in soil and potting mix (Ross IS, Mee BJ, Riley TV: _Legionella longbeachae_ in Western Australian potting mix. Med J Aust 1997; 166(7): 387). Australian potting soil is reportedly not sterilized during manufacture and contains a complex mixture of bacteria and free-living amoebae; elevated storage temperatures appear to foster the intra-amoebic growth of _L. longbeachae_ in potting soil. Genotyping has shown only minor differences between patient and environmental isolates of this organism (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC183249/).

The primary transmission mode is believed to be inhalation of dust from contaminated potting mix, compost, or soil. Wetting down the potting mix to reduce the dust and wearing a facemask when using potting mix have been suggested as methods to prevent infection with this organism (http://www.health.nsw.gov.au/factsheets/infectious/legionnaires.html).

_L. longbeachae_ was first isolated from a patient in Long Beach, California. In addition to Australia and New Zealand, cases of legionnaires' disease due to _L. longbeachae_ have been reported in other countries including the USA (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis, potting soil - USA: May-Jun 2000 20000904.1503), Japan (Koide M, Saito A, Okazaki M, et al. Isolation of _Legionella longbeachae_ serogroup 1 from potting soils in Japan. Clin Infect Dis 1999; 29(4): 943-4; available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/4/943.long; and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17929472), and the UK (ProMED-mail post Legionellosis, hotel - UK (02): (Scotland) background 20110328.0974).

Genotyping of patient and environmental isolates has become a helpful tool to establish transmission pathways. The predominance of one genotype of _Legionella_ isolated from patient specimens suggests transmission from a common source. Because _Legionella_ may be found in environmental samples without linkage to any cases of legionellosis, the actual causative infectious reservoir can be confirmed by matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC86783/ and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2730281/). However, clinical isolates are often not available because the clinical diagnosis of legionnaires' disease is commonly made on the basis of serology or the _Legionella_ urinary antigen test, and not culture of patient specimens.
