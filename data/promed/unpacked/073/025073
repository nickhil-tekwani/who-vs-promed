The European Commission said on Thursday it would step up legal
action against France's continued ban on imports of British beef.
Following is a chronology of related scientific and political events

November 1986 - "Mad cow'' disease or BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy) is first identified by the British government's
Central Veterinary Laboratory.
December 1987 - Scientific tests reveal practice of feeding meat
and bone meal containing animal parts to cattle caused BSE.
June 1988 - Britain stops feeding meat and bone meal to cattle.
July 1989 - EU bans export of British cattle born before July 18,
1988 and the offspring of infected animals.
April 1990 - Edinburgh-based Spongiform Encephalopathy
Advisory Committee (SEAC) is founded to lead research into BSE.
March 1991 - First case of BSE in cattle born after the 1988 meat
and bone meal ban is registered.
July 1993 - 100,000th confirmed case of BSE in Britain.
July 1994 - European Commission says British exports of beef-on-
the-bone can only come from herds which have been BSE-free for
at least 6 years.
March 1996 - SEAC says special unit looking into human
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) has concluded the most likely
explanation for nvCJD is exposure to BSE before 1989 offal ban.
March 1996 - EU imposes worldwide ban on beef exports from
Britain, including live bovine animals, semen, embryos and meat of
bovine animals slaughtered in Britain, also materials used in
manufacture of medical products, cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.
April 1996 - Britain stops selling meat from cattle aged over 30
months.
May 1996 - British government declares "policy of non-
cooperation'' with EU.
June 1996 - EU heads of state agree framework for lifting export
ban at Florence summit. Britain ends non-cooperation policy. EU
reauthorises exports of gelatine, tallow and semen.
July/August 1997 - Illegal shipments of British beef are found in
various EU countries. Germany leads call for tighter British
controls on exports.
October 1997 - Britain formally introduces date-based scheme
covering mainland Britain and meat from animals born after August
1, 1996.
January 1998 - Britain bans sale and import (sic) of all beef-on-the-
bone after SEAC says there is a small chance that BSE could be
transmitted in nerve tissue, including the spinal column and bone
marrow.
March 1998 - EU farm ministers give go-ahead for Northern
Ireland to start sending first British beef shipments to foreign
supermarket shelves under special export scheme.

remaining ban on exports of mainland British beef.

beef exports, effective August 1.
August 3, 1999 - Germany says it will continue to ban sales of
British beef because of fears of BSE.
October 1, 1999 - France says it is maintaining its embargo on
imports of British beef on the grounds that there were insufficient
"scientific guarantees'' to lift the import ban.
October 29, 1999 - European Commission's top scientists give
British beef a clean bill of health, unanimously rejecting evidence
which France said supported an import ban.
November 3, 1999 - Germany says it will resist lifting ban on British
beef before consumer fears have been allayed.
November 16, 1999 - European Commission launches legal action
against France.

on-the-bone in a move it hopes will convince France and Germany
to lift their embargoes on British beef imports.

ban because of insufficient guarantees on safety. British Prime
Minister Tony Blair says France's decision is totally wrong.
