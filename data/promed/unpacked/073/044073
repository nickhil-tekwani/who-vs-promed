The chikungunya virus has hit another person in Singapore, bringing to 11
the total number of cases so far. The Health Ministry said the latest case
detected on 25 Jan [2008] is a Singaporean with no recent travel history,
who spent some time daily in the Little India area.
The 1st 10 cases of the mosquitoborne disease have all been linked to the
Clive Street area in Little India, and since 14 Jan [2008], the authorities
have screened 1795 people within a 150 metre (0.1 mi) radius of the
affected section. Checks were later expanded to cover a larger area and the
latest case had spent time within the extended screening area.
More than 3200 inspections have been conducted so far. NEA [National
environment Agency) has stepped up its operations to Rochor Road, Race
Course Road, Lavender Road and Jalan Besar. A total of 63 breeding sites
have also been found and destroyed.
Of the 11 cases, 9 were admitted at the Communicable Disease Centre for
isolation and management. All have been discharged, except for 2 who are
still under observation, including the latest case.
Residents and owners of premises have been advised to check their area
daily to remove any stagnant water that may breed mosquitoes.
People infected with chikungunya fever should stay indoors to reduce the
risk of further transmission of the virus. Those who have been in the Clive
Street area recently and have developed a fever are advised to consult
their doctors.

[One hopes that with the vigorous campaign to eliminate vector mosquito
breeding sites, this will be the last chikungunya virus infection in
Singapore. An interactive HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of Singapore can be
