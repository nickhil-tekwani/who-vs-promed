-----------------------------------------------------------
"Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection that affects people who have waded through flood waters contaminated with the urine of rats and dogs."

There is a relationship involved that needs to be understood in order for communities to respond appropriately to leptospirosis outbreaks, especially in the wake of flooding. The leading rat predators in most of the developing world are street dogs. Street dogs are also major competitors with rats in consuming food waste and undigested food remnants in animal and human excrement.

Following a flood, a great deal of material that dogs and rats find edible tends to be distributed wherever the water rose and people are mucking out homes and businesses. Since rats are very good at surviving floods, and breed quite rapidly when a new food source becomes available, rats proliferate almost as rapidly as the water recedes -- and of course shed leptospirosis spirochetes.

Because flooding tends to rapidly overburden whatever latrines, ditches, etc. are used to convey human waste out of developing world shantytowns and densely populated urban areas, human water sources become contaminated, and human deaths from leptospirosis follow. Unfortunately, at this point municipal authorities desperate to regain public confidence typically blame dogs for the outbreaks, and order dog massacres, which in turn allow the rats to proliferate even faster. Alternatively, attempts may be made to poison both dogs and rats by distributing lethal substances among the post-flooding debris piles. This tends to become a water contamination problem in itself.

The long-term solutions to leptospirosis include better flood water containment, better drainage, better plumbing and sewage control systems, better municipal waste and refuse collection, and -- as their food sources and habitat niches diminish -- far fewer rats and street dogs. Short-term, though, the safest practice tends to be to leave the dogs alone, let the dogs deal with the rats, and meanwhile focus on removing edible debris and restoring clean drinking water.
