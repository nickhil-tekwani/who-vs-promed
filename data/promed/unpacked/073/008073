Dengue fever has already hit more than 3700 people and caused 3 deaths in Thailand this year [2015].

Of all provinces, Rayong, Samut Songkhram, Krabi, Nakhon Pathom and Phet Buri have reported the highest dengue-fever incidence between 1 Jan and 1 Mar [2015].

Because mosquitoes are the carriers of this dangerous disease, relevant authorities have now come up with a plan to rid possible breeding grounds of mosquito larvae every 6-7 days. Mosquitoes can lay their eggs in still water, including water in drip trays of tree pots.

As a precaution, people are advised to use mosquito repellent. "If a mosquito bites a patient and goes on to bite another person, it spreads the disease further," Disease Control Department's director general Dr Sopon Mekthon says.

According to him, symptoms develop 5-8 days after the infection. While people can recover with the help of some medicines and enough rest, some patients will need serious medical attention. "Having high fever of over 38.5 C [101 F] for over 2 days, loss of appetite, and vomiting are bad signs," Sopon says.

While the number of dengue-fever cases usually soars in the rainy season, the disease can hit people during any season of the year. Statistics show the disease has caused deaths in Thailand every year.

In 2013, a total of 150 934 people came down with dengue fever in Thailand. Of them, 133 died. The number of patients overall also doubled when compared with a year earlier [2012].

The situation update on dengue in the Western Pacific Region of the World Health Organization (WHO-WPRO) as of 24 Feb 2015 indicates that only Malaysia has reported a higher total number of dengue cases in 2015 (as of 14 Feb 2015) if compared with same period in the previous year (a 58 percent increase compared to 2014) http://www.wpro.who.int/emerging_diseases/dengue_biweekly_20150224.pdf?ua=1.

[Unusual patterns of dengue, especially in dry season or in adults, may lead to delayed disease recognition and referral between days 3-7, which is the critical phase when the temperature subsides. This is compounded by the fact that the patient him/herself, family members or caregivers believe that the patient gets better when there is no more fever.

Other setbacks in dengue management during the febrile phase are febrile convulsion, acetaminophen (antipyretic) overdose, or even worse, the use of acetyl salicylic acid (aspirin), which is contra-indicated but used because of a misunderstanding of its comparative efficacy on fever reduction if compared with that of acetaminophen. Also, in rural settings whose laboratory support is not adequate, fluid overload is also observed.

Overall, severe cases of dengue are quite delicate to manage, and fatal outcomes in a short period of time are shocking news for parents.
