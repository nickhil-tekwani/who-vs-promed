Human surveillance: results of 2004 program (revised 31 Dec 2004)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[The last update posted on the Health Canada website on 17 Nov 2004
gave the total number of probable and confirmed human cases of West
Nile virus infection in Canada during the 2004 season as 29: Alberta
- 2 cases, (one case travel-related); Manitoba - 3 cases (2
travel-related); Ontario - 13 cases (2 travel-related); Quebec - one
case; Saskatchewan - 10 cases. No deaths had been reported. - Mod.CP]

As of 31 Dec 2004, revised figures for the 2004 season have been
posted on the Health Canada web-site, reducing the total number of
probable and confirmed cases of West Nile virus infection in all of
Canada from 29 to 25: Alberta - one travel-related case (down one);
Manitoba - 3 cases (unchanged, but only one travel-related now),
Ontario - 13 cases (unchanged, but only one travel-related now),
Quebec - 3 cases (up 2), and Saskatchewan - 5 cases (down 5). No
deaths have been recorded.

[As before, the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward
Island, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia, Yukon
Territory, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut have not reported
confirmed cases of West Nile virus in 2004 in any host species. -

[2] USA - 5th WNV-positive bird in California

USA: 5th confirmed West Nile virus-positive bird in California
--------------------------------------------------------------
A dead crow found in Valencia has tested positive for West Nile virus
(WNV), officials said on Mon 7 Feb 2005, making it the 3rd confirmed
infection statewide so far this year [2005]. The Greater Los Angeles
County Vector Control District confirmed that the Valencia crow,
picked up on Thursday [3 Feb 2005] by the county Department of Animal
Care and Control, tested positive for the virus on Friday. It was the
1st infected bird found in Los Angeles County so far this year.
Elsewhere in the state, one infected crow was picked up from Santa
Clara County, while another was found in Sonoma County.

Vector control and health experts said it was too early to tell
whether the discoveries mean the rate of infection in Southern
California will be the same this year [2005] as last year. Infected
dead crows are often the 1st sign that WNV is in the area. "It's hard
to say why this bird was infected at this time," said Vector Control
spokeswoman Stephanie Miladin. "Last year [2004], we started seeing
them in early March." State health officials said the early
discoveries come as no surprise. California is one of few states that
conducts year-round mosquito surveillance.

"What we experienced in 2004 was that basically we had transmissions
every month starting in February," said Stan Husted, supervising
public health biologist for the state's Department of Health
Services. "We know that we've got West Nile transmission year-round.
Typically, it's really hard to make any predictions, but we know
we're going to have West Nile activity. We know that the 2nd year in
an area is worse than the 1st year. For those areas that have WNV for
the 1st time, we expect there's going to be more activity."

The virus 1st appeared in New York in 1999, and it has since moved
westward, blanketing the nation. According to health experts, WNV is
spread to humans from the bite of an infected mosquito. Mosquitoes
are infected by biting a bird that carries the virus. Most mosquitoes
do not carry the virus, and most people bitten by a mosquito do not
become infected with WNV. The virus is not contagious among humans,
health officials have emphasized. Those who are infected do not
become sick in most cases. But if they do, symptoms include fever,
headache, nausea, body aches and mild skin rashes, health officials
said. California saw its 1st WNV human fatality in 2003. Last year
[2004], there were a total of 828 people infected with WNV from 23
counties statewide. There have been 27 deaths to date in California
from Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and Tehama
counties.

"It will be a while, maybe several years, before West Nile virus dies
down to low levels," Husted said, adding that the state vector
control agencies have worked to keep mosquito populations down, which
may help in the summer months. This year [2005], state health
officials will collect fewer crows, but will ask the public's help in
reporting dead birds by posting sightings on
<http://www.westnile.ca.gov>.
"That's what's going to give us a lot of information," Husted said.

In the meantime, health officials are encouraging residents to
continue taking the same precautions as in the summer months, such as
eliminating sources of standing water where mosquitoes are likely to
lay eggs; using insect repellent containing DEET; avoiding areas with
mosquitoes, especially around dusk and dawn; and securing window
screens that may have holes.

[3] USA - 1st (suspected) human case in California
Date: Wed 9 Feb 2005

USA: 1st suspected West Nile virus human case of 2005 in California
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The 1st human case of West Nile virus in Los Angeles County this year
[2005] was reported on Tue 8 Feb 2005, months before the
mosquito-borne illness usually appears and prompting health officials
to remind people to take precautions. An elderly man, who resides in
the eastern part of the county, is recovering after he was
hospitalized with fevers and altered consciousness, said Dr. Jonathan
Fielding, health officer for the county Department of Health Services.

Fielding said a bird infected with the mosquito-borne virus was
reported on Mon 7 Feb 2005, but it was unknown whether the bird was
the source of the man's infection. The man, whose identity was
withheld to protect his privacy, was infected near his home. "I don't
think we should be alarmed," Fielding said, referring to a possible
repeat of last year's [2004] outbreak that infected more than 800
people and killed 27 statewide. "We can have sporadic cases ... We
have to assume that we're going to have a serious problem, and we
like to be surprised."

The case could be the 1st human case in California this year [2005],
but it has not been confirmed by the state Department of Health
Services, said spokesman Robert Miller. In Los Angeles County, which
had the most cases of any of California's 58 counties, 329 people
were infected and 13 died from the virus. West Nile virus 1st
appeared in California in 2003 and infected 3 people in Southern
California. Health officials said the worst outbreaks usually occur
in the 2nd year in many states. In Colorado, for example, nearly 3000
people were infected and 63 people died in 2003, the 2nd year of the
outbreak.

Ken Fujioka, assistant manager of the San Gabriel Valley Mosquito and
Vector Control District, said the recent storms and warm evening
temperatures may contribute to the spread of the virus. "We're
worried that any time it gets warm during the winter, there's that
potential for mosquitoes," he said.
