LCMV Transmitted Through Solid Organ Transplantation
----------------------------------------------------
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is a rodent-borne
arenavirus found worldwide. House mice (_Mus musculus_) are the
natural reservoir, but LCMV also can infect other wild, pet, and
laboratory rodents (e.g., rats, mice, guinea pigs, and hamsters).
Humans can be infected through exposure to rodent excreta. Person-to-
person transmission has occurred only through maternal-fetal
transmission and solid organ transplantation (1--3). LCMV infection
in humans can be asymptomatic or cause a spectrum of illness ranging
from isolated fever to meningitis and encephalitis. Overall case
fatality is greater than 1 percent.

Fetal infections can result in congenital abnormalities or death.
Immunosuppressed patients, such as organ transplant recipients, can
develop fatal hemorrhagic fever-like disease. Transmission of LCMV
and an LCMV-like arenavirus via organ transplantation has been
documented in 3 previous clusters (1,2). Of 11 recipients described
in those clusters, 10 died of multisystem organ failure, with
LCMV-associated hepatitis as a prominent feature. The surviving
patient was treated with ribavirin (an antiviral with in vitro
activity against LCMV) and reduction of immunosuppressive therapy.

On 15 Apr 2008, an organ procurement organization (OPO) notified CDC
of severe illness in 2 kidney transplant recipients from a common
donor in Massachusetts; at the time of notification, one of the
recipients had died. Samples from the donor and both recipients were
tested at CDC; on 22 Apr 2008, test results revealed evidence of
acute LCMV infection in the donor and both recipients. This report
summarizes the results of the subsequent public health investigation.

Organ Donor
-----------
The organ donor was a man aged 49 years with a history of alcohol
abuse who was hospitalized in early March 2008 after a seizure. On
admission, he was awake but confused and had a fever of 101.9 deg F
(38.8 deg C). Chest radiography, lumbar puncture, and blood cultures
were performed. The chest radiograph showed no evidence of pneumonia.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained 478 white blood cells/mm3 (96
percent lymphocytes), one red blood cell/mm3, 161 mg/dL protein, and
60 mg/dL glucose. The patient was treated empirically for possible
herpes simplex encephalitis and bacterial meningitis with acyclovir,
ceftriaxone, and vancomycin. Gram stain and culture for bacterial
pathogens and herpes simplex virus-1/2 polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) were negative in CSF. Blood cultures grew methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus in one of 4 bottles. Two days later, on 9 Mar
2008, the patient experienced cardiac arrest; he was resuscitated but
never regained consciousness. Nonsurvivable anoxic brain injury was
determined, and life support was withdrawn.

Standard serologic donor screening tests showed no evidence of active
infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C
viruses (HBV and HCV), human T-lymphotropic virus, and syphilis. In
addition, HIV, HBV, and HCV nucleic acid tests were negative. An
autopsy was not performed. After the donor met OPO criteria for organ
donation and consent was obtained from the family, 2 kidneys were
recovered for transplantation on 13 Mar 2008. No other organs or
tissues were recovered for transplantation. On 22 Apr 2008, archived
serum collected the day before death tested positive for anti-LCMV
immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Kidney Recipient A
------------------
Kidney recipient A was a woman aged 70 years with end-stage renal
disease caused by nephrotic syndrome; she received a kidney
transplant from the donor in mid-March 2008. She was readmitted 3
weeks posttransplant with lethargy and anorexia; she developed
low-grade fever and shock, followed by hepatic insufficiency and
multisystem organ failure. She died 4 weeks posttransplant. On 22 Apr
2008, archived whole blood collected on the day of death had evidence
of acute LCMV infection by PCR and virus isolation. Multiple autopsy
specimens, including liver, kidney, and spleen, stained positive for
LCMV antigens by immunohistochemistry.

Kidney Recipient B
------------------
Kidney recipient B was a man aged 57 years with end-stage renal
disease caused by hypertension; he received a kidney transplant from
the donor in mid-March 2008. He was readmitted 2 weeks posttransplant
with fever and developed multisystem organ failure with severe
hepatitis. His immunosuppressive medications were discontinued, he
was given 1 dose of intravenous immunoglobulin, and ribavirin was
started after acute LCMV infection was confirmed on 22 Apr 2008 (6
weeks posttransplant), when his serum tested positive for anti-LCMV
IgM by ELISA. The serum also tested positive for LCMV by virus
isolation, and a liver biopsy was positive for LCMV antigens by
immunohistochemistry. Whole blood tested positive for LCMV by PCR,
and the sequence was an exact match to the fragment amplified from
the 1st kidney recipient. The patient had severe coagulopathy and
developed multiple bacteremias in addition to LCMV viremia. He died
10 weeks posttransplant despite intensive supportive care.

Public Health Investigation
---------------------------
Results of laboratory testing indicated that the donor was the source
of LCMV infection. The subsequent public health investigation
included an assessment of the donor's potential sites of exposure to
rodents, medical record review, and dissemination of educational
information about LCMV to the general, medical, and public health
communities. No test for LCMV infection is approved by the Food and
Drug Administration for organ donor screening. In addition to LCMV,
other pathogens have been transmitted by organ transplantation with
fatal results; in some of these clusters, the donors have been
asymptomatic. However, donors with aseptic meningitis or encephalitis
pose a recognizable risk for transmitting infections that might be
fatal to recipients. Risks and benefits to potential transplant
recipients in offering and accepting organs from such donors should
be considered carefully.

Health-care providers should consider LCMV infection in patients with
aseptic meningitis and encephalitis and in organ transplant
recipients with unexplained fever, hepatitis, or multisystem organ
failure. Transplant centers and OPOs should be aware of the risk for
organ transplant-transmitted infections, report poor outcomes
promptly, and initiate appropriate testing.

Persons with rodent contact should be aware of LCMV and take measures
to prevent infection. Clinicians should ask about history of rodent
contact in patients with aseptic meningitis.

[This report concludes the investigation of the transmission of LCMV
by organ transplantation which occurred in Massachusetts earlier this
year (see the ProMED-mail archived references below). It now confirms
that both recipients of a kidney from a LCMV-infected donor have
died. This demonstrates how a normally benign virus can become highly
lethal. LCMV infection in humans can be asymptomatic or rarely cause
a spectrum of illness ranging from isolated fever to meningitis and
encephalitis. Overall case fatality is greater than 1 percent. Fetal
infections can result in congenital abnormalities or death.
Immunosuppressed patients, such as organ transplant recipients, can
develop fatal hemorrhagic fever-like disease. Ten of 11 recipients of
LCMV-contaminated organs have died.

It is appropriate here to reiterate some of the concluding statements
of this report. Namely, health-care providers should consider LCMV
infection in patients with aseptic meningitis and encephalitis and in
organ transplant recipients with unexplained fever, hepatitis, or
multisystem organ failure. Transplant centers and organ procurement
agencies should be aware of the risk for organ transplant-transmitted
infections, report poor outcomes promptly, and initiate appropriate
testing. Persons with rodent contact should be aware of LCMV and take
measures to prevent infection. Clinicians should ask about history of
rodent contact in patients with aseptic meningitis. - Mod.CP

It is interesting that the antiviral acyclovir did not get rid of the
LCM virus. The donor must have had contact with wild rodents to have
become infected, but we are not told if he was homeless and lived in
conditions in which he could have had contact with them. Without an
approved test for LCMV, donated organs cannot be screend for it. But
the use of organs from alcoholics would seem to carry an elevated
risk. - Mod.JW]
