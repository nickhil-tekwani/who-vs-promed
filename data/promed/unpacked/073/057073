A Response to Dr. Robert Wheeler's Request for Information
----------------------------------------------------------
[Dr. Brad Walsh has sent this reply to Dr. Wheeler's request for
information : see ProMED-mail post entitled: "Norwalk-like virus,
decontamination: RFI 20020612.4475"]
You might start by reading the following article on the CDC website
about hospital surface cleanliness:
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/hip/guide/handwash.htm#housekeeping>
In it they don't specify any cleaning products, referring you to the
"list of EPA-approved disinfectants." It appears you can find that
list at: <http://www.epa.gov/oppad001/chemregindex.htm>
Hope that helps.

An Alternative to Chlorine-based Biocides
-----------------------------------------
The request for information from Dr. Wheeler [see: " Norwalk-like
virus, decontamination: RFI 20020612.4475"] was forwarded to me for
my opinion. The moderator requested a possible alternative to
chlorine-based biocides to battle Norwalk virus and Norwalk-like
viruses (NLV). Undoubtedly, chlorine bleach (NaHCl) at 5000 - 10 000
ppm will have a cidal affect on the pathogen but is, as is noted,
very harmful to surfaces, equipment and users. Perhaps the concern
for worker safety would even eclipse the sanitizing effects.
A Canadian-made and widely accepted possible alternative is
Accelerated Hydrogen Peroxide (AHP). Several disinfectant products,
including a high-level disinfectant, have been created with this
remarkable (my opinion) technology. Developed and manufactured by
Virox Technologies Inc () of
Toronto, AHP has documented cidal affects against non-enveloped
viruses. AHP disinfectants were tested against Poliovirus type 1
(Sabin) with standard organic and hard water challenges, and were
found to reduce the pathogen by almost 99.999 percent with a 5-minute
contact time. Documented evidence against poliovirus allows
manufacturers to claim efficacy against all non-enveloped viruses,
including Norwalk virus and NLV.
Further, the manufactures have shown that the in-use dilution of the
disinfectant that employs AHP technology is safe on all
colour-stabilized fabrics (including carpet, drapery, air filters,
etc.) and most metals. Some soft metals, when left to soak for a
longer period of time, exhibit corrosion. The product is marketed as
safe for contact with skin, eyes, respiratory and digestive systems,
and has no noticeable odour or colour additives.
I put forward that this may be an acceptable alternative to
chlorine-based biocides. To my knowledge is it as yet unavailable in
the United States, but widely distributed and used in Canada and
other nations.
