The information contained within this update is obtained from data provided
by ministries of health of member states and national influenza centers
through reports sent to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) or
updates on their web pages.

Evolution of the pandemic
-------------------------
North America:
In Canada, in EW 1 [epidemiological week 1 (3-9 Jan 2010)], the national
influenza-like illness (ILI) consultation rate decreased as compared to EW
52 [2009] and remained below the historical average. The overall number of
hospitalizations, ICU [intensive care unit] admissions, and deaths
associated with the pandemic virus remained low, as compared to the levels
seen in October and November 2009. A total of 10 oseltamivir-resistant
isolates have been detected since April 2009.

In Mexico, from EW 51 to EW 52 [2009], there was a 19 per cent decrease in
the number of ILI and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) cases, and
activity has now been decreasing for 10 consecutive weeks.

In the United States, the proportion of outpatient consultations for ILI
decreased in EW 01 and fell below the national baseline. Just one of 10
sub-national surveillance regions reported the proportion of outpatient
visits for ILI to be above its region-specific baseline.
Laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization rates remained stable but
high, especially in children 0-4 years of age. The proportion of deaths
attributed to pneumonia and influenza remained below the epidemic
threshold. A total of 7 influenza-associated pediatric deaths were
reported, of which 6 were associated with the pandemic virus. A total of 52
oseltamivir-resistant isolates have been detected since April 2009.

Caribbean:
These countries reported variable spread of influenza and decreasing or
unchanged trends in acute respiratory disease. The Bahamas and Dominica
reported low/moderate intensity of acute respiratory disease, however
Belize reported high intensity. Low and moderate impact of acute
respiratory disease on health care services was reported by these
countries. Of note, Dominica continued to report no influenza activity.

Central America:
Costa Rica and Panama reported widespread influenza activity, decreasing
trends in acute respiratory disease, low/moderate intensity of acute
respiratory disease, and low impact of acute respiratory disease on health
care services.

South America -- Andean:
Influenza activity was reported as widespread in Ecuador and Venezuela,
localized in Colombia, and with no activity in Bolivia. Acute respiratory
disease trends were reported mostly as decreasing or unchanged. The
intensity of acute respiratory disease and the impact of acute respiratory
disease on health-care services were reported as low or moderate for these
countries.

South America -- Southern Cone:
Influenza activity was reported as regional in Brazil and Chile, and
localized in Paraguay. The trends of acute respiratory disease were
reported as increasing in Paraguay, decreasing in Brazil, and unchanged in
Chile. These countries reported low/moderate intensity of acute respiratory
disease, and low impact of acute respiratory disease on health care
services. Paraguay (EW 01) reported an increased number of consultations
for ILI and SARI (21.9 per cent and 46.3 per cent, respectively) as
compared to EW 52 [2009]. Eleven of 17 departments reported increasing
trends of acute respiratory disease, and 15 of 17 departments reported high
or very high intensity of acute respiratory disease. According to the
latest data available for Argentina and Chile (EW 51 and EW 52,
respectively), these countries had a low incidence of ILI (0.4 and 1.3 per
100 000 population, respectively). In Argentina, this incidence has
remained under the epidemic threshold for 12 consecutive weeks.

[Overall, the pandemic is subsiding throughout the Americas. The PAHO
weekly summary states that:

- in North America, acute respiratory disease activity continued to
decrease and is lower than expected in most areas.
- in the Caribbean, all countries reported unchanged and decreasing trends
in acute respiratory disease.
- Central American countries reported decreasing trends in acute
respiratory disease.
- South American countries reported mostly decreasing or unchanged trends
of acute respiratory disease, except Paraguay, which reported an increasing
trend.
- in North America, a median of 100 per cent of subtyped influenza A
viruses were pandemic (H1N1) 2009 [virus infection].
- 79 new confirmed deaths in 6 countries were reported; in total, there
have been 7094 cumulative confirmed deaths.
- in countries providing data, SARI hospitalization incidence in EW 52
[2009] decreased as compared to the previous week.
