The Alabama Department of Public Health is investigating a foodborne outbreak that has affected at least 36 people who ate a meal at a funeral. Around noon on Sat 6 Jul 2013, people attending a funeral at Eastern Star Baptist Church in York, Alabama, ate an undisclosed dish that made them sick. More than 100 people are reported to have attended this funeral.

Initial reports indicate that at least 30 have been hospitalized, with some in serious condition. The ongoing investigation has involved hospitals in at least 9 states. These states currently include Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Oklahoma.

Preliminary tests at the Alabama Bureau of Clinical Laboratories are positive for _Salmonella_, and additional tests are pending.

ADPH's investigation began on 8 Jul 2013 after a report from a local hospital that 25 people had been seeking emergency room care late on 6 Jul 2013 and 7 Jul 2013 -- and 7 with symptoms of fever, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.

"If you attended this event and are ill, please contact your physician," advised Dr. Mary McIntyre, Assistant State Health Officer for Disease Control and Prevention.
