[My colleague Bill Hubbert once commented that while diseases may be
restrained by national boundaries, infections are not. Thus, noting the
distribution in the USA one must ask whether human &/or animal infections
have been noted in Mexico, specifically in Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango, and
Zacatecas. Whereas the Ecuador/Northern Peru cluster is coherent, is the
Bolivian distribution only in that country or are similar infections noted
in northern Chile & Argentina? - Mod.MHJ
