Abstract
--------
Among the many questions unanswered for the COVID-19 pandemic are the origin of SARS-CoV-2 and the potential role of intermediate animal host(s) in the early animal-to-human transmission. The discovery of RaTG13 bat coronavirus in China suggested a high probability of a bat origin. Here we report molecular and serological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses (SC2r-CoVs) actively circulating in bats in Southeast Asia. Whole genome sequences were obtained from 5 independent bats (_Rhinolophus acuminatus_) in a Thai cave yielding a single isolate (named RacCS203) which is most related to the RmYN02 isolate found in _R. malayanus_ in Yunnan, China. SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies were also detected in bats of the same colony and in a pangolin at a wildlife checkpoint in Southern Thailand. Antisera raised against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of RmYN02 was able to cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 despite the fact that the RBD of RacCS203 or RmYN02 failed to bind ACE2. Although the origin of the virus remains unresolved, our study extended the geographic distribution of genetically diverse SC2r-CoVs from Japan and China to Thailand over a 4800-km [about 2983 mi] range. Cross-border surveillance is urgently needed to find the immediate progenitor virus of SARS-CoV-2.

[_Rhinolophus_ species (horseshoe bats) were found to carry a diverse group of SARS-like coronaviruses and, thus, are thought to be the natural reservoirs of this group of viruses. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 shares approximately 80% and 96.2% nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV RaTG13, respectively. This high homology suggests that SARS-CoV-2 might have originated from bats. However, whether transmission from bats to humans was direct or through an intermediate animal host remains to be determined.

Pangolins are peculiar mammals of the order Pholidota, with only one extant taxonomic family, Manidae. There are 8 living species grouped in 3 genera. _Manis_ comprises the 4 species found in Asia, while _Phataginus_ and _Smutsia_ each include 2 species living in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Pangolins entered in the COVID-19 discussion when they were suggested as the possible source of infection for humans, acting as a bridge species which hypothetically exposed humans to a coronavirus that naturally circulates in bats of the genus _Rhinolophus_. This contention was based on genetic comparison of coronaviruses taken from pangolins and SARS-CoV-2 from humans (99% similar), and also on the affinity of SARS-like CoV for pangolin's receptors.

Malayan pangolins (_Manis javanica_) confiscated from smugglers in China (collected in August 2017-January 2018) tested positive to coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2.

African pangolins were reported sharing burrows with bats, proving that at least those African species of pangolins and bats interact and therefore there is opportunity for pathogen exchange. Some _Rhinolophus_ species are known to use underground burrows, just like pangolins. During winter, _R. hipposideros_ can be found hibernating mainly in underground sites including cellars, small caves, and burrows. - Mod.PMB]
