HEPATITIS B VACCINE NOT CAUSE OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS

Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) - Lack of evidence that hepatitis B
vaccine causes multiple sclerosis:
During the past year, articles in the French popular press and television
programmes have raised concerns among the French public that hepatitis B (HB)
immunization may be linked to new cases or flare-ups of multiple sclerosis
(MS) or other demyelinating diseases. These concerns have led to significant
reductions in the uptake of HB vaccine in France, and misinformation on this
subject may spread to other countries. Since the scientific data do not
support the idea that HB vaccine causes or exacerbates MS, and since
universal childhood and/or adolescent immunization with HB vaccine is now a
policy in 85 countries, this has the potential to cause significant damage to
important public health programmes.
HB immunization of health care workers, which has been recommended in most
countries, became mandatory in France in 1991, ensuring HB immunization of
hundreds of thousands of young and middle-aged adults, many of them women who
are in the age group at the highest risk of MS. More recently, one
neurologist publicized the fact that he had seen several cases of MS or
demyelinating disease in women who had received HB vaccine. This was picked
up by anti-vaccination groups, and a number of patients with MS now claim
that their disease was caused or exacerbated by HB vaccine...
...An association between MS exacerbations and infectious diseases has been
suggested, but there is little evidence to support this. Aside from
hypotheses and individual case reports, there is no actual evidence
supporting a causal association between MS exacerbations and any vaccine.

(1) There is no evidence of an association between hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection and MS or other demyelinating diseases. Globally, there are 350
million chronically infected carriers of HBV and 2 000 million persons have
evidence of past infection. The geographical incidence and prevalence of HB
are the opposite of those for MS, Scandinavia and Northern Europe having the
highest rates of MS and the lowest rates for HBV infection, while sub-Saharan
Africa and Asia have the lowest rates of MS and the highest rates of HBV. If
the virus does not cause MS, it is unlikely that the vaccine, which is the
surface coat of the virus, could do so.
(2) Published and unpublished studies looking for an increased rate of MS,
exacerbations of MS, or other demyelinating disease in recipients of HB
vaccines have found no such increase. Among the more than 550 million
individuals who have been immunized with HB vaccines since 1982, no evidence
of a causal association with MS or other demyelinating diseases has ever been
demonstrated...
(3) Analysis of the reported cases in France: The results of an official
pharmacovigilance study on the neurological tolerance of all HB vaccines
available in France (Engerix B, GenHevac and HB-VAX DNA) were presented to
the National Commission of Pharmacovigilance in December 1994 and in December
1996. The data showed the following: ... The notification rate of
demyelinating diseases in temporal association with HB vaccination was 1.8
cases per million doses or approximately 0.6 cases per 100 000 vaccinees.
The latter rate is significantly lower than the expected incidence of
demyelinating diseases in the same population which, for multiple sclerosis
alone, is 1 to 3 cases per 100 000 persons. The epidemiological patterns of
the notified cases were similar to those expected in a similar non-vaccinated
population in terms of age distribution, gender ratio, and the nature and
severity of neurological symptoms. The time between vaccination and
occurrence of neurological symptoms was random....
While any risk of MS following HB immunization is hypothetical, the risk of
HB infection and disease in non-immunized individuals is real. HB causes an
estimated 4 million acute infections worldwide each year, and currently there
are more than 350 million chronic carriers of HBV, approximately 25% of whom
will die from cirrhosis of the liver or primary liver cancer, diseases which
kill more than 1 million persons per year. For these reasons, WHO has called
for all countries to include routine HB immunization in their national
immunization programmes. More than 85 countries have done so and many more
are planning for the introduction of the vaccine. HB vaccines are safe, more
than 90% effective in preventing disease, and very cost-effective. It is
extremely unfortunate that unsubstantiated claims that HB vaccines might
cause MS are reducing the uptake of this important vaccine.
