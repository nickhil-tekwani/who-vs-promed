An outbreak of Rift Valley fever [RVF] has hit Mandera county with the disease reported in Elwak Sub county where 2 cases involving a sheep and a goat tested positive for the disease. The disease is believed to have spread from Wajir where at least 6 people have died from the fever following livestock migration.

[The above news announcer's text was followed by a 2-minute reportage, presenting Mohammed Arai, the deputy Governor of Mandera county, who reminded to the public the need for animal holders to notify any suspected case immediately when observed. He said that "The county is asking for assistance from the government and humanitarian organisations in controlling the situation" (A link to the TV News video item is available at the source URL).

Mandera is situated north of the county Wajir. According to earlier reports "hundreds of camels, sheep, and goats have died since the disease outbreak" in Wajir, while several dozen cases were reported there in humans, including deaths (see WHO's last press release on RVF, at http://www.who.int/csr/don/18-june-2018-rift-valley-fever-kenya/en/).

Both counties, Wajid and Mandera, have a common border with Somali on the east and Ethiopia on the north. Kenya's interactive administrative map ("Provinces and Counties") is available at https://www.citypopulation.de/php/kenya-admin.php.

Information on the lab test and/or other evidence according to which the 2 described cases, a sheep and a goat, were confirmed, and a description of their clinical situation, will be helpful.

In difference with earlier RVF events in Kenya since June 2018, where human cases heralded the presence of the disease, the 2 disease cases in animals in Mandera have become the sentinels of RVF in this county. This may be indicative of the application of effective surveillance in animals in Mandera. - Mod.AS
