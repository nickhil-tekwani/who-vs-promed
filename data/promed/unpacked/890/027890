EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE - WEST AFRICA (38): SIERRA LEONE PREPAREDNESS

Regarding "Mali preparedness" in ProMED-mail post "Ebola virus disease - West Africa (37)," I went to Sierra Leone with Joseph Fair to set up, with the local MOH and in-country WHO office, an emergency preparedness and response to the ebolavirus disease (EVD) outbreak. I think it would be fair to recognize -- as you did for Mali and Senegal -- the amazing work that has been done in Sierra Leone by all MOH health workers in setting up (thanks to their unique expertise on VHF [viral hemorrhagic fevers] with Lassa fever) an emergency sustainable response on EVD preparedness.

For the 1st time in EVD history, that type of wide preparedness, from clinic, to port health officer -- without closing the border -- to epidemiologist, reporting system, and counseling (still ongoing), has been done in heretofore ebolavirus "virgin" territories, but at high risk, regarding the ethnic groups (in the epidemic epicenter of Kisigoudou) shared with Guinea, which have ultimately protected, or at least uniquely prepared, Sierra Leone.

Not only were the RT-PCR [real-time polymerase chain reaction] tests and the other sophisticated equipment we brought in and trained lab workers on useful, but also and essentially, in the matter of preparedness, case management, case surveillance, community counseling, safe burial, etc. were targeted, which are fundamental to apply before "things" happen (and this is quite unique).

[It is a big advance in global public health to have highly trained virologists and other experts available to travel to the world's outbreaks at short notice and donate state-of-the-art lab equipment and expertise to countries afflicted by serious infectious disease outbreaks.

The Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED) was founded 20 years ago with the idea of establishing a chain of microbial diagnostic labs circling the globe, with the equipment and staff to rapidly detect and identify the cause of any outbreak, whether in humans, animals, or crops, of a potentially dangerous pathogen in order to install control and prevention measures. These would supplement the existing labs established by the Institut Pasteur and The Rockefeller Foundation (the latter long ago handed over to the host countries), mostly in tropical regions.

We never dreamed that the answer would be mobile teams "parachuted" into hotspots. But now, with the recognition that microbes cross national frontiers ever more rapidly thanks to air transport, and that animal, plant, and environmental health are inextricably interdependent (see http://www.onehealthinitiative.com), developed country governments need to take notice of what goes on in less fortunate countries, and subsidize the kind of actions that will prevent the arrival of these pathogens on their own shores: The 2nd case of MERS-CoV was reported today [12 May 2014] to have arrived in the USA from Saudi Arabia, see http://www.promedmail.org/direct.php?id=2466912. - Mod.JW, (Co-founder and Assoc. Ed. ProMED-mail)
