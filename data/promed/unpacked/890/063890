Further avian flu outbreaks confirmed in US; Nebraska cancels shows
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Five more outbreaks of H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) have been confirmed in the United States.

The 5 outbreaks, confirmed by the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, again affected Iowa and Minnesota, and bring the number of confirmed detections to 212.

The newly confirmed outbreaks are:
- Minnesota, Brown County -- 15 900 commercial turkeys;
- Iowa, Clay County -- 1 115 700 commercial chicken;
- Iowa, Hamilton County -- 17 200 commercial turkeys;
- Iowa, Hamilton County -- 26 200 commercial turkeys;
- Minnesota, Kandiyohi County -- 37 000 commercial turkeys.

The total number of birds affected across the US has now reached 46 239 793.

Iowa's number of detections has reached 71, affecting 30 420 500 birds. However, the state has had a break from any new presumed detections. Their Department of Agriculture and Land Stewardship said that 24.1 million of the 27.7 million affected commercial layers and pullets have been euthanised to date, and that disposal is ongoing.

[The disease continues to spread. Is it lack of biosecurity? Do producers really know what it means and how to implement it? I am not suggesting that our producers do not know but rather that there may be a step missed, or someone is perhaps more lax than they ought to be. Are the trucks for feed, for litter removal, for decontamination and carcass disposal being thoroughly and completely disinfected? Are personnel operating only on individual premises or is it possible that personnel working or traveling or visiting different premises are tracking the disease with them? Are we [the United States] as a nation looking at all possible ways this virus could spread? Something isn't working and this disease seems like it's winning. - Mod.TG
