China: rabies kills 61 in Hunan province
----------------------------------------
61 people in central China's Hunan Province have died from rabies in the
1st 2 months of the year [2007], leading the vice governor to call for a
cull of dogs in the province.
Gan Lin, vice-governor of Hunan, said the government has to kill
unvaccinated dogs to keep the horrible disease away from people. Rabies
killed 443 people in Hunan in 2006. Rabies was, last year, the country's
most deadly infectious disease.
Since 1996, rabies has killed 2719 people in Hunan, said Gan. The
increasing number of pet dogs and low vaccination rates are blamed for the
rabies epidemic in the province, said Gan, without providing details on the
number of pets that have caused the spread of the disease.
Experts from the Provincial Center of Disease Prevention warn that rabid
dogs and other animals including bats can spread the deadly disease to
humans through a bite or scratch that breaks the skin. The disease can
remain latent for days, months and even years. The disease is always fatal
once symptoms appear.
People who are bitten can be effectively treated [by vaccination] prior to
the onset of symptoms. Like dogs, people can also be vaccinated against the
disease.

[Rabies remains a significant public health problem in many countries of
Asia and Africa, even though safe, effective vaccines for both human and
veterinary use exist. According to WHO, about 55 000 deaths from rabies
(mostly children) are reported annually around the world, and the Chinese
total forms a substantial part of the global total. The total of 61 deaths
(one per day) observed in a single province (where the 10 year total is
2719 deaths) suggests that the Chinese are making little progress in the
control of rabies away from the major coastal cities. The spasmodic
destruction of domestic and feral dogs is an inadequate response to a major
public health crisis.
