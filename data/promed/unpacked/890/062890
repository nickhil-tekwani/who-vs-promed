Abstract
--------
Background: Onchocerciasis is endemic in most local government areas (LGAs) in Enugu and Ogun states. Most meso- and hyper-endemic LGAs have received many rounds of ivermectin mass drug administration (MDA). This study aimed to determine the current prevalence of onchocerciasis in villages in Enugu and Ogun states that were formerly highly endemic and to assess progress toward elimination of the infection in areas believed to be at high risk for persistence.

Methods: Cross-sectional community surveys were conducted 8 to 12 months after the last round of MDA in 16 villages (6 in Enugu state and 10 in Ogun state) in individuals aged ≥ 18 years. Study participants were examined for the presence of palpable subcutaneous nodules. Skin snips from the posterior iliac crests were used to assess microfiladermia (Mf) prevalence and density.

Results: 643 subjects were palpated for nodules and 627 individuals (225 in Enugu state; 402 in Ogun state) provided skin snips. Nodule prevalence in the study villages ranged from 42% to 66.7% in Enugu state and from 0% to 25.0% in Ogun state. Mf prevalence in the Enugu and Ogun study villages ranged from 32% to 51.1% and 0% to 28.6%, respectively. Geometric mean skin Mf density in surveyed Enugu state villages ranged between 1 and 3.1 Mf/mg; these values were < 1 Mf/mg in all but one community in Ogun state villages.

Conclusion: Results from this study show that onchocerciasis persists in adults in many villages in Enugu and Ogun states despite many prior rounds of ivermectin MDA. Prevalence was higher in villages surveyed in Enugu than in Ogun. Low Mf densities suggest the MDA program is working well to reduce disease, but more time will be required to reach the elimination goal.

[Enugu state is in south-central Nigeria, whereas Ogun state is in far southwestern Nigeria, north of Lagos. Both regions have historically been highly endemic for onchocerciasis, and the authors state that some endemic foci in these states have received 14 rounds (Ogun) and 26 rounds (Enugu) of ivermectin MDA for onchocerciasis over more than 20 years. Yet their study shows that the prevalence of microfiladermia (positive skin snips) has remained stubbornly high in Enugu state compared with Ogun state, despite fewer rounds of ivermectin MDA in Ogun. The authors surmise that "this difference may be due to higher baseline infection prevalences and biting rates in Enugu," but it would be interesting to see if there were other factors, such as community engagement or vector control, that led to better outcomes in Ogun.

In ProMED's most recent post on onchocerciasis (see in the See Also section below), data were presented indicating that onchocerciasis infection has declined over the past 2 decades throughout western and central Africa, but that certain areas in Nigeria as well as other countries continue to be highly endemic for onchocerciasis, as measured by mean microfiladermia prevalences exceeding 25%. In my commentary, I discussed the issue of concurrent loiasis as a potential limiting factor in ivermectin MDA campaigns because of rare but serious adverse central nervous effects in _Loa loa_-infected individuals treated with ivermectin. Regions of southern Nigeria can indeed be endemic for loiasis as well as onchocerciasis. However, previous studies have indicated a low prevalence of co-infection in southwestern Nigeria (ref. 1), and very low _L. loa_ microfilaremia counts even in areas of southern Nigeria with high prevalence of loiasis (ref. 2). These studies indicated that ivermectin MDA can be safely delivered in these areas with extremely low risk for adverse events in co-infected individuals, and the current report by Ekpo et al above makes no mention of _L. loa_ co-infection as a limiting factor for preceding rounds of ivermectin MDA in the study populations.
