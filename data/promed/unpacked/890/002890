Abstract
--------
From July 2022, cases of imported diphtheria with toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ remarkably increased among migrants arriving in Germany. Up to 30 Sep 2022, 44 cases have been reported to the national public health institute, all laboratory-confirmed, male, and mainly coming from Syria (n = 21) and Afghanistan (n = 17). Phylogeny and available journey information indicate that most cases (n = 19) were infected along the Balkan route. Active case finding, increased laboratory preparedness and epicentre localisation in countries along this route are important.

[There were 44 cases of diphtheria caused by toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ and 18 cases of diphtheria caused by _Corynebacterium ulcerans_ in the first 9 months of 2022 in Germany. All 18 _C. ulcerans_ cases were acquired locally in Germany, probably related to zoonotic transmission from farm animals or following consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. Of the 44 _C. diphtheriae_ cases, 42 cases were mainly cutaneous diphtheria occurring in migrants who recently arrived in Germany. Two of the 44 _C. diphtheriae_ cases not in migrants were said to be travel-related.

Of the 42 cases in migrants, 41 were reported in a 10-week period, between late July to the end of September 2022; one case in a migrant was reported in May 2022. There were no cases in migrants in 2019, 7 in 2020, and 7 in 2021. Most cases in migrants were detected by medical examinations at reception centers.

Countries of origin, when known, were mostly Syria (n = 21) and Afghanistan (n = 17), with one each from Tunisia and Yemen. Migrants were en route often for months, living under very poor hygienic condition, usually without access to healthcare services. For 23 of the 44 cases with information on transit routes to Germany, most traveled along a Balkan route, i.e., Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia, where they likely acquired diphtheria, based in part on genetic analysis of isolates.

This outbreak among migrants in Germany is reportedly similar to the experience in Austria, Belgium, France, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. - Mod.ML
