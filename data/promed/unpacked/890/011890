The results of anthrax tests taken from 4 suspected cases from Kosh-Terek
village turned out to be negative. The director of the state sanitary
epidemiological surveillance service, Jalaleddin Gaybullin, announced the
negative results on 27 Oct 2009. He said that 4 suspected cases had been
hospitalized and 42 contacts were under observation. However, none of the
contacts developed any signs.

[Our thanks to our Russian colleagues for catching this follow up. The
question then is what was this event that mimicked "anthrax" to produce
that working initial diagnosis with 4 hospitalised cases and 42 under
observation. With such numbers, one can speculate that it initially looked
like gastro-enteric anthrax. And none developed any cutaneous signs. - Mod.MHJ]
