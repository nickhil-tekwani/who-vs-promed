Mirta Riera, national health coordinator for the Un Nuevo Tiempo [left
center political] party, said the current dengue epidemic is the worst that
has existed in [the] Americas over the past 21 years. To date, there are
106 725 cases, more than twice as many as in the same period last year
[2009], when 44 933 cases were recorded. "In addition, 9339 cases of DHF
have been reported in children between 10-11, who are the [age cohort] most
affected since for every 100 000 inhabitants 668.6 are affected.
Furthermore, 113.8 children under one year per 100 000 inhabitants have
been affected." She argued that these figures have been obtained only
through the Pan American Health Organization due to the lack of the health
bulletins the Ministry used to issue and of any official reports.

These figures also show that to date 75 people have died since blood banks
in the country are out of stock of transfusion [supplies] required to
counteract this type of dengue [virus infection].

Riera said that there was a "disaster" in terms of supplies in hospitals
and that this complicates the treatment of cases. In addition, she added,
there is a crisis in relation to professional salaries, which hurts the
health sector even more. The trained professionals required to face an
epidemic are not available to dedicate themselves exclusively to this task.

[Reports from political opposition party representatives, such as the one
above, are likely to be critical of the governmental health care system.
The 19 Nov 2010 edition of El Universal, a non governmental news medium,
(<http://calidaddevida.eluniversal.com/2010/11/19/ten_art_venezuela-concentra_2111162.shtml>,
in Spanish) reported that Venezuela has 26 per cent of the DHF cases in the
Americas. Venezuela has 54 per cent of the DHF cases and, with 106 725
cases, 41 per cent of total cases in the Andean zone (Venezuela, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia). The Venezuelan dengue incidence rate is 360 per
100 000 population (considerably less than the figure in the report above)
compared with 293 per 100 000 population in the Americas. Only 8 countries
(presumably worldwide) have higher incidence rates than Venezuela and
Venezuela is one of 5 countries in which all 4 dengue virus serotypes are
circulating.

[2] Cases in various countries: Philippines, India (Delhi), Pakistan
(Sindh), Peru (Iquitos), Brazil (Alagoas), Brazil (Piaui)


- Philippines (national), 18 Nov 2010: the death toll from dengue fever in
the Philippines has reached 724 since the start of the year (2010), the
Department of Health said Thursday (18 Nov 2010). The deaths recorded from
1 Jan-30 Oct [2010], were up nearly 50 per cent from 485 fatalities in the
same period last year (2009). The health department also recorded a total
of 119 789 cases of dengue infections, an increase of more than 140 per
cent from 49 319 a year ago (2009)
(<http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/354085,fever-hits-724-philippines.html>).

- India (Delhi), 15 Nov 2010: the national capital reported 21 fresh cases
of dengue today, taking the total number of patients affected this season
(2010) to 5994. The cases of dengue generally start showing a downward
trend with the advent of winter as low temperatures and less humidity are
not conducive for the breeding of dengue-carrier _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes. However, this season, a substantial number of cases was being
reported daily till now, officials said. While 21 fresh cases were reported
today [15 Nov 2010], 23 new cases were recorded yesterday [14 Nov 2010].
Officials said 8 people have lost their lives to dengue this season
(<http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_dengue-cases-in-delhi-near-6000_1467035>).

- Pakistan (Sindh), 16 Nov 2010: dengue cases are declining across the
province as the temperature falls. According to the Dengue Surveillance
Cell (DSC), 3016 cases of dengue have been reported thus far of which 2573
are from Karachi and the remaining 443 are from the rest of the province.
The death toll from the virus stands at 21, 16 of which were in Karachi
(<http://tribune.com.pk/story/78003/decline-in-mercury-brings-drop-in-dengue-cases/>).

- Peru (Iquitos), 31 Oct 2010: according to official figures from the
Regional Health Directorate, so far this year (2010), 4348 patients have

Spanish).

- Brazil (Alagoas), 17 Nov 2010: Alagoas has its greatest dengue outbreak
in its history. From 1 Jan-Nov 2010, Alagoas had 50 384 reported dengue
cases, according to the latest Epidemiological Surveillance bulletin of the
state Secretariat of Health. Of these, 32 015 cases and 19 deaths were
confirmed
(<http://www.ojornalweb.com/2010/11/17/alagoas-tem-o-maior-surto-de-dengue-da-historia/>
in Portuguese).
