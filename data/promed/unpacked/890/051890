Rabies kills 7 people
-----------------------
7 people (5 children between 5 and 9 years old and 2 elderly people) have
died since the beginning of the week [3rd week October 2005] in Turiassu
township, 400 km from the state capital, Sao Luis, from rabies transmitted
by the bite of vampire bats.
3 more children and 2 elderly persons have been admitted to the hospital. 5
of the victims came from the village of Antonio Dino, 33 km from the center
of Turiassu, the rest from the village of Porto Santo.
The 1st victim in the area was a 9-year-old boy, bitten near Porto Santo at
the end of August [2005]. He had fever and numbness in some parts of his
body, was admitted to the hospital and died on 5 Aug 2005 [sic; possibly 5
Sep 2005 - Mod.JW].
Since last Thursday [13 Oct 2005], an outbreak began. A 3-year-old boy who
had been bitten on the foot by a bat on 20 Sep 2005 was not seen by a
doctor until 10 Oct 2005 and died on 15 Oct 2005. Then 4 children of the
same family, aged 2, 3, 5 and 6 years, died.
The inhabitants of Antonio Dino said that bat bites were never typical of
the region, but began on 29 Aug 2005 when the regional generator burned
out, leaving the community without electricity for a month and a half.
Since the [transformer] was installed, the number of people complaining of
bat bites has diminished.
Health teams from the National Health Foundation (Funasa) and the state
Secretariat of Health are vaccinating the infected people, who are
principally in high risk populations such as in Antonio Dino and Sao
Sebastiao, where 160 people have been bitten since [the beginning of]
October 2005. According to projections by the Health Secretariat of
Turiassu, around 250 people have been bitten in the neighboring villages of
Antonio Dino, Sao Sebastiao, Santa Rosa, Santa Barbara and Porto Santo.
"Overall, 232 cases have been notified. This is the official figure, but
there are probably more, around 250. Our great problem is lack of awareness
in the population of our township and neighboring regions," said Claudio
Hipolito, town secretary of health.

[Vampire bat rabies occurs sporadically in many parts of Brazil; see refs.
below. One supposes that the local population of this newly affected area
is now tragically aware of the risk. There is no mention of the application
of anti-rabies immunoglobulin, which is essential to complement the
vaccine. I had never heard before of lights keeping vampires at bay;
perhaps a reader can provide a published reference?
Turiassu (Lat. 1 deg 41'S, Long. 45 deg 21'W) lies inside an estuary on the
NE coast of Brazil, see:
