Three more Ebola infections were confirmed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) Equateur province outbreak, raising the total to 46 [43 confirmed, 3 probable], the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said on Twitter today [Thu 9 Jul 2020]. One more death was reported, raising the fatality count to 19.

The event began in early June [2020], signifying the DRC's 11th Ebola outbreak. The transmission is occurring in the northwestern part of the country, and though some cases are occurring in remote parts of the province, some cases have been detected in Mbandaka, the provincial capital, which is located on a river and has transit links to other parts of the DRC, including Kinshasa.

Tests have confirmed 2 more Ebola infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's (DRC's) Equateur province outbreak, and both are patients from Mbandaka, the provincial capital, the country's multisector Ebola technical committee (CMRE) said today [Wed 8 Jul 2020] in an update.

The new cases lift the illness total in the country's 11th Ebola outbreak to 43. The CMRE also reported 1 more death, which occurred in the community in Mbandaka, a factor known to raise the risk of transmission. So far, 18 people have died from their infections. Health officials also noted that 8758 people in the outbreak area have been vaccinated with Merck's VSV-EBOV Ebola vaccine.

The outbreak began in early June [2020] in the same area where the DRC's 9th outbreak occurred in 2018, which resulted in 54 cases, 33 of them fatal.
