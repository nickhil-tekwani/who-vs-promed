[The Indian subcontinent has experienced HPAI outbreaks due to H5N1 virus infection in domestic poultry and other birds almost every year since the 1st report in 2006. Since November 2016, subtype H5N8 also was reported.

In Bangladesh, the seroprevalence in house crows is as high as in Anseriformes. House crows are omnivores often found scavenging for food wherever garbage is dumped, especially in heavily urbanized areas in Bangladesh. Already in 2011, Bangladeshi house crows were reported infected by HPAI H5N1. HPAI H5N1 viruses also have been isolated from (dead) crow species in other countries in Asia. - Mod.PMB
