A dangerous outbreak of drug resistant bacterial infection was traced to
contamination in flasks used to deliver tea to patients. Doctors in
Istanbul had been mystified as to how the _Acinetobacter_ strain was making
its way around hospital wards.
A visiting infection control team from Linz in Austria had looked at all
the usual potential sources -- such as poor hygiene among medical staff or
orderlies -- but found nothing. When they looked at the flasks used to
carry tea and other hot drinks, however, they found that more than half of
them carried significant numbers of the dangerous organism.
They found that rubber seals in the flasks had perished over time, making
them impossible to sterilize once contaminated. Liquid collected between
the inner and outer walls of the flask formed a reservoir for the
infection. Examination of 56 flasks in three hospitals found [that 26 were
riddled with potentially harmful bacteria.
This incident was presented to the European Society of Clinical
Microbiology and Infectious Disease in Istanbul on Tuesday. Other delegates
told the conference how they were experiencing problems with the same type
of bacteria, which now appears to have become resistant to most
antibiotics. Many said that problems with resistant bugs could often be
traced to the water supply in the hospital.

[_Acinetobacter_ sp. have been recognized as increasingly
antibiotic-resistant organisms capable of causing hospital acquired
infections. We have had prior reports of problems with this organism from
Turkey in 1997 (see ProMED-mail references cited above). The organism is a
nonfermentative Gram negative coccobacillus reported to cause pneumonia,
endocarditis, meningitis, and wound infections in hospital inpatients. _A.
baumannii_ is a species commonly isolated from humans. - Mod.ES
