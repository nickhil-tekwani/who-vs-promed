Following the recent posting on botulism associated with consumption of
whale blubber (Botulism, whale blubber, 2002 - USA (Alaska) 2003 0117.0142)
it is worth noting that large outbreaks of salmonellosis have been
documented following the ingestion of the flesh of beached and dead whales.
A total of 172 people in Japan developed gastroenteritis after ingesting
meat from a whale (_Hyperaodon rostratum_) that had been "floating on the
sea water in a sick and dying state." _Salmonella enteritidis_ was isolated
from the remaining whale meat as well as from feces of the patients (1).
An outbreak in the Eskimo community of Tununak resulted from the
consumption of uncooked skin and blubber sections from the tail and
flippers of a whale "which had been discovered lying on a beach at least a
week earlier." _Salmonella enteritidis_ was cultured from the whale meat
and from patients, and was responsible for illness in 105 people, including
93 of 99 people who ate whale meat (2).
In 1959, 400 people at Umanak, Greenland acquired gastroenteritis after
eating a dolphin that had died from accident or disease (3).
