Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks (1)
Outbreak location: Kraiburg a. Inn, Muhldorf am Inn, Bayern [Bavaria]
Started: 29 Sep 2021
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 56 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0 / 0

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The cow which was born on [23 Mar 2007] was slaughtered on [27 Sep 2021] without clinical signs of disease. As part of the German targeted bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance system the 14-year-old cow was tested at the regional BSE laboratory in Bavaria with positive result on [29 Sep 2021]. Animal health measures have been immediately taken by the local veterinary authority and a brainstem sample was sent to the NRL (Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute). Results from immunoblot tests at the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute confirmed the animal positive for atypical BSE of the L-type. The animal's carcass was destroyed. The identified animal did not enter food supply channels, and so at no time did it present any risk to human health. Epidemiological investigations are still ongoing.

Control measures applied in domestic: Ante and post-mortem inspections, official destruction of animal products, movement control inside the country, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, screening, surveillance within containment and or the protection zone, surveillance outside containment and or the protection zone, traceability, selective killing and disposal.

[Cases of atypical BSE do not impact the official BSE risk status of a country; therefore, this detection will not change the negligible risk status of Germany.

The following has been extracted from "Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) OIE Portal" at https://www.oie.int/en/animal-health-in-the-world/animal-diseases/bovine-spongiform-encephalopathy/#C.

"Atypical BSE refers to naturally and sporadically occurring forms, which are believed to occur in all cattle populations at a very low rate, and which have only been identified in older cattle when conducting intensive surveillance.

"In the early 2000s, atypical prions causing atypical BSE were identified as the result of enhanced surveillance for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. The number of cases of atypical BSE is negligible.

"Indeed, whilst to date, there is no evidence that atypical BSE is transmissible, recycling of the atypical BSE agent has not been ruled out and therefore measures to manage exposure risk in the feed chain continue to be recommended as a precautionary measure.

"BSE is an OIE-listed disease and must be reported to the OIE, as indicated in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. The occurrence of atypical BSE is not considered for the purpose of official BSE risk status recognition as it can spontaneously occur in any cattle population." - Mod.CRD
