Nearly 5000 wild ducks were killed, poisoned by north west Colombia farmers
who were willing to sell them for human use, reported environmental
authorities last Saturday.
Birds migrating from Canada died last Friday in a rural area in San Benito
Abad Municipality, Sucre Department, 450 kilometers north of Bogota, after
ingesting poison placed in water and food. In this region, which is located
near the Caribbean sea, duck meat is as valuable as fish, so it is legal to
hunt ducks, but using other methods.
"The authorities captured 2 unscrupulous persons who yesterday put rat
poison in one body of water in our region in order to catch migrating
birds, specifically ducks" said to journalist Mr Ignacio Hernandez, head of
Corpomojana environmental corporation.
Some of the ducks were incinerated, and meanwhile police authorities are
inspecting local markets in order to prevent commercialization of these
animals. Mr Hernandez pointed out that even though there were cases of
migrating bird poisoning in the past, this is the first time so many
animals have been killed.

[This article does not indicate what type of rat poison was used on the
birds. My guess is a type of anticoagulant. Some anticoagulants can produce
what is known as secondary or relay toxicosis. That is, the bird dies from
the toxicant, and any animal or human who ingests the carcass or parts of
the carcass may become intoxicated as well. Since we don't know which
toxicant was used, it is difficult to know if this phenomenon is likely to
occur. - Mod.TG]
