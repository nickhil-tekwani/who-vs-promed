To access the MMWR via the MMWR web page:
http://www.cdc.gov/
Go to: "Publications, Products, and Subscription Services," then
"Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR)" to find the MMWR.
-OR-
Via anonymous FTP:
ftp.cdc.gov in directory pub/Publications/mmwr/wk/mm4510.pdf
If you do not have access to either FTP or the WWW, you may retrieve the
MMWR via e-mail from the Majordomo list server. This process is much slower
and more complex than either anonymous FTP or the World Wide Web.
Copy the following script, and paste it into an e-mail message addressed
to lists@list.cdc.gov:
get mmwr mmwr.archive.960315
Majordomo will send the file uuencoded. Depending on your e-mail system,
some sites may have to process the received mail with a uudecode utility
to create an acceptable binary file readable by Acrobat. If the e-mail
system does not have uudecode, contact your e-mail administrator.
Uudecode software is available free of charge at many FTP sites on the
Internet.
If you need further instructions about Majordomo send an e-mail message to
lists@list.cdc.gov. The subject line should remain blank, and the body of
the message should read:
help
Majordomo will send you a detailed help file with further instructions
and commands.

A searchable index is now available for issues of MMWR dating from 1993 to
the present. Via the World Wide Web, access:

The address for the searchable index has changed. Please make a note of it.
