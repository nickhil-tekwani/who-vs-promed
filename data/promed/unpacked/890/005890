Pandemic activity is showing early signs of peaking in some parts of
North America, but is on the rise in several European countries as
well as those in Central and Eastern Asia, the World Health
Organization (WHO) reported today [13 Nov 2009].

In the United States, southern and southeastern states that were
among the 1st to report illness spikes at the end of the summer 2009
may have already seen a peak in cases, the WHO said in its weekly
update today [13 Nov 2009].

Meanwhile, pandemic activity has become more intense in Canada over
the past 3 weeks, with illness increases spread from west to east.
Health officials in British Columbia said yesterday [12 Nov 2009]
that flu activity might be leveling off in the southern and central
part of the province, according to a report today from the Metro
Vancouver newspaper.

The WHO reported that flu activity in Mexico has also been widespread
throughout the country since early September 2009, particularly in
the central and southern regions.

In Europe and Central Asia, the virus is spreading eastward, but
disease activity may be peaking in some areas that had early autumn
outbreaks such as Iceland, Ireland, and parts of the United Kingdom,
including Northern Ireland. England's chief medical officer, Liam
Donaldson, said yesterday [12 Nov 2009] that the country's number of
new flu cases fell by 1/4th last week, but he said it was too soon to
say the pandemic has peaked and said the decrease in illnesses might
be fueled by a school break, BBC News reported.

The WHO said today [13 Nov 2009] that its initial investigation into
a sharp rise in cases in the Ukraine found that the numbers of severe
cases were not out of line when compared with pandemic outbreaks in
other countries and do not portray any changes in pandemic H1N1
transmission or virulence. The WHO's European regional office said in
a statement yesterday [12 Nov 2009] that its investigators have
returned to Kiev where they had meetings with the country's prime
minister and president to discuss actions needed to slow the spread
of the virus and which groups to prioritize for vaccination. Though
the WHO investigators in the Ukraine are still working on their final
assessment, they said the country's health facilities are well
prepared to manage the surge of flu cases.

More than 99 percent of the viruses sub-typed in Europe are the
pandemic H1N1 strain, except in the Russian Federation, where 10
percent were seasonal H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes.

Meanwhile, some Western Asian and Middle Eastern countries are
reporting sharp increases over the past 3 weeks, including Israel and
Afghanistan. In Eastern Asia, Mongolia is reporting intense and
increasing flu activity, which is severely affecting the country's
healthcare system. Flu activity is increasing in China and Japan, but
flu-like illnesses seem to be leveling off in Hong Kong and on
Hokkaido, Japan's northern island.

Flu illness rates may have recently peaked in some Caribbean
countries, the WHO said, adding that most countries in tropical
regions of Central and South America report slowing flu activity.
Transmission is also declining in most parts of South and Southeast
Asia except for Nepal and Sri Lanka.

The only Southern Hemisphere location reporting unusual flu activity
is Argentina, where a cluster of cases has been detected in the
country's capital.

Three African countries recently reported their 1st confirmed
pandemic H1N1 cases: Somalia, Nigeria, and Burundi.

So far, at least 6260 confirmed deaths from the virus have been
reported to the WHO.
