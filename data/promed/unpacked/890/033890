There have been up to 30 suspected cases of seasonal typhoid fever in
Lebanon over the past 6 to 8 weeks, and more are expected, health
experts said. "Of these, only 11 have been confirmed, but all are
being closely monitored in hospital," said Assaad Khoury, a
department director in the Lebanese public health ministry.
Initial cases were confirmed by the WHO Early Warning and Response
System, a team of health experts set up for the prompt detection of
disease outbreaks. The majority of typhoid cases so far have been in
children aged 11 to 16.
Typhoid cases are reported every year in Lebanon with the onset of
both the rainy season (from October) and the melting of the snow in
spring (end of March to April).
"With the autumn rain, and with the melting of the snow in spring,
contaminated water from the sewers comes up to ground level," said
Khoury. "At present, there is nothing abnormal about the way in which
it is spreading."
Because of its relation to sewage-contaminated water, typhoid
infections have been heavily prevalent in rural, marginalized areas.
All confirmed cases so far have been detected in south Lebanon, the
southern suburbs of Beirut and in the eastern Beqaa region.

Typhoid has pounded Kimaghngwa VDC of Sankhuwasabha district, a
bordering VDC to China, which is some 50 miles away from the District
Headquarters, Khandbari.
The headmaster of a local Mimalaya Primary School, Laya Bhote, said
there is no stock of medicine in the Sub-Health post. Bhote said more
than 20 people have been seriously ill with typhoid. The disease
cluster began in mid-October 2006.
There are only a rural health worker, Pembha Bhote, and an assistant,
Chhobhi Bhote, in the Sub-Health Post. They said the patients leave
without treatment, as they have no knowledge of how to check the
patients nor knowledge of the medical care required to treat them.
