Bluetongue in Israel

(Date of previous outbreak of bluetongue in Israel reported to the OIE:
December 2001).

Extract from the monthly report of Israel for September 2003, received on 6
Nov 2003 from Dr Oded Nir, Director of Veterinary and Animal Health
Services, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Beit Dagan:

Location No. of outbreaks in September 2003
Gan-Hashomron, Hadera district 1

Total number of animals in the outbreak:

species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
ovi / 100 / 17 / 0 / 0 / 0

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department:

- The monthly report referred to above is a corrected version of the
original report submitted to the OIE Headquarters, in which bluetongue was
reported absent in September 2003.

- The monthly report of Israel for October 2003 reports the absence of any
new outbreaks of bluetongue.

[Bluetongue was diagnosed in Israel for the first time in 1950. Intensive
surveillance, in place since 1964, demonstrates that the disease occurs in
a clear seasonal pattern, clinically affecting only unvaccinated sheep of
susceptible European breeds and, with lesser severity, their crosses with
the local Awassi sheep. Throughout the period 1964-2002, there were only 5
years during when no cases were reported (1980, 1981, 1999, 2000 and 2002).
5 bluetongue virus (BTV) serotypes have been identified in Israel so far
(1st year of identification in brackets): BTV4 (1950), BTV10 (1965), BTV16
(1966), BTV6 (1972), and BTV2 (1973). Since 1973, no additional serotypes
have been added to the list. The most prevalent is BT4. A pentavalent,
live-attenuated vaccine produced in Onderstepoort (South Africa) is
currently in use on a very small scale (4000-5000 sheep vaccinated in each
of the recent 5 years).

The virus appears each year, from July to December, in all parts of the
country except the Southern Arava (arid) region. It has been speculated
that new introductions of infected vectors might occur every year,
not precluding the existence of an endemic circulation. The
geographical distribution of BTV has been investigated, based mainly on
serosurveillance in young sentinel cattle in various regions sampled in
June and December. This surveillance was operational between 1980 and 1995.

The incidence of clinical disease depends also upon human-related factors
such as vaccination rates and the presence of susceptible breeds;
therefore, the incidence of clinical cases in sheep is unrelated to the
prevalence of the virus itself in a given year. The number of clinical foci
varies from year to year, averaging 13-14 cases/year.

During the period 1968-1998, a total of 413 laboratory-confirmed outbreaks
were recorded. Observations during the years 1980-1985 showed a good
correlation between the BTV serotypes from cattle (serology), sheep
(isolations from clinical cases), and culicoides (isolation). - Mod.AS]
