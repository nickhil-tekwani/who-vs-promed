AIDS-like retrovirus threatens Australia's koalas with extinction
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) may be one of the world's cuter
critters, but that doesn't mean they have it easy. Not only have
koala populations become heavily fragmented due to habitat loss, they
face numerous threats that they never encountered before: household
cats and dogs frequently kill koalas; hundreds die every year after
being run over by cars and trucks; and now a deadly virus is
spreading to koalas throughout Australia.

The koala retrovirus, which infects and alters the animal's DNA, has
been linked to a variety of diseases and medical problems, including
leukemia, bone marrow failure, cancer and AIDS-like immune
deficiencies. First found in 2000, the retrovirus is already forcing
some smaller koala populations into extinction, says Jon Hanger,
director of research and ecological services at the Australian
Wildlife Hospital. Hanger was the 1st person to genetically sequence
the koala retrovirus after its discovery.

Hanger equates the koala retrovirus with the deadly devil facial
tumor disease (DFTD) devastating the world's Tasmanian devils
(Sarcophilus harrisii), which many fear may soon drive that species
into extinction. He has called for support akin to that given to help
protect the devils to stop the spread of the koala retrovirus.
"Twenty-two million dollars has been committed by government to
manage the contagious cancer afflicting Tasmanian devils. The koala
disease epidemic is just as devastating but we know little about it,"
Hanger recently told Brisbane's Courier-Mail.

Meanwhile, the retrovirus isn't the only illness affecting koala
populations. Up to 50 percent of Australia's koalas are infected with
chlamydiosis, a disease caused by the chlamydia bacterium, made all
the more deadly by the koala retrovirus, which can compromise the
animals' immune systems. In fact, one of Australia's most famous
koalas recently died of chlamydia: Sam, the koala who became an
Internet video sensation after she was rescued from a bushfire by
volunteer firefighter Dave Tree earlier this year, passed away on 5
Aug 2009, not from her fire-induced injuries but from chlamydia. (Sam
needed to be put to sleep because the infection had ravaged her
urinary and reproductive tracts beyond repair.)

Hanger, Tree and others are urging people to donate to Australian
Wildlife Hospital through its parent company, Wildlife Warriors
Worldwide (founded by television icons, the late Steve Irwin and his
wife Terri), to help fund efforts to protect koalas from this virus
before it is too late. Scientists at the Queensland University of
Technology are also working on a chlamydia vaccine, but say they need
to raise around 1.7 million AUD [1 575 293 USD] in order to get it
out in the next 2 years.

RE: Chlamydial infections
-------------------------
I have been following up on Chlamydia infection in all species for
quite some time now and I thought John Hanger's comment on retroviral
infection leading to a modified immune response and thus increased
susceptibility to Chlamydia infection with clinical disease very interesting.

From my experience, at least in cattle, it seems to be the other way
round: infection with Chlamydia (even subclinical) leads to immune
suppression so other infections can take hold more easily and cause
more and severe signs. Usually it seems Chlamydia are in balance with
their host, causing no obvious signs of disease but in times of
stress; i.e., parturition and start of lactation in dairy cattle they
can cause havoc. As in Koalas, one can detect Chlamydia in most
cattle, laying dormant and waiting for the chance to strike.

There are several herds in our region that are vaccinating cattle for
years now against Chlamydia and since then have no problems with the
"common" viral diseases like Rota/Corona virus or eye infections,
retentio secundinarium or downer cows after calving that don't
respond to the usual milk fever treatment. I attach a reference to a
paper dealing with subclinical mastitis/high somatic cell counts and
the Chlamydia vaccine trial. [Caroline Biesewnkamp-Uhe et al, 2007,
Therapeutic Chlamydophila abortus and C. pecorum vaccination
transiently reduces bovine mastitis associated with Chlamydophila
infection. Infection & Immunity, 75(2): 870-877 or:
<http://iai.asm.org/cgi/reprint/75/2/870>,
<http://iai.asm.org/cgi/content/full/75/2/870>] The only problem is
that you can't get rid of Chlamydia and you have to vaccinate cattle
at least every 4 months.


I think that the impact of Chlamydia on animal health is
underestimated, mainly due to the difficulties in diagnosis.

[The suggestion is that just as the koala retrovirus impacts on their
Chlamydia infections, it may also be that Chlamydia impact on other
pathogens, in the thread in question koala pathogens.

However I would remind members that this thread is on clamydiosis in
koalas, but as we engage with novel pathogens we can expect to
increasingly see novel interactions not suspected before. - Mod.MHJ]
