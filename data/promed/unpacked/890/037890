Between [23 and 25 Feb 2015], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 10 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Cases are listed by date of reporting, with the most recent case listed 1st.

Details of the cases are as follows:

1. A 56 year old male from Afif city developed symptoms on [22 Feb 2015] while admitted to hospital since [2 Feb 2015] due to unrelated medical conditions. On [17 Feb 2015], the patient was admitted in the same ICU as a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [23 Feb 2015] (case n. 36); however, he was not treated by the same health workers.

[The WHO confirmation reports are very helpful in filling in more information on cases that was not available at the time of the initial confirmation reports. While there were 10 cases reported on the Saudi MOH website during the period 23-25 Feb 2015, only 9 are reflected in the above WHO report. One of the cases -- the 84 year old male from Al Ayoun city (case no.2 in the WHO report above) -- could not be found in any of the MOH reports. The 10th case reported on the MOH website during this period is a 35 year old male from Hofuf (the largest city in the Al Ahsa region) who was reported to be in stable condition on 24 Feb 2015. Clarification of these reports would be greatly appreciated.

Of the 10 cases detailed in the above WHO report, 6 were either reported to have had direct contact with a known case or were known to be in the healthcare environment where another confirmed case had been.

According to the latest ECDC communicable disease threat report, as of 6 Mar 2015 there have been a total of 1079 cases of MERS-CoV reported by local health authorities worldwide, including 439 deaths (case fatality rate 41 per cent) (see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-07-mar-2015.pdf).

[3] Saudi Arabia, 3 Philippine HCWs - media report
Date: 6 Mar 2015
Source: Manila Standard Today [edited]
http://manilastandardtoday.com/2015/03/07/3-more-nurses-down-with-mers/


According to the Department of Foreign Affairs, 3 more Filipino health workers have been diagnosed with Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia, but they have been quarantined and are already undergoing treatment. "They were exposed to patients with MERS-CoV and they are all in isolation right now," DFA spokesman Charles Jose told reporters in a briefing on Friday [6 Mar 2015].

"Our embassy in Riyadh and consulate general in Jeddah continue to monitor the condition of new Filipino MERS cases," Jose said, noting that 10 Filipinos, mostly from Saudi, have died from MERS-CoV. Jose said the 1st to be diagnosed with MERS-CoV was a 56 year old Filipina nurse who was assigned to a hospital emergency room, but he declined to identify the nurse or the hospital where she was working. "She is now under isolation in the hospital's staff housing, while the 2nd is a respiratory technician, currently confined and undergoing medical tests," Jose said.

The 3rd Filipina nurse who contracted the deadly virus was assigned at the oncology section of a hospital. "They were diagnosed just recently. It was discovered in the early stage. The 3 OFWs [overseas foreign workers] are in isolation right now," Jose said. The DFA said they will get in touch with the families of the OFWs to inform them of any development, but visiting them would be prohibited in the meantime.

The Philippine Embassy in Riyadh and its consulate general in Jeddah will continue to monitor the condition of new Filipino MERS cases, Jose said. "Healthcare sector workers are advised to follow the infection prevention protocol in their hospital and to seek medical attention in case they experience any of the disease's symptoms," Jose said.

The DFA said there are hundreds of Filipino health workers employed in various hospitals across the Middle East, making them vulnerable to acquiring the virus. Jose said there is no travel restrictions to the Saudi Arabia , but advised Filipino workers in the Middle East to exercise vigilance and practice health precautions for their own protection.

Meanwhile, the MERS virus has killed 10 more people in Saudi Arabia over the past week, pushing the death toll above 400, as health officials broaden their campaign to halt its spread. Saudi Arabia is the country worst-hit by MERS-CoV.

The latest deaths occurred between [27 Feb 2015 and 5 Mar 2015], adding to a surge of cases that killed 30 people in February [2015] alone. Of those deaths, 6 were in Riyadh, health ministry data show.

A total of 936 people have been infected with MERS since it was 1st identified in the kingdom in 2012, and 402 of them have died.

A surge in MERS cases typically occurs around this time of year, when there are more juvenile camels circulating, Abdul Aziz bin Saeed, who heads the centre coordinating the health ministry's response to MERS, warned in early February [2015]. More than 20 countries have been affected by the virus but most cases have been linked to the Middle East.

[According to the media report, the number of Philippine expats working in the healthcare sector in Saudi Arabia is in the hundreds. This serves as a reminder that there is travel between the Middle East and other countries around the world, bringing with it the possibility of importations of cases of MERS-CoV. One of my colleagues raised the question: Can we really be sure that there haven't been other cases of MERS-CoV in returning overseas workers to resource-poor countries? A good question. Fortunately the number of generations of transmission that have been documented have been low to date, but recent WHO reports have highlighted some of the transmission chains in the healthcare environment showing they have not been negligible. - Mod.MPP]
