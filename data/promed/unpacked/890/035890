Following a request from Peter Young <YoungP@prose.dpi.qld.gov.au>
[Queensland Agricultural Biotechnology Centre Gehrmann Laboratories,
Research Road, The University of Queensland, St Lucia 4072, Australia for
background on the current molecular identification and typing of FMDv, I
contacted Alex Donaldson, D/Pirbright Laboratory, UK, for enlightenment.
His reply follows, with my thanks:
Date: Friday, May 19, 2000 2:31AM
From: Alex.Donaldson@bbsrc.ac.uk

In response to Peter Young's enquiry I can advise that the type O FMD
viruses which caused the outbreaks in Japan and Korea this year were
analysed by comparing the sequences of part of the 1D (VP1) gene of the
isolates with the sequences of reference strains of type O FMD virus held
in a data bank here at the OIE/FAO World Reference Laboratory for FMD,
Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright.

The methods for obtaining the sequences and their computer analysis have
been described by Knowles, Ansell and Samuel (Report of the Session of the
Research Group of the Standing Technical Committee of the European
Commission for the Control of FMD, Aldershot, UK 14-18 September pp41-48,
FAO, Rome) and by Samuel, Knowles and Mackay (Epidemiology and Infection
Vol 122, 529-538, 1999).
