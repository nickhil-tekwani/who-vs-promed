Toddler saved from bird flu; 162nd case
---------------------------------------
A medical team at RSUD Arifin Achmad public hospital in Pekanbaru,
Riau, has succeeded in saving the life of a 4-year-old child from bird
flu [avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection]. Now the hospital is
currently struggling to save another H5N1 suspect, a 17-year-old boy,
from the life-threatening condition.

Team coordinator Azizman Saad said that the child was declared bird
flu positive based on the results of laboratory tests by the Health
Ministry's Research and Development Agency last week. "But the patient
had already been cured from the disease even before we received the
laboratory test result," Azizman told The Jakarta Post, on Sunday [10
Jan 2010]. Azizman said the child had recovered and was now in a
normal condition having been declared clinically healthy since her
body temperature as well as other key indicators including blood count
and white cell count were now back to normal. "She can communicate
normally, too," he said.

Previously, according to Azizman, the only daughter of an oil palm
farmer and his wife of Sungai Lalak subdistrict, Sungai Lalak
district, Indragiri Hulu regency, had suffered from a high fever of up
to 40 deg Celsius [104 deg F] and had experienced significant
respiratory problems. She had to be isolated as the flu-like symptoms
occurred after she had physical contact with a dead chicken in her
back yard. "The team of doctors actually had allowed her to go home.
But, as she has [since then] been declared bird flu positive, this was
cancelled," Azizman said. He added that the patient, however, had been
moved from the isolation room to the ordinary ward just for
observation purposes. She no longer needed help from a respiratory
device and has been allowed to have porridge and warm tea.

With the child's recovery, Azizman said, there were so far a total of
3 patients that were probably saved from bird flu since the disease
reached the province in 2005. Of the 2 previous cases of recovery from
bird flu, one was from Siak and the other was from Pekanbaru. 6 other
bird flu positive patients had unfortunately died during the same
period. "The 3 [who were saved] were cured because of quick and
correct treatment" he said.

Meanwhile, he said, the 17-year-old youth's condition was getting
worse. He is currently being treated in an isolation room. The student
of a high school in Painan, West Sumatra, was declared a bird flu
suspect because he has a fever with a temperature of up to 37.5 deg
Celsius [99.5 deg F] and respiratory problems. He is taking 60 breaths
a minute, while a healthy person normally takes between 16 and 20
breaths per minute. His blood count and white cell count levels are
very low, 8000 and 5000 while the normal levels are 100 000 and 10 000
respectively. "A family member said he lost consciousness on Friday [8
Jan 2010] after experiencing high fever, respiratory difficulties and
diarrhea," he said.

He added that the youth was referred to the RSUD Arifin Achmad public
hospital the following day after being treated previously at a private
hospital in Pekanbaru. "He is still in a coma and survives only with
the help of a ventilator. We regret that the patient was only brought
here when his condition was already so critical," Azizman said.
Azizman also said that the provincial Health Agency has sent the
samples of the patient's blood and phlegm for a laboratory test to the
Health Ministry's Research and Development Agency in Jakarta and was
now awaiting the results. "We have not yet any knowledge of a history
of contact with poultry as he normally stays in West Sumatra and is
only in Pekanbaru for the school holidays. "His family reported that
there were no poultry in their neighborhood," he added.
