In addition, 2 patients earlier reported from Jiangsu province died.

To date, a total of 126 laboratory confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus including 24 deaths have been reported to WHO. Contacts of the confirmed cases are being closely monitored. The authorities in the affected locations continue to implement prevention and control measures. Investigations into the possible sources of infection and reservoirs of the virus are ongoing. Until the source of infection has been identified and controlled, it is expected that there will be further cases of human infection with the virus. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human to human transmission.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it recommend that any travel or trade restrictions be applied.

[The case number continues to rise and is now beginning to involve provinces further away from the eastern coastal provinces. However, there has been no change in the general characteristics of the outbreak; that is, sporadic cases of severe illness manly involving elderly males, a few family clusters, but no confirmation of human to human transmission. No unequivocal identification of an animal source. The current case number is uncertain since now only official weekly reports are being released. - Mod.CP
