The Finnish Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Sirkka-Liisa Anttila
is considering measures to upgrade Salmonella enforcement and
legislation on animal feed in the light of the recent outbreak of
salmonella originating from the Raisio Feed plant, according to
Helsingin Sanomat.

The law on animal feed could be amended so that all soybean products
imported for use in chicken and pig feed should be processed in such
a way that they are clean of salmonella already before getting into
production. Much of the soybean used as a source of protein in the
feed is contaminated by salmonella. Even if the factory area is
thoroughly cleaned, salmonella is difficult to eradicate.

Finland is classified as a salmonella-free area in the European
Union, and the recent outbreak does not change this, says Maria
Teirikko of the Finnish Food Safety Authority (EVIRA). Teirikko
stated that there have been no breaches of safety regulations at
Raisio Feed that officials would need to react to.

Salmonella spread to a number of chicken and pig farms by the use of
infected feed. So far, the salmonella infection has been detected in
31 egg farms and 10 pork farms. The contamination led to slaughtering
at the infected farms, and the facilities themselves are being
disinfected.

The infected feed was manufactured on production line 7 at Raisio
Feed, which produces about 2 percent of all feed used in Finland.
Matti Aho, a senior official at the Ministry of Agriculture and
Forestry, says that salmonella is eliminated if the feed is heated
sufficiently during production. At the Raisio plant, the temperature
was probably not raised high enough.

Raisio CEO Matti Rihko says that the constant pressure caused by the
risk of salmonella applies to the entire animal feed industry. "We
perform twice as many salmonella tests as are required."

[According to Helsingin Sanomat, the current infection has not spread
to humans, but it did cause extensive damage at egg and pig farms.
