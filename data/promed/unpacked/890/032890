Canada: Antigenic Identity of Influenza Virus Isolated in Edmonton
--------------------------------------------------
4 of the 5 strains of influenza virus isolated in the Edmonton site of the
Alberta Provincial Laboratory that were sent to the National Microbiology
Laboratory in Winnipeg for typing have come back as A/Panama/2007/99-like.
A/Panama/2007/99-like is the H3N2 component of the 2002/2003 vaccine. Only
one isolate was very difficult to grow to the high titres required for the
hemagglutination-inhibition test. The H3N2 typing in that strain was
performed by molecular assay, and it appears to be A/Panama/2007/99-like.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Shafran for this prompt response to the request for
information on the antigenic sphericity of the influenza virus responsible
for the outbreak in Western Canada. It is reassuring to learn that the
virus isolates recovered in Edmonton do not differ significantly from the
influenza A (H3N2) virus component of the current vaccine. - Mod.CP]
