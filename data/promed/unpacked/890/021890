The Risk of the Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome after Antibiotic Treatment of
_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 Infections. Craig S. Wong, Srdjan Jelacic,
Rebecca L. Habeeb, Sandra L. Watkins, Phillip I. Tarr
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
Background. Children with gastrointestinal infections caused by
_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 are at risk for the hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
Whether antibiotics alter this risk is unknown.
Methods. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 71 children younger
than 10 years of age who had diarrhea caused by _E. coli_ O157:H7 to assess
whether antibiotic treatment in these children affects the risk of the
hemolytic-uremic syndrome and to assess the influence of confounding
factors on this outcome. Estimates of relative risks were adjusted for
possible confounding effects with the use of logistic-regression analysis.
Results. Among the 71 children, 9 (13 percent) received antibiotics and the
hemolytic-uremic syndrome developed in 10 (14 percent). Five of these 10
children had received antibiotics. Factors significantly associated with
the hemolytic-uremic syndrome were a higher initial white-cell count
(relative risk, 1.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 1.5),
evaluation with stool culture soon after the onset of illness (relative
risk, 0.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.8), and treatment with
antibiotics (relative risk, 14.3; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to
70.7). The clinical and laboratory characteristics of the 9 children who
received antibiotics and the 62 who did not receive antibiotics were
similar. In a multivariate analysis that was adjusted for the initial
white-cell count and the day of illness on which stool was obtained for
culture, antibiotic administration remained a risk factor for the
development of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (relative risk, 17.3; 95
percent confidence interval, 2.2 to 137).
Conclusions. Antibiotic treatment of children with _E. coli_ O157:H7
infection increases the risk of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
