From: Rashid Chotani <rchotani@jhmi.edu>

Wilde and colleagues in a study published in JAMA 1999;28:908-913, looked
at the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in healthy, young healthcare
workers (HCW), and reported a vaccine efficacy of 88% for influenza A and
89% for influenza B. This study clearly demonstrates that vaccine not only
prevents infections but may reduce commutative days of reported febrile
respiratory illness as well as absenteeism.
Another study by Potter in J. Infect. Dis. 1997;175(1):1-6, demonstrated
that vaccination of HCW was associated with reductions in total patient
mortality (17% to 10%) and in influenza-like illness . The study also
concluded that vaccinating patients was not associated with significant
effects on mortality.
Results from these studies support recommendations for vaccination against
influenza of HCW in acute care setting as well as long-term geriatric care.
Although, the Potter study demonstrated that vaccination of elderly
long-term-care patients may not be clinically worthwhile, it did show that
there was a tendency for the incidence to be the lowest in sites where both
the HCW and patients were offered vaccine.
Thus, in healthcare settings all workers and high risk patients (people
older than 65 years, residents of nursing homes and chronic care
facilities, persons with chronic pulmonary or cardiac conditions, and
persons with diabetes mellitus) should be immunized against influenza at
the appropriate time. Successful programs can be highly cost effective as
they can reduce the risk of HCW getting the infection, prevent transmission
from HCW to high-risk patients, thus improving patient-care and reducing
HCW absenteeism.

[We sent the above to Dr. David Morens for comment, and his response
appears below. -Mod.ES
There is little question that (excepting rare individuals with
contraindications, primarily allergic) ALL patients in long term care
facilities, and ALL health care providers who care for them, including
administrative personnel who enter the wards and facilities, should be
vaccinated annually against influenza viruses. That said, it seems that
even these precautions are frequently not sufficient to prevent nursing
home outbreaks with fatalities. For one thing, visitors to such patients
are not easily screened, and have been shown to introduce influenza viruses
that result in outbreaks. Moreover, in the U.S., physicians and
(especially) nurses and nurse aides are notoriously resistant to
vaccination, meaning that for all practical purposes it is nearly
impossible to institute health care worker herd immunity. Fourth, the
current vaccines are highly imperfect in middle aged adults and much worse
in the elderly, particularly the institutionalized elderly and the "old
old" (i.e., those over 80 or 85). Even under the best of circumstances,
such as 100% vaccination, many patients will be unprotected, and herd
immunity (patients plus staff) may be insufficient. And influenza may be
spread on the hands of staff or on fomites, against which vaccination may
be of little help.
Dr. Chotani notes that vaccinating the elderly in institutions "may not be
worthwhile". That's a pessimistic view, though one that's difficult to
disprove. Since vaccines are safe and relatively inexpensive in developed
nations, and may hopefully reduce mortality even if they do not prevent
infection, vaccination must still be recommended. Yet, as noted in an
earlier posting, there is a great need, I would say an urgent need, to get
better data on the epidemiology and consequences of influenza in long term
care settings, and to thoughtfully reconsider influenza prevention policy,
including vaccine policy. Incidentally, we have noted the frequency with
which nursing home outbreaks are sentinel events in many communities. That
is, nursing home outbreaks are frequently the first detected instances of
community transmission, an observation that seems to hold over the past
several decades.
We (Morens & Rash, Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol 1995;16:275-280)
recommended to the Hawaii Department of Health 10 years ago that it
consider sentinel surveillance for febrile illnesses in nursing homes, as a
way of detecting, and providing rapid response for, community transmission,
and of controlling such outbreaks (influenza, RSV, etc.) quickly. I
believe the State, which has been a sort of bellwether for influenza
nationally, acted upon this recommendation, although I do not have
follow-up data.
