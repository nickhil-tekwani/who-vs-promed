Re: Avian influenza (125): Germany (Thuringia), domestic goose, confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Culling of all domestic birds within a 3-km (2-mile) radius of the
remote town of Wickersdorf, where the H5N1-infected goose died, began
late Friday [6 Jul 2007], the Thuringian state health ministry said."
"The subsequent control and eradication measures are prescribed by EU
legislation."
EU legislation does not require that all domestic birds within a 3-km
radius be culled, only that this be the surveillance zone. It remains
questionable whether area-culling policies such as these are effective.
There is evidence from Turkey that they may be counterproductive,
leading to resistance by keepers who do not perceive that their birds
are at higher risk and may also delay reporting because owners fear
the consequences for their neighbours.
As an indication that such policies are not necessarily required,
Turkey had an outbreak of 230 cases over 3 months in 2006, affecting
most of the country in which something like 11 000 backyard poultry
were culled per outbreak. In 2007, they had an outbreak of 18 cases
over a period of one month in a limited area of the country in which
1700 birds were culled per outbreak.
It may be that there are particular circumstances in this case that,
based on careful on-the-ground risk assessment by veterinarians
require such widespread culling. But it is vital that we do not fall
into the situation of this becoming seen as always necessary. It is
not and is not mandated by any EU regulation.

[Dr Honhold's valid observation is appreciated; information on the
considerations leading to the decision to cull all domestic fowl
within a 3-km zone around the focus (see also item 2) will be educative.

[2] Germany (Thuringia): domestic goose

An outbreak of deadly H5N1 bird flu in German poultry appeared
confined to a single goose, animal health officials said Sunday [8
Jul 2007], after quick-fire tests on 1200 birds killed in a cull. The
goose was found last Monday [2 Jul 2007] in the yard of a commune for
intellectually handicapped people in the sleepy German hill village
of Wickersdorf.
All poultry within a radius of 13 [sic; should read 3] km were killed
by injection by Saturday [7 Jul 2007], with police and veterinarians
in white protective clothing going door-to-door in search of birds.
Amateur poultry breeders, who said their life's work been ruined by
the cull, vented fury at the handicapped group, which had only moved
to the village 4 weeks ago and offered animal care as a form of therapy.
The H5N1 strain of avian influenza is potentially fatal to people and
scientists fear it may mutate into a form that can be communicated
from human to human.
The outbreak began in Germany 2 weeks ago with wild swans and grebes
dying on lakes. Germany had only had one outbreak of H5N1 in domestic
poultry before, near Leipzig in 2006.
Thomas Schulz, spokesman for the state health ministry of Thuringia,
said in Eisenach that tissue tests of the hundreds of culled ducks,
geese, and hens had found no more H5N1. The remains were being
incinerated. "The complete tests will take until Wednesday [11 Jul
2007], but so far there is no evidence of a wider outbreak," he said.
All the handicapped people and their care providers had been checked
as well and none had been infected.
Schulz said officials understood the handicapped folk were devastated
at losing their other 3 geese and 5 ducks from the commune's pond,
but the cull was unavoidable.
In the remote hills of central Germany, amateur breeders of the
Brakel, an ancient European breed of chicken, were dazed and angry
after being woken in the night and seeing their flocks destroyed.
"It's all the fault of these newcomers," grumbled one breeder in
nearby Volkmannsdorf, who lost all his hens. Another man who has bred
the hens for 46 years, said bitterly: "Our pedigree silver Brakel won
awards in the national shows. Never again. I'm too old now to start
all over from scratch."

German authorities culled about 1200 farm and pet birds over the
weekend [2-8 Jul 2007], after a pet goose tested positive for the
lethal strain of bird flu, a government spokesman said on Monday [9 Jul 2007].
The slaughtering programme had now been completed in an exclusion
zone around Wickersdorf in Thueringen in east Germany, a Thueringen
state government spokesman said.
A pet goose in a home for mentally handicapped people had tested
positive for the lethal H5N1 strain of bird flu and all farm and pet
birds in a 3-km (2 mi) exclusion zone were culled as a precautionary
measure over the weekend, he said. The affected goose had been able
to run around freely and contact with wild birds was suspected as
being the cause, he added. Investigations into the infection were continuing.
Thueringen had re-introduced a lock-up order for farm poultry, which
must be kept indoors in areas of high-risk contact with wild birds,
such as in farms near lakes and rivers.
The east German state government of Saxony also said 2 more wild
swans in its area had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu.
The latest cases in Saxony and Thueringen mean H5N1 bird flu has been
confirmed in a total of 43 wild birds plus the pet goose in Germany
since 24 Jun [2007], a spokeswoman for the Friedrich-Loeffler
national animal diseases institute said on Monday [9 Jul 2007].
These were the 1st German cases in 10 months. They were all reported
in east and south Germany, and bird flu has not been discovered in farm birds.
Japan said it was banning imports of day-old chicks from Germany
following the bird flu case in the pet goose.
On 5 Jul [2007], H5N1 bird flu was also confirmed in 3 wild swans in France.
Last year [2006], some 13 European Union member states had confirmed
cases of bird flu -- Germany, Austria, Denmark, Italy, Greece,
Britain, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden,
France, and Hungary.
Bird flu has been spreading across Southeast Asia, killing 2 people
in Viet Nam last month [June 2007], the 1st deaths there since 2005.
Globally, the H5N1 virus has killed nearly 200 people out of over 300
known cases, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO). None
of the victims were from Europe.

A group of H5N1-infected ducks has brought the bird flu back to Viet
Nam's Southern-most province of Ca Mau, said the Animal Health
Department Saturday [7 Jul 2007].
The outbreak in Dam Doi District's Tan Trung commune wiped Ca Mau's
name off the list of bird flu-free provinces.
Currently, there are 9 other northern provinces plagued by the avian
virus: Nghe An, Hai Phong, Bac Giang, Ninh Binh, Vinh Phuc, Quang
Nam, Thai Binh, Ha Tinh, and Quang Ninh.
Last week [2-8 Jul 2007], the Veterinary Department announced that
1130 chickens and ducks had contracted the flu in Thai Binh and Nghe
An provinces.
Since the beginning of the year, 153.5 million fowls have undergone a
mass national vaccination throughout the country.

We have recently received from a subscriber, the following query:
"I was surprised to understand that in Viet Nam homologous H5N1
vaccines are being used when the situation is endemic. Can you help
me find the info I'm missing or misunderstanding?"
Confirmation or otherwise, and any available additional information
on the AI vaccines currently applied in Viet Nam will be welcomed.
