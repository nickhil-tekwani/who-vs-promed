My earlier comment on this disease requires clarification.
I erred in stating that it was not known whether Potato yellow
deforming virus [PYDV] could infect potato naturally.
We now know after over 20 years have passed that the original isolate
of PYDV was recorded in the 1980s in southern Brazil. Subsequently,
it was determined that PYDV and Tomato yellow vein streak virus
(ToYVSV) were one and the same virus, with ToYVSV as the official
viral acronym.
About 20 percent of young tomato plants showed virus symptoms. Tomato
is an important crop in Europe, where production systems are
extremely intensive, and yields can be very high (up to 700 tons/ha).
The virus vector [whitefly] (_Bemisa tabaci_) is present in the region of the
European & Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO). The disease
appears, so far, to be limited in Brazil, but data is lacking about its extent
and severity. ToYVSV infects both tomato and potato crops in Brazil.
