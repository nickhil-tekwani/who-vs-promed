England and Wales: Hospitals in Powys and Shropshire Affected
--------------------------------------------------
Outbreaks of a highly contagious viral infection have forced 3 hospitals in
Wales to close wards to patient admissions and restrict visitors, health
chiefs revealed last night.
In Powys, more than 50 patients and staff have been struck down by
[suspected norovirus] infection, which causes diarrhoea and vomiting.
Visitors have been advised to stay away from the Victoria Memorial Hospital
in Welshpool and Llandrindod Wells and Machynlleth cottage hospitals until
further notice. The hospitals' 3 admission wards were closed in a bid to
halt the spread of the virus, which has affected hundreds across Wales.
In Welshpool, 14 patients and 6 staff have gone down with the infection,
while in Llandrindod Wells 12 patients and 19 staff have caught the virus.
It is unclear how many have been affected in Machynlleth.
The hospital wards will require "deep cleaning," which is normal procedure,
said a Powys Health Care NHS Trust spokesman.
The manager of Victoria Memorial Hospital and Newtown County Infirmary,
Chris Fenwick, said the virus had led to the closure of the Maldwyn ward to
new admissions at Welshpool. She added that the outbreak had been difficult
to control because of the wide variety of symptoms presented by it, but
hoped the ward, which treats mainly elderly people, would be open for new
admissions by the end of the week.
2 hospitals nearby in Shropshire could be the cause of the problem in
Welshpool. Both the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and the Princess Royal
Hospital in Telford have both been [affected] by the virus. Ms Fenwick said
that:"It is possible that the virus could have been transferred from
Shrewsbury, but we are not certain about that. The bug could have been
brought in by a member of staff or a visitor, we don't know.

are on the wane. On the other hand, a more likely explanation may be
reporter fatigue. - Mod.CP]
