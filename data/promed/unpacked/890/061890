The Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) is reporting that a 2-year-old Andalusian mixed breed mare in Grandview [Yakima County] is the 1st horse in Washington to contract West Nile virus this year [2016]. The horse was not vaccinated for the disease and is showing neurologic signs of the illness including stumbling and difficulties eating.

The Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Pullman, operated by Washington State University, reported the positive test results to WSDA's State Veterinarian's Office [Fri 22 Jul 2016].

Washington had 36 confirmed cases of horses with West Nile virus last year [2015], leading the nation with nearly 17 percent of confirmed equine cases. And this year [2016], mosquitoes testing positive for West Nile virus have been trapped in Adams, Benton, Grant, Franklin, and Yakima counties.

"It's never too late to vaccinate your horse for West Nile virus," said WSDA field veterinarian Dr Thomas Gilliom. "We've had cooler days but when hot summer days return the risks of mosquito bites will increase."

West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes that have fed on infected birds. The disease sickens people, horses, birds, and other animals, but it does not spread directly from horses to people or other animals.

The disease is fatal to horses in about 1/3 of the cases in which clinical signs are apparent, although most horses do not become ill and show no signs. Horses that do become ill can appear to be displaying loss of coordination, loss of appetite, confusion, fever, stiffness, and muscle weakness, particularly in their hindquarters.

Spring is the best time to vaccinate horses against West Nile virus or obtain an annual booster shot. However, horses may still benefit from 1st-time vaccinations or an annual booster shot.

Besides vaccination, horse owners can take action to limit horse exposure to mosquitoes. For example, reduce or eliminate sources of stagnant or standing water, stable horses during peak mosquito periods (at dawn and dusk), use equine-approved mosquito repellants, place fans inside barns or stalls to maintain air movement, and avoid using incandescent bulbs inside stables at night.

Veterinarians who learn of potential West Nile virus cases in horses or other animals should contact the State Veterinarian's Office at (360) 902-1878.

Visit the websites of the state Department of Agriculture, Department of Health, or the US Department of Agriculture for more information. Last year [2015], the USDA reported 225 equine cases involving West Nile virus nationwide.

Although WNV became an endemic disease in the United States many years ago, it is sad that animals suffer and may end up dead because a vaccine was not given. Prevention is a simple vaccine.

West Nile virus (WNV) is the leading cause of arbovirus encephalitis in horses and humans in the United States. Since 1999, over 25 000 cases of WNV encephalitis have been reported in US horses. Horses represent 96.9 percent of all reported non-human mammalian cases of WNV disease.

This virus has been identified in all of the continental United States, most of Canada and Mexico. Several Central and South American countries have also identified WNV within their borders. The virus is transmitted from avian reservoir hosts by mosquitoes (and infrequently by other bloodsucking insects) to horses, humans, and a number of other mammals. West Nile virus is transmitted by many different mosquito species and this varies geographically. The virus and mosquito host interactions result in regional change in virulence of the virus and no prediction can be made regarding future trends in local activity of the viruses. Horses and humans are considered to be dead-end hosts for WNV; the virus is not directly contagious from horse to horse or horse to human. Indirect transmission via mosquitoes from infected horses is highly unlikely as these horses do not circulate a significant amount of virus in their blood.

The case fatality rate for horses exhibiting clinical signs of WNV infection is approximately 33 percent. Data have supported that 40 percent of horses that survive the acute illness caused by WNV still exhibit residual effects, such as gait and behavioral abnormalities, 6-months post-diagnosis. Thus vaccination for West Nile virus is recommended as a core vaccine and is an essential standard of care for all horses in North America.

There are 3 challenge models that have been used to license currently available vaccines. The mosquito and needle challenge were the 2 models used in early studies. These challenge models result in 90 percent of non vaccinated control horses developing viremia, while only 10 percent of these horses demonstrated clinical disease. More recently, the intrathecal (infection in the atlanto-occipital space) challenge model has been employed. In this model, 70 to 90 percent of non vaccinated control horses become viremic and 90 to 100 percent develop grave signs of encephalomyelitis.

West Nile virus vaccines are licensed either as 1) an aid in prevention of viremia; 2) an aid in reduction of viremia, encephalitis, and clinical disease; 3) an aid in prevention of disease, viremia, and encephalitis; or 4) an aid in prevention of viremia and mortality, and an aid in reduction of severity of clinical disease.

Vaccines
--------
There are 4 USDA licensed vaccines currently available (2 are inactivated whole WNV vaccines; one is a non-replicating live canary pox recombinant vector vaccine, and one is an inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine):

Inactivated whole virus vaccines with an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 3 to 6 weeks apart followed by a 12-month revaccination interval. These products are labeled as an aid in prevention of viremia or as an aid in prevention of viremia and mortality and an aid in reduction of severity of clinical disease.

Recombinant canary pox vaccine with protective antigens expressed in a vaccine strain canary pox vector which does not replicate in the horse. The vaccine contains an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 4 to 6 weeks apart, followed by a 12 month revaccination interval. The product is labeled as an aid in prevention of disease, viremia, and encephalitis.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine with protective antigens expressed in a vaccine strain yellow fever virus vector and contains an adjuvant. Label instructions call for a primary vaccination series of 2 intramuscular injections administered 3 to 4 weeks apart followed by a 12 month revaccination interval. This product is labeled as an aid in reduction of disease, encephalitis and viremia.

All of the current WNV vaccine products carry 1 year duration of immunity, with challenge, consistent with their respective label claims.

Vaccination schedules
---------------------
Adult horses previously vaccinated: Vaccinate annually in the spring, prior to the onset of the insect vector season.

For animals at high risk or with limited immunity, more frequent vaccination or appropriately timed revaccination is recommended in order to induce protective immunity during periods of likely exposure. For instance, juvenile horses (younger than 5 years of age) appear to be more susceptible than adult horses that have likely been vaccinated and/or had subclinical exposure. Geriatric horses (older than 15 years of age) have been demonstrated to have enhanced susceptibility to WNV disease. Therefore, more frequent vaccination may be recommended to meet the vaccination needs of these horses.

Booster vaccinations are warranted according to local disease or exposure risk. However, more frequent vaccination may be indicated with any of these products depending on risk assessment.

Adult horses previously unvaccinated or having unknown vaccinal history:
Inactivated whole virus vaccine: a primary series of 2 doses is administered to naïve horses. A 4 to 6 week interval between doses is recommended. The label recommended revaccination interval is 12 months.

Recombinant canary pox vector vaccine: a primary series of 2 doses is administered to naïve horses with a 4 to 6 week interval between doses. The label recommended revaccination interval is 12 months.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine: a primary series of 2 doses is administered to naïve horses. A 3 to 4 week interval between doses is recommended. The label recommended revaccination interval is 12 months.

Pregnant mares:
Limited studies have been performed that examine vaccinal protection against WNV disease in pregnant mares. While none of the licensed vaccines are specifically labeled for administration to pregnant mares at this time, practitioners have vaccinated pregnant mares due to the risk of natural infection. It is an accepted practice by many veterinarians to administer WNV vaccines to pregnant mares as the risk of adverse consequences of WNV infection outweighs any reported adverse effects of use of vaccine.

Pregnant mare previously vaccinated:
Vaccinate at 4 to 6 weeks before foaling.

Pregnant mares previously unvaccinated:
Initiate a primary vaccination series (see adult horses previously unvaccinated) immediately. Limited antibody response was demonstrated in pregnant mares vaccinated for the 1st time with the originally licensed inactivated, whole virus vaccine. It is unknown if this is true for the other products. Vaccination of naïve mares while open is a preferred strategy.

Foals:
Limited studies have been performed examining maternal antibody inference and inhibition of protection against WNV disease. The only data currently available is for the originally licensed, inactivated whole virus product in which foals were demonstrated to produce antibody in response to vaccination despite the presence of maternal antibody. No studies have been performed evaluating protection from disease in foals vaccinated in the face of maternal immunity.

Foals of vaccinated mares:
Inactivated whole virus vaccines: administer a primary 3-dose series beginning at 4-6 months of age. A 4 to 6 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses is recommended. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.
Data indicate that maternal antibodies do not interfere with the originally licensed, inactivated whole virus vaccine; however protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with these products if risk assessment warrants.

Recombinant canary pox vector vaccine: administration of a 3-dose primary vaccination series beginning at 4 to 6 months of age. There should be a 4 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.
There are no data for the recombinant canary pox vector vaccine regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine: administration of a 3-dose primary vaccination series beginning at 4-6 months of age. There should be a 4 week interval between the 1st and 2nd doses. The 3rd dose should be administered at 10 to 12 months of age prior to the onset of the next mosquito season.
There are no data for the inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Foals of unvaccinated mares:
The primary series of vaccinations should be initiated at 3 to 4 months of age and, where possible, be completed prior to the onset of the high-risk insect vector season.

Inactivated whole virus vaccines: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day interval between the second and third doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the second and third doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.
Data indicate that maternal antibodies do not interfere with the originally licensed product; however protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with these products if risk assessment warrants.

Recombinant canary pox vaccine: administer a primary series of 3-doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.
There are no data for this product regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Inactivated flavivirus chimera vaccine: administer a primary series of 3 doses with a 30-day interval between the 1st and 2nd doses and a 60-day interval between the 2nd and 3rd doses. If the primary series is initiated during the mosquito vector season, an interval of 3 to 4 weeks between the 2nd and 3rd doses is preferable to the above described interval of 8 weeks.
There are no data for this product regarding maternal antibody interference. Protection from clinical disease has not been provocatively tested in foals less than 6 months of age. Animals may be vaccinated more frequently with this product if risk assessment warrants.

Horses having been naturally infected and recovered:
Recovered horses likely develop life-long immunity, but this has not been confirmed. Consider revaccination if the immune status of the animal changes the risk for susceptibility to infection or at the recommendation of the attending veterinarian. Examples of these conditions would include the long term use of corticosteroids and pituitary adenoma.
