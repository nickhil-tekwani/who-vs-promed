A week ago [week of Sun 5 Nov 2017], the health alert was issued by the Ministry of Health for the regions of La Araucanía, Los Ríos and Los Lagos, due to an epidemic outbreak of Q fever, an infectious disease that is transmitted to humans by animals such as cows, sheep and goats . To date there are already 59 suspect cases and 3 confirmed cases in Osorno, of which 82 percent are livestock workers. Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, and gastrointestinal and respiratory discomfort. While there have been no reports of deaths, 18 patients have required hospitalization for pneumonia and 3 of them were connected to mechanical ventilation.

In the zone, authorities and productive unions assure that they have increased the preventive measures. "The contact with the bacterium occurs mainly in the management of the partuition of a cow or a sheep. Shelter measures are always taken, such as the use of gloves, but now with the aim of reducing or avoiding the maximum possible contact, additional measures are being taken," explained Eduardo Schwerter, president of Agrollanquihue, association of agricultural entrepreneurs.

One of these measures is the frequent disinfection of the bibs and the elements used during these processes. This is in addition to other safeguards that the sanitary authority had dictated, such as the restriction of the movement of animals from farms with an active outbreak, the recommendation of not consuming unpasteurized milk and the restriction of blood donations. According to Schwerter, the disease has existed for years in the country, however, until now it did not affect people. "It is a situation that is in a stage of low incidence, but we are interested in being studied to the maximum, to transmit peace of mind to workers and consumers," he said, adding that they are in coordination with the Ministries of Health and Agriculture and the Mutual de Seguridad .

For its part, the head of Prevention of the Hospital, Laura Moratilla, recalled that take "routine samples" of the ICU and operating rooms, as well as isolation rooms and other areas to rule out dangers.

[La Araucania is the 3rd region of Chile to be reported to be involved in the outbreak. These 3 regions are adjacent to one another and can be seen on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Chile. The outbreak seems to be centered on Osorno, part of the Los Lagos region, the southernmost of the 3 regions involved. It would be interesting to know geographically where the cases were acquired in the 3 regions as the infectious form can be transmitted through the air over prolonged distances (that is likely why some non-livestock workers are involved). It is likely that more than one livestock farms are involved and that should be able to be obtained from a history of the affected workers.

Q fever, often acquired by close exposure to animals, is infectious with a very low inoculum and may be aerosolized over a significant distance. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This infectious form of the organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and desiccation and is highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of primates was found to be 1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_. Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large cell form, metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human-to-human transmission are rare.
