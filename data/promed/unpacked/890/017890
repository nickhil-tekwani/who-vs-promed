[1] Cambodia

As Cambodia enters its dengue season, with outbreaks in 4 out of 24
provinces, the National Dengue Control Programme (NDCP) is warning
that a repeat of the 2007 epidemic -- when about 40 000 people were
hospitalized, more than 10 000 in one week -- may be imminent.

"Based on my experience, I see the same pattern as 2007 emerging
now," said To Setha, a vector control specialist at the NDCP, pointing
to the higher number of cases than usual during the final months of
last year [2010] and the 1st 2 months of this year [2011]. Rekul Huy,
chief of epidemiology at the NDCP, is also alarmed by the high number
of cases during months when dengue is usually rare.

A change in the serotype of the virus (which has 4) from DEN2 to DEN1
detected in the middle of last year [2010] also concerns him, as does
the increase in the percentage of patients with dengue hemorrhagic
fever (DHF) in the 1st 4 months of this year [2011]: from about 50 per
cent last year to 2/3rds this year. An increase in DHF patients
signals the possible presence of a new serotype, he said.

In Cambodia, where dengue is endemic, the number of cases spikes in
June and July -- a period NDCP director Ngan Chantha refers to as the
"nightmare season" -- with major outbreaks occurring in 3-5 year
intervals.

Chantha said the number of cases at the beginning of this year [2011]
had reached the "alert" level, signalling a possible nationwide
outbreak during the rainy season. This year, however, his department
faces severe financial constraints to implement the swift
interventions necessary to contain local outbreaks before they spiral
out of control as in 2007.

405 confirmed cases of the disease, according to a bulletin issued
this Wednesday (18 [May 2011]) by the Ribeirao Preto Secretariat of
Health. Since the previous bulletin issued 15 days ago, 2055 more
cases of the disease and 3 deaths have been registered. The Health
Secretariat is still investigating another 4 deaths suspected as due
to dengue. This year, 10 suspected dengue cases were discarded. The

tests.

- Brazil (Sorocaba, Sao Paulo state). 16 May 2011. This Monday (16
[May 2011]), the Health Secretariat reported that Sorocaba has 1345
confirmed cases of the disease [dengue] from the beginning of the year
[2011] up to this past Friday (13 [May 2011]), an increase of 104
cases in one week. In the previous week, there were 207 new confirmed
cases. Of the total, 1296 are locally acquired and 49 are imported
from elsewhere.

- Brazil (south of Rio de Janeiro state). 21 May 2011. The south of
Rio de Janeiro state totaled, as of Thursday [19 May 2011], 9092
notified dengue cases; of these 5033 are now confirmed. This is
without counting the cases awaiting laboratory test results from the
state Secretariat of Health. This may be the greatest number [of
cases] reached in recent years. At least 4 cities of the region (Volta
Redonda, Angra dos Reis, Mangaratiba and Vassouras) have registered an
epidemic as of Thursday [19 May 2011], and various other [cities] lack
confirmation of a few cases, hence their situations also could be
considered alarming. The city of Volta Redonda is the one with the
most registered cases, which as of Thursday [19 May 2011] totaled
3431.

- Brazil (Niteroi and Rio de Janeiro city, Rio de Janeiro state). 20
May 2011. Niteroi now has 8 laboratory confirmed cases of dengue
[virus] type 4 [infections]. The city was the 1st, after the north and
northeast regions of the country, to register this virus type. Since
the entire population is susceptible to [dengue] virus type 4, this
increases the chances of a big epidemic in Rio next summer [2012].
Also, [dengue] virus type 1 is circulating, which had not been
detected in the state since the end of the decade of the 1980s and
returned to appear last year [2010]. The young [cohort] of the
population is most susceptible to this virus because they have never
had contact with it. Rio [city] has 10 516 new suspected [dengue]
cases. From 2 Jan-14 May of this year [2011], there were 95 931
reported cases [in the state].

epidemiological bulletin of the state Secretariat of Health (SESA)
confirmed the deaths of 2 children in Fortaleza due to dengue. In
total, this year [2011], 20 357 cases of the disease were registered,
of which 41 died. The expectation of SESA is that the epidemic is
losing its force.

epidemic. In the past 2 months, there were more than 40 reported
[dengue] cases, and 21 cases of the disease were confirmed by the

week, Mato Grosso do Sul registered 392 dengue cases, which brings the
statistics for this year [2011] to 11 698 cases of the disease. This
number is far fewer than that reported for the same period last year
[2010], when the dengue epidemic hit 77 000 victims, 5 times greater
[than this year]. In 2010, dengue killed 49 people in Mato Grosso do
Sul. The bulletin for the 19th [epidemiological] week of 2011
indicated that up until now, the disease killed 3 people [this week],
the same number as the previous week.

the [dengue] epidemic from February-April [2011] caused the deaths of
53 people, and 2011 has the greatest number of cases with 21 334
recorded and a total of 44 000 reported febrile cases suspected [as
dengue]. Ivan Allende, Director of Health Surveillance, said on Friday
[20 May 2011] that 114 people associated with the disease died, of
which 19 were discarded by laboratory tests and the remainder continue
under investigation to determine the probable cause of death.

- China (Hong Kong). 18 May 2011. The Centre for Health Protection
(CHP) of the Department of Health is today (18 May [2011])
investigating 2 related imported cases of dengue fever and urged
people to take precautions against the disease.
http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201105/18/P201105180277.htm.

[_Aedes albopictus_ is the only dengue virus vector present in Hong
Kong, so there is a risk, however slight, of ongoing local dengue
virus transmission in this densely populated city. However, there have
been several imported dengue cases over recent years without
initiating local transmission.
