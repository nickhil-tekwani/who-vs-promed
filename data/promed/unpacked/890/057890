The Ministry of Health confirmed an outbreak of cholera in the [Santiago] Metropolitan Region [MR] on Thu 23 Aug 2018: in the last 2 months, 14 suspected cases of the disease have been reported, of which 8 have been confirmed by laboratory tests.

Of the confirmed cases, the first was detected on 2 Aug 2018, in Pedro Aguirre Cerda; then 3 were registered on 9 Aug 2018 in Maipú, Quinta Normal, and Conchalí. The 5th case was located in El Bosque on 10 Aug 2018, and 5 days later, 2 more patients were confirmed in the communes of Quinta Normal and Santiago. The last was confirmed last night, 24 Aug 2018.

At the moment, the patients are concentrated from the center towards the west of the capital, although there are suspected cases in Vitacura, Las Condes, and Independencia. Yesterday, 24 Aug 2018, a new case was added, not yet confirmed, in Santiago.

The Undersecretary of Public Health, Paula Daza, assured that the strain of cholera detected does not correspond to the most aggressive one and added that the possible sources of contamination are still being studied. One hypothesis is that the origin is irrigation water. Meanwhile, the Health Department of the MR, Rosa Oyarce, reported that the public and private healthcare network was alerted, reinforcing the taking of samples in suspected cases and environmental monitoring in the region.

After the Ministry of Health yesterday, 23 Aug 2018, reported 13 suspected cases of cholera, 7 of which confirmed by the ISP [Public Health Institute], the Undersecretary of Public Health, Paula Daza, ruled out that the event implies a health alert.

As detailed by the authority, a "rigorous analysis" of the detected cases is being carried out, since until now it has not been confirmed that these could be linked. "There is no relationship between them and in fact they are from different communities," he said. Considering that it would be rather isolated facts, Daza was emphatic in stating that "it is not a health warning", but that what is being done is to deliver the corresponding information about the pathology, in order to "prevent this from spreading to the whole Metropolitan Region or the rest of the country. "

Regarding the state of health of the 3 people who were hospitalized, Daza indicated that so far "none have presented complications" and that they are individuals who had previous pathologies. In the same context, and emphasizing that the detected cases correspond to non-toxigenic _Vibrio cholerae_, the undersecretary recalled that this infection is not transmitted from person to person, but through the consumption of contaminated food or liquids.

As Independence Day [18 Sep 2018] celebrations (Fiestas Patrias) approach, the authority announced that the investigations associated with the detection of the bacteria that cause this disease will be increased.

[Chile had a toxigenic cholera outbreak that originated in neighboring Peru that affected approximately 150 persons between 1991 and 1994.

It is not stated if this cluster of cases is related to a non-toxigenic O1 or O139 strain, or a non-epidemic strain of non-O1, non-O139 _Vibrio cholerae_. As a review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic) antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139 known serogroups. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are non-virulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which is "non-O1"), a single serogroup, designated O1, has been responsible for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 serotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima, each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype (or biotype). The biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A, B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C; and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

In almost all cases, non-O1, non-O139 _V. cholerae_ isolates do not possess the genes for cholera toxin. Some isolates can cause substantial diarrhea (1-4). The type III secretion system (TTSS) is a mechanism for Gram-negative bacilli to introduce effector proteins into host cell cytoplasm (5). It has been reported that a functional TTSS is required for at least in some non-O1, non-O139 isolates to induce diarrhea in an animal model associated with small bowel damage and production of proinflammatory cytokines (6). In addition, TTSS contributes to virulence even in the presence of cholera toxin and TCP (6).
