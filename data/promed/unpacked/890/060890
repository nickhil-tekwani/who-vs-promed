Health authorities in New South Wales are assessing a number of people who have come into contact with a dog infected with the Hendra virus.

The dog came from the same property at Macksville on the mid-north coast where a horse died after contracting the virus earlier this month [July 2013]. The dog has been euthanased after it tested positive for the illness.

A total of 2 remaining horses and 2 other dogs on the property have tested negative for the illness.

New South Wales Department of Primary Industries chief veterinarian officer Ian Roth says it is only the 2nd time a dog has been infected with Hendra virus. He says people need to get their horses vaccinated to protect them from the virus. "The vaccine is only available for horses, it's not available for other animals, but we certainly recommend that people get their horses vaccinated because if the horses don't get Hendra then dogs won't get it either," he said.

A total of 4 horses and a dog have now died on separate properties in the mid-north coast area from the virus this year [2013].

[While this is only the 2nd time a dog has been reported infected with Hendra virus, it is not unlikely that there have been subclinical canine cases in the past. It is something to look out for, especially as dogs tend to be domestic, increasing the chances of human infections. - Mod.MHJ
