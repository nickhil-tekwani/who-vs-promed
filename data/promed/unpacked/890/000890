Smuggler caused Ulster outbreak
------------------------------
A sheep and diesel smuggler operating along the Ulster border was being
blamed last night for the introduction of FMD to Ireland for the first time
in 60 years.
The first case of the disease was confirmed yesterday in the village of
Meigh in south Armagh. Noel Davern, the junior agriculture minister in the
Irish republic, said: "The danger now is not from the airports or anywhere
else, but from people who acted illegally in south Armagh."
The border between Ulster and the Irish Republic is rife with smuggling.
The IRA, at the height of the troubles, smuggled huge amounts of diesel
across the border to raise funds to buy weapons.
One man was arrested by the Royal Ulster Constabulary yesterday in
connection with alleged smuggling.

Police have sealed off a farm in Co Louth as the Irish Republic maintained
a full Foot-and-Mouth Disease alert. Officials moved into the premises,
around 20 miles south of the border with Northern Ireland, in the early hours.
Reports indicated the farm may have received sheep from north of the border
that could have come into contact with the disease. The operation was
concentrated close to the main Belfast-Dublin road and about 30 miles from
the farm at Meigh, Co Armagh, where the outbreak was formally confirmed
yesterday. One possibility being investigated was the sheep delivered to Co
Louth last week may have come through Co Armagh.
It also emerged that nearly 250 lambs slaughtered at a meat processing
plant in Athleague, Co Roscommon, more than a week ago were later exported
to France. Investigators have been attempting to trace the origin of the
lambs amid suspicions they had come from Northern Ireland and police want
to interview a man involved in the delivery who has yet to come forward.
Last night the French government said it would temporarily halt livestock
imports from Ireland, but the full extent of the ban had still to be
determined. The French move was seen as the start of a direct threat to
Ireland's critical IRL 10 billion agriculture industry, a key part of the
booming Irish economy.
Last night the Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern, reported extra troops
were being sent to the Irish border to back up police traffic controls
aimed at preventing the disease spreading into the Republic. He announced
the move after chairing an emergency cabinet meeting in Dublin.
Mr. Ahern said: "We know it is not possible to seal the border totally, but
we have 141 routes manned by police, troops, veterinary staff and
Department of Agriculture inspectors. We are bringing in more and more
regulations all the time, and we just have to hope FMD [was not here
before the incubation period. At this point, there are no confirmed cases
in the country."
