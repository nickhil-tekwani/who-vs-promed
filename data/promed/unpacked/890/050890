Veterinary officers in Nyeri, Murang'a, Thika and Wajir have reported some
cattle and a rhinoceros in the care of Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) have
succumbed to the disease.
But a senior government veterinary officer, Dr John Muiruri, says the
situation is not alarming. "The cases we have of anthrax are not worrying.
There is no cause for alarm. But whenever a case is reported, we move very
fast, quarantine the place and vaccinate the animals. Only 2 cases, one in
Maragwa and another in Thika districts, have so far been detected this year."
The situation was bad between 1997 and 1998 during the outbreak of anthrax
and black water in northern Kenya.
A quarantine has been declared in Maragwa after an anthrax case was
reported in Kigumo location on 19 Apr 2001. "We have dispatched 2000 doses
of the anthrax vaccine to the area," says Dr Muiruri.
The disease is suspected to have spread to the neighboring Kihumbiri
location in Thika District, where another case was reported on 27 Apr 2001.
The government has also quarantined the area and dispatched 2000 anthrax
vaccine doses.
A white rhinoceros in Nakuru Game Park recently died of what KWS suspected
to be
anthrax. A veterinary officer with the organization, Dr Thomas Manyiba,
said microscopic analysis of samples taken from the rhinoceros showed
organisms similar to the anthrax-causing bacterium. "We cannot confirm if
it was an anthrax case, as conclusive tests requiring the culturing of the
organism were not done," he said.
Though KWS does not have the testing technique, it is leaving nothing to
chance. It disinfected and buried the carcass 6 feet deep, in line with the
recommended precautionary guidelines. Additionally, staff who might have
come into contact with the rhinoceros were advised to have penicillin
injections. Warders have since been put on high alert to monitor the
animals closely and report any death for analysis.
Said Dr Manyiba: "The rhinoceros was easily detected because, being an
endangered species, it is under continuous surveillance."
Veterinarians suspect the unusually heavy rains pounding some parts of the
country might have provided the right environment for anthrax-causing spores.

[Burying the carcass may not be sufficient, as the spores of anthrax can
survive burial for decades and serve as a source of further anthrax
outbreaks. - Mod.TG
