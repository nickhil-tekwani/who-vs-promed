1st malaria vaccine receives positive scientific opinion from EMA
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Mosquirix to be used for vaccination of young children, together with established antimalarial interventions.

The European Medicines Agency's [EMA] Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive scientific opinion for Mosquirix (_Plasmodium falciparum_ and hepatitis B vaccine), for use outside the European Union (EU).

The malaria vaccine Mosquirix, also known as RTS,S/AS01, was submitted to EMA under a regulatory procedure (Article 58) that allows EMA to assess the quality, safety and efficacy of a medicine or vaccine and its benefit-risk balance, although it will not be marketed in the EU. This means that EMA can help facilitate access to new medicines for people living outside the EU.

Mosquirix is intended for use in areas where malaria is regularly found, for the active immunisation of children aged 6 weeks to 17 months against malaria caused by the _P. falciparum_ parasite, and against hepatitis B. After decades of research into malaria vaccinations, Mosquirix is the 1st vaccine for the disease to be assessed by a regulatory agency.

The CHMP highlighted in its opinion that Mosquirix is for use in line with official recommendations that take into account the risk of _P. falciparum_ malaria in different geographical areas and available malaria control interventions. These recommendations will be defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) and regulatory authorities in the non-EU countries where the vaccine would be used.

As in all Article 58 procedures, the CHMP worked closely with other experts, including from WHO and regulatory authorities from the relevant countries. In its assessment, the CHMP applied the same rigorous standards as for medicines to be marketed within the EU.

About Mosquirix
---------------
Mosquirix is intended to protect against malaria caused by _Plasmodium falciparum_. Because of the vaccine's composition it also protects against hepatitis B (see note 3 below).

The main evidence derives from a large clinical trial conducted in seven African countries (Burkina Faso, Gabon, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania). Data from this trial showed that Mosquirix provides modest protection against _P. falciparum_ malaria in children in the 12 months following vaccination. The vaccine was effective at preventing a 1st or only clinical malaria episode in 56 percent of children aged between 5-17 months and in 31 percent of children aged 6-12 weeks. The efficacy of the vaccine decreased after one year. The safety profile of the vaccine was considered acceptable.

Based on the results of the trial the CHMP concluded that despite its limited efficacy, the benefits of Mosquirix outweigh the risks in both age groups studied. The CHMP considered that the benefits of vaccination may be particularly important among children in high-transmission areas in which mortality is very high.

Because the studies showed that Mosquirix does not offer complete protection, and the protection it provides decreases in the longer term, it is important that established protective measures, for example insecticide-treated bed nets, continue to be used in addition to the vaccine.

The CHMP also agreed a follow-up programme with the company to ensure that the safety and effectiveness of Mosquirix is continuously monitored as described in the risk management plan.

About malaria
-------------
Malaria is a disease caused by parasites known as plasmodia, which are transmitted to people through the bites of infected mosquitoes. While 5 different types of plasmodia parasites cause malaria, _P. falciparum_ is recognised as the most serious cause of malaria death and disease. If left untreated, malaria can quickly become life-threatening. According to WHO, in 2013 627 000 deaths from malaria were reported globally, of which 562 000 (approximately 90 percent) occurred in the African region mostly among children under the age of 5 years (82 percent).

Key malaria control interventions include prompt and effective treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapies, use of insecticide-treated bed nets, and indoor residual spraying with insecticide to control the mosquitoes.

More about the procedure
------------------------
The applicant received scientific advice from the CHMP in collaboration with WHO, pertaining to the quality and clinical aspects of the dossier.

The positive scientific opinion adopted by the CHMP at its July 2015 meeting is a pre-requisite for a WHO policy recommendation for the use of Mosquirix in vaccination programmes. National regulators in the countries where the vaccine will be used will take a decision on licensing the vaccine in their jurisdictions.

WHO will provide its recommendations on use of Mosquirix by November 2015. WHO's policy recommendations take into account several additional factors not addressed by EMA. These include feasibility of implementation, affordability and cost-effectiveness, and the public health value of the vaccine in relation to other available malaria control measures and vaccines.

Notes
-----
The marketing authorisation applicant for Mosquirix is GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA [GSK].

Mosquirix is a recombinant vaccine that contains an adjuvant. It is composed of a _Plasmodium falciparum_ circumsporozoite protein fused with hepatitis B surface antigen (rts), and combined with hepatitis B surface antigen(s) in the form of non-infectious virus-like particles (vlps) produced in yeast cells (_Saccharomyces cerevisiae_) by recombinant DNA technology. Therefore, the vaccination gives protection against hepatitis B. However, it should not be used to protect against hepatitis B in settings that do not require malaria prevention.

[Mosquirix (or RTS,S) vaccine is the world's 1st licenced vaccine against malaria and indeed, against any human protozoan infection. GlaxoSmithKline is to be congratulated for this scientific achievement, which has provided much information about malaria and the development of protective immunity in malaria.

The protective efficacy is found to be around 30 percent in children aged 5 to 20 months (RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership et al. N Engl J Med. 2012; 367(24): 2284-95; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1208394), but protection rapidly wanes and is probably zero after 2.5 years (Olotu A et al. N Engl J Med. 2013; 368(12): 1111-20; http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1207564).

A recent review of clinical trials of RTS,S showed that the effect was reproducible between centers if the endpoint was all malaria cases, but uneven if the endpoint was severe malaria (RTS,S Clinical Trials Partnership. Efficacy and safety of RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine with or without a booster dose in infants and children in Africa: final results of a phase 3, individually randomized, controlled trial. Lancet 2015; 386(9988): 31-45; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25913272), however the protective efficacy did improve after a booster immunization at 20 months, but without the booster, the vaccine did not reduce the risk of severe malaria.

A severe shortcoming of the data on RTS,S is that no data on mortality have been published. This is indeed surprising. The largest study with 3995 children in the vaccine arm should be able to provide mortality data and we would encourage GSK to publish mortality data from this study. However, with a lack of effect on severe malaria it can be speculated that the vaccine does not reduce malaria mortality, which is the most important endpoint in malaria control interventions.

The vaccine will not be available for travellers, and the price has not been disclosed.

Will the vaccine change the fight against malaria in endemic countries?

The lack of protection in babies younger than 5 months makes it difficult to immunize with the vaccine as part of the existing childhood immunization program, thus increasing cost of administration (separate visits of immunization teams) and compliance with all 4 injections will be a challenge.

The insecticide impregnated bed net roughly reduces the risk of malaria in endemic areas by 50 percent if used correctly. Thus the vaccine is not as effective as impregnated bed nets, which also have the benefit of lower cost of distribution and use, and impregnated nets may retain the insecticide effect for up to 5 years. Thus, impregnated bed nets will probably continue to be the main tool for malaria prevention and control in endemic areas.

What can we learn from the vaccine?
-----------------------------------
It was probably too optimistic to expect that a vaccine with just a single antigen (the CircumSporozoiteProtein, CSP) could be nearly 100 percent effective. There is antigenic variability of the CSP (Riley EM & StewartVA. Nat Med 2013; 19(2): 168-78; http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v19/n2/full/nm.3083.html) and if just one sporozoite escapes the vaccine induced antibodies and enters the liver, a malaria infection is established and the vaccine has no modulating effect on the ensuing blood stage infection. This probably explains why the vaccine had little effect against severe malaria.

The way forward is probably to include many more antigens in future vaccines. Immunization with live, attenuated sporozoites has proven protective (Seder RA et al: Protection against malaria by intravenous immunization with a nonreplicating sporozoite vaccine. Science. 2013; 341(6152): 1359-65; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23929949). Whole cell vaccines contain many more proteins and thus, more immunogenic epitopes compared to a single antigen. Recombinant vaccines and live parasites -- even if attenuated -- probably ensure a better antigen presentation to the immune system, ensuring a stronger immune response. - Mod.EP]
