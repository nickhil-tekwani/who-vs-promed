India (Kerala): Dengue-related Deaths in City of Thiruvananthapuram
--------------------------------------------------
There have been 18 confirmed cases of dengue fever so far in the district.
Addressing a press conference, the District Medical Officer, (DMO) K.
Shailaja, said that a total of 80 serum samples had been subjected to
microbiological examination. The DMO sought community participation in
vector control measures targeted at reducing the density of the mosquito
species -- _Aedes egypti_ and _Aedes albopictus_ -- which transmit dengue
virus to humans. Dr. Shailaja underlined the importance of coordinated
efforts among various departments and the public for achieving effective
vector control. Maintaining environmental hygiene was an important
component of vector control measures. There have been 2 dengue-related
deaths in the city so far. Melaranoor and Vizhinjam, where the deaths
occurred, have been declared dengue-prone areas.
According to the DMO, initial dengue infection is self- limiting and
harmless. However, a repeat infection could potentially lead to serious
medical conditions like dengue hemorraghic fever and dengue shock syndrome.
The mortality rate of dengue fever was between 1.5 percent and 23 percent
if the treatment involved a major hospital. The typical features of the
disease ranged from high fever, pain in the posterior of the eye, headache,
and body pain, and management hinged on symptomatic treatment. The vector
species breed in domestic as well as external habitats. Outlining the
measures taken by the health department, Dr. Shailaja said fogging and
pesticidal measures were concentrated at dengue outbreak sites. Rapid
action forces had been formed at the district, block, and grama panchayat
levels to check the spread of fever.

Sri Lanka: Dengue Fever Outbreak in the Puttalam District
---------------------------------------------------
Dengue fever is raising its head again in the Puttalam district causing
panic among residents. 5 children between 5 and 6 years have succumbed to
the disease after being admitted to the Puttalam hospital, while another 30
patients in a serious condition have been transferred to the Colombo
National Hospital.
Parliamentary Affairs Minister A.H.M Azwer told the Daily News that around
80 dengue fever cases have been reported from the Puttalam district this
year, where there is an urgent need for preventive measures and medical
assistance. Azwer said there was a shortage of beds and other medical
equipment in the hospitals owing to the sudden rush of dengue patients.
The Prime Minister has directed medical officers to take immediate steps to
combat the fever. Meanwhile, the people in Puttalam have launched a
one-week anti-dengue campaign in collaboration with the Puttalam Urban Council.

Sri Lanka: 67 Suspected Dengue Fever Cases Reported
-------------------------------------------------
The dengue epidemic has claimed at least 4 lives so far during this year,
health officials warned yesterday. The warning came amidst reports of one
death and a large number of suspected cases from the Puttalam district last
week. "We have got 3 unreported deaths from the same district so far," a
senior epidemiologist told the Daily News yesterday.
So far 67 suspected cases have been reported with the highest originating
from the Puttalam District with the Matara district ranking second. The
epidemiologist attributed the outbreak to the change in the weather pattern
and the carelessness of the people to keep the environment around them
clean. However, he said steps have been taken to bring the situation under
control in collaboration with the local government authorities.
During the last year, the highest number of dengue cases was reported from
the Western Province, especially from Colombo, Gampaha, and Maharagama.
Health authorities launched a special program to counter the dengue
epidemic in high risk areas such as Maharagama, Dehiwala, and Moratuwa, and
houses in those areas will be inspected every week.

Sri Lanka: Dengue Fever Cases found In Colombo
----------------------------------------------
Colombo Municipal Council's Health Department warned the public to be on
the alert after 15 dengue patients were found in the Municipality area
during the last 2 weeks. Municipal's Chief Medical Officer Dr. Pradeep
Kariyawasam told the Daily News yesterday that with the change in the
weather pattern, mosquitoes have increased in areas in Colombo. Wellawatte,
Pamankada, Kirulapona, Kotahena, Bambalapitiya, Kollupitiya, and Cinnamon
Garden have seen an increase in mosquitoes.
Dr. Kariyawasam said out of the total cases, one had arrived from abroad
while another had come from Jaffna. "We suspect both had got dengue before
arriving in Colombo," he said. Dr. Kariyawasam urged the public to keep
their environment and work places clean and destroy mosquito-breeding
places to prevent a possible outbreak.
Last year, 225 confirmed dengue cases were reported from the Colombo
Municipality area. "Given the increase in population in the city, this
figure was much lower and in fact, there was a 15 percent decrease of
patients last year compared to 2001," added Dr. Kariyawasam. Following last
year's revelation that many leading schools in the City were breeding
places for mosquitoes, the Municipality urged school authorities to be more
concerned about ensuring a clean environment in their schools. Several
students from leading schools in Colombo reportedly died from dengue fever
last year [2002]. The Municipality last year followed up its anti-dengue
campaign with a one-week 'clean-up or pay-up' deadline on households which
did not adhere to municipality health conditions.
The follow-up action is implemented under the 'Green Star Home' programme,
under which city houses which have a healthy physical environment outdoor
will be issued the "Green Star Home" label to be displayed on their walls
or doors. Legal action was taken against those who did not adhere to
Municipal instruction, under the terms of Mosquito Breeding Disease Control
Regulation

Malaysia: Dengue Alert for Students at Universiti Putra Malaysia
---------------------------------------------------
Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM) has issued a dengue alert to students
staying off-campus, especially those living in the vicinity of Serdang and
Balakong, following an 80 percent surge in dengue cases reportedly
contracted outside the campus.
UPM Health Centre director Dr Yahaya Abu Ahmad said that in December 2002
alone, 15 students came down with dengue fever, adding that only 2 of the
students who fell sick lived on campus. He said most of the students
infected by dengue were living in Sri Serdang, Sri Kembangan, Taman
Universiti, and Balakong, adding that the university had informed the local
authority -- Subang Jaya Municipal Council (MPSJ) -- on the risk areas
identified. "There are about 14 000 students staying outside campus and
over a third of them are residing in those areas. During a recent
university senior officers meeting, we highlighted the matter and have
alerted the students to take precautions," he said when contacted.
Dr Yahaya said the University had screened all students who were down with
fever apart from implementing joint "search and destroy" operations with
MPSJ. "We have combed the campus to identify risk areas or possible
mosquito-breeding grounds, including areas with thick vegetation and
construction sites. "The campus is basically safe, as the source of the
illness rests outside of the campus," he said, adding some 16 000 students,
live in the campus's hostels. Dr Yahaya also denied a rumour that a
second-year forestry studies student living on campus had succumbed to
dengue hemorrhagic fever, as a post mortem revealed that the student had
died from septicaemia, a type of pneumonia.
In Penang, 4 Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) students are suspected of
suffering from dengue fever. According to USM's Berita Kampus released
recently, the students were staying outside the Minden campus, around the
Sungai Dua area.

Malaysia: Dengue Fever Outbreak in Perak State
----------------------------------------------
The Ipoh City Council and the Kinta Health Department will join forces "to
clean up" the cluster of villages in the Manjoi area to rid it of _Aedes_
mosquitoes and allay the fear of some 24 400 residents in the locality.
This is in view of the death of 3 children in Manjoi over the last 2 weeks
after they were believed to have contracted dengue fever. State Health,
Science, Technology and Environment Committee chairman Datuk Ho Cheng Wang
said the authorities were working hard to clean up drains, clear up
containers, and carry out inspection of homes.
Manjoi which comprises Kampung Tengku Hussein, Kampung Sungai Tapah, and
Kampung Datuk Ahmad Said, comes under the purview of the council as the
people have been paying assessment to the local authority over the past few
years, but control of vector-borne diseases is still the responsibility of
the Kinta health department. Ho said the council had yet to take over the
responsibility, as it was short of staff.
2 days ago, a year-4 pupil of Sekolah Kebangsaan Manjoi died of dengue
haemorrhagic fever. The 10-year-old boy died of at 7 a.m., 8 days after he
was admitted to the Ipoh Hospital. Earlier, 2 children, a girl and a boy,
both 2 years old from the area, died of dengue on 3 and 7 Jan 2003,
respectively.
He said there were 1805 dengue-positive cases in the State last year,
compared to 983 the previous year. "There were 12 deaths last year compared
to 7 in 2001. Most of the dengue cases were reported in urban localities of
Taiping, Kuala Kangsar, and Ipoh," he said.

Taiwan: Imported Dengue Fever Case Confirmed in Taichung
--------------------------------------------------
Health officials in Taichung County are warning anyone with symptoms of
dengue fever to seek medical attention, after a man in the area was found
to have brought the disease back with him from Thailand.
Officials at the Department of Health's Center for Disease Control said
they had confirmed the first case of dengue fever in Taichung County on 10
Jan 2003. The man, who works as a sales representative for a manufacturing
company, is thought to have contracted the disease while on a business trip
to Thailand last year [2002]. He traveled to Thailand in December 2002 and
returned to Taiwan on 21 Dec 2002, health officials said.
The man was reported as living in Taichung County's Shenkang Township and
working in the nearby Waipu Township. People in both areas are being warned
that they should be on the lookout for symptoms common to dengue fever. On
26 Dec 2002, the man started to run a fever and checked into Taichung
City's Chung Shan Medical University Hospital on the 30 Dec 2002. Hospital
officials informed the Center for Disease Control (CDC) of the case and
forwarded samples taken from the man for testing. CDC officials confirmed
that the man was suffering from dengue fever on the same day. An inspection
team was sent to the man's house and place of work the next day to spray
for mosquitoes and check up on the man's family. Environmental officials
were asked to clean up the area around where the man lived and worked to
make sure that mosquitoes carrying the disease would not be able to
reproduce. Tests conducted on 32 people who came into contact with the man
all came up negative, leading health officials to express guarded
[optimism] that an outbreak of dengue fever was not imminent.
An outbreak of endemic dengue fever has been ravaging southern Taiwan since
summer 2002 and could continue into next summer.

Bolivia: Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Case in Santa Cruz
-------------------------------------------------
A 43-year-old man was discharged from the Hospital Santa Cruz on 13 Jan
2003 with a dengue hemorrhagic fever diagnosis confirmed with Ig M
seroconversion using Mac EIA test. Both hemorrhagic and hematologic
alterations [had resolved]. A serum sample was sent for serotype
identification.
Dengue virus type 2 (DEN 2) is the oldest serotype circulating in Bolivia,
whereas dengue virus type 1 (DEN 1) was introduced in 1999. Dengue
hemorrhagic fever has appeared this year possibly as a consequence of
introduction of a new strain, maybe dengue virus type 3 (DEN 3). Even now
the outbreak has had a high mortality rate: 2 cases of dengue hemorrhagic
fever have been recorded, one of whom has died.

Fiji: Dengue Fever Warning for Suva and Western Islands
-------------------------------------------------
Dengue fever, rare in Hawaii but common in the South Pacific, has broken
out in the South Pacific nation of Fiji. Radio Australia reports that a
dengue fever warning has been issued for the Fijian capital of Suva and for
Fiji's western islands. As of Fri 9 Jan 2003, 16 cases have been confirmed
at 2 hospitals.
A dengue fever outbreak on the Hana side of Maui in 2001 led to a statewide
campaign to remove mosquito habitat by throwing out junk that collects
rainwater. Mosquitos breed in standing water that contains organic matter,
such as a spare tire or rain gutter with leaves in it.

Thailand: Dengue Fever Outbreak Warning
---------------------------------------
Thailand faces a possible outbreak of dengue fever, the Public Health
Ministry has warned. The ministry recorded an unusually high number of
cases during the winter -- generally considered a low-risk period for the
disease -- and said people were becoming lax in taking preventative
measures against mosquitoes, which spread dengue fever.
Public Health Minister Sudarat Keyuraphan said in a statement received on
Monday that 6654 dengue fever cases were recorded in November [2002], twice
the number from the same period in 1998, when the disease made a major
comeback in Thailand. November is in the dry season and considered a
low-risk month for the spread of the dengue virus. With the rainy season
approaching, the situation can only get worse, the ministry statement said.
At least 171 people died out of 105 842 who contracted the flu-like fever
last year, the statement said.
Sudarat said provincial officials nationwide have been told to carry out
weekly programs to eliminate mosquito larvae. Doctors will also receive
training to diagnose the disease and will be informed that the virus is now
striking more adults. It affected mainly children in the past. Siriphen
Kalayanaruj, head of the Dengue Fever Center, said the disease has become
common in all age groups. "In Bangkok alone, 47 percent of the patients are
adults. The problem is that doctors hardly think of dengue fever when
diagnosing an adult because it's mostly found in children."
