Burundi has been experiencing an increase in the number of confirmed cases of measles since November 2019. This outbreak initially started in a refugee transit camp (Centre de transit de Cishemere, Cibitoke Health district), whose inhabitants had arrived from measles-affected provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Refugees spend 21 days in the Transit Camp of Cishemere before they are sent to permanent camps in Nyankanda and Bwagiriza refugee camps in Butezi, Kavumu camp of Cankuzo, Garsowe camp of Muyinga and Mulumba camp at Kiremba.

The outbreak was identified when suspected measles cases had been reported by the local residents in the surrounding areas, highlighting pockets of under-vaccinated populations. According to WHO/UNICEF 2018 estimates, measles 1st dose vaccination coverage is relatively high (88%), and slightly lower for the second dose (77%). However, this does not reflect the vaccination coverage of incoming refugees.

As of 27 Apr 2020, 857 confirmed measles cases have been notified from 4 districts, including: Cibitoke (624 cases), Butezi (221 cases), Cankuzo (6 cases) and South Bujumbura (6 cases). Of the measles cases in Cibitoke, 601 cases were epidemiologically linked, 20 cases were laboratory confirmed, and 3 were clinically diagnosed. In Butezi district, 27 were laboratory confirmed, 192 were epidemiologically linked, and 2 were clinically diagnosed. In Cankuzo, all 6 cases were laboratory-confirmed, whereas in the district of South Bujumbura 3 were laboratory confirmed and 3 were epidemiologically linked. Children aged 9 -- 59 months were the most affected age group, with 80% of cases in children aged 9 years or younger.

See URL above for Table 1: Distribution of confirmed cases of measles by age and sex.

No new cases have been reported in South district of Bujumbura and Cankuzo since December 2019. The last cases were reported in Butezi on 2 Mar 2020.

The outbreak in Cibitoke is ongoing. The last case in the Transit camp of Cishemere was reported on 14 Jan 2020). Globally, the total cases reported in Cishemere Transit Camp and Cibitoke health district are 67 and 557 respectively.

[Measles circulation in a population with low immunity is the cause of this outbreak. The majority of cases (77%), which originated in the refugee transit camps housing individuals from DR Congo, were either unvaccinated or unsure of their vaccination status.

A mass vaccination campaign against measles has been launched in the Democratic Republic of Congo, targeting 25 000 children in Kasabinyole, Kanzulinzuli, Madrandele, Tuungane and Malepe health zones, local media reported on [Mon 27 Apr 2020]. The vaccination campaign for children aged 0 and 5 started in the Beni health zone in North Kivu province, according to the UN Radio Okapi. It said the campaign targets 25 000 children in Kasabinyole, Kanzulinzuli, Madrandele, Tuungane and Malepe health zones.

Administrative authorities, the chief medical officer of the area, health partners including the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Ebola response team took part in the launching event.

Measles outbreak in the Central African country has killed over 6000 people, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Since the start of 2019, around 310 000 suspected measles cases have been reported.

The epidemic has been aggravated by low vaccination coverage among vulnerable communities, malnutrition, weak public health system, outbreaks of other epidemic-prone diseases, difficult access by vulnerable populations to health care and insecurity that has hampered response in some areas, WHO said in a statement in January [2020].

Although there is an effective vaccine for measles, the disease is still one of the leading causes of death among young children. The vaccination resulted in 84% drop in measles deaths between 2000 and 2016 worldwide, according to Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

[3] Mexico (Mexico City): outbreak confirmed
Date: Tue 28 Apr 2020

Public health officials in Mexico have identified a measles virus outbreak in various states in Mexico. On [24 Apr 2020], WHO reported between [1 Jan and 2 Apr 2020], 1364 probable cases of measles were reported in Mexico. The median age of these patients was 20 years and 59% were male.

This analysis conducted by the National Reference Laboratory which identified the genotype D8 (similar to other countries in the Region), linage MVs/GirSomnath.IND/42.16/.

In addition, WHO said "There is a high risk of spreading of the virus due to high population density such as Mexico City, with 427 cases, in which the high vaccination coverage could allow slow but steady transmission." According to local media, the measles outbreak in Mexico City began in a prison on 23 Feb 2020.

"At the regional level, the potential impact is considered moderate given the performance of routine immunization programs and prevention and control capacities in other countries in the region and the restrictions for travel in many countries and territories of the Region due to the pandemic of COVID-19 disease."

The WHO Region of the Americas was declared free of measles in September 2016. However, Venezuela and Brazil lost their 'measles-free' status on [1 Jul 2018] and [19 Feb 2019] respectively due to major measles outbreaks.

In 2019, 14 countries in the Region of the Americas reported confirmed cases of measles including Brazil (19 326 cases), the USA (1282 cases), Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (548 cases), and Colombia (242 cases).

Given the continued imported cases of measles from other regions and the ongoing outbreaks in countries and territories of the Region of the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization / WHO reinforces the recommendations made since February 2015 to all member states, to vaccinate to maintain homogenous coverage of 95% with the 1st and 2nd doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine in all municipalities. And provide a rapid response to imported measles cases to avoid the reestablishment of endemic transmission, through the activation of rapid response teams trained for this purpose, and by implementing national rapid response protocols when there are imported cases.

Currently, the Mexico-USA border remains closed to non-essential travelers.

In addition to the measles outbreak, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Level 1 Travel Alert for the Americans, which includes Mexico, regarding an outbreak of the dengue virus. Previously, during December 2019, CDC suggested various vaccinations prior to visiting Mexico.

https://www.theyucatantimes.com/2020/05/measles-increases-number-of-infections-to-163-cases-in-cdmx/


The latest report issued by the Health Department on [Fri 1 May 2020], states that Mexico City continues to be the area with the most cases of measles. Specifically, the Municipality of Gustavo A Madero is responsible for 42.9% of the cases. The epidemiological report on measles revealed that in the State of Mexico there are about 30 cases, and the most affected area is the municipality of Ecatepec, while in the state of Campeche 2 cases have already been reported, which are being closely monitored.

However, of the total number of people infected with measles, only 19% said they have a history of vaccination and the vast majority said they do not have it, in addition the oldest person who has contracted the disease is an adult over 67 years, while the youngest is a 3 month old baby.

Following up on this disease is of utmost importance since according to WHO, measles is one of the main causes of death among children, although in Mexico no deaths have been registered yet, the virus should not be downplayed.

Bolivia recorded at least 2 cases of measles after 20 years of epidemiological silence in the country, confirmed by health authorities -- one in the Santa Cruz region, the most hit by the coronavirus pandemic, and another in Chuquisaca.

The secretary of health of the Governorate of Santa Cruz, Academy Urenda, reported on the detected case of measles in a 29 year old pregnant woman, who was isolated for epidemiological studies. All the necessary containment work is being done, this lady is isolated and is without major symptoms, she was vaccinated, therefore, her symptoms are not serious," Urenda said at a press conference. [See ProMED-mail Measles update (13) 20200426.7269683] The secretary asked the population not to be alarmed and stressed that there is a "very high rate of vaccination", but that "all necessary precautions" are being taken to avoid an epidemiological outbreak.

After learning of the case in Santa Cruz, the director of the Departmental Health Service (Headquarters) in the Bolivian region of Chuquisaca, Martin Maturano, reported another case of measles in that department. Maturano told the media that vaccination will be strengthened in the department, which has about 40 000 doses available to carry out tracking among at-risk populations, such as those under 5 years of age.

In Bolivia the last endemic case of measles was reported in 2000 and then there was an epidemiological silence.

[6] Nepal (Kathmandu and Lalitpur)

https://reliefweb.int/report/nepal/measles-outbreaks-reported-five-districts-including-kathmandu-and-lalitpur-last-one


Measles outbreaks have been reported in several districts including in Kathmandu and Lalitpur amid the ongoing coronavirus lockdown. Since the government enforced a nationwide lockdown on [24 Mar 2020] to contain the spread of Covid-19, measles breakouts have occurred in several parts of the country with at least 2 confirmed fatalities in Dhading district. The latest cases have been reported in Kathmandu and Lalitpur.

In Kageshwori Municipality-6, Kathmandu, at least 6 children between the ages of 6 months and 14 years were diagnosed with the highly contagious disease in the past one week, Dr Biplav Adhikari, chief of Mulpani Primary Health Care Center, said. "As many as 5 of these cases were confirmed by laboratory test and the other cases were confirmed based on clinical symptoms," Adhkiari told the Post.

In Khokana, Lalitpur, at least 18 cases have been confirmed by the Immunization Section of the Department of Health Services. Before this, measles outbreaks were reported in Jhapa, Sarlahi and Dhading. Health officials said they had not witnessed so many outbreaks take place in a short span of time in recent years.

With the entire country under lockdown, routine immunisation programmes have been affected in several districts. Health officials say Rubeola virus, which causes measles and is far more contagious than the novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2, is rearing its head as the country is observing stay-at-home orders to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Many health facilities have discontinued their regular immunisation programmes while parents too have stopped seeking inoculation services for their children during the lockdown. Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director of the erstwhile Children Health Division, warns if the immunisation services are not resumed immediately, there could be another public health emergency in the country. "The rise in the number of measles outbreaks shows that the immunity level of children has declined. This is not a good sign. Not only the measles, children are at high risk of whooping coughs, diphtheria, polio and other vaccine preventable diseases," he told the Post.

Out of over 650 000 children in need of measles-rubella vaccines every year, 120 000 (about 20%) miss their inoculation schedule.

Upreti says the chances of the deadly viral disease spreading are higher even if one child misses his/her immunisation. "The coverage of measles-rubella vaccine is already low in our country and the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has dealt a severe blow to our endeavor to contain the contagious disease," Upreti said. "More people and children can die from the other diseases than from the COVID-19."

The Ministry of Health and Population suspended measles-rubella vaccination drive for an indefinite period after the lockdown. The recent outbreaks have forced the ministry to reconsider its decision. "We are aware of the risk of a possible health crisis. We have already asked the health facilities across the country to resume the regular immunisation programmes after reports about measles outbreaks," Dr Jhalak Sharma, chief of the Immunization Section of the Department of Health Services, told the Post.

Measles was once endemic in Nepal with an average 90 000 cases reported annually from 1994 to 2004. The government launched a routine measles vaccination programme in the country in the late 1980s. Although Nepal had committed to eliminating measles by 2019, the deadline was extended to 2023 due to frequent occurrences of the disease. To achieve measles-eliminated status, the number of cases should be lower than 5 in a million people or no cases throughout a year.

[7] Philippines (Luzon): decrease in cases
Date: Thu 7 May 2020
Source: Manila Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.manilatimes.net/2020/05/07/news/national/ecq-reduced-measles-cases-expert/723143/


The enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) implemented in Metro Manila and other areas in Luzon has lowered the incidence of a measles outbreak in the country, according to an infectious disease expert. Philippine Foundation for Vaccination director Dr Lulu Bravo said several measures imposed to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also reduced the number of measles cases. "With ECQ, there have been dramatic reductions of measles if you compare it on the same time last year [2019]," she added. "It was terrible last year," she said, referring to the 47 871 reported cases of measles, with 632 deaths.

As of February this year [2020], only 189 cases and 10 deaths have been reported in comparison with 8443 and 189 deaths at the same time last year [2019], according to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

"The ECQ did not just reduce the cases of COVID-19, but the projected number for measles, as well. The physical distancing was effective in combating measles, because it is airborne," Bravo said.

[Quarantine of the population likely did contribute to dampening virus transmission outside the family unit from those who are currently infected, but a long-term effect of quarantine may be increased transmission if vaccinations are interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019 when there was a major measles outbreak in the country, the government launched a massive nationwide measles vaccination campaign. Health workers inoculated 5.5 million people, mostly kids. The government hoped to immunize another 15 million by the end of September 2019. The campaign was very effective in stopping the measles outbreak at the time. This increased the immunization rate and likely also contributed to the low prevalence this year. Good news! - Mod.LK
