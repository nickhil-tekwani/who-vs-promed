INFECTION CONTROL - ILLINOIS, USA
=================================
Date: Fri, 31 May 1996 15:57:03 CDT
From: "Richard A. Murphy " <U14663@UICVM.CC.UIC.EDU>

I am an infection control person in the Univ. of Illinois College of
Dentistry. As such we are not really culturing and doing antibiotic
sensitivity determinations. I AM on the U of I Hospital's Infections
Committee. Sorry to say, I am swamped right now, but I could, at
some point in the future check on the answer to the question on
what we are seeing in the way of antibiotic resistant micro-organisms,
if you'd like.
