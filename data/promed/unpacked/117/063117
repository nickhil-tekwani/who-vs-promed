An anthrax outbreak has been reported on 14th July outside Kazakhstan's new
capital.
A major outbreak of anthrax has been reported by the public health
investigative epidemiologists in Arshalynskiy District of Akmola Region,
about 70 km from the new Kazakh capital, Astana.
Three people have been taken to hospital suffering from the disease. As is
usual in these circumstances the Regional prosecutor's office is
investigating the outbreak.

[One of the problems with anthrax control in Central Asia, and even Russia,
is their Soviet tradition of investigating such outbreaks with a policeman
mentality. This has a negative impact on encouraging prompt reporting,
reinforced when fines are imposed. One should think like a priest in these
circumstances. For those geographically challenged, Akmola is in northern
Kazakhstan and near the Russian border. - Mod.MHJ
