An ongoing outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in white-tailed deer in Illinois has resulted in reports from concerned citizens of more than 700 deer mortalities in 51 counties through August [2012], according to data compiled by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. Hemorrhagic disease is many times referred to as blue tongue disease in white-tailed deer.

EHD is a viral disease, spread by tiny biting gnats, which can cause high fever and severe internal bleeding in deer.

While often fatal in deer, EHD is not hazardous to humans, livestock or pets. EHD is related to, but not the same as "blue tongue," which affects sheep and cattle. Domestic animals can be infected but rarely develop serious illness, according to the Illinois Department of Agriculture.

This disease is not new to our state or to Vermilion County. It is just that some years are worse than others. The cooler temperatures will help slow down the spread of this disease and this is one of nature's ways of simply controlling the deer herd.

There are hundreds of new reports of deer deaths throughout West Michigan coming in to the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) as epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD, spreads to new deer populations. The massive die-offs are caused by a virus associated with the disease that's spread by flies.

The hardest hit county is still Ionia, with 50 new cases reported, bringing the total number of reported cases to 1660. In Kent County, there were 85 new cases according to the DNR, more than double the number bringing the total to 126.

Updated numbers from other counties haven't been released, but there have been already more than 3100 cases statewide as of Monday [17 Sep 2012] evening, according to DNR Wildlife Biologist John Niewoonder. He says more new numbers for other counties could be ready for release Tuesday [18 Sep 2012].

FOX 17 spoke with a hunter [from] Oakfield Township in Kent County Monday [17 Sep 2012]. [He said] he's found as many as 40 dead deer on the 3-acre property he typically hunts on each fall. He says the deer are coming to the marsh area sick and dying on the spot. "I walked a perimeter pond right there and [saw] a total of 39 deer."

There are so many deer bodies in such a small space, the area smells like decomposing deer. "This particular piece I found 7 bucks dead yesterday [12 Sep 2012], the rest were all does and fawns," [said the hunter].

[The hunter] and his dad, have been trekking through the woods and fields in the rural area, trying to count the animals.

The DNR says the deer are being found near or in water because they are trying to cool off due to high fevers associated with the virus.

"It`s absolutely devastating, a lot of us try to manage the deer herd, shoot older deer if we can. When you put all this effort into a piece of property and then you go for a walk in early fall and you find all your deer dead, it's hard to express in words. It`s terrible," [he said].

The deer may only get some relief when the region experiences a hard frost which will kill the biting midge fly that carries the virus. The fly breeds in mud and the dry summer has created a bumper crop.

If you find dead deer, the DNR will not come out and pick them up. Biologists say you will have to bury them or let nature takes its course.

They are asking that you call your local DNR field office when you spot deer that are dead and have no other injuries, such as those caused by a car. Biologists believe there are hundreds if not thousands of deer deaths that will go unreported because people will not find the deer. They hope folks call in so they can get an accurate count of how many deer will die off this season.

Niewoonder says Michigan has never experienced an outbreak of EHD like this before. Although there have been some mild outbreaks in the past, he says it's been nothing like this year's outbreak. He says typically this is a disease that is associated with the warmer, southern states of the US.

White-tail deer in New Jersey are dying from an outbreak of a viral infection spread by small flies, the state Division of Fish and Wildlife said today.

The disease -- epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) -- cannot be transmitted to humans, but officials are asking hunters and outdoor enthusiasts to report sightings of deer with symptoms of the illness.

EHD type 2 virus has been confirmed in Gloucester, Salem, and Warren counties and test results are pending for samples from Cape May, Cumberland, Camden, Monmouth, and Middlesex counties.

White-tailed deer are under threat from an outbreak of a fatal disease transmitted by midge flies.

Approximately 2 800 reported deer deaths across the state from mid-July and Monday [17 Sep 2012] are thought to be related to the disease, according to the Missouri Department of Conservation. An additional 150 deaths had been reported since noon on Monday [17 Sep 2012].

Conservation deer biologist Jason Sumners said it is difficult to fully understand the problem because only a small proportion of deaths caused by the disease are reported. The disease isn't new, but Sumners believes the outbreak is one of the largest in Missouri. "This is as bad as we have ever experienced," he said.

Sumners said 75 of the reported deaths were scattered across Boone County.

The virus, hemorrhagic disease, is transmitted through midge fly bites. Disease outbreaks are especially severe during drought years because the deer and the midge flies congregate near the fewer available watering spots, Sumners said.

Sumners said some infected deer will recover from the disease but based on studies of past outbreaks the survival rate is a small proportion of the infected population.

Hemorrhagic disease is a general term that applies to epizootic hemorrhagic disease and bluetongue disease. Sumners said the virus takes 5 to 7 days for the disease to establish itself and 8 to 36 hours to become fatal. The disease causes fever, swollen neck, tongue and eyelids, reduced activity, excessive salivation and death.

The disease will continue to be transmitted to deer until the 1st frost kills off the midge flies, Sumners said.

While Sumners said locales especially hard hit by the disease could expect lower harvests this hunting season, the overall impact on hunting will not be known until after the season.

"It won't be until after the completion of firearms season and more people come out of the woods that we see the impact on the harvest," Sumners said.

The disease cannot be transmitted to humans and the handling or consumption of meat from deer that have recovered pose no health risks, according to a Department of Conservation news release. The release also said hemorrhagic disease is not related to chronic wasting disease.

Outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease are being reported in other states, and Sumners said the impact in Missouri is similar to Nebraska and parts of Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.

[EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in the southeast USA. However, the magnitude of the outbreaks depends on climatic factors that influence the fitness of the vector. This year the outbreaks appear to be more severe than usual in some states.
