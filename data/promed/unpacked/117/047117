[Newcastle Disease recently recurred after an almost 20-year hiatus in
Greece. In this case, Cyprus has been free of the disease for over 12
years. Bulgaria's previous outbreak prior to this year's was in
1993. Albania, on the other hand, has been subject to Newcastle for most
of the last decade. - Mod.PC]
