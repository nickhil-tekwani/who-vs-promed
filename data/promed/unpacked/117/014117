Subject: hemorrhagic calicivirus outbreak

Focal outbreak of an unusually virulent strain of feline calicivirus
---------------------------
We are investigating an outbreak of hemorrhagic calicivirus in cats in Los
Angeles. The virus appears to be a variant of the common feline
calicivirus which causes upper respiratory tract infection (URI) in many
cats, but cats in the current outbreak suffer extraordinarily high
mortality and morbidity.
Cats present variably, (and numbers given here are preliminary), with
approximately 50 percent having facial and paw edema (often markedly so),
90 percent febrile (as high as 106 F), 50 percent with classical signs of
URI (ocular and nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, and vesicular or
ulcerative stomatitis), 20 percent with icterus, and 30-40 percent with
hemorrhage (from nose, feces, et al.).
Necropsy findings also are variable, including lung consolidation and
pneumonia (80 percent), hepatomegaly (50 percent), pancreatitis (10
percent), and pericarditis (10 percent).
We are working with a case definition assigning cats as suspect or probable
cases. Edema and hemorrhagic discharge occur in probable cases, regardless
of concurrent signs of URI. Cats with unusually severe URI, icterus,
pericarditis, or other associated problems but historical exposure are
regarded as suspect. Since 7/2/02 when we first were contacted with the
unusual clinical description, we have observed 30 probable cases in 3
veterinary practices and one foster care network in west L.A. 30-50 percent
of cases died or were euthanized.
All cases appear to have originated from a single source and spread via
traffic within and between hospitals and hospital clients. In two cases,
well cats in homes have acquired the infection and died after sick cats
returned home. As a precaution, all area animal shelters have been alerted
to this disease; however, no cases from animal shelters have been reported.
There was an unfortunate delay in informing local public health officials
who had earlier informed local veterinarians to contact them if there were
suspect zoonotic or potentially biological warfare agent
outbreaks (which this fortunately is NOT).
The incubation period of feline calicivirus (including this hemorrhagic
strain) is between 1-5 days. Cats of all ages, including fully vaccinated
cats, have been affected, although some affected cats have been
immunosuppressed (with neoplasia and chemotherapy). No other species is
known to be affected by this strain of calicivirus. Based on several
previous outbreaks, the only good news is that the virus is so virulent
and infected cats die so quickly that it appears difficult for an epidemic
to propagate and the incidence rapidly declines within a few weeks.
Based on previous cases, recovering cats may shed infectious virus for
weeks after infection. Infected cats become viremic (as do cats with
calicivirus URI). Diagnosis is based on culture of virus from blood,
spleen, lungs, nasal or ocular discharge, clinical signs, and pathology.
The virulence determinants associated with this virus are not known but the
pathogenesis involves vasculitis. Further investigation of the pathogenesis
of disease is being pursued. All isolates of the virus will be sequenced to
confirm that all are related to the virus from the index case and an
epidemiological/statistical summary will be completed as soon as possible.
A summary of the clinical disease was published previously: Pedersen,
Elliot, Glasgow, Poland, and Keel. 2000. An isolated epizootic of
hemorrhagic-like fever in cats caused by a novel and highly virulent strain
of feline calicivirus. Vet Micro 73:281-300.

[It is entirely possible that this Calicivirus outbreak is in some way
related to the virulent, hemorrhagic calcivirus so profoundly affecting the
rabbit population in Australia. Currently, there appear to have been at
least 30 cats affected in this outbreak. However, the investigation is on
going, and those numbers may change. - Mod.TG]
[Our thanks to Drs. Foley and Hurley for sharing this investigation with
ProMED-mail, and to other subscribers who also brought this to our
attention. There was mention of a another outbreak in Washington State, but
we have been unable to find information on this second outbreak. - Mod. MPP]
