Prevalence of Sleeping Sickness Very High in the Republic of Congo
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary results in the Republic of Congo (ROC) indicate a very high
prevalence of human African trypanosomiasis, better known as sleeping
sickness, MSF-Belgium [Medecins sans Frontieres reported last week. "Up to
now we have actively screened 1570 people in Gombona town and
surroundings", said country coordinator Sonja van Osch. "There we found an
overall prevalence of 6.5 percent. This is terribly high".
MSF began its sleeping sickness program when it noticed signs that the
disease may have reached epidemic proportions in parts of the country. The
health system is in ruins after years of civil war and there is no reliable
epidemiological data, according to MSF. "We felt that we should start an
intervention in Plateaux, since we suspected that province to be one of the
centers of the epidemic," van Osch said. The MSF team, based in Gamboma, is
currently conducting a survey, screening the population in Plateaux, which
borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Levels are averaging around 5
to 6 percent (with a local peak of 24.6 percent). Treatment is being
offered to people who test positive.

[The report show that trypanosomiasis now is at least as prevalent as
before the control program was initiated in the 1920's, probably even more
so. Whether the increase in the Congo can be related to the apparent
increase in Tanzania remains to be shown - Mod.EP
