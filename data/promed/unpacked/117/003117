I suspect that this is a reference to _Echinococcus multilocularis_ not
_E. granulosis_. GIDEON notes the following regarding this parasite in Japan:
Multilocular echinococcosis is reported from Hokkaido, Rebun Island and the
Kuril Islands.
A total of 373 cases were reported during 1937 to 1997 (141 of these since
1984) - 131 on Rebun Island and 222 on Hokkaido. 208 cases were registered
in Kon-sen during 1965 to 1997. 26 fatal cases were reported during 1985
to 1997. Foxes and voles are the principal reservoirs in Japan.

The article posted from Associate Press 19 Oct 1999 about echinococcosis on
Honshu, Japan was interesting and accurate. Unfortunately this is cannot
be said for the ProMED comments.
_Echinococcus granulosus_ is not known to be transmitted on either Honshu
or Hokkaido.
The cysts in pigs have been identified as being _E. multilocularis_.
The statement "The eggs may be acquired from eating inadequately cooked
meat that contains the cysts" is a very unfortunate misrepresentation of
the parasite's life cycle. Eggs are produced by the adult tapeworm in the
small intestine of a fox or dog and are released with feces. These are
infectious to a variety of mammalian species including voles (which are
commonly involved in transmitting the infection), humans and, as we can see
from this incident from Japan, pigs. When the hydatid cyst material from
an infected intermediate host is eaten by a fox or dog, the life cycle is
completed.
It is not known yet whether _E. multilocularis_ infection is being
transmitted on Honshu. Infection is endemic on Hokkaido and there is a
railway tunnel between Hokkaido and Honshu, providing the possibility for
infected foxes to move from Hokkaido to Honshu and establish transmission
on Honshu. Alveolar hydatid disease in humans caused by _E.
multilocularis_ is a very serious disease with a high mortality rate.
Establishment of transmission on Honshu would be a disaster.

[This moderator is appropriately corrected and offers a very humble
apology. Based on resources at hand and because of the involvement of pigs,
the inappropriate agent was stated. I appreciate the education. It is never
the intent of ProMED to distribute false or misleading information. Thank
you all for bring this to my attention. - Mod.TG.
