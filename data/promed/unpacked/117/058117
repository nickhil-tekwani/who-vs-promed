Russia on Sat 20 Feb 2021 approved a 3rd coronavirus vaccine for domestic use, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on state TV, though large-scale clinical trials of the shot, labelled CoviVac and produced by the Chumakov Centre, have yet to begin.

Russia has already approved 2 COVID-19 vaccines, including the Sputnik V shot, developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, following a similar approach of granting approval before seeing any late-stage trial results.

The preemptive approvals had raised concerns among some scientists in the West, but inoculations with those 1st 2 shots began on a mass scale in Russia only after trials were concluded and showed success.

Sputnik V was approved in August 2020, and late-stage trials began in September 2020. Mass vaccination was launched in December 2020, after preliminary trial results showed the vaccine to be 91.4% effective.

Since then, more than 2 million Russians have been vaccinated with at least the 1st dose of Sputnik V, Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said on 10 Feb 2021.

Rollout of a 2nd vaccine, developed by the Vector Institute in Novosibirsk, is beginning.

"Today, Russia is the only country to have already 3 vaccines against COVID-19," Prime Minister Mishustin said.

The Chumakov Centre, founded in 1955 in St Petersburg by Mikhail Chumakov, is known for its work with U.S. scientist Albert Sabin at the height of the Cold War, which led to the production of the widely used polio vaccine.

Unlike the Sputnik V vaccine, which uses a modified harmless cold virus that tricks the body into producing antigens to help the immune system prepare for a coronavirus infection, the CoviVac vaccine is a "whole-virion" vaccine. This means it is made of a coronavirus that has been inactivated or stripped of its ability to replicate.

"The vaccine we have developed reflects the whole history of Russian as well as global vaccine science," the Chumakov Centre's director, Aidar Ishmukhametov, said on Sat 20 Feb 2021.

The advantage, according to virologist Alexander Chepurnov, cited by outlet Lenta.Ru, is that CoviVac includes all elements of the virus, creating a broader immune response that is likely to protect against any variants.

However, testing Russia's COVID-19 shots against SARS-CoV-2 variants that have emerged in the UK, South Africa and elsewhere is in its early stages. President Vladimir Putin on Monday [15 Feb 2021] ordered a review of Russia's COVID-19 vaccines to be presented by 15 Mar 2021 assessing their ability to protect against the new variants.

Globally, one other major vaccine candidate -- India's COVAXIN by Bharat Biotech -- uses the "whole-virion" approach.

India's drug regulator has touted the shot's ability to act against the whole body of a virus instead of just its "spike-protein" tip, potentially making it more effective in case of mutations.

The CoviVac shot is given in 2 doses, 14 days apart. It is transported and stored at normal fridge temperatures, of 2-8 C [35.6-46.4 F], Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova said in a government briefing in January 2021.

The shot has already been tested for safety on 200 people aged between 18 and 60, Ishmukhametov told the state-run Vesti-24 news channel in late January 2021.

This early-stage trial began on 21 Sep 2020, according to the state clinical trials register. It showed no side-effects, including no rise in temperature, Ishmukhametov said.

Mid-stage trials to test volunteers' immune responses were ongoing, he said at the time.

Only a placebo-controlled, large-scale trial could ascertain effectiveness, he added. This is due to begin now that the go-ahead has been granted.

The 1st 120 000 doses, however, will be produced and released to the national inoculation programme in March 2021, Mishustin said.

Then, the Chumakov Centre will produce around half a million doses per month on its platforms, Ishmukhametov said on Sat 20 Feb 2021.

Deputy Prime Minister Golikova also announced on Sat 20 Feb 2021 that Russia will produce 88 million vaccine doses in the 1st half of this year [2020], including 83 million Sputnik V doses.

[B] UK: One Pfizer/BioNTech shot protection
Date: Fri 19 Feb 2021
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/feb/19/one-pfizerbiontech-shot-gives-85-covid-protection-study


A single dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine gives people 85% protection from Covid-19, according to a study from Israel.

Pfizer has consistently said that 2 doses of the vaccine are needed for high efficacy. In clinical trials, it reported efficacy of 52.4% after one dose, but 95% after 2 doses.

The UK government in December 2020 nonetheless decided on a policy of giving as many people as possible a 1st vaccine shot by increasing the gap between doses of the Pfizer and the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. The 2nd dose is now given up to 12 weeks after the 1st.

Pfizer/BioNTech has not supported the approach, arguing that the vaccine has not been through trials to show what efficacy looked like after 3 months with one dose.

A team of researchers in Israel, which is ahead of every other country in its immunisation programme and is using the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, has found that efficacy is high just before people have their 2nd dose.

In the Lancet medical journal, staff at the Sheba Medical Centre, the country's largest hospital, published their analysis of data from the vaccination of more than 9000 healthcare workers. They found that efficacy increased over time. "What we see is a really high effectiveness right after 2 weeks, between 2 weeks to 4 weeks after vaccine, already high effectiveness of 85% reduction of symptomatic infection," Gili Regev-Yochay, co-author of the study, told a small group of journalists.

Including asymptomatic cases, the efficacy was 75%. People in Israel receive their 2nd dose at around 3 to 4 weeks after the 1st, but scientists do not expect the efficacy to wane in the couple of months after a single dose.

Their findings are in line with evidence from Public Health England in December 2020, which supported the UK government's decision to increase the gap in dosing. The manufacturer's data showed that the vaccine was only 52.4% effective between the 1st and 2nd dose. The PHE paper, however, said the figure "includes Covid-19 infections occurring shortly after the 1st dose, an interval within which this dose would not be expected to have had an effect [i.e. prior to the recipient mounting an immune response]."

PHE re-did the sums using only infections that occurred from 14 days after the 1st dose and found efficacy of around 90% before the 2nd dose.

Also, in the Lancet, Oxford University has published the detailed results of an analysis of the data in trials of the vaccine it made with AstraZeneca, looking at efficacy after a single dose.

The paper found that the efficacy of a single dose was 76%, measured after the 1st 22 days. People who received 2 doses, 12 weeks apart, had protection of 85% against symptomatic disease, while for those whose 2 doses were given 6 weeks, apart it was 55%.

"Vaccine supply is likely to be limited, at least in the short term, and so policymakers must decide how best to deliver doses to achieve the greatest public health benefit," said the lead author, Prof Andrew Pollard.

"Where there is a limited supply, policies of initially vaccinating more people with a single dose may provide greater immediate population protection than vaccinating half the number of people with 2 doses. In the long term, a 2nd dose should ensure long-lived immunity, and so we encourage everyone who has had their 1st vaccine to ensure they receive both doses."

All the vaccines have been shown to protect against severe disease, hospital admission, and death, but the big outstanding question is whether they can reduce transmission of the virus, which would slow the pandemic. A study as yet unpublished from Israel may suggest they do.

According to the Reuters news agency, an analysis of data from a study by the Israeli health ministry and Pfizer has found that its vaccine reduces infection in asymptomatic cases by 89.4% and in symptomatic cases by 93.7%. Neither the ministry nor the company has confirmed the findings.

[C] Israel: Early rate reductions of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 in BNT162b2 vaccine recipients
Date: 18 Feb 2021
Source: Lancet [edited]
https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(21)00448-7


In December 2020, the Israeli Government approved the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine and initiated a national immunisation campaign prioritising healthcare workers (HCWs) as in other countries.

This campaign coincided with a 3rd wave of COVID-19, peaking at 10 116 daily new cases by mid-January 2021. The Sheba Medical Centre, Israel's largest hospital with 9647 HCWs, began staff vaccination on 19 Dec 2020. All HCWs, excluding those with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, were eligible for vaccination. Clinical trial data of BNT162b2 vaccine estimated an early vaccine efficacy in preventing COVID-19 of 52.4% before dose 2, and 90.5% on days 2-7 after dose 2.

A recent analysis of BNT162b2 vaccine data estimated vaccine efficacy of 89-91% during days 15-28 after the 1st dose.

We examined early reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 rates in vaccinated HCWs. To assess vaccine-associated rate reductions, we analysed a retrospective cohort of 9109 vaccine-eligible HCWs, comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated. Active daily symptom reporting and immediate same-day testing allowed for prompt (under 24 hours) detection and investigation of exposed or symptomatic HCWs.

We defined all HCWs with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR at Sheba Medical Centre or in the community as cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. All SARS-CoV-2-infected HCWs were contacted by infection control staff and requested to respond to a contact tracing questionnaire and a clinical questionnaire specifically regarding COVID-19 symptoms. Symptomatic HCWs were defined as COVID-19 cases. We used the number of days each HCW was unvaccinated or days after the 1st dose as follow-up time. Rate ratios and 95% CIs associated with time after 1st-dose administration were adjusted for community exposure, using the distribution of probability of a positive contact by means of Poisson regression (appendix). The adjusted estimates were subtracted from 1 to obtain rate reductions.

By 24 Jan 2021, of the 9109 eligible staff, 7214 (79%) had received a 1st dose, and 6037 (66%) had received the 2nd dose. 5505 (91%) fully vaccinated HCWs received the 2nd dose on days 21 or 22 after the 1st dose. 6818 (95%) HCWs were vaccinated at Sheba Medical Centre. All employees vaccinated in the community (n=396) were required to report dates of 1st and 2nd dose to the Human Resources department at Sheba Medical Centre.

Overall, there were 170 SARS-CoV-2 infections among HCWs in the period between 19 Dec 2020, and 24 Jan 2021, of which 99 (58%) HCWs reported symptoms and were designated as COVID-19 cases. Of the 170 HCWs who became infected, 89 (52%) were unvaccinated, 78 (46%) tested positive after the 1st dose, and 3 (2%) tested positive after the 2nd dose. Among the 125 infections that could be traced, 87 (70%) were community acquired, and there were no nosocomial clusters.

Compared with a SARS-CoV-2 infection rate of 7.4 per 10 000 person-days in unvaccinated HCWs, infection rates were 5.5 per 10 000 person-days and 3.0 per 10 000 person-days on days 1-14 and 15-28 after the 1st dose of the vaccine, respectively. Adjusted rate reductions of SARS-CoV-2 infections were 30% (95% CI 2-50) and 75% (72-84) for days 1-14 and days 15-28 after the 1st dose, respectively (table; appendix).

Compared with a symptomatic COVID-19 rate of 5.0 per 10 000 person-days in unvaccinated HCWs, disease rates were 2.8 and 1.2 per 10 000 person-days on days 1-14 and days 15-28 after the 1st dose of the vaccine, respectively. Adjusted rate reductions of COVID-19 disease were 47% (95% CI 17-66) and 85% (71-92) for days 1-14 and days 15-28 after the 1st dose, respectively.

The limitations of this study include the observational nature of the study design. Lack of active laboratory surveillance in the cohort might have resulted in an underestimation of asymptomatic cases. Data on vaccine efficacy in preventing asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection are scarce, and our results of rate reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections, which include asymptomatic HCWs, need further validation through active surveillance and sampling of vaccinated people and unvaccinated controls to ascertain the actual reduction of asymptomatic infection in vaccinated individuals. The early rate reductions seen in HCWs might differ from vaccine efficacy reported in the general population due to their higher exposure risk or due to exposure to more virulent or infectious strains.

Our data show substantial early reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infection and symptomatic COVID-19 rates following 1st vaccine dose administration. Early reductions of COVID-19 rates provide support of delaying the 2nd dose in countries facing vaccine shortages and scarce resources, so as to allow higher population coverage with a single dose. Longer follow-up to assess long-term effectiveness of a single dose is needed to inform a 2nd dose delay policy.

https://www.indiatoday.in/coronavirus-outbreak/story/spread-of-mutant-covid-variant-n440k-more-prevalent-in-southern-india-study-1771133-2021-02-19


In what can only be described as an exhaustive analysis, the Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular & Molecular Biology (CSIR-CCMB) has released a study of Covid-19 variants. Researchers and scientists analysed more than 5000 coronavirus variants detected in India and their evolution over the course of the pandemic for the purpose of this study.

The CSIR-CCMB study asserts that though mutated variants of Covid-19 have set alarm bells ringing in other countries, their prevalence in India has been low so far. These include the variants with immune-escape E484K mutation and the N501Y mutation with a higher-transmission rate.

"However, their apparent low prevalence might be simply because not enough sequencing has been done. More coronavirus genomes need to be sequenced across the country to accurately identify the emergence of these and other new variants," CSIR-CCMB Director Dr Rakesh Mishra said.

The study also found that a few variants of Covid-19 are spreading more in certain states in India, mostly in the southern region.

A corresponding author of the study, Dr Mishra added, "We now have emerging evidence that N440K is spreading a lot more in southern states. Closer surveillance is needed to understand its spread properly."

"Accurate and timely detection of new variants that may show greater infectivity or worse clinical symptoms, including immune escape, will be extremely important to preempt disastrous consequences," Dr Rakesh Mishra told India Today.

In this paper, researchers have explained how different Covid-19 variants gained prevalence in India during the last year.

According to Hyderabad-based CSIR-CCMB, the recently-discovered variants of Covid-19 have fueled concerns owing to the mutations in the spike protein of the virus.

Dr Divya Tej Sowpati, a co-corresponding author of this study said, "The spike protein is required for binding to the receptors on human cells. Mutations in this protein can help the virus in some cases. It can increase viral transmission rates by enhancing its affinity to human receptors. Some of these coronavirus variants can also immune-escape, and cause re-infection."

[3] Genomic Surveillance
Date: 18 Feb 2021

https://directorsblog.nih.gov/2021/02/18/south-africa-study-shows-power-of-genomic-surveillance-amid-covid-19-pandemic/amp/?__twitter_impression=true


Considerable research is underway around the world to monitor the spread of new variants of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That includes the variant B.1.351 (also known as 501Y.V2), which emerged in South Africa towards the end of 2020 [1,2]. Public health officials in South Africa have been busy tracing the spread of this genomic variant and others across their country. And a new analysis of such data reveals that dozens of distinct coronavirus variants were already circulating in South Africa well before the appearance of B.1.351.

A study of more than 1300 near-whole genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, published recently in the journal Nature Medicine, shows there were in fact at least 42 SARS-CoV-2 variants spreading in South Africa within the pandemic's 1st 6 months in that country [3]. Among them were 16 variants that had never before been described. Most of the single-letter changes carried by these variants didn't change the virus in important ways and didn't rise to significant frequency. But the findings come as another critical reminder of the value of genomic surveillance to track the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to identify any potentially worrisome new variants and to inform measures to get this devastating pandemic under control.

SARS-CoV-2 was 1st detected in South Africa on 15 Mar 2020, in a traveler returning from Italy. By November 2020, despite considerable efforts to slow the spread, more than 785 000 people in South Africa were infected, accounting for about half of all reported COVID-19 cases on the African continent.

Recognizing the importance of genomic surveillance, researchers led by Houriiyah Tegally and Tulio de Oliveira, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa, wasted no time in producing 1365 near-complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes by mid-September 2020, near the end of the coronavirus's 1st peak in the country. Those samples had been collected in hundreds of clinics over the course of the pandemic in 8 of South Africa's 9 provinces, offering a broad picture of the spread and emergence of new variants across the country.

The data revealed 3 main variants, dubbed B.1.1.54, B.1.1.56, and C.1, that were responsible for 42 percent of all the infections in South Africa's 1st wave. Of the 16 newly described variants, most carried single-letter changes that haven't been identified in other countries.

The majority of changes were what scientists refer to as "synonymous," meaning that they don't change the structure or function of any of the virus's essential proteins. The exception is the newly identified C.1, which includes 16 single-letter changes compared to the original sequence from Wuhan, China. One of those 16 changes swaps a single amino acid for another on SARS-CoV-2's spike protein. That's notable because the spike protein is a key target of antibodies and also is essential to the virus's ability to infect human cells.

In fact, 4 of the most prevalent variants in South Africa all carry this same mutation. The researchers also saw 3 other changes that would alter the spike protein in different ways, although the significance of these for viral spread and our efforts to stop it isn't yet clear.

Importantly, the data show that the bulk of introductions to South Africa happened early on, before lockdown and travel restrictions were implemented in late March 2020. Subsequently, much of the spread within South Africa stemmed from hospital outbreaks. For example, an outbreak of the C.1 variant in the North West Province in April 2020 ultimately led this variant to become the most geographically widespread in South Africa by the end of August 2020. Meanwhile, an earlier identified South African-specific variant, B.1.106, 1st identified in April 2020, vanished altogether after outbreaks were controlled in KwaZulu-Natal Province, where the researchers reside.

Genomic surveillance has remarkable power for understanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and tracking the dynamics of its transmission. Tegally and de Oliveira's team notes that this type of intensive genomic surveillance now can be used on a large scale across Africa and around the world to identify new variants of SARS-CoV-2 and to develop timely measures to control the spread of the virus. They're now working with the African CDC to expand genomic surveillance across Africa.

Such genomic surveillance was crucial in the subsequent identification of the B.1.351 variant in South Africa that we've been hearing so much about, with its potential to evade our current treatments and vaccines. By picking up on such concerning mutations early through genomic surveillance and understanding how the virus is spreading over time and space, the hope is we'll be better informed and more adept in our efforts to get this pandemic under control.

[According to the WHO guidance on genomic sequencing released in January 2021, Global surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences and related metadata can help in tracking the spread of SARS-CoV-2 geographically over time and ensure that mutations that could potentially influence pathogenicity, transmission or countermeasures (such as vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics) are detected and assessed in a timely manner. Even though the cost and complexity of genetic sequencing has come down significantly over time, effective sequencing programmes will still require substantial investment in terms of staff, equipment, reagents and bioinformatics infrastructure.

However, the capacity to carry out genetic sequencing at a sustained rate medium to long term is likely to present challenges to most middle- and low-resource countries, and, therefore, each country is encouraged to carry out prioritization exercises. Not only is genomic sequencing data required to understand viral trends, sharing it on global platforms is equally essential so that, additionally, effective collaboration -- e.g., between public and private sector sequencing facilities, academic universities, and bioinformatics expert groups -- ensures that generated data are of good quality and can be used in a meaningful way.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (69 617), Brazil (57 455), and France (22 731) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 8763 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 19 Feb 2021 to late 20 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (8 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Italy (14 931), India (14 315), Russia (12 963), Czech Republic (11 268), and the UK (10 406). A total of 48 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 23 of the 45 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and one is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 10.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 15.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 28.8% decrease in daily reported cases and 30.5% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: Similar to previous assessments, the global daily reported cases totaled over 400 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 111.64 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.47 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, even in the face of overall decreasing reports. - Mod.UBA]
