Summary
-------
Through a national surveillance system for unexplained pneumonia, a severe case of influenza A(H7N9) in a man in his mid-30s was identified in Zhejiang Province, China on 14 Oct 2013. Epidemiological and clinical findings were consistent with the patterns reported during the outbreak in spring 2013, and laboratory findings showed that the virus had 99.6 per cent identity with earlier H7N9 viruses identified in humans in the spring except for 5 mutations in the NA gene.

Introduction
------------
Since 2004, all hospitals from the 11 cities of Zhejiang Province have participated in enhanced surveillance throughout the year of patients with pneumonia without explanation. On 14 Oct 2013, this system identified a new case of human infection with influenza A(H7N9). Here we describe how the case was discovered, and report the epidemiological, clinical and virological characteristics compared with the previous laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) cases in Zhejiang Province.

Since the 1st case was confirmed on 31 Mar 2013, a total of 135 human infections with avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported in China, including 45 deaths. They occurred mainly in eastern China during March and June [2013], with the peak incidence in April [2013]. After the last case with illness onset on 28 Jul 2013 in Guangdong Province in the south of China, no further influenza A(H7N9) cases were reported in China until 14 Oct 2013.

In Zhejiang, a province neighbouring Shanghai, the influenza season usually lasts throughout the year, with a peak between November and February. In 2013, it was one of the areas most affected by the spring outbreak of influenza A(H7N9) during April. A total of 46 confirmed cases, including 11 fatal cases, occurred in 5 of the 11 cities (with more than 3 000 000 inhabitants) in Zhejiang Province; 11 of the 46 cases were clustered with 4 live poultry markets. The decrease in the number of new human cases since mid-April may have resulted from containment measures taken by the Zhejiang authorities, such as closing live bird markets, or from a change in seasons, or a combination of both factors. Until 14 Oct 2013, no confirmed cases had been reported in Zhejiang Province since 18 Apr 2013. The public health response in the province had ended on 17 May 2013.

Case description
----------------
A male case in his mid-30s was diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) virus in Shaoxing city on 14 Oct 2013. His illness began on 7 Oct 2013. The patient had no smoking history, and had no occupational exposure to poultry. He has been living in Shaoxing city for 7 years, sharing with one colleague a dormitory located 1 km [about 0.6 mile] away from his daily workplace. The dormitory is located in a village where free-range chickens are kept. The patient did not report any contact with patients with influenza-like illness or visits to live-bird and animal markets within 10 days of illness onset except that he travelled to a neighbouring city on 2-3 Oct 2013 and ate cooked chicken on 6 Oct 2013.

Illness began with influenza-like symptoms; including cough and 40.5 C fever on 7 Oct 2013. The patient consulted a township hospital twice, on 8 and 9 Oct 2013. He was 1st admitted to the township hospital on the morning of 11 Oct 2013 and then transferred to Shaoxing municipality hospital because of progressive dyspnoea and shortness of breath. At midnight on 11 Oct 2013, his condition deteriorated and he was transferred to the intensive care unit. The patient was reported to Zhejiang CDC as a suspected influenza A(H7N9) case on 14 Oct 2013. One throat swab was collected on 14 Oct 2013 and tested positive for influenza A(H7N9) with real-time PCR on the same day. The government announced the case on 15 Oct 2013.

[Interested readers should consult the original text via the source URL to view the clinical characteristics.]

The case had 25 close contacts, including 21 healthcare workers, one sibling, one workplace colleague, one patient exposed in the same ward and one roommate in the dormitory. All contacts without clinical symptoms were negative for influenza A(H7N9) virus RNA by real-time RT-PCR performed on 15 Oct 2013 during the 1st 5 days of medical observation.

A total of 2 of the 9 environmental samples collected from the live poultry market and the secondary wholesale market were positive for influenza A, H7 and N9; the other 7 environmental samples remained negative for these 3 targets.

Phylogenetic analysis showed the A/Zhejiang/22/2013(H7N9) (ZJ/22) virus was in the same cluster with the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended A(H7N9) vaccine virus, A/Anhui/1/2013(H7N9).

The selected characteristic amino acids of the ZJ/22 virus were similar to other H7N9 viruses, which included the mammalian-adaptive mutations previously reported, such as Q226L in the HA gene. The R294K mutation in the NA gene of H7N9 virus has been reported to confer reduced sensitivity to oseltamivir and to be related to the administration of antivirals. Our sample was collected before the patient received oseltamivir treatment, it remained R in position 294 of the NA gene. Interestingly, 5 amino acid mutations, V241I, K266E, N327T, N346D and K465R were detected in the NA gene that had not been identified in previous H7N9 viruses. The ZJ/22 viruses possessed 627E in the PB2 gene, which has been found in few of the human H7N9 isolates and all of the H7N9 isolates from avian or environmental samples. The D701N mutation in PB2 was not detected. However, the PB1 gene of ZJ/22 presented in a different cluster with the ZJ/20 virus that had previously been isolated from the confirmed case in Shaoxing city in April 2013.

Discussion
----------
We report here a severe case of laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) virus infection this winter in Zhejiang Province, identified through enhanced surveillance of pneumonia of unknown cause. The event shows that influenza A(H7N9) has returned 3 months after the last case had been confirmed in China in summer, and around 5 months since the spring outbreak in eastern China. It indicates a possible risk of a larger outbreak of influenza A(H7N9) this winter. The epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings in this case were similar to the previous cases in Zhejiang Province this spring, with no evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission. However, this case differed from the previous cases in that it was a younger severe case with no obvious underlying diseases and no obvious recent direct contact with live poultry. Most laboratory-confirmed cases in the past had been older patients over the age of 60 years reporting recent exposure to poultry, generally at live bird markets.

The surveillance system for unexplained pneumonia covering in all hospitals of Zhejiang Province was set up since 2004 ran routinely for 10 years. In 2013, following the confirmation of the 1st influenza A(H7N9) case on 1 Apr 2013, the surveillance system was expanded and strengthened, and one confirmed influenza A(H7N9) case was discovered through this system during the spring outbreak, but no further cases were discovered until 14 Oct 2013. This observation is consistent with seasonality of influenza A(H7N9) cases, much like human cases of influenza A(H5N1) in China that have mainly been occurring in the winter months.

The clinical features in this new case were similar to the cases reported in the spring in Zhejiang Province and other areas of China. They shared the acute onset and rapid development to severe and sustained hypoxia, accompanied by respiratory failure, ARDS, etc. Although the patient received broad-spectrum antibiotics, supportive management and mechanical ventilation, his condition deteriorated. Without underlying comorbid conditions or other risk factors, the case did not receive oral oseltamivir until 7 days after disease onset, which may have contributed to disease progression as early treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors can be effective.

Although no other influenza A(H7N9) outbreaks had been identified in animals in Shaoxing city before onset of the present case's illness and although he had no history of direct exposure to birds, the isolated virus had a high degree of similarity to H7N9 viruses previously reported in humans, with 98.5-99.6 per cent [homology]. Five mutations in the NA gene have never been reported in those strains isolated in spring 2013. The origin of these mutations is not clear, and any potential change in pathogenicity or transmissibility remains to be determined. In addition, positive PCR results were obtained in 2 of the 9 samples from live bird markets, which is consistent with continuing circulation of this virus in poultry and epidemic spillover leading to human cases. Within 10 days before his illness onset, the case had spent 2 days in a rural area, and wild animals cannot be excluded as a possible source, although the incubation period would then have been very long. If influenza A(H7N9) transmission continues in poultry, human infections may become more frequent when temperatures decrease in China this winter.

This study had some limitations: Firstly, we were unable to comprehensively investigate the exposure and travel history because the case has been unconscious in the intensive care unit since 11 Oct 2013. Secondly, medical observation of contacts is still ongoing without any positive findings to date. Thirdly, the H7N9-positive isolates from birds from the markets have not been sequenced because the viral load in the environment was too low. Finally, we have just begun a serological survey to identify subclinical infections among local residents associated with exposures in the affected live poultry markets and poultry farms.

Conclusion
----------
Human infection with influenza A(H7N9) virus has re-emerged in winter 2013, without substantial genetic change in the virus, signalling the potential for a new epidemic wave this winter. It is important to monitor the pandemic potential of this re-emerging virus which has apparently continued to circulate in an animal reservoir during the summer. Based on experiences in the spring, enhanced and expanded surveillance in the human and animal populations help to ensure early discovery and diagnosis of suspected cases, while hygiene campaigns and closure of live poultry markets can reduce the risk of severe cases and deaths. In particular, enhanced surveillance in poultry would be helpful if it can identify the H7N9 virus and inform early control measures before human infections occur. In the longer term, reformation of the poultry farming, distribution and purchasing system may be required to reduce human risk of infection with avian influenza viruses.

The epidemiological, clinical and laboratory findings in this case were similar to the previous cases in Zhejiang Province this spring, with no evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission. However, this case differed from the previous cases in that it was a younger severe case with no obvious underlying diseases and no obvious recent direct contact with live poultry.

[Note added in proof: A 2nd severe laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H7N9) case was identified on 23 Oct 2013 in Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province, while this manuscript was in production. The case is a man in his late 60s with no underlying disease who lived in a rural area and whose occupation included transporting and selling poultry.
