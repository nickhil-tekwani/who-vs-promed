The Arctic heat wave that sent Siberian temperatures soaring to around 100 deg F [37.8 deg C] on the 1st day of summer put an exclamation point on an astonishing transformation of the Arctic environment that's been underway for about 30 years.

As long ago as the 1890s, scientists predicted that increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to a warming planet, particularly in the Arctic, where the loss of reflective snow and sea ice would further warm the region. Climate models have consistently pointed to "Arctic amplification" emerging as greenhouse gas concentrations increase.

Well, Arctic amplification is now here in a big way. The Arctic is warming at roughly twice the rate of the globe as a whole. When extreme heat waves like this one strike, it stands out to everyone. Scientists are generally reluctant to say, "We told you so," but the record shows that we did.

As director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center and an Arctic climate scientist who first set foot in the far North in 1982, I've had a front-row seat to watch the transformation.

Arctic heat waves are happening more often
----------------------------------------
Arctic heat waves now arrive on top of an already warmer planet, so they're more frequent than they used to be.

Western Siberia recorded its hottest spring on record this year [2020], according to the EU's Copernicus Earth Observation Program, and that unusual heat isn't expected to end soon. The Arctic Climate Forum has forecast above-average temperatures across the majority of the Arctic through at least August [2020].

How heat waves get stuck
----------------------------
Why is this heat wave sticking around? No one has a full answer yet, but we can look at the weather patterns around it.

As a rule, heat waves are related to unusual jet stream patterns, and the Siberian heat wave is no different. A persistent northward swing of the jet stream has placed the area under what meteorologists call a "ridge." When the jet stream swings northward like this, it allows warmer air into the region, raising the surface temperature.

Some scientists expect rising global temperatures to influence the jet stream. The jet stream is driven by temperature contrasts. As the Arctic warms more quickly, these contrasts shrink, and the jet stream can slow. Is that what we're seeing right now? We don't yet know.

Swiss cheese sea ice and feedback loops
----------------------------------------
We do know that we're seeing significant effects from this heat wave, particularly in the early loss of sea ice.

The ice along the shores of Siberia has the appearance of Swiss cheese right now in satellite images, with big areas of open water that would normally still be covered. The sea ice extent in the Laptev Sea, north of Russia, is the lowest recorded for this time of year since satellite observations began.

The loss of sea ice also affects the temperature, creating a feedback loop. Earth's ice and snow cover reflect the Sun's incoming energy, helping to keep the region cool. When that reflective cover is gone, the dark ocean and land absorb the heat, further raising the surface temperature. Sea surface temperatures are already unusually high along parts of the Siberian Coast, and the warm ocean waters will lead to more melting.

The risks of thawing permafrost
---------------------------------
On land, a big concern is warming permafrost, the perennially frozen ground that underlies most Arctic terrain.

When permafrost thaws under homes and bridges, infrastructure can sink, tilt, and collapse. Alaskans have been contending with this for several years. Near Norilsk, Russia, thawing permafrost was blamed for an oil tank collapse this year [2020] that spilled thousands of tons of oil into a river.

In a study published last year [2019], researchers found that permafrost test sites around the world had warmed by nearly 0.5 deg F [0.3 deg C] on average over the decade from 2007 to 2016. The greatest increase was in Siberia, where some areas had warmed by 1.6 deg F [0.9 deg C]. The current Siberian heat wave, especially if it continues, will regionally exacerbate that permafrost warming and thawing.

Wildfires are back again
--------------------------
The extreme warmth also raises the risk of wildfires, which radically change the landscape in other ways.

Drier forests are more prone to fires, often from lightning strikes. When forests burn, the dark, exposed soil left behind can absorb more heat and hasten warming. We've seen a few years now of extreme forest fires across the Arctic. This year [2020], some scientists have speculated that some of the Siberian fires that broke out last year [2019] may have continued to burn through the winter in peat bogs and reemerged.

A disturbing pattern
---------------------
The Siberian heat wave and its impacts will doubtless be widely studied. There will certainly be those eager to dismiss the event as just the result of an unusual persistent weather pattern.

Caution must always be exercised about reading too much into a single event: heat waves happen. But this is part of a disturbing pattern.

What is happening in the Arctic is very real and should serve as a warning to everyone who cares about the future of the planet as we know it.

A Siberian heatwave that has seen temperatures hit 100.4 deg F (38 deg C) in one Arctic town is a "warning sign of major proportions," climate scientists have said. Thermometers in the town of Verkhoyansk in Russia's Sakha Republic reached a peak of 32 deg F (18 deg C) above the normal level for this time of year on 20 Jun 2020.

The World Meteorological Organisation is looking to verify the temperature reading, which would be a new record high for the region within the Arctic Circle. Siberia's increasing temperatures have been linked to the wildfires that grow bigger and more severe every year, as well as thawing of the permafrost.

Siberia's increasing temperatures have been linked to the wildfires that grow bigger and more severe every year, as well as thawing of the permafrost.

"The Arctic is figuratively and literally on fire," said University of Michigan climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck. "It's warming much faster than we thought it would in response to rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and this warming is leading to a rapid meltdown and increase in wildfires. The record warming in Siberia is a warning sign of major proportions."

Unseasonable warmth has been felt across much of Siberia this year [2020], averaging around 14.4 deg F (8 deg C) above average in the central-north region between January and May [2020], the climate science non-profit organisation Berkeley Earth has reported. "That's much, much warmer than it's ever been over that region in that period of time," said Berkeley Earth climate scientist Zeke Hausfather.

Siberia is in the Guinness Book of World Records for its extreme temperatures -- being a place where thermometer readings across the year can vary by as much as 190.8 deg F (106 deg C) -- with a record low of -90.4 deg F (-68 deg C) to the high of 100.4 deg F (38 deg C). Prolonged Siberian warmth as recorded at present has not been seen for thousands of years and "is another sign that the Arctic amplifies global warming even more than we thought," said Professor Overpeck. Russia's Arctic regions are among the fastest warming parts of the world.

Globally, the Earth's surface temperature has been growing by around 0.32 deg F (0.18 deg C) every 10 years on average over the past few decades, said Moscow's Voeikov Main Geophysical Observatory director Andrei Kiselyov. In Russia, however, the average temperature has increased by 0.85 deg F (0.47 deg C) every decade, a figure that increases to 1.24 deg F (0.69 deg C) when considering the Russian Arctic alone. "In that respect, we're ahead of the whole planet," Dr Kiselyov added.

Thawing permafrost is a huge problem in Siberia, as such provides the foundations for many buildings and pipelines. Furthermore, its loss also releases more heat-trapping gases and dries out the soil, increasing the risk of wildfires, explained environmental scientist Vladimir Romanovsky of the University of Alaska Fairbanks. "In this case it's even more serious, because the previous winter was unusually warm," he explained. The permafrost thaws, ice melts, the soil subsides, and this can trigger a feedback loop that worsens permafrost thawing, which "cold winters can't stop," he added.

In May [2020], a catastrophic oil spill from a collapsed storage tank near the Arctic city of Norilsk was attributed in part to subsidence due to the melting permafrost. Back in 2011, part of a residential building in Yakutsk -- the Sakha Republic's biggest city -- collapsed when the thawing ground underneath it destabilised. Furthermore, last August [2019], more than 4 million hectares of forest in Siberia were on fire, according to Greenpeace.

The director of the group's Russian wing, Vladimir Chuprov, has also warned that the fires started raging much earlier this year [2020], as they normally begin only in July.

Persistently warm weather, especially when such is coupled with wildfires, causes permafrost to thaw faster than usual, said University of Alaska Fairbanks ecologist Katey Walter Anthony. This, in turn, exacerbates global warming by releasing large amounts of methane -- a greenhouse gas 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide -- she added. "Methane escaping from permafrost thaw sites enters the atmosphere and circulates around the globe," she explained. "Methane that originates in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. It has global ramifications."

In the summer, unusual warming lessens the temperature and pressure differences between the Arctic and the lower latitudes where more people live, said climatologist Judah Cohen of the US-based Atmospheric Environmental Research. This, he explained, seems to weaken and sometimes even stall the jet stream, meaning that weather systems such as those bringing extreme heat or rain can remain fixed over places for days on end.

According to Russian meteorologists, a combination of factors contributed to the recent spike in Siberian temperatures, including the presence of a high-pressure system, a clear sky with a high sun, long daylight hours, and the short, warm nights. "The ground surface heats up intensively. The nights are very warm; the air doesn't have time to cool and continues to heat up for several days," explained meteorologist Marina Makarova of the Russian federal service for environmental monitoring. The temperature in Verkhoyansk was abnormally high from 19-22 Jun [2020], she added.

Scientists agree that the spike is indicative of a much bigger global warming trend. "The key point is that the climate is changing, and global temperatures are warming," concluded the UK's Copernicus Climate Change Service expert Freja Vamborg. "We will be breaking more and more records as we go."

[This heating is a complex event, and I strongly advise that members access the 2 articles presented above. There are some excellent figures of the extent and spatial distribution of this heating. And it is occurring not just in Siberia, but also in Alaska and across northern Canada. At the moment, the accounts are of climate and geophysical changes. Shortly, we can expect to see accounts of biological changes affecting insects, wildlife, plants, and humans co-inhabiting these heated regions. Raised summer temperatures have a negative effect on innate resistance, and thereby lower infective doses of pathogens will take their toll on both humans and animals. And we should not forget that, thanks to the COVID-19 plague afflicting us and its negative impact on normal medical services, children will be under-vaccinated. It is going to be a rough summer in the Arctic. - Mod.MHJ]

[The changes in climate we are experiencing as global warming, disturbance in precipitation regimes, and extreme weather events, are a threat to global health, especially at some regions such as the arctic pole. Rises in temperature may have an impact on the health of wild animals, with resulting deleterious impacts on major human interests. Climate change may affect wildlife health in several ways because the determinants of disease incidence are numerous and specific to the disease in question and climate change may influence each of these factors. Moreover, the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on host-pathogen interactions might favor some host species because they could release hosts from the population control exerted by pathogens by interfering with the precise conditions required for pathogen viability (either directly or indirectly; i.e., changes in vector abundance) and shift host population regulation to other factors, such as food or other resource availability. It is important to recognize that the components of a dynamically functioning ecosystem are interconnected; thus, the influence of climate change on animal distribution, abundance, or demography via infectious disease may be indirect due to shifts in relationships such as competitive advantages among conspecifics, predator-prey dynamics, and so forth. Monitoring wildlife health might provide an effective and sensitive indicator and predictor of climate-related emerging infectious diseases.
