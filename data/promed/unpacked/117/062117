I would like to introduce a report about natural and experimental infection
in cats with fowl plague virus (H7N7). The report was published in 1942 in
the Japanese Journal of Veterinary Science, Vol. 4, on page 511-523. The
original paper was written in Japanese, whereas the abstract was written in
English.
The following is the abstract of the report.
***
On the fowl-pest infection in cat:
Junji Nakamura and Taakeshi Iwasa. (From the Government Institute for
Veterinary Research. Fusan, Chosen. Director: Dr. I. Isayama).
A cat, which had been kept in the laboratory for the purpose of controlling
wild rats in the food store-cottage, developed severe nervous symptoms one
day and died after an acute course on the 3rd day.
Some observations and experiments were made with this cat; the results are
summarized as follows.
(1) In the morbid anatomy of the cat, no clear lesions were found. In the
histological study (made by Mr. K. Fukusho), severe nonsuppurative
meningo-encephalomyelitis was confirmed. Bacteriological examinations of
the organs were negative.
(2) Fresh emulsions of the cat's liver and spleen were inoculated into mice
(intracerebrally), fowls (intramuscularly), and developing eggs (on
chorio-allantoic membrane). The results were completely negative.The brain
emulsion was inoculated into 2 rabbits (i.c.), 2 guinea pigs (i.c.), 5 mice
(i.c.) 4 fowl (i.c. and i.m.), and 5 developing eggs ( on c.a.m.), of which
1 mouse, 1 fowl (i.m.), and 2 eggs died. The virus transfer experiments
from these carcasses were further carried out on the same animal species as
the first generation.
The results were remarkable: all the inoculated animals, i.e., 10 mice, 4
fowl, and 6 eggs died in 3-7 days, 40-65 hours, and 40 hours, respectively,
and revealed lesions indistinguishable from those of animals that had died
of fowl-pest. Bacteriological examinations were again negative. Further
transfers of the causative virus were easily continued in fowls and eggs.
(3) On the spleen virus obtained from the 3rd-generation fowl, neutralizing
effects of hyperimmune fowl-pest fowl serum, hyperimmune Chosen disease
(Newcastle disease) fowl serum, and normal fowl serum were compared. The
results showed that the fowl-pest serum was strongly active on this
isolated virus, while the other sera were completely inactive.
In the control experiment, in which Chosen disease virus was used for the
substitution of the cat virus, the chosen disease serum alone proved
strongly effective.
Thus the cat virus was specifically neutralized by the anti-fowl-pest
serum. Judging from the above results, the authors believe that the cat
died of a natural infection with fowl-pest virus. The per os infection of
healthy cats with fowl-pest virus was attempted. The results are summarized
as follows.
(1) All of the 4 cats fed with Chiba strains, i.e. 2 with infected mice and
the other 2 with infected fowl organs, developed distinct nervous symptoms
and died in 7~13 days after feeding, except one, which recovered after
several days.
Histological examinations proved encephalomyelitis in 2 cases and myelitis
in the other. In each of the dead cats, virus was recovered from brain, but
not from the spleen and liver. The lung was virulent in only one case.
(2) Each of the 2 cats fed with Doerr strain, i.e., infected fowl organs,
died 7 days after feeding. They did not reveal distinct nervous symptoms
nor inflammatory changes in the brain and spinal cord. In one of the cats,
however, fresh emulsions of spleen plus liver as well as the lung were
found to contain enough virus to infect test fowls and mice. The virus
search in the other cat resulted negatively.
(3) Organs of fowls infected with the Fukuda strain, were given to 2 cats.
One of them developed general symptoms after a long incubation period (24
days) and died suddenly in 24 hours. Weak virus was recovered from the
brain, but not from the other organs. The other cat remained healthy.
The per os infection of the cat with fowl-pest virus thus proved to be
positive. The animal appears to have a comparatively strong susceptibility
to the virus.
In the original paper in Japanese, features of infection in the cat are
discussed.

The National Institute of Animal Health said Thursday that since mice can
be infected by the strain of bird flu virus that killed chickens in
Yamaguchi and Oita prefectures, so can humans.
Also on Thursday, health officials in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, said 9
game fowl found dead along a nearby river the previous day had been
incinerated before confirmation could be made on whether they, too, had
succumbed to bird flu.
Referring to its recent tests on the H5N1 strain of avian flu taken from
Yamaguchi chickens, the National Institute said, "With mouse infection
confirmed, we can't deny [the possibility of] infection to humans."
The birds that succumbed last weekend at a home in Oita had contracted the
same H5N1 strain, the institute added.
In 1997, the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain was confirmed to have infected
humans for the first time, in Hong Kong, affecting 18 people and killing 6.
But the institute said the lethality of the virus found in Yamaguchi is
about one 500 000th of the one in Hong Kong.
In the Yamaguchi outbreak, Japan's first case of avian influenza in 79
years, 34 000 chickens died from the flu or were slaughtered. No human
infection was reported.
The prefectural government and the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
Ministry concluded Wednesday that Yamaguchi is safe after a serious of
control measures.
Yamaguchi lifted a 38-day-old ban midnight Wednesday that prevented farmers
and residents from transporting chickens and eggs within a 30-km radius of
the chicken farm where the outbreak was confirmed on 12 Jan 2004.
In Oita and adjacent Kumamoto Prefecture, officials continued to check
poultry farms within a 30-km radius of a house where pet bantams contracted
the virus for further signs of the disease.
The transport of chickens and eggs in that area has been curtailed since
Tuesday.
The farm ministry confirmed a report submitted Wednesday by Oita officials
that they have completed the initial infection control measures in line
with a government manual. The restriction will be lifted 18 Mar 2004 at the
earliest if no new infections occur.
The home kept 13 bantam chickens and a duck. 7 of the bantams were found
dead between Saturday and Monday, and tests confirmed that 2 of them had
been infected with bird flu. 6 others were slaughtered for testing.
Experts suspect the duck caught the virus from the house's pond and then
passed it on to the bantams. Waterfowl can carry the virus in their intestines.
Prefectural officials tested the duck's blood and confirmed indications of
its infection. But the test only indicates whether a bird had a history of
infection and not if it actually had the virus at the time of the test.
The officials incinerated the duck before actually testing for the virus,
causing a possible problem in tracking the infection route.
The officials inspected the bantams' droppings and disinfected the pond and
ditches in the house's yard where the duck was being raised. The owner had
allowed the bantams to mingle in the same yard as the duck, which was found
at a nearby river.
