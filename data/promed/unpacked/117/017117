Bad malaria pills raise resistance fears in Africa
--------------------------------------------------
High rates of the most effective type of
malaria-fighting drugs sold in 3 African
countries are poor quality -- including nearly
half the pills sampled in Senegal -- raising
fears of increased drug resistance that could
wipe out the last weapon left to battle a disease
that kills 1 million people each year, according
to a US report released Monday [8 Feb 2010].
Between 16 percent and 40 percent of
artemisinin-based drugs sold in Senegal,
Madagascar, and Uganda failed quality testing,
including having impurities or not containing
enough active ingredient, the survey found.

Artemisinin-based drugs are the only affordable
treatment for malaria left in the global medicine
cabinet. Other drugs have already lost
effectiveness due to resistance, which builds
when not enough medicine is taken to kill all of
the mosquito-transmitted parasites. If
artemisinin-based drugs stop working, there is no
good replacement and experts worry many people could die.

"It is worrisome that almost all of the
poor-quality data that was obtained was a result
of inadequate amounts of active (ingredients) or
the presence of impurities in the product," said
Patrick Lukulay, director of a nongovernmental US
Pharmacopeia program funded by the US government,
which conducted the survey. "This is a disturbing trend that came to light."

The study is the 1st part of a 10-country
examination of antimalarials in Africa by the US
and the World Health Organization (WHO). It
follows evidence from the Thai-Cambodian border
that artemisinin-based drugs there are taking
longer to cure malaria patients, the 1st sign of drug resistance.

The 3-country report also found bad drugs in both
the public and private health sectors, meaning
governments -- some buying medicines with donor
funds -- are not doing enough to keep
poor-quality pills out. All of the drugs tested
from the public sector in Uganda, however, passed
the quality tests. But 40 percent of the
artemisinin-based drugs in Senegal failed.

"There are countries where donated medicines are
not subjected to quality controls, they're just
accepted," said Lukulay. "There are countries in
Africa where Chinese products have been donated
and found to be unacceptable later in the public sector."

A total of 444 samples of artemisinin-based
combination drugs along with the antimalarial
sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine -- to which resistance
has already developed -- were 1st screened
locally using visual inspection and basic lab
tests. Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine is still used,
mainly for preventative treatment for pregnant women.

Nearly 200 samples then underwent full quality
control testing in a US laboratory to examine the
amount of active ingredient present and drug
purity. For both drugs, 44 percent from Senegal
failed the full quality testing, followed by 30
percent from Madagascar and 26 percent from Uganda.

While the study is not the 1st to assess the
quality of antimalarials in Africa, it is the
most rigorous and complete. Similar failure rates
were found in previous work, but those did not
focus specifically on artemisinin-based drugs.

"I am alarmed by these results because it means
there are many cases of malaria that are being
only partially treated, and that just guarantees
acceleration of artemisinin drug resistance,"
said Rachel Nugent, deputy director for Global
Health at the Center for Global Development, a US
think tank. "It is the most comprehensive study
out there on antimalarials and should be a
wake-up call." Nugent was not involved in the study.

[The problems with substandard drugs or even
counterfeit drug is receiving increased attention
and is most probably one of the most important
factors driving the development of resistance to
antimalarial drugs. See for instance this study:
Bate R et al. Antimalarial drug quality in the
most severely malarious parts of Africa - a six
country study. PLoS One. 2008;3(5):e2132.

The new data suggest that quality control in
mandatory in each country and using thin layer
chromatography has been suggested to be easy and
reliable in countries without access to HPLC
(high pressure liquid chromatography) (Ioset &
Kaur. Simple field assays to check quality of
current artemisinin-based antimalarial
combination formulations. PLoS One. 2009,30;4(9):e7270).

The recent development of artemisinin resistance
at the Thai-Cambodia border is also believed to
be driven by substandard formulations.

ProMED suggested in December 2009 (Malaria,
artemisinin resistance - SE Asia
(02) 20091230.4386) that counterfeit drugs and
under-dosing can only be dealt with in
resource-poor countries by providing malaria
treatment free of charge, just as anti-HIV
treatment is provided free of charge
(Schlagenhauf P and Petersen E. Antimalaria drug
resistance: the mono-combi-counterfeit triangle.
Expert Rev Anti Infect Ther. 2009;7:1039-42).
