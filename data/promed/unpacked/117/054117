More cases of African swine fever [ASF] have been confirmed, this time in Quezon City.

Speaking to CNN Philippines Saturday [14 Sep 2019], Quezon City mayor Joy Belmonte said, "I wanted to call (a meeting) today because I wanted to make decisions right away pertaining to this issue, but it's a weekend. But having said that, I did get to communicate with our city [veterinarian] ... I have been able to verify ... there are 3 pigs that have been found in a creek in Barangay* Bagong Silangan; it has now been verified that there are 11 mortalities already in Barangay Bagong Silangan, and they have been tested positive for African swine fever ... that's one barangay." [*A barangay is the smallest administrative division in the Philippines and is the native Filipino term for a village, district or ward.]

Belmonte added she also received reports of dead pigs in Barangay Payatas, but did not know how many there were. "Two barangays, I think, have been verified to have positive ASF," she said.

The mayor clarified piggeries are not allowed in Quezon City, as zoning laws do not provide for agricultural zones. She said she has already given orders to close these down; however, given these are backyard industries and [she] did not want families to suffer from loss of income, she gave them a "few months" to comply.

Belmonte said given the developments, they will have to act "more swiftly." "If there are validated cases, within a one-kilometer [0.62 mi] radius, all pigs within that radius must be culled," she said, adding around 2500 pigs from Barangay Bagong Silangan and Payatas will be affected.

[2] Preventive measures in Negros Occidental
Date: Mon 16 Sep 2019 (Manila time)

The provincial government of Negros Occidental has banned for 90 days the entry of live hogs, pork meat and pork products from Luzon, where cases of the highly contagious African swine fever (ASF) have been confirmed.

Gov. Eugenio Jose Lacson approved Resolution 19-05 passed by the provincial ASF's task force. The body recommended the temporary ban that covers pork and pork products originating from, processed or manufactured in Luzon.

"The governor will issue a memorandum addressed to me and to all municipal and city mayors for the implementation of Resolution No. 5," Renante Decena, provincial veterinarian, said.

Last week [8-14 Sep 2019], the Department of Agriculture (DA) officially confirmed that ASF was the cause of swine deaths in the provinces of Rizal and Bulacan [both in Luzon, eastern and northern to Manila, respectively] last month [August 2019].

Lacson appealed to travelers not to bring pork products from any area in Luzon to Negros Occidental.

In enforcing the prohibition, the task force underscored the "pressing need to protect the swine population of the province from being infected with the dreaded ASF disease in particular, and the PHP 6 billion [USD 115.5 million] provincial swine industry in general."

"Pork and pork products from these provinces, whether fresh, processed or canned may carry directly ASF viruses, which would introduce the disease into Negros Occidental," the task force said.

Figures from the Provincial Veterinary Office (PVO) showed that Negros Occidental's annual swine production is 510 000 heads. The province is the country's top backyard hog producer.

Lacson has directed the task force to carry out ASF prevention and control measures, enhance biosecurity practices in all ports of entry and swine production facilities, and coordinate and cooperate with the appropriate national government agencies in case of a suspected outbreak.

The ASF task force also urged operators and owners of hotels, resorts and restaurants in the province to refrain from throwing out food wastes or leftovers that can be used for swine feeding.

On Sunday [15 Sep 2019], Agriculture Secretary William Dar appealed to backyard hog raisers [throughout the Philippines] to report sick and dead pigs to their respective municipal or city veterinarians to prevent the spread of animal diseases, including the dreaded ASF.

He urged all swine raisers to allow the veterinary officers to undertake the safety measures, who will in turn coordinate with the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) to determine the cause of sickness or death.

Dar made the appeal over the discovery of dead pigs along Marikina River and a creek in Quezon City [in Luzon]. "It was utterly irresponsible on the part of the backyard raisers, as they did not only violate current laws, but their [wrongdoing] also spread the disease pathogens much faster," he said.

He warned that those who irresponsibly [dumped] the dead pigs could be punished under the law. Dar said sickly animals deserve proper care and adequate treatment. If they die, owners have to observe strict protocols on the disposal of carcasses.

"The Department of Agriculture [DA], through the BAI and the National Meat Inspection Service, in partnership with the private sector, particularly with commercial hog raisers' groups, local government units, the PNP (Philippine National Police) and military, has taken all the necessary measures to manage, control and contain the possible spread of ASF and major swine diseases," the DA chief said.

"The irresponsible dumping of dead pigs simply adds [fear] to the public, and this should not be tolerated. The perpetrators must be punished in accordance with the law," he added.

Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Teodoro on Sunday [15 Sep 2019] said the city government would file charges against those who dumped dead pigs in the river.

[ASF virus may have spread widely during the 5 weeks that elapsed between being initially suspected in Luzon (5 Jul 2019) and the date of its eventual confirmation, 30 Aug 2019. The efforts to prevent its spread from Luzon to other regions, divided by sea (such as Negros Occidental, in the northwestern half of the large island of Negros), are commendable. Unfortunately, their chances of success are arguable in view of the structure of the pig industry, the extremely high number of smallholders with backyard husbandry, and swill feeding.

The Philippines is an archipelagic country that consists of about 7641 islands that are categorized broadly under 3 main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao. The province Negros Occidental, mentioned above, is situated within the Western Visayas (see map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines#Administrative_divisions).
