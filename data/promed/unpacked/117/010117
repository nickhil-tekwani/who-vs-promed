The Nicaraguan Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Mag-For), through its
Division of National Agricultural Quarantine, has declared a state of
animal sanitary alert along the northern border of the country to prevent
the introduction of Venezuelan equine encephalitis [VEE].
According to a report from the Regional International Organization of Plant
Protection and Animal Health (OIRSA), approximately 10 days ago, the VEE
virus caused the death of 20 horses in the community of San Antonio de
Flores, in the Honduran state of El Paraiso, which borders the state of
Nueva Segovia, in the north of Nicaragua.
Reymundo Pastrana, of Mag-For's Quarantine Division, confirmed that upon
receipt of this information, the ministry's representatives at the border
station of Las Manos, Nueva Segovia, received orders to ban the
introduction of equines into Nicaragua.
The only animals to be permitted in the country are those whose owners can
present a health certificate confirming the absence of the disease or the
respective vaccination. The restrictions are in effect in all the border
crossings in the north of the country.
Alicia Arroliga, Director of Press Relations for Mag-For, reported that a
team of veterinarians from the Ministry has investigated the communities
along the border with Honduras and coordinated with health authorities in
Nueva Segovia the permanent surveillance of the area. Blood samples from
all ill horses in the region were analyzed and the initial results ruled
out the presence of VEE. The team also instructed residents about the
disease -- both in horses and in humans -- and urged the residents of
communities where there is no border control to refrain from traveling by
horse between the two countries, while the state of alert remains in effect.
The Ministry announced that this week the team of veterinarians would carry
out a second investigation to confirm or rule out the presence of VEE in
Nicaragua.

[Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE) viruses, of the genus Alphavirus
of the family Togaviridae, cause disease ranging from mild febrile
reactions to fatal encephalitic zoonoses in Equidae and humans. They are
transmitted by haematophagous insects.
Incidence of the disease has been reported during 2001 by Colombia, Costa
Rica, Guatemala, and Honduras. Nicaragua did not submit to the OIE a report
on the situation there during 2001, though it reported cases in 2000. The
last occurrence of VEE in Venezuela was reported in April 2000; during
2001, about 150 000 equines were vaccinated there. Further information on
the current dynamics of this important zoonotic disease in central America
will be welcome. - Mod.AS]
