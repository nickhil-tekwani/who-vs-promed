Within about 5 days, a mass death of home birds has been observed in 50
families of the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) residing in the Garatepe
village of Barda district of Azerbaijan. The IDPs are concerned that the
mass death is caused by the "bird flu" virus, Trend Regional Correspondent
reports.

Although the IDPs held the vaccination of the birds, as yet there are no
results. They have repeatedly appealed to the Barda Veterinary Department,
but no measures have been taken.

The State Veterinary Service of Azerbaijan refuted the information regarding
the mass death of the home birds in the Garatepe village of Barda. At
present the mass death of the home birds has not been noted in the regions,
including Barda, the Head of the Republic Expedition against Epizootic of
the State Veterinary Service, Rafik Muradov, informed Trend.

He stressed that on 22 Nov 2006, he had a conversation with the chief
physician of the district on this issue and it transpired that there are no
threats of the virus in existence. "As present it is possible to observe the
results of death of the birds, and it is not caused by "bird flu". All
regions, including Barda, have received all the necessary medication against
the threat of "bird flu"," he concluded.

It should be mentioned that the State Veterinary Service completed the next
monitoring on spread of virus in the territory of the country, and no bird
death cases were noted. The concluding laboratory results will be announced
on 27 Nov 2006.

[Barda's location can be seen at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/AJ/11/Barda.html>. Despite the opening
statement of the 2nd report, both reports provide some indication that birds
have died in unusual amounts. There is some degree of confusion, however, as
to the cause of death and whether it is being properly investigated.
Furthermore, we are given little reason to believe that the deaths are not
due to bird flu, other than the chief physician's statement as reported by
the Head of the Republic Expedition against Epizootic of the State
Veterinary Service.

Suffice it to say that the classic principles and steps of effective risk
communication are clearly lacking here. This is particularly unfortunate
because there were considerable efforts put forth in February and March of
2006 to investigate clusters of human avian influenza secondary to a wild
bird die-off.

The results due on the 27 Nov 2006, may or may not clear up the question.
Therefore, any definitive information would be appreciated. - Mod.PC]
