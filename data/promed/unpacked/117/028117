Epidemics Delay Start Of Romanian School Year
---------------------------------------------
Outbreaks of meningitis and conjunctivitis forced authorities in
parts of Romania to delay the start of the school year on
Wednesday. Schools remained shut in Bucharest and 6 of
Romania's 41 counties, mostly in the north and east, to allow the
epidemics to subside.
About 2000 cases of conjunctivitis have been identified in Bucharest.

_Streptococcus_), adenoviruses, picornaviruses or _Chlamydia_.
We hope to hear what the diagnosis is soon - Mod.JW
