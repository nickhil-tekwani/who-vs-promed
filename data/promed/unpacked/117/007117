Foot and mouth disease [FMD] has reappeared and infected 177
buffaloes, cows and pigs in [4] communes [Cu Dong, Kiet Son, Lai Dong
and Dong Son, situated in the district of] Thanh Son, within the
province Phu Tho. [This was announced by the] Province's Animal
Health Department.
The northern province has tightened measures to prevent and control
the disease, including spraying disinfectants in vulnerable areas and
setting up checkpoints to ban the transport of cattle from
disease-affected areas.
Other measures involve providing vaccinations for cattle and
disseminating information on the prevention and control of FMD.

[An interactive administrative map of Viet Nam is available at
<http://www.vnbd.com/maps/province-select-1.html>. Phu Tho province
is situated at the centre of north Vietnam; its districts can be seen
by clicking the province.
Viet Nam's last FMD update to the OIE was sent on 24 May 2006
(archived as 20060530.1510). It included information on the evolution
of a massive FMD epizootic: FMDV serotype O was reported to affect
cattle, buffaloes and swine in 330 communes, situated in 114
districts within 32 provinces; see at
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_17.HTM#Sec7>. Phu Tho (1 district,
2 communes) was among the infected provinces. In addition, FMDV of
serotype Asia 1 reportedly infected the same animal species in 19
communes situated in 6 districts within the province of Ha Giang; see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_17.HTM#Sec6>.
Since May 2006, the disease remained active, but the number of
affected provinces allegedly decreased. In mid-December 2006, the
media, citing the Department of Animal Health reported outbreaks in 7
provinces: Cao Bang, Tuyen Quang and Lang Son in the north, Lam Dong
in the Central Highlands, and Hau Giang, Soc Trang and Tien Giang in
the south. Phu Tho was not included among them. On 30 Dec 2006, a
Vietnamese newswire said that 5 provinces were still affected. (see
20061231.3664).
In the absence of an official report since May 2006, the FMD
situation in Viet Nam remains unclear. This refers both to its
geography as well as to its epidemiology, including the identity
(serotypes) of the circulating virus. - Mod.AS]
