Rats and moles are at the root of UPs [Uttar Pradesh] encephalitis problem, according to a UP health department document. Citing researchers from Indian Council of Medical Research, National Institute of Virology and BRD Medical College, Gorakhpur, the health document said that over 60 percent of the encephalitis cases in UP were caused by an infection called scrub typhus.

The problem is being addressed by Yogi Adityanath [Indian monk and Hindu nationalist politician who is the current Chief Minister (CM) of Uttar Pradesh] government in its strategy to beat encephalitis. "Scrub typhus is caused by mites living in the ear of rodents like rats and moles. The presence of this infection was confirmed in over 60 percent of cases over a period of 3 years," said V Hekali Zhimomi [‭Secretary Health Department Uttar Pradesh] ‬adding, "scrub causing mites also live in certain shrubs."‬

Stating that encephalitis due to scrub typhus was preventable, she said that the state government has rolled out a plan to beat the mites. "Encephalitis prevention has to be a multi-point strategy. So, agriculture and animal husbandry departments would play a role in rodent control while panchyati raj department would work to mitigate the issue of shrubs," she said.

On [Mon 5 Feb 2018], a detailed behaviour change and communication strategy to beat encephalitis was also rolled out by the state government in the presence of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. Called Dastak, the plan includes knocking at the door of each house to create awareness on the issue of encephalitis so as to minimise time wasted at the doorsteps of quacks and faith healers. This is for times that Unicef is getting associated with the drive to check encephalitis in the state.

"No child should die of encephalitis. We are strengthening the health systems to increase treatment capacities and offer the highest quality of care but equally important is creating awareness for prevention, control and timely detection of encephalitis cases can be done," said CM Adityanath on the occasion.

Unicef's communication for development specialist Bhai Shelly said that health messages would be disseminated in the language of the people. "Bhojpuri jingles and radio spots and informative films have been developed to help people understand the seriousness of the matter in their own language," he said.

A survey conducted by Path for UP health department showed that quacks and faith healers served as the 1st treatment point for over 50 percent of the encephalitis inflicted children. "So, by the time a child reaches a health facility, valuable time for life saving intervention is wasted," admitted health officials.

[Scrub typhus has been found to be responsible for acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in 63 percent of patients admitted to a hospital in northeastern Uttar Pradesh state (1). Similarly, a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases (2), which ProMED-mail posted (3), indicated that the scrub typhus may account for a significant proportion of acute encephalitis syndrome in the northeastern Indian state of Assam. Scrub typhus could also account for many cases of acute encephalitis in other Indian states (4)

However, I noted at the time in the moderator comments (3) that although headache is a common part of the symptom complex of scrub typhus, acute encephalitis or meningoencephalitis, with a history of altered sensorium, seizures or neck stiffness, and abnormal neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid findings, complicates a minority of scrub typhus cases (5-7).

Please also see prior ProMED-mail posts that have discussed the occurrence of acute encephalitis complicating scrub typhus (Acute encephalitis syndrome - India (03): (UP) comment 20151011.3707371 and Acute encephalitis syndrome - India (02): (UP) 20151008.3698951).

Uttar Pradesh is a state in northern India; with over 200 million residents, it is the most populous state in the India (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uttar_Pradesh). Uttar Pradesh has a humid subtropical climate with 4 seasons: the winter in January and February is followed by summer (pre-monsoon) between March and May, the monsoon season between June and September, and the post-monsoon (northeast monsoon) between October and December. Lucknow, with a population of 2.8 million residents in 2011, is the capital and largest city in Uttar Pradesh (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucknow). - Mod.ML

Reliable and timely laboratory support in hospitals and private clinics attending these encephalitis cases is critical in order to obtain a reliable diagnosis. Although scrub typhus may be responsible for many cases categorized as acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), other etiological agents have been implicated in the past. The determination of the etiology or etiologies of AES has been confusing and elusive. AES has been attributed to a variety of etiologies, including Reye syndrome-like disease, possible enterovirus infection from polluted water, heat stroke, scrub typhus (_Orientia tsutsugamushi_), and lychee fruit consumption. Japanese encephalitis virus infections have been shown to be responsible for some of these cases. Prospective studies should help to rule out or include these etiologies. - Mod.TY
