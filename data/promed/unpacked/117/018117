There is an outbreak of a deadly dog disease. Your dog could get it, just by sniffing. At 1 veterinary hospital, half the dogs that tested positive have died. Here is what to look out for.

Ms P's dog, Oliver, is lucky to be alive. "It was a long road for him, but he's back in action now," she says. That, after 9 days of hospitalization for a disease called leptospirosis. It is a bacteria carried by wildlife like rats and passed in urine; so, it ends up in puddles and cracks on the sidewalk.[It is also carried by other dogs and spread the same way. - Mod.TG]

"If a dog is to lick that up or have some on their paw and lick their paw, they can get the bacteria into their system," MedVet criticalist Dr. Jayme Hoffberg says. At MedVet Chicago, 15 dogs have been diagnosed since June. That is considered a major spike. "The thing that's also made this year a bit different is that these have been really sick cases," Hoffberg says. Only half survived. But this 24-hour emergency clinic does see the most severe cases.

Some dogs show no signs. But like Oliver, many will experience vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy - and, when it's really serious, a lack of urination and kidney failure. It got so bad for Oliver his owners were considering euthanasia. "Something in us wanted to keep trying, and so we did and every day he got a little better, thanks to the amazing vets," Ms. P says.

She doesn't thinks dogs should become shut-ins, but she is urging awareness and annual vaccinations. There's no guarantee your dog won't get sick, but it could save their life. "We're so happy just to have him back. We call him our little miracle dog," she says.

This is contagious to humans, who can get many of the same symptoms. Good hygiene is critical. Whether in humans or animals, the disease is treated with antibiotics. But it can be a long road for pets. And it can cost big bucks.

[Leptospirosis vaccine used to be combined into a core vaccine that was recommended for dogs. Then around 10 or more years ago, because of the possibility of a reaction in some animals, a decision was made to remove leptospirosis from the combination vaccine. As a result, we have an entirely naive population of dogs so we should expect to see more cases. About 3 years ago a new vaccine was released for leptospirosis.

With an increase in cases, an increase in reporting, and a new vaccine, why are veterinarians not using it, or why are clients declining the vaccine for their animals?

Leptospirosis (lepto for short) is a serious bacterial disease of dogs, multiple animal species and humans that occurs in countries around the world. In the United States, it has become an increasing concern in recent years, especially in cities and suburbs. The main reason is growing populations of wildlife, like raccoons and skunks, which carry the disease and infect dogs indirectly. Dogs can get sick even if they never come into direct contact with infected animals.

Lepto has been diagnosed in all types of dogs and all breeds and sizes are at risk. It can be a very serious disease and can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated early. It generally attacks a dog's liver and kidneys, and can lead to organ damage or failure. But if caught early, it responds well to antibiotics, and fortunately, vaccination can help prevent the disease.

Leptospirosis is caused by the bacterium _Leptospira interrogans_, part of a group of corkscrew-shaped bacteria called spirochetes. Leptospira spirochetes are further divided into multiple "subfamilies" called serovars or strains. Around the world, there are more than 200 serovars of leptospira. Although there are many serovars, only a few are known to cause disease in dogs. Newer vaccines contain 4 serovars for protection against today's most common serovars. Those 4 serovars and the most common hosts are listed below.

Lepto serovars are maintained in nature by "reservoir hosts" that have subclinical infections and shed the organisms for long periods of time. Dogs can be reservoir hosts for the serovar Canicola. Many academics consider Canicola the least frequently isolated serovar in dogs. Dogs are "incidental hosts" and generally develop more severe clinical disease for serovars Grippotyphosa, Pomona, and Icterohaemorrhagiae.

_L. interrogans_ Grippotyphosa hosts: raccoon, skunk, opossum, small rodents, and squirrels. Currently most common and increasing; leading infectious cause of acute renal failure in dogs.
_L. interrogans_ Pomona hosts: skunk, raccoon, opossum, cow, pig, and deer. Currently common and increasing; leading infectious cause of acute renal failure in dogs.
_L. interrogans_ Icterohaemorrhagiae hosts: rat and pig. Traditionally common and decreasing, possibly due to widespread vaccination containing this serovar; can cause severe liver disease and jaundice. _L. interrogans_ Canicola host: dog. Traditionally common and decreasing, possibly due to widespread vaccination containing this serovar; can cause severe liver disease and jaundice.

All mammals appear to be susceptible to at least one species of _Leptospira_. Disease is rare in cats, and less common in sheep than cattle.
Serovars associated with disease in cattle include _hardjo_, _pomona_, _grippotyphosa_, _canicola_, and _icterohaemorrhagiae_.
Serovars associated with disease in sheep and goats include _hardjo_, _pomona_, _grippotyphosa_, and _ballum_.
Serovars associated with disease in pigs include _pomona_, _grippotyphosa_, _bratislava_, _canicola_, _icterohaemorrhagiae_, _tarassovi_, and _muenchen_.
Serovars associated with disease in horses include _hardjo_, _pomona_, _canicola_, _icterohaemorrhagiae_, and _sejroe_.
Serovars associated with disease in dogs include _pomona_, _grippotyphosa_, _canicola_, _icterohaemorrhagiae_, _pyrogenes_, _paidjan_, _tarassovi_, _ballum_, and _bratislava_.

The primary reservoir hosts for most _Leptospira_ serovars are wild mammals, particularly rodents. Reservoir hosts among domestic animals include cattle, pigs, sheep, and dogs. The specific reservoir host(s) varies with the serovar and the geographic region. Disease in reservoir hosts is more likely to be asymptomatic, mild, or chronic. Reservoir hosts include:

- rats: serogroups _icterohaemorrhagiae_ and _ballum_
- mice: serogroup _ballum_
- cattle: serovars _hardjo_, _grippotyphosa_, and _pomona_
- sheep: serovars _hardjo_ and _pomona_
- pigs: serovars _pomona_, _tarassovi_, and _bratislava_
- dogs: serovars _canicola_ and _bataviae_.

This is a diverse group of serovars affecting a variety of animals, and humans. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease and in many states is a reportable disease to the state animal health association or veterinarian when it is diagnosed in a dog. The human-animal bond may increase the likelihood of an exposure to a human being.

While knowing the serovars may help in some regions, it may not in other regions. It may in some cases helpful to determine the source: the local pond, or an encounter with a pig.

Leptospirosis can be transmitted either directly between hosts or indirectly in the environment. _Leptospira_ spp. can be ingested in contaminated food or water, spread in aerosolized urine or water, or transmitted by direct contact with the skin. The organisms usually enter the body through mucous membranes or abraded skin. They may also be able to penetrate intact skin that has been immersed for a long time in water. _Leptospira_ spp. are excreted in the urine, and can be found in aborted or stillborn fetuses, as well as in normal fetuses or vaginal discharges after calving. They can be isolated from the male reproductive organs. Human cases have also been transmitted during sexual intercourse, by breast feeding, from rodent bites, and after laboratory accidents.

_Leptospira_ spp. do not multiply outside the host. In the environment, they require high humidity for survival and are killed by dehydration or temperatures greater than 50 deg C (122 deg F). They can remain viable from a few to many weeks or months in contaminated soil and for several weeks in cattle slurry. They can remain viable in water for several months under laboratory conditions, but do not survive as well in river water under natural conditions.

The clinical signs and severity of disease are highly variable in dogs. Some infections are asymptomatic or mild, while others are severe or fatal. The initial signs are usually nonspecific and may include fever, depression, anorexia, stiffness, myalgia, shivering, and weakness. The mucus membranes are often injected. These signs may be followed by signs of kidney disease including anuria, hematuria, or increased frequency of urination, vomiting, dehydration, and oral ulceration. Abortions, diarrhea, gray stools, coughing, dyspnea, conjunctivitis, weight loss, and jaundice may also be seen. Hemorrhagic syndromes occur in some dogs: the mucus membranes may have widespread petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages and, in later stages of the disease, there may be hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and epistaxis. Some dogs die peracutely without clinical signs. Chronic kidney disease can be a sequela. Chronic infections may be asymptomatic, or associated with fever of unknown origin and conjunctivitis.

_Leptospira_ may be found in the blood, milk, and cerebrospinal, thoracic, or peritoneal fluids. During chronic infections, they are sometimes found in the urine. The liver, lung, brain, and kidney are collected at necropsy from acute cases, and the kidney and genital tract are tested in chronic cases. Organisms can also be found in the body fluids or tissues of aborted fetuses.

Antibiotics used to treat leptospirosis include the tetracyclines, penicillin/ampicillin, dihydrostreptomycin, streptomycin, and the fluoroquinolones. The efficacy of treatment may depend on the serovar. Fluid therapy, blood transfusions, and other supportive care may also be necessary.

Control of this organism may depend upon sanitation and disinfection of the area. _Leptospira_ species can be inactivated by 1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 70 percent ethanol, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, detergents, and acid. This organism is sensitive to moist heat (121 deg C/250 deg F for a minimum of 15 minutes) and is also killed by pasteurization. Preventing contact with likely carriers of the organism may be the best prevention. The vaccine is, as the article pointed out, useful and helpful in controlling/preventing the disease.
