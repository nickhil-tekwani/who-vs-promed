Since the end of 2005, isolates of multidrug resistant _Klebsiella
pneumoniae_ began to appear in various hospitals across Israel,
affecting more than 500 patients annually. Most isolates appear to be
of the same strain by pulsed field electrophoresis and are resistant
to a wide spectrum of antibiotics including the penicillins,
cephalosporins, beta-lactamase inhibitors, quinolones, and
aminoglycosides. They are resistant to the carbapenems, and are
sensitive only to colistin, gentamicin, and some to tigecycline. In
some cases, resistance to colistin and gentamicin has developed
during treatment. The majority of patients have multiple
co-morbidities with long hospitalization. It has been estimated that
the crude case-fatality rate of the patients is in excess of 30
percent. However, since most of the patients have serious underlying
illness, the attributable mortality due to the
antimicrobial-resistant _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ is not yet known.

[My native New York City has a very large community of Jews with a
fair amount of travel between the city and Israel. Some of the travel
involves hospital health care delivery of New Yorkers in Israel and
Israelis in New York. New York City also has significant problems
with poly- and even pan-resistant Gram-negative bacilli including
_Klebsiella pneumoniae_. Comparison of the Israeli outbreak strain
with those from New York City and other places in the USA and other
countries may assist in assessing the source of the bacillus.
The term "drug problem" is often used in relation with illicit drug
use, although it may also refer to issues of inability to obtain
appropriate medications such as antiretroviral medications in the
developing world.
"Drug problem," however, can also be used to relate to the impressive
upsurge in the number of bacteria displaying antimicrobial
sensitivity profiles, which provide few therapeutic options. These
organisms in the lay press are often dubbed "super bugs." Not only
are more bacteria developing hard-core resistance patterns (including
_Staphylococcus aureus_, _Enterococcus sp._, _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_, and a host of Gram-negative bacilli like _K.
pneumoniae_), but also their overall numbers are increasing,
especially in the hospital setting. This contributes to longer
hospital stays, increased hospital costs and increased morbidity and mortality.
This post is another example of our ride down the slippery slope
towards what some have called the "post-antibiotic era." Modern
medicine has not yet frequently trod into the "pre-antibiotic era,"
when physicians stood by the bedside, put a cool cloth on the
febrile, dying patient's forehead and told the soon-to-be-grieving
family that "we're doing everything we can." We may not, however, be
far from this. Efforts are being made to slow down the ride into
potential oblivion by increasing use of more common sense and
prudence in the utilization of antimicrobials, by institution of
strictly enforced infection control practices in health care
facilities (particularly hand washing before and after each patient
contact) and by the development of new, uniquely active antimicrobial
compounds by the pharmaceutical industry.
As a clinician who deals with issues of antimicrobial use, misuse,
and resistance on a daily basis, I hope for the best. - Mod.LL]
