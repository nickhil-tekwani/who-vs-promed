The culling of some 1.04 million chickens at a farm in Ibaraki Prefecture has begun, after the 1st avian flu cases this season in east Japan's Kanto region around Tokyo have been confirmed. The Ibaraki Prefectural Government announced on 4 Nov 2022 that many chickens had died at a poultry farm in the city of Kasumigaura and that a genetic test confirmed they were infected with the highly pathogenic avian flu. The prefectural government received a report from the farm on 3 Nov 2022 and performed a simple test, whose result came back positive the following day [4 Nov 2022]. The prefecture has imposed restrictions on 27 poultry farms within a 10-kilometer radius of the affected farm. Ibaraki Prefecture is the largest egg producer in Japan.

[Japan's 1st HPAI H5N1 outbreaks of the 2022-2023 season were confirmed at chicken farms on 28 Oct 2022, starting earlier than usual. It was the 1st time for a bird flu outbreak to occur at any farm in the country before November. The previous 1st-in-season record took place during the 2020-2021 season, when the 1st outbreak was confirmed on 5 Nov 2020.

Japan has submitted to the WOAH an immediate notification of its recurrent HPAI H5N1 event (No. 4689) on 1 Nov 2022 and a follow-up report (FUR 1) on 4 Nov 2022. Combined, outbreaks were reported from 3 locations: Kannonji-city (Kagawa prefecture), Atsuma-town (Yufutsu District, Hokkaido), and Kurashiki-city (Okayama prefecture; a city on Japan's Seto Inland Sea).

FUR 1, including a map presenting the foci, is available at https://tinyurl.com/b3w3u25c. It included the following epidemiological comments, relating to case 3: "On 31 Oct 2022, a Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (LHSC) in Kagawa prefecture received a notification from a domestic laying hen farm of an increase in the number of dead birds. Samples were collected from dead birds in the farm by prefectural veterinary officers and tested positive for influenza A virus by viral antigen rapid test. On 1 Nov 2022, the LHSC conducted RT-PCR and RRT-PCR tests and confirmed that the subtype was H5. On 2 Nov 2022, the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH) conducted the sequencing and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N1 and the causative virus was determined as high pathogenicity avian influenza. On the same day (2 Nov 2022), stamping-out was completed. Movement restriction and shipment restriction are imposed on farms within a radius of 3 km and 10 km of the affected farms, respectively."

The current event in Ibaraki, affecting layers, is yet to be officially reported.

This year's avian influenza season had an early start also in South Korea, Japan's regional neighbour. On 19 Oct 2022, HPAI H5N1 was confirmed at a duck farm, for the 1st time in about 6 months. The outbreak started on 16 Oct 2022 in the southeastern county of Yecheon and was followed by additional outbreaks on poultry farms in the same county (20221026.8706376). Yecheon is about 450 km distant, as the crow flies, from Okayama. - Mod.AS
