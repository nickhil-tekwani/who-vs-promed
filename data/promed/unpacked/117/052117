The number of African swine fever [ASF] cases here in Korea keeps going up with 13 [outbreaks] confirmed so far. Following the traces of the virus being found in a dead wild boar near the demilitarized zone [DMZ], the military has ordered the troops guarding the border to shoot any wild pigs they see in the area.

A suspected new case of ASF has been reported on Incheon's Baekryeong-do Island on Friday [4 Oct 2019]. This comes after the 13th [outbreak] of the disease was confirmed on Thursday [3 Oct 2019] at a pig farm in Gimpo, west of Seoul.

Authorities are working [hard] to stop the animal disease from spreading. South Korea's prime minister, Lee Nak-yon, during a meeting on Friday morning [4 Oct 2019] at the National Disaster and Safety Status Control Center, stressed the need for better management of the outbreak. "African swine fever has spread in Paju, Gimpo, and Yeoncheon. We must look back on the past handlings and check if there was adequate management of those cases," Lee said.

The Agriculture Ministry also decided to extend the 48-hour standstill on transporting pigs. "To strengthen quarantine efforts near the inter-Korean border areas, the ministry has decided to extend the movement ban on pigs previously issued for Incheon, Gyeonggi-do province, and Gangwon-do province by another 48 hours, starting from 3:30 a.m. Friday [4 Oct 2019]." The ministry will cull all pigs within a 3 km [1.9 mi] radius of the infected farms in Gimpo and Paju. For the pigs outside that radius, the government will buy the pigs off the farmers. The pigs will then be sent to slaughterhouses where they will be tested before the meat is sold. But in order to do this, farmers must register application forms for purchase to the respective cities in advance.

For the 1st time on record, the virus has been discovered in a wild boar as well. Traces of the ASF virus were found in a dead wild boar found near the DMZ in Yeoncheon, just 1.4 km [0.9 mi] away from the southern limit line of the DMZ. There is a possibility the wild boar could have originated from North Korea, where an ASF outbreak was reported in May [2019]. Because of this, South Korea's military on Friday [4 Oct 2019] ordered troops at the border to shoot any wild pig crossing the DMZ.

[In a later report, it was announced that the military has launched a week-long quarantine operation over the skies of the demilitarized zone. Helicopters will be used to disinfect DMZ areas, starting in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi-do province, for 7 days starting Friday [4 Oct 2019].

The ministry has ensured they've informed North Korea of this new measure, flying helicopters to spray disinfectant while ordering border guards to shoot any wild pigs they see in the area (https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x7m5pj5). - Mod.AS]

Quarantine authorities still do not know how African swine fever (ASF) has spread here, because no clear vectors for the disease's spread have been found in confirmed cases. Not knowing the cause is making it more difficult to take preventive measures.

When ASF was confirmed in South Korea in mid-September [2019], the authorities suspected a virus spread via wild boars from North Korea, where the deadly virus reportedly has been rampant.

But experts said boars would be unlikely to enter the South after breaking through barbed wire in the demilitarized zone (DMZ). Also, boars found in the south side of the DMZ tested negative for the virus. [But see the more recent data in item 1 above. - Mod.AS]

Another suspicion was that the virus was transmitted via water in the Imjin River, which flows from the North to the South toward the Han River. The 9 farms here where ASF was confirmed are close to the river. But 20 water samples from the Imjin and Han rivers tested negative.

Some other vectors include using leftover food for pigs, or farm workers visiting countries where ASF is spread. But none of the confirmed cases had these factors.

Now some people suspect cats living in the wild could have spread the virus after coming in contact with infected animals or eating the remains of infected animals, and then following nearby rivers. All the contaminated pig farms are around 2-3 km [1.2-1.9 mi] from rivers.

A confirmed ASF case at a pig farm on Seokmo Island in Ganghwa, Incheon, fuels the speculation that wildlife such as rats or cats could have spread the virus. Only one bridge connects the island with other regions, the farm had only 2 pigs, and no outside cars visited there, according to quarantine authorities.

Many experts say the situation is similar to the avian influenza virus that swept through the country in 2016. The virus was spread to secluded areas including Yeongcheon, Gimpo, and Ganghwa.

There was no proof that cats were involved in spreading the bird flu virus, but in December 2016, the remains of 2 stray cats discovered in Pocheon, Gyeonggi province, were found to have the H5N6 virus.

Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon also said last week that there could be other unknown ways of spreading the virus. "The current quarantine system could be missing something," Lee said at a meeting with government officials. "For example, the virus could be spread through underground water, or via flies or small winged animals, and in such cases the current system cannot prevent the spread."

[Since the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed the 1st ASF outbreak in South Korea on 17 Sep 2019, affecting domestic pigs in Cheongnyongdu-gil, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-Do (about 5 km [3.2 mi] from the border; map at https://tinyurl.com/yxcxqvr5), a total of 13 ASF outbreaks have been reported in Gyeonggi-do (9) and Incheon City (4). The latest was confirmed on Thu 3 Oct 2019 in Gimpo City, Gyeonggi-do.

On 2 Oct 2019, a dead wild boar was found in the demilitarized zone, at about 1.4 km [0.9 mi] north of the southern limit line, and tested positive for ASF virus. This finding may be viewed as indicative of the source and, most likely, route of ASF introduced. The virus is suspected to have become widely spread in North Korea since its penetration, most likely from China, earlier this year [2019] (initially reported in May 2019; no further reporting; 20190530.6494781).

The disease in South Korea has remained, so far, limited to a region along the border, northwest to Seoul, namely in Paju, Gimpo, and Yeoncheon. An interactive OIE map, presenting the locations of the 1st 9 outbreaks, is available at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=31778 (click on the cluster to center, zoom in).

In relation to ASF spread by wild boar, the separation of an ASF outbreak by water bodies from the mainland or, on the mainland, by rivers from other territories, has become recently a matter for some discussion. Wild boar have good swimming and jumping capacities. Observations of wild boar swimming across large rivers and off coastlines have been documented. The ASF incubation period is reported to be 4-19 days in naturally acquired cases. This may allow incubating animals to reach water-separated territories by swimming. - Mod.AS
