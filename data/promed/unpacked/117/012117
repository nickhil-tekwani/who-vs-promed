Re: Cowpox virus and rats
--------------------------
Regarding the moderators' observation that this disease affected pet =20
rats and not wild ones, if you look at the picture that ran with the =20
Czech news item, you will note that it is one of a pouched rat, an =20
African species popular as pets, not _Rattus norvegicus_ or even _R. =20
rattus_, the native European rat [see ProMED-mail post "Cowpox, =20
rodents, human - Germany, France ex Czech Rep. 20090225.0786" and =20
<http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/news/zpravy/czech-vets-say-german-french-cowpox-n=

ot-from-czech-rats-press/362344>].

This doesn't mean the infection necessarily came from that species, as =20
it was probably a stock photo. The original German epidemiology report
<http://www.rki.de/cln_100/nn_1378492/DE/Content/Infekt/EpidBull/Archiv/2009

/06__09,templateId=3Draw,property=3DpublicationFile.pdf/06_09.pdf>
does not clearly identify the species of "Schmuseratte" kept as pets =20
by the 2 families that developed orthopox infections, although it does =20
say the common European rat, _Rattus norvegicus_, was sold by the pet =20
shop involved at the time, so presumably it was that. But I recall =20
that an outbreak of another orthopox virus, monkeypox, in the US in =20
2003 was traced to pet prairie dogs, which caught the virus from =20
pouched rats at pet dealers (see:
<http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17823991.500-monkeypox-is-latest-dise

ase-to-reach-america.html> and ProMED-mail 2003 post below).

The German report mentions only that a PCR for "orthopox virus" was =20
positive, followed by a diagnosis of cowpox -- were tests done that =20
would rule out monkeypox? It might be worth finding out whether the =20
breeder who was the source of the infected rats also handled pouched =20
rats at the same time.

It's not that I wish to knock pouched rats, as I "adopted" one of =20
these guys for my father-in-law for Christmas: =20
<http://www.herorat.org/>. His sniffs out land mines, but they have =20
also trained some to diagnose TB.

[Could turn out to be true -- if so, a great bit of deduction, =20
Sherlock Deb! Confirmation or otherwise from our Czech & German =20
readers eagerly awaited. - Mod.JW]
