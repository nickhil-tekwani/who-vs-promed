[1] Northern Ireland: ASF-contaminated sausage at airport

Traces of African swine fever (ASF) virus have been found in meat that was brought into Northern Ireland illegally by passengers in the month of June [2019].

In total, airport authorities seized over 300 kg [661 lb] of illegal meat in June [2019]. The Northern Irish Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) said a sample of these seizures was tested at the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI), resulting in the detection of ASF virus DNA fragments. A DAERA spokesman confirmed: "DNA fragments of ASF were detected in a sausage from Asia."

DAERA said that whilst this type of discovery in itself does not pose a significant threat to the animal health status of Northern Ireland, nor does it affect the disease-free status from ASF, it does reinforce the importance of the controls on personal imports of meat and dairy products enforced by DAERA officials.

DAERA chief veterinary officer Dr Robert Huey warned that it is illegal to bring certain food and plant products back into the country to avoid the risks of importing animal or plant disease. "I make no excuses for repeating this message," he said. "The greatest risk is to our agri-food industry and our environment, as any introduction of pests, diseases, and non-native species can have a potentially devastating impact."

DAERA warnings are clear at points of entry into Northern Ireland. They emphasise that meat and dairy products should not be brought into Northern Ireland in passenger's luggage, as such items may be seized by portal inspection branch staff at local ports and airports.

[The country of origin is not named; in the past, ASF-contaminated pork products found at several international airports were suspected to come from China. The hazard of ASF spread through contaminated pig products from other regions, including European, and also through sea and land routes should be taken into consideration; travellers should be alerted and measures intensified, worldwide. - Mod.AS]

[While ASF continues its march in southeast Asia, the situation on the European front, where wild boars are affected as well, is concerning as well. Bulgaria announced on Fri 12 Jul 2019 the confirmation of 2 new outbreaks near the country's border with Romania: one in a wild boar and the other one in domestic pigs (see https://tinyurl.com/y47q7u96). Earlier, on Mon 8 Jul 2019, ASF was reported from 5 villages, similarly close to the Romanian border, with 51 infected animals (https://tinyurl.com/y5ffe98n). In Northeastern Bulgaria there are 600 000 industrially kept pigs. In the summer season, there is an active tourist and agricultural activity, and the risk is increasing many times, commented the deputy minister of agriculture, associate professor Dr. Yanko Ivanov. He assured that compensation by law will be given to those who are properly registered; those who acted indiscriminately would not be compensated. (Thanks to Sabine Zentis and Susan Baekland for the above reports.)

The 2 new cases bring the total number of ASF outbreaks in Bulgaria, confirmed by the Food Safety Agency in July [2019], to 10.

On Wednesday, 10 Jul 2019, Bulgaria's government said that it has approved a BGN 3.7 million (USD 2.1 million) transfer to the agriculture ministry's budget for urgent measures aimed at preventing the spread of ASF in the country. - Mod.AS
