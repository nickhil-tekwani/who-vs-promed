Equine viral arteritis, United Kingdom
---------------------------
Information received on 1 Aug 2019 from Dr Christine Middlemiss, chief veterinary officer, DEFRA, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London, United Kingdom
Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 20 Jul 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 31 Jul 2019
Report date: 31 Jul 2019
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2019
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Equine arteritis virus [EAV]
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic and advanced)
This event pertains a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Shropshire, England
Date of start of the outbreak: 20 Jul 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 5 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Following a non-negative test, EVA infection was confirmed by 2 PCR tests and gene sequencing for a semen sample taken from a stallion located in Shropshire, North England. This is the only stallion located at the premises.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 20 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Following non-negative results for serology and semen testing, the only stallion at the premises tested positive on 2 PCR tests and gene sequencing. The stallion was last bred in March 2018 to mare on same premises; normal foal produced. The stallion has not been used for semen collection for AI or covered any mare since March 2018. The stallion's owner has confirmed intention to castrate. This mitigates the risk of onward spread through breeding. Gene sequencing confirmed this case is not related to the previous EVA positives in Dorset and Devon reported in April and May, respectively. Disease restrictions are to be maintained until investigations are complete.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: process to inactivate the pathogenic agent in products or by-products.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Animal and Plant Health Agency, Weybridge (national laboratory) / Equidae / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 31 Jul 2019 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Equine viral arteritis (EVA) is a contagious viral disease of equids caused by equine arteritis virus (EAV), an RNA virus classified in the genus _Arterivirus_, family Arteriviridae. Equine arteritis virus is found in horse populations in many countries worldwide. Although infrequently reported in the past, confirmed outbreaks of EVA appear to be on the increase.

According to the press release from Department for Environment Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) on 2 Aug 2019 (see https://www.gov.uk/government/news/equine-viral-arteritis-confirmed-in-shropshire), deputy chief veterinary officer Graeme Cooke said:

"We are taking action to limit the risk of the disease spreading by placing breeding and movement restrictions on the animal. A full investigation is continuing to consider the source and possible spread of the infection. Owners of mares and stallions are always urged as a routine to have their horses tested before they are used for breeding."

"These findings remind us that we must all be vigilant for signs of disease and how essential it is to follow strict biosecurity measures."

You can help prevent the disease spreading by
- following the Horserace Betting Levy Board Code of Practice [https://codes.hblb.org.uk/index.php/page/30],
- testing animals before they are used for breeding,
- considering vaccinating stallions against the disease (talk to your vet for advice), and
- practicing good biosecurity [https://tinyurl.com/y4gfog86] on your premises. - Mod.CRD
