Early this Friday [4 Nov 2022], health authorities and the Durango prosecutor's office searched and secured the Hospital del Parque in the city of Durango due to reports of cases of aseptic meningitis. In a joint proceeding, files, medications, and the facilities of the aforementioned hospital were secured, which was where most of the surgeries of the women who were victims of meningitis infection were performed.

The prosecutor's office integrated 5 investigation folders derived from various complaints for cases of the disease, so that within the investigations a search warrant was generated in conjunction with the state attorney general's office, through a control judge, the Ministry of Health of the state, through COPRISED.

The private hospital called Hospital del Parque is located on Camino de la Aurora Borealis, 109 in the Los Remedios subdivision in the city of Durango.

According to what was reported by the government authorities, the assurance will remain in force for the time necessary to carry out the corresponding inquiries.

The judicial procedure was carried out in the early hours of this Friday [4 Nov 2022] and fortunately there were no patients admitted to the hospital.

The positive cases of aseptic meningitis add up to 11 and there is one death confirmed by the authority; in addition, medications have been seized and surgical interventions involving the application of epidural anesthesia have been suspended in private hospitals in Durango.

It is worth mentioning that yesterday [3 Nov 2022] medication was seized in Durango as a probable cause of aseptic meningitis, alerting the authorities of Jalisco and Mexico City.

The alert for infections of aseptic meningitis in Durango has gained strength, given that the number of cases has risen to more than 10 women affected. Therefore, personnel from the Federal Commission for Protection against Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS) traveled to Durango, leading to the seizure of a suspicious medication.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), aseptic meningitis is the most common type of meningitis, so most people get better on their own without treatment. However, people who have symptoms of meningitis should see a doctor right away because some types can be very serious. Babies less than a month old and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to get seriously ill from viral meningitis.

Also according to the CDC, non-polio enteroviruses are the most common cause of meningitis. Other viruses that can cause meningitis include the following: mumps virus, herpes viruses, measles virus, influenza (flu) virus, arboviruses such as West Nile virus, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus.

[Durango City (pop., 654 876 in 2015) is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Durango, located in northwestern Mexico (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango_City).

The news report says that 11 patients have developed "aseptic meningitis" as a postoperative complication in Durango City in the Durango State of Mexico. "More than 80%" of the 11 patients (9 patients?) developed this complication at Hospital del Parque in Durango City. We are not told what other hospitals in Durango are involved. All the affected patients apparently are women who underwent some type(s) of surgeries that involved epidural anesthesia and use of a medication that has been seized by the investigating authorities.

Aseptic meningitis is a condition that causes inflammation in the tissues covering the brain and spinal cord, but routine bacterial cultures are negative. The most common causes of aseptic meningitis are viruses, but fungi, parasites, ameba and certain drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, can cause aseptic meningitis. Some drugs can cause meningeal irritation following direct exposure of the meninges following intrathecal administration (that is, administration directly into the cerebrospinal fluid), causing a "chemical" meningitis due to the drug itself or a chemical contaminant of the drug. Intrathecal administration can occur inadvertently during an epidural injection.

An epidural injection is delivery of a drug between the dura mater and the vertebral wall. Epidurals can be used during labor and childbirth, during and after some types of surgery, and to treat pain due to sciatica or a slipped disc. However, to have a cluster of chemical meningitis cases following inadvertent intrathecal administration following epidural anesthesia would be unusual. Another possibility is aseptic meningitis from a parameningeal infection due to epidural administration of a drug that is contaminated with bacteria or fungi, as occurred in patients in the large, multistate invasive fungal infection outbreak associated with contaminated methylprednisolone injections in late 2012 and 2013 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4669562/) and another fungal meningitis outbreak in 2002 (ProMED post Fungal meningitis, contaminated drug - USA (03) 20021212.6046).

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
