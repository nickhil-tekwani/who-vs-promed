Background information on primary amebic meningoencephalitis in Texas
-------------------------------------------------
Not to further muddy the waters, but Texas' 3 cases in 2001 had
(reported) exposure in 3 different bodies of water, although 2 were
residents of the same county (Dallas, 2002 pop. approx. 2.25
million). The 3 cases had onset of (fatal) illness 8-17 Aug 2001. A
highly suspect case in 2002 (confirmation [still] pending at CDC) had
exposure to the same body of water as did one of the 2001 cases. Over
the years several cases had exposure to multiple bodies of water
during a "reasonable" incubation period. The largest number of cases
recognized in a single year was 5 cases in 1995. The 24 Feb 1995
issue of California Morbidity, "Diseases Caused by Free-Living
Opportunistic Amebae" stated, "Opportunistic pathogens have been
isolated from naturally warm or thermally polluted waters and from
cysts carried on dust in the air." [reference: Lawande RV. Recovery
of soil amoebae from the air during the harmattan in Zaria, Nigeria.
Ann Trop Med Parasitol 1983; 77-45-9, which I have not read, and
whose title does not specifically identify _N. fowleri_]...also in
the _Naegleria fowleri_ section of the California Morbidity article,
it states "Other reported cases have resulted from washing with tap
water and from inhalation of cysts during dust storms." [Lots of
folks in Arizona are exposed to coccidioidomycosis thru wind-borne
dust.] October is later in the year than any of Texas' cases have had
onset of illness (the majority have been in July/August...one case
with onset in November had reported exposure in Guanajuato, Mexico).
