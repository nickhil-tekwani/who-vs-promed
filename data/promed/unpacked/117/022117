Summary of poliovirus circulation in 2016 - Pakistan 27 Dec 2016

In Pakistan, a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been detected from environmental samples in Quetta, Balochistan. Two isolates with apparent genetic linkages were isolated from environmental samples, collected on [20 Oct 2016 and 28 Nov 2016]. Virus was isolated from environmental samples only, and no associated cases of paralysis linked to the isolated strains have been detected in Quetta or anywhere else in the province.

Pakistan also continues to be affected by endemic transmission of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1). As of [21 Dec 2016], 19 WPV1 cases have been reported in 2016. It is the lowest number of annual cases ever reported, from the fewest number of affected areas in the country.

The majority of the polio cases during the last 6 months were reported from non-reservoir areas, i.e. from "tier 2, 3 and 4" districts (districts which are considered to be more vulnerable to polio re-infection). There have been no paralytic cases of wild poliovirus from the traditional polio reservoirs in Pakistan since February 2016.

Public Health Response
A response with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in the Quetta and neighbouring districts is now planned, in line with internationally-agreed protocols. The 1st campaign of a series of campaigns is planned for [2 Jan 2017]. In addition, the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination (MoHSRC), supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and other partners, is further strengthening active search for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) and conducting an in-depth field investigation to more clearly ascertain the circulation of this strain. Pakistan continues to implement the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication to urgently interrupt all remaining strains of polio transmission in the country.

The area affected by the reported type 2 virus is part of a transnational common reservoir for WPV1 that extends into Southern Afghanistan. Interrupting WPV1 transmission in this area remains the topmost priority of the federal, provincial and district health teams. Meticulous preparations are underway through the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) and District Polio Control Rooms for high quality implementation of upcoming back-to-back national and sub-national vaccination rounds, in December 2016, January 2017 and February 2017, using bivalent oral polio vaccine (bOPV). These campaigns are critical to addressing the remaining pockets of under-immunized populations sustaining low-intensity WPV1 transmission within the common reservoir.

To ensure high quality, preparations are focusing on allocating adequate resources to the highest-risk areas; tailoring operational plans to identified reasons for missed children; validating vaccination teams' microplans, vaccinator selection, training and supervision; and enhancing local engagement with communities through community leaders. In order to jointly address transmission across the common reservoir, close coordination is ongoing with Afghanistan teams at all levels.

WHO Risk Assessment
WHO assesses the risk of international spread of WPV1 within the common reservoir between Pakistan and Afghanistan to be high (due to the historical spread of such strains across the joint epidemiological block with Afghanistan). WHO also assesses the risk of spread of cVDPV2 within the common reservoir as medium to high. Risk of international spread of WPV1 or cVDPV2 to other countries is assessed low.

WHO Advice
It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases in order to rapidly detect any new virus importation and to facilitate a rapid response. Countries, territories and areas should also maintain uniformly high routine immunization coverage at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Residents (and visitors for more than 4 weeks) from infected areas should receive an additional dose of OPV or inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) within 4 weeks to 12 months of travel.

As per the advice of an Emergency Committee convened under the International Health Regulations (2005), efforts to limit the international spread of poliovirus remain a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). Countries affected by poliovirus transmission are subject to Temporary Recommendations. To comply with the Temporary Recommendations issued under the PHEIC, any country infected by poliovirus should declare the outbreak as a national public health emergency and consider vaccination of all international travellers. Any country that exports poliovirus should ensure vaccination of all international travellers before departure.

[With the earlier report on identification of positive environmental samples in Balochistan, we sent a request for information (RFI) through the EpiCore Surveillance Project network. At that time, we received a number of replies confirming the media report we had published and posted the replies in "Poliomyelitis update (19): Pakistan environmental samples, information 20161017.4566348." Subsequent to that post, EpiCore Surveillance Project member Dr Zaman Jamali <drzamanjamali@hotmail.com> sent additional environmental surveillance information:

On 22 Oct 2016: Environmental samples taken from Pishin on 2 and 16 Sep 2016 were positive and were linked with previous samples from Pishin.

On 31 Oct 2016: The environmental sample taken from Pishin Balochistan on 2 Oct 2016 was declared negative. SL1 [Sabin like type 1, VDPV1], SL3 [Sabin like type 3 - VDPV3] and EV [enterovirus] isolated.

On 8 Nov 2016: Environmental sample taken from Turwa district Pishin results announced as negative for WPV. SL1 and SL3 isolated.

The above report further highlights the continued isolation of poliovirus in environmental samples (most recently circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2), although not related to human disease in the areas from which the environmental samples are taken. The increase in surveillance activities along the Pakistan/Afghanistan border areas (in both countries) is ongoing to further confirm whether these environmental samples were not, as yet, associated with paralytic poliomyelitis in the affected areas (see section [3] below for more details).

cVDPV definition: see document "Reporting and classification of vaccine-derived polioviruses" at http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/VDPV_ReportingClassification.pdf.

Highlights of week:
- Summary of newly-reported viruses this week: from Pakistan - one new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case, and confirmation of a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2).

Afghanistan
- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 12. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Oct 2016], from Bermal district, Paktika province. Half of the country's cases this year [2016] are from Bermal district.

- No environmental WPV1 positive samples have been reported in 2016. The most recent WPV1 positive samples were collected on [27 Dec 2015] - one in Jalalabad district of Nangarhar province and the 2nd in the city of Kabul.

- Paktika province is close to the border with Pakistan, and constitutes a common WPV transmission corridor posing a major risk to both national programmes. This corridor of transmission ranges from southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP)/Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) in Pakistan to southeastern Afghanistan in Paktika, Paktya and Khost provinces. Efforts are ongoing to urgently strengthen operations, both for immunization and surveillance activities, in particular in these provinces.

Pakistan
One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week, from Badin district, southeast Sindh, with onset of paralysis on [10 Oct 2016]. This brings the total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 to 19.

- Additionally, a new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been confirmed from Quetta, Balochistan. Two genetically-related viruses were isolated from environmental samples, collected on [28 Nov 2016 and 20 Oct 2016]. It is important to note that virus was isolated from environmental samples only; no associated cases of paralysis have been detected by this strain.

- An outbreak response with monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in the affected area is now being planned, in response to the cVDPV2, in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols. The Ministry of Health, supported by the World Health Organization (WHO) and partners, is further strengthening active search for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and conducting an in-depth field investigation to more clearly ascertain the extent of circulation of this strain.

- Pakistan continues to implement the National Emergency Action Plan for polio eradication to urgently interrupt all remaining strains of polio transmission in the country. The majority of the polio cases detected during the last 6 months were reported from non-reservoir areas, i.e. from "tier 2, 3 and 4" districts (districts which are considered to be more vulnerable to polio re-infection or spread). There have been no paralytic cases of wild poliovirus from the traditional polio reservoirs in Pakistan since February 2016.

- Meticulous preparations are underway through the national and provincial Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) and District Polio Control Rooms for high quality implementation of January and February 2017 immunization campaigns, seen as critical to the country's polio eradication effort.

- To ensure high quality, preparations are focusing on allocating adequate resources to the highest-risk areas; tailoring operational plans to identified reasons for area-specific missed children; validating vaccination teams' microplans, vaccinator selection/training and supervision; and enhancing local-level engagement with communities and community leaders. Intense cross-border coordination is ongoing with Afghanistan to address the joint epidemiological transmission corridors affecting both countries.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016], from Monguno Local Government Area (LGA), Borno.

- Regional outbreak response in northeastern Nigeria continues to be implemented, both in response to the WPV1 cases detected in August [2016] and to the circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) isolates, detected in Borno from an environmental sample (collected in March [2016]) and a healthy contact of one of the WPV1 cases (collected in August [2016]).

- The emergency regional outbreak response is being implemented under the guidance of the polio eradication Emergency Operations Center (EOC), led by the Government of Nigeria and with support from WHO and GPEI partners. The outbreak response is being coordinated with neighbouring countries (see "Lake Chad Basin" update below) and in the context of the response to the broader humanitarian emergency affecting the region. Similar approaches to polio outbreak response were successfully implemented in previous years in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa.

Lake Chad Basin
- The recent detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (VDPV2) in Borno state, Nigeria poses a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin, and hence an outbreak response plan is being implemented as part of the response to the Nigeria outbreak.

- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.

Guinea and West Africa
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases have been reported from Guinea in 2016. The most recent case was reported from Kankan district with onset of paralysis on [14 Dec 2015]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2015 is 7.

- While signs are positive in Guinea, gaps remain sub-nationally both in population immunity and surveillance sensitivity. Undetected circulation cannot be ruled out. Efforts are continuing to rapidly fill these gaps and ensure the outbreak has been stopped.

Lao People's Democratic Republic
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type one (cVDPV1) were reported in the past week. The most recent case was reported in Fuang district of Vientiane province, with onset of paralysis on 11 Jan 2016. The total number of cVDPV1 cases remains 3 in 2016 and 8 in 2015.

- While no new cases have been detected since January [2015], subnational surveillance gaps persist and efforts to strengthen surveillance are, therefore, ongoing.

- Outbreaks of cVDPVs can arise in areas with low population immunity, emphasizing the importance of maintaining strong vaccination coverage.

Madagascar
- No cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) have been reported in 2016. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Aug 2015], from Sud-Ouest region. The total number of cVDPV1 cases for 2015 is 10.

[3] Pakistan-Afghanistan strategy
Date: 16 Dec 2016
Source: Polio Eradication Initiative, Innovation series [edited]
http://polioeradication.org/news-post/innovation-series-two-countries-one-team/


Innovation Series: 2 countries, one team
Afghanistan and Pakistan are proving that countries are stronger together in the fight to stop the poliovirus. The border between Pakistan and Afghanistan is no barrier to the poliovirus. Close cultural and linguistic ties connect the 2 countries. Populations move fluidly across these borders. Each year, the virus moves with them.

Afghanistan and Pakistan have seen significant progress in the last 18 months in their efforts to stop polio. But both countries have been close before, and have been thwarted: the virus has found pockets of unvaccinated children where it can hide, regroup, and stage a comeback. Despite historically low levels of polio over the last few months, cases of paralysis and positive samples found through environmental surveillance show us that the virus has not yet been stopped.

Armed with this knowledge, Pakistan and Afghanistan have taken a new approach. Since June 2015, the 2 have been coordinating major programme activities, as success in one country depends on success in the other. Monthly polio immunization campaigns have been synchronized so that no child on either side of the border can fall through the cracks, the Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs) of each country -- which house the government and partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to coordinate eradication activities -- interact with one another on a weekly basis, and the highest level political and administrative leadership meet face to face every 6 months to resolve challenges and to develop plans to address the remaining hurdles.

A common communications strategy has synchronized messaging at the border and -- with radio being the main source of news for 70% of Afghans and 50% of Pakistanis in border areas -- the programme has coordinated radio programming on the leading border channels, producing weekly health shows and using popular soap operas to create Pashto-language programming on polio and children's health.

This innovative approach is paying dividends. The polio eradication programmes in both countries are working closely together to coordinate vaccination campaigns, surveillance, and to track population movements.

[See source URL showing map of "The three 'corridors' of polio transmission" - Mod.MPP]

Three "corridors" are serving to allow the virus to travel with population movements between countries: via the Torkham border crossing from Peshawar and Khyber in Pakistan to Nangarhar, Kunar and Laghman in east Afghanistan, and via the Friendship Gate border crossing from Pakistan's Quetta Block to the Greater Kandahar area in south Afghanistan. Population immunity in these transmission corridors has been gradually improving in the last year, as shown by the vaccination status of non-polio AFP cases.

Wild polio increasingly seems to be travelling down a central corridor between southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas in Pakistan travelling across rugged, smaller border crossings to Paktika, Paktia and Khost provinces in the southeast of Afghanistan.

At the most recent Inter-Country Coordination Meeting in Islamabad, Pakistan, the Afghanistan National EOC Director underscored the importance of reaching and vaccinating populations on the move, whether at formal or informal locations.

While Torkham in the northwest and Friendship Gate in the south are the main border crossing points between the reservoirs -- with more than one million children under 5 crossing these points each year -- the smaller informal crossings are considerably more challenging to reach and vaccinate children.

Pakistan and Afghanistan are working to strengthen coordination on the communities moving through these locations, to ensure that all children under 5 are vaccinated wherever they are. The programmes are strengthening their disease surveillance at community level, mapping out mobile groups and ensuring they're included in immunization microplans, and working with leaders and influential figures to understand their movements better.

The new polio cases in the central corridor have reinforced the idea that neither Pakistan nor Afghanistan can eradicate polio alone, with the virus travelling between the 2. At the Islamabad meeting, the National EOC coordinator for Pakistan highlighted the fact that neither programme was where it intended to be by this time in 2016, and these strategies tailored to addressing specific challenges were essential to end the virus for good.

The significant improvements in the programme quality in the southern and eastern corridors can be attributed to a relentless focus on improving campaign quality and the innovative approach of the 2 countries working as one team across the border.

Pakistan and Afghanistan are learning from the programme's experiences in other countries. If this progress can be maintained in the traditional corridors between the long-time polio reservoirs, and the programme can move quickly to rapidly increase immunity in the new, central corridor, the programme has the opportunity to strike out polio in 2 countries with one blow, working together to ensure that no poliovirus can find a hiding place along the porous border between them.

[4] Nigeria response

http://polioeradication.org/news-post/launching-a-rapid-response-to-reach-nigerias-last-child/


Launching a rapid response to reach Nigeria's last child
--------------------
A humanitarian crisis
In August 2016, hundreds of thousands of people fled their homes in Borno State, northeastern Nigeria, where they had been living in areas under the control of the armed group Boko Haram. These areas had been inaccessible to any health programme, including polio vaccinators.

When health workers finally reached these families, they found thousands of severely malnourished children in need of treatment for a range of health conditions. They also found 4 children in 3 different locations within Borno paralyzed by polio. The virus had been spreading silently in these areas for the past 2 years, beyond the reach of the polio eradication programme.

The detection of polio in Nigeria was a serious setback for the polio eradication programme. With no cases detected in Nigeria or any other African country for 2 years, there was hope that Africa was polio-free.

The outbreak response was swift and comprehensive, with the Governments of Borno and Nigeria, the World Health Organization and UNICEF conducting an immediate emergency vaccination response.

From August [2016], health authorities conducted 5 large-scale supplementary vaccination campaigns targeting every accessible child under 5-years of age in Borno State. Campaigns were also aimed at children in the bordering states of Nigeria, as well as the Lake Chad region of Niger, Chad, Cameroon and the Central African Republic in synchronized activities to rapidly raise childhood immunity to the poliovirus and protect against inter-state and international spread. Approximately 11 million children are being targeted across the region.

Multiple strategies were employed to reach as many children as possible. Additional health workers were hired and trained, and detailed plans for each settlement and internally displaced persons camp were comprehensively reviewed to ensure all children were registered for immunization. Targeted media campaigns drew awareness to the upcoming vaccination campaigns. Health camps offered polio vaccination in addition to basic health care packages.

To accelerate community demand for vaccination, the Volunteer Community Mobilization Network was quickly scaled up to reach all highest-risk communities. These women, in their distinctive blue hijabs, move from house-to-house and through the internally displaced persons camps to ensure parents know about the risk of polio and the importance of full immunization for their children. Working for just a couple of dollars a day, they also connect pregnant women to available health services and encourage safe delivery practices, as well as identifying children with severe acute malnutrition and linking them to treatment facilities.

Health camps have been set up in areas with a high number of internally displaced persons to offer much-needed health services than polio vaccines alone. These include de-worming tablets, zinc, oral rehydration salts for children with diarrhea as well as other routine vaccinations for children who may never have had contact with a health system. Polio survivors help to educate parents at these camps to the dangers of the current outbreak and the fact that there is no cure for polio, but that it can be prevented through vaccination.

To access the hardest-to-reach populations in newly-accessible areas, the Government of Nigeria with support from the United Nations is using helicopters to deliver vaccines and other health services. UNICEF has procured and delivered more than 150 million doses of oral polio vaccine to this outbreak response. The work remains dangerous, with ongoing attacks and active fighting in some areas.

After having access to so little for so long, the demand for services has been overwhelming from affected communities. The provision of soap and other basic "pluses" has helped to meet some of these needs and encouraged mothers to bring their children out for vaccination.

With so much at stake, strong monitoring and supervision has been key to ensuring that as many children can be reached as possible. Wide-scale vaccination campaigns offering polio vaccination and other services will continue throughout the 1st quarter of 2017 in an effort to ensure that this outbreak is stopped and the world can finally achieve a polio-free Africa once and for all.

[The takeaway messages from the above reports re-confirm the challenges to achieving the goal of polio eradication, and highlight the massive efforts ongoing in the 3 remaining polio endemic countries: Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria. The positive message is the further reduction in reported polio cases, both WPV and cVDPV in 2016 compared with 2015.

The causes for concern are highlighted in Pakistan's experience with the isolation of polioviruses from environmental samples and the identification of 4 cases of WPV associated paralytic disease in Nigeria after 2 years with no cases detected, confirming ongoing undetected transmission of the virus in the area of civil strife. Unfortunately, there are more countries in Africa where there is ongoing civil strife, and one hopes that there isn't as yet undetected poliovirus transmission ongoing in these countries as well.
