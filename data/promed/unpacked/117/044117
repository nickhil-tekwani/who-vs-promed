In France, the fight against brucellosis is being expanded in the Savoy. Last week [24 - 30 Oct 2022], the Ministry of Agriculture presented an action plan to counteract the further spread of the bacterial disease.

Although France is officially considered to be free of brucellosis, wild ibexes act as a reservoir in the Savoy on the border with Italy and Switzerland. According to departmental information, there were outbreaks in cattle herds in the region in 2012 and 2021.

In order to prevent further cases as far as possible, according to the ministry, controls are being expanded, both in the herds and in wild animals. The state is also subsidizing a study to improve the detection options for the pathogen, including in milk and dairy products.

The action plan also includes measures to reduce the prevalence of the disease in the ibex population. According to the ministry, more than 170 animals were caught and 61 were removed in 2022. The networking of all actors involved is also to be improved, namely via working groups and a monitoring committee.

However, this should not have become any easier due to the inventory regulation that was carried out only recently. According to media reports, the 61 ibexes were shot shortly before a visit by Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau as part of a large-scale operation. The area was cordoned off by the gendarmerie for 2 days immediately after the prefect approved the shooting down, and a helicopter was also deployed.

As reported by Radio France, the prefect of the Haute-Savoie department had already issued a permit in March [2022], but this was overturned by the administrative court. According to the nature conservation umbrella organization France Nature Environnement (FNE), studies have shown that only about 4% of ibex are infected with brucellosis.

According to the ministry, the disease is highly contagious and can lead to miscarriages, fertility problems, or a drop in milk production in cattle and small ruminants, among other things. The disease can also be transmitted to humans through contact with or consumption of raw milk products. Reblochon, one of the most important cheese specialties in the country, is made in Savoy.

[The Alpine ibex (_Capra ibex_) is a species of wild goat that lives in the mountains of the European Alps. The species is currently listed as of least concern by the IUCN, but went through a population bottleneck. By the early 1800s, <100 animals survived in a single population in the Italian Gran Paradiso mountain massif. This has led to very low genetic diversity across populations.

The Alpine ibex population from Bargy and neighboring areas in France has undergone major outbreaks of brucellosis caused by _Brucella melitensis_. European wild ungulates were seen as dead-end hosts for this bacterium, as all previous outbreaks of brucellosis in wild populations disappeared spontaneously. The situation in Bargy is different and alarming since the disease has affected an unprecedentedly high proportion of the ibexes (38% in 2013). Brucellosis persisted at high levels in the following years despite intense culling of animals which led to the removal of 40% of the population.

Managing disease in wildlife can be extremely challenging. Culling wildlife as a control measure can lead to both decreases and increases in disease incidence. There is a need for detailed information about the wildlife-disease system involved, to finely tune the culling intensity, coverage, and duration needed to reduce disease incidence without seriously affecting the population dynamics of hosts (see: https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2018.0901).
