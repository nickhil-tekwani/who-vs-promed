Because of a thing called the "Feres Doctrine" under which the US
Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the Federal Government is not civily
liable for bad things that happen to active duty service members (since we
cover them under disability procedures.) I believe this also applies to
vendors who supply stuff, like vaccines, armor, airplanes, etc, that meets
DOD (US Dept of Defense) specifications. In other words, no multi-million
dollar settlements for soldiers who get bad reactions to immunizations.
(Dependents and retirees are another question to which I don't pretend
to know the answer.)
As usual, people who need a real legal opinion should get it from a
lawyer, not a pathologist. And if this note bears any resemblance to
official DOD policy, it is purely coincidence.

US military personnel lose their right to sue relating to medical treatment,
among other things, per what is called the 'Feres Doctrine'. It is based on
the concept of 'sovereign immunity'. Previous cases have not fared well
challenging the Feres Doctrine. Therefore, I think few attorneys (and
plaintiffs) would be willing to front the cost of further legal action.
Another important point regards the Federal Vaccine Act.
See:
Daniel A. Cantor, STRIKING A BALANCE BETWEEN PRODUCT
AVAILABILITY AND PRODUCT SAFETY:LESSONS FROM THE VACCINE ACT
The American University, Summer, 1995, 44 Am. U.L. Rev. 1853.
Federal law protects companies that make vaccines, under certain
circumstances, from product liability, because the risks are so
high and, well, we need the vaccines...
