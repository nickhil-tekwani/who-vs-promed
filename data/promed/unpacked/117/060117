Up to 20 people who underwent surgery with equipment used on patients with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) are being contacted today [19 Jul 2013] to warn them they need to be tested. Health chiefs revealed between 10 and 20 patients will be notified after the scare following treatment at Dublin's Beaumont Hospital. The Health Service Executive (HSE) confirmed last night [18 Jul 2013] that assessments are under way to see if any other patients have been put at risk of contracting the fatal degenerative brain disorder at the facility. Medical experts have been checking records to see how many people have been operated on in recent weeks with instruments which had been used on the affected patient. Dr Kevin Kelleher, the HSE's assistant national Director of Health Protection, said up to 20 people are at higher risk of the disease following operations.

The average rate of CJD in Ireland is about one in a million people a year. Patients being contacted by the HSE will be told they will need to be monitored over the long term with the possibility that they will undergo medical examinations for the rest of their lives. The HSE said hospital managers are receiving advice from the UK, where medics have dealt with similar cases. "This group is assessing the circumstances of this case to determine what, if any, risk may exist for other patients," she said. "Further information will be available once this group has completed its assessment. "When a case of CJD is diagnosed a review is undertaken to ensure that any precautions, if needed, are taken, in line with the national and international guidance."

CJD is a rare illness and one of a group of diseases called prion diseases, which affect humans and animals, and can be spread to doctors and other patients through medical instruments if they are not put through a rigorous sterilisation procedure or destroyed. Figures show that, over the last 6 years, 30 cases of the disease have
been reported, the highest number -- 7 -- recorded in 2011. A new form of CJD -- called variant CJD (vCJD) -- which is linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, was identified in 1996. Just 4 cases of vCJD in total have been identified in Ireland to date [19 Jul 2013]. It is understood the latest CJD patient was operated on 2 weeks before the diagnosis. "Until the necessary risk assessment is completed and the necessary contact made with patients, it [the hospital] is not in a position to discuss the issues under review.

[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is caused when proteinaceous particles called prions attack the brain, leading to mental deterioration and, ultimately, death. It can be transmitted via contaminated surgical equipment (iatrogenic CJD). Classical CJD can be either sporadic (of unknown origin), inherited (familial), or variant CJD (vCJD) believed to have originated from a prion responsible for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and transmitted to humans through consumption of contaminated meat. The type of CJD identified in the patient(s) undergoing surgery in Beaumont hospital, Dublin is not revealed but is unlikely to be vCJD.

In total, 209 cases of variant CJD cases had been identified in 11 countries (as of 2008). Most (176) were recorded in the Untied Kingdom (UK). During the period when these 176 vCJD cases were identified, there were 1640 cases of other forms of CJD identified in the UK. That is, even at the height of the vCJD epidemic, cases of vCJD were rare. No cases of vCJD have been identified in the UK since 2011. In Ireland during the same period, only 4 cases of vCJD were identified and none since 2006. It is extremely unlikely that the CJD patient receiving surgery in the Dublin hospital is a case of vCJD. It remains to be established whether this patient is a case of sporadic or familial CJD.

Prion particles are highly resistant to even the most stringent sterilisation procedures, and it has been recommended that instruments employed in surgery involving CJD patients should be discarded and never reused. Further information from Beaumont Hospital is awaited. - Mod.CP
