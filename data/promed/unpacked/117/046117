[According to the press release published on 16 Jul 2021 by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture of the Republic of Ghana (https://cdn.modernghana.com/files/717202141800-j5eq27t2gb-press-release.pdf), HPAI has been confirmed in the Greater Accra, Central, and Volta Regions. However, in this current immediate notification, the case in Volta has not yet been officially reported to the OIE.

This press release also mentioned that: "Through effective surveillance and disease control management the Veterinary Services Directorate has prevented the extension of the disease into Ghana until now.

"Cases of the Bird Flu disease were previously recorded in 2007, 2015, 2016, and 2018, with significant economic impact on affected poultry farmers. The zoonotic nature of the disease calls for public alert and vigilance to mitigate the possible impact on the poultry industry and public-health in general.

"Accordingly, the Ministry announces the following measures for immediate compliance:
1. A total ban on the importation of Poultry and Poultry products from neighboring countries where the prevalence of the disease has been confirmed.

2. A ban on the movement of Poultry and Poultry Products within and from the affected regions and districts to other parts of the country, and strict inspection and issuance of permits to cover the movement of all poultry and poultry products from unaffected parts of the country.

3. Intensification of public awareness and sensitization by Regional Coordinating Councils and District Assemblies, especially in the affected areas".

Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtypes H5, H5N1, H5N6, and H5N8 are circulating in the Sub-Saharan Africa. More detailed information and maps are available at http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/HPAI_Africa/situation_update.html (last update 14 Jul 201).

For this HPAI event, the neuraminidase has not yet been typed. Determining the subtype and strain of this virus is very important. - Mod.CRD
