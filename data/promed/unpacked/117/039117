VIRAL NERVOUS NECROSIS, FISH - AUSTRALIA (02)

Several native Australian fish species, as well as barramundi (_Lates
calcarifer_) are known to be susceptible to infection and/or to
develop clinical disease. Experimentally, Macquarie perch
(_Macquaria australasica_), silver perch (_Bidyanus bidyanus_) and
Murray cod (_Maccullochella peeli_) have been shown to develop
clinical signs and lesions typical of viral nervous necrosis (VNN)
following bath exposure to virus. Histological lesions of VNN
together with viral particles have been described in Australian
catfish (_Tandanus tandanus_), and a nodavirus has been isolated from
clinical cases of VNN in sleepy cod (_Oxyeleotris lineolatus_).
VNN is -- and remains -- a major threat to the native fish fauna of
the Murray Darling basin of southeastern Australia. Every effort must
be made to prevent its incursion into this ecosystem. The reported
quarantining of the farm is a commendable and appropriate action that
may have prevented escape of virus and consequent infection of native
fish in the immediate vicinity. However, to state that the virus
does not pose any risk to native fish species appears misleading.
