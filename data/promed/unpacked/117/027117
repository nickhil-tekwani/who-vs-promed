[In September 2015, Saudi Arabia reported 2 outbreaks of foot-and mouth disease serotype A. The event was declared resolved on 15 Nov 2015. The event summary and map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=18889

The following comment by Mod.AS, published in posting 20151229.3899816, is applicable here:
"According to the results obtained from the WRLFMD, the virus was identified as serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype VII, most closely related to strains circulating in the Indian subcontinent. The serotype A vaccine strains included in the genotyping tests did not match this new strain. The said strain is regarded as a new strain in Saudi Arabia, reported as such. The report further indicated that "the event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted." However, the current Saudi report is a follow-up report. It includes interesting information on vaccine strains tested. According to this information, the vaccine strain "A-SAU-95" showed some effectiveness, while A-Iran-05 showed no effectiveness. The concerning bottom line is that no commercially available vaccine confers satisfactory protection against the new strain at present."

According to the data in the "FMD genotyping" section of the WRLFMD (Pirbright) website, 3 samples for genotyping were received there from Saudi Arabia on 24 Oct 2016; their results "pending". These results are anticipated with interest (see at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/me/sau.htm. - Mods.CRD/AS
