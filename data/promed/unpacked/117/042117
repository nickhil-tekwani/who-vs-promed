Japanese Encephalitis Surveillance and Control Enhanced
-------------------------------------------------------
BEIJING: The recent outbreak of epidemic encephalitis B [Japanese
encephalitis] in parts of Guangdong Province has aroused the concerns of
some citizens, worrying whether this infectious disease will affect Beijing
as did the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. Regarding
this, an expert with Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention
pointed out in an interview that epidemic encephalitis B [Japanese
encephalitis] will not occur in Beijing. He Xiong, Deputy-Director with the
Beijing center mentioned above, said his center is keeping a careful watch
over the situation of the outbreak in parts of Guangdong and is
intensifying monitoring of Beijing in the meanwhile.
As a matter of fact, the city had long ago included vaccination against
encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] in its children's immunization plan,
and the vaccination proportion has all along been kept at around 98
percent. Although the vaccination [programme] this year has been adversely
affected by SARS, it will have been completed by July at the latest. When
vaccinated, people will have antibody, so it is scarcely possible to get
infected by this disease. Since the pathogen of encephalitis B [Japanese
encephalitis] exists in pigs and the disease is transmitted by mosquito and
other insects, the center has also strengthened monitoring of pig herds.
Judging from information on hand, Beijing is capable of controlling the
spread of encephalitis B.

Chinese Provinces Act Against Japanese Encephalitis
---------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis, which has killed at
least 19 people, has spread to 2 more Chinese provinces. State media says
at least 18 children have died among 211 infected by the disease in
southern Guangdong, and cases have now been reported in central Hunan
province and China's southernmost province of Hainan. The China News
Service says while numbers are down on last year, residents are being urged
to take measures to prevent infections.

South China Provinces Confront Japanese Encephalitis Outbreak
-------------------------------------------------------------
South China's Guangdong and Hainan provinces are quick in action to respond
to encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] after 19 people have died from
the disease. Guangdong Province yesterday set up a special task force as
the province witnessed the deaths of 18 residents from the disease, most of
whom are children under 14 years old. The move came as Guangdong and the
island province of Hainan came under attack from the disease over the past
week. Hainan reported one death yesterday from its 12 patients.
The Ministry of Health has released an emergency call, urging enhanced
preventative measures including inoculation to curb the deadly disease.
Ministry sources said yesterday that it will send investigative teams
throughout the country to check up on vaccination work in different
regions. Speaking at a conference on diseases prevention, Huang Huahua,
Governor of Guangdong, said yesterday that his province had to organize a
strong team of medical expert to focus on the treatment and prevention of
the disease. The move aims to avoid or minimize the deaths caused by
encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis], which has been detected in many
cities in the province which borders Hong Kong and Macao. Huang urged local
public health departments and hospitals to pay special heed in treating the
infectious illness and try to save all the encephalitis B [Japanese
encephalitis] patients in the province.
Encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] usually comes to its infectious peak
period in Guangdong between May and July. To prevent encephalitis B from
spreading further in the province, the Guangdong Provincial Bureau of
Public Health has inoculated more than 100 000 children across the province
since the outbreak of the disease earlier this month. More than 90 percent
of Guangdong's encephalitis B patients are children under 14 years old.
Many are children of the migrant laborers. An official from the Guangdong
Provincial Bureau of Public Health said that his bureau would focus on
vaccinating the children of migrant workers who have followed their migrant
worker parents to Guangdong and organizing more anti-encephalitis B
publicity in the following months.
The official believed that encephalitis B [Japanese encephalitis] outbreak
had basically been brought under control after great efforts have been made
to fight it. The province had detected a total of 220 encephalitis B
[Japanese encephalitis] patients by yesterday. The port cities of Maoming
and Zhanjiang in the western area of Guangdong Province have even been
hardest hit by the flu-like disease, the official said.

[These reports are perhaps an indication of disruptive side-effects of the
SARS outbreak in the Far East. Locally developed and produced inactivated
and attenuated vaccines have been used extensively in China to protect
children from Japanese encephalitis virus infection. The current outbreak
suggests a breakdown in surveillance and routine vaccination programmes.
Japanese encephalitis is enzootic and and occurs throughout the year in
many tropical parts of Asia. It is maintained in a cycle involving culicine
mosquitoes and aquatic birds, and pigs are a primary amplifying host. The
Chinese media appear attached to an earlier name for the disease; epidemic
encephalitis B, which is derived from the fact that the disease was the
most prevalent encephalitis attributable to a group B arbovirus (the group
B arboviruses are known now as the flavivirusess). - Mod.CP]
