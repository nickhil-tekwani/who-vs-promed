DFG Asks Northern Californians to Remove Bird Feeders to Slow the Spread of
Avian Disease
---------------------------------------------------
On 10 Feb 2005, the California Department of Fish and Game issued the
following notice to the public about finches, called pine siskins, being
affected by salmonella, apparently like the ones in Minnesota.
"The California Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is encouraging northern
California residents to remove bird feeders for at least one month to help
slow an outbreak of salmonellosis, a disease affecting small brown birds
known as pine siskins that live primarily in wooded areas.
Human exposure to and contraction of the disease from wild birds is rare
and unlikely, especially if basic precautions are taken. However, pets can
contract the disease, especially if they are exposed to fecal matter below
the feeders.
Pine siskins are brown, streaked birds with yellow patches on the wings and
tail. Their diet consists primarily of seeds, making bird feeders
particularly attractive. Birds contract the disease from one another, most
often by eating fecal-contaminated food -- but also by sticking their heads
inside tube feeders, where their eyes come in contact with the feeder itself.
California's West Nile virus hotline has received many tips from concerned
citizens reporting dead pine siskins throughout the forested areas of
northern California, from Grass Valley to Eureka. Salmonellosis is a
bacterial disease and is not related to the West Nile virus.
To help control the disease, DFG biologists are urging residents to
discontinue feeding birds for at least 30 days, and when feeding is
resumed, to:
1. Replace all food in birdfeeders and water in birdbaths daily. Clean up
old food around feeders daily, and only use small amounts of food.
2. Decontaminate feeders by using a 10 percent solution of household bleach
in water, preferably cleaned just prior to adding new food.
3. Spread small amounts of seed over a large area in the sun, instead of
using bird boxes or feeders. Also, vary the location of seeds to avoid
encouraging a concentration of birds at one site.
4. Replace wooden bird feeders with plastic or metal. Wood harbors
salmonella bacteria and cannot be sanitized as effectively.
5. Use gloves when handling dead birds and bird feeders and wash hands with
anti-bacterial soap when finished.
This is the 2nd time in less than a year that DFG has asked that bird
feeders be removed to slow the spread of a disease affecting birds. In July
2004, DFG asked that all bird feeders be removed for the purpose of slowing
an outbreak of trichomoniasis in California's mourning dove and band-tailed
pigeon populations. More detailed information about that disease and tips
on controlling it and other avian diseases can be found at
