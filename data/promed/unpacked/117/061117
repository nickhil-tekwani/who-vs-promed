[1] UAE, new case - WHO Global Alert and Response

On [20 Mar 2014], the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the case provided to WHO are as follows:
A 49-year-old man from Abu Dhabi with underlying medical conditions. He was admitted to a hospital on [27 Feb 2014] and was discharged on [9 Mar 2014] following improvement in his condition. On [16 Mar 2014], he was readmitted to the hospital and is currently in a critical condition. Laboratory-confirmation was done on [19 Mar 2014]. The patient has no history of recent travel. He has no reported contact with animals but had contact with a recent laboratory-confirmed case notified to WHO on [11 Mar 2014]. Both the patients received treatment in the same hospital on [1 Mar 2014]. Further epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 199 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 84 deaths.

[2] Saudi Arabia, human case associated camels with MERS-CoV

Human Infection with MERS Coronavirus after Exposure to Infected Camels, Saudi Arabia, 2013. Memish ZA, Cotton M, Meyer B, Watson SJ, Alsahafi AJ, Al Rabeeah AA, et al. Emerg Infect Dis [Internet]. 2014 Jun [date cited]. [Full article available at: http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/6/14-0402_article.htm.]

Abstract:
We investigated a case of human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) after exposure to infected camels. Analysis of the whole human-derived virus and 15 percent of the camel-derived virus sequence yielded identical nucleotide polymorphism signatures suggestive of cross-species transmission. Camels may act as a direct source of human MERS-CoV infection.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was identified in 2012 in a cell culture taken from a patient who died of pneumonia in Saudi Arabia (1, refs. at source URL). Since 2012, at least 187 laboratory-confirmed human cases of MERS-CoV infection, most resulting in respiratory tract illness, have been reported to the World Health Organization; 97 of these cases were fatal. Known cases have been directly or indirectly linked to countries in the Arabian Peninsula (2, refs. at source URL). Dromedary camels across and beyond the region show high rates of antibodies against MERS-CoV (3-7, refs. at source URL), and viral RNA has been detected in camels in different countries (8, 9, refs. at source URL). In one instance, a camel and 2 humans caring for the camel were found to be infected with viruses that were highly similar but distinct within 4395 nt of the camel-derived virus sequence, including several phylogenetically informative nucleotide changes (10, ref. at source URL). To investigate possible camel-human virus transmission, we analyzed an infection with MERS-CoV in a man after he had contact with an infected camel.

[This newly reported case represents the 16th laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection with exposure in the UAE. According to the above WHO update, the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection is now at 199 including 84 deaths. This tally does not include the 3 cases (including one death) reported on the Saudi MOH website and reported in ProMED-mail's post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (17): Kuwait, UAE, Saudi Arabia, WHO, RFI 20140320.2345849, nor does it include the 3 cases reported on the Saudi MOH website and reported in ProMED-mail's post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (18): Saudi Arabia 20140321.2347610. The addition of these 6 cases (including one death) will raise the global tally of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection to 205 including 85 deaths.

While the article in the Journal of Emerging Infectious Diseases presented above in [2] does not definitively prove causality and direction of human-camel interaction resulting in infection with MERS-CoV, it is another piece of supportive evidence that camels may well be an intermediate host responsible for human infection with MERS-CoV.
