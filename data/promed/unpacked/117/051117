Veterinary Services, APHIS, United States Department of Agriculture would like to point out for your readers' information:

The H5N8 incursion into North America in 2014-2015 was a wholly Eurasian virus.

The H5N2 and H5N1 later detected were reassortants of the Eurasian highly pathogenic avian influenza with North American low pathogenicity avian influenza viruses.

For additional information on the clade 2.3.4.4 viruses in North America, we refer you to Torchetti et al, 2015 (Torchetti MK, Killian ML, Dusek RJ, et al. Novel H5 clade 2.3.4.4 reassortant (H5N1) virus from a green-winged teal in Washington, USA. Genome Announc. 2015;3(2). pii: e00195-15. doi: 10.1128/genomeA.00195-15; available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4384482/).

[The ProMED-mail post referenced above a report (translated from Arabic) from the Egyptian media source 'elwadynews', dated 8 Jun 2016. The report included the following texts: "Veterinary sources revealed a state of confusion in the Ministry of Agriculture as poultry flocks were suspected of being infected with the 'USA' avian influenza virus that has devastated the poultry industry in the United States," and "suspicion of H5N8 infection" (see http://elwadynews.com/news/2016/06/08/112327).

The new HA clade, termed 2.3.4.4, emerged around 2010-2011 in China and revealed a novel propensity to reassort with NA subtypes other than N1, unlike many earlier clades. 2 subtypes, H5N6 and H5N8, have spread to countries in Asia (H5N6), Europe, and North America (H5N8). See also ref 1.

HPAI H5N8 virus caused a large-scale outbreak in South Korea, starting 24 Sep 2014, declared resolved 12 Feb 2016. During the event, 179 outbreaks were notified to the OIE and more than 4.3 million domestic birds (chickens and ducks) destroyed. This strain has been already been reported from several countries in Asia and Europe (see ProMED-mail posts listed below).

Information on the HPAI H5N8 outbreaks in the USA since December 2014 and on the agent's genotyping results is available in several ProMED-mail postings, including 3 OIE notifications (20141217.3037995, 20141222.3049031, and 20150126.3120342) respectively addressing a case in a captive wild gyrfalcon in Washington State (start 10 Dec 2014), an outbreak in a small mixed backyard flock of guinea fowl, chickens, ducks, and geese in Oregon (start 16 Dec 2014), and the 1st outbreak in a commercial (turkey) farm, in California (start 19 Jan 2015). All 3 OIE reports included detailed information on the sequencing results obtained, indicating a high similarity of the HA sequence to Eurasian strains such as A/bean goose/Korea/H40/2014 and of the neuraminidase sequence to Eurasian strains such as A/Baikal teal/Korea/H80/2014. The amino acid sequence at the hemagglutinin cleavage site was consistent with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). (Subscribers may wish to see the full data in the said 3 OIE reports; the last one includes a USDA press release).

We hereby present the epidemiological comments included in the latest OIE notification (20150126.3120342):

"The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), in conjunction with State Departments of Agriculture and Wildlife, are continuing to conduct a comprehensive epidemiological investigation and enhanced surveillance (including wild bird surveillance of hunter harvested birds) in response and to the HPAI H5N8 and H5N2 wild bird related events. Novel avian influenza virus of Eurasian origin (EA-H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4) spread rapidly along wild bird migratory pathways during 2014. Introduction of this EA-H5N8 virus into the Pacific Flyway sometime during 2014 has allowed mixing with North American (AM) lineage viruses and generated new combinations with genes from both EA and AM origin (or 'reassortant' viruses), such as the EA/AM H5N2-reassortant detected in Canada and the US. These findings are not unexpected as the EA-H5N8 virus continues to circulate. The EA H5 clade 2.3.4.4 viruses are highly pathogenic for poultry. The detection of the HPAI H5N8 in the commercial turkey flock is considered to be related to the recent avian influenza events in wild birds. The partial HA/NA sequences are over 99 per cent similar to A/gyrfalcon/WA/41088-6/2014 based upon direct sequencing from swabs of 2 different turkeys. The commercial turkey premises is in a remote location and has been quarantined. Comprehensive epidemiological investigation and enhanced surveillance is being conducted. Additional recent testing of other turkey houses on the premises has been negative for avian influenza."

The reason for the application, in the Egyptian media report, of the term "USA strain" remains to be clarified. Hopefully, samples have been submitted from Egypt to the reference laboratory; the detailed genetic profiling of this strain, allegedly circulating in Egypt, is anticipated with interest.
