South Korea: Lapses in Screening of Donated Blood
-------------------------------------------------
South Korea's Red Cross mishandled donor information and circulated blood
donated by hepatitis virus carriers, infecting 9 people, government
auditors said on Mon 29 Mar 2004. The Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI)
called on the Korea National Red Cross to punish officials responsible for
shipping blood donated by hepatitis virus carriers to hospitals and
pharmaceutical companies for 5 years up until Jan 2004.

A BAI audit conducted at the end of 2003 found that 76 677 units of blood
received from donors who had been infected with hepatitis C virus had been
distributed for transfusions or research by the Red Cross, a board official
said. The South Korean branch of the international agency also put into
circulation 228 units of blood donated by 99 people who had been suspected
of carrying human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but who later tested
negative for the virus, the official said. 9 people were found to have been
infected with hepatitis [C virus?] during February 2004 after receiving
blood transfusions from the Red Cross, the officials said.

South Korean Red Cross spokesman Lee Jae-sung said the problems stemmed
from a change in laws in Apr 2000 that banned donations from people who had
been infected with hepatitis. The previous law had allowed donations from
people who were hepatitis-free at the time they gave blood. It was not
immediately clear whether there were also cases of hepatitis infections
through blood donations made before Apr 2000 under the earlier rules. "We
changed the rules for donation, but we only acquired a system to
investigate donors' disease history in May 2003," Lee said by telephone.
"The 9 people infected with hepatitis [C?] virus received blood during the
period between 1 Apr 2000 and May 2003," he said.

One of the 9 already had hepatitis before receiving the tainted
transfusion, he said. "We take full responsibility for the other 8 people
and plan compensation," Lee said, adding the suspect units of blood had
been used up by the time 2003's audit had been done. New procedures for
checking donors' medical history had made it "impossible for people who had
been infected with viruses to donate their blood", he said.
