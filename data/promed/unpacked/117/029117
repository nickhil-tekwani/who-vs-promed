There are 3 very important learning points regarding infant botulism:
1. In the USA we think honey when we think infant botulism. In Argentina they found that the presence of botulism spores in various chamomile products was almost the same and now ask parents not to use chamomile products in children below 1 year of age.

2. Pediatricians must include the diagnosis whenever they work up a child for possible sepsis! Delay in therapy is serious.

3. There is a rapid test available for detecting botulism but it has not become the gold standard, which remains the mouse assay. Delay from waiting for the mouse test can delay therapy and add unnecessary length of time to the hospitalization.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Marcus for his comments. Indeed, spores of _Clostridium botulinum_ have been found on a variety of herbs by South American investigators. The herbs include chamomile (1), linden (2), and others including anise and senna (3), all which may be used to produce teas. It is, however, unclear if any of these herbs have been specifically associated with cases of infant botulism.

Regarding rapid laboratory conformation of botulism cases, real time PCR assays can certainly be used (4). With a clinical diagnosis of botulism, however, acquisition of an antitoxin should not await even the PCR assay.
