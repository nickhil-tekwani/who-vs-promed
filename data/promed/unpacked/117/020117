The urine and blood samples of 2 more victims who experienced fatigue and dizziness after drinking premixed coffee were found positive for syabu. [Syabu is an amphetamine derivative used in the form of a crystalline hydrochloride. - Mod.TG]

Penang police chief Datuk A. Thaiveegan said the results were obtained last week [week of Sun 4 Feb 2018] but the police were still waiting for the chemistry department to produce results of the coffee samples.

He said so far, test results of blood and urine samples of 4 individuals, including the 2 men who drank the durian-flavoured instant coffee, were tested positive for methamphetamines.

"Police are still investigating whether the coffee had been mixed with drugs by certain syndicates but to date, we have not come to any conclusion on involvement of syndicates, because we have yet to make any arrest.

"Police are also tracking down the woman believed to have distributed the coffee at a food court, and we are confident that her arrest will give us some leads," he told reporters after launching the computerised patrolling system (Cops Box) here yesterday [Thu 15 Feb 2018].

On [Sun 4 Feb 2018], 2 men were admitted to Penang Hospital (HPP) after drinking the premixed coffee, which left them dizzy and nauseous. Earlier, 5 individuals, which included 2 women, were treated at the same hospital when they experienced extreme fatigue after allegedly drinking a "durian white coffee" mixture. The 7 people, aged between 19 and 62, were warded for observation and tests on 2 of the 7 individuals were found positive for syabu.

[The durian is the fruit of several tree species belonging to the genus Durio. There are 30 recognised Durio species, at least 9 of which produce edible fruit, and over 300 named varieties in Thailand, 102 in Indonesia, and 100 in Malaysia.

Of course, the smell of durian fruit is very strong and peculiar. The odor has variously been described as old gym socks, or rotting meat or even turpentine. Those descriptions of a durian flavored coffee would not make me wild about it. However, coffee is not a smell or taste in and of itself that everyone likes. Perhaps the smell of the durian fruit is masked somewhat by the smell of the coffee? Perhaps to some it enhances the flavor of the coffee, much like chocolate or caramel to some other flavored coffee drinkers.

Syabu as defined by a medical dictionary is "A regional term for crack cocaine; methamphetamine." https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Syabu. However, an online dictionary produces the definition as, "an amphetamine derivative (trade name Methedrine) used in the form of a crystalline hydrochloride; used as a stimulant to the nervous system and as an appetite suppressant" https://www.thefreedictionary.com/Syabu

Either way I wonder what a crystalline form of methamphetamine is doing in instant coffee. Instant coffee if frequently in powder or crystals, so may be possible the coffee vendor did not recognize it. Was it put into the instant coffee prior to the coffee stand receiving it? Was it intentionally put as a target to one or more people who may frequent the coffee stand?

Hopefully the coffee stand has been shut down and no other individuals will be affected.
