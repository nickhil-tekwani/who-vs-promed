Bluetongue risk 'starts in April'
---------------------------------
Livestock farms in the UK will again be at risk from bluetongue from
the 2nd half of April [2008], predict scientists. Researchers have
produced a map showing when farms in different parts of England and
Wales are at most risk. They say midges that could spread the virus
will become active from the middle of March [2008], but could begin
infecting livestock just weeks later.

Last year [2007], only a small number of farms were affected, but
scientists warn many more are at risk during 2008. The head of the
team feared that a vaccine would not be ready until after the 1st
animals had become infected

Philip Mellor of the Institute for Animal Research warned that the
disease, if left unchecked, would spread across the country this
year. "In the UK in 2007, the disease involved between 60 or 70
farms," he told BBC News. "But with the sort of increase in infection
we've seen in northern Europe, we'd be expecting thousands of farms
to be infected this year."

Professor Mellor's team has been studying the life cycle of midges
and what happens to them when they are infected with the bluetongue
virus. The researchers have discovered that if the temperature
doesn't drop below 15C (59F), it would take about 2 weeks for the
insects to build up a sufficient amount of the virus to infect livestock.

Assuming that this year's weather follows the same pattern as 2007,
they have built up a picture of how they think bluetongue could spread.

Current estimates suggest that animals in Kent will be the 1st to be
at risk from 21 Apr 2008. But days after, midges in other parts of
southern England could begin spreading infection. By May, outbreaks
could be happening in Wales and the Midlands; towards the end of the
month and early June 2008, the disease is predicted to have made its
way to northern England.

According to one of the scientists involved, John Gloucester, who is
on secondment from the Met Office, the projections should help the
government contain the disease.

"At the end of the day, we can't stop the midges from flying from one
area to another," he told BBC News. "But clearly we can target the
vaccines and general surveillance in the areas that are 1st likely to
become infected."

The government's acting chief vet Fred Landeg has ordered 22.5
million doses of vaccine. "Almost certainly the disease will
re-emerge because that's been the experience of northern Europe," he
said. "Unlike last year in northern Europe, we hope that vaccine will
be available and should limit clinical signs in herds and protect
them from infection. "But I think if people don't vaccinate you will
see the disease re-emerge with a vengeance and slowly spread."

Professor Mellor's and his team's projections suggest that the 1st
infections could begin before the 1st batches of vaccine are
available to farmers.

"This vaccine is supposed to arrive in May this year - that's the
time that virus transmission should be getting underway," he
explained. "So it's a race between the delivery of vaccine and
transmission of the virus - it is going to be a very close race."

[On 22 Feb 2008, Defra announced the extension of the Bluetongue
Surveillance Zone into Cornwall. A map, showing the updated
Bluetongue disease Protection and Surveillance zones as well as the
Welsh Restriction zone, is available at
<http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/notifiable/bluetongue/pdf/map-bt-pzsz080222.pdf>.
The announcement says also that the 'vector free' period would end at
23:59 on 15 Mar 2008 and that if livestock keepers wish to move their
animals before the end of the vector free period, they should ensure
they leave enough time to carry out pre-movement testing of their
animals, receive negative results, and move the animals before 23:59
on 15 Mar 2008.

As at 13:00 on 22 Feb 2008, there were in the UK 81 confirmed
premises affected by Bluetongue. The most recent cases were found as
a result of pre-movement testing currently required in the
vector-free period; see also
