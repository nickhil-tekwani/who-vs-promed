Former North Carolina Democratic Senator Kay Hagan has died at the age of 66. Hagan died [Mon 28 Oct 2019] after battling encephalitis caused by rare tickborne Powassan virus, a statement from her family said. Hagan was diagnosed with encephalitis in late 2016, and suffered from failing health for the remainder of her life.

"We are heartbroken to share that Kay left us unexpectedly this morning," Hagan's family said in a statement. Hagan died peacefully in her sleep at her home in Greensboro, North Carolina. Hagan suffered from poor health in the last years of her life, having trouble speaking and using a wheelchair. Hagan's family said she contracted the Powassan virus, a rare condition transmitted by ticks that can lead to encephalitis or swelling of the brain. In 2018, she was unable to attend a tribute to her in Raleigh because she was hospitalized for pneumonia, the News & Observer reported.

[It is not clear where Senator Hagan contracted her Powassan virus infection. She had been in Washington DC before her illness but doubtless traveled to some states in the USA where this tickborne virus is endemic.

Tables, graphs, and a map showing the occurrence of Powassan encephalitis cases in the USA from 2009-2018 is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website at https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/statistics.html.

CDC's tables show one case reported in North Carolina in 2016. It is not clear if this case was Senator Hagan or a different one. The unfortunate Hagan case is an example of the health problems that survivors of encephalitis from Powassan virus infection can experience. Approximately half of the people who survive severe disease have long-term health problems such as recurring headaches, loss of muscle mass, and strength and memory problems. These complications doubtless shortened her life significantly. - Mod.TY
