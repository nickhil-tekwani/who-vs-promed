Experimental Bird-to-Bird Transmission of West Nile Virus
----------------------------------------------------------
Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) reported today that West
Nile virus can be transmitted from bird-to-bird in a confined laboratory
setting. [Previously it had been thought that the virus was only transmitted
through mosquito bites. Scientists from the USGS National Wildlife Health
Center in Madison, Wisconsin, placed infected birds in the same biocontainment
(BL3) aviary as healthy birds. The infected birds died 5 to 8 days later.
Most of the [initially uninfected birds, the researchers found, also became
[infected and died 5 to 8 days after the first infected bird died. "It
confirms a suspicion that we had and wanted to verify," said Dr. Robert
McLean, director of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center. "The setting
was a very controlled scientific experiment and we're not sure if or how
this relates to what is happening in the wild. Mosquitoes are the primary
means of transmission of the virus between birds and to humans. But this
certainly opens up a host of new questions."
Chief among the questions, McLean said, is exactly how the virus moves from
bird to bird. He said that he and other scientists are working on that
question now. "We know that crows are highly susceptible to the virus and
that they are more likely than other bird species that live in close contact
with one another to transmit the disease to other crows," he said. "We know
that the virus attacks the crow's entire body and often affects all the
major organs. So far we don't know how sensitive other bird species are to
the West Nile virus." McLean said that even though the research is
significant, it means more to the wildlife community than the public health
community as the threat of humans contracting the virus directly from birds
is slim.
In the experiment, 16 crows were housed in a 16-foot by 20-foot flight room
with 12-foot ceilings. There, they shared food and water and sat on common
perches. The room was cleaned daily. Nine infected birds died within 5 to 8
days. Four healthy or "control" birds died from the virus 5 to 8 days later.
[The fifth control bird died 11 days after that, meaning that the virus was
transmitted [directly from initially healthy birds to another healthy bird.
The experiment was done in collaboration with the Wildlife Conservation
Society who also helped fund the study.
An earlier test where infected and healthy birds were housed in separate
cages placed side-by-side showed no evidence of direct transmission of the
virus leading McLean to believe that the virus is not transmitted through
the air. "Now we're not sure how it moved: by mouth, by preening, did the
birds shed the virus in their feces? We're not sure," he said. " But by
keeping the infected and healthy birds together in close contact, we really
maximized the potential that this bird-to-bird transmission could take
place. Now we know it did and we want to figure out how."

[While these experiments do not imply that the human population is at risk
of West Nile virus infection from free-living birds, they may have great
significance in the context of the spread of West Nile virus in the natural
environment. For example, they may provide clues as to why this virus might
be so slow in disseminating and why chickens and mosquitoes might not be
infected when crows are infected in the same areas. - Mods.CHC/CP
