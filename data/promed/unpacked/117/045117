[1] China - Hong Kong concerns

Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department said
that of 3430 wild birds found dead and tested for H5N1 this year
[2007], 15 had tested positive, all for the "Fujian" strain of the
virus. It is the same strain identified in a scientific paper
published in October 2006 by University of Hong Kong virologists Guan
Yi and Malik Peiris, and US flu expert Robert Webster, of St Jude's
Children's Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.
The researchers called it a new strain of the deadly H5N1, and said
it had emerged in October 2005. The strain had been found in almost
all poultry outbreaks and in some human cases in southern China, and
had been detected in Hong Kong, Laos, and Thailand. In 2006, 15 wild
birds and 2 hens tested positive to the strain in the area.
The scientific community now suspects that China has not been
transparent about its mapping of the virus. The Chinese Agriculture
Minister defined the research data as "false" and the viral strain
"non-existent". Yet in December 2006, WHO (World Health Organization)
acting assistant director-general, David Heymann, said the strain had
been circulating since 2005 and that the mainland had provided
information and sequencing data about the strain.
Hong Kong sources confirm that diseased migratory birds died in large
numbers in periods when China did not report any infections in the
area. They fear that the virus is far more widespread than official
Chinese data claims, given the lack of information forthcoming from
Beijing regarding new cases of infection among poultry and humans.
Hong Kong has halted imports of live poultry and poultry meat from 13
provinces, where infection has been confirmed.

[The paper mentioned, "Emergence and predominance of an H5N1
influenza variant in China" addressing the "Fujian" strain, authored
by G.J.D. Smith and 13 others, was published online ahead of print on
30 Oct 2006, and later printed in Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 2006 Nov
7;103(45):16936-41. Its abstract was included in ProMED-mail's
archived posting 20061031.3116, with commentary to which readers are
referred; further discussion followed in posting 20061102.3144. -

[The URL above includes a map -- in Chinese -- titled "China avian
influenza: disease distribution map (number of human cases confirmed
by the Chinese Ministry of Health)".
Since the map, updated on 30 Mar 2007, is not available online in
English, we requested Dan Silver to translate the Chinese text.
His translated/edited reply, for which we are most grateful, follows. - Mod.AS]
The map's legend would best be translated as follows:
Red circle: location of human avian influenza occurrence
Brown-yellowish areas: area [where] avian influenza outbreak [was]
extinguished.
Below is the list of locales shown on the China CDC map. The map does
not show dates of cases. I looked these up online individually (date
of onset).
The list starts from the upper right of the map and proceeds clockwise.
1. 1 case, Heishan County, Liaoning Province, 30 Oct 2005.
2. 1 case (died), Wuhan Municipality, Hubei Prov., 1 Apr 2006.
3. 1 case, Yingshang County, Anhui Prov., 11 Feb 2006.
4*. 1 case (died), Bengbu City, Anhui Prov., 17 Mar 2007.
5. 1 case (died), Anqing City, Anhui Prov., 1 Nov 2005.

[The list of cases above falls in line with the information included
in ProMED-mail's thread on human avian influenza incidence in China;
the most recent case dated 30 Mar 2007 (20070331.1103) is not yet
included.
In broad general terms, correlation can be observed between the
incidence of human and animal cases, on a geographical/provincial
level. Some of the cases (marked with an asterisk in the list above),
demonstrate deficient correlation:
4*. Human case -- March 2007; last reported animal outbreak -- November 2005.
6*. No report on animal disease.
7*. Human case -- February 2006; last reported animal outbreak -- January 2004.
8*. Human case -- December 2006; last reported animal outbreak --
November 2005.
10*. Human case -- February 2007. No official report on animal
outbreaks (there was anecdotal media information in March 2007).
11*. Human case -- December 2005; animal outbreaks -- see 10*.
13*. Human case -- January 2006; animal outbreaks -- see 10*.
15*. Human case -- June 2006; last reported animal outbreak -- February 2004.
16*. Human case -- February 2006; animal outbreaks -- see 15*.
17*. Human case -- Nov 2005; last reported animal outbreak -- February 2004.
Since the start of the epizootic, 89 outbreaks in domestic birds have
been officially reported to the OIE by the Chinese authorities. They
were located in the following 22 out of China's 31 principal
administrative units (excluding Hong Kong and Macao Special
Administrative Regions):
Anhui, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Inner
Mongolia, Jiangxi, Jilin, Liaoning, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi,
Shanghai, Sichuan, Tianjin, Tibet, Xinjiang, Yunnan, and Zhejiang.
(see administrative map of China at
<http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2003-02/19/content_815536.htm>)
In addition, the H5N1 HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) virus
was identified in sick and dead wild birds in multiple locations,
including massive outbreaks in 2005 (Qinghai lake) and in 2006
(Qinghai and Tibet), affecting various species, particularly
bar-headed geese. A recent updated list of wild-bird cases,
identified in dead birds collected in April-May 2006 in Tibet,
Qinghai, and Liaoning, has been included in China's follow-up report
No. 5 to the OIE (World Animal Health Organization), submitted on 6
Mar 2007. The report is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/reports/en_fup_0000004997_20070306_172454.pdf>.
The Chinese animal-disease reporting system has been demonstrating
improvements in its quality and transparency throughout the reviewed
period; this positive trend, reflected also by the publication of the
updated epidemiological map, deserves recognition and encouragement.
