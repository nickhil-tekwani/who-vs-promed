Over 20 camels have died in Yanbu recently after eating contaminated
fodder, said livestock owners. They complained that the Ministry of
Agriculture has failed to deploy vets to deal with the problem.

"Five of my camels died after eating fodder I purchased last Sunday
from the Yanbu fodder market. The fodder was sold at a comparatively
low price," said Nayer Al-Refaie, a livestock owner.

He added that 20 of his camels were fed with the contaminated fodder
and that after their health worsened, he began feeding them other
stuff. "However, it didn't make a difference. The camels' health
worsened," he said. "So I went to the Ministry of Agriculture and
tried to get a vet to check on my herd. However, I was told that
there was no veterinary doctor," he added.

Al-Refaie said he went to the Governor's Office and met an official
who telephoned the Ministry of Agriculture to arrange a vet. "The man
told him that the doctor was in a village far away from Yanbu and was
checking on a bird flu report. I don't know what to do; my camels are
dying, and I don't know why," he said.

A Ministry of Agriculture source told Arab News that there simply are
not enough vets in the Yanbu region. "We're in need of at least 10
doctors because the province is quite vast. Also, livestock owners
need to be careful. They are buying cheap fodder and poisoning their
own animals," he said, adding that the Ministry of Commerce is
responsible for checking on the quality of fodder sold at markets,
not the Ministry of Agriculture.

[Yanbu' al Bahr (Arabic: "spring by the sea"), also known simply as
Yanbu, Yambo, or Yenbo, is a major Red Sea port in the Al Madinah
province of western Saudi Arabia, approximately 350 km north of Jeddah; map at:

It will be interesting to note whether the current cases are related
to the mass mortality involving at least 2000 (according to some
sources 5000) Saudi camels observed in another region -- Wadi al
Dawaser -- since August this year 2007. The mortality was suspected
to be caused by fodder intoxication, probably by the ionophore
Salinomycin. An official report from the responsible authorities has
not been forthcoming so far. - Mod.AS]
