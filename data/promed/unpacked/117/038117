It was confirmed on Tuesday [14 Oct 2014] that an inmate at the Chillicothe Correctional Institution in Chillicothe, Ohio has been diagnosed with the bacterial infection, leprosy, or Hansen's disease. According to the Associated Press, the unnamed inmate, who has been in the prison system since January 2011, is from Micronesia, and officials believe he contracted the infection there. He is currently being treated at the Ohio State University hospital.

The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections says the prisoner has been housed in 3 other prisons during his time. Although no inmates or prison staff have showed symptoms of leprosy, Stuart Hudson, chief of medical services for the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction, said all inmates who came within a 3 foot [1 metre] radius of the man will be screened for signs of the infectious disease, Medical Daily reports.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by _Mycobacterium leprae_, an acid-fast, rod-shaped bacillus. The disease mainly affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and also the eyes.

Official figures show that almost 182 000 people, mainly in Asia and Africa, were affected at the beginning of 2012, with about 219 000 new cases reported during 2011.

_M. leprae_ multiplies very slowly and the incubation period of the disease is about 5 years. Symptoms can take as long as 20 years to appear. Leprosy is not highly infectious. It is transmitted via droplets, from the nose and mouth, during close and frequent contacts with untreated cases. Untreated, leprosy can cause progressive and permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs, and eyes.

Early diagnosis and treatment with multidrug therapy (MDT) remain the key elements in eliminating the disease as a public health concern. Leprosy is curable and treatment provided in the early stages averts disability.

[About 150 new cases of leprosy are reported each year in the USA. About 70 per cent of those cases have acquired their disease when they lived or worked in leprosy-endemic regions outside the USA; however, about 30 per cent report no foreign residence and therefore likely acquired leprosy in the USA. Most of these indigenously acquired cases reside in Texas and Louisiana, and case-control studies have shown that contact with _M. leprae_-infected armadillos by hunting, handling, or consuming armadillo meat is a risk factor for acquisition of leprosy in the US.

The news report above says that the prisoner presumably acquired leprosy in Micronesia. Micronesia is comprised of 5 sovereign states, the Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, and Palau, and 3 US territories. Micronesia is in WHO Western Pacific Region. Leprosy was eliminated as a public health problem, defined as a prevalence rate below one case per 10 000 population, was achieved in 34 of the 37 countries and areas in the Western Pacific region. The Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands never reached leprosy elimination, while Kiribati failed to maintain the elimination threshold.

Although leprosy is not highly contagious, because patients with the lepromatous form of leprosy excrete enormous numbers of leprosy bacilli in their nasal secretions (that is, are multibacillary), a patient with untreated lepromatous leprosy poses increased risk for transmission of the infection to close, long-term contacts, such as household members. People with tuberculoid leprosy have few organisms (that is, are paucibacillary) and are less contagious. We are not told what form of leprosy this prisoner has. In any case, most of the prisoner's contact will have had natural immunity and casual and short-term contact does not seem pose a risk for spread the disease. Patients are no longer infectious after a multidrug regimen is started. - Mod.ML
