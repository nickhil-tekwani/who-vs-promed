The [Namibia] Ministry of Agriculture, Water and Forestry has issued an anthrax alert to members of the public and farming communities in the Caprivi Region. This comes after tests confirmed that an elephant died from the bacterial disease in the Masikili-Nakabolelelwa area recently.

In a press statement, the ministry's permanent secretary, Joseph Iita, warned members of the public at large not to touch, open, or eat meat from any animal carcass that dies on its own or of unknown causes.

According to the statement, by the time veterinary officials arrived at the scene of the dead elephant, the local villagers in the area had already opened the carcass and helped themselves to the meat. Urging people in the vicinity of Masikili and Nakabolelelwa who had contact with the elephant in question to visit the nearest clinic for appropriate advice, Iita warned: "Handling such meat or eating meat from such animals puts the people at serious risks of contracting anthrax."

Iita said anthrax is a vaccine-preventable disease in livestock, and urged livestock owners to vaccinate their animals against the disease once a year. "Anthrax carcasses should be disposed of by deep burial or burning without opening them. This limits contamination of the environment by the causal bacteria," Iita added.

[In the 2008 event we last reported there were 4 elephants down in Caprivi as well as in nearby Botswana, so I suspect we may hear of further cases.

Anthrax cases in elephants are routinely reported in the Etosha and Chobe national parks, as well as in Caprivi. Considering the constant threat of livestock anthrax in that region, it would be logical to have enforced annual vaccination of the cattle. As of yet, there is no vaccine specifically for wild elephants, and the economics of attempting it with the Sterne strain of the vaccine would rule that out; darting them from helicopters and land rovers would be far too expensive to be even considered, especially as the veterinary service appears to be unenthusiastic. If my memory serves me right, anthrax is seen in the Etosha elephants typically at the end of the wet season and then is followed by antelope anthrax in the dry season.

The tension between farmers and roaming elephants is of long standing but more complex than this piece would indicate. Part of the rumpus reflects a desire by some rural folk to harvest elephants for their ivory. Elsewhere in Africa, elephants have decreased significantly in numbers thanks to uncontrolled poaching and loss of habitat by the invasion of parks by marginal farmers.

Dealing with elephant carcasses is difficult, as one would imagine. The prescribed technique is to pile the carcass with thorn brush to discourage scavengers while the carcass decomposes. The drop in pH will kill the vegetative cells quickly in the unopened carcass. Burning takes a significant volume of wood, and it is hard to ventilate the underside of the elephant carcass properly.
