The 1st reported local chikungunya case in Singapore was detected
through a laboratory-based General Practitioner (GP's) surveillance
network, in the middle of January 2008. In the surveillance system,
GPs are encouraged to consider chikungunya as a possibility, when they
suspect dengue. In addition, samples sent for dengue PCR testing, and
found to be negative for dengue, were screened for chikungunya. Prior
to the detection of this 1st local case, about 10 imported cases were
detected through an extensive surveillance system that includes the
hospitals and GPs.

Since the detection of the 1st case, enhanced surveillance throughout
the country [along with] active case detection around the cluster,
have picked up another 12 cases, from about 3000 samples screened.
They are all linked to a localised area of about 0.3 sq.km. No new
case has been detected since the end of January [2008].

In the area around the transmission, we caught only _Aedes aegypti_
adults. It is thus believed that _Aedes aegypti_ is the principal
vector in this cluster. Phylogenetic analysis of the local viral
sequences has revealed that they cluster very tightly with the strains
isolated from India during its 2006 outbreak. This puts the local
strains under the Indian Ocean genotype.

[ProMED is very appreciative of this 1st-hand report on the small
chikungunya virus outbreak in Singapore, provided by Dr. Ng Lee-Ching.
The Singapore surveillance system, supported by thorough and timely
laboratory workup of samples, and aggressive field epidemiological
studies and vector control efforts, is an outstanding example of
detecting and then responding to the appearance of a disease new to
an area. It appears that this chikungunya virus outbreak has ended.
