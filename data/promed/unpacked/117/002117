Cases of dengue fever have risen to 412 in the northern Philippine province
of Pangasinan including 10 deaths, local authorities said Tuesday.
Provincial Health Officer Alyle Ochotorena earlier said she may declare the
province under dengue outbreak if the cases reached 450.
All the 10 fatalities were children aged from 3 to 15, Philippine News
Agency quoted her as saying.
Noting the latest report on dengue cases, Governor Victor Agbayani reminded
the public anew to take all the necessary precautions to avoid the disease
until the rainy season is over. "Dengue fever is a deadly disease but it
is preventable," Agbayani said as he called on community officials to
undertake massive clean-up campaign in their respective localities and
schools. Ochotorena said the provincial health office had been conducting
a massive information campaign on the nature, cure [sic and prevention of
dengue fever.
