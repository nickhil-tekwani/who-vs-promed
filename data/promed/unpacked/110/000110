Listeria contamination advisory - USA 981107100508

Smoked shad from Royal Baltic, Ltd. is, according to this story, being
recalled because it could contain Listeria monocytogenes The smoked shad
was distributed in vacuum packaging or as unpackaged and unlabeled whole
fish in retail stores in New York, California, Illinois, Oregon, and
Washington states. The product recall includes codes 2710, 2810, and 2910.
No illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
The potential for contamination was noted after routine testing by the New
York State Department of Agriculture & Markets revealed the presence of
_Listeria_ in the smoked shad.
Consumers should return the product to the place of purchase for a full
refund. They can also contact Royal Baltic of Brooklyn, N.Y., directly at
718-385-8300.
[This is apparently going to the "Year of _Listeria_", just as the last few
years where "Years of E. coli O157:H7". There have already been several
major recalls in the US in the last 2 months in meats (Winn-Dixie/Dixie
Packers franks & luncheon meats, IBP cooked burgers), and it is a frequent
occurrence in prepared salads and soft cheeses. USDA and FDA are apparently
accelerating compliance testing at retail.
This particular pathogen is a psychrotroph, growing down to 0-2 C. So
post-cook environmental contamination is the principal problem, with
grow-up to infectious doses in the refrigerator.
_Listeria monocytogenes_ is a serious risk to pregnant women (spontaneous
abortion) and to immunocompromised [persons in general. Normally healthy
people usually recover from an infection quickly with little lasting effect
other than partial immunity.
Incidence of listeriosis has been steady at 0.5 cases per 100,000
population in 1996 and 1997 (MMWR September 25, 1998 Vol. 47 No. 37.)
After _Listeria_, we can expect _Yersinia enterocolita_ to start appearing
in the news: it is also a psychrotroph, and contributes more known
outbreaks than _Listeria_. - RAL
