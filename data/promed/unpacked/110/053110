With most of the media focused on the ongoing measles outbreaks around the world, another vaccine-preventable, infectious disease has reached 5 [US] states during 2019.

As of 6 Feb 2019, the states of Georgia, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Utah, and Wisconsin have reported mumps cases during 2019.

These state-based news reports have yet to be confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), who has not yet issued a mumps outbreak report for 2019.

During, 2018, the CDC did confirm 2251 mumps cases in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Additionally, several colleges reported on-campus mumps outbreaks.

The 2018 data were actually good news when compared to 2017 when over 6000 mumps cases were confirmed by the CDC.

The current states reporting mumps cases during 2019 are as follows:

Georgia: Nancy Nydam, Director of Communications for The Georgia Department of Public Health, wrote, "An outbreak of mumps has been reported at the facility and the investigation is ongoing."

Pennsylvania: Officials at Garrett-Ford Elementary in Drexel Hill, Delaware County, are warning parents after a student was diagnosed with mumps.

North Dakota: The North Dakota Department of Health says 2 cases of mumps have been reported in Williams County. And, North Dakota Department of Health says there have 3 more cases of mumps recorded in Stark county.

Utah: Parents of children attending Sunset Elementary School were sent a letter from the Southwest Utah Public Health Department, warning them after a student stayed home sick with the disease [15 Jan 2019], after exposing teachers and students for up to 3 days.

Wisconsin: A Marquette University student has contracted mumps. In an email to students, the school said the infected student lives in one of the residence halls.

A major factor contributing to mumps outbreaks is being in a crowded environment, such as attending the same class, playing on the same sports team, or living in a dormitory with a person who is infectious with mumps, says the CDC.

Also, certain behaviors that result in exchanging saliva, such as kissing or sharing utensils, cups, lip balm, or cigarettes, might increase the spread of the virus.

The MMR [measles, mumps, rubella] vaccine prevents most, but not all, cases of mumps and complications caused by the disease.

The mumps component of the MMR vaccine has reported being 88 percent effective when a person gets 2 vaccine doses.

According to another study, one potential cause of these mumps outbreaks is 'waning-immunization.'

A previous study from the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health found that vaccine-derived immune protection against mumps persists an average for about 27 years, after the last administered dose.

In response to the expanding number of mumps outbreaks, the CDC released guidance in October 2017, regarding when a 3rd dose of mumps vaccine is appropriate.

This new CDC guidance did not recommend a 3rd MMR dose outside of a 'confirmed mumps outbreak'.

Another reason for mumps outbreaks could be under-vaccinations by international travelers.

[It is not surprising that mumps cases are increasing in number. If fewer children are being vaccinated with the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, all of these diseases will increase in the population. Furthermore, mumps immunity apparently wanes after approximately 27 years, making this age group vulnerable again. - Mod.LK

A group of migrants along the southern border were found to be sick with the mumps. The cases were discovered near the Laredo border.

According to local health officials, it was years ago since they last saw cases like this at a detention center.

In December [2018], 9 confirmed cases were detected at an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility there.

Thousands of migrants cross through Laredo's ports of entry; Border Patrol reports 3449 were encountered there since October [2018].

Dr Hector Gonzalez, Laredo Health Department Director says, "There's an international community of the entire border. So, people from all over cross, legally and illegally, every day."

The City of Laredo Health Department was called in to the GEO detention center in Laredo.

Health screenings often reveal trends, explains Dr Gonzalez. "We usually see 1-2 cases per year of tuberculosis, but we haven't seen mumps in years."

According to Dr Gonzalez, 9 migrants, mostly Central American and Mexican, have mumps.

In a statement provided by ICE, it stated they "quarantine everyone who may have been inadvertently exposed to stop the spread of the disease."

It also stated migrants normally get medical screening, a virus they were exposed to prior to the detention center stay could be harder to detect until symptoms became visible.

Dr Gonzalez said some people at the facility were vaccinated against the disease after the discovery was made.

Both local governments along the Laredo/Nuevo Laredo border are monitoring the situation.

Jose Martin Carmona Flores, Director of the Tamaulipas [Mexico] Institute for Migrants, said they offer migrants at their shelters several services. "Before anything else, we check their health. "

Dr Gonzalez explains having international citizens in his city means health officials must foster a global awareness.

"One of the things is we see people coming from other parts of the world, especially the Congo, from Africa, and we want to make sure there's no exposure to yellow fever, malaria. The Congo is having an outbreak of Ebola, but they're vaccinating everyone so, yes, we monitor very closely."

Mumps has the capacity to spread very quickly through the detained community who are living in close contact with each other. The virus is spread through saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat.

According to the CDC, the virus can be transmitted before the salivary glands begin to swell and up to 5 days after the swelling begins. The early stages before swelling are risky since it is not evident the infected individual is infectious. It is for that reason that quarantine of exposed individuals is adopted . - Mod.LK]
