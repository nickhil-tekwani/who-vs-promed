- The next round of sub-national immunization days are planned for late January [2018].
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission. As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- Phase 3 of outbreak response is going ahead in January [2018], taking into account many of the recommendations made at the recent Outbreak Response Assessment and Technical Advisory Group meetings. The objective is to maintain and improve the multi-national, regional outbreak response across the Lake Chad region.
- Vaccinators additionally used the polio infrastructure to provide Vitamin A and deworming tablets.

Central Africa
- No new cases of type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) were reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The total number of cVDPV2 cases this year is 10.
- The most recent case in the country occurred in Tanganika province, with onset on [14 Sep 2017].

- Outbreak response continues to take place across the country, including use of monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) in line with internationally-agreed outbreak response protocols.
- In December [2017], immunization rounds aim to reach over 8 million children with polio vaccine.
- Surveillance and immunization activities continue to be strengthened in neighbouring countries.

[2] Lake Chad region, uncertain surveillance efficacy - media report
Date: Thu 20 Dec 2017, 1:37 PM
Source: VOA News [edited]

Scientists warn a campaign to eradicate polio in central Africa is falling short because of upheaval in the Lake Chad Basin area, where the Boko Haram militant group remains active. On the positive side, one country - Gabon - has been declared polio-free.

Professor Rose Leke, who heads the Africa Regional Certification Commission for polio eradication, says Central Africa has seen no cases of polio in the past 15 months. But, she adds, scientists cannot be sure the polio virus has been eradicated in the region.

Leke says medical teams find it difficult getting access to conflict zones in Mali, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and parts of Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria affected by the Boko Haram insurgency.

"DRC has circulating polio viruses, so many of them. We are worried about the country and so we have specific recommendations also for DRC and for all the others. We are still very concerned about the Lake Chad basin area, the Borno [state in Nigeria] area where we do not know what is happening. I think that is a concern for the entire world," she said.

Leke says polio cases have decreased by more than 99 percent in the past 30 years, from an estimated 350 000 per year to just 37 reported cases in 2016. She says as a result of the global effort to eradicate the disease, more than 16 million people have been saved from paralysis.

According to the United Nations, once a case of polio is recorded, it takes 3 years of no other cases to declare the zone polio-free. Gabon recently reached that goal.

Gabon's neighbor Cameroon has attained the status of "non-polio exporting country," but is still considered a high-risk nation like other African states with an influx of refugees from conflict zones that health care workers mostly avoid.

But Alim Hayatou, Cameroon's secretary of state in the ministry of health, says the country is also on track to be polio-free. He says they have prepared an ambitious plan to make sure Cameroon eliminates polio by 2019.

Central African states have organized numerous inoculation campaigns, but more than 15 percent of children in the region remain unvaccinated due to cultural resistance, conflicts and illiteracy.

[Take away messages from the above reports:

- While the total number of reported cases of WPV1 associated polio is at a record low (20 for this year - 2017 - if one includes the early notification of the case in Balochistan Pakistan), the question that remains as vocalized in the media report on the Lake Chad Basin is whether surveillance activities are sufficient in conflict zones (for which unfortunately there are many) to ensure that there isn't still circulation of the WPV1 "under the radarscope".

-There seems to be an increase in activity in both Pakistan and Afghanistan in the past several weeks with weekly confirmations of new cases, and continued evidence of transmission of the WPV1 in both countries both by newly confirmed cases as well as positive environmental samples isolating the WPV1.

- Polio eradication means eradication of all circulating polioviruses, including both the WPVs as well as the VDPVs (vaccine derived polioviruses). The outbreak of cVDPV2 in Syria is a sober reminder of the need to interrupt transmission of the cVDPVs related to the use of OPV in areas with suboptimal vaccination coverage, thereby facilitating the evolution of cVDPVs from the OPV viruses.

- It appears as though the cVDPV transmissions associated with outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have been interrupted with no new cases identified in either location in the past 3 months (but caution must be exerted in this presumption at present, as poliovirus can be excreted for over 6 weeks).
