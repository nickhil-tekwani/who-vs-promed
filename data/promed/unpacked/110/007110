Woman ill after touching bird with virus
----------------------------------------
People are urged to avoid contact with birds after a woman fell ill
after touching a black-headed gull which later tested positive for
avian A/(H5N1)5 influenza virus infection.

Centre for Health Protection Controller Dr Thomas Tsang told reporters
today that the 48-year-old woman had developed flu symptoms yesterday,
a day after she picked up the sick bird with her bare hands. He said
the woman and her 11-year-old son have been sent to Princess Margaret
Hospital for tests and the results are expected tomorrow [16 Dec 2011]
morning. Other family members have no symptoms.

The Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department collected the
sick bird on 13 Dec 2011 from Chiu Lut Sau Memorial Secondary School
in Yuen Long, where the woman works. The bird died the next day. More
tests are underway. Dr Tsang has advised the school to suspend classes
tomorrow for thorough disinfection.

The Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department has inspected 4
chicken farms nearby and found no abnormal deaths. It is reminding
poultry farmers to strengthen precautionary measures.

People should [notify authorities] if they come across suspicious sick
or dead birds. All relevant government departments will continue to
remain vigilant and enforce preventive measures against bird flu.

[The evidence for transmission of avian A/(H5N1) influenza virus
infection from a sick black-headed gull to a woman and her child is no
more than circumstantial at present. The appearance of flu symptoms in
the woman and her child within 24 hours of contact with the diseased
gull suggests that their illness may be coincidental. The outcome of
the tests at the Princess Margaret Hospital are awaited.
