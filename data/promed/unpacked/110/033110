West Africa: WHO Update on Lassa fever in West Africa
-----------------------
Background
----------
Lassa fever was first described in the 1950s, although the virus was not
isolated until 1969. The disease occurs in West Africa, and is transmitted
to humans from wild rodents, through direct or indirect contact with the
excreta of infected animals. Person-to-person and laboratory infections
occur, particularly in the hospital environment, by direct contact with
blood or other body fluids of patients. The onset of disease is gradual,
with fever, vomiting and retrosternal pain. Signs may include conjunctival
injection, periorbital edema and swelling of the neck. Deafness occurs in
25 percent of all patients. In severe cases, patients suffer shock, fluid
in the lung cavity, haemorrhage and cerebral edema. Approximately 15
percent of hospitalized patients die, but the outcome can be improved by
simple supportive care if provided early in the course of the disease.
Specific treatment with the antiviral drug ribavirin may also be effective.
The signs and symptoms of Lassa fever may be difficult to distinguish from
severe malaria, typhoid fever, yellow fever and other viral haemorrhagic
fevers, but diagnosis can be assisted with simple laboratory support.
Definitive diagnosis requires testing that is available only in highly
specialized laboratories. Health education strategies for preventing
infections in people living in endemic areas focus on rodent control and
minimizing contact with rodent excreta. Measures to control virus
transmission from cases include routine use of standard precautions,
isolation of suspected cases and surveillance of contacts.
Lassa fever is endemic in several West African countries. The most severely
affected countries are in the Mano River Union (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra
Leone) and Nigeria. Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana are potentially at risk. The
incidence of Lassa fever has been increasing in the affected areas. Civil
unrest in the Mano River Union region created newly vulnerable populations,
including refugees and humanitarian relief workers. There have been several
recent fatal cases of Lassa fever among United Nations peacekeeping forces.
The return of areas to government control and the rebuilding of civil
society in Liberia and Sierra Leone puts aid workers at risk of contracting
Lassa fever.
Nosocomial outbreak � Kenema, Sierra Leone, 2004
------------------------------------------------
The Kenema Government Hospital, Sierra Leone, reported an outbreak of Lassa
fever in the winter of 2004, affecting patients from the paediatric ward,
and claiming the lives of several health-care workers. The majority of
cases occurred in young children, many of whom were referred directly from
the paediatric ward, a pattern not previously observed. WHO sent a field
investigation team to Kenema to assist Ministry of Health and Sanitation
officials in assessing the situation and containing further spread. Between
1 Jan and 24 Apr 2004, 95 paediatric cases were admitted, 78 percent of
whom were patients referred from the paediatric ward to the Lassa ward,
compared with only 17 percent in 2003. The mean age of cases was 18 years,
with half of all cases aged under 15 years; 50 percent were female. The
case-fatality rate was 30-50 percent in children aged under 5 years and 71
percent in children aged under 1 year.
The large number of cases discharged from the paediatric ward in a
satisfactory condition and then readmitted for Lassa fever infection within
days to several weeks pointed to nosocomial transmission in the paediatric
ward. The most likely cause was parenteral drug administration from
contaminated multidose vials. Sharing of contaminated needles and syringes
could also not be ruled out. Following implementation of infection control
measures, the outbreak abated.
Mano River Union Lassa fever network
------------------------------------
Recent peace initiatives have opened new opportunities to combat Lassa
fever. The Office of United States Foreign Disaster Assistance, United
Nations peacekeeping forces, the European Union, national and
nongovernmental organizations, as well as WHO have joined forces to
establish the Mano River Union Lassa fever network. This programme will
assist Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone to develop national prevention
strategies and enhance laboratory diagnostics, clinical management and
environmental control of Lassa fever. In addition, a new ward dedicated to
the care of patients with Lassa fever, sponsored by the European Union, is
under construction at Kenema Government Hospital.
On rare occasions, travellers arriving from areas where Lassa fever is
endemic export the disease to other countries. Although malaria, typhoid
fever, yellow fever and many other tropical infections are much more
common, the diagnosis of Lassa fever should be considered in febrile
patients returning from West Africa, especially if they have had exposures
in rural areas or hospitals in countries where Lassa fever is known to be
endemic. Health workers attending a patient suspected of having Lassa fever
should immediately contact local and national experts for advice and to
arrange for laboratory testing.
