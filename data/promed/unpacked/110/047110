Utah: Hanksville Man in Intensive Care as a Result of Hantavirus Infection
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
HANKSVILLE: A 25-year-old man from southern Utah is recovering in a
Provo hospital from a hantavirus infection [presumed to be a case of
hantavirus pulmonary syndrome - Mod.CP that he likely caught 2 weeks
ago. "The nurse listed him in serious condition but said that he has
improved greatly since he was first admitted on Fri 26 Apr 2002,"
said a spokeswoman for the Utah Valley Regional Hospital. The
hantavirus patient, a Hanksville resident, is being cared for in the
hospital's intensive care unit.
The Director of the Central Utah Public Health Department stated that
theman went camping the weekend before he was hospitalized, and by
Tue 23 Apr2002 was suffering from a cough and shortness of breath.
Three days later, after a Hanksville doctor had treated his fever and
diarrhea, the man was flown by helicopter to the Provo hospital. Once
there, the patient was listed in critical condition and has since
been upgraded to serious condition. The hospital spokeswoman said
that the prognosis is good and there are no immediate plans to
transport the man to a higher-level trauma center. It was not
immediately clear if the man was exposed to hantavirus while camping
somewhere near the Dirty Devil River and the Wayne/Garfield County
line, the Director said, or if he was infected while working outdoors
in his hometown or near his family's mobile home.
Dusted on humans through rodent feces and urine that becomes
airborne, often in confined spaces such as sheds or garages,
hantavirus has been inhaled and diagnosed in about 280 Americans, 38
percent of whom have died. Of Utah's 18 confirmed hantavirus cases, 5
have been fatal, according to the Director of the Utah Public Health
Department. Patients also can catch the virus by touching their nose
or mouth after handling materials contaminated with the virus or
through an infected rodent's bite. Symptoms include fever, chills,
headache, muscle aches and occasionally nausea, vomiting and
abdominal pain.
The Director said in response to this case of hantavirus infection,
health workers are [contacting the man's family and friends to see
if anyone else has experienced symptoms. His department and the Wayne
Community Health Center have scheduled a free hantavirus public
information meeting on Mon 6 May 2002 at the Hanksville Elementary
School starting at 6 p.m. Disease experts will be on hand to answer
questions and offer cleaning tips.

[It is presumed from the partial clinical description and the need
for intensive care that this patient represents a case of hantavirus
pulmonary syndrome, although that is not entirely clear. The likely
etiological agent is Sin Nombre virus, which has been previously
recorded in this state. However, this is not confirmed in the report
and the basis for the hantavirus diagnosis is not stated. - Mod.CP
