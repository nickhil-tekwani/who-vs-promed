[The reports of cases yesterday (25 Apr 2014, see [2] below) and today (26 Apr 2014) bring the total number of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia up to 323 including 94 deaths. Transmission continues to occur in primarily Jeddah, Riyadh and to a lesser extent, Mekkah. The preliminary sequencing of the genomes of viruses from cases in Jeddah do not demonstrate sufficient changes to explain this increase in MERS-CoV activity as due to changes in transmissibility of the virus (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (42): Saudi Arabia, genome sequencing, Jeddah 20140426.2432140).

From the above report, nosocomial transmission continues to occur. Cases 3, 4, 5 and 7 from Jeddah are patients who were admitted to the hospital in Jeddah for other illnesses and then developed respiratory disease as a result of MERS-CoV infection.

[3] Egypt ex Saudi Arabia (Riyadh) - media report
Date: 26 Apr 2014

http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA3P0C620140426?irpc=932


Egypt has discovered its 1st case of the potentially deadly Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in an Egyptian citizen who had recently returned from Saudi Arabia, Egypt's Ministry of Health said on Saturday [26 Apr 2014].

The virus, which can cause coughing, fever and pneumonia, has spread from the Gulf to Europe and has already caused over 90 deaths.

The patient, 27, is being treated for pneumonia at a Cairo hospital and is in a stable condition, the ministry said in a statement.

The man, who is from the Nile Delta, was living in the Saudi capital Riyadh, the ministry said.

Saudi Arabia, which has been hardest-hit by the MERS virus, announced on Friday [25 Apr 2014] it had discovered 14 more cases in the kingdom, bringing the total number to 313.

Although the number of MERS infections worldwide is fairly small, the more than 40 percent death rate among confirmed cases and the spread of the virus beyond the Middle East is keeping scientists and public health officials on alert.

A spokesman for the World Health Organisation in Geneva said on Friday [25 Apr 2014] that it was "concerned" about the rising MERS numbers in Saudi Arabia, urging for a speedy scientific breakthrough about the virus and its route of infection.

Saudi authorities have invited 5 leading international vaccine makers to collaborate with them in developing a MERS vaccine, but virology experts argue that this makes little sense in public health terms.

[See the report below for MOH confirmation. - Mod.LM]

[Over the past few months, there have been the occasional "false alarm" reports of suspected MERS-CoV infection in individuals returning to Egypt following a trip/pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia in the local press in Egypt. The wording of the above media report seems more definitive and suggests that the MOH of Egypt has laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection in this individual. If confirmed, this will be the 4th case of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infection in individuals returning to their home countries from either Saudi Arabia or the UAE (to Malaysia, Philippines, Greece, Egypt) in the past 2 weeks.

http://www.mohp.gov.eg/News_webpart/dispNews3.aspx?ID=355


The Ministry of Health and Population has confirmed the 1st case of MERS-CoV infection. The case is a young man, 27-years-old, working as a Civil Engineer in Saudi Arabia for the past 4 years and lives in the city of Riyadh.

The diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was suspected by the quarantine team at the Cairo International Airport, and the individual was taken directly to the hospital by ambulance and was admitted to the hospital. Full infection control preventive measures were taken at that time, in the early hours of the morning of 25 Apr 2014. He was admitted to an isolation facility upon arrival in the hospital. At that time, nose and throat swabs were taken along with a sputum sample and sent to the central laboratory for testing. The result that the specimen(s) were positive for the MERS-CoV were returned on 26 Apr 2014.

By history, the patient developed symptoms while in Saudi Arabia on 22 Apr 2014, when he had a very high temperature, cough, muscle and joint aches, general malaise, and diarrhea. The patient sought medical attention at a hospital in Ryadh, Saudi Arabia, where he was evaluated; blood tests (including kidney and liver functions) and a chest X-ray were done. The latter (chest X-ray) showed the presence of pneumonia. The patient was discharged from the hospital and asked [?] to return back to Egypt, where he arrived at the Cairo airport at 12:30 am on 25 Apr 2014.

Clinical situation of the patient: The patient was evaluated by an infectious disease and pulmonary specialist who reported that the patient is suffering from pneumonia, and his general condition is stable.

Risk factors: this individual was a contact of a known laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infected individual in one of the area hospitals in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia during the past 14 days.

[As we were "going to press" with this update, the original version had a media report on the suspected case. This moderator became aware of the official Egyptian MOH press release and decided to leave in the earlier media report to share our decision-making/evaluation process on what reports to post to our subscribers.

That being said, this case is the 1st case of MERS-CoV infection officially reported by Egypt, although it is related to the ongoing transmission of the MERS-CoV in either Jeddah or Riyadh, Saudi Arabia by the history reported above. While the case was apparently admitted to a hospital in Saudi Arabia, in a review of case reports of MERS-CoV infection reported by Saudi Arabia, this moderator could not find a 27-year-old male of Egyptian nationality in reports over the preceding week (when nationalities were routinely mentioned in the reports). - Mod.MPP]

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update - 26 Apr 2014
------------------------------------------
On [26 Apr 2014], the Ministry of Health of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported 7 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

The following details were provided to WHO on 24 Apr 2014:
- A 45-year-old woman from Abu Dhabi who is a daughter of a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on [22 Apr 2014]. She became ill on [15 Apr 2014]. She is reported to have an underlying medical condition and has no history of recent travel or contact with animals.
- A 4-year-old boy from Abu Dhabi. He developed mild illness on [19 Apr 2014]. He is reported to have no underlying medical condition and does not have a history of recent travel or contact with animals. His mother returned from a visit to Saudi Arabia 10 days prior to his illness.
- A 37-year-old man from Abu Dhabi who was screened following exposure to a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on [10 Apr 2014]. He is reported to have underlying medical conditions. He has no history of recent travel, but frequently visits the 2 farms he owns.
- A 32-year-old man from Abu Dhabi who was screened following exposure to a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on [10 Apr 2014]. He did not become ill and does not have any underlying medical condition. He has no history of recent travel and did not have contact with animals.
- A 33-year-old man from Abu Dhabi who was screened following exposure to a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on [10 Apr 2014]. He did not become ill and is reported to have no underlying medical condition. He has no history of recent travel. He owns 2 farms and is reported to have contact with camels.
- A 30-year-old man from Abu Dhabi. He was screened following exposure to a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on [10 Apr 2014]. He does not have any underlying medical condition. He has no history of recent travel and did not have contact with animals.
- A 42-year-old man from Abu Dhabi. He was screened following exposure to a previously laboratory-confirmed case reported on [10 Apr 2014]. He had mild illness. He is reported to have no underlying medical condition. He has no history of recent travel and had no contact with animals.

To date, all the above-mentioned cases are in isolation in a hospital and are well. Screening of other contacts within the health care setting and families are ongoing.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 261 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 93 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients -- regardless of their diagnosis -- in all work practices all the time.

Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to all patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection. Airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures.

Patients should be managed as potentially infected when the clinical and epidemiological clues strongly suggest MERS-CoV, even if an initial test on a nasopharyngeal swab is negative. Repeat testing should be done when the initial testing is negative, preferably on specimens from the lower respiratory tract.

Health-care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations. All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

People at high risk of severe disease due to MERS-CoV should avoid close contact with animals when visiting farms or barn areas where the virus is known to be potentially circulating. For the general public, when visiting a farm or a barn, general hygiene measures, such as regular hand washing before and after touching animals, avoiding contact with sick animals, and following food hygiene practices, should be adhered to.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[These newly laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in UAE bring the total to 32 cases confirmed since the fatal case in a Filipino paramedic working in the UAE was reported on 11 Apr 2014. While the global total of laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported to WHO is now 261 including 93 deaths, there have been a significant number of cases reported by the Saudi MOH, not as yet reported by WHO. The global total including these additional cases is almost at 400, including well over 100 deaths.

On [18 Apr 2014], a case of Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection was laboratory confirmed in Athens, Greece in a patient returning from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Main symptoms upon initial presentation were protracted fever and diarrhoea; during hospitalisation, he developed bilateral pneumonia, and his condition worsened. During 14 days prior to onset of illness, he had extensive contact with the healthcare environment in Jeddah. Contact tracing revealed 73 contacts, no secondary cases had occurred by [22 Apr 2014].

On [17 Apr 2014], the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP) in Athens, Greece was notified about a suspected case of Middle East Respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in a tertiary care hospital in Athens. The patient had presented a few hours after returning to Greece from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Herein, we report preliminary findings of an extensive public health investigation conducted from [18 Apr 2014] (Good Friday) when the case was laboratory confirmed, through [22 Apr 2014], when contact tracing was nearly complete.

Case report
A 69-year-old Greek national, who resides permanently in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, presented to a tertiary care center with prolonged fever and diarrhoea a few hours after arriving in Athens, Greece on [17 Apr 2014]. He had travelled to Greece on the same day on 2 consecutive flights, one from Jeddah to Amman, Jordan and the other from Amman to Athens. Due to fear of contracting another disease during his travel, the patient was wearing a face mask for most of his journey to Athens up until reaching the hospital.

Clinical presentation and laboratory findings in Athens
He presented at the hospital in Athens with a fever of 38.3 C [100 F] and low oxygen saturation (92 percent). A chest x-ray depicted bilateral lung infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonia. The patient was immediately placed under isolation because of suspicion of MERS-CoV infection and treated by his physicians as community acquired pneumonia.

Laboratory tests were performed on the same day at the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza at the Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Athens. On [18 Apr 2014], the MERS-CoV infection was confirmed based on real-time RT- PCR using primers for the upstream of envelope gene (upE) as a screening test and for the open reading frame (ORF) 1A gene as a confirmatory assay [1]. The same day, the diagnosis was confirmed at the Department of Microbiology of the University of Athens Medical School. Sequencing of the viral genome is ongoing. Laboratory testing for influenza virus, legionella and pneumococcus was negative as well as a stool culture for salmonella. Tests for MERS-CoV using real-time RT-PCR in an oropharyngeal and a rectal swab as well as in a blood and a urine sample were negative.

After notification of the positive result for MERS-CoV, the patient was transferred to a specialised respiratory disease unit in the Chest Diseases Hospital of Athens where he was treated in a negative pressure room. His respiratory function gradually worsened, and, since [20 Apr 2014], he is intubated and ventilated in critical condition in intensive care.

Patient history in Saudi Arabia
The case investigation was conducted through interviews with the patient (before his intubation) and his wife and was based on a standard form available by WHO [2]. Patient history revealed that on [8 Apr 2014], while still in Jeddah, he had developed a fever and visited a local hospital, the Al-Jedaani Group of Hospitals. He returned to the hospital 2 days later, on [10 Apr 2014], when he additionally developed diarrhoea and again on [14 Apr 2014] because of persisting symptoms. He was prescribed ciprofloxacin for a presumptive diagnosis of typhoid fever based on a single positive serology by Widal test (H-antigen test titer of 1:160). Tests for dengue fever and brucellosis were negative, no tests for MERS-CoV were performed. A chest x-ray was negative for infiltrates.

The patient had additional extensive contact with the nosocomial environment in Jeddah from [31 Mar 2014] until [5 Apr 2014] when his wife was hospitalised in the same hospital as above with the laboratory confirmed diagnosis of typhoid fever (positive stool culture mentioned in the history of the patient without further documentation). The patient had continuous contact with his wife during her hospital stay. No MERS-CoV diagnostic was performed in the wife during her stay in the hospital in Jeddah. Laboratory tests on blood, urine, and faeces for MERS-CoV in Greece, several days after her symptoms of infection had resolved, were negative.

The patient had further contact with the healthcare system between [25 and 29 Mar 2014], when he accompanied his wife to her daily physiotherapy sessions at a rehabilitation center prior to her illness. A timeline of events is depicted in the figure.

Figure. Timeline of possible exposure and clinical course of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus infection case, Greece, March-April 2014 [available at Source URL]

The patient had no contact with camels, a known virus reservoir [3, 4] but reported indirect contact with bats, another possible reservoir of MERS-CoV [5], on [15 Mar 2014], outside of the incubation period for MERS-CoV, at an outdoor dinner. Moreover, both the patient and his wife had contact with several people suffering from upper respiratory tract illness with cough as their main symptom during festivities for the Greek National day on [25 Mar 2014], 4 days prior to illness onset for the wife and 14 days prior to illness onset for the patient and during one outdoor dinner on [27 Mar 2014].

Case definition
In Greece a possible case of MERS-CoV infection is defined as follows:
Any patient with an acute respiratory infection, that may include history of fever (greater than or equal to 38 C [100 F]) and cough and indications of pulmonary parenchymal disease (i.e. clinical, radiological or histopathological evidence of pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)), AND at least one of the following:
- history of travel to or residence in affected areas (in the Middle East), during the 14 days before symptom onset;
- close contact, during the 14 days before symptom onset, with a symptomatic confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection;
- being a healthcare worker that cared for a possible or confirmed case of severe respiratory infection attributed to the new coronavirus;
- belonging to a cluster of severe lower respiratory tract respiratory infections;
- respiratory illness not responding to therapeutic measures instituted by the treating physician.

A probable case of MERS-CoV infection in Greece is defined as follows:
A person with a febrile acute respiratory illness with clinical, radiological or histopathological evidence of pulmonary parenchymal disease (e.g. pneumonia or ARDS), AND
- for whom MERS-CoV infection has not been laboratory confirmed, AND
who has a direct epidemiological link to a confirmed MERS-CoV case.

A confirmed case of MERS-CoV is defined as a person with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection.

According to the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention (HCDCP) guidelines, clinical samples from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal swabs), as well as lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, when possible) have to be collected and tested for MERS-CoV in an initial screening by one of the National Reference Laboratories (Hellenic Pasteur Institute, Microbiology Department University of Athens Medical School, Microbiology Department Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Medical School).

Contact tracing
As soon as the diagnosis was confirmed, contact tracing was initiated by the national public health authorities. Despite the reported lack of respiratory symptoms in the patient, Greek authorities decided to aggressively trace all contacts since: (i) the exact mode of transmission of the MERS-CoV virus is not known; (ii) the patient had fever and diarrhoea and; (iii) he was not continuously using his face mask, and there was the possibility that he had mild respiratory symptoms that he ignored.

Contacts were defined according to the scheme proposed in a previous publication [6] as all people who either had close contact with the confirmed case during (i) the air travel, (ii) his "community stay" between the landing of the airplane and his visit to the hospital, (community contacts were defined as i.e. contact with the patient at the household setting, any person who had prolonged (greater than 15 minutes) face-to-face contact with the confirmed case any time during the illness in a household setting or in any other enclosed setting), or (iii) his hospital stay (i.e. a healthcare worker (HCW) who provided direct, clinical or personal care to or who examined the symptomatic confirmed case, or who was within close vicinity of an aerosol-generating procedure). HCW contacts were further sub-classified according to whether they wore full personal protective equipment at the time of contact i.e. correctly fitted high filtration mask, gown, gloves and eye protection or not.

Surveillance of contacts
Active follow-up of all cases was initiated by the command center of the HCDCP for all outpatient contacts and from the hospital infection control committee for all HCW. Contacts were contacted by phone and were asked to report to HCDCP any fever greater than or equal to 38 C [100 F] (via regular temperature checking, preferably twice a day) and/or respiratory tract symptoms and/or digestive tract symptoms during a 14-day period, equal to the maximum incubation period for MERS-CoV according to WHO guidance [7] after their last contact with the confirmed case. Contacts were also provided with a hotline number (the number of the HCDCP command center which operates on a 24/7 basis) and instructed to call anytime in case of any symptoms or other questions.

For all contacts, voluntary baseline and follow-up (15 days) serological sampling was offered for future testing for MERS-CoV antibodies. Oropharyngeal swabbing was offered free of charge to all contacts, especially those experiencing symptoms as well as immediate prolonged face-to-face contact with the case.

Results from contract tracing
73 contacts were identified and placed under clinical surveillance; 12 from the 2 flights, i.e. passengers who were on the same flight as the MERS-CoV case with an assigned seat in the same row and in the 2 rows in front and behind him, 9 community contacts and 52 HCWs at the 2 hospitals (6 not using personal protective equipment). Prolonged face-to-face contact with the index case, defined as a duration of at least 15 minutes within one meter from the confirmed case, was identified in 2 HCWs.

Five contacts chose to undergo oropharyngeal swab testing, 2 relatives, 1 HCW and 2 people exhibiting mild respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms within 3 days after contact. All tested negative for MERS-CoV and were offered repeated testing after 7 days or earlier if symptoms worsened.

Further public health measures
Revised guidance to HCWs for early recognition and response including the institution of the necessary screening, prevention and infection control measures for all suspected cases presenting to Greek Hospitals was sent by email to all hospital administrations to be further distributed to the Infection Control Committee of each hospital and from there to all HCWs on [19 Apr 2014]. A triage procedure for MERS-CoV using clinical and epidemiological criteria is recommended in all Greek hospitals according to the existing national guidance [8].

The HCDCP travel office has issued extensive guidance for points of entry and especially airports, regarding information to all outgoing and incoming travelers from affected areas, as well as guidance for healthcare services at the airport and air flight crew members. Special posters and leaflets have been distributed throughout the main airports of the country, especially in Athens.

The HCDCP is in continuous communication with the Greek Foreign Ministry, Ministry of Defense, the Civil Aviation service, and consulate offices in Saudi Arabia. Appropriate communication regarding the case was initiated at the European level, though the European Early Warning and Response System (EWRS) on [18 Apr 2014]. In addition, the International Health Regulation (IHR) focal points in Saudi Arabia and Jordan were notified about the case and possible exposure of people in their countries.

A press release was issued on [18 Apr 2014] by the HCDCP to inform the general public about MERS-CoV and preventive measures.

Discussion
As of [20 Apr 2014], 250 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been confirmed worldwide since the 1st detection of this novel virus in Saudi Arabia, including 93 deaths [9]. Herein, we report the 4th imported and 10th laboratory confirmed case in an otherwise healthy adult, in the European Union. Other cases have been reported in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy [10-13].

The source of infection of our patient, although unclear, is most likely respiratory transmission from a patient, in the healthcare environment, in Saudi Arabia, as previously reported for other cases [14-17]. Backward investigation revealed close contact with the healthcare environment in Jeddah over several weeks. Regarding other possible sources of infection, we doubt that his brief exposure to bats during dinner with friends in a neighborhood of Jeddah, outside the incubation period for MERS-CoV, could have constituted a significant risk for infection. However, a zoonotic hypothesis should be always considered in similar cases: because the patient did not report any direct contact with bats or camels, this does not mean he did not have any exposure to an animal source of virus that he might have forgotten or not been aware of.

The information about several cases of respiratory illness in the community, deserves attention and should be further investigated. Both the patient and his wife described extensive spread of a "respiratory illness" in the community during the incubation period. Alternatively, he could have contracted the infection from his wife if her febrile diarrhoeal episode was associated with MERS-CoV. Although she tested negative for MERS-CoV, she did not have an x-ray; furthermore, she could have stopped shedding virus by the time she arrived to Greece, and only serological testing will prove whether she had a past infection. The National Reference Center will perform serological tests as soon as an assay becomes available locally. Family clusters of MERS-CoV infections have been described even with asymptomatic or mild cases [18]. If the patient's wife would have been the source of infection, then she would also be a case without respiratory signs and with a very short shedding period; however, this is highly improbable unless she also is a secondary case. If not acquired from his wife, the infection could have been acquired during one of the patient's visits on [10 or 14 Apr 2014] at the local hospital in Jeddah. At this moment, we do not have any official confirmation of whether there had been cases of MERS-CoV in the hospital.

We are not fully convinced by the diagnosis of typhoid fever in this patient because of the negative laboratory findings, despite continued diarrhoea, upon presentation in Greece and the low specificity of a single Widal test [19]. Even though the diarrhoea could have been due to some persistent bowel irritation from a previous typhoid episode, we rather believe that his diarrhoea might be related to the MERS-CoV infection.

Our case together with another recent case of MERS-CoV infection in a traveler from Jeddah to Malaysia [20] as well as the increasing number of newly reported cases by the Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia in the previous days [21] highlight the need for enhanced awareness regarding the presence of the virus in (i) all persons with fever, especially when hospitalised in Saudi Arabia, possibly even when only gastrointestinal symptoms are present, and in (ii) travelers coming from the Arabian Peninsula with symptoms compatible with MERS-CoV infection even when atypical, especially if fever is present. In support of the latter, we would like to point out that our patient had a negative chest x-ray during his hospital evaluation in Saudi Arabia. Moreover, we emphasise the need for vigilance and institution of appropriate, strict infection control measures at the hospital environment in Saudi Arabia.

The absence of respiratory symptoms early in the course of his disease is puzzling in our case. The possibility of mild respiratory symptoms that went unnoticed does exist. Thus, we used a rather sensitive case definition for close contacts that included diarrhoea in order to identify new infections presenting in a similar manner to the index patient and to prevent further spread.

Since large numbers of Greeks reside in the Arabian peninsula, and there is ongoing travel to the affected areas, Greek authorities are considering to issue specific guidance to avoid travel for travelers at risk for developing severe disease similar to the one issued by the Saudi Arabia Ministry of Health for the pilgrimages of Umrah and Hajj [22]. European level action to this effect is anxiously awaited.

In conclusion, every new MERS-CoV case, independent of whether it occurs in the Arabian peninsula, Europe or elsewhere, and the response to it, is associated with a high work load and investment of resources for the public health sector. However, it is, at the same time, a step forward and an opportunity to realise the gaps in knowledge associated with this relatively new worldwide threat.

[In reading the Eurosurveillance report detailing the epidemiologic investigation surrounding the case reported by Greece in a returning expatriate from residence in Saudi Arabia, one sees the difficulties and challenges in trying to trace back and identify the probable exposures that led to the MERS-CoV infection of this individual. This individual had multiple different possible high risk exposures in the health care environment as well as out in the community at large, so definitive identification of this individual's source of infection is likely not to occur.

On reviewing the case reports of the daily Saudi MOH updates, and those of the WHO updates, this moderator can't help but wonder whether some of the nosocomial cases of MERS-CoV infection might well be related to healthcare workers tending to patients in the early stages of their own clinical disease during which time they may be shedding virus. One hopes that there are case-control studies that are being conducted to further identify the high risk exposures that are occurring in the healthcare environment leading to these nosocomial outbreaks. - Mod.MPP
