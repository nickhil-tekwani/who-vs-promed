A small comment about your comment...: ELISA, at least with the antigens so
far available, is not an interesting method to detect _Trichinella_ in
horses because we have proven that six months after infection, horses
experimentally infected became seronegative while still harbouring
infective larvae. (Soule C, et al., Biological and parasitic variations in
horses infested and reinfested by _Trichinella spiralis_, Vet Res.
1993;24:21-31; Soule C, et al., Experimental trichinellosis in horses:
biological and parasitological evaluation, Vet Parasitol. 1989;31:19-36).
However, any idea which could improve the veterinary control would be
greatly appreciated.

[The penny drops! Most pigs go to slaughter when only 6-9 months old so
their infections would have to be new, and thus test revealable. Ably
demonstrates the risks of extrapolating from one species to another. To
