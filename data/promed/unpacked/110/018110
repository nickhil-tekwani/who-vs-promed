Subject: BSE & meningitis and Hemophilus vaccine bans - Italy
I enclose a paper by Prof. Bartolozzi, due to be published in a widely
circulated Journal for pediatricians (Medico e Bambino). The paper comments
on the hasty decision for our health authorities to ban some vaccine lots,
on account of the remote and theoretical risk of BSE transmission. The point
is that the national vaccination efforts, and for Hib in particular, have
suffered from the ban, and from the ensuing media fuss.

[Professor Ottolenghi kindly prepared the following abstract of the
Bartolozzi paper. MHJ]

From: ottolenghi.1@osu.edu (Abramo Ottolenghi)
In an article to be published in the Italian pediatric journal "Medico e
Bambino" Professor Bartolozzi comments on the ban recently enacted by the
Italian Ministy of Health on two Hib conjugated vaccines prepared with
organisms cultured on Brain Heart Infusion (BHI), a culture medium prepared
with neural tissue from animals.
The ban apparently follows a recommendation by the EC that companies
producing vaccines abandon such media. The vaccines in question are
Biocine-Kiron's Vaxem-Hib which had been previously recalled voluntarily by
the firm, and Hib-titer produced by Cyanamid-Praxis Lederle. The ban does
not affect ACT-Hib produced by Merieux-Pasteur which is produced without
using BHI. The ban also affects Mempovax Kiron's meningococcal vaccine. The
article points out that the publicity surrounding the ban has created a
reluctance to vaccinate agaianst other diseases.
The basis for the ban is a fear that BSE might be transmitted via BHI. After
a detailed discussion of BSE and prions, the article points out that since
1991 care was taken that the materials used for the production of vaccines
came from animals from the U.S. and Australia and thus considered to be free
of the BSE-causing agent. It further points out that in January 1997 the
European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products had concluded that
the procedures used in the production of the vaccines were such that there
was no risk of transmitting BSE.
The article reports that Italy is the only country where the vaccines have
been banned, and points to the fact that USFDA has not banned them. The ban
was reported in English by K. McKenzie in BMJ 314:397 1997.
