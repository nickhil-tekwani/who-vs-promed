Italy says checking "probable" cases of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------------
The Italian health ministry said on Saturday it was making checks for
"probable cases" of bird flu in the country.
A one-line statement did not say if the checks were for suspected
cases of infected birds or humans.
The Italian news agency ANSA said the cases involved birds that were
infected in the southern island of Sicily.
The statement said Health Minister Francesco Storace would brief the
cabinet about the developments later on Saturday.

Greece
-------
A wild goose on the central Aegean island of Skyros has tested
positive for an H5 strain of bird flu, the Greek agriculture minister
said today.
The samples will be sent to the European Union reference laboratory
in Weybridge, Surrey, to determine whether the bird had the lethal
H5N1 strain, Evangelos Bassiakos said.
Authorities on Friday [10 Feb 2006] intensified precautions in areas
around Greece's 2nd-largest city, Thessaloniki, where 3 migratory
swans tested positive for an H5 strain of bird flu on Thursday [9 Feb
2006], officials said.

[More details, from both countries, are anticipated soon.
According to Italian media, 17 dead wild swans have been tested in
Italy, by the FAO/OIE Reference lab at Padua. 2 of them have been
found positive H5N1, both from Ragusa, Sicily. The Ministry of Health
has imposed animal movement restrictions for 21 days around the
location (in Italy, Veterinary Services are located in the Ministry
of Health). The other 15 swans, in Puglia (Taranto) and Calabria
(south Italy) are H5, not yet further defined. A map of Ragusa is at
<http://www.italianmade.com/foods/subcat-info23020.cfm>, and a good
interactive map of Italy by Region can be found at

Italy has an historical position re highly pathogenic avian influenza
: in 1878, the disease was identified there for the first time and
obtained -- for many consecutive years -- the name "fowl plague".
However, until 1996 "fowl plague" (a name replaced, during the last
decade of the previous century by "highly pathogenic avian
influenza") was not regarded as a zoonosis. - Mod. AS].
