Rabbit hemorrhagic disease, United States of America
----------------------------------------------------
Information received on 12 Dec 2018 from Dr Jack Shere, Deputy Administrator Chief Veterinary Office r, USDA-APHIS Veterinary Services, USA United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, United States of America

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 17 Nov 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 7 Dec 2018
Reason for notification: recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 5 Oct 2018
Causal agent: Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus
Serotype: RHDV
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Jefferson county, Jefferson, Pennsylvania
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Nov 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Rabbits / 41 / - / 40 / 1 / 0
Affected population: non-commercial pet rabbits.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Rabbits / ** / 97.56 / ** / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comment: RHDV-1 was identified in pet rabbits that died suddenly. Some of the rabbits had slight bloody discharge around the nares. The rabbits were housed in pens in a barn. No rabbits were introduced into the colony in over one year. There have been no known wild rabbit deaths in the area. Note: in Pennsylvania the predominant wild rabbits are eastern cottontails which are not known to be susceptible to RHDV-1. The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and the USDA, Animal Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation of this event.

Control measures
Measures applied: quarantine; stamping out; disinfection; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Rabbits / antigen (Ag) detection ELISA / 7 Dec 2018 / Positive
Rabbits reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 7 Dec 2018 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is a serious and extremely contagious viral disease of domesticated and wild rabbits. Morbidity and mortality rates are high in unvaccinated animals; on some farms, most or all of the rabbits may die. This disease has also caused dramatic declines in some wild rabbit populations, particularly when it is first introduced. This has had a detrimental effect on some ecosystems in Europe, where wild rabbits are an important food source for certain endangered predators, such as Iberian lynx (_Lynx pardinus_). Conversely, rabbit hemorrhagic disease has been used to help control excessive numbers of wild, non-native European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) in Australia.

"The origins of rabbit hemorrhagic disease are not completely understood. The causative virus, rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), may have emerged from avirulent caliciviruses that circulate asymptomatically in European rabbits.

"Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is caused by rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus _Lagovirus_ and family Caliciviridae. There are many strains of RHDV, and 3 major viral subtypes: RHDV ("classical RHDV"), the antigenic variant RHDVa, and the recently emerged virus RHDV2 (also called RHDVb). Classical RHDV and RHDVa comprise one serotype, while RHDV2 belongs to a different serotype.

"There is no indication that RHDV infects humans."
