Possible new case of mad cow disease found
------------------------------------------
WASHINGTON (AP): A second case of mad cow disease (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy; BSE) may have turned up in the United States but the
suspect animal has not entered the food chain, Agriculture Department
officials said on Thursday.
The officials released few details and refused to say where the possibly
diseased animal was found. They said it would be 4 to 7 days before more
could be confirmed, a delay that livestock industry representatives said
would cause turmoil in the beef market.
BSE attacks an animal's nervous system. People who eat food contaminated
with BSE can contract a rare disease that is nearly always fatal, variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
The possible case comes 11 months after the United States had its first
case of mad cow disease. Japan and other countries are still maintaining
bans against U.S. beef as the result of the earlier case. Suspicions about
another case of the disease came because of an inconclusive test result,
officials said.
"The inconclusive result does not mean we have found another case of BSE in
this country," said Andrea Morgan, associate deputy administrator of the
USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. She said the
inconclusive results "are a normal component of screening tests, which are
designed to be extremely sensitive so they will detect any sample that
could possibly be positive."
"It is important to note that this animal did not enter the food or feed
chain," Morgan said. "USDA remains confident in the safety of the US beef
supply. Our ban on specified risk materials from the human food chain
provides the protection to public health, should another case of BSE ever
be detected in the United States." Morgan said initial efforts had begun to
trace back the animal from where it was tested to the farm from which it
originated.
Just before the start of the July Fourth weekend, the department had
announced two other possible cases of the brain-wasting illness in the
United States - but then said follow-up testing had proved negative. Both
were subjected to the more definitive testing after initial screenings for
infection were inconclusive.
Thousands of animals have been tested under new screening procedures that
took effect on 1 Jun to address complaints that too few animals in the
United States are tested for the disease. The mad cow screening programs
used by the government were developed by Bio-Rad Laboratories of Hercules,
California, and have been used in Europe for a number of years.
In the only confirmed US case, a Canadian-born Holstein was found to have
been infected, but just that one case caused Japan and more than three
dozen other countries to refuse US beef. That hurt US export sales and the
farm economy.
Bush administration officials are now focused on trying to get those bans
lifted and with establishing a national identification system for tracking
livestock and poultry from birth through the production chain. Such a
system has worried producers who prefer to keep their records confidential
or run a voluntary ID clearinghouse that would provide government officials
with limited access.

confirmed they are merely suspects, no more, no less. There have apparently
been 3 suspects already this yet. None was confirmed. - Mod.MHJ]
