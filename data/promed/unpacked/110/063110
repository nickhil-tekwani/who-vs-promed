Summary
-------
Background
Stocks of yellow fever vaccine are insufficient to cover exceptional demands for outbreak response. Fractional dosing has shown efficacy, but evidence is limited to the 17DD substrain vaccine. We assessed the immunogenicity and safety of 1/5 fractional dose compared with standard dose of 4 WHO-prequalified yellow fever vaccines produced from 3 substrains.

Methods
We did this randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority trial at research centres in Mbarara, Uganda, and Kilifi, Kenya. Eligible participants were aged 18-59 years, had no contraindications for vaccination, were not pregnant or lactating, had no history of yellow fever vaccination or infection, and did not require yellow fever vaccination for travel. Eligible participants were recruited from communities and randomly assigned to one of 8 groups, corresponding to the 4 vaccines at standard or fractional dose. The vaccine was administered subcutaneously by nurses who were not masked to treatment, but participants and other study personnel were masked to vaccine allocation. The primary outcome was proportion of participants with seroconversion 28 days after vaccination. Seroconversion was defined as post-vaccination neutralising antibody titres at least 4 times pre-vaccination measurement measured by 50% plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50). We defined non-inferiority as less than 10% decrease in seroconversion in fractional compared with standard dose groups 28 days after vaccination. The primary outcome was measured in the per-protocol population, and safety analyses included all vaccinated participants. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02991495.

Findings
Between 6 Nov 2017, and 21 Feb 2018, 1029 participants were assessed for inclusion. 69 people were ineligible, and 960 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to vaccine manufacturer and dose (120 to Bio-Manguinhos-Fiocruz standard dose, 120 to Bio-Manguinhos-Fiocruz fractional dose, 120 to Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides standard dose, 120 to Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides fractional dose, 120 to Institut Pasteur Dakar standard dose, 120 to Institut Pasteur Dakar fractional dose, 120 to Sanofi Pasteur standard dose, and 120 to Sanofi Pasteur fractional dose). 49 participants had detectable PRNT50 at baseline and 11 had missing PRNT50 results at baseline or 28 days. 900 were included in the per-protocol analysis. 959 participants were included in the safety analysis. The absolute difference in seroconversion between fractional and standard doses by vaccine was 1.71% (95% CI 2.60 to 5.28) for Bio-Manguinhos-Fiocruz, - 0.90% (-4.24 to 3.13) for Chumakov Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides, 1.82% (-2.75 to 5.39) for Institut Pasteur Dakar, and 0.0% (-3.32 to 3.29) for Sanofi Pasteur. Fractional doses from all 4 vaccines met the non-inferiority criterion. The most common treatment-related adverse events were headache (22.2%), fatigue (13.7%), myalgia (13.3%) and self-reported fever (9.0%). There were no study-vaccine related serious adverse events.

Interpretation
Fractional doses of all WHO-prequalified yellow fever vaccines were non-inferior to the standard dose in inducing seroconversion 28 days after vaccination, with no major safety concerns. These results support the use of fractional dosage in the general adult population for outbreak response in situations of vaccine shortage.

[Recently, there has been a question about the effectiveness of a reduced yellow fever (YF) vaccine dose of 1/5 the usual volume. Because of inadequate supplies of YF vaccine in 2015-2016 at the time of the Angola and DR Congo outbreak, WHO supported the Ministry of Health in DR Congo to vaccinate 10.7 million people in the city of Kinshasa using this dose-sparing strategy as a short-term measure in order to provide immunity against yellow fever for at least 12 months and likely longer. One of the major achievements of the response to this outbreak was the introduction of an innovative dose-sparing strategy using 1/5 of a regular dose of the yellow fever vaccine, a technique approved by WHO's global vaccine expert group to protect as many people as possible from the immediate threat of a major urban outbreak.

The report above indicates that fractional doses of all WHO-prequalified yellow fever vaccines were not inferior to the standard dose in inducing seroconversion 28 days after vaccination, with no major safety concerns. These results support the use of fractional dosage in the general adult population for outbreak response in situations of vaccine shortage. It would be interesting to know if neutralizing YF virus antibody is persisting in those individuals who received the fractional dose in 2016 in DR Congo. - Mod.TY]
