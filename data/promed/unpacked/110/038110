Baxter sent bird flu virus to European labs by error (update 2)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Baxter International Inc. in Austria unintentionally contaminated
samples with the bird flu virus that were used in laboratories in 3
neighboring countries, raising concern about the potential spread of
the deadly disease. The contamination was discovered when ferrets at
a laboratory in the Czech Republic died after being inoculated with
vaccine made from the samples early this month [February 2009]. The
material came from Deerfield, Illinois-based Baxter, which reported
the incident to the Austrian Ministry of Health, Sigrid Rosenberger,
a ministry spokeswoman, said today [24 Feb 2009] in a telephone
interview. "This was infected with a bird flu virus," Rosenberger
said. "There were some people from the company who handled it."

The material was intended for use in laboratories, and none of the
lab workers have fallen ill. The incident is drawing scrutiny over
the safety of research using the H5N1 bird flu strain that's killed
more than three-fifths of the people known to have caught the bug
worldwide. Some scientists say the 1977 Russian flu, the most recent
global outbreak, began when a virus escaped from a laboratory.

The virus material was supposed to contain a seasonal flu virus and
was contaminated after "human error," said Christopher Bona, a
spokesman for Baxter, in a telephone interview. "Baxter moved very
quickly to sanitize and protect employees," Bona said. "Labs have
been sanitized, potentially contaminated materials have been
destroyed, and employees were tested and considered not to be at
risk."

The Austrian health ministry reported the incident to the European
Union and is conducting its own audit, Rosenberger said. In response,
Baxter said it has put in place "preventive and corrective" measures
that the ministry found satisfactory. The vaccine has been destroyed,
according to Rosenberger. The World Health Organization (WHO) "is
aware of the situation and is consulting with the ministers of health
of the countries involved to ensure that all public risks arising
from this event have been identified and managed appropriately," said
Gregory Hartl, a spokesman in Geneva, Switzerland. The European
Medicines Agency has no immediate comment, said Monika Benstetter, an
agency spokeswoman. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), which distributes seasonal flu viruses to companies for
vaccine manufacturing, isn't investigating or providing consultation,
said Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the Atlanta-based agency. The CDC
is staying in touch with the European Centre for Disease Prevention
and Control regarding the incident, Skinner said.

The H5N1 strain of avian flu has been monitored by health officials
around the world for more than a decade for signs it could mutate
into a form that is easily spread among humans. Currently, it passes
mainly among infected poultry. H5N1 has infected at least 408 people
in 15 countries since 2003, killing 63 percent of them, according to
the website of the Geneva-based WHO.

BioTest s.r.o, a Czech biotechnology company, was conducting research
for a company called AVIR Green Hills Biotechnology using materials
supplied by Baxter. The company was "supposed to get non-infected
testing vaccine, which was by mistake of the supplier contaminated
with the H5N1 virus," BioTest said in a statement last week [week of
16 Feb 2009]. AVIR Green Hills monitored its lab workers for signs of
illness and got access to Roche Holding AG's Tamiflu antiviral in
case of infections, said Birgit Kofler-Bettschart, a spokeswoman for
the closely held, Vienna-based company. AVIR Green Hills sanitized
its laboratories, destroyed potentially contaminated samples, and
told health officials, she said in an e-mail today [24 Feb 2009].

Since 1900, 3 influenza pandemics, including the 1918 Spanish flu
that killed more than 50 million people, have occurred. Another 3
pandemic threats -- situations where a global epidemic is close to
occurring -- have occurred. One was the Russian flu of 1977. The H5N1
virus, "even if it were let out of the lab, would be only lethal for
birds in its present state," said Ilaria Capua, a veterinary
virologist, whose laboratory in Padova, Italy, handles some of the
avian-flu screening for the World Organization for Animal Health
(OIE). Capua said she has no knowledge of the situation. "In Europe,
we can react fast" to outbreaks of the disease in animals, she said.

Baxter, the world's largest maker of blood-disease treatments, is one
of the companies working on a vaccine to be used in case of a flu
pandemic. The European Medicines Agency recommended approval of
Baxter's Celvapan, the 1st cell culture-based vaccine for bird flu in
Europe, in December [2008].

[The nature of the avian influenza virus concerned in this incident
is inadequately described. Greater clarity is required concerning the
origin and identity of the avian influenza virus contaminating the
seasonal vaccine used in the animal experiments in the Czech
Republic. A field isolate, a patient sample, or a laboratory modified
strain? Was it an avian influenza virus strain isolated in Austria,
or one obtained from elsewhere? The 2 countries, in addition to the
Czech Republic, receiving the contaminated material are not
identified. Additional information would be desirable. - Mod.CP]
