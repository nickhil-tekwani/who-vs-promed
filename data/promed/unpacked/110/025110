Update: Multistate Outbreak of Monkeypox --- Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Missouri, Ohio, and Wisconsin, 2003
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CDC and state and local health departments continue to investigate cases of
monkeypox among persons who had contact with wild or exotic mammalian pets
or persons with monkeypox (1,2). This report updates epidemiologic,
laboratory, and smallpox vaccine use data for U.S. cases.
As of 25 Jun 2003, a total of 79 cases of monkeypox had been reported to
CDC from Wisconsin (39), Indiana (20), Illinois (16), Missouri (2), Kansas
(one), and Ohio (one); these include 29 cases laboratory-confirmed at CDC
and 51 cases under investigation by state and local health departments. A
total of 19 cases were excluded from those reported in the previous update
because they met the exclusion criteria outlined in the updated case
definition (2), and 11 were added. Of the 79 cases, 37 (47 percent) were
among males; the median age was 28 years (range: 1 to 51 years). Age data
were unavailable for 2 patients. Among 75 patients for whom data were
available, 19 (25 percent) were hospitalized. Two patients have had a
serious clinical illness. The first patient was a child with a previously
reported laboratory-confirmed case of severe monkeypox-associated
encephalitis (1,2); the child subsequently improved and was discharged
after requiring hospitalization for 14 days. A second child, who was
exposed to 3 ill prairie dogs, was hospitalized with profound painful
cervical and tonsillar adenopathy and diffuse pox lesions, including
lesions in the oropharynx. Although the child had difficulty breathing and
swallowing, mechanical ventilation was not required. The adenopathy peaked
5 days after rash onset and 7 days after onset of initial prodromal
symptoms of general malaise, myalgia, and fever. Preliminary testing of
skin rash lesions was positive for orthopoxvirus infection; confirmatory
testing for monkeypox virus is pending at CDC.
Of the 79 reported cases, 29 (37 percent) have been laboratory confirmed at
CDC for monkeypox by detection of virus in skin rash lesions by using
culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemical testing,
and/or electron microscopy. One patient had monkeypox virus detected by PCR
and culture in throat and nasopharyngeal swabs obtained when the patient
was ill with prodromal symptoms and a macular rash. In addition, an IgM
response to orthopoxvirus antigen was detected in an acute serum sample.
For these laboratory-confirmed cases, dates of illness onset ranged from 16
May 2003 to 11 Jun 2003. All confirmed patients reported a rash and at
least one other clinical sign or symptom, including fever, respiratory
symptoms, and/or lymphadenopathy. The median incubation period (i.e., first
exposure date to illness onset date) was 12 days (range: 2 to 26 days). The
majority of confirmed patients reported exposure to wild or exotic mammals,
including prairie dogs; some patients also had contact with other persons
with monkeypox virus infection in a household setting. No cases of
monkeypox that could be attributed exclusively to person-to-person contact
have been confirmed.
Use of Smallpox Vaccine
-----------------------
To prevent further transmission of monkeypox, 26 residents of 5 states have
received smallpox vaccine since 13 Jun 2003; recipients included 24 adults
and 2 children. Vaccine was administered to 2 laboratory workers
pre-exposure and to 24 persons post-exposure (11 health-care workers, 7
household contacts, 3 laboratory workers, 2 public health veterinarians,
and one work contact). One adult who was vaccinated as a child did not have
a major vaccine reaction or "take" 7 days after vaccination and required
revaccination.
CDC has issued updated interim guidance on the use of smallpox vaccine,
cidofovir, and vaccinia immune globulin for prevention and treatment in the
setting of an outbreak of monkeypox (3). Principal changes in the updated
guidance include a revision of the definition of close contact with an ill
animal, recommendations for vaccination of clinical laboratory workers
handling specimens from ill animals and persons infected with monkeypox
virus, and instructions for reporting smallpox vaccine-related serious
adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS).
Health-care providers, veterinarians, and public health officials who
suspect monkeypox in animals or humans should report such cases to their
state and local health departments. State health departments should report
suspect cases to CDC, telephone 770-488-7100. Clinical specimens should be
submitted for testing after consultation with the state and local health
department. Interpretation of laboratory results requires completion of
specimen submission forms, which are available at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/monkeypox/diagspecimens.htm>. Additional
information about monkeypox is available at
