Wildlife officials say a disease spread by biting flies has killed about 130 white-tailed deer in the state.

Delaware Division of Fish and Wildlife officials reported that the outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease started about 6 weeks ago.

Officials say some 74 dead deer were found in Redden State Forest.

Hunters and farmers are asked to report any dead deer to the Division of Fish and Wildlife.

A disease is killing deer by the hundreds in the North Carolina foothills.

Most of the people Eyewitness News talked with reported seeing the deer carcasses near creeks in northern Caldwell County. Wildlife biologists said that's because the deer look for a cool place after their temperature spikes while fighting off the virus.

State wildlife biologist Danny Ray has fielded calls on dying deer much of the last 2 months. The virus killing the animals is called EHDV [epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus]. "They act sick; they stumble around; they hold their head low," Ray said

Experts said the virus is in various parts of North Carolina, but the hardest-hit is an area of northern Caldwell County.

Wildlife biologists shared photos of deer found dead in Mountain Island Lake. 4 cases have also been confirmed in Mecklenburg County.

Wildlife biologists fear the number of cases in Caldwell County may actually be much higher than 500. Those are just the reported cases -- the number of deaths could be in the thousands.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), the fly-carried malady that has killed white-tailed deer throughout southern Lower Michigan, has felled at least 103 deer within the Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge at Saginaw. That many dead deer have been found by visitors, refuge staffers, and graduate students working on projects at the refuge, according to refuge manager Steve Kahl. Their discovery near water, to which the fevers of EHD drive deer near death, led to their classification as 'likely' victims of EHD.

Federal and state officials have said throughout the outbreak, which has hit southern Michigan and many other states, that dead animals found and tallied are likely only a portion of losses -- "a minimum number," said Brent Rudolph, deer specialist with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, on the agency's website, "since not all deer that die are reported."

EHD was lab-confirmed in 2 of the Shiawassee animals, refuge manager Kahl said. "The DNR [Department of Natural Resources] wanted one from each township, so we sent them one from James and one from Spaulding (townships)."

Total refuge losses were reported to the state DNR all at once last week [8-14 Oct 2012], instead of incrementally, because officials first wanted a clear picture of the outbreak.

The refuge's 1st suspected EHD-killed deer was found 18 Sep 2012. Frost in early October seemed to bring an end to the deer deaths. Is it over? "If not, then it's very close," Kahl said. "Numbers (of losses) have been dropping way off since 7 Oct 2012."

Kahl said that aerial surveys, done each year after deer hunting programs end, usually produce estimates of 600 to 800 deer throughout the entire deer management unit (DMU), which includes the refuge, adjacent Shiawassee River State Game Area, and private lands, "which would make it 300 to 400 on the refuge," Kahl said.

Female deer in the area often have twins, which could easily raise the population by 50 percent or more in spring, he said. Kahl said this winter's population estimates will give an indication of the effect of EHD on deer numbers, but that, "Visitors on the wildlife drive and walking on trails are still seeing deer."

The impact on this year's [2012] deer hunters, who applied earlier for permits, remains to be seen, but Kahl said, "I don't think we're at a point where we need to consider shutting down the deer seasons on the refuge this year."

A chart posted on the DNR's website at [http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,4570,7-153-10370_12150-283966--,00.html] shows 10 430 deer were found dead through 16 Oct 2012 in which EHD is believed to be the cause.

Midland County has no deer losses posted on the chart, which shows 39 counties in which the disease is believed to have killed deer. Saginaw County reported 167 deer lost; Clare, Isabella, and Arenac counties have one deer each.

[EHD is the most important disease of white-tailed deer. Outbreaks are common in many USA states. However, the magnitude of the outbreaks depends on climatic factors that influence the fitness of the vector. This year (2012) the outbreaks appear to be more severe than usual in some states.
