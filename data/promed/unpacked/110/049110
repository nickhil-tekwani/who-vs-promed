Schmallenberg virus disease detected in cows in the suburbs of Moscow
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The Chief Veterinary Officer of the Moscow Oblast [Region] is taking measures to prevent the spread of the Schmallenberg virus [SBV] disease in Ramensky district. The office has conducted a study of biomaterial collected from cattle to monitor infection by dangerous diseases.

As a result of laboratory tests, 16 serum samples of cattle owned by JSC "Plemzavod Ramenskoe", located in the town of Ramenskoye, have been found to include antibodies against SBV.

The disease caused by SBV affects cattle, sheep, and goats. It was originally recorded in Germany. To date, it is little understood but widely distributed in the European Union.

Studies conducted by the Dutch National Institute for Health and the Environment do not exclude the possibility of human infection with SBV.

[The town of Ramenskoye, administrative center of the Ramensky District of Moscow Region, is located nearly 50 km [31 mi] southeast of Moscow and can be located via the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/6LHM.

It is not clear if the animals which have been tested and found seropositive for SBV are local or imported animals. This issue, as well as their breed, age, and, if females and pregnant and their month of pregnancy, are points deserving clarification.

SBV and its international impact, including issues raised by CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries (see ProMED-mail 20130410.1636340), will probably be one of the topics discussed during OIE's 81st General Session, from 26 to 31 May 2013, in Paris.- Mod.AS]
