["Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) of the genus _Orthonairovirus_ of the family Nairoviridae causes a zoonotic disease in many countries of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and south-eastern Europe. As the distribution of CCHFV coincides with the distribution of its main vector, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_, the spread of infected ticks into new, unaffected areas facilitates the spread of the virus. The virus circulates in a tick-vertebrate-tick cycle but can also be transmitted horizontally and vertically within the tick population. _Hyalomma_ ticks infest a wide spectrum of different wildlife species (e.g., deer and hares) and free-ranging livestock animals (e.g., goat, cattle, and sheep). Many birds are resistant to infection, but ostriches appear to be more susceptible. Viraemia in livestock is short-lived and of low intensity. These animals play a crucial role in the life cycle of ticks and in the transmission and amplification of the virus and are, therefore, in the focus of veterinary public health. As animals do not develop clinical signs, CCHFV infections have no effect on the economic burden regarding livestock animal production. In contrast to animals, infections of humans can result in the development of a severe disease, Crimean- Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

"Every year, more than 1000 human CCHF cases are reported from Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, and Turkey. In other countries, infection rates and case numbers are largely unknown. Case fatality rates of 5% (in Turkey) to 80% have been reported and may depend on the virus strain, education of the local population, and the effectiveness of public health interventions. At present, the pathogenesis of the disease in humans is not well understood. Most people become infected by tick bites and by crushing infected ticks, but infection is also possible through contact with blood and other body fluids of viraemic animals. As CCHFV also has the potential to be transmitted directly from human-to-human, nosocomial outbreaks might occur.

"There is no approved CCHF vaccine available, and therapy is restricted to treatment of the symptoms. Health education and information on prevention and behavioural measures are most important in order to enhance public risk perception and, therefore, decrease the probability of infections. Thus the identification of endemic areas is crucial for focused and targeted implementation of public health measures. Serological screening of ruminants allows CCHFV- affected areas to be identified, as antibody prevalence in animals is a good indicator of local virus circulation. Treatment with tick repellents can be quite effective in reducing the tick infestation of animals. To protect laboratory staff, handling of CCHFV infectious materials should only be carried out at an appropriate biocontainment level."

The affected population described in the outbreak no. 3, located in Commune Hassi Ahmed Bechne/localite El Ghotoub, Kobenni, Hodh el Gharbi mentioned "a sedentary herd belonging to a sick patient and his contacts." The human cases mentioned here likely are the same human cases reported in ProMED post 20220215.8701355. - Mod.CRD
