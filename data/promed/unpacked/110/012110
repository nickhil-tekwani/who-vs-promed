A rural worker from Cardona, Soriano, is confirmed as the 10th case of
[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in 1999 and the 15th case since March 1997.
None of the cases in 1999 have been fatal. The 43 year old patient, was
treated in time and had a positive outcome. The patient had spent nights
in sheds in the area of Cardona.
According to the director of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Public Health,
Gloria Ruocco, the early diagnosis of the disease has led to a substantial
reduction in the number of deaths. Early detection allows adequate
treatment, so that the patient survives. Ruocco said that basically, the
disease presents as a pneumonitis, with a very diffuse infiltrate in the
lungs [on chest x-ray, for which [the patient is admitted to an Intensive
Care Unit or an institution where they are able to administer adequate
respiratory assistance so that the patient can survive.
The 15 cases of hantavirus diagnosed in the past two and a half years were
verified in departments to the south of the Negro river. In the opinion of
the sanitary authorities, this requires work in the rural areas under
development in the south of the country, to determine a more narrow
relationship between the workers and the [source of the virus.
Ruocco reminded that it is necessary to air out and sprinkle with
hypochlorite, closed spaces where firewood, grains or other elements are
stored, prior to working in these areas, and to avoid the development of
the field mouse, that transmits the disease through its feces.

[Marjorie Pollack was kind enough to provide this translation from the
original. As to whether treatment has been successful or there is some
other answer remains to be shown. Various hospitals have claimed high
success rates but the data are unclear. For example, the etiologic agent
of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Uruguay may be a hantavirus with low
human pathogenicity or the vertebrate host, the rodent carrying the virus,
may not excrete enough virus to provide an infected human with a fatal
dose. - Mod.CHC
