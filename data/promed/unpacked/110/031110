[The last WHO update for the period up to Thu 21 Apr 2005 (see: Marburg
hemorrhagic fever - Angola (32) 20050423.1136) stated that the Angolan
Ministry of Health had reported 266 cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever, 244
of them fatal. In total, 253 cases, 233 of which have been fatal, were
recorded in Uige Province.
The new figures suggest that there has been an increase of one in case
number and 3 in deaths since Thu 21 Apr 2005, not 3 cases and one death as
given in the Agency report. Whatever the actual figures, it is clear that
the number of new cases and deaths from Marburg fever recorded in Angola is
declining, and the outbreak may now be coming under control. - Mod.CP]
