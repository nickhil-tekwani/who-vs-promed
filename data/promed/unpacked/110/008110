Correction to Avian influenza, human - East Asia (29)
---------------------------------------------------
I wish to point out a minor error in the posting Avian influenza, human -
East Asia (29). The moderator has said that the number of confirmed cases
in Viet Nam is 23, although this was revised down last week to 22 (one case
was reclassified from confirmed to probable after a review of laboratory
information held on cases of influenza A/H5 by the Ministry of Health of
Viet Nam and the WHO Country Office Viet Nam). Therefore the total number
of confirmed cases is 33 (number of deaths is the same).

Confirmed Human Cases of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus Infection
---------------------------------------------------
After a review of laboratory information held on cases of influenza A/H5 by
the Ministry of Health of Vietnam and the WHO Country Office Vietnam, one
case has been reclassified from confirmed to probable. This individual had
a high titre for H5 antibodies on sera collected 15 days after onset using
the microneutralization test.

[Therefore the revised situation is the following:
Country / Total Cases / Deaths
Thailand / 11 / 7
Viet Nam / 22 / 15
Total / 33 / 22
The total number of cases includes number of deaths. WHO reports only
laboratory-confirmed cases.
