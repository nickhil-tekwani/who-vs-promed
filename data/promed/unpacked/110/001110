The Broken Hills prairie dog colony at Grasslands National Park is being closed off to visitors after a prairie dog recently died from sylvatic plague. The park is located just outside of Val Marie in southwest Saskatchewan. Two dead ground squirrels were also discovered and have been sent for testing.

Sylvatic plague is a rare, but naturally occurring disease that affects wildlife in the region. Sylvatic plague is in the same bacterium that causes bubonic and pneumonic plague in humans [_Yersinia pestis_], but it poses very low risk to human health. It is extremely rare for humans to contract the disease. The last confirmed case of human infection in Canada was in 1939 and was not fatal.

"The safety of visitors and staff is Parks Canada's top priority. Grasslands National Park is collaborating with the appropriate provincial and federal government agencies to address this situation and ensure public safety," said a press release issued by Parks Canada.

Parks Canada staff are dusting burrows in the Broken Hills colony with the insecticide DeltaDust (deltamethrin) to mitigate the potential spread of the disease. The insecticide kills fleas that could carry the sylvatic plague. Parks Canada says it will be closely monitoring the prairie dog population and conduct further disease surveillance within the park.

The park itself will remain open. Other prairie dog colonies in the park are still accessible.

Since 2010, all prairie dog colonies in the Grasslands National park have been closed to domestic animals to prevent the possibility of pets carrying infected fleas back to their owners.

[Grasslands National Park is in SW Saskatchewan and close to the border with the US: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasslands_National_Park. Check out Val Marie, SK, on the FallingGrain map: http://www.fallingrain.com/world/CA/11/Val_Marie.html

The 2010 outbreak in the park was at the Larsen colony. Presumably the Broken Hills colony was _Yersinia pestis_ naive and when the infection found its way there, it found a ready home and announced itself with significant prairie dog deaths, though its presence has yet to be confirmed. We look forward to the results of the park surveillance.

Normally prairie dog sylvatic plague presents few risks to humans but if you see a dead prairie dog do not pick it up, keep your dog well away from it. As we know from affected states in the US cats can bring the fleas into the house so make sure that your cats have regular flea medicine to prevent any infestation. Plague is not called the 'black death' for nothing. It is not a fun disease though it responds well to antibiotics. - Mod.MHJ
