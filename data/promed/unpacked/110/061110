OFFLU keeps its pace on global sharing virus samples
----------------------------------------------------
OFFLU, the OIE/FAO joint network of expertise on avian influenza, will
systematically make avian influenza virus sequences accessible to the
entire scientific community. With this gesture, OFFLU reiterates its call
to world scientists, international organizations, and countries for a
global sharing of virus strains and sequences.
Since its launch in April 2005, OFFLU has been mainly working on promoting
the key objectives "to exchange scientific data and biological materials
(including virus strains) within the network and to share such information
with the wider scientific community." Under this new impetus, strains will
be sent to the National Institute for Health for sequencing and deposited
in full transparency on the free-access database, GenBank.
On 14 Mar 2006, the Scientific Committee of OFFLU, made up of world leading
veterinary experts on avian influenza, revised its terms of reference to
put new emphasis on the need for further collection, characterization and
exchange of avian influenza viruses and for the expansion of the genomic
database for animal influenza viruses.
Sharing virus strains, samples and sequences is a critical part of the
global work on the surveillance and control of the highly pathogenic H5N1
virus and supports the preparation of human vaccines. Avian influenza
brings long term implications for human health, and therefore OFFLU works
closely with the World Health Organization Working Group on Influenza
Research at the human-animal interface.
Virus strains can be considered as intellectual property, and sharing them
can be seen as potentially hampering research progress and scientific
publication. However, OFFLU went forward on 16 Feb 2006, when Dr Ilaria
Capua of the Italian Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie
(Italy) and chair of the Scientific Committee of OFFLU released sequence
data of the H5N1 virus found in Nigeria and Italy on GenBank. In the
meantime, she urged 50 colleagues around the world to share their isolated
H5N1 virus strains.
Scientists of the FAO/OIE network repeated their conviction in a letter
published by the review Science a few weeks later. "We will make available
for genome nucleotide sequencing of H5N1 contemporary isolates from several
countries and relevant historical strains," said Ilaria Capua and fellow
Drs Ian Brown, Michael Johnson, Dennis Senne, and David Swayne.
The stance taken by G8 leaders in Russia on global sharing of virus samples
further strengthens this daring initiative. In its statement on the fight
against infectious diseases, the Group of 8 declared being "determined to
achieve tangible progress in improved international cooperation on the
surveillance and monitoring of infectious diseases, including better
coordination between the animal and human health communities, building
laboratory capacities, and full transparency by all nations in sharing, on
a timely basis, virus samples in accordance with national and international
regulations and conventions, and other relevant information about the
outbreaks of diseases."

Indonesia: chickens test positive for bird flu
----------------------------------------------
Around 300 birds died of the virus over the past week in Bali's westernmost
Jembrana district. Indonesia, a vast archipelago comprising nearly 18 000
islands, has posted 42 human deaths since July 2005 and is tied with Viet
Nam as the world's hardest-hit country.
The World Health Organization [WHO] has said that limited human-to-human
transmission may have occurred in a family on Sumatra island, the location
of the world's largest cluster of human infections, the AP reports.
Health authorities were forced to cull large numbers of ducks and chickens
on Bali earlier this year [2006] after birds became ill.

[Indonesia has sent the OIE 8 follow-up reports since the beginning of
2005, 2 of them in 2006 (in January and April). The presence of H5N1 in
Bali was reported in once, namely in Badung district, November 2005.
The dissemination of avian influenza in Indonesia is displayed in WHO's
