Preliminary tests of ground squirrels found dead in desert areas of Ada and Elmore counties have come back positive for plague. Idaho public health and Idaho Fish and Game officials are asking people to take precautions as outdoor summer activities shift into high gear over the long Memorial Day [30 May 2016] weekend.

Last year [2015], plague was confirmed in ground squirrels in the same general areas of southern Idaho. Plague can circulate in wild animal populations every year. Confirmatory laboratory tests are being conducted, with results expected next week [week of 1 Jun 2016].

Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents that is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas and can cause serious illness to people and pets if not treated quickly. It also can be transmitted to people by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, rabbits and pets. Common rodents that can become infected include ground squirrels, rats, voles and mice. Tree squirrels in Idaho are not known to carry plague.

"Just like last year [2015], our investigation began in May after hearing reports from people finding dead ground squirrels in the desert southeast of Boise," State Wildlife Veterinarian Dr Mark Drew said. "We hope to have confirmation of these results soon and will keep the public up to date as we learn more."

People can greatly reduce their risk of becoming infected with plague by taking simple precautions, including avoiding contact with wild rodents, their fleas and rodent carcasses. Health officials recommend:
- do not feed rodents in picnic or campground areas and never handle sick or dead rodents;
- keep your pets from roaming and hunting ground squirrels or other rodents in affected desert areas;
- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on pets as not all products are safe for cats, dogs or children;
- clean up areas near your home where rodents can live, such as woodpiles;
- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian, especially if they may have had contact with sick or dead rodents in the desert areas south and east of Boise;
- see your doctor if you have any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever after being in a plague-impacted area;
- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;
- don't leave pet food and water where rodents or other wild animals can access them.

Symptoms of plague in humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and weakness. In most cases there is a painful swelling of the lymph node in the groin, armpit, or neck areas. Plague clinical signs in cats and dogs are fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite, with possible swelling in the lymph node under the jaw. With prompt diagnosis and appropriate antibiotic treatment, the fatality rate in people and pets can be greatly reduced. Physicians who suspect plague should promptly report it to their local public health district.

Idaho Fish and Game is interested in reports of multiple (greater than 5) dead ground squirrels, yellow-bellied marmots (aka "rock-chucks"), voles, cottontail rabbits, or jackrabbits. Please do not report single mortalities; observations of multiple mortalities are a greater indicator of possible plague activity. If people find groups of 5 or more dead animals listed above, they should not touch them, but should report the location to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game at https://idfg.idaho.gov/plague. All reports are reviewed and appropriately handled, however, not all people submitting reports will be contacted for follow-up.

Since 1940, only 5 human cases of plague have been reported in Idaho. The last 2 cases reported in Idaho occurred in 1991 and 1992, with both patients fully recovering. In 2015, a dog tested positive for plague after ground squirrel exposure. The dog recovered after medical treatment.

[2] Domestic cat

Elmore County [Idaho] Cat Likely Died of Plague
Ground Squirrel Plague Area of Impact Expanded to the East
----------------------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests indicate an Elmore County cat likely died from plague. The cat had contact with ground squirrels, also known as "whistle pigs," before becoming ill. Family members and other household pets are being monitored to ensure the cat did not spread the infection.

The cat lived outside of the initial area of impact identified in the [27 May 2016] press release about plague in ground squirrels; the cat resided approximately 3 miles west of the City of Mountain Home. Given the positive initial tests for plague in the cat, the area of impact has been expanded eastward into Elmore County (see enclosed map). People living or recreating in the area should take precautions.

Plague is transmitted through the bites of infected fleas and can cause serious illness to people and pets if not treated quickly. It also can be transmitted to people by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, rabbits and pets. Common rodents that can become infected include ground squirrels, rats, voles and mice. Tree squirrels in Idaho are not known to carry plague.

"This is a reminder that whether you live in the area of impact or recreate there, it is very important to take precautions to avoid contact with ground squirrels and their potentially infected fleas. Make sure your pets have proper flea control. Do not let your pets touch ground squirrels in the affected area. People can be exposed to plague when pets bring infected fleas back into the home, by caring for a sick pet without proper precautions, or by contact with rodents carrying fleas," said Sarah Correll, Epidemiologist for Central District Health Department.

Earlier this week, official lab tests confirmed plague infection in ground squirrel die-offs found in desert areas south of Boise and west of Mountain Home.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.
