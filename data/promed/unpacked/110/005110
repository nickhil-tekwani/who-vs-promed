U.S. agronomists say wheat producers have more than a drought
affecting their yields this year [2006], as various viruses invade crops.
Texas Agricultural Experiment Station researcher Tom Allen, a plant
disease diagnostician, said he saw more than 150 wheat samples sent
to the Great Plains Diagnostic Network lab this growing season, in
addition to 400-plus samples the plant pathology staff gathered
across the Panhandle.
Ninety-five percent of the samples were diagnosed with the wheat
streak mosaic virus. The virus is vectored by the wheat curl mite,
Allen said, and so far there's no treatment for either the virus or the mite.
The samples came from as far north as Nebraska and as far south as
Dallas, said plant pathologist Charlie Rush, making the outbreak the
most widespread in years for wheat streak mosaic damage.
"We don't have a good understanding of the wheat curl mite and its
ecology," Rush said. "There are big gaps in our knowledge. But we
have things working in the field that should provide answers in the
next couple of years."

[The cereal crop plant wheat, _Triticum aestivum_ L. subsp.
_aestivum_, develops symptoms of the disease wheat streak mosaic when
infected by wheat streak mosaic virus (genus: _Tritimovirus_, family:
_Potyviridae_, WSMV). It can also infect barley, maize, oats and rye
and some pasture and weed grasses. The virus is transmitted by the
eriophyid wheat curl mite (_Aceria tosichella_). WSMV causes severe
disease in some winter wheat crops in the Great Plains of North
America, with average losses of 3 percent. There is one report
(Argentina, 20040922.2614) from South America. It occurs throughout
the Mediterranean Basin at low incidence and is reported from Eastern
Europe and Australia.
This report confirms the expected occurrence of WSMV in the Great
Plains of North America. The incidence in the 2006 season is stated
as being the most widespread in years for wheat streak mosaic damage,
making this article noteworthy.
