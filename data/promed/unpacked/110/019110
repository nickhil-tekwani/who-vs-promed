The gray fox that attacked 2 Londonderry [Windham county, Vermont] residents on [Sat 29 Apr 2017] has tested positive for rabies.

The fox had been sighted multiple times across Londonderry, and the animal's suspicious behavior led local officials to suspect it was rabid.

"We had 2 unprovoked attacks by a fox on humans and they both happened on the same day," said Kevin Beattie, Londonderry's emergency management director. "They were both in the same fairly small area, so we were pretty sure it was the same fox that did both attacks."

[BC] was the fox's 1st victim, taken by surprise outside of her mother's house in Londonderry. "I was texting my daughter, and the next thing I knew I had a fox attached to my leg," said [BC]. "It came out of nowhere. I never saw it until it was on me."

"I was able to turn quickly to get it off me, but it jumped on me again and bit me on the knee," said [BC]. "By then I had fallen on the ground and was able to kick it."

As the bite had broken her skin, [BC] was rushed to the emergency room for a series of rabies shots. "It did act strangely," said [BC]. "Had I known, or had I seen it, I would have run for the house."

Soon after, Londonderry's game warden David Taddei pulled into [BP's] residence to warn him of the attack. About an hour later, while [BP] and his family were playing wiffle ball in their yard, the fox struck again.

"I just happened to be about 10 or 15 feet from my 5 year old and saw it running toward him," said [BP]. "It nipped at the right side of his belly, and I just reacted and was able to kick the fox off of him."

Having put their 3 dogs inside just moments prior, [BP] yelled to his girlfriend to get the kids indoors.

"My girlfriend grabbed the 5 year old and ran into the car, and the 9 year old ran inside," said [BP]. "My friend was able to give the fox a soccer kick, and it ran over to our play set."

Having been informed of the earlier attack on [BC], [BP] knew that he had to act quickly.

"The minute I saw it I knew it was the same fox, and it wasn't getting out of there alive," said [BP]. "There was a shovel nearby, so when the fox began to crawl out from under the playset I hit it and it just dropped."

The game warden immediately had the animal tested for rabies, and on [Tue 2 May 2017] those results came back positive.

"This type of aggressive unprovoked attack is rather unusual even for rabid animals," said Beattie. "We haven't seen any more animals that are acting strangely since then, or had another incident fortunately."

Immediately following Saturday's [29 Apr 2017] attacks Beattie put out a public notice on Londonderry's community forum on Facebook, as well as to his e-mail list of about 600 residents. Following Tuesday's [2 May 2017] positive test results, officials sent out a 2nd notice.

"The chances of another rabies infected animal in the area are hard to predict but definitely possible," read the notice from the State Veterinarian and the Game Warden. "Be observant and watch for wild animals that may be acting unusual."

While such aggressive attacks are uncommon, sightings of rabid animals are not. So far there have been 2 reported cases of rabid animals this year [2017] in Bennington County, both in Manchester. In 2016 there were 10 confirmed cases of rabid animals in Bennington County, though more unconfirmed cases are likely.

"I think it's very traumatic that the 5 year old did get attacked, but at the end of the day the outcome was good," said BP. "We were able to get the fox so it couldn't hurt anyone else."

Both victims of Saturday's [29 Apr 2017] attack are receiving treatment, and are expected to make a full recovery.

[2] Illinois: bat, possible human exposure
Date: Fri 28 Apr 2017

http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/5-Girls-Playing-With-Rabid-Bat--420767153.html


The 5 children who were seen playing with a rabid bat have been identified and referred to the Cook County Health Department for follow up.

Earlier this week 5 young girls were spotted playing with what turned out to be a live bat that tested positive for rabies in [La Grange Park, Cook County].

While it's not known if the girls actually touched the animal -- identifying them and getting them checked out became critical for health officials. Health officials say coming in contact with the saliva of the bats can be extremely dangerous and even deadly.

Rabies is a virus that affects the central nervous system. You can contract it from a bite, scratch, or even saliva from an infected animal. If untreated, rabies can be fatal.

In [La Grange Park], health officials offered a warning that has some parents on alert.

"Bats have really tiny jaws and its not always obvious when someone has been bitten," says Demian Christiansen of the Cook County Department of Public Health. "Since rabies is fatal, we really don't want to take any chances."

The girls have all been located and referred to the health department. It's unclear if they were exposed to rabies.

"I'm glad the health department stepped in and hopefully nothing bad will come out of it," [a parent] said. She faced a similar situation when one of her daughters found a dead rabbit and brought it to school. We had to go to the doctor," she recalled. "We went through a little ordeal -- cause it's scary."

Health officials say you should not handle bats whether they are dead or alive. If you see a bat, call your area's animal control, officials say.

http://cbs6albany.com/news/local/columbia-county-issues-rabies-warning


The Columbia County Department of Health (CCDOH) is warning people not to handle, capture or attempt to confine any wild animals.

It's due to recent incidents involving contact between county residents and animals that have tested positive for the rabies virus. Recent cases cited by the agency include exposure to a rabid fox and raccoon.

The DOH says not only does attempting to handle wild animals pose a health risk, it is illegal under New York State law. CCDOH hosts several free rabies clinics for cats, dogs, and ferrets throughout the year to keep animals safe.

There is no charge to Columbia County residents, however donations are accepted.

The next rabies vaccination clinic for 2017 has been scheduled for:
[Sat 6 May 2017] Gallatin Town Highway Garage County Routes 8 & 11
Cats and Ferrets 10:00 - 11:00
Dogs 11:00 -12:00 Copake Vets

Dates and times for additional rabies clinics are available on the Columbia County Department of Health website (http://www.columbiacountyny.com; select "Department Links" to find the Health Department), or by calling the Health Department at (518)828-3358.

[4] Iowa: feline, human exposure
Date: Tue 18 Apr 2017

http://globegazette.com/news/local/north-iowans-undergo-rabies-vaccinations-after-cat-bite/article_838447d1-1cd5-5319-888a-c5974a39a283.html


Multiple North Iowans were vaccinated for rabies after someone was bitten by a cat infected with the virus. The exposure happened earlier this month [April 2017] in rural Mitchell County.

Veterinarian Dennis Riley said the animal was brought in for examination at Osage Veterinary Clinic, where it was euthanized due to its deteriorating condition and suspicion of rabies. He said the owners took the animal's body to the State Hygienic Lab in Iowa City, where test results confirmed it was positive for rabies.

"It was a semi-feral cat -- they fed it outside -- and went out to feed it and it just out of the blue, no provocation or anything, (it) jumped up and bit (the person) in the hand and in the leg," Riley said.

Rabies virus attacks the nervous system. It is fatal if untreated.

The person who was bitten and others who may have been exposed underwent post-exposure rabies vaccinations, Riley said.

An estimated 400 Iowans undergo post-exposure vaccinations annually, but Iowa Department of Public Health Veterinarian Ann Garvey said actual infections are rare.

"We don't have Iowans that come down with rabies often at all," she said. "Our last known rabies case occurred in 2002 and that was an individual that was infected with rabies that came from a bat, and prior to that we haven't had a case in Iowa since 1951."

Garvey and Iowa Department of Public Health Spokesperson Polly Carver-Kimm would not comment on the Mitchell County exposure. Citing department policy, they would not confirm the exposure happened, how many people were exposed or if anyone sought medical treatment.

Officials at Mitchell County Home Health Care & Public Health also wouldn't release information about the incident. Reports of infected animals and possible exposures are reported through Iowa's public health system.

Skunks and bats are the primary carriers in North Iowa, but cats, dogs, and other domesticated animals, including livestock, can become infected and transmit the disease to humans.

It's typically transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal. That's usually through a bite, but infection also can spread if the sick animal's saliva gets into an open wound or mucus membranes in the eyes, nose, and mouth, Garvey said.

[5] California: bat, unknown human exposure

http://www.satprnews.com/2017/04/18/bat-found-inside-safari-park-tests-positive-for-rabies/


A bat found at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park has tested positive for rabies, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency reported.

The bat was found alive on [Sat 15 Apr 2017] at approximately 3 p.m. near the Oasis Deli in Nairobi Village of the park. Trained park staff collected the bat, which was not one of the park's collection animals and delivered it to the county where it tested positive [Mon 17 Apr 2017] for rabies.

So far, no human or animal contact has been reported. However, County health officials would like to know if anyone who was in the park on 15 Apr 2017 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. directly handled the rabid bat. If you or someone in your family or group had contact with the bat, you are urged to contact the County Health officials as soon as possible at (619) 692-8499. If you did not have direct contact with the bat, such as touching or holding the animal, you are not at risk for rabies.

"Although the bat was found in an area where many park visitors pass by, there has been no reported human or animal contact with it," said Wilma Wooten, MD, MPH, County public health officer. "We want to be sure that no one had contact with the bat because human rabies is usually fatal without prompt post-exposure vaccine and treatment."

Rabies transmission can occur from a bat bite or if a bat's saliva comes in contact with a cut or abrasion, or with mucous membranes, such as the eyes, nose, or mouth. Including the bat reported today [18 Apr 2017], there have been 5 rabid bats found in San Diego County so far this year [2017]. 2 rabid bats were also found at this location in the Safari Park last summer [2016] and no direct human contact was reported at that time as well.

"People should always stay away from bats and other wild animals to prevent possible exposure to rabies," said Wooten. "If you see a bat, dead or alive, don't touch it. If you think you may have had contact with a bat, call the County as soon as possible at (619) 692-8499."

Rabies in humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild, stray, and unknown domestic animals, ensuring pets are up-to-date on rabies vaccinations, and receiving prompt medical advice following animal bites and other significant exposures to potentially rabid animals.

If direct contact with a bat does occur, wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and water and get medical advice immediately. More information on rabies, including a brochure on rabies, can be found on the San Diego Health and Human Services Agency's Rabies webpage http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/hhsa/programs/phs/community_epidemiology/dc/rabies.html.

[6] Delaware: feline, human exposure
Date: Wed 5 Apr 2017 727 PM EDT

http://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/health/2017/04/05/cat-tests-positive-rabies-bridgeville-area/100098258/


A cat that tested positive for rabies has been euthanized after coming into contact with at least one person and possibly infecting others in the Bridgeville area [Sussex County], according to authorities.

The Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH) warned residents of Main Street and the intersecting roads of Fawn Road and Redden Road that the DPH lab had found the animal to be rabid on Wednesday. The cat is the 1st lab-confirmed rabies case of the year [2017] in which humans may have been exposed, officials said. Since January [2017], DPH has performed rabies tests on 23 animals, 3 of which were confirmed to be rabid, including the cat, 1 raccoon, and 1 dog.

[...]

Health officials ask those who think they might have been bitten, scratched or come in contact with the rabid cat's saliva or that of another feral in the area to immediately contact their health care provider or call the DPH Rabies Program at (302) 744-4995.

Health officials said traps were being placed in the area to catch any feral cats that may have been exposed. Health officials say residents should take precautions against rabies by:
- avoiding wild and feral animals;
- ensuring their pets are up to date with rabies shots;
- keeping pets indoors or, while outside, supervising them on a leash;

Warm spring and summer temperatures lead to more outdoor activities, which increases possible exposure to rabies through contact with animals such as bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes.

Rabies in humans and animals cannot be cured once symptoms or signs appear. If the animal is of unknown origin or unavailable to be quarantined or tested, the Division of Public Health recommends people receive post exposure prophylaxis treatment, a series of 4 vaccinations, as a precautionary measure.

Health officials recommend members of the public help prevent the spread of rabies by vaccinating all pets and livestock. All dogs, cats, and ferrets 6 months and older are required by Delaware law to be vaccinated against rabies. Vaccinating valuable livestock and horses also should be considered. Animals that have frequent contact with humans should be vaccinated.

Here are some tips:
- pet owners can reduce the possibility of pets being exposed to rabies by not letting them roam free;
- spaying or neutering pets may reduce the tendency to roam or fight and thus reduce the chance they will be exposed to rabies;
- do not feed or water your pets outdoors; bowls can attract wild and stray animals;
- keep your garbage securely covered;
- do not handle unfamiliar animals, including cats, and dogs, even if they appear friendly.

For more information on the Delaware Division of Public Health's rabies program, visit http://www.dhss.delaware.gov/dhss/dph/dpc/rabies.html or call (866) 972-9705 or (302) 744-4995. For more information on rabies, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/.

[7] Mexico (Yucatan): canine, human exposure
Date: Wed 12 Apr 2017
Source: The Yucatan Times [edited]
http://www.theyucatantimes.com/2017/04/health-authorities-find-an-outbreak-of-rabies-in-progreso/


After confirming a positive case of canine rabies, found by the Central Regional Laboratory of Mérida on [Fri 7 April 2017, the Yucatán Health Secretariat (Secretaría de Salud de Yucatán, SSY, in Spanish) established an operation for its control in the municipality of Progreso.

The state coordinator of the SSY Zoonosis Program, Daly Gabino Martínez Ortiz, said that the head of the unit, Jorge Mendoza Mézquita, ordered the immediate application of the procedures from the guide for the care of rabies and NOM-011-SSA2-2011 (Mexican standard normative for rabies control), for the prevention and containment of human rabies, as well as in dogs and cats.

Martínez Ortiz detailed that it was a 3 year old female pit bull dog, owned by a man from the zone, which had positive [results] to the application of direct immunofluorescence technique. [Rabies is tested in deceased animals, not living animals. - Mod.TG]

Its owner revealed that he adopted the animal when it was a month old and did not have the current vaccination. He explained that when he was handling the pet, it caused him a shoulder injury, so he already receives the indicated treatment.

The official remarked how important vaccination is to dogs' health and urged people not to lower their guard or neglect the care and feeding of these animals, especially in the seasons of very high temperatures.

The preventive actions in Progreso include a vaccination campaign for all the dogs and cats of that area.

On 30 Mar 2017, another case of rabies was reported, at that time in the town of Hoctún [Yucatán]. The specimen was a 5 month old dog, that had not been vaccinated, also owned by a family from the town, the reason why the SSY arranged an operation of vaccination in an area up to 5 kilometers [3.1 mi] radius of the municipality.

Martínez Ortiz added that, according to the regulations, these activities were extended to the towns of Xocchel and Tahmek [Yucatán], where anti-rabies vaccination is carried out at each house of the both towns.

He also noted that at Hoctún there have been detected 4 contacts with humans, 1 of which was accidentally with the animal's snout, which caused an injury in the right hand of the affected. For all cases, the corresponding treatment has already begun.

The last outbreak of this disease in Yucatan was recorded in the town of Seyé, in 2014.

It was refreshing to see some of these articles reminding people to vaccinate their animals, including livestock and horses. I also noted ferrets are included in some of these articles.

Sadly, some communities in this update are still not promoting vaccination of pets, even when there are known rabid animals in the area.

It is interesting to see Mexican officials go house to house to investigate vaccination and exposure. Requirements to vaccinate against rabies, record keeping by veterinarians, and sending out reminders are ways they could help decrease the rabies prevalence. For those traveling to resort regions in Mexico, be alert for possibly rabid animals. - Mod.TG]
