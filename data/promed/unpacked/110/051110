ST. LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS, DIAGNOSIS: REQUEST FOR INFO

I am interested to know if preliminary published experience with PCR
detection of arboviral infections from cerebral spinal fluid has continued
to show promise and whether it is being used in the present New York
outbreak. This early data were reported from the New York State Dept. of
Health (Huang, et al.) and the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious
Diseases, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Ft
Collins--and I would suspect both of these centers are involved in the
present outbreak. Does anyone have any further information?
