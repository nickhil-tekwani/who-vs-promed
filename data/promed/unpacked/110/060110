Poland's chief vet: another BSE case reported
---------------------------------------------
Poland's chief vet Piotr Kolodziej has said that another case of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) has been reported in Poland. The
slaughterhouse where the BSE case was detected has been disinfected. The
BSE infected cow came from a big herd in the Kluczbork county (Opole
province). It was the offspring of a cow imported from the Netherlands that
is alive and has no signs of the illness. The herd is composed of 400 cows
and there are other 800 linked with it, so we are still to decide what to
do. Some of the cows will be put to sleep and some will probably be put
under observation. The detection of another BSE case did not surprise us.
It was known that such a thing could happen. This case is connected with
the biggest herd so far.
