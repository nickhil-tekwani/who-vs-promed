[The final notification above, combined with a circular distributed on
12 Sep 2011 to Israel's veterinarians and animal breeders (in Hebrew,
available at
http://www.vetserv.moag.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/A86B57DD-C254-48BA-8B47-E4E98B26B1C5/0/hozer_dever_tzon.pdf)
include information requested in ProMED-mail's posting 20110908.2742,
as follows:
1. Age distribution: the unit included 6 female and one male adult
sheep, and 48 5-7 month old lambs.
2. Vaccination status: unvaccinated
3. The source of the lambs could not be established.
4. Testing policy: the diagnosis was based upon clinical investigation
(typical signs) and PCR-testing of conjunctival swabs, found
positive.

We are told that the PPR sequence was found similar to virulent field
isolates from Turkey and India (sequencing carried out by the
molecular virology department at the Kimron Veterinary Institute).

The decision by the Israeli Veterinary Services to apply stamping out,
destroying the entire unit, is to be viewed in light of the fact that
this was the 1st PPR outbreak since February 2006. Hopefully, such
measure, combined with the continued routine application of mass
vaccinations with the homologous PPR vaccine (introduced in February
2006), and control upon animal movements, will prevent additional
cases. A graph showing PPR in Israel since its 1st introduction in
1993, is available in the circular of 12 Sep 2011 (URL above). -
