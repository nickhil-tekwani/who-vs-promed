Outbreak update - Cholera in Yemen, 16 Jun 2019
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health and Population of Yemen reported 20 264 suspected cases of cholera with 15 associated deaths during epidemiological week 24 (10-16 Jun) of 2019, with 14% of cases reported as severe. The cumulative total number of suspected cholera cases from 1 Jan 2018 to 16 Jun 2019 is 779 849, with 1178 associated deaths (CFR 0.15%). Children under 5 represent 22.7% of total suspected cases during 2019. In 2019 the outbreak has affected 22 of 23 governorates and 299 of 333 districts in Yemen.

From week 8 in 2019, the trend of weekly reported suspected cholera cases started increasing and peaked at more than 29 500 cases in week 14. During weeks 15-21, case numbers went down; however, from week 22-24 the trend of suspected cases increased again. The governorates reporting the highest number of suspected cases of cholera during 2019 were Amanat Al Asimah (62 807), Sana'a (50 072), Al Hudaydah (43 494), Ibb (37 848), Hajjah (37 777), and Dhamar (36 830).

Of a total 6536 samples tested since January 2019, 3479 have been confirmed as cholera-positive by culture at the central public health laboratories. During this period, the governorates reporting the highest numbers of positive culture were Amanat al Asimah (1029), Taizz (817), and Sana'a (395). WHO continues to provide leadership and support for activities with health authorities and partners to respond to this ongoing cholera outbreak, including case management; surveillance and laboratory investigations; hotspot mapping and OCV campaign planning; water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH); and risk communication.

[The calculated case fatality rate from this is quite low, strongly suggesting that many of the cases are not cholera. Even with that, the numbers reported in this continuing catastrophe are difficult to wrap one's head around. - Mod.LL
