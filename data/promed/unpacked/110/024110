Outbreak of Bacterial Kidney Disease in fish [in Hampshire]
---------------------------------------------------------
The presence of Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD) has been confirmed in
a trout farm in Hampshire.
The UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has
issued an Order under the Diseases of Fish Act 1937, prohibiting all
movements of fish to and from the infected Fish Farm.
The disease was found in a trout sample taken as a result of an
investigation into an outbreak at another farm. Whilst the disease is
considered serious and notifiable under EU law, it is not widespread
in Great Britain and occurs only sporadically.
BKD has no implications for human health.
Notes to editors
--------------
The Diseases of Fish (Designated Areas) (England) (No. 6) Order 2006
restricts the movement of any live fish or live eggs of fish into or
out of the designated area without the prior written consent of Defra.
The designated area is Greatbridge (Test Valley Trout), The Island,
Greatbridge, Romsey, Hampshire. SO51 0HP. [See map at
<http://www.multimap.com/map/browse.cgi?lat=50.989&lon=-1.4966&scale=1000000&icon=x>].
Further information on BKD and other serious freshwater diseases can
be found on the Defra website in its Combating Fish Disease
publication. Our sister site,
<http://www.efishbusiness.co.uk>
also provides a wealth of information on fish health matters.
To organize a fish health inspection on suspicion of an outbreak,
contact the CEFAS Fish Health Inspectorate on 01305 206673/74 or by
sending an email to: <fish.health.inspectorate@cefas.co.uk>
This new DAO will come into force on 18 Jul 2006.
Fish infected with BKD may display a number of characteristics
including protruding eyes, a swollen abdomen, pale anemic gills and
hemorrhaging at the base of the gills. Anyone suspicious of a
possible outbreak of BKD or who have noticed signs similar to these,
should immediately contact the Fish Health Inspectorate at CEFAS Weymouth.
BKD can cause large numbers of mortalities in both farmed and wild
salmon and trout. It was first recognized in Atlantic salmon on the
River Dee, Scotland in the 1930s, and in 1976 there was the 1st
notable case of BKD in farmed rainbow trout. Whilst the disease is
considered serious and notifiable under EU law, it is not widespread
in Great Britain and occurs only sporadically.
