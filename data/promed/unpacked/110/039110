Virulent MRSA strains containing the Panton Valentine Leukocidin gene
in the Netherlands
-------------------
Methicillin resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ (MRSA) strains
possessing the Panton Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) gene have been
detected in the Netherlands recently. The PVL gene encodes a highly
potent toxin, which is involved in severe skin infections and
necrotising pneumonia. PVL-positive MRSA strains have also been noted
in France (in healthy individuals; mean age 14 years), in the United
States (for example, in the Los Angeles gay community, and in a large
prison), and in Scotland (small outbreaks of skin abscesses in
healthcare staff. The Scottish MRSA reference laboratory is now
routinely screening both methicillin susceptible _S. aureus_ (MSSA)
and MRSA for the PVL gene). It has been suggested that the PVL MRSA
is acquired in the community (1-3).
The PVL gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (1) in
approximately 10 percent of all MRSA isolates sent to the Dutch
institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) national
surveillance program in the period 2000-2003. Molecular subtyping by
pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) on the Dutch strains has
shown a predominant clone, PFGE cluster 28. Although this clone is
known to be epidemic in the Netherlands, it has not caused large
outbreaks so far. The PFGE pattern of cluster 28 appears to be
identical to the pattern of the French PVL MRSA clone.
Identical PVL MRSA isolates (PFGE cluster 206) were found recently in
2 Dutch HIV-positive homosexual men. It is not yet known whether
there is a link with the PVL MRSA strains isolated from men who have
sex with men in the USA.
About 90 percent of the PVL-positive MRSA isolates in the Netherlands
have been obtained from soft tissue infections and (deep) purulent
wound infections, compared with 30 percent for PVL-negative MRSA
isolates. This significant increase in the seriousness of infections
caused by PVL MRSA is a finding shared by the French group (1). The
predominant Dutch clone (cluster 28) has so far been shown to be 100
percent resistant to fusidic acid, neomycin, and tetracycline. When
testing all the PVL strains (cluster 28 plus others) the resistance
percentages are approximately 60, 70, and 70, respectively. The
cluster 28 clone in particular has a characteristic antibiotic
resistance profile, which can be of use in the clinical laboratory.
Further studies will be performed in order to gain more insight into
the microbiological and epidemiological background of these virulent
MRSA strains. The combination of the PVL gene (virulence) and mecA
gene (resistance) and proven epidemicity (cluster 28) makes this a
well-adapted pathogen, which can have severe implications, especially
if further resistance markers are acquired.

[As mentioned in our earlier discussions, the appearance in a
high-risk group such as the gay community boded badly for possible
rapid spread. This report supports that concern. MRSA may be joining
the list of sexually transmitted diseases currently amongst men who
have sex with men, but is likely to enter the heterosexual community
in the future. - Mod.MPP]
