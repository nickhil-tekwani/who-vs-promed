On 5 Dec [2013], the National Reference Centre for arboviruses (IRBA, Marseille) reported 2 cases of chikungunya virus infection on the Franco-Dutch island of St Martin/St Maarten. The virus is transmitted locally by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_.

Also reported were 2 cases in Martinique, while others are awaiting confirmation on the islands of Guadeloupe and St Barthelemy. This is the 1st time that this virus has been detected in the Americas, and its dissemination is being followed carefully.

The genome of this virus has been completely sequenced from clinical samples and then from virus isolated in cell culture (the complete sequence is available on the website of the European virus collection at European Virus Archive http://www.european-virus-archive.com). It is a strain of Asian genotype, so it is different from that which caused the 2006 outbreak in Reunion Island and then spread throughout the Indian Ocean.

These results were obtained very quickly thanks to the collaboration between the National Reference Center for Arboviruses (IRBA, Marseille) and UMR 190 "Emerging Viral Diseases" (Aix-Marseille University - Institute for Research and Development - Graduate School of Public Health, Marseille), members of the IHU-Mediterranean Infection.

The national reference center of Marseille has confirmed the 1st indigenous case of chikungunya in Guadeloupe. This is a child, treated by his doctor, and, as of today [24 Dec 2013], he no longer has any clinical signs.

The Agency for Health Guadeloupe, St Martin and St Barthelemy, and Cire Antilles Guyane (Institut National de Veille Sanitaire - French Institute for Public Health Surveillance) reinforced entomological and epidemiological surveillance and vector control around the case [location].

A communication campaign in the written press has already been launched and will be enhanced by a wide dissemination of radio spots, posters and flyers.

This campaign is a continuation of the measures taken on St Martin after the occurrence of the 1st cases on 6 Dec [2013].

[Chikungunya virus continues to spread in the Caribbean. The abundance of the mosquito vector, _Aedes aegypti_ and inter-island movement of people who may be viremic will make it difficult to stop. Health authorities on the affected and nearby islands are taking the situation seriously by intensifying surveillance and launching public education efforts.

An earlier report indicated that a case also occurred on Martinique. The origin of the Caribbean outbreak on St Martin has not been identified. Since the sequences of the St Martin chikungunya virus isolates indicate that it is of Asian origin, it would be of interest to know exactly where it came from and how it arrived on St Martin.
