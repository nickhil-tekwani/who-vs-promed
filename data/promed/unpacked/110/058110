Diphtheria outbreak in Zhare Dasht IDP camp, southern Afghanistan
-------------------------------------------------
The residents of Zhare Dasht camp in Kandahar province, southern
Afghanistan are facing an outbreak of diphtheria. Information on the first
cases in Zhare Dasht emerged on 14 Jul 2003, one death had already
occurred, with a further 2 in the days that immediately followed.
Up until 2 Aug 2003, 40 cases of diphtheria have been clinically diagnosed.
Meanwhile about half of the cases are laboratory-confirmed. Three children
died in the first days of the outbreak .
34/40 (85 percent) of the affected patients are between 5 and 18 years old,
while 5/40 (12.5 percent) are over 18 years (including one patient of 40
years). All cases except one have a history of no vaccination.
Medecins sans Frontieres-Holland (MSF-H) started a vaccination campaign on
3 Aug 2003 to cover the age groups 5 years and up, including adults, in
addition to its routine EPI services for under 5 years provided in the
clinics of the camp. The camp population is around 40 000 people. Both DT
and low-dose Td vaccine are being used, the latter for immunization of
children of 7 years and older and adults.
Case management is being done with diphtheria anti-toxin alongside with
antibiotics, which eliminate the organism and prevent its spread. During
the initial days of the outbreak, treatment in Afghanistan was impossible,
as the anti-toxin could not be found in country. Within days however, WHO
managed to source and transport the anti-toxin to Kandahar and MSF began
treatment for the diphtheria patients.
Patients are initially isolated in MSF's basic health care unit in Zhare
Dasht. They are then transferred to the Infectious Diseases Ward in
Kandahar city hospital, where MSF is working in support of the Ministry of
Health. Patients are kept in an isolation ward, where they can be treated
by MSF, and then kept in hospital for a further period of monitoring. Local
authorities are making plans to transfer patients to an isolation unit in
the camp out of fear for further spread of the disease. Given the level of
complexity and potential complications of the treatment, concerns exist
about the level of care that can be given in the setting of a camp for the
displaced. In the past few days 2 suspected cases from the districts in
Kandahar province have been identified.
Meanwhile in Zhare Dasht camp, MSF, along with other NGO partners working
in the camp, are disseminating health education messages and administering
antibiotic prophylaxis to close contacts of diphtheria patients in an
attempt to try and further prevent spread of the disease, which is
transmitted through person-to-person contact. The cramped conditions of a
camp, with many family members living under the same roof, are ideal for
the transmission of an infectious disease such as diphtheria.
MSF-H has been working with the population of Zhare Dasht since their
arrival in August 2002, providing basic health care, mother and child
health, reproductive health, EPI, nutrition activities, and a TB cohort.
MSF has been present in the Infectious Diseases Ward in Kandahar city
hospital, where the diphtheria patients are currently undergoing treatment,
since 1999.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Joost van der Meer and Vickie Hawkins for
submission of this excellent report to ProMED-mail for posting.
In a November/December 2002 WHO report
(<http://www.who.int/disasters/repo/8806.html>), there is mention of a
cluster of 4 cases of diphtheria in Mazar in the Northern Area of the
country. At the same time there was an ongoing outbreak of pertussis in
Badakhshan province (115 clinically confirmed cases including 17 deaths),
Baghlan province (5 villages of Dushi district reportedly had been
affected, including 2 villages where an investigation team could confirm
clinically using the WHO case definition 104 cases including 2 deaths), and
Sar-I-Pul province (unverified reports).
These outbreaks (diphtheria and pertussis ) in Afghanistan and the age
distribution of the diphtheria cases, as presented in the current report
from MSF (85 percent of cases in the 5-18 year-old age group), suggest that
immunization activities have been sub-optimal in the country for many
years, with the older age groups highly susceptible to disease. The paucity
of cases of diphtheria in the less than five year old population may be a
result of the routine immunization activities aimed at that population
group in the camps, as well as the special immunization activities
conducted during the pertussis outbreak last year. - Mod.MPP]
