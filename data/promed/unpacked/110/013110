A World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating an extended outbreak
of human monkeypox in Kasai Oriental, Democratic Republic of the Congo, has
identified 419 suspect cases. This brings the total of suspect cases
reported since February 1996 to 511. Of the 419 suspect cases identified
during the October mission, 22 percent were identified as primary
infections, with the remainder defined as secondary. In this outbreak, the
symptoms of the clinical disease were milder, but the household secondary
attack rate was higher than previously documented. The latter may have
been due to an increase in the number of susceptible individuals after the
cessation of vaccinia vaccination, rather than an increase in
person-to-person transmission.
The investigating team included members from the Republic of Congo national
government, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre in London, Epicentre in Paris, the
European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology Training in Brussels, and
WHO in Geneva and Kinshasa. Results of the final analysis, when available,
will be published simultaneously in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report, the EuroSurveillance Bulletin, and the WHO Weekly Epidemiological
Record.
