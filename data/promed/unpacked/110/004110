CYSTICERCOSIS SEROLOGY - REQUEST FOR INFO

We have received a request for help from Stuart A. Kirsch
<<skirsch@umich.edu> via Leslie Marshall <<leslie-marshall@UIOWA.EDU>, on
behalf of Stephen Flew, Tabubil Health Centre, PO BOX 1 TABUBIL, WP, Papua
New Guinea, <<Flew.Stephen.S@bhp.com.au>, and Akira Ito, Department of
Parasitology, Gifu University School of Medicine, Gifu 500, Japan
<<akiraito@cc.gifu-u.ac.jp>.
Stephen Flew is looking for cystic fluid from tapeworm (_Taenia solium_)
infested pigs to run tests for cysticercosis on PNG populations living along
the border. Apparently infestation is quite widespread in Irian Jaya now
and he is trying to track its possible spread into PNG. He has some 500 or
so sera from the lower Ok Tedi villages which he wishes to test for
cysticercosis antibodies. Akira Ito from Japan is willing to do the
serology but he needs some more cystic fluid from pigs to make his antigens
as his supply is extremely limited.
Would anyone able to help Flew or Akira with cystic fluid, please contact
them directly.
Akira Ito provided the following insight into his test: "I have been doing
serodiagnostic work on echinococcosis and cysticercosis as international
collaboration projects sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Japan, from
1994. I found extremely good specific antigens for neurocysticercosis [NCC]
in humans and pigs and submitted the original paper to American Journal of
Tropical Medicine and Hygiene. The title is 'Novel antigens for
neurocysticercosis: simple method for preparation and evaluation for
serodiagnosis' by Ito, Plancarte, Ma, Kong, Flisser, Cho, Liu, Kamhawi,
Lightowlers and Schantz. Using my new antigens, it is very easy to do ELISA
with the same reliability to immunoblot. More details may be obtained
through Don. [Don McManus, Brisbane] My antigen is absolutely better than
that by Dr. Tsang. He recognized the difference already. My group with
Indonesian colleagues have done seroepidemiological work on cysticercosis
already in Irian Jaya and found that it is spreading wider.
Approximately 70 % of suspected NCC (due to epileptic seizures) and
cysticercosis (due to subcutaneous nodules) were absolutely due to
cysticercosis. Furthermore more than 10 % of normal people at risk also
found already infected with _T. solium_ serologically. Most of these cases
have been followed up in Irian Jaya and found to have some symptoms. I am
preparing a paper on this evidence. You may read my short report entitled
"Taeniasis/Cysticercosis in Indonesia as an emerging disease" in
Parasitology Today 13, 321-323."
