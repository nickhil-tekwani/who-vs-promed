There has been an increase in the number of people suffering from
water-borne diseases [in Fiji].

The General Manager Community Health Central/Eastern, Dr Solo
Qaranivalu, said that they have received reports of an increase in
diarrhea and viral infection cases from Rewa, Tailevu and Naitasiri,
with one reported case of leptospirosis in each of these 3
localities. He said that 137 people were seen by doctors for viral
infection in the 3 areas.

Meanwhile, the Divisional Medical Officer Western, Doctor Tharid Ali,
has also reported an increase in diarrhea cases in the western
division after the flood.

In the Northern Division, a few cases of leptospirosis have been
reported, and people all around the country, mainly in the flood
affected areas, have been asked to boil all drinking water and not to
go outside without shoes to avoid getting sick.

[Leptospirosis may occur sporadically or as large outbreaks during
periods of flooding. The cyclone season in Fiji is from November to
April, with greatest frequency in January and February. In January
2009, cyclone Gene and tropical storms caused widespread flooding
across the Fiji archipelago of more than 300 islands, scattered
across 200 000 square miles of ocean (see
<http://www.fijitimes.com/story.aspx?id=80008> and
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_Fiji_floods>).

From Mod.ML's comments in a prior ProMED post, Leptospirosis -
Jamaica 20080125.0312: "Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by one of
the many pathogenic serotypes of the spirochete _Leptospira_. It is
transmitted to humans by exposure of abraded skin or mucous membranes
to water or wet soil (such as after flooding due to heavy rainfall)
that has been contaminated by urine from asymptomatic, chronically
infected animals, especially rodents. Inadequate disposal of trash
and debris can provide a suitable habitat for rat infestation in
urban settings.

The current news release does not characterize the clinical
manifestations or the diagnostic tests that are pending. Because the
clinical manifestations of leptospirosis can overlap those of other
infectious diseases, laboratory confirmation is necessary. As pointed
out by Dr. Jan Clement in the recent ProMED-mail post 20071018.3409,
the serious, potentially life-threatening complications of
leptospirosis that include renal failure, liver disease, and
pneumonia can mimic the clinical manifestations of Seoul hantavirus
(SEOV) infection, which is also transmitted by rats."
