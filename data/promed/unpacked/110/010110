Suspected encephalitis has claimed 38 lives in Bihar's Muzaffarpur district so far this year [2014], and more than 120 children are admitted in various hospitals after being diagnosed with the ailment. The disease has acquired the proportions of an epidemic, and has become an annual affair, with poor children being the most vulnerable among the target groups. No treatment is available so far -- a scary prospect by all standards.

Doctors attending to the patients in the hospital's intensive care still don't know why this disease has been striking Muzaffarpur and adjoining areas for over 2 decades now. So far this year [2014], there have been 38 deaths because of suspected encephalitis. In 2013, there were 62 casualties reported from Muzaffarpur and adjoining districts.

Gorakhpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh [UP], too, has been in the grip of encephalitis. In spite of the best efforts of the government of India and international research organisations, no cause or cure for the disease have been found yet.

Dr Gyan Bhushan, civil surgeon of Muzaffarpur, says, "I have been in the field for 3 years. It seems that heat, and, particularly, humidity have a large role to play. When humidity levels go up, these children seem to develop severe glucose deficiency.''

Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, after chairing a meeting on encephalitis in the capital today [10 Jun 2014], announced a series of measures to tackle the dreaded disease, including a 5-year action plan similar to the pulse polio eradication campaign, a dedicated ward for encephalitis in Muzaffarpur and dedicated surveillance systems to track its outbreak. "I have instructed officials of Bihar and UP to take it up like an emergency. Giving 100 per cent immunisation coverage to a few districts in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh is also a must,'' he told reporters later. [Immunization for what? For Japanese encephalitis virus? Other? - Mod.TY]

[The 9 Jun 2014 edition of the Delhi Daily News (http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/Protests-in-Bihar-as-encephalitis-death-toll-reaches-25-1402308211/) stated that the death toll had risen to 25 children. Now, just 3 days later, the death toll is up to 37 in the Muzaffarpur district. It is curious that the union health minister Harsh Vardhan states that dealing with the outbreak will be handled as an emergency and that a 5-year action plan will be formulated, yet no mention is made of the USA-Indian medical team being put together, led by Jacob John, to determine the etiology (etiologies) of these encephalitis cases. Also, Dr Gyan Bhushan, civil surgeon of Muzaffarpur's comments concerning heat and humidity mentioned above are interesting, given that a published report proposed that heat stroke was responsible for, or contributed to, these cases. Doctors at the Sri Krishna Medical College (SKMC) in Muzaffarpur, which has treated the 2nd highest number of cases in 2013, published 2 articles -- notably the only peer-reviewed medical publications from the area so far -- saying that high temperatures and peak humidity could be leading to heat strokes, which if untreated for long periods may be contributing to the exaggerated symptoms (see ProMED-mail archive no 20130923.1963903).
