Disease sweeps over wheat fields
--------------------------------
Exacerbated by cool and damp weather, a fungal disease called stripe
rust has spread across the Pacific Northwest's croplands, threatening
significant losses in wheat during a growing season that began with
high hopes for above-average yields.

Farmers in Montana and neighboring states have been forced to spend
many thousands of dollars on fungicide to combat what a wheat producer
says is the worst outbreak of stripe rust he's experienced.

Bob Stougaard, Montana State University, wonders if it's a new
strain. Research plants at his nursery that had previously proven
fairly resistant are experiencing "high infection" this year [2011].
He described the rust as "epic."

"I suspect we might have a new race in the area," he said. "If we do,
varieties that were rated as resistant or tolerant may not have that
type of classification and we have to look for new varieties to grow
in this area."

[2] Foot rot - UK

Wheat foot rot takes advantage of dry season
--------------------------------------------
An aggressive fusarium foot rot infection has killed a number of
wheat plants in drought-stressed parts of the eastern counties. The
damage has been caused by the common _Fusarium culmorum_ fungus,
normally associated with ear blight. But because some crops have been
subjected to significant drought stress, the fungus has been able to
take hold, said Bill Clark, Broom's Barn. "It only manifests itself
under very high soil moisture deficits."

The disease is more common in North America, it is particularly rare
for it to appear in UK, he said. "Under normal conditions, the fungus
isn't aggressive enough to kill the plant."

Affected fields have scattered white heads and the symptoms can be
mistaken for ear blight, take-all, or eyespot, said Caroline Nicholls,
HGCA [Home Grown Cereals Authority]. But the stem base appears water
soaked and dark brown, while lower nodes can be pinkish under active
sporulation. There is no effective treatment this [2011] season, but
growers should consider ploughing down trash if infections are severe
to prevent build up of inoculum for next season, she suggested.

[Stripe rust
------------
Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the
fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_. The disease affects
wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses.
It causes yellow leaf stripes and stunting of plants with yield losses
of 40 to 100 percent.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping
season and the fungus survives on living host plants generating a
"green bridge" between seasons. Disease management includes the use of
resistant varieties, fungicide applications, and control of volunteer
crops.

New stripe rust strains with increased virulence are emerging
worldwide. In the US, a new strain was reported for example in 2010
(ProMED-mail post 20100510.1522). Monitoring and resistance breeding
programmes have been established in different wheat growing regions.

Foot rot
--------
Several species of the soil- and residue-borne fungal genus
_Fusarium_ are causing a number of head blight, stalk rot, seedling
root rot, and ear and stalk rot diseases in grain crops such as maize,
wheat, barley, rye, and oats. In parts of northern Europe, _F.
culmorum_ and _F. avenaceum_ are the prevalent pathogens. These fungi
persist and multiply on infected crop residues. Spores are spread by
wind, rain splash, and with contaminated materials. Stress conditions,
such as the drought reported in item 2 above, and lesions caused by
other fungi or insects are known to increase susceptibility of host
plants to _Fusarium_.

_Fusarium_ species, including _F. culmorum_, are capable of producing
mycotoxins which can affect livestock. However, for root infections
causing foot rot as reported above, toxins may be less likely to be
present in the harvested grain. Disease management for _Fusarium_ may
include cultural techniques (such as crop rotation, ploughing in of
contaminated crop residue as mentioned above), crop varieties with
increased levels of resistance, and fungicides for affected above
ground plant parts.
