Heavy rainfall is causing the price of potato to increase steadily.
Heavy rains have damaged the potato crop in Sangli, Satara, and
Kolhapur [Maharashtra state]. The potato crop is also affected
because of late blight disease. "Supply of potato is down by 30
percent," said Vilas Bhujbal, director of the Agriculture Produce
Market Committee.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. The
pathogen can also affect tomato and some other solanaceous crops. It
is spread by plant material (including potato seed tubers), wind and
water. PLB disease management generally relies on fungicide
treatments of seed tubers and crops, but new and more virulent
strains are emerging frequently. For more information on PLB see links below.

While PLB often causes problems in the region of India and its
neighbours, the disease has been extraordinarily rampant this
planting season (2008-2009), with outbreaks reported earlier from
Punjab and West Bengal (previous ProMED-mail posts listed below).
Weather conditions have been partly blamed, but it must be considered
that lack of efficient certification of seed potatoes may be playing
a role in these recent outbreaks as well. Emergence of a new strain
with increased fungicide resistances can also not be excluded.
