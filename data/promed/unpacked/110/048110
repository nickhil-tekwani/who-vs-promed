The outbreak of cholera in Amachi-Igwebuike village of Agba in Ishielu local government area of Ebonyi State has reportedly claimed 3 lives as 12 suspected cases have been recorded.

The Acting Commissioner for Health, Dr. Richard Nnabu, who confirmed the development to newsmen, added that the outbreak has so far been put under control.

Dr. Nnabu, who briefed newsmen immediately after the visit of the state epidemiologist to the area, noted that although 3 deaths and 12 suspected cases were being handled at Agba General Hospital, sensitization and enlightenment have been given to the people of the area on how best to prevent the spread of the disease.

The sensitization on how to prevent cholera includes: keeping the environments clean and hygienic, drinking safe water, and good preservation of food items.

The government of Plateau State, north-central Nigeria, has said not less than 14 people have died of cholera disease within the last 2 months of the outbreak in the state, the News Agency of Nigeria reports.

The state's commissioner for health, Nimkong Lar, who disclosed this on Wednesday [7 Jul 2021] shortly after the cabinet meeting, added that a total number of 953 cases have been recorded within the same period. The report noted that a total of 910 patients have so far been discharged while 29 are still receiving treatment at various health facilities across the state. The commissioner said the disease, which was previously recorded in Jos North local government area [LGA], has spread to 13 LGAs. He said the development requires concerted efforts to address.

The diarrheal disease, which is notorious for killing within hours if not promptly treated, is endemic in Nigeria, with outbreaks reported as far back as the 1970s. Earlier in June [2021], Premium Times had reported that a total of 289 Nigerians have died from the disease between January and June 2021. The report was based on a statement by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). According to the disease center, about 8 states of the federation were then being ravaged by the diarrheal disease.

[Aggressive interventions to stem outbreaks of cholera include providing sources of clean water and a vaccination campaign. The following is extracted from Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J, eds. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp. 113-136:

"For a variety of logistic, financial, and historical reasons, vaccines have not been available for cholera control programs outside of Viet Nam. Given as 2- or 3-dose courses, efficacy can be as high as 60-80% for at least 2-3 years but much shorter protection lengths in children younger than 5 years of age. Cost-effectiveness, especially once an outbreak has occurred, had remained unproven until reports from Guinea (57) and Haiti (58) demonstrated utility.

"The current vaccines prequalified for use by WHO (59) are:
- Dukoral (produced in Sweden) that contains several biotypes of O1 with recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which also offers some protection against enterotoxigenic _E. coli_;
- Shanchol (produced in India) that contains biotypes of both O1 and O139 without the recombinant B unit. In a large study in Kolkata, India, a cluster-randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study of this product (60), the cumulative efficacy of the vaccine at 5 years was 65% (95% CI 52-74, p less than 0.0001). A locally produced vaccine similar to this vaccine (mORCVAX) is produced in Viet Nam;
- Euvichol (produced in South Korea) that, like Shanchol, contains both O1 and O139 without recombinant B subunit. This vaccine has been reported to be non-inferior to Shanchol in a Philippine study (61).

"In June 2016, the US FDA for the 1st time approved a cholera vaccine for use locally in travelers to cholera-endemic areas. This vaccine, Vaxchora, is an oral live, attenuated biologic (62) that is a reformulation of a previous product. This product, a single-dose immunization also referred to as CVD 102-HgR, must be stored in the frozen state and as a live, attenuated bacterial vaccine is not given until at least 14 days after antibacterials were used and should be given at least 10 days before oral chloroquine antimalarial prophylaxis. Single-dose use is an advantage over the older inactivated products, which are given in 2 doses. Studies, however, have suggested that one dose of these inactivated oral vaccines can be effective when the vaccines are in short supply in both endemic and outbreak situations (63, 64)."
