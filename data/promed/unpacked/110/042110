USA finds fever bacteria during war protest weekend
---------------------------------------------------
Small amounts of a bacterium that causes "rabbit fever" were found on
Washington's National Mall last weekend [24-25 Sep 2005], as
thousands of protesters marched against the Iraq War, USA health
authorities said on Sat 1 Oct 2005. The CDC said several government
environmental air monitors in the Mall area detected low levels of
_Francisella tularensis_ bacteria that cause tularemia, commonly
known as rabbit fever, on 24-25 Sep 2005. Public health agencies had
no reports of any related human or animal illnesses caused by the
bacteria.
The CDC said it issued an alert on Friday night, 30 Sep 2005, as a
precaution so medical personnel were aware of the situation and could
report any suspected cases. Tularemia does not transmit from person
to person and can be effectively treated with readily available
medicines, the CDC said. Symptoms usually appear 3 to 5 days after
exposure, but in rare cases can take up to 2 weeks.
Symptoms of the disease include sudden fever, chills, headaches,
conjunctivitis, diarrhea, muscle aches, joint pain, dry cough and
progressive weakness. District of Columbia health officials told
local radio station WTOP on Sat 1 Oct 2005 that the detected bacteria
was not harmful and probably occurred naturally.
The CDC waited a week to notify city officials of the detected
bacteria because it took that long to test the samples at labs and
confirm its presence, the radio station reported.
According to the CDC's website, people can get tularemia by being
bitten by a infected tick, deerfly or other insect, handling infected
animal carcasses, eating or drinking contaminated food or water or
breathing in the organisms. The CDC also said the bacterium can be
used as a weapon if made into an aerosol that could be inhaled.

[Although not many human cases are reported in the USA each year and the
disease is primarily endemic in the middle USA, as well as Martha's Vineyard,
an island off the coast of Massachusetts, almost every state has reported
cases -- see refs. below. Since the bacterium is ubiquitous, unlike plague,
the BioWatch system may detect its nucleic acid if, for instance, material
containing the organism is aerosolized by landscaping or yard work.
A description of the BioWatch system can be obtained from the Federation of
American Scientists website at:

Test Results Cited in Delay of Mall Alert; CDC Explains Why Local
Officials Weren't Told for Days About Bacterium Detection
-----------------------------------------------
Area health officials were not notified for 5 days that sensors on
the [Washington DC] Mall had detected a potentially dangerous
bacterium there last month [September 2005], because subsequent tests
were not conclusively positive, a federal official said yesterday [4
Oct 2005].
The Department of Homeland Security delayed in alerting the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] for the same reason,
said Richard Besser, who directs the CDC's coordinating office for
terrorism preparedness and emergency response. More than half a dozen
sensors showed the presence of tularemia bacteria the morning, after
thousands of people gathered on the Mall for a book festival and
antiwar rally, yet the CDC was not contacted for at least 72 hours.
Testing never identified all the definitive markers for which
scientists were looking, and officials were wary of issuing a false
alarm, Besser said. He called the entire incident "highly unusual,"
but he acknowledged that it would prompt the 2 agencies to review
their protocol and the timeliness of their response "to make sure the
system doesn't have any flaws in it. It really will cause us to look
at the system and say, 'Should things have been different?'" Besser
said in a phone interview.
In letters Representative Thomas M. Davis III (Virginia Republican)
sent on Monday [3 Sep 2005] to Homeland Security Secretary Michael
Chertoff and CDC Director Julie Gerberding, he called the
notification time frame "alarming" and asked for an accounting of the
procedures triggered when the government's "BioWatch network" senses
a biological agent. His questions focused on what each agency knew
and when it knew it, as well as which local and state officials were
called and when. "Why weren't these officials notified immediately
following the detection?" Davis wrote. [Probably because it was
initially thought to be a false alarm, and the agency did not want to
cause unnecessary panic. - Mod.JW]
D.C. Health Director Gregg A. Pane, who learned of the situation in a
conference call on Friday [30 Sep 2005] morning, said he would have
liked to have been involved sooner. Hours after being alerted by the
CDC, he and his counterparts across the Washington region put out an
announcement for the public. "I wish they'd bring us in earlier," he
said yesterday [4 Oct 2005]. "There's got to be a level of trust and
communication" among the entities and layers of government, he said.
As of yesterday [4 Oct 2005], local and federal health officials said
they had confirmed no cases of tularemia from the Mall gathering and,
through medical surveillance, had not found any spikes in possible
symptoms. Although the germ that causes tularemia is highly
infectious, the disease itself is not passed from person to person
and can be easily treated with antibiotics. Left untreated, it can be
fatal.
Besser said that if the initial evaluation had revealed true
positives, the laboratory would have immediately contacted Homeland
Security, which would have immediately brought CDC and local health
agencies into the discussion.
Instead, as late as Thursday [29 Sep 2005], CDC officials expected
final testing to disprove the presence of the bacteria. "So we didn't
really think there was a need to alert [area] public health
officials," he said.
In his letter, Davis requested specifics about the bacteria levels
ultimately detected and the government's plan to inform the public of
risk. "How do you monitor the thousands of people who visited the
affected areas?" he asked.
A Homeland Security spokeswoman did not return calls to comment on
the issues Davis raised.

[ProMED thanks all the readers who sent in versions of this report.
Analysts were correct to suspect a false positive, since the
background of tularemia in the DC area is very low -- no human cases
reported since 2000 -- and the rarer an organism in the area, the
higher the probability of a false positive.
A similar incident occurred in Houston (TX), USA in October 2003, when 2 air
sensors detected fragments of tularemia bacteria. There were no human cases of
tularemia reported after the incident, and some experts in the bioterror field
said they believe the incident was actually spurred by a strain of the
bacterium that does not affect humans (Source: Petula Dvorak, Washington Post
2 Oct 2005) -- see ref. below.
However, it appears from the above report that confirmatory tests were
positive, although the levels detected were rather low to be considered a
threat. It is important to know eventually whether the bacterium was type A or
B or a vaccine strain. - Mod.JW]
