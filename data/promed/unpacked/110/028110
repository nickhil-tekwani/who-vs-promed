Novel Coronavirus - China, Update 12 Jan 2020
----------------------------
On [11 and 12 Jan 2020], WHO received further detailed information from the National Health Commission about the outbreak.

WHO is reassured of the quality of the ongoing investigations and the response measures implemented in Wuhan and the commitment to share information regularly.

The evidence is highly suggestive that the outbreak is associated with exposures in one seafood market in Wuhan. The market was closed on [1 Jan 2020]. At this stage, there is no infection among healthcare workers, and no clear evidence of human to human transmission. The Chinese authorities continue their work of intensive surveillance and follow up measures, as well as further epidemiological investigations.

Among the 41 confirmed cases, there has been one death. This death occurred in a patient with serious underlying medical conditions.

China shared the genetic sequence of the novel coronavirus on [12 Jan 2020], which will be of great importance for other countries to use in developing specific diagnostic kits.

The cluster was initially reported on [31 Dec 2019], when the WHO China Country Office was informed. The Chinese authorities identified a new type of coronavirus (novel coronavirus, nCoV), which was isolated on [7 Jan 2020]. Laboratory testing was conducted on all suspected cases identified through active case finding and retrospective review. Other respiratory pathogens such as influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were ruled out as the cause.

According to information conveyed to WHO by Chinese authorities on [11 and 12 Jan 2020], 41 cases with novel coronavirus infection have been preliminarily diagnosed in Wuhan City. Of the 41 cases reported, 7 are severely ill. This is when the one death, mentioned above, was reported in a patient with other underlying health conditions. Six patients have been discharged from hospital. Symptom onset of the 41 confirmed nCoV cases ranges from [8 Dec 2019] to [2 Jan 2020]. No additional cases have been detected since [3 Jan 2020].

The clinical signs and symptoms reported are mainly fever, with a few cases having difficulty in breathing, and chest radiographs showing invasive pneumonic infiltrates in both lungs. National authorities report that patients have been isolated and are receiving treatment in Wuhan medical institutions.

According to the preliminary epidemiological investigation, most cases worked at or were handlers and frequent visitors to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market. The government reports that there is no clear evidence that the virus passes easily from person to person.

Currently, no case with infection of this novel coronavirus has been reported elsewhere other than Wuhan.

China's National Health Commission has deployed a group of experts to Wuhan City to support the local response.

National authorities have reported the following response measures:

- A total of 763 close contacts including healthcare workers, have been identified and followed up, and no additional cases of infection with the novel coronavirus have been identified;
- The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission carried out active case finding, and retrospective investigations of the current cluster of patients have been completed;
- The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market has been temporarily closed to carry out environmental sanitation and disinfection;
- Public risk communication activities have been carried out to improve public awareness and adoption of self-protection measures;
- WHO is closely monitoring the situation and is in regular contact with national authorities in China to provide support required. Technical guidance on novel coronavirus has been developed and will continue to be updated as additional information becomes available.

WHO risk assessment:
To date, investigations are still underway to assess the full extent of the outbreak.

Wuhan city is a major domestic and international transport hub. To date, there have been no reported cases outside of Wuhan City.

More comprehensive information and ongoing investigations are also required to better understand the epidemiology, clinical picture, source, modes of transmission, and extent of infection, as well as the countermeasures implemented.

WHO advice
Based on information provided by national authorities, WHO's recommendations on public health measures and surveillance for novel coronaviruses apply.

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers. In case of symptoms suggestive of respiratory illness either during or after travel, travellers are encouraged to seek medical attention and share travel history with their healthcare provider. Travel guidance has been updated.

WHO advises against the application of any travel or trade restrictions on China based on the information currently available on this event.

[Given the WHO decision to refer to this outbreak by the identified novel coronavirus, we will be changing the thread name of the reports to reflect this: "Novel coronavirus - China: (Hubei).

In summary, there are currently 41 individuals confirmed as part of the Wuhan CoV outbreak including one fatality with an individual with serious pre-existing co-morbidities. There are 7 individuals in serious condition. Six individuals have been discharged from the hospital. Dates of onset of the cases ranged from [8 Dec 2019] to [2 Jan 2020], with no additional cases detected since [3 Jan 2020]. 763 individuals with identified close contact with the cases are under observation (including medical staff); no secondary cases have been identified.

It is too early to breathe a collective sigh of relief, as tempting as it may be. There are other wet markets in China that may have animals from the same area. We still do not know the host or possible intermediary host of this virus. And with the coming Chinese New Year (25 Jan 2020), there will be massive population movement in the country and the region, and wildlife meals are delicacies...

[2] More on identified coronavirus
Date: Sun 12 Jan 2020

The new virus behind the pneumonia outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan has a genetic makeup largely similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, said a leading infectious disease expert in the city.

The University of Hong Kong's Professor Yuen Kwok Yung on Saturday [11 Jan 2020] said the genetic sequence of the new coronavirus was "80 per cent similar" to the SARS virus found in bats, civets and humans.

Speaking at a briefing, he said the difference between the 2 lies in the part of the virus that determines whether it could "enter animal cells."

"The genetic sequence of the virus could change, and that would completely change its toxicity and infectiousness," Prof. Yuen said, adding that the genetic sequence of the SARS virus changed in 2003 and thus was able to spread among humans.

That said, the microbiologist cautioned that there was not enough information to determine whether the new infection would turn into an epidemic, reminiscent of the SARS outbreak.

The SARS epidemic originated in China, infected more than 1700 people in Hong Kong, and killed nearly 300. More than 800 people, including 33 in Singapore, died from SARS in 2002 and 2003.

Prof. Yuen warned that Hong Kong must continue to stay vigilant and that the tests now used by health authorities in the city were effective in screening suspected patients.

Meanwhile, the Hong Kong Hospital Authority on Saturday [11 Jan 2020] reported a total of 60 suspected cases of the Wuhan virus since [31 Dec 2019]. All the patients had made trips to Wuhan but not to the seafood wholesale market in the city where most of the confirmed cases originated. More than 2/3rds of the suspected cases in Hong Kong, or 46 patients, have been discharged, and the remainder are in stable condition.

Hong Kong authorities have in recent days stepped up vigilance and public health surveillance, with the government making it mandatory to alert officials of any suspected cases. "At the moment, everybody in Hong Kong, including the general public, the healthcare workers, and other stakeholders have to remain vigilant and don't take the new disease lightly, because we have the painful experience of SARS. So, we have to take every measure and closely monitor the situation," the Controller of the Centre for Health Protection Wong Ka Hei said at the briefing on Saturday [11 Jan 2020].

In Singapore, the Ministry of Health said on Saturday [11 Jan 2020] that a 2nd suspected case -- a 26-year-old China national with pneumonia and travel history to Wuhan -- was found not to be linked to the pneumonia cluster in Wuhan. The case has also tested negative for coronavirus.

Last week, a 3-year-old girl, also with a travel history to Wuhan, was kept in isolation until it was proven that she was not infected by the new virus.

[It is not surprising that the suspected cases of pneumonia identified in Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok have tested negative for the coronavirus as none of the patients gave a history of contact with the implicated Seafood Market, and the outbreak at present seems to have been contained to individuals with contact in the Seafood Market.

With respect to the phylogenetic anlayses, EcoHealth Alliance posted findings of preliminary phylogenetic analysis of the genome of the Wuhan CoV (the phylogenetic tree is available at https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/2020/01/phylogenetic-analysis-shows-novel-wuhan-coronavirus-clusters-with-sars). According to EcoHealth Alliance: "The coronavirus genome was released by the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center & School of Public Health, in collaboration with the Central Hospital of Wuhan, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute for Communicable Disease Control and Prevention, Chinese Center for Disease Control, and the University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. It can be accessed and downloaded at http://virological.org/t/initial-genome-release-of-novel-coronavirus/319.

Twitter discussions have raised the observation that it appears as though this outbreak was associated with a single spillover from the animal hosts due to non-divergence of the genomes (https://twitter.com/arambaut/status/1216026183118344196). - Mod.MPP]
