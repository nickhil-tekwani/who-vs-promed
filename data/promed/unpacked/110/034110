A warning has been issued after an increase in cases of the fungal infection sporotrichosis, also known as rose gardener's disease or mouldy hay disease, in the South West during recent months. There have been 11 cases diagnosed in the region, mostly in the Margaret River area, according to WA Country Health Service South West Population Health Unit.

The fungus lives throughout the world in soil, plants, and decaying vegetation, and outbreaks have been documented in the United States and Brazil, as well as in WA. This is the 4th outbreak in WA, following previous ones in 2000-2001, 2004-05 and 2012-2013.

WACHS South West Public Health Physician Dr Naru Pal said sporotrichosis is caused by a fungus called _Sporothrix schenckii_, which most commonly affects the skin and/or subcutaneous tissues. "Infections are usually associated with minor skin trauma like cuts and scratches, usually after the patient has handled contaminated hay. In very rare situations it can cause lung infection," he said.

"The 1st symptom is usually a small painless lump resembling an insect bite at the site where the fungus enters the skin, usually on the finger, hand, arm or leg - this usually occurs about 1 to 12 weeks after exposure to the fungus."

"The nodule eventually increases in size and may look like an open sore or ulcer that is very slow to heal. Additional nodules usually appear and these may seem to track up the affected limb."

Sporotrichosis is not spread from person to person, but a small number of human cases overseas have been caused by scratches or bites from small domestic animals carrying the infection on their claws. The majority of patients in the South West were gardeners who had contact with hay or straw mulch, or who worked with straw products.

The community is advised to wear protective clothing like gloves and long sleeves when handling straw mulch, bales of hay, thorny plants or other materials that can cause skin breaks to reduce risk of contracting the infection. A mask can be also worn to reduce the risk of inhaling fungal spores. The infection requires 3 to 6 months of specific anti-fungal medication, and treatment can be protracted and expensive. There is no vaccine to prevent sporotrichosis.

The WACHS South West Population Health Unit has distributed fact sheets and information to local straw suppliers and informed local GPs and the Environmental Health Directorate.

[The following information regarding sporotrichosis is from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/sporotrichosis/:

"Sporotrichosis is an infection caused by a fungus called _Sporothrix schenckii_. The fungus lives throughout the world in soil, plants, and decaying vegetation. Cutaneous (skin) infection is the most common form of infection, although pulmonary infection can occur if a person inhales the microscopic, airborne fungal spores. Most cases of sporotrichosis are sporadic and are associated with minor skin trauma like cuts and scrapes; however, outbreaks have been linked to activities that involve handling contaminated vegetation such as moss, hay, or wood.

"The 1st symptom is usually a small painless nodule (bump) resembling an insect bite. The 1st nodule may appear any time from 1-12 weeks after exposure to the fungus. The nodule can be red, pink, or purple in color, and it usually appears on the finger, hand, or arm where the fungus has entered through a break in the skin. The nodule will eventually become larger and may look like an open sore or ulcer that is very slow to heal. Additional bumps or nodules may appear later near the original lesion. Most sporothrix infections only involve the skin. However, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, including the bones, joints, and the central nervous system. Usually, these types of disseminated infections only occur in people with weakened immune systems. In rare cases, a pneumonia-like illness can occur after inhaling sporothrix spores, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and fever.

"Most cases of sporotrichosis only involve the skin and/or subcutaneous tissues and are non-life-threatening, but the infection requires treatment with prescription antifungal medication for several months. The most common treatment for this type of sporotrichosis is oral itraconazole for 3 to 6 months. Itraconazole may also be used to treat bone and joint infections, but treatment should continue for at least 12 months. For patients with severe disease, and/or an infection that has spread throughout the body, a lipid formulation of amphotericin B should be used. Itraconazole can be used for step-down therapy once the patient has stabilized. Supersaturated potassium iodide (SSKI) is another treatment option for cutaneous or lymphocutaneous disease. SSKI and azole drugs like itraconazole should not be used during pregnancy. Treatment recommendations may differ for children."
