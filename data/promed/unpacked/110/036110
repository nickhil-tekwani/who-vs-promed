The Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory, Wyoming Department of Health, and Wyoming Livestock Board have received reports of "significant" West Nile virus (WNV) activity in the state over the past 2 weeks, they announced on [Mon 10 Sep 2018].

In addition to one human case being confirmed in Fremont County, official reported 7 cases of WNV in Wyoming horses residing in Campbell, Fremont, Goshen, Park, and Sheridan counties. They've also found WNV in a golden eagle, a crow, and a hawk, as well as in mosquito pools in Fremont, Goshen, Hot Springs, and Natrona counties.

West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit

- Flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
- Fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (twitching);
- Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
- Changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it";
- Occasional drowsiness;
- Propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control);
- Spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
- Asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia (incoordination).

WNV has no cure, but some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40 percent.

Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV-prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3-6-week period. Full immunity takes several weeks to achieve.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by

- Removing stagnant water sources;
- Dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
- Keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
- Applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

The Kansas Department of Agriculture Division of Animal Health says West Nile virus (WNV) has been confirmed in horses across the state over the past few weeks. The confirmed cases have been reported in Lyon, Seward, Neosho, Marion, and Wichita counties. Officials say the confirmed cases in Kansas were in unvaccinated horses or horses with an unknown vaccination history so were assumed to be unvaccinated.

Horses infected with West Nile virus can have signs ranging from depression, loss of appetite, and fever to severe neurologic signs such as incoordination, weakness, inability to rise, and hypersensitivity to touch or sound.

Horse owners should consult with their local veterinarians and make a vaccination plan for their horses. If you see signs of WNV in your horse, contact your veterinarian immediately.

[Some places are getting late-summer/early-autumn rains, which promote the mosquito population.

While immunity may take about 2 weeks for development, it is still advisable to vaccinate your horses. Practicing good mosquito control is always a must. Eliminate standing water, such as in old tires, the saucers for potted plants, and other little places of standing water where mosquitoes can breed. Use equine-safe horse sprays, and use them as recommended on your animal. Use barn sprays according to regulations. Help your horse resist this disease. - Mod.TG
