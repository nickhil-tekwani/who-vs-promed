For Viet Nam, the impact of _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_ (Foc) is estimated as loss in banana production area of up to 71% within the next 25 years. The rise of the TR4 strain has resulted in worldwide anxiety. However, _F. oxysporum_ is a species complex (FOSC) that is yet to be fully disentangled. Identification of individual species causing fungal banana wilt is needed to develop concrete measures for controlling the spread of the disease. Using DNA analyses and morphological characterisation, an international team of scientists has investigated the population diversity of fusarium-associated banana wilt in northern Viet Nam.

The study shows that approximately 3 out of 4 fusarium infections of bananas in that area are caused by the species _F. tardichlamydosporum_, which was previously Race 1 of the FOSC. Foc TR4, now _F. odoratissimum_ in the FOSC, is not yet a dominant strain in northern Viet Nam and only accounts for 10% of the infections. A similar proportion is caused by the species _F. cugenangense_, previously Race 2 of the FOSC. Fusarium wilt was not only found in cultivated bananas but also in wild bananas, indicating that wild bananas might be a reservoir for fusarium pathogens to reinfect crops.

[Based on molecular data, various strains and pathovars of _Fusarium oxysporum_ have recently been reclassified as members of a species complex (FOSC; see link below), as explained in the report above. Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soil-borne fungus previously referred to as _Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem; affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including human and insect activities), soil, and water.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. The fungus can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently, crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available. Integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED post 20090419.1483), which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents such as _Trichoderma_ species (for example, ProMED post 20160317.4102576 and see link below). Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance or tolerance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

The pathogens within the species complex vary in host range. Cavendish banana varieties (_Musa_ AAA, see links below) replaced the original eating varieties (such as Gros Michel) because they are resistant to the original fungal strain. They include most of the current commercial eating bananas. Cavendish-affecting strains, such as temperate (subtropical) and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 (ProMED post 20101223.4510), have emerged since but appeared to be limited to Asia and Oceania. But in recent years, Tropical Race 4 (TR4) has also been reported outside that area in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (see previous ProMED posts in the archives). TR4 is of great concern worldwide. TR4 was reported from Viet Nam for the first time in 2017 (ProMED post 20171108.5432554).

The source publication above states further that one of the isolates cultured from symptomatic banana plants was phylogenetically not positioned within the FOSC, but fell within the _F. fujikuroi_ species complex. Thus, it may represent a possible new pathogen of bananas. (For more information on the _F. fujikuroi_ complex refer to ProMed post 20210825.8620058 and earlier items in the archives.)
