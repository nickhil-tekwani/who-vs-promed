Disease devastates cassava crop, threatens widespread hunger
------------------------------------------------------------
Cassava is the staple food for most people in the Republic of Congo,
but this main source of nourishment is being threatened by a disease
that has spread to most areas of the country. "We've been having
problems for more than 2 years and the mosaic is destroying our
crops," said Rose Ambeto, who has several cassava fields. "Our
harvests are getting worse and worse," she said. Veronique Okaka, who
grows cassava in Sangha department [northern Congo], also complained
of hard times due to the cassava mosaic. The price of cassava has
more than doubled in recent months.

Specialists in Congo's agricultural ministry say the disease might
lead to a drop of between 60 and 90 percent in harvests and could
throw entire communities into a critical food situation. CMD [cassava
mosaic disease] has been spreading throughout central Africa and
arrived in the Republic of Congo in the mid-1990s. In October [2008],
the International Committee of the Red Cross joined the Congolese Red
Cross and the agriculture ministry to provide training on ways of
fighting the disease.

The departments of Pool and Plateaux [southeastern Congo], also badly
hit by the epidemic, recently received more than 330 000 cuttings of
6 different CMD-resistant varieties of cassava developed by the
International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Another 175
000 cuttings from 4 new resistant strains are being distributed in 4
other departments.

[Cassava is a major factor in food security across sub-Saharan Africa
with an annual consumption of around 80 kg (176.4 lb) per person. In
the past, production has been severely affected by cassava mosaic
disease (CMD), which triggered a food crisis by destroying harvests
throughout the region. CMD is caused by several virus species and
strains in the genus _Begomovirus_. Recently one of them, _African
Cassava Mosaic Virus_ (ACMV), has been found for the 1st time in
soybeans with leaf mosaic suggesting that these begomoviruses may
pose a threat to other crops as well. For more information on CMD and
associated viruses see ProMED-mail post no. 20081009.3197 and links
listed below.

Control of CMD via its whitefly vectors and reservoir plants has
proven unsatisfactory under conditions in developing countries, and
the use of resistant crop cultivars appears to be the best way to
control the disease. FAO (UN Food and Agriculture Organisation) in
collaboration with various partners (such as IITA) has supported
development and distribution of CMD-resistant varieties. This has
alleviated the problem in some of the affected countries including
the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, however, the
Republic of the Congo still appears to be severely affected by CMD.
