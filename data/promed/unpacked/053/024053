Acting President and Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn on Friday [23 Dec 2016] called on quarantine officials to strive harder to plug any loophole in their operations to contain avian influenza (AI) that has devastated chicken farms across the country since last month [November 2016].

"If we fail to pay attention to just 1 or 2 (farms), a loophole will emerge, and AI will further spread. Thus, we need strong, thorough quarantine measures," he added.

The acting president, in particular, stressed the need to strengthen disinfection measures for egg farms across the country, which have been cited as one of the causes for the continued spread of AI.

Hwang also ordered central and provincial governments to beef up their coordination in carrying out quarantine measures.

Last week, a new type of AI was discovered, which put quarantine officials on higher alert.

The H5N8 strain of the bird flu was detected at a chicken farm located in Anseong [Gyeonggi province], some 77 km [about 48 miles] south of Seoul. The country has also suffered from the spread of the H5N6 strain, which is seen as more pathogenic than the H5N8 type.

To prevent additional AI outbreaks, authorities have culled some 22 million chickens since the 1st outbreak was recorded on 16 Nov 2016.

[This posting has been communicated by an EpiCore Surveillance Project member, who is gratefully acknowledged, in response to ProMED-mail's request for information. The report confirms earlier information on the recurrence of HPAI H5N8 in South Korea (see 20161222.4716700). South Korea is currently experiencing a H5N6 outbreak, and this is the 1st time the 2 strains have appeared in the country concurrently.

While HPAI H5N6 is known to have caused human cases in several countries, no such case has, so far, reported as caused by HPAI H5N8.

HPAI H5N8 has spread, during the recent months, from central Asia with bird migration into southern Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North and West Africa. Its recurrence in South Korea sounds an alarm to Eastern Asia at large, including Japan.

According to recent information, the spread continues in Europe as well. In France, where so far only south-western regions were affected, there is new information on 2 whistling ducks found infected in the Manche Department, Normandy (see http://www.normandie-actu.fr/grippe-aviaire-premier-cas-virus-h5n8-identifie-normandie_248322/). In the UK, where infected wild birds were detected in Wales, there are cases in wild birds in England (see separate posting). - Mod.AS
