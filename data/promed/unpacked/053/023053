Outbreak of Trichinella in Poland
-----------------------------
The outbreak is from wild boars. There were many wild boars shot, but
probably not all were examined by veterinary services. [Such numbers are
probably known only to] hunters and their families, and it is indeed very
difficult to estimate how many animals were killed. Some animals shot were
under the 20 kg minimum in force during the hunting season, so the hunters
don't want to report them.
The number of number of people who so far have had contact with infected
meat is at least 124, and we have hospitalised the 11th patient. The
previous outbreak in West Poland was in July/August 2002, but the number of
patients was not more than 70.
The current outbreak involves an equal mixture of domestic and wild pigs;
both butchers involved had veterinary certificates for meat examination.
Probably a small wild animal of about 30 kg was added during meat
preparation. Such weight indicates an error in calculations of the total
weight of meat used, so this may indicate, for example, the addition of a
nutria or other animal that had no certificate of veterinary analysis for
Trichinella.
Domestic pigs and horses are quite safe in Poland. Trichinella infection is
not a problem in horses in Poland at present.

[Wild boar is a well-known source of Trichinella. Apparently the
legislation introduced to ensure that meat is inspected is not respected;
furthermore, such meat finds it way into food that is declared to be pure
pork. - Mod.EP]
