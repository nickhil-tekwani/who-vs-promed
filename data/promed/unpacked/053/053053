[1] Horsemeat scandal, Europe

A scandal over horsemeat found in frozen beef products is spiraling across Europe as several governments launch investigations and a company involved says it has determined who "the villain" is.

Police probes and legal maneuvers responding to the discovery are quickly becoming a tangled web, much like the complex supply chain of the meat products themselves.

Swedish food producer Findus has been a focus of the uproar since it announced Thursday [7 Feb 2013] that it had withdrawn its lasagna from UK stores as a precaution. The products were pulled after French supplier Comigel raised concerns about the type of meat that was used, Findus Sweden said.

But Findus is only one of several companies that receives products from Comigel. Others include Axfood, Coop, and ICA, all of which announced they have pulled certain meat products from the shelves due to the possibility they contain horsemeat.

Findus Nordic -- which oversees the company throughout the Nordic region -- said it has begun legal action against Comigel and its sub-suppliers.

Findus's French arm, meanwhile, said it will file a legal complaint Monday [11 Feb 2013] against a Romanian business that is part of the supply chain. It did not name the business publicly, and French government officials say their investigation will include a look at parts of the supply chain in some other countries.

France's consumer affairs minister, Benoit Hamon, has ordered an immediate investigation, and results will be available by midweek. In a statement, Hamon said a provider in Luxembourg and traders in Cyprus and the Netherlands are also part of the chain being probed.

The scandal comes just weeks after a discovery that shocked many and triggered a crisis in Europe's meat industry. Last month [January 2013], horsemeat was found in hamburgers sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Officials in Ireland have blamed Polish meat ingredients.

In January 2013, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland found that 10 out of 27 hamburger products it analyzed in a study contained horse DNA, while 23 of them -- or 85 per cent -- tested positive for pig DNA.

In 9 out of the 10 burger samples, the horse DNA was found at very low levels, the inspectors said, but in one sample from Tesco, Britain's largest retailer, the horse meat accounted for about 29 per cent of the burger. Tesco apologized to customers after the revelation and promised action to make sure it never happened again.

Prime minister David Cameron said on Friday [8 Feb 2013] on Twitter. "This is completely unacceptable; this isn't about food safety but about proper food labeling and confidence in retailers," he wrote.

The revelations have revolted many meat eaters in the United Kingdom, where horsemeat is generally considered taboo, although it is commonly eaten in neighboring France as well as countries including China, Russia, Kazakhstan, and Italy.

While horsemeat is not itself a food safety hazard, its unauthorized presence -- in quantities up to 100 per cent in foods purported to be made with beef -- has raised serious concerns.

Chief among food inspectors' concerns is that the illicit horsemeat could contain the veterinary drug phenylbutazone, or "bute", commonly used to treat horses. Meat from animals treated with phenylbutazone is not allowed to enter the food chain as it may pose a risk to human health. [see item 2].

The discovery of pig DNA in beef products is of particular concern to Jews and Muslims, whose dietary laws forbid the consumption of pork products. Jewish dietary laws also ban the eating of horsemeat.

The UK Justice Ministry confirmed last week that a number of meat pies and similar items supplied to prisons in England and Wales were labeled and served as halal -- prepared in compliance with Islamic dietary law -- but contained traces of pork DNA, the Food Standards Agency said.

Horsemeat is not commonly eaten in the United States, but the country does export it to Canada and Mexico. Congress passed a bill in November 2011 that lifted a 5 year old ban on the slaughter of horses for meat in the United States.

Commenting on further reports that horsemeat has entered the food chain and is being sold as beef, Peter Jones, president of the British Veterinary Association, said:

"These incidents are understandably causing concern about the integrity of the food chain, and so it is vital that the FSA and DEFRA [Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs] carry out their investigations as quickly as possible. Consumers must be able to have confidence in the provenance of their food.

"We are pleased to see that the testing of beef products has been stepped up and that DEFRA has announced that all horses slaughtered for human consumption will be sampled for the presence of phenylbutazone (bute). Phenylbutazone is a painkiller and anti-inflammatory that is traditionally used in horses. A maximum residue limit (MRL) in meat has not been established for the use of phenylbutazone in food-producing animals because of concerns regarding the toxicity of the drug and its metabolites, which can be harmful to human health over a lifetime exposure.

"A horse passport system was introduced because of a shortage of licensed medicines for horses considered safe for human consumption. When a medicine that does not have an MRL established (such as bute) is administered to a horse, the veterinary surgeon will sign the horse out of the food chain at the time of treatment. This enables the use of such medicines whilst preventing the horse from entering the food chain. However, if there is evidence of illegal activity in which unregulated horsemeat of unknown provenance is entering the food chain, then, of course, there will be an increased risk of phenylbutazone entering the food chain, as it is a commonly used drug in horses."

"The DEFRA chief veterinary officer has reminded veterinary surgeons of their legal obligations under the Horse Passports Regulations 2009."

The British Equine Veterinary Association (a division of the BVA) gives the following information:

When prescribing phenylbutazone or suxibuzone, vets must ensure that part II of section IX of the horse passport is signed to exclude the horse from the food chain. If the passport is not available, it may be preferable to use an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) where maximum residue limits are known. Alternatively, in an emergency situation, veterinary surgeons should use the following form, "Equine requiring emergency treatment in the absence of a passport," to ensure that owners understand their responsibilities. A copy of this instruction, signed by the owners, should be kept. Vets are advised to keep blank copies of this form handy.

Due to recent publicity surrounding this issue, all carcasses are now being tested for phenylbutazone residues. Defra and the FSA have indicated a desire to prosecute individuals who ignore the Horse Passport regulations.

[3] UK food recall
Date: Fri 8 Feb 2013
Source: Food Safety Agency (FSA) [edited]
http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2013/feb/investigation-statement


The FSA has, this morning [8 Feb 2013], issued a further statement about the horse meat issue:

"This is a very serious issue. The evidence we have about the 2 cases, of the significant amount of horse meat in burgers and lasagne, points to either gross negligence or deliberate contamination in the food chain. This is why we have already involved the police, both here and in Europe.

"We believe that these 2 particular cases -- the frozen burgers from Tesco and the lasagne from Findus -- are linked to suppliers in Ireland and France, respectively. We are working closely with the authorities in these countries to get to the root of the problem. Our priority remains to protect UK consumers. People have been asking whether it is safe to eat any frozen meat products at the moment. There is no reason to suspect that there's any health issue with frozen food in general, and we wouldn't advise people to stop eating it.

"In the particular cases of the Findus lasagne and the Tesco burgers, they have been withdrawn from sale. Anyone who has them in their freezer should return them to retailers as a precaution. In addition to the widespread testing we are doing, we've instructed the industry to urgently carry out its own tests on processed beef products to see whether horsemeat is present."

[Details on food recalls in the UK and Ireland related to horsemeat in beef products are available in the European section at http://efoodalert.net/2013/02/08/recalls-and-alerts-february-8-2013/.

According to UK's DEFRA and Food Standards Agency, the number of horses being slaughtered for human consumption has almost doubled over the last 3 years and represents about one per cent of the UK horse population. "Therefore, vets must not ignore the significant number of horses that do enter the food chain each year." They stressed that the Equine Passport and VMD Regulations exist to protect public health and ensure that veterinary medication continues to be available (see http://www.beva.org.uk/news-and-events/news/view/359).

DEFRA and the VMD, alongside BEVA, have developed guidelines and leaflets which describe the requirements for veterinary surgeons and horse keepers regarding administration of medicines to horses. Copies of the Guidance Notes are available at http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/pdf/vmgn/VMGNote16.pdf and copies of the leaflet at http://www.vmd.defra.gov.uk/pdf/leaflet_horses.pdf. - Mod.AS

The statement by the British Veterinary Association does not address some pertinent issues. Firstly, has phenylbutazone been found in the meat in question? Secondly, when preparing the drug (phenylbutazone) for licensure and use, the drug manufacturer(s) would have had to do meat testing. Often, liver, kidney (organ meats) and at least one muscle meat are tested prior to licensure of a drug. Consequently, what are the legally agreed upon levels in the meat and the organ tissues? [The BVA's statement, above, say "A maximum residue limit (MRL) in meat has not been established", indicating that the presence of any phenylbutazone residue would constitute an infringement. - Mod.SH] There is a recall issue on the meat now, so presumably, it has been tested, and some residue has been found there. While horse meat may be unappetizing to some, it is not dangerous, but the drugs in the meat may be. As a recall is never cheap and can have devastating consequences to a company and to the food safety confidence of the consumer, then it seems likely that prohibited substances have been detected in the meat. The question remains: what are the substances, and at what level are they present? - Mod.TG]
