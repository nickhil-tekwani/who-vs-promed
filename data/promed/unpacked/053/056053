Presentation of the Danish delegation on the actions taken in Denmark
in relation with the detection of CSF in Lithuania
------------------------------------------
[According to the Danish presentation (7 slides), the event started on
30 Jun 2009, when the Danish National Veterinary Laboratory informed
DFVA (Danish Veterinary and Food Administration) on the finding of CSF
in samples submitted from a Danish owned pig holding in Lithuania.
Reportedly, the Danish CVO contacted immediately the Lithuanian
veterinary authorities. Two Danish contact farms which had delivered
the pigs to Lithuania on 17 Feb 2009 were placed under official
restrictions, and investigations were initiated. Subscribers can refer
to the above URL for details of the extensive investigations,
including laboratory tests, carried out in Denmark before and after
the event in Lithuania. - Mod.AS]

Conclusions:
1. No clinical signs of disease in the 2 Danish contact farms
2. No indication of CSF in 2009 in both farms based on laboratory tests
3. No pre-history of abnormal disease problems in 2009 in both farms
4. No wild boars in Denmark
5. The 2 Danish pig farms have no direct connection to the CSF
outbreak in Lithuania.

CSF in Lithuania - presentation by the State Food and Veterinary
Service [SFVS] of the Republic of Lithuania
----------------------------
a. Infected farm data
---------------------
Herd originated from 2 Danish SPF herds:
- Danish landrace
- Duroc
445 pigs: 415 sows and 30 boars. Age 7-9 months
High biosecurity farm (SPF conditions).

The farm is one of the 8 farms, owned by the Danish company SAERIMNER
[a map, indicating the 8 locations, is provided].
Total 226 330 pigs in all 8 farms.

The farm had been fully depopulated half a year before. On 17 Feb
2009, 445 pigs from 2 Danish SPF herds were brought. No movement, no
trade of pigs from/to the suspected farm carried out since 17 Feb 2009.

b. Chronology
-------------
1. Since the beginning of June 2009, increased mortality (25 percent
in total).
Clinical signs:
- CNS symptoms (ataxia for 2 days);
- Unable to take feed and water;
- Temperature 40-40.5 C.

No typical CSF clinical signs were observed. All the pigs were treated
on the farm. Samples for testing were taken and brought to Denmark for
investigation on 4 Jun 2009 and on 19 Jun 2009.
No information was provided to the local SFVS about the above disease,
the treatment of the animals, and the sampling.

2. 25 Jun 2009 (about 1:00 p.m.): Panevezys [Panevezio] county State
Food and Veterinary Service (SFVS) got a phone call from the farm
about the increased mortality of pigs. Official inspectors arrived on
the farm same day. Findings on the farm: 56 diseased pigs (no typical
CSF symptoms), 287 clinically healthy. [They were informed that] due
to disease, 102 pigs had been culled and/or killed during the period
17 Feb-25 Jun 2009.

3. 26 Jun 2009: Samples taken for bacteriology investigation
(_Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae_, pasteurellosis, colibacteriosis).
Samples negative.

4. 30 Jun 2009: A phone call and e-mail received from the CVO of
Denmark. He reported that samples from Lithuania tested positive for
CSF in antibody ELISA test and that the same 2 samples were positive
for CSF in RT-PCR. On the same day, it was proposed to the owner to
cull the pigs. The decision of the owner was to start culling the
pigs. 71 pigs were culled and brought to the rendering plant.

5. 1 Jul 2009: By the Order of Panevezys county SFVS, standstill was
established from/to the farms owned by the same company in Panevezys
county, namely a breeding farm in Rabikiai village and a fattening
farm with 47 000 pigs in Pasodele village. Official samples taken: 149
serum samples and 5 for pathologic investigation. 89 pigs were culled
and brought to the rendering plant.

6. 2 Jul 2009: Primary investigation of 149 serum samples, 92
serologically positive, 4 doubtful and 53 negative against CSF virus
antibodies. All (149) [remaining] pigs culled and brought to the
rendering plant. Primary disinfection of the farm. 500 samples taken
from the fattening farm. All with negative results for CSF antibodies.

7. 3 Jul 2009: Continuation of disinfection of the farm.

8. 5 Sep 2009: Samples taken from the backyards in the nearest
territory (at least in the zone of 3 km)

9. 7-9 Jul 2009: A national expert from the National Food and
Veterinary Risk Assessment Institute of Lithuania went to the Danish
Veterinary Institute to participate in testing of the samples
(sequencing).

10. 9 Jul 2009: 54 samples from the backyards investigated with
negative results. 5 samples taken from wild boar, results negative;
another 300 samples taken from fattening farm.

11. 9-10 Jul 2009: 2 experts from EU Commission and Denmark were
invited to Lithuania in relation with the possible suspected and
unclear case of CSF.

12. 10 Jul 2009: Lithuania informs the EU Commission, Member States
and neighboring countries about the suspected case. By the Order of
the SFVS Director, a standstill was established on the movement of
pigs from and to the country. The bio-security measures were
strengthened, all the measures established according to Council
Directive 2001/89.

An e-mail was received from Denmark reporting that the National
Veterinary Institute at Lindholm had detected CSFV RNA in 10 blood
samples (collected 19 Jun 2009) from the herd Saerimner Karantne
Litauen in Lithuania using real-time RT-PCR. A herd with that name
does not exist in Lithuania. Now waiting for results from National
Food and Veterinary Risk Assessment Institute. At 7 p.m. same day,
positive PCR result received from the National Food and Veterinary
Risk Assessment Institute addressing the breeding farm.

13. 11 Jul 2009: Lithuania [officially] declares the case of classical
swine fever.

c. CSF surveillance in the area
---------------------------
2008
- 61 wild boars tested negative
- 59 domestic pigs tested negative

2009 (before the outbreak)
- 8 wild boars tested negative, more investigations ongoing
- 59 domestic pigs tested negative

d. Actions taken
----------------
1. Intensive clinical and laboratory surveillance is being carried out
in commercial pig holdings throughout the country and in particular
contact holdings according to CSF diagnostic manual laid down in
Decision 2002/106/EC. As of today [14 Jul 2009], 1201 samples already
collected, of which 679 were tested, all with negative ELISA
antibodies results and 89 negative RT-PCR.

2. Ban for dispatching of pigs from Lithuania.

3. Samples are taken for laboratory investigation from pig holdings
that have dispatched pigs to other countries during the last 2 months;
as from next week, if all controls are negative, a derogation will be
possible to dispatch pigs to outside Lithuania only for direct
transport to the slaughterhouse under authorization by competent
authority following satisfactory clinical and laboratory results in
accordance with CSF diagnostic manual.

4. From 10 Jul 2009, reduced introduction of pigs from other countries

5. Strict implementation of measures foreseen in Directive 2001/89/EC,
in particular in 3 km and 10 km restriction zones

6. Tests of samples from hunted and dead wild boars are performed

7. Monitoring of pigs on backyard farms within 3 km and 10 km radius
around the focus is carried out

8. Supply of information to the population within the protection and
surveillance zone and to the public at large is provided

9. Official veterinarian has been assigned to a contact holding UAB
Pasodele within the restricted area in Panevezys county

10. Official veterinarian has been designated to a rendering plant UAB
Rietavo veterinarine sanitarija in Telsiai county

11. Information campaign in all the country

12. Review of the above measures in place in the light of the new
epidemiological information available.

e. Genotyping of the virus performed in the National Food and
Veterinary Risk Assessment Institute.
-------------------
Result: CSF virus type 2.1
Active CSF in Member States is virus type 2.3 (Germany, France,
Slovakia and Hungary).
Last notified 2.1:
- Israel 2009
- South Africa 2007
- Asia 2007, highest sequence similarity.
2.1 formerly in Germany 1997, Netherlands 1997/98/ and UK 2000.

f. Conclusions:
1. Wild boar population seems not affected;
2. No evidence of disease in backyard herds;
3. Possible virus introduction - middle of May 2009;
4. Slowly progressing course of disease within the farm;
5. No clear post-mortem findings indicative for CSF;
6. Biosecurity in place; deficiencies have been observed;
7. Introduction (possible) having taken place by human activities.

[The detailed report on the evolution of this event in Lithuania
provides a valuable opportunity to follow a scenario which is
certainly not exceptional. This is a useful lesson for epidemiology
students. Epidemiology is an eventful detection story/thriller;
reading the above chronology, those involved in the prevention and
control of infectious diseases in animals will certainly be reminded
of many a similar situation during their respective careers.

Genotyping has become a tremendous tool in solving epidemiological
riddles by tracing back sources of infection. Open access to the
sequencing results will be useful to all parties involved, directly or
potentially. There are several exemplary transparent publications of
sequencing data, such as the molecular epidemiology page of the world
reference laboratory for FMD at Pirbright. One hopes that such
applications will be followed by other, if not all, OIE reference
laboratories, including those responsible for CSF diagnosis.

It will be interesting to follow the further findings and, in
particular, the details of the "human activities" suspected to be
responsible for the introduction of the virus into the "High
biosecurity (SPF conditions) farm," which -- as suggested by the
investigators -- probably might have taken place in mid May 2009. -
