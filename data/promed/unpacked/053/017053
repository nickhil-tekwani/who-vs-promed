Health state minister Sarah Opendi officially launched a mass measles immunization campaign in 2015. A new outbreak has hit Kampala.

Uganda's Ministry of Health has confirmed there is an active outbreak of measles in Kampala and Wakiso Districts. All the 5 divisions of Kampala, as well as several suburbs in Wakiso District, are affected.

According to a statement released Tue [8 Aug 2017], the Ministry of Health surveillance and case finding reports indicate a total of 67 cases have so far been identified.

Of the 67 cases, 7 have been confirmed by laboratory tests within the month of July 2017. The most affected age group are children under one year.

According to Prof. Anthony K. Mbonye, Director General of Health Services, the ministry has started several measures to control the spread of the disease.

"The ministry is investigating the extent of spread of measles within the districts of Kampala and Wakiso and conducting sensitization programmes to educate the public about the signs, symptoms and dangers of the disease," said Mbonye.

The health officials are also undertaking immunization programmes of children and management of all suspected cases

He appealed to the public to avoid direct contact with children infected or suspected to be infected with the disease and report and immediately take any suspected children to nearby health facilities.

Mbonye urged parents to take unvaccinated children under 5 years of age for immunization to the nearest health facilities.

The measles epidemic spreading throughout Taraba affects primarily children aged under 5.

140 cases of measles have been reported across 10 local governments in Taraba, according to its Commissioner of Health, Dr. Innocent Vakkai.

Vakkai told newsmen on Wed [9 Aug 2017] in Jalingo that the majority of those affected were children below 5 years who had not been vaccinated.

He said that the disease, a leading killer in developing countries like Nigeria, was showing a steady rise in Taraba.

The official regretted that Nigeria had remained the leading country in measles, with many of the cases recorded in northern states including Taraba.

To check the trend, he said that government had embarked on a massive measles campaign with more personnel trained and deployed to ensure wide and effective coverage.

"During the campaign, measles vaccination cards will be given to mothers to signify coverage. Children between 9 and 59 months without the card will be considered not immunised," he said.

Vakkai advised parents to make their children available for the exercise so as to rid the state of the disease.

Three more cases of measles have been confirmed in an outbreak affecting Newport and Torfaen. Cases have risen to 16 since June 2017. And with the new school term just a few weeks away, Public Health Wales is urging parents to make sure their children have had 2 doses of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine before classes begin again.

Consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales Dr Rhianwen Stiff said: "In our current outbreak, we have seen measles pass between pupils at the same school. With children returning from holidays in Europe, and with our ongoing outbreak in Newport and Torfaen, we are concerned that the start of the new term could lead to further cases of measles in Wales. Measles is highly contagious and passes very easily between people who are unvaccinated. The message is simple, MMR offers the best and only protection against measles. If you, or your child, are not up to date with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine, speak to your GP surgery immediately."

Parents are also being urged not to take children who appear to have measles to hospital or a GP surgery without calling ahead 1st.

A vaccination programme in schools across Newport was launched following the 1st outbreak, with 1089 children receiving immunisation.

Adults born after 1970 who have never had measles or the MMR vaccine are also being urged to contact their GP to arrange immunisation, especially if they work with children.

The 1st dose of the vaccine is usually given to babies between 12 and 13 months, and the 2nd at around 3 years, 4 months. But it can be given at any time.

The cases are being directly linked to a larger outbreak in Europe, which has affected 14 000 people, 35 of whom have died, since the start of the year [2017].
