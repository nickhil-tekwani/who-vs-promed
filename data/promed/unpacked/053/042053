Elderly Ontario Resident Dies After Contracting West Nile Virus Infection
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
An elderly man from Mississauga, Ontario, died over the weekend after
contracting the mosquito-borne West Nile virus, but health officials
said on Mon 16 Sep 2002 that an autopsy would be necessary to
determine the cause of death. The man's death came swiftly after it
was confirmed on Fri 15 Sep 2002 that he, along with 2 other southern
Ontario men, had the potentially deadly virus.
Authorities wouldn't reveal how long he had been ill. The autopsy was
to be conducted on Monday. If it is confirmed West Nile was the cause
of death, the unnamed man would be the second Canadian to have
succumbed to West Nile virus infection, a virus that has killed 66 in
the United States this year.
"I can confirm that one of 3 confirmed cases of West Nile virus has
passed away, however we can't confirm that that was the cause of
death," said Ontario Health Ministry spokesman David Jensen. "The
coroner's investigating because it was a situation where the person
had a number of health problems, so the coroner is determining what
exactly was the cause of death."
