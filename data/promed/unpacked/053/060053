ANGIOSTRONGYLOSIS, FOX - SWITZERLAND

The tripling of the fox population in Switzerland in the past decade has
markedly influenced the prevalence and incidence of parasitic diseases.
Thus mange (skin infestation by _Sarcoptes_ sp.) and echinococcosis
(infection with _Echinococcus multilocularis_) have become important issues.
In 2001, we reported the identification of a newly established wild life
cycle of _Angiostrongylus vasorum_ in foxes living in the vicinity of
Basel, a city in the north of Switzerland. Within the past few years, 5
cases have been found in domestic dogs living in the same area.
Autochthony has been assumed by the diagnosing veterinarians, but could not
be proven due to some dogs' tendency to change location. Similarly, 3 cases
in domestic dogs have been reported in the canton of Ticino (southern,
Italian part of Switzerland). Here again, the proximity to the known
endemic area of Italy and traveling activities of the dogs (or their
owners) could not prove autochthonous transmission of the parasite.
In the frame of a fox survey project in Switzerland addressing mange as a
main topic, we also carried out appropriate coprological analyses to search
for lungworm larvae. Recently we found 2 foxes infected with _A. vasorum_.
One fox originated in the canton of Geneva (Western part of Switzerland)
and one from the canton of Valais (southwestern part of Switzerland). The 2
foxes were too far from each other to belong to the same endemic herd, and
also the distance to the known endemic area of Basel is too far to claim
any direct link between the affected fox populations.
Given our new findings in wild foxes, we conclude that _A. vasorum_ has
spread and become established in new geographical areas of Switzerland.
Thus, we recommend that all veterinarians working in the newly affected
Cantons of Switzerland to pay particular attention to the local dog
population (symptomatology: pulmonary and functional circulatory disorders,
optionally leukocytosis and eosinophilia). Furthermore, because similar
events may occur in the neighbouring countries (Germany, Austria, and
France), we wish the respective veterinarians to focus their attention on
this emerging problem.
