NT melon farmers' 2-year growing ban to stop virus
--------------------------------------------------
Farmers near Katherine in the Northern Territory [NT] have been told a 2-year ban on growing watermelons in the region will be established by the NT Department of Primary Industry (DPI) to stop the spread of the cucumber green mottle mosaic virus.

The department said tests conducted in September [2014] have confirmed the virus is present in the region, which is the 1st time the virus has ever been found in Australia.

[A farmer] who grows 4500 tonnes of melons each year, said, "It's extremely disheartening." Growers were told the quarantine, which will require all crops to be destroyed, is imminent. "We've got to glyphosate the crop, then once it's dried off we have to heap up the watermelon bushes, dig a big hole and burn them."

NT DPI's Peter Stacey says, "We now have a total of 7 properties where we either have confirmed or suspected infection. We are urgently looking at what quarantine measures need to be in place [and] exactly where, within the next 1 to 2 days at the latest." He says the quarantine area will most likely include around 10 properties in the Katherine region.

There will be a number of support options for the farmers affected. [The farmer said], "If there's a virus that could effect the rest of the watermelon industry, we need to, as an industry, protect it. So we understand fully why it needs to happen."

Western Australia worried about watermelon virus confirmed in NT
----------------------------------------------------------------
Western Australian [WA] farmers are concerned about the spread of _Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV), which has been confirmed across the border in the Northern Territory. Melon growers in the Ord [irrigation region], 500 km [311 mi] from Katherine, say it's extremely worrying news.

[A farmer said], "We know it will have a big impact if it reaches this area." One of her main concerns is just how easily the virus can spread. She says measures [taken in the NT] may already be too late. "The virus was detected in July [2014]. Since then, thousands of tonnes of watermelons have been sent to the markets in Sydney and Melbourne. I cannot imagine that there was not infected produce and seeds in there. We don't know how far the virus has already spread."

She also says it's not only those growers in close proximity to Katherine who are at risk. "It could go [via] the markets in Adelaide and Perth. The areas down south can be infected as well."

The WA Department of Agriculture and Food (DAFWA) says it's working with NT authorities and other jurisdictions on a coordinated response to CGMMV. DAFWA says they are watching watermelons entering the state very closely. They are still deliberating if officers will be sent to check on WA plantations and are asking growers to keep watch for the virus. [DAFWA is] also monitoring other produce, like pumpkins and melons, which potentially could be infected, [but] wasn't sure if such products had been stopped from coming into WA.

[_Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) is a major pathogen of cucurbit crops with reported yield losses of around 15 percent. The virus has a narrow host range limited to the Cucurbitaceae. The type strain affects cucumber and occurs in Europe; a watermelon strain is reported from Japan; unspecified strains are reported from India (gourds, muskmelon), China (multiple hosts) and, recently, the US (muskmelon; ProMED-mail post 20131219.2124396). Symptoms vary in different host species and may be masked in field crops. They may include severe leaf mosaic, deformation of vines and internal fruit symptoms such as discolouration and rotting of flesh.

CGMMV is both seed and pollen transmitted. It is extremely stable and can also be spread by mechanical means (human activities, insect damage, plant-to-plant contact), with contaminated agricultural tools, infected plant material, in water and contaminated soil. Spread by specific insect vectors appears doubtful. Disease management may include removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitary practices, and use of certified clean seed or other planting material. Transgenic rootstock lines of some cucurbit crops (including watermelon) with resistance to CGMMV have been or are being developed.

With the presence of CGMMV now confirmed, it would be important to identify the source(s) and route of entry into Australia to prevent further incursions. From item 2 above, it appears that the potential risk of spreading the virus within the country would need to be addressed much more rigorously.
