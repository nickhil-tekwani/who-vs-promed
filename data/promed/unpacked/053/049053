The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and others, have been investigating a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Senftenberg infections, and they are linked to certain Jif peanut butter products produced at the J M Smucker Company facility in Lexington, Kentucky, and distributed [throughout the US], according to a recall alert posted by the FDA on 20 May [2022]. CDC's review of epidemiological information indicated that 5 people who were infected said they had eaten peanut butter, and 4 of the 5 specifically reported that they ate different varieties of Jif brand peanut butter before they got sick.

The FDA had previously conducted a whole-genome sequencing analysis on a sample collected at the Lexington J M Smucker facility in 2010. The FDA's recent analysis showed that this 2010 environmental sample matches the strain causing illnesses in this current outbreak.

"Epidemiologic evidence indicates that Jif brand peanut butter produced in the J M Smucker Company facility located in Lexington, Kentucky, is the likely cause of illnesses in this outbreak," the FDA reported. J M Smucker Company voluntarily recalled certain Jif brand peanut butter products that have lot code numbers between 1274425 and 2140425 that were manufactured in Lexington.

As of May 21 2022, a total of 14 people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella_ Senftenberg have been reported from 12 states (see map at URL above). Illnesses started on dates ranging from 17 Feb 2022 through 1 May 2022.

Sick people range in age from less than one to 85 years (median 56), and 71% are female. Of 6 people with information available, 2 have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

The true number of sick people in an outbreak is likely much higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses. This is because many people recover without medical care and are not tested for salmonella. In addition, recent illnesses may not yet be reported as it usually takes 2 to 4 weeks to determine if a sick person is part of an outbreak.

State and local public health officials are interviewing people about the foods they ate in the week before they got sick. Of the five people interviewed, five (100%) reported eating peanut butter. Four of five (80%) sick people reported Jif brand peanut butter. Two people reported Jif Creamy Reduced Fat peanut butter, one person reported Jif Natural Creamy Low Sodium peanut butter, and one person reported Jif Natural Creamy peanut butter. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from eating peanut butter.

Laboratory data
Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify illnesses that may be part of this outbreak. CDC PulseNet manages a national database of DNA fingerprints of bacteria that cause foodborne illnesses. DNA fingerprinting is performed on bacteria using a method called whole genome sequencing (WGS). WGS showed that bacteria from sick people's samples are closely related genetically. This suggests that people in this outbreak got sick from the same food.

WGS analysis shows that samples from sick people in this investigation are closely related genetically to a sample collected in 2010 from the environment at J.M. Smucker Company's facility in Lexington, KY, where some Jif brand peanut butter is produced.

WGS analysis of bacteria from 14 people's samples did not predict resistance to any antibiotics. Standard antibiotic susceptibility testing by CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) laboratory is currently under way.

Public health actions
On 20 May 2022, J M Smucker Company recalled multiple Jif brand peanut butter types. Do not eat, sell, or serve recalled Jif brand peanut butter.

[Although not a common vehicle for human salmonellosis, peanut butter has been described with different serotypes in the past: Bredeney, Typhimurium, and Tennessee. In addition to these USA outbreaks, an outbreak of salmonellosis (serotype Mbandaka) reported from Australia in 1996 was related to peanut butter, with the organism isolated from both peanut butter and patients (1,2). Burnett and colleagues (3) studied peanut butters that had been experimentally inoculated with _Salmonella_ and had viable organisms at 5 deg C [41 deg F] for 24 weeks. There was less retention at 21 deg C [70 deg F]. More importantly, Shachar and Yaron (4) demonstrated that thermal treatments are inadequate to consistently destroy salmonella in highly contaminated peanut butter and that the pasteurization process cannot be improved significantly by longer treatment or higher temperatures.
