Bass virus found at Crawford
----------------------------
Biologists have found a virus within largemouth bass at Crawford State
Fishing Lake. A decline in bass within the 150 acre lake led to testing for
the disease appropriately called largemouth bass virus (LMBV).
Kansas is the 18th state to confirm the virus that was 1st discovered in
Florida in 1991. Often fatal to largemouths [bass], the disease has never
been known to pass on to humans.
The appearance of the virus at Crawford is especially troubling because
it's the water source for the Kansas Department of Wildlife and Park's
Farlington Fish Hatchery. Doug Nygren, Wildlife and Parks fisheries chief,
said no fish would be moved from the hatchery to other waters until more
tests are done.
Several other species of fish can have the virus, including smallmouth bass
and crappie -- though it's only been fatal to largemouths. As well as one
of the most popular sportfish in Kansas, largemouth bass are an important
predator for keeping populations like carp, bluegill, and crappie in check.
Largemouth bass of 2 pounds and larger appear to be the most vulnerable.
Nygren said while there are still a lot of mysteries about the virus, it
doesn't appear to cause long term damage to fish populations. Still,
boaters and anglers are asked to follow procedures that help prevent the
spread of invasive species and diseases. That includes the emptying of
livewells and bilge water before leaving a lake.

[The virus has been found in wild fish from 15 states: Alabama, Arkansas,
Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri,
Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas.
The virus appears to attack the swim bladder due to the yellow or brown,
waxy residue often present in the bladder of infected fish. Moribund fish
(those about to die) are often found floating on the surface, swimming in
circles. There are no external lesions (sores) associated with the virus.
Although stressing factors such as warm water temperatures, low dissolved
oxygen, poor water quality, and poor handling have often been associated
with kills involving the LMBV; there is no evidence that these stressing
factors directly contribute to the presence or lethality of the virus.
However, infected fish that appear healthy and unstressed have not been
known to die as a result of the virus.
The virus has been found to survive in live-wells for up to 4 hours, and
boats traveling between waters may spread the virus. Other ways that the
virus may be transmitted include spread by amphibians, largemouth bass
stockings, and fish-to-fish contact.
Many people want to know if the fish can be eaten. It is recommended that
they thoroughly cooked as a precaution, but there is no similar virus known
to infect human beings.

Pittsburg, KS, near the south eastern corner of the state.
