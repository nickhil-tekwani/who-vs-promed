The Taiwan CDC [Centers for Disease Control] reported 30 indigenous cases of hepatitis A for the 2-month period of October through November 2014, in which more than 80 percent of the patients required hospitalization for their illness. According to the epidemiological investigation, most patients consumed raw bivalves such as oysters and clams during the disease incubation period. This has prompted the Taiwan CDC to remind the public to pay attention to personal dietary hygiene and consume only thoroughly cooked bivalves. Bivalves such as oysters and clams concentrate the pathogens that are present in harvest waters.

According to the CDC, hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the hepatitis A virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. Hepatitis A is usually spread when a person ingests fecal matter, even in microscopic amounts, from contact with objects, food, or drinks contaminated by feces or stool from an infected person. Not everyone has symptoms. If symptoms develop, they usually appear 2 to 6 weeks after becoming infected and can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine, and jaundice.

There is no specific treatment once symptoms appear, but a vaccination can help lessen the effects of the disease if given within 14 days of exposure.

The best way to control the spread of hepatitis A and many other illnesses is through proper hand washing, especially after using the restroom, changing diapers, and before eating or preparing food. Hand washing should include 20 seconds of vigorous soaping of all parts of the hands, especially between fingers and under fingernails.

[Bivalve shellfish such as oysters, clams, and mussels have a unique habitat and feeding mechanism by which they can become an important vehicle of transmission of hepatitis A virus (HAV). Shellfish are filter feeders, and they absorb food particles and nutrients by filtering out the seawater, and, therefore, they tend to concentrate the virus if the water becomes contaminated by sewage or other means. HAV is heat resistant and able to withstand steaming. As a result, humans can contract HAV after consumption of contaminated bivalves not thoroughly cooked.

The 1st documented shellfish-associated outbreak of hepatitis dates back to 1955 when 629 cases were associated with consumption of raw oysters. The largest reported outbreak occurred in China in 1988 when nearly 300 000 persons were infected after consumption of clams harvested from a sewage-contaminated area.

The government of the Hong Kong special administrative region recommends the following measures for the public for buying and consuming shellfish: buy only fresh shellfish with intact shells free from any odour; do not buy shellfish from illegal hawkers or unlicensed food premises; scrub and rinse shellfish in clean water; cook shellfish at boiling temperatures for at least 5 minutes before eating; do not eat raw mud oysters; remove the shell before cooking as the shell impedes heat penetration; remove the viscera of the shellfish before cooking, and use separate chopsticks and utensils for handling raw and cooked food to avoid cross-contamination (http://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fm_02_06.html). - Mod.SN

Viruses were originally described as agents that could pass through filters that would hold back other infectious agents such as bacteria. Although we often look at the bivalves feeding mechanism, a filtration system, as why certain viruses such as hepatitis A and norovirus are concentrated in the tissues of these creatures, viruses are too small to be filtered out in the oyster or clam the way _Salmonella_ Typhi and _Vibrio vulnificus_ would be.

The following is extracted from: Provost K, Dancho BA, Ozbay G, et al: Hemocytes are sites of enteric virus persistence within oysters. Appl Environ Microbiol. 2011; 77(23): 8360-9; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21948840, with the reference citations removed:

The mechanism by which small virus particles are bioconcentrated by bivalve shellfish is an open question, since ciliated gill filaments, which filter microorganisms from the water column, are spaced as far as 500 to 600 nm apart in shellfish. It has been suggested that rather than being trapped directly by gill filaments, virus particles become bound electrostatically to sulfate groups on the mucopolysaccharides of shellfish mucus. In more recent studies, Le Guyader et al and Tian et al independently showed that human norovirus can interact with specific glycoproteins that may mimic human glycoproteins thought to function as cell surface receptors for initiation of norovirus infection within the human host. Le Guyader et al also reported detection of norovirus in association with oyster hemocytes. Recent research also indicates that noroviruses can interact with zooplankton, providing a potential means of entrapment by bivalve gill cilia. At present, it is not known if other viruses, such as HAV, hepatitis E virus, poliovirus, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and astroviruses, are bioconcentrated via analogous mechanisms.

McLeod et al found that virus bioconcentration occurs within the digestive tract, and they identified poliovirus in the gills and labial palps. Overall, the processes of uptake and dissemination of virus particles within bivalve tissues have been studied more extensively, while comparatively little research has been directed toward understanding the mechanism by which infectious viruses remain within bivalve shellfish and avoid being purged, digested, or otherwise destroyed by shellfish digestive processes. - Mod.LL]

[The fact that 80 per cent of these patients were hospitalized suggests there may be many more undetected cases. Hospitalization is not usually required for Hepatitis A, so these may be the tip of the iceberg. - Mod.LM
