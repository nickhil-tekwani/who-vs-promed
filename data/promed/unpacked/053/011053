Remainder of South Berwick pheasant flock killed by triple E is euthanized
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
After about 125 pheasants at a town farm died from eastern equine
encephalitis [EEE] in recent weeks, the rest of the flock was euthanized on
Monday [28 Sep 2009]. The move came on the same day the disease was
confirmed in a 2nd pheasant flock in York County.

About 80 pheasants at a farm in Parsonsfield recently died from EEE,
according to Scott Lindsay, a biologist for the Maine Department of Inland
Fisheries and Wildlife. The remaining 120 birds in the flock will be
euthanized today [29 Sep 2009], he said. About 125 pheasants at the South
Berwick farm were euthanized on Monday [28 Sep 2009]. Wildlife officials
declined to release the names of the farms, citing privacy concerns.

In both towns, the birds likely contracted the disease from an infected
mosquito and spread it in a cannibalistic manner -- a common behavior in
those birds, said Don Hoenig, state veterinarian for the agriculture
department.

The pheasants were brought to Maine as chicks and raised for hunting
purposes in a cooperative with the inland fisheries department and local
rod and gun clubs. Pheasant season begins on 1 Oct 2009, with 23 sites
available for public hunting during the rest of the month.

Hoenig said there has been an unusually large number of incidences of EEE
in animals this year [2009]. The disease has already killed 14 horses in 5
counties. Hoenig said in his 23 years in the agriculture department, he has
never seen the disease in pheasants.

The spread of the disease could be attributed to a combination of factors,
including a wet summer producing a bumper crop of mosquitoes, the
appearance of new migratory birds, and a lack of horses being vaccinated,
Hoenig said. As fall temperatures set in and frost occurs, incidences of
the disease should drop, he said.

Euthanizing the pheasants is a precautionary measure, wildlife officials
say, as the disease is deadly in both humans and animals. Mosquitoes carry
and transmit the disease to humans and animals through a bite. About a
third of people who contract the disease die, while the majority of
survivors have significant brain damage. There is no specific treatment for
EEE; care is based on symptoms.

The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention has urged people to
take typical precautions against mosquitoes to prevent EEE, including using
an insect repellent that contains DEET; wearing long clothing when
outdoors; limiting outdoor activities at dusk; and eliminating areas of
standing water, where mosquitoes thrive. Hoenig said horse owners should
inoculate the animals against the disease as well.

The discovery of EEE at the South Berwick farm is the 3rd recent incident
of the disease being found in the Seacoast region. A case in Rochester, NH,
was discovered after University of New Hampshire laboratory experiments
revealed the virus in 2 dead pet canaries.

City manager John Scruton declined to say where in the city the pets lived,
but said it was not around any schools or public playgrounds. In Dover, a
mosquito pool near Tolend Road tested positive for eastern equine
encephalitis, though the insects were of the melanura species, which only
feeds on birds and not humans.

The NH Department of Health and Human Services lists all of Rockingham
County as a high level risk area for EEE.

Tiverton horse tests positive for EEE
-------------------------------------
The Department of Environmental Management (DEM) received confirmation last
week [week of 21 Sep 2009] from the Rhode Island Department of Health
laboratory that a horse from Tiverton has tested positive for EEE. As a
result of the positive finding, DEM will set additional mosquito traps in
Tiverton and Little Compton.

DEM's Division of Agriculture was notified on 21 Sep 2009 that the horse
had been displaying neurological symptoms of EEE for about 18 hours. DEM's
state veterinarian, Scott Marshall, DVM, euthanized the comatose animal and
submitted samples to the laboratory for analysis. The specimen tested
negative for rabies. The 2 year old horse had not been properly vaccinated
against EEE.

A DEM spokesperson confirmed that the horse was living at a farm on East
Road. They are not releasing the name of the owner.

The commonest signs of viral encephalitis in horses are depression,
stumbling, in-coordination, hind limb weakness, partial paralysis, and
muscle twitching. Fever can occur but is not present in all cases. These
signs can occur in many equine diseases and should be reported to a
veterinarian as soon as they are noticed so that a quick and accurate
diagnosis can be made.

Horse barns are environments where mosquitoes can reproduce in large
numbers. Horse owners are advised to protect themselves by using
appropriate repellants and wearing protective clothing. They should also
inspect barns for mosquito breeding areas and take measures to eliminate
collected or stagnant water such as feed troughs and water basins. Horses
should not be turned out to pasture and paddock during dawn, dusk, and at
night as these are times when mosquitoes are usually the most active.

Horse owners who would like more information should contact their
veterinarian, or may call Marshall at DEM's Division of Agriculture at
401-222-2781, Ext. 4503.

Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is transmitted to humans by the
bite of an infected mosquito. Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) is a rare
illness in humans, and only a few cases are reported in the United States
each year. Most cases occur in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. Most
persons infected with EEEV have no apparent illness. Severe cases of EEE
(involving encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain) begin with the
sudden onset of headache, high fever, chills, and vomiting. The illness may
then progress into disorientation, seizures, or coma.

EEE is one of the most severe mosquito-transmitted diseases in the United
States with approximately 33 per cent mortality and significant brain
damage in most survivors. There is no specific treatment for EEE; care is
based on symptoms. You can reduce your risk of being infected with EEEV by
using insect repellent, wearing protective clothing, and staying indoors
while mosquitoes are most active. If you think you or a family member may
have EEE, it is important to consult your healthcare provider for proper
diagnosis.

Pheasants are the one bird where EEE can be maintained in a cannibalistic
manner of pecking each other.

Interesting is the comment that mosquitoes reproduce in barns. It seems
mosquitoes require water and while there are water troughs in barns, most
of the troughs and buckets are clean and not stagnant reproduction pools.
While there are clearly barns that may benefit from a cleaning, it is
generally the exception not the rule with horse people. However, all horse
owners and stable mangers should promote and use vaccines to protect the
horses from EEE.
