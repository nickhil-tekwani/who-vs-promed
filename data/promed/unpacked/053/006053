Nigerian health officials are working to contain a resurgence of Lassa
fever, a highly infectious disease that has killed at least 8 people
in the past month (February 2009]. The World Health Organization (WHO)
said over 93 cases of the virus [infection] had been confirmed in the
capital Abuja and neighboring Nasarawa state since December [2008].

At the Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital in Edo state, confirmed
cases rose by 60 percent from December 2008 to January 2009. "That is
a major increase, and, furthermore, these are just the cases we hear
about in hospital," Marguerite Lamunu, WHO Lassa fever expert, told
IRIN. "In reality, there will probably be many more cases and deaths
in the community, plus the disease is spreading from state to state."

Lassa fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic condition transmitted
through contact with the urine or feces of rodents, especially rats
and shrews. It was 1st discovered in 1969 in the town of Lassa in
northern Nigeria's Borno state. Lassa fever can also be transmitted
through direct contact with the bodily fluids and feces of an
infected person or through airborne particles, according to Osi-Ogbu.

"We have an epidemic on our hands," Ogugua Osi-Ogbu, head of Lassa
fever prevention and care at the National Hospital in Abuja (NHA),
told IRIN. The disease, which has an incubation period of one to 3
weeks, has become endemic in parts of West Africa, where it kills at
least 5000 people each year among 300 000 to 500 000 cases, according
to WHO. The illness is especially severe late in pregnancy, killing
the fetus and/or the mother in more than 80 percent of cases.

The Nigerian Federal Ministry of Health has alerted all 36 state
Health Ministries, directing them to step up public awareness
campaigns on preventing Lassa fever. "We have embarked on a rigorous
campaign on the radio to sensitize our people on the dangers of Lassa
fever, how it is contracted and effective measures to avoid
infection," Kano State Health Commissioner Aisha Isyaku Kiru told
IRIN. "We are specifically calling on the people to observe and
improve community hygiene through proper refuse disposal to
discourage rats from taking refuge, and keeping food and drinking
water in containers not accessible to rats," Kiru said.

According to residents, many ethnic groups consume rodents,
especially rats, hedgehogs and badgers. Undergrowth is often burned
to smoke out rodents for ''bush meat," as it is known locally,
driving the animals to take shelter in homes, thereby increasing the
risk of Lassa fever infection. "Rodents are a source of meat to many
of our people and the government needs to ban their consumption to
effectively contain Lassa fever spread," said Bernard Ayorchia, a
private medical doctor in the central Nigerian city of Makurdi.

Another hurdle in tackling Lassa in Nigeria is the lack of
laboratories. Only 2 facilities, in the southern states of Lagos and
Edo, are equipped to diagnose the illness. Initial symptoms, which
include headache, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea,
vomiting, diarrhea and coughing, are similar to those of malaria,
which can also make diagnosing Lassa fever difficult, according to
the WHO. Severe cases may progress to bleeding from the mouth, nose,
vagina or gastrointestinal tract. In late stages, seizures, shock,
tremors and coma can occur.

"The government must urgently provide laboratories for diagnosing
Lassa fever in all parts of the country," said NHA's Osi-Ogbu. "Early
detection of the virus and a prompt response are key in saving the
life of an infected person."

WHO plans in the coming days to send an evaluation team to affected
states in Nigeria to assess the scale of the outbreak.

[It is clear from the reaction of the Nigerian healthcare authorities
that the epidemic of Lassa fever is continuing to spread, but its
true extent is difficult to assess. The estimated figure of at least
8 fatalities and 93 confirmed cases has not changed since the
previous report from Nigeria on 24 Feb 2009. It is stated also that
the epidemic is spreading beyond the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)
and Nasarawa, but the other states now affected are not named. The
emphasis of the report concerns rodent control, but it would be
relevant also to determine the extent of person-to-person
transmission of infection in the development of the epidemic and to
provide appropriate advice.
