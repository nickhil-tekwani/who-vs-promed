According to Franzusova, head of Rospotrebnadzor [the Federal Service for
Monitoring Consumer Rights and Human Welfare] a 6 year old girl was bitten
by a rat in the grounds of a kindergarten on 2 Aug 2007. Investigations,
which have been carried by the city veterinary bacteriological laboratory,
have detected rabies in the animal. The rat had bitten the girl in a room
of the kindergarten on her return from a walk.
As a result, concern has been expressed about the unsatisfactory
performance of the municipal services regarding the control of rodents in
multistorey buildings and mismanagement by the authorities responsible for
the care of children in kindergarten. The injured child has been vaccinated
and is now under medical supervision. Rodent control measures are under way.

As of 5 Aug 2007, 123 cases of rabies among animals have been recorded in
the Samara Region, according to the local management of Rospotrebnadzor in
the region. The numbers of cases of rabies among animals are significant in
23 areas of the Samara Region. A total of 227 people have been exposed to
animals with clinically and laboratory confirmed rabies.
The territory of the Samara Region is located in a natural focus of fox
rabies. The epizootic situation with regard to animal rabies continues to
be regarded as serious. In 2006, inadequate control of rabies was apparent
in 18 administrative districts where cases of rabies had been recorded
among wild, domestic, and agricultural animals. In the current year [2007],
there has been a marked deterioration in the epizootic situation with
regard to rabies. The largest number of cases has been registered in the
Borsky, Kinell-Cherkassky, and Kinelsky districts. Of the rabid animals, 45
per cent were dogs and 40 per cent were foxes.

Activation of the natural foci of rabies in Russia as a result of warm
winter weather has resulted in spread of rabies among pets and wildlife and
raised the risk of rabies for people. Failure to vaccinate pets and delayed
recourse of those bitten for post-exposure treatment have contributed to
this situation. It should be noted that the vaccination of pets against
rabies in Russia is mandatory. - Mod.NP]
