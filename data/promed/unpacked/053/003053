S Korea confirms 2nd outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
-------------------------------------------------------
The government on Thursday [14 Jan 2010] said it has confirmed its 2nd
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak at a beef cattle farm in
Pocheon, 45 km [28 mi] north of Seoul.

The animals at the farm started showing FMD symptoms early Wednesday
[13 Jan 2009] causing local quarantine officials to order the culling
and burial of 15 heads of hanwoo beef cows, the Ministry for Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said.

The animals were at a farm 3.5 km [2 mi] away from where the 1st
outbreak was reported last week [7 Jan 2009; see ProMED-mail posting
Foot & mouth disease, bovine - South Korea: (KG), OIE 20100108.0089].

The ministry added that it would start culling livestock within a 500
meter [0.3 mi] radius of the cattle farm to prevent further outbreaks
of the highly contagious disease.

There are a total of 5 farms that raise 148 head of cattle and 2 deer
within the quarantine area and a farm that raises 1200 pigs.

[Most probably, this 2nd outbreak in South Korea is caused by the same
FMDV serotype A strain, which had been identified in the 1st outbreak
last week and that affected dairy cattle; it remains to be
investigated which of the 2 initially preceded the other. Since dairy
cattle are usually kept indoors, as opposed to grazing beef cattle,
the possibility that the latter was infected earlier deserves
investigation.

Sequencing results of the sample collected on 7 Jan 2010 and received
at the WRLFMD, Pirbright, UK on 8 Jan 2010, indicate close
relationship to Thai and Vietnamese isolates as follows: A/TAI/15/2008
(identity percentage 98.58); A/TAI/16/2008 (98.43); A/TAI/19/2008
(98.43); A/VN/02/2009 (98.43); A/VN/03/2009 (98.43). The topotype is
"ASIA", similar to the Thai and Vietnamese viruses above, as well as
the Chinese strain 'A-HuBWH-09', received at Pirbright on 25 Jan 2009.

The Molecular Epidemiology Report Form of the current S Korean virus
is available at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2010/WRLFMD-2010-0000A%20A%20South%20Korea%202010.pdf>. It may be assumed that the S Korean virus is related to the FMDV serotype A, which has been circulating and affecting cattle in China (at least) since early 2009; molecular confirmation (or otherwise) for such relationship is anticipated. The Molecular Epidemiology Report Form of the Chinese virus is available
at
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009/WRLFMD-2009-0000A-China-A.pdf>. -
Mod.AS]

[Note that alhough this outbreak is located relatively close to the
North Korean border, the serotype of the 2007 outbreak in North Korea
has been determined by the World Reference Laboratory to have been
Asia-1, not A -- see ProMED ref. below. - Mod.JW]
