Brown planthoppers have destroyed 6700 hectares [approx. 16 600
acres] of summer-autumn rice in central provinces, leaving crops with
ragged and stunted-rice disease. The pest infestation has also ruined
several thousand hectares of rice fields in northern and southern provinces.

Agricultural authorities have urged farmers to take preventive
measures, including spraying pesticides, spreading fertilizers, and
transplanting rice seedlings on schedule to prevent the spread of the
disease in rice fields.

[_Rice ragged stunt virus_ (RRSV; genus _Oryzavirus_) is known from a
number of countries in Asia with reported yield losses of up to 90
percent. Symptoms include ragged appearance of plants, twisted
leaves, vein swelling, unfilled grains, and severe stunting of
plants. Its only way of spread is vector transmission by brown
planthoppers (_Nilaparvata lugens_). The insects transmit the virus
in a persistent manner (RRSV replicates in the vector and is retained
during molting), but the virus is not passed on to the progeny
through eggs. Insects carrying RRSV remain infectious for life and
can be transported on air currents to spread the virus quickly over
long distances. Besides rice (_Oryza sativa_), other species in the
genus can also be affected.

In tropical regions, especially where rice is grown all year round,
levels of rice virus infection and vector density may be very high.
Disease management for rice viruses includes cultural practices,
vector control, and use of cultivars with reduced sensitivity or
resistance to the virus, the vector, or both. Cultivars resistant to
the vector have low disease incidence. The application of
insecticides to migratory planthoppers is being used in some areas to
reduce disease incidence.

_N. lugens_ is one of the worst pests of rice in the Australasian and
Pacific Island region. In addition to being a virus vector, it causes
yellowing, browning, and drying of plants ('hopper burn') and leaves
small injuries exposing the plant to fungal and bacterial infections.
Besides RRSV, it is also a vector of several other rice viruses.
Additional rice viruses are transmitted by other sap sucking leaf-
and planthoppers (_Nephotettix_ and _Laodelphax_ species). An
epidemic of _L. striatellus_, the vector of the very damaging _Rice
stripe virus_, has been reported recently from northern Viet Nam
(ProMED-mail post 20090608.2118).
