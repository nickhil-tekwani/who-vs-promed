US ARS: A newly discovered and sequenced turkey disease virus
-------------------------------------------------------------
A never-before-described virus infecting young turkeys has been
identified and its DNA sequence deciphered by Agricultural Research
Service (ARS) scientists in Athens, Georgia. The virus, which has caused
problems for southeastern poultry producers since the early 1990s, is now
circulating throughout the United States.
The virus is associated with Poult Enteritis Mortality Syndrome (PEMS), a
highly infectious, transmissible disease of young turkeys causing severe
diarrhea, stunted growth and high death rates in young flocks. PEMS is
also associated with lifelong changes to the turkey immune system
and leaves the birds highly susceptible to other infectious agents.
ARS scientist Stacey Schultz-Cherry's unit at the Southeast Poultry
Research Laboratory in Athens isolated the avian disease- causing
organism, called an astrovirus. Scientists isolated this small
virus--also associated with diarrhea outbreaks in humans and other
animals--from turkey poults infected with PEMS. Schultz-Cherry's group
has devised diagnostic tests and will now focus on how the virus causes
disease and how it affects the immune response. This information may lead
the way to vaccines for the emerging disease.
This particular astrovirus is very stable and resistant to disinfection,
so the research results could also be used to develop kits to test for
virus present in poultry houses that have been cleaned. Currently, poult
producers can only rely on proper disinfection and biosecurity procedures
to prevent infection of their flocks.
A patent on the sequence was filed in July 2001, and the sequence is
available for licensing. Diagnostic companies could utilize the
technology to make testing kits available to turkey producers. PEMS
outbreaks have cost the turkey industry millions of dollars in annual
losses.
The next step for the researchers is to determine the reservoir of this
astrovirus and to find out if the virus can move from turkeys to other
bird species.
ARS is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) principal scientific
research agency.
