[It is important to note that the 2 deaths reported above were "community deaths", in other words, the individuals died outside of the Ebola treatment centers. This creates a risk that others may have become infected handling the bodies of the deceased without proper personal protection.

The slow down of immunization activities is a serious problem as vaccination is the best protection available. Without it, case contacts potentially can spread the virus to new susceptible community members. -Mod.LK]

Situation update; data as reported by Sun 21 Oct 2018
----------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
----------
The increasing number of cases and contacts to be followed, mainly in the Beni health zone, requires strengthening human and material resources as well as medical input. However, continued security incidents have prevented the undertaking and upscaling of response activities in the affected communities. Response teams at every level, particularly those at the frontline of the response, have generated significant successes in community engagement, vaccinations, high-quality care at ETCs and contact tracing, despite these challenges, by working in close coordination with local leaders and community members. The rapid adjustment of the response teams' activities under these challenging conditions demonstrate the commitment of the Ministry of Health, WHO, and partners to stop this outbreak.

[CIDRAP, Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2018/10/ebola-cases-beni-top-100-6-more-cases-reported
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Medical teams have confirmed Ebola in 6 more people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak, all from the hot spot in Beni where violence over the weekend [20-21 Oct 2018] has slowed vaccination activities, the country's health ministry said today [23 Oct 2018].

Also, the World Health Organization (WHO) detailed renewed concerns about fresh violence undermining the response and the increasing numbers of Ebola infections in children.

Cases in Beni surpass 100
-------------------------
Of the 6 new confirmed cases reported today [23 Oct 2018], 2 involved patients who died in the community, which raise the risk of further spread, given that viral loads are highest when the illness is severe and at the time of death and that people who die outside of health settings were likely to have been cared for by family members and others who weren't adequately protected.

Getting sick people into isolation and treatment is a key part of the outbreak response, and continued reports of community deaths are a sign that responders are having a tough time identifying all active transmission chains.

The 6 new cases boost the outbreak total to 244 cases, including 209 confirmed and 35 probable cases. The new deaths bring the fatality total to 155.

In its daily update, the health ministry said cases in Beni health zone now stand at 102.

As feared following another round of rebel violence over the weekend, immunization activities in Beni are slowing owing to insecurity in some parts of the city, according to the health ministry. So far, 20 939 people have been vaccinated, including 9853 in Beni.

Security challenges, illnesses in children
------------------------------------------
In its regular situation report, the WHO said top concerns are the spike in cases over the past 4 weeks, especially in Beni, and the security challenges response teams are facing in Beni and Butembo.

"Continued security incidents severely impact both civilians and frontline workers, forcing suspension of EVD response activities and increasing the risk that the virus will continue to spread," it said. Vaccination in Beni could not take place in Beni on 21 Oct 2018 because of community demonstrations in the wake of attacks the day before, the WHO added. It also said investigations continue into the steady stream of confirmed cases that aren't from known transmission chains, a sign that the virus continues to spread undetected.

According to a Stat report today 23 Oct 2018, the increasing number of cases confirmed in patients who aren't on known contact lists threatens measures to contain the outbreak and undermines the effectiveness of the vaccine campaign, which depends on a ring-based strategy to vaccinate contacts of confirmed cases and their contacts.

Also, the WHO said recent cases from Beni include a disproportionate number of illnesses in children age 16 and younger. Of 70 cases reported since 1 Oct 2018, 30 (43%) involved children, 13 of them infants and kids younger than 5. The agency added that investigations are under way to identify the sources of infection in children and to interrupt transmission.

In another development, the WHO said Ebola was confirmed in a health worker from Beni on 20 Oct 2018, raising the total number of healthcare workers infected in the outbreak to 21, 20 of the cases confirmed. 3 health workers have died from their illnesses.

CDC director pushed to keep Ebola experts on-site
-------------------------------------------------
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield, MD, said he tried to make the case to keep US experts in the outbreak zone but was overruled by Trump administration officials due to security concerns, Stat reported today 23 Oct 2018.

According to earlier reports, the State Department recommended that the CDC experts be withdrawn, which occurred several weeks ago.

Redfield told Stat during the opening session of the Milken Institute Future of Health Summit that he believes health officials are at a disadvantage not having CDC expertise on the ground in the DRC and that he'd like to see a "small footprint of CDC employees there."

[Absence of CDC expertise is a big loss to the control effort, even with the other very excellent organizations still working in the DRC. The outbreak is verging on spinning out of control. Children are becoming infected at an alarming rate, 43% of 70 cases reported since 1 Oct 2018. Whether this is due to re-use of equipment is not clear (see ProMED-mail archive 20181023.6106210). Healthcare workers continue to become infected, now 21 cases with 3 deaths. The situation is dire.

Karl Johnson, a renowned virologist who, while at CDC Special Pathogens branch worked with the team who isolated and named Ebola virus in Zaire, has submitted the following opinion to ProMED:
"The struggle to control and eliminate this ongoing outbreak continues to go badly. It only awaits the initial case in neighboring Uganda for WHO to be forced to call for an International Health Crisis. It seems clear that money alone will not be useful; the ongoing civil war must be stopped, and it remains to be seen if the current world will decide to do that. We sadly await significant new developments, most of them not helpful in Ebola virus control."

The question remains, how does a country stop a civil war? - Mod.LK]

[3] Response
- Tue 23 Oct 2018. Vaccinations
[STAT news, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/23/ebola-response-teams-struggling-vaccine-tracking/
[Byline: Helen Branswell]

The Ebola response teams in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are having increasing trouble keeping track of where the virus is spreading, a problem that threatens containment efforts and undermines the effectiveness of the vaccination program there.

Public health officials had been hopeful that an experimental vaccine could help curb the spread of the outbreak. But, for that to happen, response teams must be able to identify people who have been in contact with Ebola patients. Persistent violence in the outbreak zone has made that hard to do.

More than half of the recently detected cases haven't been on lists of contacts. And even retrospective detective work is failing to piece some of these people into the transmission chain, the World Health Organization acknowledged.

"We have a number of indicators right now showing that our ability to quickly detect cases and follow up on their contacts has been seriously challenged by the safety issues," said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, who has been tracking the epidemic.

Vaccine, he said, "can't be given to people you don't know exist."

The severe insecurity problems in North Kivu, the province in northeastern DRC where Ebola is spreading, are throwing up major challenges for the outbreak response. There have been repeated attacks by rebel forces on Beni, the current Ebola hot spot, stymying efforts to track Ebola patients and their contacts.

The further behind the virus that the response teams get, the more difficult it will be to use the still-unlicensed vaccine, made by Merck, to its maximum effect, experts acknowledged.

The response team in North Kivu has vaccinated a prodigious number of people -- more than 20 000 so far in the province and in parts of neighboring Ituri province, where a few cases have occurred. That count rises by hundreds of people most days.

"It's extremely impressive," Anne Rimoin, an associate professor of infectious diseases epidemiology at UCLA's Fielding School of Public Health, told STAT.

But vaccination efforts were not conducted [Mon 22 Oct 2018] in Beni, after the weekend's violence there.

So far there have been 238 confirmed and probable cases reported in this outbreak and 155 deaths.

As gaps grow in the response team's understanding of where the virus is circulating and who has been exposed, the capacity of the vaccine to contain the outbreak diminishes. Osterholm explained the problem as if it were an equation.

Conventional Ebola control measures -- isolating the sick, identifying and monitoring the health of contacts of cases, and isolating them if they become symptomatic -- are variable A in the equation. On their own, these measures have contained decades of Ebola outbreaks in the past.

But then along came vaccine, variable B in the equation. The Merck vaccine was proved to work during the West African outbreak of 2014-2015 and was first used as a containment tool in an outbreak in western DRC this past spring. That outbreak was brought under control fairly rapidly.

A plus B should lead to containment of the outbreak, potentially faster than in outbreaks past. But if A falters, B -- the vaccine -- can't do the job on its own, Osterholm said. "It only works when you get it to the people who need it," he said.

That's because of ring vaccination, the type of vaccination strategy being deployed in North Kivu. It was used in the successful smallpox eradication campaign of the 1960s and 1970s.

The idea behind the strategy seems simple: Rather than trying to vaccinate everyone in a place where Ebola is spreading, focus on the people who are at risk of actually contracting the disease. Beni is a city of more than 200 000 people, but only a tiny fraction of them would have been exposed to the virus up to this point.

The goal is to throw up a wall of immunity that Ebola cannot scale.

But effective contact tracing is required to draw up the list of people who should be offered vaccine. And increasingly, contact tracing isn't identifying all of the at-risk people.

Since the beginning of October [2018], a period during which cases have surged, a growing proportion of new cases in Beni have come from outside the contact lists and can't be fitted into the chain of transmission, said Dr Peter Salama, the WHO's deputy director-general of emergency preparedness and response.

The contract tracing performance is measured in percentages -- the proportion of known contacts that are followed up daily. Ideally that figure should be in the mid-to-high 90s. And it has generally been that high elsewhere in North Kivu, said Salama.

But in Beni, it has been highly variable, he said, adding that after episodes of violence, the contact tracing performance at Beni has dipped to 30 percent or 40 percent.

The longer contact tracing flags, the more likely it is that the percentage of people being missed grows in an invisible fashion.

Rimoin, who has a long-standing research project in DRC, knows the difficulties the responders face. "The area in which this outbreak has emerged is a very difficult and complex place to have to do this work -- to do any work. But to have to combat Ebola in this area is mind-bogglingly difficult," she said.

Last week [week of 15 Oct 2018] a panel of international experts who reviewed the outbreak and the response to date suggested that the WHO consider adapting the vaccination strategy, moving to a more geographic approach -- vaccinating whole neighborhoods rather than just healthcare workers, contacts, and contacts of contacts.

Salama told STAT that approach comes with its own challenges. Merck has committed to maintaining a supply of 300 000 doses of the vaccine at all times and has been making additional vaccine as it ships doses to the DRC. So far in 2018, the company has shipped more than 32 000 doses of vaccine, said Pamela Eisele, a spokesperson for Merck.

While 300 000 doses seems like a substantial supply, Salama said he worried using the vaccine geographically could draw down the stockpile quickly. He noted the WHO has to also consider what might happen if this outbreak spreads into neighboring Uganda -- which is expected to soon start vaccinating health care workers in locations where cross-border cases might turn up -- or Rwanda or South Sudan.

Vaccinating all of Beni, for instance, would make a huge dent in the global stockpile, which would take time to replenished. "So obviously we have to just continue to ration it, according to the best evidence," he said.

Salama also said he is concerned a geographic approach to vaccination might not solve the underlying problem -- the fact that some people in the outbreak area continue to resist all of the control measures the responders use.

"If your high-risk contacts are actively avoiding follow-up, or vaccination, or care, they're going to avoid vaccination or geographic targeting strategy presumably as well," he said. "So you might end up thinking you've got great coverage geographically, but you've missed the same high-risk contacts that we're unable to follow up on now. So it will have very limited impact in that sense."

[The drop in contact tracing in Beni following episodes of violence to the low rate of 30 -- 40 percent contributes to the high level of activity in this location. As stated above, in Kivu the rates have approached 90%. It likely takes that level of immunity to successfully block spread of the virus, - Mod LK]

- Tue 23 Oct 2018. Ebola virus outbreak -- Beni: 25 traditional chiefs sensitized
[Digital Congo, Congolese Press Agency (ACP) report; in French, machine trans., abridged, edited]
https://www.digitalcongo.net/article/5bcf23eca6a2ad0004c49686/

On [Sat 20 Oct 2018], in Beni, 25 customary chiefs of the Alliance of Traditional Chiefs of the Democratic Republic of the Congo were sensitized in the fight against the epidemic of Ebola virus disease, says a statement from the Ministry of Health received [Mon 22 Oct 2018] at the ACP.

According to the source, the customary chiefs made the commitment to get involved in the interventions of the response, particularly in the management of resistance, the raising of alerts, and the notification of community deaths.

The Secretary-General of the Alliance of Traditional Leaders of the DRC, Mfumu Difima, said recently in Kinshasa, after a hearing by Minister of Health Oly Ilunga Kalenga, that it was important to use the traditional leaders in outreach and community engagement for their commitment to a perfect eradication of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in North Kivu and Ituri.

He relied on the various incidents that occurred in North Kivu province, which went against the response to EVD, including non-belief in the disease, tearing bodies off at burials, escapes of sick people from Ebola treatment centers (ETC).

Slowdown in community supervision on Sun 21 Oct 2018 in Beni
------------------------------------------------------------
The community-based monitoring activities were done by telephone with the focal points within the neighborhoods following the descent into the streets of Beni residents to express their dissatisfaction with the acts of violence that occurred in the area on Saturday evening [20 Oct 2018]. reports the source.
