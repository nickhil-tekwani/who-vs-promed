The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA) has modified the regions affected by the restrictions against bluetongue in the provinces of Salamanca, Ávila [Castile and Leon], and Toledo [Castile-La Mancha], due to the cases recently reported in the Oropesa region (Toledo) and in that of Ciudad Rodrigo (Salamanca).

Among the new regions included are those of Béjar and Guijuelo, in Salamanca; the regions of Candeleda, El Barco de Ávila, Piedrahita, Navarredonda de Gredos, Arenas de San Pedro, Navaluenga, El Barraco, Sotillo de la Adrada, and Cebreros, in the province of Ávila, as well as the province of Toledo.

Bluetongue is an acute viral disease of sheep, goats, and cattle, transmitted by hematophagous dipterans, with seasonal presentation and febrile course, characterized by hyperemic-hemorrhagic lesions in the buccal mucosa, hooves, and musculature, with the development of erosions and ulcerations.

[Spain is one of the EC member states in which certain zones have obtained 'bluetongue-free' status, allowing movements of the relevant animals (cattle, sheep, goats) to and from free zones in other member states. A map with the Member States and their respective status, presenting their respective infected and free zones, can be found at https://food.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-10/ad_control-measures_bt_restrictedzones-map_0.pdf. The map was last updated on 25 Oct 2022. BTV-4 is continuing its spread eastwards and northwards. A map of Spain's autonomous communities and provinces is available at https://www.nationsonline.org/maps/Spain-Administrative-Map.jpg

BTV-4, one of the 27 known serotypes of BTV, is considered highly pathogenic for susceptible sheep breeds. Cattle, on the other hand, are readily infected by the BTV vector (_Culicoides_ species) and undergo viraemia, but in most cases, with the exception of BTV-8 infection, without clinical disease.

According to recent unofficial information from Israel, a currently circulating BTV-4 strain has been causing clinical disease in dairy cattle as well. (https://hachaklait.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/45220000.pdf; in Hebrew, subscription required).

The bluetongue season in Spain is expected to terminate when temperatures drop. - Mod.AS
