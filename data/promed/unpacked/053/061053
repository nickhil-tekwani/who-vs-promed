As reported by the Territorial management of the Russian (Health)
Protection Agency (Rospotrebnadzor) in Moscow, Q fever, a rare disease, was
not diagnosed in Moscow in 2004. In 2005, Q fever has already been
diagnosed in 5 persons. All of them worked in the Peter Alekseev weaving mill.
The 1st person fell ill in the spring of 2005, the 2nd person in the
summer, and now 3 more persons with similar symptoms, high fever and a
headache -- have been hospitalized in the autumn of 2005. The reason for
the human infection is thought to be contaminated sheep's wool. Both
carders and spinners worked with the wool.

[The method of diagnosis of Q fever here is not stated.
Carding wool can be done by hand or machine. Either way the "cards"
contain small metallic "needles" that by being pulled over the wool will
help separate wool fibers. The fibers are then rolled into a slender tube
called a rolag and from there the material can be spun into wool for knitting.
Q fever was first described in Australia: it was called "Query fever"
because the causative agent was initially unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the
causative agent, was discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can
be resistant to heat and desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol
route. A single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in
primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was found to be 1.7
organisms(1).
Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including
other species of livestock and in domesticated pets. _C.burnetii_ does not
usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion in goats
and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection. Organisms are
excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals. Most importantly,
during birthing the organisms are shed in high numbers within the amniotic
fluids and the placenta. Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a
mode of transmission (2).
The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long
periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is
associated with compact small cell variants of the organism that are
produced during standard replication along with the less resistant large
cell form and metabolically dormant and spore-like (3). The Q fever
organism is a Category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact, although not
thought to be bioterrorism related, was spread by mail in a post office in
the UK in 1987 (4).
Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms from
air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried placental
material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd animals. Humans are
often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be
required to cause infection.
Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and inspiration
of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of transmission. Other
modes of transmission to humans, including tick bites and human to human
transmission, are rare.
