Hong Kong authorities said a girl in the city developed a kidney
stone after drinking Chinese milk containing the industrial chemical
melamine, the 1st known illness outside mainland China linked to a
spate of contaminations.

Doctors found a stone in the 3-year-old's left kidney when her
parents took her for a checkup after learning the milk she'd been
drinking for 15 months, made by Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group
Co., may contain melamine, Hong Kong's Department of Health said in a
statement yesterday [20 Sep 2008].

At least 4 children have died after consuming milk powder, liquid
milk or yogurt containing melamine, a compound used in making
plastics and tanning leather. The number reported hospitalized from
milk powder increased almost 9-fold to 12 892, with 104 in a serious
condition, the official China Central Television said on its nightly
news broadcast today. Hong Kong authorities have asked the city's
doctors to report all cases of kidney illness suspected of being
connected with the tainted milk.

China and Hong Kong have set up hotlines for distributing medical
information to concerned parents and recalled milk products that
tests show may contain melamine. China's State Administration of
Industry and Commerce had paid refunds for 304 tons of dairy products
as of 9 a.m. yesterday, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
In China, 39 965 children have visited clinics after falling ill from
the powder, CCTV said today [21 Sep 2008].

The Hong Kong girl, who wasn't identified, had been drinking as many
as 3 cups a day of a high-calcium, low-fat Yili milk, the health
department's statement said. She has been treated and discharged, it said.

China's milk-contamination scandal was exposed on [11 Sep 2008] when
the Beijing-based Ministry of Health said it found melamine in baby
formula made by Sanlu Group Co., a domestic producer that's 43
percent owned by Auckland, New Zealand-based Fonterra Cooperative
Group Ltd. It's since widened to include 21 other Chinese dairy
producers after tests found the chemical in 69 batches of formula and
24 batches of liquid milk and yogurt.

Most of the hospitalizations to date were caused by Sanlu products,
CCTV reported today [21 Sep 2008], citing Ministry of Health
statistics, without being more specific. There have been no reported
cases of sickness caused by drinking liquid milk, CCTV said.

China's 3 biggest dairy producers by market value -- Yili, China
Mengniu Dairy Co. and Bright Dairy & Food Co. -- are among companies
whose products contain melamine, according to the government.

Plunging consumer confidence and increased spending on quality
control in the aftermath of the scandal will erode earnings of
Chinese dairy companies, said UBS AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Surging
costs and government caps on price increases had already crimped
profit margins.

China's dairy market was expected to expand to USD 20 billion this
year [2008], from USD 18 billion in 2007, Euromonitor forecast before
the melamine scandal.

China's latest quality-control scandal may also further erode global
confidence in exports the world's most-populous country depends on to
help generate 10 million jobs a year. The nation's manufacturers are
already grappling with reduced demand from their biggest overseas
customers as growth slows in Japan, the U.S. and Europe.

Taiwan's Department of Health today [21 Sep 2008] ordered King Car
Food Co. to recall 8 of its products, including instant coffee and
soup, that were made in Taiwan with mainland Chinese dairy
ingredients. The company this morning notified Taiwan authorities
that the products contained melamine, the health department's statement said.

The U.S. is testing food, milk and milk-derived products including
whey powder that may contain ingredients from China, the Food and
Drug Administration said in a statement yesterday [20 Sep 2008]. The
administration will also step up inspection at ports of entry to keep
out tainted milk products, the Associated Press reported.

China yesterday [20 Sep 2008] ordered widespread inspections of dairy
companies and promised to punish anyone responsible. Companies will
bear the costs of recalls and medical treatment for ailments caused
by their products, the statement by the State Council said.

China's Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and
Quarantine is conducting inspections for melamine at 1548 dairy
companies, according to CCTV. Mengniu, Yili and Bright Dairy have
issued statements apologizing to customers and pledging to step up
quality controls.

Suppliers of milk to the dairy companies sought to cut costs by
diluting milk and then adding melamine, which makes the protein
content appear artificially higher. Investigations showed that as
many as 372 milk stations supplying Sanlu had been adding the
chemical since as early as April 2005, Yang Chongyong, deputy
governor of Hebei province where Sanlu is based, said on [17 Sep 2008].

New Zealand authorities took 3 weeks to notify China's central
government after learning from Fonterra on [14 Aug 2008] that its
Chinese partner Sanlu may be using tainted milk, the New Zealand
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday [20 Sep 2008].

New Zealand relayed the news to China on [9 Sep 2008]. China
announced a probe on [10 Sep 2008], and the next day [11 Sep 2008]
the Chinese Ministry of Health said milk powder made by Sanlu may
cause kidney stones in infants.

Fonterra Chief Executive Officer Andrew Ferrier last week said local
officials in Hebei took too long to issue a public warning of the
contamination.

[The above newswire presents the 1st report of problems outside of
mainland China associated with the ingestion of melamine-contaminated
milk products. It also mentions a significant increase in the numbers
of identified affected children in China -- now 12 892 compared with
"more than 6240" reported in the WHO update on 19 Sep 2008 (see
PRO/MBDS posting, Infant kidney stones - China (04): WHO,
international recall 20080919.2948 or ProMED-mail posting, Infant
kidney stones - China (04): WHO, international recall 20080919.2951).
With the current increased investigation into presence of the
contaminated product in other international markets (see additional
reports below), it would not be surprising to learn of additional
cases being identified in other countries that imported these milk
powder products.

The above mentioned time-line does not fully match information from
other newswires and announcements. The 1st posting carried on this
topic by PRO/MBDS and ProMED-mail was on 10 Sep 2008 and had
newswires from 10 Sep 2008 and 9 Sep 2008 mentioning the clustering
of kidney stones in infants using one particular milk producer's
product in Gansu Province (see PRO/MBDS posting Infant kidney stones
- China: Gansu, milk powder susp., RFI 20080910.2827 and ProMED-mail
posting Infant kidney stones - China: Gansu, milk powder susp., RFI
20080910.2828).

In an editorial from the New Zealand Herald published today (21 Sep
2008), there is mention that Fontera learned of the contamination on
2 Aug 2008 but did not disclose this information until 11 Sep 2008,
whereas the dates given in the above article include knowledge of the
problem by Fontera on 14 Aug 2008 and notification on 9 Sep 2008 (see
article at:
<http://www.nzherald.co.nz/food/news/article.cfm?c_id=206&objectid=10533356>).

The intriguing tidbit in the above newswire is the mention that San
Lu -- one of the key milk powder producers implicated in this current
scandal related to melamine contamination of milk powder -- mentioned
this practice dates back to April 2005. "Investigations showed that
as many as 372 milk stations supplying Sanlu had been adding the
chemical since as early as April 2005, Yang Chongyong, deputy
governor of Hebei province, where Sanlu is based, said on [17 Sep
2008]." In a retrospective search of information available on the
internet related to milk contamination in China, there was a newswire
dated 9 May 2007 related to the melamine contamination of pet food
that mentioned that other products were tested, including milk
powder, and were found to be free of melamine (see article at:
<http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/2007-05-09-petfood-managers-detained_N.htm>).

PRO/MBDS (and ProMED-mail) would be very interested to learn whether
any of our subscribers had information on the occurrence of kidney
stones in infants in China related to this melamine contamination of
milk products before the PRO/MBDS and ProMED-mail postings on 10 Sep
2008, perhaps from internet-based chat rooms in China. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Taiwan - melamine identified in milk products
Date: 19 Sep 2008
From: Eva Tseng <ev.tseng@gmail.com>

In today's post about infant kidney stones in China (see PRO/MBDS
posting, Infant kidney stones - China (04): WHO, international recall
20080919.2948 or ProMED-mail posting, Infant kidney stones - China
(04): WHO, international recall 20080919.2951), there was a comment
at the end that Chinese authorities have reported that only 5
countries have imported the contaminated baby milk. However, I just
wanted to point out that, in fact, 25 tons of contaminated Sanlu milk
powder were imported to Taiwan. Below are news articles about the
Taiwan Department of Health's efforts to track down and destroy all the powder:

[3] Melamine identified in liquid milk
Date: 20 Sep 2008

The scandal that was 1st confined to baby milk formula has spread to
liquid milk in China.

Tests show 10 percent of the liquid milk supply has been contaminated
with melamine, the chemical that has killed 4 infants and left
thousands more ill.

In New Zealand, food safety investigators are taking no chances. They
are now testing Chinese dairy products including milk, tea and yoghurt.

"There is a small risk that there is contaminated product [moving]
into the country, and that's why we are looking at as many as we
can," says Sandra Daly, of the Food Safety Authority.

In China, 6000 babies are ill, and more than 20 companies are accused
of selling products tainted with melamine.

The only coffee Starbucks is making right now in China is made with
soy, as the scandal spreads to everyday drinking milk.

China has been plagued with problems in the food and drug industry.
In 2004, 13 children died from malnutrition from fake milk powder.

Last year [2007], thousands of Chinese-made toys were recalled after
being contaminated with lead paint.

The food and drug regulator was executed for accepting bribes.

Every day this week, a new product is being taken off the shelves,
leaving the Chinese to find a product they can trust and generating
world-wide distrust in Chinese goods.

[4] Burundi - ban on Chinese milk products
Date: 21 Sep 2008

Burundi became the 3rd African nation to ban Chinese milk products,
after tainted milk from the country killed 4 babies in China and made
thousands of others ill, the government said Sunday [21 Sep 2008].

"The trade, industry and tourism ministry is calling on importers and
shopkeepers who stock Chinese milk to stop selling the product until
the end of an investigation," a ministry statement said.

"This measure also concerns the sellers of repackaged milk, whatever
its origin," added the statement, while urging consumers to keep a
watchful eye on the packaging of milk products.

A special commission has been set up to investigate the scale of the
tainted milk problem in Burundi and "take urgent measures to protect
the population," the statement said.

Burundi imports milk products from 2 Chinese companies that are
currently embroiled in the tainted powdered-milk scandal.

Four children have died, and at least 6200 are ill owing to milk
products contaminated with melamine, an industrial chemical used in
the manufacturing of plastics.

A Burundi consumer association, known as ABUCO, expressed concern
that tainted milk products were already being stocked in the country's shops.

"For the moment, nobody knows if the milk is being sold on the
Burundi market," said Noel Nkurunziza, the president of ABUCO.

On Saturday [20 Sep 2008], Gabon and Tanzania banned Chinese milk
products and all Chinese dairy products.

[Burundi and Gabon were 2 of the 5 countries mentioned to be
importers of milk powder containing products made by companies
presently implicated in the contamination of milk products. The other
3 countries mentioned by the Chinese as importers of these products
are Bangladesh, Myanmar and Yemen. From the myriad newswires on this
current topic, it appears as though there are many more products made
from the milk powder that are potentially contaminated with melamine
that have been distributed in the international market. As mentioned
in [2] above, Taiwan has identified melamine in some of the imported
milk products. Bangladesh and Myanmar have banned further imports and
are initiating recalls of products containing Chinese produced milk
powder. - Mod.MPP]
