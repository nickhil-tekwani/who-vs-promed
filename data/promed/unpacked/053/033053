AVIAN INFLUENZA - USA (PENNSYLVANIA)(07)
****************************************
A ProMED-mail post
[WE DEEPLY REGRET THE DELAY IN THIS POST -- see date of receipt below --
due to my oversight, particularly because it contains important
information about the low probability of humans contracting avian flu
directly from birds. The report of the Hong Kong case of avian flu in a
child came after the date of Michael's comments below - Mod.JW]

Regarding the recent post [excerpted from FSNET] referring to a possible
risk posed by pigeons used in some sort of recreational shooting event in
Pennsylvania, I have a few comments:
1) First and foremost: these comments are my own and in no way reflect
USDA's attitudes or policy toward anything related to what was described in
the original post.
2) The outbreak strains of AI in Pennsylvania and isolations of H7 subtype
viruses in the northeast US have all been non-pathogenic in the laboratory
and by sequence analysis. There have been a variety of signs described
associated with the presence of the virus, but as far as I know only mild
respiratory signs have been noted. If anyone knows differently, I would
very much like to know!
3) The quarantine has been lifted and surrounding areas are currently AI
free by serology. Again anyone with different information please respond.
4) I am not aware of ANY pigeon isolates of AI and indeed the post said no
AI strains were isolated ..... so why were the pigeon shoot and AI linked?
The best evidence of introductions of AI from nature are the studies over
the years linking migratory waterfowl and introduction into commercial
poultry operations, live bird markets and backyard flocks. If you are
worried about 5000 pigeons, you should be catatonic over the number of
migratory waterfowl in Pennsylvania!
5) There are only 2 instances of transmission of avian influenza viruses
to humans. The most recent and perhaps somewhat troubling one was a report
of conjunctivitis in a woman reported by Kurtz et. al. 1996, Lancet 348:
901-902. This strain was a non-pathogenic H7 and apparently was 100%
avian. I will, however, report that in 30 years of work at the labs here,
working with virtually all of the H7 strains available, both High and Low
pathogenicity, no staff member has ever experienced an infection and no one
has ever seroconverted. This has been in every conceivable situation (e.g.
using concentrated purified virus, and having dying birds cough in one's
face).
6) I think there was a little bit (or more) of sensationalism associated
with this post. To associate what someone feels are improper conditions at
a pigeon shoot with "putting at risk the health of all Pennsylvanians" is a
bit much. I won't comment on
the other diseases referred to in the post. I, as much as anyone, would
like to see significant attention paid to avian influenza, but not for the
reasons outlined in the posting.

[My thanks to Dr. Perdue for critiquing the previous posting and
providing the information shown above. The references to avian
influenza in the previous posting were not scientifically linked to any
occurrence of AI in pigeons or to any known spread of AI by pigeons.
There are general public health concerns related to pigeons
(salmonellosis, chlamydiosis, etc.) but none associating pigeons with AI
