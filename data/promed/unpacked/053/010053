In its weekly snapshot of the pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) said yesterday [20 Apr 2022] that global cases dropped for the 4th straight week, with illness levels -- as well as deaths -- down in all regions (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/weekly-epidemiological-update-on-covid-19---20-april-2022).

In US developments, new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show a drop in routine (non-COVID) childhood vaccination rates in kindergarteners, due to COVID-19 disruptions, as the nation's cases inch upward again.

About 5 million cases were reported last week, a drop of 24% compared to the week before, putting the world at the level it was in the middle of December [2021], before the height of the omicron variant surge, which was the biggest of the pandemic. The 5 countries that reported the most cases were South Korea, France, Germany, Italy, and Japan.

The WHO has urged people to interpret the trends with caution, however, given that countries are stepping down some of their testing strategies, which would likely influence case counts. Countries reported about 18 000 COVID-19 deaths, reflecting a decrease of 12%. The United States reported the most, followed by Russia, South Korea, Germany, and Italy.

Though cases declined in all of the world's regions, a few countries reported increases over the last week. In Africa, cases were up sharply in Niger, Mozambique, and Zambia. In the Americas, cases were up in Suriname, Haiti, Saint Lucia, and the United States. In the European region, cases were up in Kyrgyzstan and Andorra. And in Asia, Guam and China reported case rises.

In China, a lockdown will continue in Shanghai -- even in districts with no cases -- due to persistent infections outside of quarantine settings, officials said today [21 Apr 2022] at a briefing, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/shanghai-says-its-lockdown-will-only-be-lifted-batches-2022-04-22/). The city's 26 million people are in their 4th week of lockdown, which has affected global supply chains and has been a drag on China's economy.

China today [21 Apr 2022] reported 19 382 new local cases, of which 16 552 were asymptomatic. Of the symptomatic cases, 93% were from Shanghai, and of the asymptomatic infections, 95% were from Shanghai. Also today China reported 8 more deaths, all in Shanghai.

Elsewhere in the region, Taiwan -- where a surge recently began -- reported 3058 new cases today [21 Apr 2022], according to CNA [Central News Agency]. Only 6 patients, though, so far have moderate infections, with the rest mild or asymptomatic. Officials have said cases aren't yet at peak levels, which could reach 10 000 a day (https://focustaiwan.tw/society/202204210008).

Hong Kong, where cases are steadily declining after its worst surge, has reopened beauty parlors, theme parks, and movie theaters for the 1st time in 4 months, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2MD059).

In US news, rates of routine childhood vaccines for incoming kindergarteners during the 2021-22 school year dropped to 94%, according to new data today [21 Apr 2022] from the CDC. The CDC said the drop is another outcome of disrupted medical care caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

"There are 35 000 more children in the United States during this time period without documentation of complete vaccination against common diseases," Georgina Peacock, MD, the acting director of the CDC's immunization services division, said today during a press conference. The target 95% threshold was not met for the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine or for the diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine.

In other school-related news, Milwaukee Public Schools reinstated its district-wide mask mandate on 19 Apr 2022, just one day after making masks optional, ABC News reports. District officials cited significant transmission of COVID-19 in the city as the reason for the mandate returning (https://abcnews.go.com/Health/milwaukee-schools-reinstate-mask-mandate-day-dropped/story?id=84188109).

COVID-19 cases continue to climb across the country. The United States reported 68 781 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [20 Apr 2022] and 877 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 43 357, with 386 daily deaths, according to The New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).

[2] Monoclonal antibody Evusheld
Date: Thu 21 Apr 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/04/astrazenecas-evusheld-slashes-risk-symptomatic-covid-19-83


AstraZeneca's monoclonal antibody combination tixagevimab-cilgavimab (Evusheld) reduced the risk of symptomatic COVID-19 infection by 83% over placebo at a median follow-up of 6 months, finds a phase 3 randomized clinical trial published yesterday [20 Apr 2022] in the New England Journal of Medicine (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116620 [see comment below. - Mod.LK]).

As part of an ongoing trial, US and European PROVENT Study Group members, which included AstraZeneca representatives, enrolled 5197 COVID-naïve adults at elevated risk for inadequate immune response to COVID-19 vaccination and/or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at 87 sites from 21 Nov 2020 to 22 Mar 2021, before the rise of the delta and omicron variants.

The researchers randomly assigned participants in a 2:1 ratio to receive one intramuscular 300-milligram dose of either Evusheld (3460) or a saline placebo (1737) and contacted them weekly about any COVID-19 symptoms for up to 183 days.

Over 73% of participants were at elevated risk of infection owing to age older than 60, obesity, impaired immunity, or a high risk for vaccine-related adverse events, and 77.5% had congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or chronic kidney or liver disease.

Among Evusheld recipients, 1161 (34%) were vaccinated against COVID-19, as were 853 (49%) in the placebo group. Average age was 53.5 years, 43.4% were age 60 or older, 46.1% were women, 14.5% were Hispanic, 17.3% were Black, and 73.0% were White.

Of all participants, 52.5% were considered at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, including healthcare workers, meatpackers, military personnel, students living in dorms, and others living closely together in Belgium, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Symptomatic COVID-19 infection occurred in 0.2% of 3460 Evusheld recipients, compared with 1.0% of 1731 placebo recipients (relative risk reduction, 76.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 46.0%-90.0%). After a median of 6 months, the relative risk reduction was 82.8% (95% CI, 65.8%-91.4%).

"This increase in the efficacy estimate since the time of the primary analysis was driven by a greater percentage of events in the placebo group (1.2%, in 12 of 960 participants) than in the AZD7442 [Evusheld] group (0.1%, in 3 of 2003 participants) during months 3 through 6, as compared with months 0 through 3," the researchers wrote.

Among participants at increased risk for COVID-19 infection or exposure, relative risk reductions (80.7% and 82.6%, respectively) were comparable to that in the overall population in the primary efficacy analysis (76.7%). Time to symptom onset was longer with Evusheld than placebo (hazard ratio, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.08-0.33). Serum concentrations of Evusheld remained high for 6 months after receipt.

Five participants, all in the placebo group, developed severe or critical COVID-19, and 2 died of COVID-19. Six Evusheld recipients (0.2%) and no placebo recipients visited an emergency department with symptoms consistent with COVID-19; 3 of them later tested positive for COVID-19, but none were admitted to the hospital.

Among the 3460 Evusheld recipients, 35.3% reported at least one adverse event, most mild or moderate, compared with 34.2% of 1736 placebo recipients. The most common adverse event was a reaction at the injection site, which occurred in 2.4% in the Evusheld group and 2.1% of placebo recipients.

Viral genotypic data for 7 of 11 symptomatic Evusheld recipients and 13 of 31 symptomatic placebo recipients showed that one in the Evusheld group was infected with the beta variant and 5 each in the placebo group had an alpha subvariant or delta infection.

The study authors noted that a previous phase 1 trial of Evusheld compared with serum from COVID-19 survivors, Evusheld recipients had higher SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody levels, which remained 3 times as high after 9 months. Those findings were published in January [2022] (https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scitranslmed.abl8124).

"The data reported here provide support for the use of AZD7442 as immunoprophylaxis to prevent COVID-19," they wrote, adding that Evusheld has the advantage over other monoclonal antibodies because it offers relatively long-lasting protection against infection, is given intramuscularly rather than intravenously, and is administered only once as 2 shots rather than monthly. Clinical and pharmacokinetic evaluations of Evusheld in this trial are expected to continue for at least a year, the researchers said.

In December 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Evusheld to prevent COVID-19 in people with moderately to severely impaired immunity and those in whom vaccination is not recommended. On 24 Feb 2022, the FDA recommended increasing the dose to 600 mg owing to the emergence of the omicron BA.1 subvariant.

[Conclusions from the New England Journal of Medicine article cited above (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2116620): "A single dose of AZD7442 had efficacy for the prevention of COVID-19, without evident safety concerns."

AZD7442 is a combination of 2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), AZD8895 (tixagevimab) and AZD1061 (cilgavimab), that simultaneously bind to distinct, nonoverlapping epitopes on the spike protein receptor binding domain to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The 2 mAbs are derived from antibodies isolated from B cells obtained from persons infected with SARS-CoV-2. - Mod.LK]

[3] Sequential infection and antibiotic use
[A] Spain: omicron on heels of delta infection
Date: Thu 21 Apr 2022

A 31-year-old woman from Spain contracted COVID-19 twice within 3 weeks, despite being fully vaccinated and recently receiving a booster shot, according to a case report that will be presented at the upcoming European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) meeting (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/950144; ECCMID 2022, Lisbon, 23-26 Apr 2022). The case provides evidence that the omicron strain is able to evade previous immunity.

The woman, a healthcare worker, first tested positive in December 2021 -- 12 days after receiving a booster dose of vaccine -- during screening at work. She had no symptoms and isolated for 10 days. On 10 Jan 2022, 20 days after her 1st positive test, she tested positive again after developing fever and a cough.

The 20-day gap between infections is the shortest recorded. Whole-genome sequencing showed the 1st infection was caused by the delta strain, and the 2nd, omicron.

"This case highlights the potential of the omicron variant to evade the previous immunity acquired either from a natural infection with other variants or from vaccines," said Gemma Recio, MD, of the Institut Cataa de Salut in Tarragona, Spain, in a press release. "In other words, people who have had COVID-19 cannot assume they are protected against reinfection, even if they have been fully vaccinated."

[Also see this report from The Guardian (https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/21/woman-31-catches-covid-twice-within-21-days-spain):

"A 31-year-old woman in Spain caught COVID twice within 20 days, the shortest known gap between infections, scientists have reported. Researchers in Spain gave details of the healthcare worker, who tested positive a few days before Christmas in December 2021 and again in January 2022. The case is further evidence that the omicron variant can evade immunity from even recent previous infections.

"The woman, who was fully vaccinated and had received a booster shot 12 days earlier, tested positive in a PCR staff screening test at work on 20 Dec 2021. She didn't develop any symptoms, and self-isolated for 10 days before returning to work.

"On 10 Jan 2022, just 20 days after first testing positive, she developed a cough, fever and felt generally unwell and did another PCR test. This was also positive.

"Whole genome sequencing showed that the patient had been infected by 2 different COVID variants. Her 1st infection was with the delta variant and the 2nd was with the omicron variant, which is known to be more infectious and can evade immunity from past infections and vaccination.

"Dr Gemma Recio, of the Institut Català de la Salut in Tarragona and one of the study's authors, said: 'This case highlights the potential of the omicron variant to evade the previous immunity acquired either from a natural infection with other variants or from vaccines.' She added that the case underlined the importance of genomic surveillance. 'Such monitoring will help detect variants with the ability to partially evade the immune response,' she said.

"Reinfections are recorded in the UK, but require 90 days between positive tests. Official figures suggest that nearly 900 000 people in England had potentially been infected twice with COVID up to the start of April [2022]. However, the number is not exact because only whole-genome sequencing can pinpoint whether infections are caused by different variants, and not all infections are reported.

"Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: 'This case is not particularly surprising, though the gap between infections is particularly short. We have known for some months that reinfections will occur. The omicron variant with its escape mutations has made reinfections even more likely.'

"Now that omicron is the dominant variant, it is possible that prior infection with omicron will make reinfection -- especially so quickly -- less likely. Previously scientists had predicted that as COVID-19 moves into an endemic phase, reinfections are likely to occur within a range of 3 months to 5 years.

"'We can expect further waves of infection especially during winter even without new variants,' said Hunter. 'Fortunately the evidence is that immunity to severe disease is more robust than immunity to infection. So even though reinfections will continue to occur for many years, we will see fewer and fewer severe illnesses and deaths with time.'

"Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist at the University of Warwick, said: 'While it is difficult to extrapolate from a single case, this report highlights the ability of the omicron variant, and its sub-variants, to reinfect even in those individuals who are fully vaccinated.... This accounts for the extremely high levels of infection we have experienced in the UK.'" Thanks to Roland Hübner for the link. - Mod.LK]

[B] Australia: antibiotic use falls
Date: Thu 21 Apr 2022
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/04/news-scan-apr-21-2022


Data being presented at this month's European Congress of Clinical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases (ECCMID) meeting and published in Clinical Infectious Diseases reveal that antibiotics prescribed in Australia fell 23%-38% during COVID-19 (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/950147, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciac277).

Australian researchers analyzed a representative sample of 10% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions issued from January 2014 to April 2021. They found that, before 2020, antibiotic prescribing was 29% higher on average during the winter months of June, July, and August than during the summer months of December, January, and February.

That seasonal variation, however, disappeared during the pandemic. In winter 2020, practitioners prescribed 38% fewer antibiotics than in the winters of 2018 and 2019 (1 432 000 prescriptions per month vs 2 313 000). Summer 2021 showed a 23% reduction in prescriptions compared with the summers of 2018 and 2019 (1 374 000 per month vs 1 817 000).

Reductions were predominantly in antibiotics used to treat community-acquired respiratory infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis. For example, amoxicillin prescriptions fell 52% in the winter and 23% in summer. In a similar vein, prescriptions for amoxicillin-clavulanate followed a similar pattern: down 51% in the winter and 37% in the summer.

Decreases in antibiotic prescriptions were observed across all age-groups, with the greatest change in children, who saw a 52% decrease in winter and a 24% drop in summer. Further assessment revealed that 84% of winter and 97% of summer declines were driven by reductions in prescribing among general practitioners.

First author Jack Skeggs, MBBS, said in an ECCMID press release, "Existing community antimicrobial stewardship programmes, community education related to personal hygiene and handwashing, culture shifts in mask wearing and social distancing, and, possibly, reduced prescribing for viral syndromes may all play a role.

"However, the finding that significant reductions existed in states without high [COVID-19] case numbers or lockdowns is promising and suggests that we may be able to maintain at least some of these decreases after the pandemic by encouraging these same culture shifts."

The South Asia COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 22 Apr 2022 at 06:58 GMT:
Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 43 052 425 / 522 116 / 372
Bangladesh: 1 952 485 / 29 127 / 174

Maldives: 178 883 / 298 / 535
Afghanistan: 178 611 / 7680 / 190
Bhutan: 56 301 / 19 / 24

Over the last 7 days, 12 453, 288, 717, 71, and 266 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 6905, 250, 718, 89, and 350 in the preceding 7 days, revealing a sharp increasing trend in India, a state of almost stability in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Nepal, and the continuation of the decreasing trend in Sri Lanka.

By the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the Maldives has recently overtaken Afghanistan in South Asia.

The trends of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths attributed to the disease in Pakistan can be seen at https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/pk.

In the last 7 days, the total number of people who died due to COVID-19 was 344 in India, 3 in Bangladesh, 6 in Pakistan, and 4 in Sri Lanka, but no one has died from the disease over the last 5 weeks or so in Nepal. Over the last 24 hours as of 22 Apr 2022 at 08:00 IST, COVID-19 deaths were reported from one union territory and 6 states of the 36 states and union territories in India -- 1 each in Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Punjab, and Uttarakhand, but 48 in Kerala (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

India has recently reported the presence of the XE variant (a recombinant of omicron BA.1 and BA.2) of the virus in 2 patients (https://vervetimes.com/corona-virus-news-update-second-case-found-of-xe-variant-in-mumbai-positive-patient-took-both-doses-of-vaccine-mhpv/). It is still premature to comment whether this variant would initiate another wave of COVID-19 in India, and subsequently in other South Asian countries. However, the recent sharp increase of new cases in the country is alarming. The authorities concerned in the country should take necessary preemptive measures to curb the potential spread of the variant.

As of 22 Apr 2022, at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 872 626 515 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 70% of the population. As of 20 Apr 2022, 107.74% have received the 1st dose and 97.14% of the target population have received the 1st and 2nd doses. Around 10.15% of the target population have also received a 3rd dose as a booster vaccination (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).
