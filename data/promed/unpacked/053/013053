Amid mounting fears over the havoc the 3rd wave of COVID-19 may have caused across the state, an old problem has reared its head again in Shivamogga. A 57 year old woman in Kudige village of Thirthahalli has been admitted to the taluk hospital with Kyasanur Forest disease [KFD], the 1st case since 2019.

The patient had been suffering from fever for a few days, following which her blood sample was collected and tested for KFD. The health department decided to have her samples tested for KFD since Kudige, nestled amid dense forests, is situated in the zone where the disease has been rampant.

The woman was initially admitted to Thirthahalli taluk hospital, before she was shifted to Manipal in the evening on Friday [21 Jan 2022]. Shivamogga district health officer Dr Rajesh Suragihalli told TOI, "The woman's symptoms are mild. There is no cause for worry. Of the 50 samples tested for KFD, one has been confirmed. The woman in question had taken a vaccine against the disease."

In December 2019, Aralagodu in Sagar taluk was affected by KFD, which claimed 22 lives. In all, 26 people succumbed in 2 years in Shivamogga. However, in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, the KFD graph tapered to zero. Meanwhile, a team from National Institute of Virology (NIV) visited Aralagodu village to collect ticks, the insects that spread KFD. Officials said a report is yet to be submitted to the government.

Since it was first reported in 1957 at Kyasanur village in Soraba taluk, the virus has undergone multiple mutations. Dr Suragihalli said the health department is monitoring the mutating ticks. "We have surveyed villages previously affected, and of the 300 ticks we have collected and tested, 3 were found to have KFD [virus]. We have requested villagers to be as careful as possible, and [inform] us about the death of monkeys," he added.

["Hard ticks (_Hemaphysalis spinigera_) are the reservoir of KFD virus and once infected, remain so for life. Rodents, shrews, and monkeys are common hosts for KFDV after being bitten by an infected tick. KFDV can cause epizootics with high fatality in primates.

"Transmission to humans may occur after a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, most importantly a sick or recently dead monkey. No person-to-person transmission has been described.

"There is no specific treatment for KFD, but early hospitalization and supportive therapy is important. Supportive therapy includes the maintenance of hydration and the usual precautions for patients with [hemorrhagic symptoms].

"A vaccine is available for KFD and is used in endemic areas of India. Additional preventative measures include insect repellents and wearing protective clothing in areas where ticks are endemic."

"Shimoga district, officially known as Shivamogga district, is a district in the Karnataka state of India."
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimoga_district)

The district was considered a hotspot for Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), also referred to as monkey fever, caused by Kyasanur Forest disease virus. To contain the disease in the district, where fatalities attributed to the disease were intermittently recorded in the past, mass vaccination was conducted (see https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/260919/shivamogga-launches-drive-to-fight-kyasanur-forest-disease.html).

Because of the vaccination initiative, the disease could have been under control until this reported case, which may be a sporadic event. The case had a past history of KFD vaccination and is reportedly experiencing mild clinical symptoms. The detection of a new case again indicates the need for epidemiological monitoring and possible need for vaccination to protect the at-risk population.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to control its spread present new challenges for public health officials in responding to existing infectious disease outbreaks and poses a risk of increased incidence and/or under-reporting of other diseases. - Mod.UBA
