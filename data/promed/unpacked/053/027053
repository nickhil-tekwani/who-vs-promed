[Newcastle disease (NCD) has been occurring in Israel for several years. As an OIE Member country Israel has been reporting Newcastle disease both as immediate notification and follow up reports, as well as in the 6-monthly reports. The WAHID disease time series analysis shows that between January 2011 and September 2013, 184 outbreaks were reported to the OIE: 110 outbreaks in 2011, 56 in 2012, and 18 in 2013 to date. Outbreaks peak during the months of November to April.

Details of each outbreak can be found at the WAHID database http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Diseasetimeseries and http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary
(Note: to view the information on NCD, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease). - Mod.CRD]

[NCD has a characteristic seasonal pattern in Israel, peaking during the winter months (November-April). During the years 1972-2010, the lowest number of outbreaks was recorded in September. A significant decrease in the incidence of NCD in Israel has been recorded during the winter 2012/2013, compared to the previous 2 years. - Mod.AS]

[Recent and historical data show that NCD has been endemic in Israel for many years. Although the disease clearly shows a seasonal pattern, its continual yearly occurrence supports an endemic status for the country, and Israel may want to consider reporting the disease only in its 6-month and annual reports rather than as an immediate notification.

A report provided by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Veterinary & Science Policy Advice International Disease Monitoring on Newcastle Disease in Europe (DEFRA-IDM) indicates that "Samples from both the Bulgarian and Cypriot outbreaks were sent to the International Reference Laboratory for Newcastle Disease, AHVLA-Weybridge and sequence analysis identified lineage 5a viruses. All the 5a viruses from Turkey, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Israel are closely related."

This DEFRA-IDM report includes a map showing the outbreaks in Bulgaria and Cyprus as well as recent outbreaks from neighbouring regions. Turkey and Israel are regularly reporting outbreaks, with those in Turkey occurring mostly in backyard flocks, while those in Israel occurring in commercial flocks where vaccination against NCD is compulsory (http://www.defra.gov.uk/animal-diseases/files/poa-newcastle-disease-20130712.pdf). - Mod.CRD
