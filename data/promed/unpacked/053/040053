[As anticipated, the FMD virus circulating in Algeria has been confirmed to be of serotype O, similar to the one in Tunisia from where, reportedly, the disease spread to Algeria. Though genotyping of the Algerian isolate is not (yet) available, it will be safe to assume that the Tunisian strain, genotyped FMDV "O/ME-SA/Ind-2001 lineage," is circulating in both countries. This strain is known to have spread in recent years from the Indian sub-continent into West Eurasia and North Africa (Saudi Arabia, UAE, Libya, Tunisia and now Algeria). Quantities of FMD vaccine based upon virus strains chosen following vaccine matching results on the circulating O India 2001 topotype have been announced to be supplied by the EU to Tunisia and Algeria (see 20140804.2659287).

According to the Algerian press, citing the Ministry of Agriculture, as of 6 Aug 2014, the number of infected provinces has reached 16. They are: Chlef, Khenchela, Jijel, Tizi Ouzou, Bordj Bou Arreridj, Djelfa, Blida, Alger, Setif, Bouira, Constantine, Batna, Medea, Bejaia, Boumerdes and Souk Ahras. The most western one, Chlef (formerly Orleansville) is about 200 km west of the capital Algiers and 300 km east of the border with Morocco. For Algeria's map, see http://tinyurl.com/p9a4pzf.

Early accomplishment of vaccination, covering large and small ruminants, is essential for the control of this epizootic. Revaccinations may be required as well. While the slaughter of all animals on affected premises may somewhat slow the virus spread, the continuous, uncontrolled movements of small ruminants (which have not been vaccinated in Algeria!) poses a serious threat of further spread within and beyond the country.

The epizootic in North Africa has, so far, affected Libya, Tunisia and Algeria and is a cause for concern in other countries, particularly neighbouring Morocco, the ruminant population of which is fully susceptible, since no FMD vaccinations have been applied there for years. A look at the map will illuminate the need for alertness in European countries such as Spain, France and Italy; see items 2 and 3. - Mod.AS]

[2] French alertness

Cases of FMD are currently being seen in North Africa. Although this virus is harmless to humans, its possible introduction to Europe, particularly during periods of summer vacation, pose a real threat to cattle farms, sheep, goats and pigs in our country [France] and especially in Brittany.

The Regional Directorate for Food, Agriculture and Forestry provides some recommendations to prevent the introduction and spread of the disease in France. The following advice addresses travelers to Tunisia, Algeria, Libya and Egypt:

- It is forbidden to bring in live animals and animal products (dairy or meat) as well as other animal-derived articles such as horns, fur and leftovers.
- When in these countries, avoid contact with cattle, sheep, goats, camels and pigs that are of species susceptible to FMD.
- Back in France, clothing and shoes used during the trip must be cleaned and disinfected before approaching susceptible animals.

Farmers are advised to make sure that outsiders entering their holdings clean and disinfect their shoes. Preferably, disposable shoe-covers should be supplied to visitors. Animal breeders are being updated about the main symptoms of FMD and urged to call their vets to examine any suspected case, "the visits to be supported by the state."

In addition, vehicles coming from or transiting through the infected countries should not enter the premises; the supply of forage, straw and litter from these countries is banned.
