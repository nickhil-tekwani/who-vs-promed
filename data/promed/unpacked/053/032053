At least 4 people have died of suspected anthrax and many others
seriously afflicted in a couple of weeks at Chancharaguda area under
Bissamcuttack block of Rayagada district [Orissa state]. The exact
number of the victims has not yet been ascertained as the tribal
people usually prefer "disari" (a traditional village doctor) to
professional doctors, and any case of death while under treatment with
the disaris remains unreported, sources said.

The disease claimed many lives in the same region last year [2008] too
[see ProMED archives below]. This time, the matter has come to the
fore after some people brought the matter to the notice of the
personnel of the nearest PHC [Primary Health Center]. A medical team
was immediately rushed to the area. The patients were treated and
blood samples were collected.

The medical officials were informed about the deaths of [the 4 named
dead, ages 30-45]. Many others were checked by the health service
personnel. Their condition is said to be out of danger. A 12-year-old
boy is reportedly undergoing treatment at Bissamcuttack Christian
Hospital.

Dr Nabakishore Kundu of Bissamcuttack CHC [Community Health Cell]
opined that consumption of stale meat may be the prime reason. "Lack
of awareness mainly due to illiteracy is the biggest hindrance in
providing treatment to the affected tribal people. We have been
convincing them [to get] health checkups, but with little success," he
said. [It is not stale, but infected, meat that is the culprit -

[Same old, same old story. It is long overdue for the Indian states
affected by this disease to get together and mount an effective
surveillance and control programme. The latter is not complicated and
the significant numbers of human cases each year indicates a public
health risk, quite apart from the greater implications for an
effective veterinary response. Those states with repeated outbreaks
are well known. In 2007 OIE reported outbreaks in Andra Pradesh,
Gujurat (aka Gujarat), Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Orissa,
Pondicherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, while ProMED reported the
outbreaks in Andra Pradesh and Orissa, and also a suspected outbreak
in Kerala.
