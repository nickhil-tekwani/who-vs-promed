Cows in Ishikawa Prefecture show signs of foot-and-mouth disease
----------------------------------------------------------------
More than a dozen cows in Ishikawa Prefecture were found to show
signs of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], but the likelihood that they
have been infected with the contagious virus appears low, farm
ministry officials said early on Saturday [12 Feb 2011].

Genetic testing will be conducted on the cows' samples, and the test
results are expected on Saturday afternoon [12 Feb 2011], the
officials said. If the animals are confirmed to have FMD, it would
follow the outbreak from April to August last year [2010], when cows
and pigs in Miyazaki Prefecture were infected with the illness.

The Ishikawa prefectural government said 15 cows bred at a paddock in
the central Japanese prefecture facing the Sea of Japan were found to
have FMD-like symptoms, such as blisters on their tongues.

But officials of the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry
said that photos of the cows in question indicate that the possibility
of infection seems low.

A total of 243 cows, including those for milking, are kept at the
paddock, according to the prefectural government.

[The differential diagnosis of oral lesions in cattle includes,
besides FMD, the viral diseases vesicular stomatitis (clinically
indistinguishable from FMD), rinderpest, infectious bovine
rhinotracheitis (IBR), bovine viral diarrhea (BVD), malignant
catarrhal fever (MCF), and epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD).
Vesicular stomatitis, known to be endemic in the Americas, has never
been reported in Japan (nor known to be present elsewhere in the
Eastern hemisphere). Rinderpest was eradicated in Japan since 1924.
The remaining 4 disease entities are known to be present in Japan,
though the likelihood of EHD, a culicoid-borne disease, to appear in
the wintertime is rather negligible.

Results of the laboratory tests are expected soon. - Mod.AS
