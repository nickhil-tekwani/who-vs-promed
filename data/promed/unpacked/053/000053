Food maker Nestle USA on Friday [19 Jun 2009] voluntarily recalled
its Toll House refrigerated cookie dough products after a number of
illnesses were reported by those who ate the dough raw. The company
said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are investigating reported _E.
coli_ illnesses that might be related to the ingestion of raw cookie
dough.

In a statement, the FDA said there have been 66 reports of illness
across 28 states since March 2009. About 25 people have been
hospitalized, but no one has died. The FDA advised consumers to throw
away any prepackaged, refrigerated Nestle Toll House cookie dough
products in their homes. Retailers, restaurateurs and employees at
other food-service operations should also not sell or serve any of
the products.

Nestle spokeswoman Roz O'Hearn said, "This has been a very quickly
moving situation," adding the company took action less than 24 hours
after hearing of the problem." O'Hearn said the company will
"cooperate fully" with the FDA's investigation.

The recall includes refrigerated cookie bar dough, cookie dough tub,
cookie dough tubes, limited edition cookie dough items, seasonal
cookie dough and Ultimates cookie bar dough. It does not affect any
other Toll House products.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) are warning consumers not to eat any
varieties of prepackaged Nestle Toll House refrigerated cookie dough
due to the risk of contamination with _E. coli_ O157:H7 (a bacterium
that causes food borne illness).

The FDA advises that if consumers have any prepackaged, refrigerated
Nestle Toll House cookie dough products in their home that they throw
them away. Cooking the dough is not recommended because consumers
might get the bacteria on their hands and on other cooking surfaces.

Retailers, restaurateurs, and personnel at other food-service
operations should not sell or serve any Nestle Toll House
prepackaged, refrigerated cookie dough products subject to the recall.

Nestle USA, which manufactures and markets the Toll House cookie
dough, is fully cooperating with the ongoing investigation by the FDA
and the CDC. The warning is based on an ongoing epidemiological study
conducted by the CDC and several state and local health departments.
Since March 2009 there have been 66 reports of illness across 28
states. 25 persons were hospitalized; 7 with a severe complication
called Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS). No one has died.

_E. coli_ O157:H7 causes abdominal cramping, vomiting and a diarrheal
illness, often with bloody stools. Most healthy adults can recover
completely within a week. Young children and the elderly are at
highest risk for developing HUS, which can lead to serious kidney
damage and even death.

Individuals who have recently eaten prepackaged, refrigerated Toll
House cookie dough and have experienced any of these symptoms should
contact their doctor or health care provider immediately. Any such
illnesses should be reported to state or local health authorities.

The FDA reminds consumers they should not eat raw food products that
are intended for cooking or baking before consumption. Consumers
should use safe food-handling practices when preparing such products,
including following package directions for cooking at proper
temperatures; washing hands, surfaces, and utensils after contact
with these types of products; avoiding cross contamination; and
refrigerating products properly.
