A cluster of Japanese encephalitis virus infection has been confirmed in Kaohsiung's Linyuan District, including 2 confirmed cases and one suspected case, an official with the city's health department said [Mon2 8 May 2018].

As the residences of the 2 confirmed cases and the suspected case are all within about 2 km [1.24 mi] of each other, the cases were categorized as a cluster infection, according to Pan Chao-ying, the head of the health department's disease control division.

Health authorities have checked 7 pig farms in areas near the residences, while disease prevention and control staff have started a round-the-clock fight against mosquitoes by installing over 100 mosquito traps in the residences of the cases and nearby areas. As a result, from [3 to 27 May 2018], 32 000 _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquitoes have been caught, according to the department's statistics.

The health department will continue its disease prevention and control efforts throughout late June [2018], Pan said, while calling on the public to prevent Japanese encephalitis by getting vaccinated and taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites in at-risk areas.

As the primary vector, the _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquito is known to breed in paddy fields, ponds and irrigation canals; people are advised to avoid visiting those places at dawn and dusk when mosquitoes are most active, according to the health department.

People suffering from Japanese encephalitis can experience serious psychological and neurological symptoms. Symptoms usually take 5-15 days to develop and include fever, headache, vomiting, confusion, and difficulty moving. The disease has a mortality rate [for clinical disease] of as high as 20 percent-30 percent, it said.

[The Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) transmission is now getting underway in Taiwan as indicated by the number of _Culex tritaeniorhynchus_ mosquitoes captured over the past 3 weeks and the new cases mentioned above. This mosquito species is an efficient vector of JEV. Additional cases can be expected to occur sporadically over the next 4-5 months. The number of JE cases last year (2017) in Taiwan reached 25. JE virus is endemic in Taiwan and has caused cases sporadically there during the May-October season. _Culex_ mosquitoes are abundant enough there to accomplish transmission of the virus from birds and swine to people.

Japanese encephalitis is a vaccine-preventable disease; the affected individuals above probably had not been vaccinated. The only measures to prevent infection are vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites. Well targeted vector mosquito reduction program can be helpful as well. - Mod.TY
