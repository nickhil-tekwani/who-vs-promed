A total of 206 West Nile [WN] fever cases have been registered in
Russia's southern Volgograd region since 16 Jul [2010], the local
health authorities said on Wednesday [1 Sep 2010], adding that 5 have
died. "In the period from 16 Jul-1 Sep 2010, a total of 206 West Nile
fever cases were registered, including 162 in Volgograd (87 percent),
7 in the town of Volzhsky (3.7 percent), 17 in other regions'
municipalities (9.1 percent)," the local health authorities said in a
press release posted on the website of the National Consumer Rights
Supervision Service, or Rospotrebnadzor.

According to the release, from 10-20 new cases are reported daily.
The disease is diagnosed in people of all age categories but tells
more severely on the elderly, who have other chronic diseases. As
many as 5 patients have died of West Nile fever, mainly those aged 60
and older. The majority of cases (80 percent) are of moderate
severity. "All those who caught the disease have been hospitalised.
They are in satisfactory condition," the local authorities said.

According to Rospotrebnadzor experts, the Volgograd region's climatic
conditions and the natural migration of birds, which nest in the
Volga delta in summer, "create favourable conditions for the spread
of the virus and for the formation of a natural focus of the disease,
which has [been] active since 1999."

[In addition to the 5 fatal WN cases in the Volgograd oblast, the 26
Aug 2010 report indicated that there was one fatality in the Rostov
oblast (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100831.3095). The number of WN
cases has increased from 107 in that report to the 162 mentioned in
the above report, and appears to be accelerating.

Since mid-August [2010], 11 people have died from the so-called "West
Nile virus" in northern Greece, and another 150 are infected by it,
said the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO). The
last 2 victims of this disease, registered the day before yesterday
and yesterday [30, 31 Aug 2010], were old men with a history of other
health problems.

Another 12 cases of infection were added to the 138 existing cases of
the West Nile virus so far recognized in northern Greece, which
causes encephalitis and is transmitted through mosquito bites.
