2004/120 Details on the situation of Citrus tristeza closterovirus, and its
vector _Toxoptera citricida_, in Belize
-----------------------------------
Citrus tristeza closterovirus (CTV - EPPO A2 list) was discovered in Belize
in 1984 on 74 sites in the Stann Creek Valley. In 1993, a survey showed
that 14.9 percent of samples were positive for CTV mild strains, and 4
percent for the severe strains. Since the discovery of CTV, growers have
been advised to use CTV-tolerant rootstocks.
A certification program was initiated in 1994. _Toxoptera citricida_ [Tc]
(_Homoptera_: _Aphididae_ - EPPO A1 list), which is an efficient vector,
was noticed in Belize. Further studies [were conducted] on the CTV
situation, particularly in orchards of citrus grafted onto sour orange
rootstocks (_Citrus aurantium_). 4 plots of Valencia orange grafted onto
sour orange rootstocks were selected on the basis for their high and low
CTV infection levels. Observations and tests were done during a 6-year
period (1997 to 2003).
Results showed fluctuations in infection levels, but no decline symptoms
were observed in the tested plots. The impact of CTV spread by Tc has
varied among Caribbean countries. In Jamaica, a widespread decline of trees
grafted onto sour orange was observed soon after the introduction of Tc,
and, in the Dominican Republic, only mild strains were detected after the
introduction of the vector. However, in 1996, severe strains started to be
detected, and decline symptoms were observed in 1998, which may indicate
that severe strains were introduced into the Dominican Republic.

[Tristeza, known as "quick decline" in the United States, is the most
destructive disease of citrus in the western hemisphere, and, is worldwide
in distribution. Affected trees may suffer from quick decline, which leads
to wilting and death in a few weeks. Other syndromes are seedling yellows
and stem pitting disease. Only trees on sour orange rootstock are affected
by tristeza decline. CTV causes an incompatibility at the bud union,
resulting in girdling of affected trees. The virus is spread in a
persistent manner by _Toxoptera citricida_ (brown citrus aphid) and _Aphis
gossypii_ (cotton or melon aphid). Most CTV isolates can be detected by
grafting to plants of Mexican lime (_Citrus aurantifolia_), or by ELISA.
The monoclonal antibody MCA-13 detects most CTV strains that affect tops on
sour orange rootstocks.
Disease management utilizes certified bud-stock and resistant rootstocks,
production of virus-free trees by shoot-tip grafting or heat treatment,
production of trees in areas known to be free of CTV, inoculation of
bud-stock trees with mild CTV strains, and occasional applications of
chemical insecticides to reduce aphid populations.
