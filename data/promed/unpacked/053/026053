Romania has found suspected bird flu in hens in another village 100 km (60
miles) east of Bucharest, where an outbreak was detected last week,
officials said on Monday [19 Dec 2005].
The H5 type of the virus was confirmed last week in 2 villages in Ialomita
county, indicating the avian disease could be spreading towards the
capital. Since October, the Balkan country has found avian flu in 21
villages in and around the Danube delta where the deadly strain of the
virus was 1st discovered 300 km from Bucharest. 9 cases have been confirmed
as the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. But the disease has not appeared
close to large cities and officials have said it was unlikely to break out
there.
"Preliminary tests taken from several hens in the village of Traian show
[signs of] the H5 type, but the virus hasn't been isolated yet," Nicolae
Stefan, head of the Animal Health and Diagnosis Institute, told Reuters.
He said the village will be quarantined and all domestic fowl destroyed as
a precaution.
H5N1 is endemic in poultry in parts of Asia, where it has killed more than
70 people since late 2003. The virus remains hard for people to catch, but
there are fears it could mutate into a form easily transmissible among
humans. There have been no cases in people outside of Asia.

A member of party Council "Our Ukraine", the Emergency Minister Viktor
Baloha, said that the localization of bird flu outbreaks contributed to the
necessity to put the whole Crimean Autonomous Region under quarantine.
A meeting of [those in charge of fighting] bird flu took place on Saturday
[17 Dec 2005]. The head, Viktor Baloha, the Agrarian Minister Oleksandr
Baranivskyi, as well as the head of the Crimea Council of Ministers Anatoly
Burdyuhov and the head of the Crimea Verkhovna Rada Borys Deych were present.
Oleksandr Baranivskyi told about the necessity to put the whole peninsula
under quarantine. The Crimean PM said that it would have a considerable
effect on Crimean autonomy.
"Any decision on this reason will be taken together" -- Viktor Baloha
emphasized. --"Veterinary Service of Ukraine has a competence to take this
decision".
"Our group and representatives of the Agrarian Ministry, the Interior
Ministry and the Healthy Ministry are doing their best to localize the
outbreaks within a zone 3 km in diameter. It is necessary to slaughter the
poultry in this area. We think it is the best way. If the epidemic spreads
further, we will have no other way out except Baranivskyi's proposition,"
Viktor Baloha said.
"On the other hand, Burdyuhov is right saying that 20 percent of all
production of poultry meat is in Crimea. That's why the [Crimean Autonomous
Region] will sustain serious financial loss in a case of quarantine. It
will have an effect on producers. That's why the Crimean PM and the head of
Crimean Parliament have something to worry about," the minister says.
"I must admit that preventative and [educational] measures in some Crimean
settlements were [incomplete]. Not all poultry is kept [in enclosed areas]
even in the villages we have visited. That's why the headquarters have
fixed the period of a week during which the struggle against bird flu has
to improve. Otherwise we will have to put the whole territory of Crimea
under quarantine," Baloha said.
