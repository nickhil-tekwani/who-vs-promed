U-turn on Use of Re-usable Surgical Instruments
-----------------------------------------------
The UK Government has been forced to make a u-turn on the use of
re-usable surgical instruments for tonsil and adenoid surgery. The use
of re-useable instruments had been withdrawn in Jan 2001 because
doctors feared there was a theoretical risk of transmission of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease [abbreviated as vCJD or CJD (new var.) in
ProMED-mail from re-usable surgical instruments. However, following
the change, surgeons found more patients than before were being harmed
during surgery. There was even one death linked to single-use
instruments. Now doctors have been told they can return to using
re-usable instruments.
The Department of Health (DoH) has now issued fresh instructions to
surgeons after meetings with the British Association of
Otorhinolaryngologists (BAO) about the adverse events caused by
single-use instruments and the balance of risks to patients. The DoH
said: "This represents an actual risk to patients, compared with a
theoretical risk of transmission of vCJD." Most incidents involved
increased bleeding, but a single-use diathermy forceps tool which
cauterises the wound to halt bleeding was suspended from use on 4 Dec
2001 following the death of a patient.
The recommendation to move to single-use instruments came after advice
from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC). It
recommended a pilot scheme to see how single-use instruments would
work in practice. SEAC has stressed that the key step in reducing any
risk of vCJD transmission is the rigorous implementation of washing,
decontamination, and general hygiene procedures in the health care
setting. The DoH said that given the balance of risks, surgeons could
return to using re-usable surgical equipment, which should be
sterilised in the normal way.

[In the UK approximately 78 000 tonsillectomies are carried out per
year, which even at a single death per year makes the risk of death
from tonsillectomy with single-use instruments greater than that of
the probability of contracting vCJD by current estimates.
There is a need to apply the same type of risk assessment to the
supply of blood for transfusion during surgery. - Mod.CP
