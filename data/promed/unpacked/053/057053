[This outbreak, in eastern Belarus (map appended to the OIE report, available at the source URL above), is the 2nd ASF outbreak reported from Belarus; the 1st one was reported (21 Jun 2013) in Grodno, in the west of the country, close to Lithuania.

The "stamping out", as indicated in the report, refers to 1089 animals out of the 20 611 "susceptible" ones. Information on the criteria for the selection of animals to be culled, will be helpful.

According to an earlier local media report ("Telegraf", 1 Jul 2013, in Russian), the authorities provided compensation to the owners of culled animals at the rate of 18.3 rubles (about USD 0.55) per kg (live?) body weight. The report includes photographs of the site of the outbreak; see at http://tinyurl.com/p9sat47 (thanks to Sabine Zentis for sending this report). - Mod.AS
