[1] Pakistan (Peshawar): wild birds, suspected

Residents of the provincial capital and the areas adjacent to it have been
scared by reports of bird flu after hundreds of crows and kites (cheel)
have mysteriously died in the area in the 3 days following confirmation of
bird flu in 2 NWFP [North West Frontier Province] districts.
Reports of dead crows and kites, confirmed by locals and livestock disease
investigation officials, had been coming in from Shahi Bagh, Charsadda
Road, Gulf Course Avenue, University Camp and Palosai.
The medical community also expressed apprehensions about the birds' deaths.
Prof Dr Farmanullah of the Agriculture University, Peshawar confirmed the
deaths of 4 crows in his house. Similarly, Dr Munir of Peshawar University
also confirmed death of crows inside and outside his house. "I was not very
scared by the deaths of the crows in my house, but it was the number of
dead birds I saw outside my house that unsettled me," he said, adding that
the unusual and sudden deaths of these birds could well be attributed to
the deadly bird flu virus. Reports of unusual bird deaths have also been
confirmed in the Bajaur Agency, where several domesticated chickens and
wild birds have died since bird flu was confirmed in Charsadda and Abbottabad.
Dr Shir Mohammad, disease investigation officer at the NWFP Veterinary
Research Institute, Peshawar, has also confirmed unusual deaths of crows
and kites. "After receiving these reports, I dispatched my team to these
areas to collect blood samples from the dead birds immediately," he said.
Dr Shir Mohammad said that the team collected blood samples from the birds,
which were sent to the National Veterinary Research Laboratory in
Islamabad, for testing. He said, however, that these birds usually died at
this time of year. But this year, he said, the deaths of these birds had
proved more alarming, since the presence of the bird flu virus had been
confirmed in nearby Charsadda district. "We cannot be sure until we receive
the blood test results," he concluded.

[2] Czech Republic, swan: first case, H5

The first case of bird flu in its H5 form has been detected in a dead swan
in the Czech Republic, and officials suspect that it could be the dangerous
H5N1 strain of the virus. "We have a serious suspicion of the presence of
H5N1, which will either be confirmed or not," minister of agriculture Jan
Mladek told a news conference. "We want the information to be as precise as
possible. We do not want to hide anything. Bird flu is dangerous but there
is no reason to panic," he added.
The virus was discovered in a dead swan at Hlubokou Nad Vltava in the south
of the country around 150 km (95 miles) south of Prague on 20 Mar 2006.
Further tests will be carried out in the Czech Republic and samples are to
be sent to the European Union laboratories in Britain, the head of the
state veterinary service, Milan Malena, told AFP after the news conference.
If the potentially deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu is confirmed, special
measures will be taken, including the creation of 3 and 10 km security
zones around the place where the dead swan was found. "We must learn to
live with this disease in the same way that we learned to live with mad cow
disease," Mladek added.
While all its neighbours -- Austria, Slovakia, Germany and Poland -- have
announced cases of bird flu, the Czech Republic has so far stood out as the
sole exception in Central Europe. Nevertheless, preparations to deal with
contamination have already been in place for several weeks.

[3] Indonesia (Papua): suspected

Bird flu has been identified in the Indonesian province of Papua, which
shares the same land mass with Papua New Guinea.
National Agriculture Quarantine Inspection Authority officer in Kiunga
Kaiki Namalu said the disease has been positively identified at Timika, the
town that services the controversial Freeport Copper mine. [Timika is in
south central Papua Province, Indonesia; map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/ID/0/Timuka.html>; Kiunga is a Papua New
Guinea town near the central border; map at
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/PP/6/Kiunga.html> and at the PNG map
<http://www.sitesatlas.com/Maps/Maps/png-pol.htm>]
Mr Namalu said the National Agriculture Quarantine Inspection Authority has
placed a ban on the movement of birds and poultry to and from the West
Sepik and Western provinces. He said many people living in Kiunga and
Tabubil liked to take cassowary chicks [any of several large flightless
birds of the genus _Casuarius_ of Australia, New Guinea, and adjacent
areas, having a large bony projection on the top of the head and brightly
colored wattles] and guria pigeons [crested or crowned pigeons, _Goura
victoria_; see picture at
<http://www.bristolzoo.org.uk/learning/animals/birds/crowned-pigeon>] from
the 2 towns back to their home provinces when they go on holiday breaks.
But he cautioned people should not panic, despite the coverage that the
disease had been receiving in the international media.
Instead, Namalu said all people in the 2 border provinces had to be extra
vigilant, and if they see birds they suspect of having the disease, they
should report to the nearest Department of Primary Industry office or the
National Agriculture Quarantine Inspection Authority office. He also said
healthy live chickens could still bought from the markets and there was
nothing wrong with frozen chickens purchased from stores and supermarkets.
Namalu said the symptoms in birds were the same as in humans -- infected
birds will be seen sneezing, the comb on the head of male chickens drooping
and not erect as on healthy roosters. The infected birds will also look
drowsy and lack energy.

[4] Sweden, mink: H5
Date: Tue, 28 Mar 2006

Swedish veterinarians have found a mink with an aggressive form of the H5
bird flu virus and had the mammal put down, the National Veterinary
Institute said on Monday [27 Mar 2006].
The animal was found in the Blekinge region of south Sweden, an area where
several bird flu cases have been found. What is initially described as an
aggressive form of H5 bird flu is often later confirmed as the highly
pathogenic H5N1 virus.
The mink probably got the disease from eating wild birds which were already
infected, the Institute said in a statement.
The H5N1 bird flu virus can infect humans who come into contact with
infected poultry and has killed more than 100 people since late 2003. The
virus has also recently been detected in a marten, a weasel-like mammal,
cats in Germany, and a dog in Azerbaijan [see comment].
The World Health Organisation says that so far only domestic poultry are
known to have played a role in transmitting the virus from animals to
humans, but it has called for further investigation into the significance
of infection in other mammals.

[The current USGS list of species affected by H5N1 (avian influenza), based
upon referenced reports of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in
wildlife and domestic animals, includes the following mammals (website
<http://www.nwhc.usgs.gov/disease_information/avian_influenza/affected_species_chart.jsp>,
accessed 28 Mar 2006):
1. Owston Palm Civet (_Chrotogale owstoni_);
2. Domestic/feral cat (_Felis domestica_);
3. Cynomolgus macaques (_Macaca fascicularis_);
4. Stone (beech) marten (_Martes foina_);
5. Ferret (_Mustela putoris furo_);
6. New Zealand white rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_);
7. Leopard (_Panthera pardus_);
8. Tiger (_Panthera tigris_);
9. Rat (_Rattus norvegicus_);
10. Pig (_Sus domesticus_).
Another big cat, the clouded leopard (_Neofelis nebulosa_) deserves to be
included in the list (thanks to Dr Joe Dudley for this reminder). This is
based upon referenced reports (20040221.0560, cited by Kuiken et al, 2004;
WHO source, <http://www.who.int/csr/don/2006_02_28a/en/index.html>; Science
2004; 305 (3 Sep), at
<http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/305/5689/1385a.pdf>).
If/when the H5 virus detected in the Swedish mink [_Mustela_) is identified
as H5N1, this species deserves to be added to the list.
As to the 2 suspected dogs, one (alive) in Thailand in Oct 2004 (see
20041003.2731), the other one (stray, dead) in Azerbaijan in March 2006
(see 20060316.0818): in the absence of references, these reports are
currently regarded as anecdotal. Complementary information on H5N1 in
canines will be welcomed. - Mod.AS]
