A case of H7N7 avian flu has now been confirmed in Lancashire.

A temporary control zone imposed on Friday [10 Jul 2015] at the affected farm has now been replaced by a 10-km surveillance zone and an inner 3-km protection zone. Restrictions remain in place, and the humane culling of all birds at the farm is continuing.

Public Health England has confirmed that the risk to public health from this strain is very low. The Food Standards Agency has said there is no food safety risk for consumers.

The restrictions mean that all poultry farms within the 10-km control zone around the infected premises are not allowed to move poultry, captive birds or other mammals except under licence.

Chief Veterinary Officer, Nigel Gibbens said:

"Final test results have confirmed a case of avian flu at a farm in Lancashire. Restrictions put in place last week will continue, and the humane culling of all birds at the site is progressing. These actions are part of our tried and tested approach to dealing with previous outbreaks.

Bird keepers should remain alert for any signs of disease, report suspect disease to their nearest APHA office immediately, and ensure they are maintaining good biosecurity on their premises.

We have a strong track record of controlling and eliminating previous outbreaks of avian flu in the UK. The outbreaks in Yorkshire last year [2014] and Hampshire in February 2015 were both successfully contained, allowing restrictions to be lifted at the earliest opportunity.

An investigation into this case is ongoing.

Anyone suspecting avian flu (bird flu) should contact their nearest Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA) office immediately (https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/animal-and-plant-health-agency/about/access-and-opening)."

[The above official press release does not specify the pathogenicity of the virus strain involved. According to a media report (see Daily Mail at http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3159119/Deadly-H7N7-bird-flu-CONFIRMED-Lancashire-chicken-farm.html), the causative agent of this outbreak has been identified as HPAI H7N7. Official confirmation or otherwise is anticipated.

During the massive outbreak of H7N7 in the Netherlands in 2003, 31 million birds had to be culled. One human case involved fatal respiratory distress syndrome in a veterinarian who was in close contact with infected poultry. Reportedly, 86 cases in poultry workers and 3 cases in people with no poultry contact were initially confirmed by PCR. Dutch researchers later discovered that a considerable number of people who worked with sick chickens had antibodies to the virus. It was also suspected that some of the seropositive humans did not have direct contact with the infected birds. However, clinical manifestations were uncommon, in most cases, only self-limiting conjunctivitis. - Mod.AS
