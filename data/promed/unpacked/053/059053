[Highly pathogenic avian influenza has frequently caused infection and death of birds of prey (Falconiformes). Raptors may contract highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 by hunting or scavenging infected prey. Peregrine falcons (_Falco peregrinus_) regularly pray on Anseriformes, the main reservoir of avian influenza viruses, which make them prone to become infected. - Mod.PMB
