Outbreak of Q fever in Germany
-----------------------
Eurosurveillance Weekly recently reported on 3 cases of Q fever in the
United Kingdom, which affected farm workers helping to cull cattle
during an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the country
(1). Elsewhere in Europe, Q fever has been associated with sheep
flocks passing populated areas (1). A prolonged outbreak in Germany
between December 2000 and May 2001 was recently reported in
Germany's national surveillance bulletin (2).
The outbreak affected 3 adjacent county districts in the German state
of North-Rhine Westphalia, and sheep were implicated as its likely
source. Altogether 73 cases were notified to the Robert Koch-Institut
(RKI) in Berlin by the district where the first outbreak occurred; 5 of
these did not have clinical symptoms. The epidemic peaked from 30
Jan 2001 to 17 Feb 2001 (week 5-7); after 1 May 2001 the number of
new cases had dropped to 1 or 2 per week.
Veterinary investigations of blood specimens showed several flocks of
sheep in the district were the likely source of infection. The likely
transmission route was inhaled dust containing _Coxiella burnetii_
from contaminated afterbirth deposited during the lambing season.
Local physicians and the public were kept informed by the health
authorities and the media. There was a potential risk of transmission to
a large number of people attending an open-air theater festival season
in the town of Hallenberg, an annual event taking place between June
and September, but no additional cases were notified.
As a result of strict preventive measures imposed on sheep farmers in
the area, after the end of the lambing season the number of notified
cases decreased; the last case was notified at the end of May (week 21).
Two neighboring country districts reported 25 and 2 cases of Q fever,
respectively, to RKI in weeks 7-24, most of whom lived in close
proximity to the first district. Preventive measures were imposed on
sheep farmers, and the public and local physicians were informed by
the local authorities in both these districts. No further cases have been
reported since week 24.
In a special meeting on 9 May, which was attended by experts and
representatives from authorities at a federal, state, and local level from
all 3 affected districts, it was decided that, although the current risk of
transmission was low, it could not be excluded altogether, and the
following measures were imposed on sheep farmers in the region:
- Lambing must take place inside a building located outside a
residential area.
- The doors have to be kept shut until after the birth and after disposal
of the contaminated straw.
- Ewes and newborn lambs have to be kept indoors for a minimum of
14 days after the birth.
- Afterbirths and stillbirths must be collected in closed sealed
containers and disposed of through a disposal unit for animal
carcasses.
- After collection of the body parts, the containers have to be cleaned
and disinfected immediately.
- Contaminated straw and dung must be piled up, covered with a
strong plastic cover, secured against wind damage, and kept untouched
for 2 years, after which it may be used as fertilizer.
- Shearing is allowed only in buildings outside a residential area. The
staff must wear protective masks. The wool has to be kept in an
enclosed room until collection.
- After shearing, the sheep have to be treated with a chemical bath to
eliminate ticks.
- Grazing areas must not be closer than 700 meters to residential or
industrial areas (except for Hallenberg, but no details are available with
regard to the limit there).
These measures take into account the transmission routes and aim at
preventing contact of the population with contaminated afterbirth of
sheep. It may be advisable to extend the time ewes and lambs are kept
indoors to a total of 8 weeks. Humans should also avoid exposure to
dust from the fleece, which may be contaminated by excretions of
ticks, which are a known host for _C. burnetii_ [the rickettsial
organism that causes Q fever.
