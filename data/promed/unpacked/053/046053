The United States could ease its ban on imports of European pork and
poultry if it was sure the products were free of cancer-causing dioxin,
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said.
Consumer and food-industry groups endorsed the decision announced Thursday
to block the imports in the wake of the biggest food scare in Europe since
the "mad cow" outbreak in Britain earlier this decade. They called it a
prudent precaution.
Most of the poultry products eaten by Americans are produced at home
although a few million pounds (kg), mostly pate, are imported. About $250
million of European pork was shipped to the US market last year.
Meat-safety officials are reviewing pork and poultry imports from the
European Union since January, when the contamination is believed to have
begun, to see if additional action is needed.
At present, there are no US guidelines for importers or distributors on
clearing products for entry. Handlers might be required to test imports for
dioxin or provide documents showing their goods came from safe areas.
Two years ago, U.S. meat-safety officials briefly closed 300 poultry,
livestock and egg processing plants in southern states after dioxin was
found in animal feed. Fish and meat processors were required to make sure
dioxin levels in their products were below the federal threshold of one
part per trillion (1ppt).
"We've faced this problem in the United States. We would expect them to be
just as tough (on imports)," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food
safety at the consumer group Center for Science in the Public Interest.
"Even low levels of dioxin may increase a person's chances of cancer."
The Belgian food scare erupted amid a transatlantic dispute over European
resistance to the genetic modification of food and the use of synthetic
hormones to fatten cattle, practices that are common in the United States.
"Perhaps the Europeans ought to be paying more attention to the more
immediate food safety problems than safety concerns about GMOs (genetically
modified organisms), which are much more theoretical," said Art Jaeger of
the Consumer Federation of America, one of the larger U.S. consumer groups.
Glickman said he did not expect the dioxin scare to have any impact on U.S.
efforts to get the EU to drop its decade-old ban on so-called hormone beef.
"That's a separate issue," he said.
The United States has threatened to impose 100 percent duties on EU pork
and poultry, among other imports, in retaliation for the hormone-beef ban.
