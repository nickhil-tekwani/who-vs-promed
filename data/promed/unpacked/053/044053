_Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ (Avian mycoplasmosis), Singapore
-----------------------------------------------------------
Summary
Report type: Immediate notification
Started: 24 Mar 2022
Confirmed: 24 Mar 2022
Reported: 28 Mar 2022
Reason for notification: Recurrence
Last occurrence: 31 Dec 1986
Causal agent: _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_
Nature of diagnosis: Clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to the whole country.

Outbreak location: North, Singapore
Started: 24 Mar 2022
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Birds / 917 519 / 6 / - / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Pooled organ samples (lung and trachea) were collected as part of a separate ongoing disease investigation on a local chicken layer farm. Affected flocks were noted to have respiratory signs and decreased egg production. _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ genetic material was detected via PCR from the samples taken. This was confirmed by sequencing.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Detection of _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ [MG] is likely to be an incidental finding as part of a comorbidity related to disease investigation. _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ genetic material was detected via PCR from the samples taken. This was confirmed by sequencing. MG was last known to be present in Singapore in 1986. MG vaccine is registered and approved for use in Singapore and stakeholders will be advised accordingly.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: Movement control

["Avian mycoplasmosis is caused by several pathogenic mycoplasmas of which _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ (MG) and _M. synoviae_ (MS) are the most important; they are the only ones listed by the OIE.

"MG causes chronic respiratory disease of domestic poultry, especially in the presence of management stresses and/or other respiratory pathogens. Disease is characterized by coryza, conjunctivitis, sneezing, and by sinusitis, particularly in turkeys and game birds. It can result in loss of production and downgrading of meat-type birds, and loss of egg production. MS may cause respiratory disease, synovitis, or may result in a silent infection. MG and MS strains vary in infectivity and virulence, and infections may sometimes be unapparent.

"Although the preferred method of control is maintenance of MG- and MS-free flocks, both live and inactivated vaccines are used in chickens. Vaccination should be considered only on multi-age sites where infection is inevitable. The normal use is to prevent egg-production losses in commercial layers, although vaccines may also be used to reduce egg transmission in breeding stock or to aid MG eradication on multi-age sites. It is important to vaccinate before field challenge occurs" (Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual 2021, Chapter 3.35 Avian mycoplasmosis (_Mycoplasma gallisepticum_, _M. synoviae_); https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.03.05_%20AVIAN_MYCO.pdf).

"There is no evidence that _Mycoplasma gallisepticum_ is zoonotic" (Source: http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/avian_mycoplasmosis_mycoplasma_gallisepticum.pdf). - Mod.CRD
