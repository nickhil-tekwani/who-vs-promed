A United States zoo has begun inoculating big cats, bears, and ferrets against the virus using an experimental vaccine, as efforts are ramped up to protect animal species from the coronavirus.

The Oakland Zoo in the San Francisco Bay Area administered the shot to its tigers Ginger and Molly, as well as black and grizzly bears, mountain lions, and ferrets. Primates and pigs are next on the list.

The shots have been donated by the veterinary pharmaceutical company Zoetis, which aims to deliver 11 000 doses for animals in nearly 70 zoos.

[The development of effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to be used in mammals other than humans is very important, not only to protect animals in direct contact with people from the disease but also to avoid that the virus finds a niche where to be maintained and evolve as immunity in people builds up globally through to natural infection and vaccination.

Some mammalian species (especially carnivores like felids and mustelids) are susceptible to becoming infected by SARS-CoV-2, and in some cases, they were found to be able to transmit the infection to other conspecifics. An outstanding example is the American mink. The coronavirus spilled from infected people to minks in fur farms, and the virus propagated in these animals, in some cases evolving a mink-variant which was found to jump back to people.

Once the pandemic is under control, our aspirations of eradicating SARS-CoV-2 will largely depend on surveillance efforts in susceptible mammals and vaccination of animals in direct contact with humans. - Mod.PMB
