A total of 2.5 million children under the age of 5 in Myanmar were
vaccinated against polio during the country's 3rd round of the polio
vaccination campaign in the last 5 days under an expanded program on
immunization, the local Myanmar Times reported Monday [9 Jul 2007].
The 3rd round of the campaign lasted from [4-8 Jul 2007].
The expanded program on immunization was carried out in cooperation
with the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health
Organization (WHO) following the detection of fresh wild polio virus
in a 2-and-a-half-year-old boy in Maungtaw township, western coastal
Rakhine state on [19 Apr 2007] this year.
The wild polio virus was spread from neighboring countries according
to an examination result of the WHO lab, earlier reports said.
Long-term cooperation is being made between Myanmar and Bangladesh,
one of the neighboring countries bordering Myanmar's Maungtaw.
Meanwhile, a UN delegation, led by Dr. Julian Bilous, Senior Adviser
of the Polio Eradication and EPI Immunization Vaccine and Biological
of WHO, and Dr. Tadashi Yasuda, Acting Chief of UNICEF, visited
Myanmar in May 2007 to discuss with the officials of the Ministry of
Health the prevention measures.
The last round of the campaign, conducted from [9-13 Jun 2007],
covered 82 townships in Rakhine, Ayeyawaddy, Magway, Bago and Chin
states and divisions.
So far, 8 of the children have been confirmed with wild polio virus,
the report said.
In May 2006, a highly infectious polio, caused by a virus like
wild-type polio virus, was suspected in northern Myanmar's Pyin Oo
Lwin township, creating a threat for a likely recurrence of the
disease in the polio-free Southeast Asian nation already recognized
by a regional committee 4 years ago. [This case was subsequently not
confirmed and was never officially reported; see prior PRO/MBDS
posting Poliomyelitis - Myanmar: RFI 20070426.1358 - Mod.MPP].
The country selected the township as a central venue for launching
its biannual national immunization activities in September and
October in the year [2006] giving oral polio vaccination to children
under 5 in 80 townships surrounding Pyin Oo Lwin with the cooperation
of the 2 UN organizations as well as the Japanese embassy and
non-governmental organizations.
More than 2 million children in the 80 townships scattered in
Mandalay, Magway, Sagaing, Shan and Kachin divisions and states were
then covered.
The Myanmar health authorities have stressed the importance to
continue working towards a polio-free country despite enjoying the
status since 2003.
The country has so far vaccinated at least 95 percent of the children
under 5, the authorities claimed.
The last case of wild polio was reported in Myanmar in 2000.

[The above newswire mentions there have been 8 cases of polio
confirmed in this present importation-related outbreak in Myanmar. In
fact, according to the polio eradication website, as of 3 Jul 2007,
there have been 10 cases of polio confirmed since the start of this
outbreak, with the most recent date of onset of confirmed cases being
12 May 2007 (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>). In
the prior ProMED-mail posting (Poliomyelitis - worldwide (04):
Myanmar, Bangladesh, RFI 20070522.1648), there had been 7 confirmed
cases, representing an increase of 3 cases confirmed since the last posting.

As of 3 Jul 2007, 8 new cases were reported in the past week (one
WPV1 and 7 WPV3s), bringing the total to 90 for 2007. The most recent
case had onset of paralysis on 24 May [2007]. Subnational
Immunization Days (SNIDs) are currently ongoing (launched on [1 Jul

(mOPV1 and mOPV3).

[As of 3 Jul 2007, there have been 90 cases of polio associated with
wild poliovirus (WPV) infections in India, compared with 73 cases
reported during the same period in 2006, suggesting there is
increased activity in India this year. Of interest is that both WPV
types 1 and 3 have been responsible for cases this year.
Conclusions of the India Expert Advisory Committee on Polio
Eradication meeting held on 29-30 May 2007 are available at
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/meetings/17thIEAG_May2007.pdf>.
In that document, there is mention that as of the date of the meeting
(29 May 2007), there had been 64 cases of WPV associated polio
confirmed in India, of which 30 were associated with WPV type 1
infection, and 34 cases were associated with WPV type 3 infection. Of
note, all of the WPV type 3 associated cases were from Uttar Pradesh
(UP), coming from 9 districts in western UP and 2 neighboring
districts in Uttarakhand, whereas WPV type 1 cases had occurred in 23
districts in 7 states.

Advance notification of one new case was received from Nangarhar
province in the northeast of the country, close to the border with

[According to the polio eradication website, as of 3 Jul 2007, there
have been a total of 3 cases of WPV type 1 associated polio reported
in Afghanistan since January 2007, with the date of most recent onset
being 26 May 2007. Given the ongoing civil unrest in Afghanistan, it
is possible that there are additional cases that have not as yet come
to the attention of the official health sector. Afghanistan is one of
the few remaining countries considered to be polio endemic, along
with India, Pakistan and Nigeria.

Khyber Pass is located, and borders with the North West Frontier
Province (NWFP) of Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

As of 3 Jul 2007, one new case was reported in the past week (WPV1),
from Kebbi state, bringing the total to 115 for 2007. The most recent
case had onset of paralysis on 15 May [2007]. Immunization Plus Days
(IPDs) were held last week (23-26 Jun [2007]), covering critical
areas in the north of the country. 20 consultants from EMRO had been
dispatched to support the activity. While improvements were noted,
particularly in increased use of community dialogues and increasing
work with Quranic schools, key operational challenges must still be
addressed, including more effective microplans and ensuring better
vaccinator/supervisor training. The next IPDs will be held on 27-29 Jul [2007].

[According to the polio eradication website, as of 3 Jul 2007, there
have been a total of 115 cases of WPV associated polio reported in
Nigeria since January 2007, of which the date of most recent onset is
12 May 2007 for WPV type 1, and 15 May 2007 for WPV type 3. It should
be noted that for the same period in 2006, there had been 526 cases
reported. Hence, there appears to be a significant decrease in polio
activity in Nigeria this year 2007. In the June 2007 monthly
situation report (available at:
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/current_monthly_sitrep.asp>),
there was mention of a case of WPV reported from Rivers State in the
south of Nigeria, the 1st case reported from the south of the country
since August 2005. Genetic sequencing of the WPV 3 isolate
responsible for this case in Rivers State confirmed it was an
importation from the north of the country.

state is in the south of the country on the Gulf of Guinea. - Mod.MPP]
