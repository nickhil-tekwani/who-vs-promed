Infection with _Shigella sonnei_ that is resistant to antibiotics commonly
used in pediatric practice has become more common during the past decade
(1). In 2005, Kansas, Kentucky, and Missouri reported increases in
shigellosis cases associated with day care centers caused predominantly by
multidrug-resistant (MDR) (i.e., resistant to ampicillin and
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [TMP/SMX]) strains of _S. sonnei_.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns for isolates from Kansas
and Missouri were similar, suggesting a common outbreak in the Kansas City
area, whereas isolates from Kentucky had a different pattern. This report
describes the investigation of 2 outbreaks of MDR shigellosis associated
with day care centers and reviews measures for prevention and control of
_S. sonnei_ infection in these settings. Given the current rates of
resistance to antibiotics available to treat children with shigellosis
safely, public health measures initiated during shigellosis outbreaks
should focus on promoting appropriate handwashing and diapering practices
in day care centers.
Shigellosis is a reportable disease in all 3 states. A confirmed case is
defined as illness in a person with _S. sonnei_ isolated from a clinical
specimen, and a probable case is defined as clinically compatible symptoms
in a person who was epidemiologically linked to a confirmed case.
Case Reports
--------
Kansas City Metropolitan Area (Kansas). During 1 May - 31 Dec 2005, a
total of 201 confirmed _S. sonnei_ infections were reported among residents
of the Kansas City Metropolitan Area (Kansas) (Figure 1 [for figure, see
original URL - Mod.LL]). Median age of patients was 7 years (range: 1-70
years). Among patients aged less than 10 years, 66 (51 percent) were
female; among patients aged more than 18 years, 41 (80 percent) were
female. Information about patient exposures to day care settings was not
collected. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment Laboratory
conducted antimicrobial susceptibility testing on 60 isolates; 53 (88
percent) isolates were resistant to both ampicillin and TMP/SMX, 8 (13
percent) were resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, and none were resistant to
ceftriaxone, gentamicin, or ciprofloxacin.
Kansas City Metropolitan Area (Missouri).
-------------------------
During 1 May - 31 Dec 2005, a total of 645 confirmed and 85 probable
shigellosis cases in the Kansas City Metropolitan Area (Missouri) were
reported to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (Figure 1
[ for figure, see original URL - Mod.LL]). The median age of patients was 6
years (range: 0-67 years). Overall, 532 (74.0 percent) infections occurred
among children aged less than 10 years; 255 (48 percent) were among
females. Among 157 patients aged more than 18 years, 117 (74.5 percent)
were female.
A total of 42 licensed day care centers each had 1 or more cases of
shigellosis among attendees. Routine surveillance data indicated that 36
percent of patients or one of their household members had attended a day
care center; however, a random sample of 10 patients who were reinterviewed
indicated that an estimated 82 percent of patients or 1 of their household
members might have had exposure to a day care center. Antibiotic
susceptibility testing of 28 isolates was performed by the National
Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) Laboratory; 25 (89
percent) were resistant to ampicillin and TMP/SMX. No resistance to
ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, or nalidixic acid was observed.
Kentucky. During 1 May - 31 Aug 2005, a total of 148 confirmed cases of _S.
sonnei_ infection were reported in Fayette County (Figure 2 [for figure,
see original URL - Mod.LL]), which represented a 42-fold increase above the
previous 5-year baseline. The median age of patients was 4 years (range:
0-61 years); among children aged less than 10 years, 59 (50 percent) were
female.
Among adults aged more than 18 years, 18 (78 percent) were female. A total
of 137 (93 percent) cases occurred among attendees, their family members,
or staff at 16 day care centers in Fayette County. 12 isolates underwent
antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the University of Kentucky; all
were resistant to ampicillin and TMP/SMX, and none were resistant to
ceftriaxone or ciprofloxacin.
Control Measures
------------
In all 3 states, local public health agencies conducted case investigations
and met with day care center staff to promote handwashing and observe
diapering and food preparation practices. In Kansas, local public health
agencies used Glo-Germ (DMA International; Moab, Utah) kits to educate
students and staff about proper handwashing techniques. All 3 states
require exclusion of children with shigellosis from day care centers until
documentation indicates no _S. sonnei_ in 2 consecutive stool cultures
obtained more than 24 hours apart and greater than 24 hours after
completing antibiotic treatment. In Kentucky, 4 day care centers
voluntarily stopped accepting new admissions for 1 week to protect new
enrollees in day care centers that experienced ongoing transmission despite
intensive measures to modify and monitor hygiene practices.
From the earliest stages of the outbreaks, public health alerts describing
the outbreak, providing information about shigellosis, and promoting
handwashing were distributed to day care centers, schools, and the general
public in affected counties in fliers (e.g., distributed through
retailers), letters, and press releases. Health-care providers in all 3
states were informed of local _S. sonnei_ antibiotic-resistance patterns
and advised to test and treat patients with shigellosis with appropriate
antibiotics during the outbreak.
Despite the early implementation of these measures, the outbreaks persisted
for several months, lasting through the summer in Kentucky and into early
winter in Kansas and Missouri.

Editorial Note:
---------
In the USA, _Shigella_ species cause an estimated 450 000 cases of
gastroenteritis each year (2), mostly among children aged less than 5
years. _S. sonnei_ is the most common species of laboratory-confirmed
Shigella infection in the USA and usually causes an acute, self-limited,
diarrheal illness (3).
During the past 2 decades, numerous outbreaks of _S. sonnei_ infection have
been associated with day care centers (4). Because few bacteria are
required to transmit shigellosis from person to person through the
fecal-oral route, shigellosis can propagate in settings with insufficient
hygiene practices. Certain states, including the 3 states in this report,
require that children with shigellosis be excluded from day care centers
until documentation indicates that they have submitted 2 consecutive stool
specimens that do not yield _S. sonnei_; however, whether excluding
children until stool cultures do not yield Shigella bacteria reduces
transmission is unclear. As a result, the control of shigellosis outbreaks
associated with day care centers often requires considerable time, effort,
and expense from health departments, day care centers, and affected families.
Although antibiotics are not required for this generally mild disease, they
are often prescribed to shorten the duration of illness and reduce the
infectious period, particularly in day care center attendees and food
handlers (5).
Surveillance data for antimicrobial resistance among all _S. sonnei_
isolates received by NARMS during 1999-2003 indicated that 80 percent of
the isolates were resistant to ampicillin and 47 percent to TMP/SMX; 38
percent were resistant to both drugs (6). In the 2 outbreaks described in
this report, resistance to both ampicillin and TMP/SMX was 89 percent,
complicating shigellosis treatment in these communities.
Although ampicillin and TMP/SMX have been the drugs of choice for treatment
of shigellosis, current resistance patterns limit the use of these
antibiotics. Fluoroquinolones are an effective alternative for adults but
are not approved by the FDA for shigellosis treatment in children aged less
than 18 years. Macrolides, particularly azithromycin, also are recommended
by the American Academy of Pediatrics for treatment of shigellosis,
although data about clinical effectiveness are limited, and no standardized
guidelines for monitoring azithromycin resistance among shigellae are
currently available (7). In addition, azithromycin is excreted in stool
over an extended period. Follow-up stool cultures will not yield accurate
results until azithromycin is no longer being excreted; therefore, the time
required for follow-up testing might be prolonged (8).
The emergence of MDR shigellosis highlights the importance of prevention
and rapid control of outbreaks. Appropriate handwashing and diapering
practices are critical in minimizing the transmission of shigellosis in day
care centers (9). Scheduling handwashing sessions on arrival at the day
care center, before meals, or after playing outdoors; supervising
handwashing among young children; and eliminating water play areas have
been used to reduce the spread of shigellosis within day care centers and
to the community (10). Forming cohorts of convalescing children (e.g.,
asymptomatic children who are culture-positive), by allowing them to attend
the day care center but excluding them from interacting with other well
children, also has been used to control outbreaks associated with day care
centers; however, state regulations in these three states do not allow such
measures. Given the current rates of resistance to ampicillin and TMP/SMX,
the uncertain safety of administering fluoroquinolones to children, the
difficulties in monitoring azithromycin resistance, the absence of an
appropriate vaccine, and the unclear benefits of exclusion policies in day
care centers, public health measures should focus on prevention of
shigellosis outbreaks through appropriate hygiene practices and, where
possible and allowed by state regulations, forming cohorts of convalescing
children in day care centers.
