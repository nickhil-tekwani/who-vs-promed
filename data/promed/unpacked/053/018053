A thousand dead migratory birds found "beaks-down" in an Illinois farm
field prompted an investigation into what killed them, state officials said
Monday.
Initially, the blackbirds were thought to have been killed last week by a
strong downdraft as they migrated across the flat, central Illinois farmland.
But the similar body position of the birds at the time of death -- on their
sides with their beaks pointed toward the ground -- indicated there might
be another cause, possibly man-made, said Joe Khayyat, a spokesman for the
state Department of Natural Resources.
"Occasionally, there are birds found dead in groups like this. It could be
weather-related, or it could be an illness that spread through the flock,"
he said.
A laboratory has been enlisted to determine the cause of death, which
should be known later this week, Khayyat said.
