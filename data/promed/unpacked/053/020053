Two more states--Iowa and Michigan--have reported _Cyclospora_ infections linked to Del Monte prepackaged vegetable trays, lifting the number of affected states to 4 and the illness total to 78, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a [15 Jun 2018] announcement.

In a related development, Del Monte Fresh Produce on [15 Jun 2018] announced a voluntary recall of vegetable trays sold at some retailers in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In a recall notice from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the company said the 6-ounce, 12-ounce, and 28-ounce vegetable trays contained fresh broccoli, cauliflower, celery sticks, carrots, and dill dip and have a best-if-enjoyed-by-date of Jun 17 or earlier.

The recalled products were distributed to Kwik Trip stores and 8 other chains, some of them grocery stores. In a separate update, the FDA said the company withdrew the 2 smaller-size trays from retail market locations on [8 Jun 2018], but customers may still have them in their homes.

Most of the cases are in Wisconsin (50) and Minnesota (23), which 1st reported their outbreak about a week ago. Iowa has reported 3 cases, and Michigan 2. The FDA noted that the 2 Michigan illnesses involve vegetable trays purchased in Wisconsin.

The CDC said that 4 outbreak patients have been hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported. All of the sick people became ill on or after [1 May 2018], and none reported a history of international travel, a known risk factor for contracting the disease. Symptoms of the illness, caused by the _Cyclospora cayetanensis_ parasite, include watery diarrhea, appetite loss, cramping, bloating, and fatigue.

Epidemiologic investigations have revealed that most sick people reported eating Del Monte vegetable trays when they started having symptoms, and most reported buying the trays at Kwik Trip/Kwik Star convenience stores. "The investigation is ongoing to determine if there is a common supplier of the vegetable trays to stores where ill people shopped," the CDC said.

Minnesota has also reported a separate _Cyclospora_ outbreak involving 17 people who ate at a Minnesota restaurant named Sonora Grill.

[The outbreak can be expected to spread to all states where the specific product -- said the 6-ounce, 12-ounce, and 28-ounce vegetable trays contained fresh broccoli, cauliflower, celery sticks, carrots, and dill dip -- have been sold.

This case illustrates the risk of widespread outbreaks due to few manufacturers of food products which are distributed over large areas. - Mod.EP
