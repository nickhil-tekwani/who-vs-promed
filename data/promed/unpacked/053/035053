Haemorrhagic fever Ebola virus resurfaced in the administrative region of Labe
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola virus disease has reappeared in the administrative region of Labe. After Popodara where it was confined a few weeks ago, Ebola enters in force in Mali where a patient who had the virus died last weekend [24-25 Jan 2015] and was in contact with a growing number of people, according to the public health department.

"For now, there is no change in the community because the contacts who came with the dead man showed no signs of the disease. It is the only death recorded here. But we continue to look for all contacts. For now, we have already listed 25 contacts; but others are reported in Lelouma," said Dr Fangamou Tomou, director of the public health department (DPS) of Mali.

Informed immediately of the presence of the cursed virus in Mali, in Dougountounny to be exact, the regional committee in place to fight Ebola, chaired by the governor of the region, Sadou Keita, was sent into the field. The Guinee News regional editorial board decided to go and meet with the residents who have to deal with this new Ebola outbreak. Fear and panic are rampant.

The regional director of Health in Labe, Dr Mamadou Bah Oudy, informs us of the travels of the man who carried the virus to Dougountounny. "This man is from Mali and came back from Liberia, where he unfortunately lost his wife [to Ebola?]. So he went through Labe to reach his village of Dougountounny (in the prefecture of Mali) with his 2 children plus a woman," he said.

In order to fight Ebola, urgent measures were immediately taken by the highest authority of the prefecture. "We told them that starting now, they had to stay at home for 21 days. We also decided to close the weekly markets and all schools located less than one kilometer from the village," said the prefect of Mali, Harouna Souare.

The governor of Labe tried to reassure the residents of Dougountounny and told them that they would not be abandoned. Some measures were already implemented and include hygiene kits provided by UNICEF in collaboration with the organized group of businessmen (GOHA), and will be sent to Dougountounny shortly.

[If confirmed, this would be a set-back for Mali, which was declared free of Ebola on 18 Jan 2015 after 42 days without a case following those resulting from the index case, which was also imported from Liberia. Let us hope that Mali's experience in dealing expeditiously with its other imported case and the resulting cases and contacts will enable it to nip this new outbreak in the bud. - Mod.JW
