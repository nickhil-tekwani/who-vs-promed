Outbreak of African Swine Fever in the Astrakhanskaya Oblast
------------------------------------------------------------
In the course of laboratory testing of the pathologic material
sampled from dead pigs in the backyards of villages Alekseevka and
Makovka, the Volodarskiy Rayon, village Tuzukley, the Kamyzyakskiy
Rayon and village Promyslovka, the Limanskiy Rayon of the
Astrakhanskaya Oblast, African swine fever virus (ASFV) genetic
material has been detected. A decision to impose quarantines on the
ASF-affected areas has been made.

[Though this seems to be the 1st laboratory confirmed ASF spread in
the Astrakhan oblast, north of the Caspian Sea, the virus has
probably been circulating there for some time. During the early
stages of ASF spread in the Caucasus, as early as 11 Aug 2008 and in
view of an outbreak reported from Orenburg, the press reported the
following (see archived 20080815.2539):

"Astrakhan veterinarians are already preparing for the possible
advance of the deadly disease, and local officials there have
increased security measures. The authorities are applying a radical
approach, appealing to the local population with the proposal, as a
matter of urgency, to slaughter their pigs and immediately consume
their meat." - Mod.AS]
