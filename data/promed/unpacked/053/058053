The Division of Wildlife Resources has found that a herd of bighorn sheep on Antelope Island [Utah] has somehow contracted a devastating respiratory disease and is dying off.

About 150 animals were counted among the herd last year [2018]. But KSL-TV reports biologists on [Wed 9 Jan 2019] flew over the island and found only 26 sheep left.

Division of Wildlife Resources spokesman Mark Hadley says, "This disease has taken all of the sheep," and there are no vaccinations or medications that can treat it.

Hadley says bighorn sheep contract the disease from domestic sheep and goats.

Hadley says the division is unsure how the disease got into the herd because there are no domestic sheep and goats on the island that officials are aware of.

The division is working with Utah State Parks to try to figure out how the sheep contracted the disease.

[Bighorn sheep pneumonia has traditionally been considered a multifactorial disease, caused by multiple pathogens. Due to their complexity, understanding multifactorial phenomena like this, usually require integrated and sustained research efforts. The absence of established and universal explanations for pneumonia outbreaks contributes to conflict among wildlife and livestock stakeholders over land use and management practices.

Bighorn sheep pneumonia web of causation may have an important environmental component. In recent years, die-offs of bighorn sheep in several locations suggests that the proximate cause of these events may be a shared environmental determinant.

However, recent evidence indicates that in northwestern USA there seems to be a pathogen implicated in bighorn sheep outbreaks, _Mycoplasma ovipneumoniae_, an exotic disease agent for North America, introduced by domestic ovids.
