Pueblo man reportedly dies of plague
-------------------------------------
A 66-year-old Pueblo man died this week from bubonic plague, the Pueblo
City/County Health Department announced on Fri 10 Dec 2004.
The man reportedly died Wed 8 Dec 2004 in a local hospital after being
infected while rabbit hunting recently in Park County. According to the
victim's son, his father was hunting near Breckenridge. He was hospitalized
on Mon 6 Dec 2004.
Local health department Director Chris Nevin-Woods said the man had an open
wound on one of his hands and probably was exposed while skinning an
infected rabbit that he had shot. She said more testing will be done on the
rabbit for plague.
The case was the 1st plague-related death in Colorado since 1999 and the
state's 3rd case in 2004. Since the 1st human case was reported in 1957,
Colorado has reported 50 cases with 8 fatalities. The state averages 2
cases per year.
In Colorado, plague-infected animals are most likely to be found in the
foothills and mountains. Most human cases occur in the summer and early
fall months.
John Pape, an epidemiologist who specializes in animal-related diseases
with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's Disease
Control and Environmental Epidemiology Division, explained: "When a rodent
becomes infected, the bacteria circulates in the blood. Fleas are infected
while feeding on the animal and can transmit the infection to other
warm-blooded animals, including humans. People also can be exposed through
contact with blood from infected animals.
"Plague is found throughout Colorado and cycles from year to year," Pape
said. "This summer, we saw an increase in plague activity around the state,
including 20 cats, which are highly susceptible to the disease."
Although plague is a serious illness, it can be readily treated with common
antibiotics if recognized early. People will have a very sudden onset of
high fever, fatigue and weakness, and a painful, swollen lymph node. The
swollen lymph node is usually under the armpit, in the groin area, or in
the neck.
Pape said that people can greatly reduce their risk of becoming infected
with plague by taking a few simple precautions, including avoiding contact
with sick rodents and rabbits. Hunters should use gloves when cleaning and
dressing rabbits and other game to avoid blood exposure. "Do not feed
rodents in picnic or campground areas, and never handle sick or dead
rodents. Leave your pets at home when visiting rural areas," Pape advised.
State and local health officials regularly monitor plague-prone areas. If
sick and dying rodents or other evidence of plague are observed, and a high
risk of transmission to humans is determined, affected areas may be
temporarily closed to protect the public and to implement control measures.
In recent years, Pueblo County bubonic plague outbreaks occurred in 2001
near Lake Pueblo and the southern edge of Pueblo West and, in 1998, near
South Park Elementary School, according to Chieftain reports. Officials
were alerted when prairie dog colony die-offs were reported.

[Fleas become infected upon feeding on the blood of a rodent suffering from
bacteremic infection. The bacteria are restricted to the alimentary tract
of the flea, where they multiply in the midgut. The bacteria form large
brown clumps that extend throughout the midgut, esophagus and
proventriculus, a valve-like chamber situated between the esophagus and the
midgut. The clumps increase in mass over a few days until the
proventriculus is blocked.
The "blocked" flea then feeds on blood, but the meal is unable to pass into
the stomach. The flea continues to attempt to feed, but as it futilely
sucks blood from the host, the blood meal, mixed with bacteria from the
foregut, is regurgitated into the mammal. As many as 24 000 bacilli may be
transmitted in a single attempted feeding (1).
Blockage of the flea, and thus efficient transmission of bacteria, has been
shown to be dependent on the _Y. pestis_ hemin storage locus (hms) (2).
Although originally identified as being responsible for binding and storage
of hemin (and Congo Red) in the outer membrane, the hms (+) phenotype
appears to be required for the hydrophobic surface properties of the
bacteria. _Y. pestis_ hms mutants are hydrophilic, not autoaggregating in
aqueous environments. The mutants are unable to colonize the proventriculus
and produce blockage, although they do colonize the midgut and produce the
large pigmented masses. Proventriculus blockage is temperature dependent
with temperature more than 30 C preventing the obstruction. The effect is
not due to differences in hms protein expression but rather
posttranslational stability (3). Since one hms protein possesses enzyme
activity similar to enzymes vital to the production of polysaccharides for
biofilms, it is possible that biofilm, rather than the hms proteins
directly, is responsible for the blockage (3).
