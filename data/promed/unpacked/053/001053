[This week there was a positive environmental sample for WPV1 (wild poliovirus type 1) identified in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Tribal Districts. Two weeks ago there was a positive environmental sample identified in Sindh, (Poliomyelitis update (12): global (cVDPV2, WPV1 ES) 20210624.8473119), 2 weeks prior to that, there were 2 positive environmental samples identified in Punjab and Khyber Pukhtunkhwa (Poliomyelitis update (09): global (WPV1 ES, cVDPV2 AFP cases) RFI 20210611.8442001). Interpretation, the absence of AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases does not mean there has been interruption of WPV1 transmission in Pakistan. The presence of positive environmental samples means it hasn't occurred as yet, remembering that there is an average of 1 paralytic case for every 200 infected individuals. With respect to cVDPV's (circulating vaccine derived polioviruses), while the weekly reported cases seems to be decreasing, it is not clear that the outbreak transmissions have been interrupted, especially given the delays in confirmation announcements. Highlighting that, cases associated with cVDPVs continue to dominate over cases associated with WPV1.

A map showing the locations of each confirmed case of polio worldwide in the past 12 months can be found at: https://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/. One sees cases of cVDPV are in a band across Africa and in Afghanistan and Pakistan, cVDPV1 in Madagascar and Yemen, and WPV1 in Afghanistan and Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

https://dailypost.ng/2021/07/06/outbreak-of-new-polio-type-2-threatens-nigerias-free-status-nigerian-government/


The Federal Government has raised concerns over the recent outbreak of vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in some parts of the country, just 11 months after being declared free of Wild Polio Virus (WPV) by the Africa Regional Certification Commission for polio eradication (ARCC).

The government said at least 13 states and the Federal Capital Territory have reported the outbreak, including, Abia, Bayelsa, Borno, Delta, FCT, Jigawa, Kano, Kebbi, Lagos, Niger, Rivers, Sokoto, Yobe and Zamfara.

The National Primary Health Care Development Agency, NPHCDA revealed this during a review meeting of the Northern Traditional Leaders Committee on Primary Health Care.

The Executive Director of NPHCDA, Dr. Faisal Shuaib, has now warned that the continuous spread of this virus puts Nigeria's status as a Wild Polio Virus-free nation under threat. Dr. Faisal said the outbreak could have been the result of the large number of children missed during the COVID-19 outbreak response. "This year has been a challenging one due to the COVID-19 pandemic which has affected all areas of our lives including our immunization programme. There are cases of cVDPV2 in some states, hence the need for us as a country to jealously guard our WPV-free status and stop the cVDPV2 transmission in our communities. "We have conducted 4 OBRs [Outbreak Response] using the Novelle Oral Polio Vaccine which is a preferred choice as it doesn't seed the virus [nOPV2]. However, sub-optimal performance has been recorded in all the States due to high number of missed children during the OBR."

Dr. Faisal urged the traditional rulers to maintain their effort of mobilising people for the OBR campaigns and other subsequent rounds of polio vaccination. He asked the traditional leaders to join the call for improved funding of Polio Outbreak Response Campaigns, stressing that donor support in that regard has continued to dwindle. "It is pertinent to state that donor funding for polio has reduced drastically. We will therefore be relying on your influence in advocating to political leaders on the need to continue to fund Polio Outbreak Response campaigns. I also wish to humbly request for your continuous support in mobilising the people for the OBR campaigns and other subsequent rounds of the polio vaccination", he said.

Meanwhile, the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa'adu Abubakar, who spoke on behalf of other traditional rulers said though, certified WPV free, Nigeria's Routine Immunization coverage was still very poor while cases of maternal mortality were still unacceptably high in Northern communities. "It is true, Nigeria is certified Polio Free, however, the reality is Nigeria is not out of the woods as cases of CVDPV2 continue to spread even in states that have been polio-free for nearly 7 years. Added to this, is the scourge of COVID-19 and the challenges of educating our people to create demand and acceptance for vaccines."

[The "polio-free" status of Nigeria has been based on the interruption of WPV1 circulation and not cVDPV. Checking the records, the date of onset of most recent case of paralysis associated with cVDPV2 in Nigeria was 14 May 2021, hence it is premature to declare transmission interrupted. Note that Nigeria is one of the countries using the novel OPV2, which hopefully should reduce the likelihood of cVDPV2 cases occurring in the country. Time will tell.

Should the transmission of WPV1 be interrupted globally, one suspects the GPEI (Global Polio Eradication Initiative) and WHO, will revisit the definition of a polio-free world to address the cVDPV associated paralytic cases.
