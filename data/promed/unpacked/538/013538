[Re the request for additional information on the statement that the
veterinarian who put down the 2 smuggled birds in the quarantine zone
in Brussels airport "is sick in hospital with symptoms of avian
influenza".]
Please correct the information.
1. The veterinarian was not sick with flu-like symptoms, but actually
presented a bilateral conjunctivitis 3 days after having handled the
infected eagles. He has no other complaints and physical examination
was normal. He was [requested] to remain at home with oseltamivir as
prevention. Results from the tear swab were negative for H5 (see point
2 below).
Personal comment : if conjunctivitis was already described with H7
virus (1997 in the UK and 2003 in The Netherlands), to my knowledge
it was not a described symptom of H5 human infection, even in Hong
Kong in 1997. Nevertheless the [presentation] is similar in both cases.
This has to be investigated further.
2. Laboratory results from the division of Virology. Scientific Institute
of Public Health, Brussels (Belgium) (26 Oct 2004):
Swabs (2 nasal & 1 throat) from 23 persons (21 customs officers, the
Thai passenger and his brother) were performed on 24 Oct 2004.
Moreover, a tear swab was also collected from the customs officer
(veterinarian) who presented a bilateral conjunctivitis 3 days after
having handled the birds.
So far (26 Oct 2004 05.15 pm local time), 17 samples (including those
from the veterinarian and the Thai brothers) were tested for the
presence of influenza virus by 2 nested RT-PCR: types A and B, and H5
sub-type.
All results (including the tear swab) are negative for H5. One sample
from one healthy custom officer was weakly positive for type A. This
sample has to be tested again. This latter could be a false positive for
influenza A or a true influenza A virus belonging to another sub-type,
probably of human origin. 6 samples are still to be tested.

I send you the [above] in connection with the request for additional
information on the statement that the veterinarian who put down the 2
smuggled birds in the quarantine zone in Brussels airport "is sick in
hospital with symptoms of avian influenza", since I'm not sure that the
message Dr. Rene Snacken originally sent reached you via the e-mail
address he used.
