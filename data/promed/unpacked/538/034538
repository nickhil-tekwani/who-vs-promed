In connection with the increased threat of nodular dermatitis (lumpy skin disease) introduction and spread in the cattle population of the Russian Federation, there is a need to find effective, reliable and secure means to prevent the disease.

The reference laboratory for cattle diseases, subordinated to the Rosselkhoznadzor FGBU "Federal Center for Animal Health", has conducted pre-clinical and clinical studies of a tissue-culture, dry [freeze-dried?] vaccine against sheep pox, in terms of its safety and efficacy for cattle for the specific prevention of nodular dermatitis. The results of these studies showed no reversal of the vaccine strain to pathogenicity. Test showed it was harmless for cattle, providing high level of protection of the vaccinated livestock from infection with [Lumpy skin disease]. It should be noted that all the tests were conducted in accordance with OIE guidelines.

In March 2017, the registration name of the sheep pox vaccine has been amended, becoming "A tissue-culture, dry vaccine against sheep pox and nodular dermatitis of cattle".

The said vaccine is the only vaccine registered on the territory of the Russian Federation, and is officially recommended for the prevention of nodular dermatitis of cattle. There is a great demand for this drug, which has been widely applied, not only in the Russian Federation (Ryazan, Voronezh, Samara, Tambov, Rostov, Astrakhan region, Krasnodar region, The Republic of Karachay-Cherkessia, Kabardino-Balkaria, Kalmykia, etc.), but also in foreign countries, disadvantaged or threatened by nodular dermatitis of cattle (Islamic Republic of Iran, Republic of Mongolia, the Republic of Armenia, and others).

All livestock on the vaccinated farms vaccine has been found to be protected against the clinical manifestations of nodular dermatitis of cattle and of sheep pox [in sheep], without any post-vaccination complications.

[Sheep-pox vaccines have been applied in several countries to protect against LSD (which is, similarly, a capripox virus) since 1989. Some field observations addressed its comparison to the homologous live LSD vaccine (Neetling strain, South Africa).

For the recent assessment of LSD vaccines, please see 20160812.4410864, with detailed commentary. OIE's Manual chapter on LSD, including exhaustive updated information, is available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_LSD.pdf.

Details on the advance in developing an inactivated LSD vaccine in Europe, which reportedly was initiated in recent years, will be welcomed. - Mod.AS
