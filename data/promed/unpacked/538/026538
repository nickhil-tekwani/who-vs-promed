Dr Graham Rouch (Chief Health Officer), Department of Human Services, Victoria,
Australia wrote with regards to the serious Salmonella outbreaks that have
recently plagued the South Eastern states of Australia that:
"Despite the probable multifactorial dynamics of salmonellosis, distinct and
regular seasonal variation in endemic human salmonellosis occur in many
countries, including Australia, where we have a summer peak. Why?"
He also wrote "Victoria has recently experienced one of our hottest summers
on record. Might this have contributed to the outbreaks by "stressing"
animals prior to slaughter, resulting in a higher than usual pathogen load
on raw meat (to say nothing of the subsequent "cold chain" stress)?"
Having lived in both Victoria and Western Australia, I would like to comment
that temperatures in Western Australia (as opposed to Victoria) often remain
extremely high over prolonged periods in Summer months (sometimes an average
of 40 degrees celcius or more for a week at a time). I also believe that the
Australian national food authority is looking at Western Australia's food
monitoring techniques as being a model on which to base a national approach
to revised food monitoring.
Could it be that some factors other than "one of the hottest summers on
record" may have contributed to the outbreaks of Salmonella in food in Victoria?
If hot climatic conditions are directly correllated to Salmonella outbreaks
then surely Western Australia, where hot summers are the norm, should have
more serious outbreaks of Salmonella than Victoria and yet this doesn't seem
to be the case.
(Western Australia also has severe sudden hot spells where temperatures jump
suddenly to over 40 degrees celcius. Temperature changes arrive with sudden
ferocity so our livestock would also be subject to stress factors of sudden
increases in temperatures.)
