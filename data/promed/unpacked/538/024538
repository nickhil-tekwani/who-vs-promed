2001/060 - Citrus variegated chlorosis (_Xylella fastidiosa_) can be
transmitted through natural root grafts
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Citrus variegated chlorosis is caused by _Xylella fastidiosa_ (EPPO A1
quarantine pest). The bacterium can be spread over long distances by
infected nursery trees and is transmitted in orchards by insect vectors.
Studies in Brazil on the distribution of _X. fastidiosa_ within citrus
roots [showed that the bacterium can colonize root systems. [Moreover,
pot experiments with _Citrus sinensis_ (one inoculated and one
non-inoculated plant per pot) showed that _X. fastidiosa_ could be
transmitted between citrus plants through natural root grafts. This is the
first time that this mode of transmission has been reported. Further
studies are needed to evaluate the actual importance of transmission
through natural root grafts in the epidemiology of diseases caused by _X.
fastidiosa_ on its various host plants.

[The authors state that disease affects up to 40% of sweet orange trees in
Brazil, with consequent severe yield loss due to reduced fruit size. This
report presents a good example of a mode of virus spread not often
observed. The relatively high planting density (3 plants/m) used in
nurseries undoubtedly pre-disposed plants to form root grafts, thus
increasing the probability of virus spread via roots. Of great importance
is the need to determine if root grafts are associated with the spread of
diseases caused by other strains of _X. fastidiosa_ that cause coffee leaf
scorch in Brazil and of grapevine and plum in USA. - Mod.DH
