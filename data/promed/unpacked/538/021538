As of Wed 14 Dec 2005 a diagnosis of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome
(HFRS) has been confirmed in 50 inhabitants of the West Region of Kazakhstan.
HFRS is spread by rodents and has been reported from the Chyngirlausky,
Burlinsky, Terektinsky, and Zelenovsky Districts in the Regions of
Kazakhstan that adjoin the Orenburg Region [Oblast] of Russia.
A natural focus of HFRS was detected for the first time in the West Region
of Kazakhstan 2 years ago. At that time 27 people were reported to have
contracted HFRS. So far in 2005, 50 cases of HFRS have already been
confirmed. An outbreak of HFRS has been expected since August, because
favorable conditions for the multiplication of rodents have developed.
All the affected patients have been admitted to the Infectious Diseases
Hospital in Uralsk. The Regional Administration has allocate 26 million
Tenga [about USD 200 000 - Mod.CP] for rodent control and other disease
control measures.
