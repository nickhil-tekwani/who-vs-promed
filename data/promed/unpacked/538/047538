[Israel's report of 26 Nov 2007 on 3 outbreaks of Bluetongue in sheep
included the following information, "Identification of agent:
bluetongue virus". No specified BTV serotype(s) of the causative
agent were available at that stage (see in archived 20061128.3376).
The said notification has been recently updated, as can be seen in
the text currently available at the above URL. The main new
information is the following. - Mod.AS]

Causal agent: Bluetongue virus serotypes 4 and 15.
Nature of diagnosis: Suspicion, Clinical, Laboratory (basic),
Laboratory (advanced). ["advanced" has now been added. - Mod.AS]
Epidemiological comments:
Serological tests revealed high antibody titers against BTV.
In Yachini - Serotype 15
In Alon Hagalil and Elyaqim - Serotype 4
Diagnostic test results:
1. Viral Diagnosis Laboratory, Kimron Veterinary Institute [KVI],
Israel (National laboratory):
Species /Test /Test date / Result
Sheep /antibody detection - ELISA / 25 Nov 2006 / Positive
Sheep /pathogen isolation by egg inoculation / 5 Dec 2006 / Positive
Sheep / pathogen isolation on cell culture / 5 Dec 2006 / Positive
Sheep / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 5 Dec 2006 / Positive
Sheep / virus neutralisation test (VNT) / 21 Jan 2007 / Positive
2. Pirbright (OIE's Reference Laboratory)
Species /Test /Test date / Result
Sheep / virus sequencing / 19 Jan 2007 / Positive

[The identification of BTV-15 in Israel (at the Pirbright lab by
virus sequencing and at the KVI, Beit-Dagan by VNT), is a significant
and worrying development. In fact, this event complies with OIE's
definition of an emerging disease.
The case/fatality rate of affected sheep in Yakhini, caused by
BTV-15, was 52 percent.
BTV-15 has not been identified in Israel before. It has become the
6th BTV serotype isolated in Israel since 1950, and the 1st one to be
added since 1973. In view of the intensive BTV surveillance
activities undertaken in Israel since 1964, BTV-15's absence -- at
least throughout the said period -- can be stated with a high degree
of certainty.
The following 5 BTV serotypes are the ones identified in Israel
until/including 2005 (first year of identification in brackets):
BTV-4 (1950), BTV-10 (1965), BTV-16 (1966), BTV-6 (1972), and BTV-2
(1973). The most prevalent one is BTV-4.
The web-site of OIE's reference laboratory for Bluetongue at
Pirbright, UK (the Institute for Animal Health), presents a table
titled "The geographical distribution of different BTV serotypes";
see
<http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/dsRNA_virus_proteins/btv-serotype-distribution.htm>.
According to the information included in the said table, BTV-15 has
been recorded, so far, in the following regions of the world:
1. Virus isolations: Africa, Australia, China.
2. Serological evidence (detection of neutralising antibodies):
Middle East, Pakistan & India.
BTV-15 is the 2nd orbiviral, culicoides-borne disease introduced into
Israel for the 1st time during 2006. The other one is the Epizootic
Haemorrhagic Disease (EHD) virus, which has caused, between August
and December 2006, 112 outbreaks in bovines. Follow-up No.1/final
report can be accessed at OIE's WAHID data base
<http://www.oie.int/wahid-prod/public.php?page=single_report&pop=1&reportid=4445>.
The origin of those 2 emerging orbiviruses, and their possible
presence in other countries in the region, deserve investigative efforts.
According to South African data, no (live-attenuated) vaccine against
BTV-15 is currently available. See B. Dungu, T. Gerdes & T.
Smit (2004). The use of vaccination in the control of bluetongue in
southern Africa Veterinaria Italiana, 40 (4), 616-622. - Mod.AS]
