Farmer with Crimea-Congo fever dies
-----------------------------------
A farmer and professional hunter from Adelaide in the Eastern Cape
died on Thursday [4 Jul 2008] after having been diagnosed with
Crimea-Congo haemorrhagic fever, the health department said.

Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said the man, 39, died at the St Georges
hospital. "Following his diagnosis a health investigation team was
sent to Adelaide to see if anyone else was infected. "No one else was
diagnosed with the fever," he said. The man was admitted to hospital
on 12 Jul 2008.

The viral disease is transmitted to humans by ticks or contact with
blood or tissue from infected animals, and is potentially fatal.
Kupelo said the man was reportedly bitten by a tick on 3 Jul 2008,
and went to see a doctor 4 days later. Then, 3 days after that he
developed a range of typical fever symptoms including nausea,
vomiting, and joint pains.

The fever is the most common of a range of haemorrhagic fevers that
occurs in South Africa. According to the National Institute for
Communicable Diseases, anything between 5 and 25 cases are reported
each year, most of them in the Karoo, the Western Free State, the
Northern Cape and North West province. Most of the sufferers are
farmers, farm labourers, hunters or abattoir workers. Symptoms
include fever, aching muscles, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness,
headache, sore eyes, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, nose bleeding,
and other non-normal bleeding. According to the World Health
Organisation, one in 3 sufferers dies from the disease. There is no
safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use.
