[A summary of all lumpy skin disease (LSD) reports submitted by Greece to the OIE since the start of the epizootic on 18 Aug 2015 (so far causing 60 outbreaks), links to the follow-up reports, and an interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=18483. The spread of the vector-borne virus is expected to be put on (temporary?) hold when temperatures drop.

For the emergency vaccination of susceptible cattle within and around the affected region, the Greek veterinary services have opted to apply a freeze-dried, live attenuated virus (Neethling strain) vaccine manufactured in Ondestepoort, South Africa. A similar vaccine has recently been applied in Israel (see ProMED-mail post 20150926.3672096). As reported in an earlier posting (20150929.3676992), CODA-CERVA (Belgium) in partnership with the Pirbright laboratory (UK) are coordinating a project on the comparison of LSD vaccines. The project, reportedly, is planned to address 6 different vaccines, including live attenuated LSD vaccines, live attenuated sheeppox or goatpox vaccines, and newly developed inactivated vaccines. In view of the further spread of LSD in Greece and the extension of the vaccination since 2 Oct 2015 to cover also the entire Kavala Regional Unit, the significance of the mentioned vaccine comparison project is underlined.

Results of the vaccination with the "newly developed inactivated vaccines" are of particular interest. Subscribers are referred to the 2012 LSD review authored by Pirbright's experts (Ref 1), where (citing Kitching, 1983) they state: "The use of inactivated vaccines could be considered as a short term solution in an emergency; however, the protection provided by inactivated vaccines is not solid and is only short lived."
