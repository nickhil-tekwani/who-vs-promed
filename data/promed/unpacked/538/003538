EBOLA: FALSE ALARM IN FLIGHT
============================
Date: Fri 4 Apr 1997
From: Jack Woodall <woodall@wadsworth.org>

The object of posting the correspondence that follows is NOT to point the
finger at any one country, airport or airline, because it could have
happened to any of them. The
object is to point out the need for countries and airlines to establish --
rapidly -- procedures for handling a suspected case of Ebola, or other
transmissible disease emergency, in flight and on the ground.
It is necessary to arrange for, among other things:
- care of the patient on board while reducing the possibility of transmission
- rapid transfer procedures to a designated infectious disease hospital
onthe ground
- procedures for isolating and feeding passengers held on the ground, and
giving them facilities to communicate with their relatives.
After the Ebola case last year that was flown from Gabon to South Africa on
a regular scheduled flight, and the case of resistant TB who infected
passengers on another flight just last month, it is not a question any more
of whether those procedures will ever be needed -- they are needed NOW.
We would be happy to hear from any airport, airline or public health
authority about procedures now being implemented.

Re: Ebola scare in Australia.
I was on that flight Harare to Sydney. The way they handled the emergency
was terrible, considering the number or people and the nature of the case.
[But] There was no panic. People were relatively calm about the whole
situation and there was no mention on board the plane of Ebola.
Medical staff were very slow to respond to the situation and were not
waiting for the plane when we touched down. We were all forced to wait and
watch this woman who was obviously in a lot of discomfort. It took approx.
45 minutes after touchdown before medical staff moved this woman off the
aircraft and the rest of the passengers were forced to wait and hope.
We were given nothing except peanuts and we hadn't eaten in hours. We were
then informed that we couldn't fly on to Sydney because of the curfew at
Sydney airport, and they left us sitting in the airport and then in the
terminal. We spent at least 9 hours in Perth and Qantas didn't even put us
up in a hotel. They eventually organised to get us some food, and they
finally gave us phonecards to call the people who we had organised to meet
us at Sydney airport.
The staff at Sydney airport were not available to inform waiting friends
and relatives of the difficulties we had encountered.
Staff handled the situation reasonably well in the beginning, however, I
would not like to be put through such a situation again.
