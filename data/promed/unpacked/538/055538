"There is indeed a 2nd outbreak of [classical] swine fever in a pig
farm in the south-eastern town of Elhovo. 56 animals have been
slaughtered," national veterinary service director Zheko Baychev told
AFP.
This is the 2nd case of swine fever detected in southeastern Bulgaria
in a month. In early February 2006, authorities slaughtered some 70
pigs at a breeding farm in the village of Malko Sharkovo after an
outbreak of the disease.
Swine fever is a contagious pig disease but does not affect other
animal species or people.

[Bulgaria's notification of Classical Swine fever (CSF) in backyard
pig farms in the village of Malko Sharkovo, situated in the province
of Yambol, was sent to the OIE on 7 Feb 2006 (see
<http://oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_32.HTM#Sec7>). The virus seems to
be circulating in the wild boar population, from which occasional
infiltration into domestic pig farms may take place. - Mod.AS]
