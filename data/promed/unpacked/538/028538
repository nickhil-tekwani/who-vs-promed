KERALA WILT, COCONUT PALM - INDIA: UPDATE

The productivity in the traditional States, particularly in States
like Kerala and Karnataka, is lower than the national average,
according to a top official of Coconut Development Board. In order to
make the domestic coconut industry globally competitive, it is
necessary to enhance the current productivity level of coconut to a
considerable level, he said.
There are about 5 million coconut holdings in the country and 70
percent of them are in Kerala. Organised large-scale plantations are
completely absent in India. Most of the coconut holdings in the
country are too small to adopt scientific management and practise
subsistence farming only. The continued coconut growing on the same
land has depleted the soil. It is estimated that nearly 25 percent of
the coconut plantations in traditional coconut growing States are
senile, yielding less than 10 nuts per palm a year.
It has been estimated that about 37.19 lakh [3.72 million] palms in
Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Ernakulam, and Kottayam districts
of Kerala are yielding less than 10 nuts per palm on account of root
wilt disease [Kerala wilt] and hence need total removal and
replanting. In addition, about 21 lakh [2.1 million] plants planted
in these districts, affected by the disease, also require removal.
Coconut Development Board has chalked out a mega project for
replanting and rejuvenation of coconut groves in the traditional
States.
Financial assistance is provided for cutting and removal of old and
disease-affected plants. The scheme is to be implemented in the
Eleventh Five Year Plan, according to the official.

[Kerala wilt (KW; also called coconut root wilt) is spreading in
India in parts of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Symptoms are only obvious in
palms that are more than 30 months old. The most consistent and
diagnostic symptom is the characteristic bending of the leaflets
called 'flaccidity'. In older palms, yellowing and marginal necrosis
of the older leaves also develops. Roots of diseased palms show
degenerated phloem, disorganisation of metaxylem and they eventually
rot. Inflorescence necrosis and abortion develops in some cases. The
disease is not lethal, but significantly reduces production. Fungal
leaf rot disease (due to a complex of species, see ProMED-mail post
no. 20071118.3734) is found as a secondary infection in many KW
affected palms.
Lace bug (_Stephanitis typica_) is a vector of KW, and the plant
hopper _Proutista moesta_ is a putative vector. There is no evidence
of seed transmission. Disease management relies on eradication of
diseased palms, improving the general conditions of coconut groves,
and replanting with resistant or tolerant varieties. Resistance
breeding programmes exploiting the genetics of disease escapees
identified in heavily affected areas are in progress.
A phytoplasma was shown to be the causal agent of KW. Based on high
frequency of nucleotide dissimilarity of this phytoplasma with other
coconut phytoplasmas, the KW phytoplasma is considered as a separate
taxonomic phytoplasma group and is an as yet unclassified species. KW
has only been reported in coconut palms, however, the KW phytoplasma
was successfully transmitted by dodder (_Cassytha filiformis_, a
parasitic vine) from diseased coconut palms to periwinkle
(_Catharanthus roseus_) plants causing chlorotic spots and premature
leaf abscission. This may point towards the possibility of herbaceous
weeds playing a role as reservoir hosts in disease epidemiology.
The production of 10 nuts per coconut palm per year has been adopted
as an acceptable limit for coconut groves. Palms bearing less are
considered uneconomical.
