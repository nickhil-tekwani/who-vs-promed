[The apparent morbidity rate of all 12 bluetongue [BT] outbreaks, as reported in the 3 reports submitted by Romania to the OIE during the current week, is 23 percent in cattle and 1.3 percent in sheep. The morbidity rate in cattle in the other Balkan countries affected this year [2014] by BTV serotype 4 was significantly lower, as follows:

Greece.
Total outbreaks = 271 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 37 179 / 1647 / 356 / 0 / 0
Goats / 7386 / 9 / 1 / 0 / 0
Cattle / 767 / 9 / 0 / 0 / 0
(Apparent morbidity rate: sheep 4.47 percent; cattle 1.17 percent)

Bulgaria
Total outbreaks = 154 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Goats / 2880 / 46 / 0 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 16 075 / 413 / 96 / 2 / 0
Cattle / 2168 / 107 / 0 / 0 / 0
(Apparent morbidity rate: sheep 2.56 percent; cattle 4.93 percent)

FY Macedonia:
Total outbreaks = 47 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Sheep / 9120 / 454 / 53 / 4 / 0
Cattle / 201 / 6 / 3 / 0 / 0
Sheep & goats / 339 / 29 / 4 / 0 / 0
Goats / 199 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0
(Apparent morbidity rate: sheep 4.98 percent; cattle 2.98 percent)

Most BT serotypes, encountered throughout the years in the Middle East, the Mediterranean basin and Europe caused clinical disease primarily in sheep. However, some serotypes caused serious disease in cattle: BTV-8 (primarily in northern and central Europe), BTV-24 and BTV-12 (in Israel).

Another orbivirus, epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) caused febrile cattle disease in Israel, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey, with clinical signs similar to bluetongue.

The serotyping results of the Romanian bluetongue virus are anticipated with great interest.

Romania is an active exporter of live cattle. According to the most recent data available in FAO's international trade statistics (FAOSTAT, 2011), cattle were exported from Romania to 23 countries, with significant quantities to the following ones (in brackets, number of exported live cattle during 2011):

Croatia (70 024)
Spain (47 642)
Italy (28 422)
Hungary (16 270)
Netherlands (14 050)
Syria (28 161)
Greece (12 106)
Jordan (9999)
Bosnia & Herzegovina (9203)

It will be interesting to note whether live cattle have been exported from Romania, particularly from the affected Buzau prefecture, during July/August 2014, and to which countries.

Some clinical signs, particularly teat lesions, in affected Buzau cattle can be seen in the following video clip https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqUxzIQrOfY (thanks to Sabin Zentis for bringing it to our attention). - Mod.AS
