New emaravirus infects coffee plants in Kona
--------------------------------------------
In January 2014, a farmer in the Captain Cook area of Kona sent some coffee (_Coffea arabica_) leaf samples to Dr Scot Nelson at the University of Hawaii College of Tropical Agriculture and Human Resources (UH-CTAHR).

The grower first noticed the symptomatic plants because no cherries were harvested from them. The leaves were covered with circular lesions about 5 mm in diameter. The berries had turned to "raisins", they were not harvested because they were small or deformed. The farmer had 2 locations with several symptomatic plants and [there were] some symptomatic plants across a fence at the neighboring farm.

[Under the electron microscope, the scientists] saw some virus-like particles that have a double-membrane structure similar to emaraviruses. A PCR test for emaravirus was positive. The sequence of the PCR product suggests it is a new virus species. No emaravirus has ever been reported to infect coffee.

Emaraviruses are transmitted by eriophyid mites, which can disperse on wind currents. If this virus is the causal agent, it has the potential to move through a field rather quickly. The disease [may not] kill any coffee trees, but it makes the berries unmarketable.

At this stage, [scientists] lack sufficient information regarding the following aspects of this disease:
- Genus and species name of the brevipalpus mites found on symptomatic leaves
- Host range of the virus (such as weeds) or the mites (the presumed vector)
- The name of the virus (it may be a new species)
- Threat to coffee plants (potential for yield loss)
- Mode of virus transmission or disease epidemiology
- Geographic distribution of the virus
[There are] not enough data to say this virus is the cause of the symptoms, but [they] think it is prudent to conduct some visual surveys and to remove any affected plants as soon as possible.

The symptomatic trees at the reporting farm have been destroyed. The farmer reports that symptoms were there for at least 6 years and the disease seems to spread very slowly.

[_Emaravirus_ (type species _European mountain ash ringspot-associated virus_) was accepted as a new genus in 2009. It is not yet assigned to a family or order.

Flat mites of genus _Brevipalpus_ are known to transmit plant viruses, such as _Citrus leprosis virus_. A disease of coffee was previously considered to be caused by a mite transmitted virus, Coffee ringspot virus, but this virus has not yet been recognised as a species by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV).
