The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has quarantined 4 Saskatchewan herds
and banned the movement of animals that originated in those herds. One
animal in each of the 4 herds has died from CWD. The CFIA has destroyed all
64 animals in one of the herds in order to gather tissue samples. It will
also kill 35 animals in a second infected herd. The agency does not plan to
exterminate all of the animals from the infected herds but neither has it
decided against total eradication, said CFIA veterinarian George Luterbach.
The Saskatchewan border has been closed to U.S. imports for about a decade,
but some animals were imported from South Dakota before 1990. Federal
veterinarians think one of these animals brought the disease into
Saskatchewan. There were 2 cases of CWD diagnosed in Saskatchewan elk herds
before this year. In 1996, an entire herd was destroyed after one of its
elk contracted the disease. In 1998 another animal was infected but this
time, authorities decided not to kill the entire herd. Instead, the
infected animal, its mother and its siblings were destroyed. Now CWD has
re-emerged in the same group of animals. [All 4 of the recently diagnosed
elk have ties to that herd. "All cases to date have a link with each
other," said Luterbach. All go back to an original infection from an
imported American elk.
