As of today [20 Nov], there have been a total of 448 cases and 121
deaths [case fatality rate (CFR) of 27 percent]. Due to communication
problems, no further cases were reported from the sentinel sites.
Insecticide spraying was carried out in the most-affected localities
of Dilling and Kadugli.
Vector control activities and entomological assessment
------------------------------------------------------
ULV (ultra-low) volume machines, fogging machines for space sprays, and Hudson
hand sprayer pumps for indoor residual spraying (IRS) have been in use to
control the adult mosquitoes in Dilling and Kadugli [see map at
<http://www.hf.uib.no/smi/sa/tan/Map3.gif>.
The IRS and spraying of the surrounding vegetation have repellent and
killing effects on feeding mosquitoes and on their resting behaviour.
No larviciding activities have been carried out in the state. Free
distribution of insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) is ongoing
in the affected areas with the priority for in-patient health
facilities. Nets have been distributed to the community through
hospitals in Kadugli, Dilling, Rashad and Abujibeha.
The elimination of water reservoirs in Kadugli town needs to be
looked into, as they are potential breeding sites for mosquitoes.
All vector control activities are implemented with the support of
UNMIS and UNICEF, and the NGOs FAR, SC-US, Medair, African Muslims,
and Pancare.
Vaccination campaign
------------------
The yellow fever vaccination campaign micro plan has been finalized
at the federal level while input from the state level is still
pending.
Inventory of cold chain equipment in all localities has been prepared
to facilitate smooth coordination of vaccine distribution.
Case management
----------
The NGOs Medair and MSF-France are directly involved in this
intervention component in Gulud and Abujibeha hospitals
(respectively) as well as the implementation of the vaccination
campaign. Further planning thus would not exclude other NGOs (SC-US,
IRC, FAR, etc.) from becoming active members.
Plan of action
--------------
- Provision of list of requirements for the implementation of vector
control activities.
- Conduct training in preparation of vaccination.
- Social mobilization of communities re: vaccination campaign.

[The previous report described the current YF outbreak of 404 cases and 118
deaths in South Kordofan State as of 16 Nov 2005 (see ref: 20051121.3387). The
tally grew considerably in the next 4 days. According to WHO and UNICEF,
necessary measures such as massive vaccination are being implemented. Many
NGOs have been mobilized to cope with the situation as well. - Mod.RY]
[This outbreak has been occurring since mid-October 2005, and according to
yesterday's report, YF vaccine will only arrive next week. If only somebody
had realised 6 weeks ago that acute hemorrhagic fever with jaundice and a high
CFR is not dengue, and that there had been a YF epidemic there in 1940, how
many lives might have been saved. I am well aware of the communication
difficulties in the area, having had to single-handedly push a 3-ton truck out
of the mud there the day before the roads closed for the wet season. I hope it
is not the rainy season now. - Mod.JW]
