My Swedish contacts appear to be on holiday at this time. As soon as I
hear back from them it will be posted. The original hypothesis that it
was from earth moving in the vicinity of an old anthrax grave is a
good starting position and not at all unlikely. This is the commonest
cause of reoccurrences on farms years after the last case in areas
without a present history of the disease. - Mod.MHJ]
