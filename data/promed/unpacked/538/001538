[Please note: In yesterday's (17 May 2020) update, there were typos in the China case numbers for 16 and 17 May 2020. I erroneously hit 9 rather than 8 and gave China 10 000 more cases than they actually had. This error has been corrected in our archives, but your email version has the original error.

[3] Extrapolation of Spanish serology results for CFRs
Date: Mon 18 May 2020
From: Steven Berger <steve@gideononline.com> [edited]


For several months, we have been inundated by reports summarizing incidence and mortality data for COVID-19, on both the national and global levels. In a previous ProMED post I cautioned that "reported cases" cannot be equated with "total cases" without inclusion of individuals with asymptomatic or subclinical infection that do not seek medical care. [1] If a large segment of the population is found to be seropositive, we might conclude that the true case-fatality ratio (CFR) of COVID-19 is lower than official data might suggest. A seroprevalence study reported this week seems to provide evidence that this is the case. [2]

A national survey of individuals identified IgG antibody toward SARS-CoV-2 in 5.0% of the general population of Spain. At the stated specificity of 100% and sensitivity of 98%, the true seropositivity may be estimated at 5.15%. Although factors which determine seroprevalence rates in Spain need not apply to other countries, the following chart extrapolates the potential impact of a 5.15% population seroprevalence on case-fatality data from high-incidence countries in the European Region, United States, and China. [3]

The impact of future SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence surveys will largely depend on the quality of the test itself, the duration of immunity and protective role of the antibody, possible emergence of newer strains of coronavirus, and other factors. In any event, additional seroprevalence data will play a key role in planning our response to this pandemic going forward.

Table. COVID-19 - Reported vs. Estimated cases

Country: Reported cases (% of population) / Reported deaths / CFR (%)* // Estimated cases** / Estimated CFR (%)***

Belgium: 55 280 (0.48) / 9052 / 16.4 // 596 548 / 1.52
China: 82 947 (0.0058) / 4634 / 5.6 // 74 125 174 / 0.0063
France: 179 569 (0.28) / 28 108 / 15.7 // 3 360 686 / 1.14
Germany: 176 651 (0.21) / 8049 / 4.6 // 4 313 197 / 0.19
Israel: 16 617 (0.19) / 272 / 1.6 // 444 866 / 0.061

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dan Silver for finding and translating this article. It provides a nice glimpse into how the provincial government of a province bordering on one country with known major COVID-19 activity (Russia) and another country with speculated COVID-19 activity (North Korea) is handling importation and local transmission of the SARS-CoV-2. In total, there have been 34, locally acquired COVID-19 cases in Jilin since 7 May 2020; a sizeable number in an almost 2 week period. Other countries that are beginning to lift lockdowns, should see how this has been done in China, and learn from them. Especially with respect to testing all contacts, looking for asymptomatic infections that may well contribute to transmission of the virus to others unknowingly and should be in isolation. - Mod.MPP

[5] Indigenous Amazon tribes

Date: Mon 18 May 2020

https://dailytimes.com.pk/614351/first-coronavirus-case-detected-in-ecuador-amazon-tribe/


The 1st case of the novel coronavirus [COVID-19] has been detected in one of Ecuador's indigenous Amazon tribes, the health ministry said Sunday [17 May 2020]. Waorani organizations -- speaking through the GO Alliance for Human Rights in Ecuador (DDHH) -- warned COVID-19's spread could be "catastrophic and highly lethal" for their community, which is vulnerable to diseases.

The 1st case reported in the Waorani tribe is a "pregnant woman, 17 years old, who began to show symptoms on [4 May 2020]," the ministry said in a statement. She was taken to a hospital in the capital Quito and placed in isolation, the statement said, without giving further details. The federal government -- in coordination with indigenous leaders -- checked on 40 people that the woman had come into contact within the Miwaguno community, which has 140 inhabitants. "17 citizens with a history of respiratory systems were found. To date, 6 of them have symptoms, so 20 rapid tests and a total of 7 nasopharyngeal swabs were performed," the health ministry said, without releasing the test results.

Ecuador, one of the hardest-hit countries in Latin America, is now in its 2nd month of lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus. It has reported some 33 000 cases and more than 2700 deaths.

[The Waorani have an estimated population of about 2000 and live in parts of Orellana, Napo, and Pastaza provinces of Ecuador. They were hunters and gatherers living in small clan groupings. Some groups have resisted contact and have moved deeper into the forests (https://www.amazonfrontlines.org/who/partners/waorani/).

Contact of indigenous populations in the Amazon region with the general population has produced fatal epidemics of measles and influenza to name a few in modern times and COVID-19 is a formidable disease. The distance from the health infrastructure of the countries is also a major contributor to increased morbidity and mortality. - Mod.MPP

- 537 COVID-19 cases and 102 deaths are being reported by 38 indigenous groups in Brazil. Most of the cases are in the remote Brazilian Amazon, where communities are located far from medical assistance. Experts, citing the vulnerability of indigenous peoples to outside disease, worry the pandemic could result in a many more deaths.

- In response to the pandemic, indigenous groups in Mato Grosso state have partnered with an NGO to produce a daily updated map monitoring COVID-19 outbreaks in urban areas near indigenous villages. The website is meant to keep indigenous people informed, and put pressure on national and international groups to respond.

Indigenous groups in Brazil are reeling from COVID-19 as infections and the death toll rise, with 540 cases and 103 deaths among 38 ethnic groups now reported by Brazil's Indigenous Peoples' Articulation (APIB). APIB says that the real numbers are likely much higher due to notification delays and underreporting.

Worst hit is Amazonas state which has recorded 78 indigenous deaths, and its capital, the rainforest metropolis Manaus, where officials say the health system has collapsed. Messias Kokama, leader of Parque das Tribos, an indigenous community on the outskirts of Manaus was buried last week. Now, the disease is spreading into the vast state's far-flung and underserved interior towns, further endangering indigenous communities.

So far, Brazil is the hardest hit country by COVID-19 in South America. Cases are increasing by 10-15 000 per day and as of Monday [18 May 2020] there had been more than 16 000 deaths. Meanwhile, reports suggest loggers, illegal miners and land grabbers may be taking advantage of the chaos brought by COVID-19, invading indigenous lands, amid falling environmental oversight.

COVID-19 mapping in Mato Grosso
-------------------------------
In response to the pandemic, indigenous groups in Mato Grosso state in Brazil's agribusiness heartland have partnered with a local NGO to produce a map that monitors COVID-19's spread in towns and cities close to indigenous communities. The online COVID-19 map comes as local advocacy groups in Mato Grosso condemn regulatory attacks on indigenous land rights by both state and federal governments. The digital map (https://www.icv.org.br/covidforadasaldeias/) -- developed by NGO Life Centre Institute (ICV) in partnership with Mato Grosso's Indigenous Peoples Federation (FEPOIMT) -- provides daily updates of the number of COVID-19 cases near indigenous lands. "It's a very valuable initiative," Crisanto Xavante, president of FEPOIMT, said of the map. "This virus is the invisible enemy of mankind."

Crisanto told Mongabay that as well as alerting communities to the encroaching danger of the virus, the map also serves as a tool with which to appeal to authorities and organizations to provide more resources. "We know from experience that we are not a priority of the government," Xavante said.

Many indigenous people in Mato Grosso, and across Brazil, make regular trips to the nearest town or city to buy food and other supplies or to collect government benefits, increasing infection risk. The 1st case of indigenous infection in Mato Grosso was recorded last weekend [16-17 May 2020], with a tribeswoman from the Xavante ethnic group hospitalized. According to the digital map, dozens of cases have been confirmed in cities that border indigenous lands.

Several cases have been recorded in towns near the 26 000 square kilometer (10 039 square mile) Xingu National Park reserve, where savanna meets Amazon rainforest, home to 6000 indigenous people from 16 different groups. There, villages have been in lockdown since late March [2020] which has complicated traditional community agricultural cycles, as tools and supplies have been harder to access, leaders said. "We know that the danger is getting closer," Ianukula Kaiabi Suia, president of the Xingu Indigenous Land Association (ATIX) told Mongabay.

"What concerns us is that the state doesn't have sufficient [healthcare] infrastructure," he added, noting that the majority of Mato Grosso's intensive care beds are located in the capital Cuiaba, over 500 kilometers (310 miles) distant.

Mato Grosso is home to around 50 000 indigenous people from 43 different groups, the 6th biggest indigenous population in Brazil's 27 states, according to the country's geography and statistics institute (IBGE).

[The Brazilian indigenous tribes have been significantly affected by COVID-19 -- with 537 cases and 102 deaths (reported case fatality rate of 19.0%). The total size of the indigenous communities in Mato Grosso state is approximately 50 000. In more precarious state are the indigenous groups in Amazonas. The report above mentions that the infrastructure in Manaus (the capital of Amazonas) has collapsed under the COVID-19 pandemic (see COVID-19 update (164): global, contact tracing, Amazon (Peru,Brazil), WHO 20200508.731257 for details of Amazonian cities in Brazil and Peru). The toll of this pandemic will be felt by the entire globe... - Mod.MPP

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 10:00 CEST, 18 May 2020.

Highlights
----------
- The 73rd World Health Assembly (https://www.who.int/about/governance/world-health-assembly/seventy-third-world-health-assembly) which opened today [18 May 2020], will focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. Member States will deliver statements, report their progress in fighting the coronavirus, share knowledge on the evolving situation, and consider a draft resolution on COVID-19. It is available live online in Arabic, Chinese, Russian, English, French, and Spanish (https://player.4am.ch/who/20200518-19_wha73/player.html?lang=en).

- WHO has signed an agreement with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to work together to promote health through sport and physical activity. The agreement has a special focus on preventing non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This collaboration is timely because the current COVID-19 pandemic is particularly affecting people with NCDs (https://www.olympic.org/news/ioc-and-who-strengthen-ties-to-advocate-healthy-lifestyles).

- Flooding in Somalia has raised concerns of an upsurge in cholera cases as the country deals with a growing number of COVID-19cases. WHO's country office has sent urgently needed essential medical supplies, however funding for humanitarian operations in Somalia remains very low (http://www.emro.who.int/somalia/news/somalia-deals-with-flooding-in-the-midst-of-the-covid-19-outbreak-raising-concern-about-an-upsurge-in-cholera-cases.html).

- Sony Music Latin and Global Citizen have released a new "Color Esperanza" track with proceeds benefiting the Pan American Health Organization(PAHO) -- WHO's Regional Office for the Americas -- and its COVID-19 relief efforts throughout the Americas (https://www.paho.org/en/news/17-5-2020-sony-music-latin-and-global-citizen-release-new-color-esperanza-track-benefit-pahos).

- WHO has cautioned against recommending or administering unproven treatments to patients with COVID-19. In the 'subject in focus' below, we highlight how the WHO Solidarity Trial is helping find an effective treatment for COVID-19.

Subject in focus: accelerating a treatment with the Solidarity Trial
--------------------------------------------------------------------
While the research for an effective treatment continues, until there is sufficient evidence, WHO has cautioned against recommending or administering unproven treatments to patients with COVID-19 or people self-medicating with them. The consensus among world experts is that potential exists but that far more studies are urgently needed to determine if existing anti-viral drugs can be effective to treat COVID-19. If these treatments prove to be effective, they could reduce the burden of COVID-19.

In order to fast-track this research, WHO launched the Solidarity Trial on [18 Mar 2020] -- a large international clinical trial to help find an effective treatment for COVID-19. Enrolling patients in one single randomized trial will help facilitate the rapid worldwide comparison of candidate treatments and overcome the risk of multiple small trials not generating the strong evidence needed to determine the relative effectiveness of potential treatments.

Initially, the Solidarity Trial will compare 4 treatment options against the standard of care, based on evidence from laboratory, animal, and clinical studies. These include: chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon beta-1a. By enrolling patients in multiple countries, the Solidarity Trial aims to rapidly discover whether any of these existing drugs slow disease progression or improve survival. The primary outcome measurement is all-cause mortality, subdivided by severity of disease at the time of randomisation. The major secondary outcomes are duration of hospital stay and time to first receiving ventilation (or intensive care).

The Solidarity Trial is unlike any other clinical trial and its objective will be achieved through new ways of working that embrace:
- Speed to act fast now, to simplify procedures with a simple randomized control clinical trial protocol and a paperless / web-based randomization and data system allowing for rapid centralized analyses. The adaptive study design allows for quickly adding novel treatment arms while the trial is in progress or discontinuing some treatment arms that are proven ineffective or unsafe.

- Scale by prioritizing counties at highest risk and hospitals that have the most number of adults (age greater than or equal to 18 years) in hospital with definite COVID-19 symptoms and no contra-indication to any of the study drugs; this approach ensures the greatest level of enrolment.

- Access by ensuring all countries can join the Solidarity Trial and receive WHO technical and financial support including access to all trial drugs free-of-charge, thanks to donations that WHO negotiated with 5 manufacturers.

Since its launch, over 100 countries have expressed an interest in participating in the Solidarity Trial, and WHO is actively engaged with more than 60. The engagement involves multiple steps to support countries. Some of these steps include ethical and regulatory approvals of the WHO core protocol; the identification of hospitals that will participate in the trial; the training of hospital clinicians in the web-based randomization and data system; and shipping the trial drugs as requested by each participating country.

To date, 18 countries from 5 out of the 6 WHO regions and representing 3 out of the 4 World Bank income groups have started the Solidarity Trial. These 18 countries represent over 245 hospitals with 885 clinicians involved. Patient enrollment is nearing 3000.

By the end of May [2020], we expect another 10-12 countries to start the Solidarity Trial. At that point, we anticipate that an interim trial analysis will be produced and will be monitored by a global Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), an independent group of experts.

Further updates on the Solidarity Trial will continue to be made available from this dedicated WHO webpage (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. This includes 19 countries (including 4 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 61 countries (including 7 territories) from the European region, 10 countries from the South-East Asia region, 22 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 54 countries (including 19 territories) from the Americas region, and 49 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 50 879 new cases (54.5% of the global newly reported cases), and 2810 deaths (63.1%) for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 44.8% were reported by the USA, followed by Brazil 29.3%, Peru 8.0%, Chile 4.6%, Mexico 4.2%, and Canada 2.4%. The Americas region has surpassed 2 million cases and is maintaining its status as having the highest cumulative case count of the 6 WHO regions, with the European region as the 2nd-highest region.

The European region reported 19 922 new cases (21.3% of the global newly reported cases) and 1222 deaths (27.4%). Russia reported 44.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 17.7%, Turkey 6.9%, Belarus 4.9%, Italy 3.4%, and Spain 3.3%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 11 992 new cases (12.8% of the global newly reported cases) and 138 deaths (3.1%). Saudi Arabia reported 22.8% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Pakistan 16.5%, Iran at 15.1%, Qatar 13.6%, Kuwait 8.7%, and the United Arab Emirates at 6.1%.

The African region reported 2500 new cases (2.7% of the global newly reported cases) and 38 deaths (0.9%). South Africa reported 46.4% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Algeria at 7.9%, Nigeria 13.5%, Guinea-Bissau at 3.1%, Zambia at 3.0, and Guinea at 2.8%.

The Western Pacific region reported 969 new cases (1.0% of the global newly reported cases) and 13 deaths (0.3%). Singapore reported 70.4% of the newly reported cases, followed by the Philippines 21.5% and Malaysia 2.3%. Removing Singapore from the denominator has the Philippines at 72.5%, Malaysia at 7.7%, Japan at 7.0%, South Korea at 5.2%, and Australia at 3.1%.

The South-East Asia region reported 7062 new cases (7.6% of the global newly reported cases) and 231 deaths (5.2%). India reported 74.2% of newly reported cases, followed by Bangladesh 18.0% and Indonesia 6.9%. These 3 countries make up 99.2% of all reported cases in the region. Removing India from the denominator, Bangladesh represents 69.9% of the newly reported cases, Indonesia 26.9%, and Sri Lanka 1.2%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 18 May 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas is increasing, as is South-East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: It is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Johns Hopkins' CSSE or Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have, at times, significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Johns Hopkins CSSE or Worldometer table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
