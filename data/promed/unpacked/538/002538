Regarding the "deadly disease" of Ephemeral fever in the Philippines, this
is some additional and updated information. The disease is spectacular and
causes loss of production, but mortalities can be minimized with an
understanding of the pathogenesis and treatment.
The Virus - Bovine ephemeral fever (BEF) virus is an Ephemerovirus within
the family Rhabdoviridae. It has some close antigenic relatives that infect
cattle but do not cause symptoms, which can confuse serology, as there is
antigenic overlap.
Vectors - BEF virus has been isolated from 2 species of mosquito and at
least 2 species of _Culicoides_ spp. midges. However, regarding
pathogenesis and epidemiology in Australia, _Culicoides_ spp. are unlikely
to be of importance as vectors. The virus does not spread by contact or
through water or feed. There are no carriers.
Clinical Signs - The clinical signs are fever, depression, joint swelling ,
subcutaneous edema, and lacrimation, all proceeding from a generalized
inflammation. The gut stasis, loss of swallowing reflex, muscle twitching
or tremor, and acute paresis are due to hypocalcaemia and rise in plasma
pH. The longer-term paresis "downers" result from loss of myelin in the
upper cervical spinal cord. This paresis may continue after fever has
resolved and may last days, weeks, or occasionally permanently.
Treatment - Ephemeral fever is one of the rare viral diseases that can be
treated effectively. The primary inflammatory signs respond to
anti-inflammatory drugs. The signs can actually be completely prevented by
treatment for the expected course of the disease. The signs due to
hypocalcaemia respond to treatment with calcium borogluconate, as for milk
fever. The response is temporary unless concurrent treatment with
anti-inflammatory drugs is given. The neural lesions, which are uncommon,
do not respond to therapy. Good nursing with shade and water provided is
beneficial. Nothing should be forced down the throat, as the swallowing
reflex is often not functional. It can be restored by treatment with
calcium borogluconate. Rest is essential for full recovery whether or not
treatment is given. A draft animal should not be worked for 10-14 days
depending on the severity of the disease.
Immunity - A single attack confers lifetime immunity. However, there are
related viruses that can produce the same clinical signs.
Diagnosis - Usually there are animals in various stages of the disease from
early fever to complete recovery in a locality. Most diagnosis is on
clinical grounds. There is always a neutrophilia, which is unusual for a
viral disease, but will not distinguish it from Hemorrhagic septicaemia.
If uncoagulated blood is allowed to clot in a glass or plastic blood
bottle, the clot does not contract normally. This phenomenon persists from
the second day of fever to the second day of recovery. The clot is
surrounded by strands of creamy fibrin.
Virus isolation in _Aedes albopictus_ cells is the most reliable diagnostic
method. BEF virus should be identified with an IFA test using a specific
monoclonal antibody, as there are other rhabdoviruses infecting cattle in
SE Asia.
