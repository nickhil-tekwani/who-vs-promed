["Rabies is regarded as one of the world's most important zoonoses (diseases that are naturally transmissible from animals to humans). The occurrence of rabies in domestic dogs poses a threat to humans, and this is still a major concern in many developing countries. The disease can sometimes have economic consequences in some countries when it affects livestock (cattle, horses, small ruminants, etc.).

Vaccination of dogs is the preferred method of controlling and eliminating rabies worldwide. For epidemiological, ethical, and economic reasons, the culling of animals that are potential reservoirs cannot be considered as the 1st priority for control and eradication of rabies. All successful rabies eradication campaigns have included measures combining control and vaccination of stray dog populations and vaccination of all owned dogs.

Vaccination campaigns are set up with the aim of achieving coverage of around 70 [percent] of the canine population in a zone where rabies is endemic.

In wild animals, oral immunization using vaccine-containing baits has produced excellent results in some animal species (fox, raccoon, skunk, etc.) and has proved an effective solution to control, for instance, or even eradicate rabies in foxes in Western Europe. However, the cost is high." Source: OIE - Frequently Asked Questions on Rabies."
