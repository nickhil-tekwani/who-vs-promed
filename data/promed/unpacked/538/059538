In the trend survey of infectious diseases, 33 patients [with severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS)] have been reported so far, and the number of reported cases (including delayed reports) from the previous summary (28 Nov 2018) was 3 cases. The ratio between men and women was 192 to 204, and the median age at the time of notification was 74.0 years. Although there are many cases of onset in May to August, as in 2016, the number of reports tended to increase until October in 2018. It has been reported from 23 prefectures, mainly in western Japan in 2018; 4 of the patients diagnosed before the notification was requested in the infectious disease occurrence trend survey have not been reported.

(Note) Since the number of deaths is information available at the time of reporting the infectious disease occurrence trend survey, accurate number of deaths and calculated mortality rate can be higher, and in some cases it differs from published information by municipalities.

[The above data indicate that the number of cases in men and women is nearly equal, as are the case fatality rates by sex. Although there were cases in all age-groups, most were in the 60 to 80 years cohorts. There were cases every year from 2013 to 2018, but more cases occurred in 2017 and 2018. Cases were widely disbursed geographically in 2018, with 24 prefectures reporting infected individuals. It appears that SFTS virus is endemic in this general area, and the best way to avoid infection would be to avoid tick bites.

SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well, so the above numbers may be an underestimate of the total number of infections. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, but that appears to be a rare event. The virus is doubtless endemic in several countries in Asia, and cases have occurred previously in Japan. Apparently, there are 2 previously reported affected individuals who acquired their infections directly from an SFTS virus-infected cat. No mention was made of tick transmission in that instance. The possible route of transmission from the cat to the veterinarian and veterinary nurse via exposure to blood or other bodily fluids is not mentioned (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - East Asia (02): Japan (MZ) 20181211.6204927>).

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of a _Haemaphysalis longicornis_ tick, the SFTS vector, can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm. - Mod.TY
