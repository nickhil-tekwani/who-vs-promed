Confirmed outbreak of poisoning by clenbuterol
----------------------------------------------
The Jalisco Health Secretariat (SSJ) confirmed today [22 Jun 2010]
that 11 people at a party in the municipality of Arandas were victims
of poisoning by clenbuterol, bringing the total to 22 affected this
year [2010] by eating meat contaminated with the anti-catabolic agent.

The number of cases has exceeded last year's [2009] total of
clenbuterol poisoning cases, which was 17.

In a joint press conference, the delegation of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Livestock (SAGARPA), the SSJ, and the Regional
Livestock Union of Jalisco (URGJ), announced that they would intensify
actions to combat the illegal use of this substance and described the
agreements reached with the attorney General of the Republic (PGR) at
a meeting yesterday [21 Jun 2010]

Regarding the new cases, the public health director of SSJ, Jose Mario
Amezcua Marquez, said the 11 people were at a party in the community
of Santiago de Velazquez, Arandas, where they ate meat. All of them
had malaise and tachycardia, 9 of them had fine tremors, and half of
them suffered headaches and other symptoms. Most of the affected were
between 25 and 44 years old, although 1 was less than 24 years old. No
children less than 15 were affected. The affected were 7 women and 4
men who did not require hospitalization and are out of danger.

For his part, the Director of Health Regulation, Juan Carlos Olivares
Galvez, reported that 11 percent of meat samples tested this year
[2010] have tested positive for clenbuterol, which represents an
increase of 6 percent from last year's [2009] data.

[The delegate of SAGARPA, Juan Antonio Gonzalez and the URGJ
president, Andres Cano Ramos, had no knowledge of the latter
assertion, which only referred to the outbreak of poisoning in
Arandas, from what which said that (the poisoning) has not reached
2006 levels, when 262 cases were reported.

The Health Secretary Alfonso Petersen Farah, admitted there is a
higher percentage of positive samples in 2009, but said it analyzes
the most troubled areas and that the statistic is not representative
of the entire state (of Mexico).

Clenbuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic agonist drug with some anabolic
effects. It appears to redirect metabolism from fat to muscle. The
drug is approved for veterinary use as a bronchodilator in horses. In
humans, it is used as a weight loss drug. When the drug is used in
animals and humans ingest liver or muscle containing the drug, they
may experience an increase in heart rate, nervousness, headache,
muscular tremor, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills,
typically resolving within 2 to 6 days. As a result of such
consequences in humans, the United States and Europe actively monitor
urine and tissue samples from livestock for the presence of
clenbuterol. It is also being monitored in human athletes at
competitions and competitive games. - Mod.TG]
