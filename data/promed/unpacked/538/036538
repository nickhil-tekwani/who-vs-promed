More suspected EEE cases in Maine
---------------------------------
Maine's state veterinarian is describing an outbreak of eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) as "unprecedented." Don Hoenig confirmed Tuesday [8
Sep 2009] that 5 additional cases are suspected in Maine 4 in horses
and 1 in a llama. That's on top of 6 cases that were confirmed
previously.

The disease is spread through mosquitoes, and humans can get it from
mosquitoes as well. So far, no humans have been infected with the
potentially fatal brain infection in Maine, but health officials are
warning residents to be vigilant in avoiding mosquito bites.

Dr Dora Anne Mills tells the Bangor Daily News that the horse deaths
are "a strong red flag that the risk of EEE is much greater than we
thought."

Maine health chief issues warning
---------------------------------
With 9 confirmed cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) affecting
horses in Maine, the state health chief is warning Mainers to avoid
mosquito bites that could give them the disease.

In a briefing Thursday [10 Sep 2009], Dr Dora Anne Mills of Maine's
Center for Disease Control and Prevention said people who live near
bogs, swamps, and coastal marshes should be especially careful to
avoid bites by mosquitoes, which carry the disease. There are no
confirmed cases of humans being affected by the potentially fatal
disease this year [2009].

Mills said she's asked schools to reschedule sports events and
practices so they won't coincide with evening hours when mosquitoes
are out.

Mills says the state hasn't sprayed against mosquitoes carrying EEE
because the area where they live is so widespread.

EEE mainly affects horses, llamas, alpacas, and humans.

State vet calls local EEE case increase 'extraordinary'
-------------------------------------------------------
"It's extraordinary that we've had this many cases in Waldo County
with no previous history in Waldo County."

That was the comment Tuesday [8 Sep 2009] from Dr Don Hoenig, DVM,
state veterinarian with the Maine Department of Agriculture, regarding
the 3 confirmed cases of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) that have
been documented in Waldo County to date.

Statewide, there have been 6 horse deaths connected to EEE -- the
latest was a horse in Berwick that died of the disease last week [week
of 1 Sep 2009]. Test results on that horse came back positive for EEE
over Labor Day [7 Sep 2009] weekend.

The 3 EEE-related horse deaths in Waldo County were in Troy -- which
is where the 1st case was discovered in early August [2009] --followed
by 2 more equine deaths in Thorndike and Unity.

Hoenig said there are 5 more cases that are pending test results,
including 1 horse that died Saturday [5 Sep 2009] in Unity, where 2
horses had died in previous weeks. Of the 3 horse deaths in Unity,
Hoenig said 2 remain suspicious due to incomplete test results. Tests
are also being conducted on another horse that died in Jackson
Saturday [5 Sep 2009].

Two more horses -- one in Windsor and another in Newport -- are also
being tested for the virus, and Hoenig is also running tests on a
llama that died in the Ellsworth area [3 Sep 2009].

Hoenig said the swift spread of the virus there and around Maine is
cause for concern on many levels, particularly how it might affect
humans in the coming weeks. "This is a big concern to people in public
health as well as horse owners," he said. "We're all crossing our
fingers that we won't see any cases in people."

Hoenig said rising numbers of equine EEE cases can signify a warning
area, and may be followed by human cases a couple of weeks down the
road.

According to the Maine Centers for Disease Control, there is no
vaccine for humans, nor is there any specific treatment for the
disease. One third of the people who get the disease will die from it,
and about half of those with symptoms will suffer permanent
neurological damage.

With a few weeks of summer weather left, Hoenig said it might be too
early to hope for a frost. "That would really cut back on the number
of adult mosquitoes," he said. "Cold temperatures can cut down on
their activity, but it doesn't totally eliminate them." Hoenig said
mosquitoes don't usually stop flying until the mercury drops to 50 deg
F [10 deg C] or below.

In the meantime, Hoenig said, the state is conducting tests on the
mosquito populations in western Waldo County, where EEE appears to be
most prevalent. So far all of those results have come back negative,
but Hoenig said that effort is continuing this week. "If we had some
turn up positive, we'd have more of a target area to look at," he
said. Should mosquitoes in the test groups come up positive for EEE,
Hoenig said, the next step could be spraying the area of concern in
hopes of eradicating the infected insects.

Hoenig said that while it's a little late in the season to orchestrate
a low-cost regional vaccination clinic, he encouraged local horse
owners to get their animals vaccinated if they haven't already. Hoenig
added that the EEE vaccine is one that owners can also obtain over the
counter and administer themselves, though he advised owners to check
with their veterinarians first. "People should make sure it's
administered properly, and that they follow the directions on the
packaging, storing it at the proper temperature and administering a
booster when it's called for," he said.

Hoenig and local large animal vets are also doing their part to stay
informed about the spread of EEE, and are planning a meeting to that
end in Dover this weekend [12-13 Sep 2009].

State public health officials are also working to get the word out to
the public, both through communications with the press and through
public meetings about EEE.

Until the number of EEE cases drops off, though, Hoenig said all
anyone can do is hope for colder weather. "The weather is on our side,
but we still have a couple more weeks of summer-like temperatures," he
said. "We'll need to weather that situation, and hope for an early
frost."

[The state of Maine annually receives about 43 inches [1092 mm] of
rain on average. This year (2009), many places in Maine are receiving
about twice their annual rainfall. It has made it difficult to harvest
crops or enjoy the summer weather. It has also produced a bountiful
crop of mosquitoes and regrettably an apparently large number of
equine deaths due to eastern equine encephalitis.

Once an animal is vaccinated it takes 1-2 weeks for the animal to
develop protective measures within the body. If frost is several weeks
to a month off, it may be wise to vaccinate the horses. While frost
will help kill the mosquitoes, there are always those that seem to
hang around past the 1st hard frost.

Human beings cannot catch EEE from their horses. Horses, rather, are
the sentinel animals for this disease. Human beings can catch the
disease from mosquito bites. Use of repellants containing DEET, not
being out at dusk and early dawn, and wearing long sleeves will help
reduce a person's chance of acquiring the disease. - Mod.TG]
