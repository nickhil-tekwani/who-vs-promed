Suspected Acute Haemorrhagic Fever Syndrome in The Republic Of The Congo
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of The Republic of The Congo has reported 6
suspected cases including 5 deaths of acute haemorrhagic fever
syndrome in Mbomo district, Cuvette Ouest region. These suspected
cases have occurred in the same area as the previous reports of Ebola
haemorrhagic fever. A team from the Ministry of Health and WHO are on
site to investigate the suspected cases and collect samples. The
samples will be sent to the Centre International de Recherches
Medicales de Franceville (CIRMF) in Gabon for verification.
Ecosystemes Forestiers d'Afrique Centrale (ECOFAC) has sent a team to
investigate the deaths of wild animals in the affected area.

of the Republic of the Congo is in fact close to the locations in
Gabon and The Republic of The Congo where Ebola haemorrhagic fever
was reported in late 2001 and early 2002. - Mod.CP]

Additional Information from Field Workers in The Republic of The Congo
------------------------------------------------
Our field contacts in the area can fill in a bit of information
regarding the 11 Jun 2002 posting originating from the Associated
Press report [see: Ebola hemorrhagic fever - Congo Rep: suspected
20020611.4469].
We have no confirmation of the cause of morbidity or mortality on the
following cases but observers report that the clinical signs and
history are consistent with the previously seen Ebola hemorrhagic
fever cases this year in the same region:
2 human deaths on 5 Jun 2002 in the village of Mbomo (population
2500), which is approximately 50 km southeast of the border crossing
with Gabon Oloba village).
1 human death in Oloba, 2-3 days before.
1 human death in Ntolo, also 2-3 days before.
All 4 of these individuals came from the same group that had been
working in a gold mining camp in the forest south of Oloba towards
the village of Kelle. This is in the same general area as some
mortalities earlier this year. The individuals left the camp and
traveled along the 50-km stretch of dirt road that connects all of
the villages between Mbomo and the Gabon border at Oloba. The verbal
report (not possible to confirm due to the status of the victims)
suggests that "they" consumed a sick or dead chimpanzee.
As of 6 Jun 2002, 2 more individuals were ill with similar signs in
Mbomo. These individuals were held in quarantine but then released
due to strong social pressure in the village.
Humans and chimpanzees are not the only individuals at risk. This
area is also home to one of the world's largest remaining gorilla
populations. Field and lab work earlier this year in conjunction with
ECOFAC, CIRMF, MSF and the forest and wildlife authorities in Congo
and Gabon confirmed the first gorilla mortalities due to Ebola virus
along the same stretch of road.
