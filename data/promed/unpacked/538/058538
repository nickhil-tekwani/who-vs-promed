IMPORTED SEROPOSITIVE ANIMALS: ASSURANCE PROVIDED BY SEROLOGICAL TESTS
The Biosecurity Authority (previously the Regulatory Authority) of the New
Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) has completed an
analysis of the biosecurity risks posed by the importation of live cattle,
sheep, goats, horses and pigs, should any such animals be found
seropositive during post-arrival quarantine after having already tested
negative pre-export.
On a number of occasions in the past MAF has detected serologically
positive animals in quarantine. Each case has been dealt with on an ad hoc
basis and, at times, the decisions made have been criticised by interested
parties. This review aims to establish a basis for future incidents when
seropositive animals are detected.
Under the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS)
Measures, member countries of the World Trade Organisation are obliged to
ensure that their sanitary measures are based on a scientific assessment of
risk. MAF's policy on serological positive animals constitutes an SPS
measure, and as such it must be based on risk analysis.
The approach of this analysis is to consider in detail the epidemiology of
each of the diseases on lists A and B of the OIE, in order to reach a
decision for each disease as to whether a seropositive animal would
constitute a biosecurity threat to New Zealand. The major issue in reaching
such a decision is whether an animal which is serologically positive is
likely to be harbouring the particular disease agent. Other matters which
are also considered include whether the seropositive animal is likely to be
shedding the agent, and whether the introduction of the agent in an
imported animal can be expected to result in the establishment of the
disease here.
The analysis concludes that for many of the diseases considered of
importance for international animal trade there is an identifiable
biosecurity risk associated with seropositive animals.
However, for some diseases it is concluded that seropositive animals would
not be carrying the infectious agent, and therefore could be safely
released from post-arrival quarantine, albeit after a quarantine period of
several months in some cases.
For some insect-borne diseases it is concluded that although the agent is
likely to be carried by seropositive animals, the diseases would not be
capable of establishment as the necessary insect vectors do not exist in
New Zealand. However, with regard to insect-borne diseases on OIE lists A
and B, it remains the policy of MAF that animals which are viraemic or
parasitaemic will not be imported or released from post-arrival quarantine,
regardless of whether or not competent vectors exist here.
