Bovine tuberculosis: During a tuberculin test of the 20 goats kept in a school-farm in Kibbutz Kfar Ruppin, 2 animals were found positive [and slaughtered]; in one of the goats, pathological changes have been found. Samples have been submitted to the national laboratory, Ministry of Health, at Abu Kabir, for the isolation of the mycobacteria and their subsequent identification. The affected premises have been put under quarantine; extension of the quarantine will be considered when final lab results are obtained.

[Bovine tuberculosis, caused by _Mycobacterium bovis_, was eradicated decades back from Israel's cattle. In March 2019, after its absence on dairy farms for 28 years, bovine TB recurred in Israel. Two of the affected dairy herds had to be culled following unsuccessful attempts to clean them by the test-and-slaughter policy. There are currently additional infected dairy cattle farms under test-and-slaughter procedures.

In October 2020, an adult dairy cow from the dairy operation "Merom Hagilboah" in Meirav (map at https://tinyurl.com/4jxtuff7) presented with TB lesions when slaughtered in an abattoir; _M. bovis_ infection was lab confirmed. The said dairy operation is owned and managed together by 2 Kibbutz villages, Kfar Ruppin and Meirav, in north east Israel; the distance between them is 12 km [7.4 mi]. At that point in time, 635 milking cows were kept in Meirav and 480 female calves and heifers in Kfar Ruppin. The detection of bTB was followed by the application of test-and-slaughter policy in both facilities, which led, until April 2021, to the compulsory culling of more than 200 milking cows and 24 female calves. The sources of the said information are available (in Hebrew) at https://tinyurl.com/x9m3mk3k (click on the PDF) and https://en.calameo.com/read/0056379925e63f02b4c77.

The route of infection from the cattle shed to the small school zoo of Kfar Ruppin (20 goats) is yet to be established but is not surprising in view of being located in the same village. Although goats are strongly susceptible to experimental infection with mammalian and avian tubercle bacteria, "spontaneous" tuberculosis in this animal species is not very common. Several records are available that show, in mixed herds of cattle and goats, cross infection easily occurs. Most bovine-type infections in goats are airborne. In difference with cattle, death of infected goats is not rare. The veterinary literature includes descriptions of serious, strongly exudative processes with extensive cavity formation in the lungs and multiple ulcers in the intestines of tuberculous caprines. Human exposure to the infected or suspected animals should be strictly controlled.

Additional details on the recurrence of bovine tuberculosis to Israel is available in the commentary of ProMED archive no. 20210314.8246025. - Mod.AS
