OIE Press release: FAO and OIE send mission to North Korea
-----------------------------------------------
In response to a request from the government of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea, FAO and the World Organisation for Animal
Health (OIE) are sending a mission to investigate the 1st outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the country since 1960.
A team of 3 experts from the FAO/OIE Crisis Management Centre will
arrive in North Korea on 17 Mar 2007 for a one-week visit to assess
the situation, evaluate the need for assistance and provide
recommendations on the response to control the disease.
FMD was 1st diagnosed in January 2007 on a farm in Ryongkok, close to
the capital Pyongyang. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has
started with internationally accepted disease control measures. Cows
and pigs are being culled in the affected area, and movement controls
have been put in place throughout the country.
FMD is a highly contagious and sometimes fatal viral disease of cows,
sheep, goats and other cloven-hoofed animals, causing blisters on the
nose, mouth and hooves. The disease results in severe production
losses in livestock operations. The disease does not pose a threat to
human health.

S. Korea to help North curb cattle disease
-----------------------------------------------
South Korea has decided to provide quarantine equipment to North
Korea to help curb a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, Seoul officials
said Thursday [15 Mar 2007].
North Korea has reported an outbreak of the highly contagious animal
disease, saying it has culled thousands of pigs and cows.
"The North asked us to send quarantine equipment while informing us
of the current situation regarding the outbreak," Unification
Minister Lee Jae-joung told a news briefing.
Responding the request, the South will provide quarantine equipment
to the North, mostly materials for antibody induction, diagnosis kits
and pasteurizers, Lee said.
"We should stop the communicable disease from crossing the
inter-Korean border. Otherwise, it may spread to South Korean farms,"
he warned.
FMD is characterized by blisters in the mouth and on the feet of
hoofed animals such as cattle, sheep, goats and pigs. Although
harmless to humans, it can be fatal to animals [since it interferes
with walking and feeding. - Mod.JW].

[According to South Korea's notification to the OIE, the affected
population consisted of calves imported from Tieling city, Liaoning
province, People's Republic of China, some of which were showing
clinical signs after their introduction onto the (affected) farm. It
will be of importance to know whether those calves had been infected
on their farm of origin in Liaoning or rather after their arrival (in
January 2007?) at the farm in Ryongkok, near Pyongyang.
In February 2006, we posted a request for information on an alleged
outbreak of FMD, based upon published rumors from the village
Liangjia, Liaoning (see archive 20060207.0405). No response has been
received. We are grateful to Dan Silver for the following current
observation: "It may be of interest that Kangping County, where
Liangjia village is located, borders Tieling (specifically, Changtu
County of Tieling Municipality)."
South Korea suffered an outbreak of FMD (serotype O) during the 1st
semester of 2002. - Mod.AS]
