The polio virus has been found in sewerage samples taken from at least 10 different cities of the country [Pakistan] in different months of this year [2015], The Nation learnt on Wednesday [28 Oct 2015].

The samples were taken from Multan, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Jacobabad, Sukkur, Karachi, Quetta, Killa Abdullah and Dera Ismail Khan [DI Khan] under the environment surveillance programme of the Pakistan Polio Eradication Initiative, sources disclosed.

"Four areas are working as major reservoirs of polio virus and it moves to other areas of the country when people from these areas move to other parts of the country," sources confided to this scribe.

The areas include Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), the Quetta block (Killa Abdullah) in Balochistan, some parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the Gadap, Baldia and Gulshan-e-Iqbal areas of Karachi.

Sources disclosed that over 70 per cent of total polio cases reported from the country were reported from these reservoir areas while the majority of wild viruses reported from cases in other areas were also genetically linked to those of these reservoir areas. Polio experts believe that the harvesting season is the major time when the virus carriers take it to others areas as labourers and nomads move to different parts of the country during this time of the year to earn their living.

After 306 polio cases reported in 2014, the Polio Eradication Programme in Pakistan has made a major breakthrough as just 38 cases have so far been reported from across the country till filing of this report in 2015.

Sources claimed that a sudden surge in the number of cases in 2014 forced the country to revisit its polio eradication strategy. "The strategy was redesigned, micro planning was done and efforts were made to cover maximum population, especially nomads, to block the spread of polio. It delivered considerably," sources added.

Giving details of areas where virus was found in environmental samples, sources disclosed that it was traced in 4 samples in Multan [Punjab province] between January and October 2015. "We have 4 collection sites -- Ali Town, Head Naubahar, Sooraj Miani and Kotla Abdul Fatah in Multan. The virus was found in Sooraj Miani sample in April, Kotla July and Ali Town and Kotla August," sources further revealed. "This virus has a genetic link with that of Jacobabad [Sindh province] and Quetta [Balochistan province]," sources added.

There are 2 collection sites in Rawalpindi [Punjab province] and one in Islamabad [Islamabad Capital Territory], and occasionally virus is traced from the samples taken from Pir Wadahi site in Rawalpindi. In Lahore [Punjab province], the virus is found on Bund Road collection site, out of 3 sites as Pakhtun community is living in this area.

Similarly, there are 2 sample collection sites in Peshawar [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province] and virus is found at both sites continuously while the samples taken from DI Khan [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province] also contained virus, which had a genetic link with Killa Abdullah [Balochistan province] and Quetta.

Referring to Sindh, the sources disclosed that the virus was found from samples taken from Jacobabad/Sukkur and this virus had come from Karachi in 2014. Similarly, the samples taken from Hyderabad and Karachi also contained virus. In Balochistan, samples were taken from Quetta and Killa Abdullah which contained polio virus.

"Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan are polio free areas, while the samples taken from Faisalabad [Punjab province] have also turned out to be virus free," sources revealed.

[Pakistan had hoped to stop polio transmission by the end of 2014, but failed to do so. It has now established a new timeline for stopping polio by May 2016.

The report from the Polio Eradication Initiative, 28 Oct 2015, indicated 38 wild-type polio cases in Pakistan and zero circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus cases to 28 Oct 2015. It stated:

- No new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases were confirmed in the past week. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 16 Sep [2015] in Peshawar. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2015 remains 38, compared to 219 at this time last year [2014].
- No new type 2 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week, and no cases have been reported in 2015. The number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2014 remains 22. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on 13 Dec 2014.

The greatest number of cases are reported in Pakistan, followed by Afghanistan. It is imperative to eliminate polio from these last 2 endemic countries to protect all countries which remain vulnerable because of weak public health and immunization services and travel or trade links.
