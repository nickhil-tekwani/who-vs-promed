[Putting this official and the previous Ministry of Health report [19 Aug 2019, Anthrax - Kazakhstan (02): (AM) cattle, human 20190819.6629720] together, I suspect that the single affected cow was butchered on or about Thu 8 Aug 2019; the following Mon 12 Aug 2019, the sick butchering team was seen by the medics and diagnosed, and the provincial veterinarian informed; samples were taken from remaining parts of the carcass, possibly including bloody soil, sent for culturing, and then PCR-confirmed as _B. anthracis_. All of this takes time, so it was 4 days later, 16 Aug 2019, that bovine anthrax was confirmed. I wish we could all be as efficient as the veterinary diagnostic team in Astana. - Mod.MHJ
