Haitian health authorities will distribute pain medication to clinics around the country amid a surge in suspected cases of a mosquito-borne virus that is new to the region, a government official said Friday [23 May 2014].

More than 5500 suspected cases of the chikungunya virus have been reported in Haiti, up from 1500 cases a week earlier, Public Health Minister Florence Guillaume said.

The outbreak has been spreading around the Caribbean since the 1st known locally transmitted case was reported in French St Martin in December [2013]. There have been more than 55 000 suspected and confirmed cases in the region.

There is no vaccine for chikungunya and the primary treatment is pain medication for the high fever and arthritis-like ache in the joints that are symptoms of the illness.

Guillaume said in an interview on Radio Caribe that the government has 400 000 doses of acetaminophen to distribute and that any people who believe they have the virus can be treated at no cost. She urged anyone who has had a fever lasting more than 72 hours to seek medical attention.

The illness is rarely fatal though there have been deaths associated with chikungunya among people who are elderly or who have an underlying medical condition.

Illnesses caused by the chikungunya virus were first confirmed in the Dominican Republic [4 Apr 2014]. Numerous Spanish language media outlets, including HOY Digital, are quoting officials in the country's Ministry of Public Health as saying that there have been reported 32 519 suspected cases of the mosquito borne illness. This is a far larger number than the 8017 reported by both the Pan American Health Organization and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for the week ending [17 May 2014].

A lag in reporting data to public health authorities is not unusual, especially with countries that have limited resources. The latest numbers lend credence to media reports about crowded hospitals. The Ministry, late last week [week of 12 May 2014], did state that chikungunya was affecting 10 per cent of all Dominican households.

Other provinces affected having locally acquired cases include San Pedro de Macoris, Santo Domingo, Hato Mayor, Monte Plata, and Barahona.

The PAHO/WHO representative in Honduras, Ana Treasure, today [20 May 2014] said Honduras has no confirmed cases of chikungunya fever and there is no evidence of the presence of the disease, refuting versions issued by the Hospital Escuela that had mentioned 3 cases. Her statement came after the hospital authorities called a press conference in the evening to contradict the statements of some physicians.

On [Fri 16 May 2014], physicians from this medical center mentioned 3 cases of the disease caused by a virus transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, which was denied later by the hospital authorities.

The presence of this disease in Honduras has been officially discarded, and now there is work with the Secretariat of Health to train specialized personnel to detect this viral disease, Treasure said.

The symptoms of chikungunya [virus infection] can be confused with those of dengue fever: fever, joint and muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and skin rash, but in this [chikungunya] case, it is associated with inflammation of the joints (arthritis).

Most patients recuperate in a few days, but in some cases, joint pain can persist for months or even years. [The infection] can also generate eye, neurological, cardiac, and gastrointestinal problems, according to WHO.

[The initial report from the Hospital Escuela (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140519.2482881) did not provide convincing evidence that the 3 cases reported to be chikungunya virus infections were really that. Those reports are now refuted above.

There are now 20 confirmed cases of chikungunya disease in St Kitts, according to Acting Chief Environmental health Officer Alexander Riley. Mr Riley made this confirmation Tuesday [20 May 2014] during an edition of WINN FM's Talking Trash programme.

Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne disease that causes fever and joint pain in humans. Other symptoms of the disease include rash, muscle pain, and fatigue.

As the hurricane season approaches Mr Riley lists measures that the environmental health department will be taking to prevent the spread of chikungunya [virus] include fogging beginning this Wednesday [20 May 2014].

Meanwhile, Mr Riley sought to allay fears and concerns about the health and environmental health department risks of fogging, noting that the chemicals used are environmentally friendly.

[Fogging will provide only temporary vector mosquito control. Elimination or treatment of breeding sites is necessary for significant vector mosquito population reduction. This same report was also sent in by Roland Hubner.

[A report from the Ministry of Health (http://www.minsa.gob.pa/noticia/minsa-informa-de-dos-casos-importados-de-chikungunya) sent in by Roland Hubner stated that one of the suspected cases was a Brazilian citizen who had come from Haiti but was in Panama for only 24 hours. The 2nd case was a citizen of the Dominican Republic but resident of Panama, returned to Panama after a 19 day trip to the Dominican Republic. Panama has populations of _Aedes aegypti_ abundant enough to transmit dengue viruses that could permit ongoing transmission of chikungunya virus also.

"It's spread to 12 countries and will keep on spreading and undoubtedly cause millions of cases before it's all over. This is a huge threat to the tropical Americas, but also a threat to the contiguous states as well." This report was provided by Roland Hubner.
