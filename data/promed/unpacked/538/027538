First disease outbreaks reported
---------------------------------
The first outbreaks of communicable diseases were now being seen in areas hit
by last Sunday's (26 Dec 2004) killer waves in Asia, a senior WHO official
said today, 2 Jan 2005.
"There are increasing reports of diarrheal disease outbreaks coming from
displaced persons' settlements in Sri Lanka, in India," said David Nabarro,
the top official at the WHO dealing with humanitarian crises.
However he said the initial signs were not cause for alarm, although
preventive measures and treatments must continue. "They are not causing us
alarm because we expect this," he said.
"What we need to do is to make sure that we continue to distribute all
rehydration salts and treatment for diarrhea and we continue to do our work in
sanitation and water supplies."
The death toll from the catastrophe has now edged towards 126 000.

[This is likely the first of many reports regarding infectious
diseases emerging in the wake of the disastrous tsunamis. Although
much will be contaminated water-associated enteric disease including
cholera and typhoid, mosquito-transmitted diseases such as malaria,
and non-enteric water-linked diseases such as melioidosis and
leptospirosis will also occur. - Mod.LL]
