An outbreak of the highly infectious foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has killed more than 100 cows across Sabang area in West Bengal's West Midnapore district over the past 7 days, officials said on Friday [7 Sep 2018]. The outbreak has created panic among farmers, and the state animal resource development (ARD) department has sent teams across Sabang to tackle the situation.

District administration officials said they have been informed about deaths of more than 100 cows and calves in the last week. All the deaths have taken place in an area that is around 125 km [78 mi] to the west of Kolkata.

Trinamool [a political party in Bengal] Rajya Sabha [Council of States, the upper house of the Parliament of India] member Manas Bhunia [an Indian politician] has claimed that more than 350 cows have died in Bural, Bishnupur, Bhemua, and Mohar gram panchayat areas. On Friday [7 Sep 2018], a team of ARD department officials visited these areas.

"I have been informed by people in these gram panchayat areas that more than 350 cows have died, and more than 5700 cows have been affected. As soon as I got the information, I contacted district officials and requested them to take action," he said.

District officials said FMD primarily affects calves, and they are surprised to see so many fully grown cows dying. In the past, FMD has claimed livestock in Punjab, Haryana, and Tamil Nadu, but there has never been an outbreak of such a big scale in Bengal.

[As rightly argued by the district officials, fatal cases of FMD in adult cattle are not common. In most cases, the mortality in adult cattle is limited to 2-3 percent of the clinically affected animals. In neonatal and young animals, however, high mortality rates, sometimes exceeding 50 percent, may be observed. It is mainly caused by severe myocardial necrosis ("tiger heart").

The described event is in need of a thorough, lab-backed, veterinary investigation; for the time being, the diagnosis "FMD" remains pending. If FMD is confirmed, genotyping of the causative pathogen is warranted. The Indian subcontinent has been origin to several FMD serotype O strains that spread widely, including the ME-SA strain, which, starting its spread from India in 1990, eventually penetrated into the British Isles in 2001 after reaching as far south as South Africa and as far east as Japan.
