A coalminer diagnosed with the 1st case of "black lung" in Australia in more than 60 years worked in an underground mine for 6 years after early signs of the disease were missed in a medical examination.

The central Queensland man, 1 of 4 cases this year [2015] of pneumoconiosis, a disease previously thought to have been eradicated from the mining industry, still works in a coal-washing facility where he is exposed to dust, according to a union official.

The shock return of pneumoconiosis among workers in Queensland's underground coalmines, revealed in state parliament this week [week of 1 Dec 2015] by mining minister Anthony Lynham, has blindsided mining companies and prompted the government to threaten closures of mines breaching regulations on dust levels.

Lynham has commissioned an urgent review by Monash University experts of failures in the mining department's health monitoring system, which have left hundreds of thousands of miners' X-rays unchecked.

Professor Malcolm Sim, the head of Monash University's occupational and environmental health research division, told Guardian Australia he would travel to Queensland next [Wed 9 Dec 2015] to confirm terms with the government.

"We're keen to get that review under way as quickly as possible," he said.

The mining department has admitted to a national shortage of experts qualified to detect black lung in X-rays. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union (CFMEU) understands there have been no such experts in Queensland for at least 15 years, during which the state's coal industry boomed.

The re-emergence of black lung has been linked to exposure in underground mines, of which there were 13 operating in Queensland in 2013-14, according to the mining department.

Stephen Smyth, the Queensland president of the CFMEU, said the crucial 1st step was to determine how widespread the disease was. Of the 4 people diagnosed with black lung, 3 are believed to be still working in the industry and the other is a retired miner whose exposure to dust came some years ago in Ipswich [Queensland].

Smyth said the union first learned of the disease's re-emergence around May [2015], when the central Queensland miner was diagnosed.

In 2009, the man was given a clean bill of health after 3 medical assessments, including a chest X-ray. A US expert this year [2015] re-examined the 2009 X-ray.

"He picked up within 30 seconds that this [man] actually had the early onset of black lung in 2009, which was not picked up in Queensland," Smyth said.

Mining department documents show that in 1983, the former director of industrial medicine, Mannie Rathus, reviewed 7907 X-rays and of 499 "abnormal" scans, found 75 with signs of black lung, the ABC [Australian Broadcasting Corporation; see http://tinyurl.com/p74ojpt] reported. Rathus's report has never been made public.

Smyth said the union would "welcome any government action" on dust levels in underground mines, which he claimed were routinely in breach of the regulations.

[Coal worker's pneumoconiosis (also known as black lung because of the black dust of the coal) is a lung disease that results from breathing in dust from coal, graphite, or man-made carbon over a long period of time.

The risk of getting coal worker's pneumoconiosis depends on how long the workers have been around coal dust. Most people with this disease are older than 50. Smoking does not increase your risk of developing this disease, but it may have an additional harmful effect on the lungs.

Primary symptoms are shortness of breath and coughing.

There is no specific treatment for this disorder. Further exposure to the dust should be avoided. The outcome for the simple form is usually good. It rarely causes disability or death. The complicated form may cause shortness of breath that gets progressively worse.

Workers should wear a protective mask when working around coal, graphite, or man-made carbon. Companies should enforce the maximum permitted dust levels. All workers should avoid smoking.

There seems to be a communication breakdown somewhere. It is unclear if the lung radiographs of the workers were even checked. It does seem clear there is a complaint of not enough radiologists trained to read the radiographs. However, this is the age of telemedicine by the internet. There are radiologists all over the world that read radiographs on a variety of conditions. Electronic radiographs (x-rays) can be sent to any trained radiologist to read the films (no pictures, since they are digital), so a lack of trained radiologists may not be accurate, but it may take many contacts to find a radiologist capable of reading digital radiography regarding pneumoconiosis.

One also has to wonder what the exhaust fans in the mine are doing. Are they regulated? Are the workers wearing protective masks? Is their time in the mine limited? Why would they send a person who has been diagnosed with pneumoconiosis back into the mines? There are likely more questions than answers at the moment. However with 4 of these cases in recent years, it is surprising more aggressive measures are not in place to prevent this condition.
