A toddler and a policeman have become the latest victims of a
potentially deadly mosquito-borne disease in Western Australia. The
2-year-old child contracted Murray Valley encephalitis (MVE) in the
Kimberley and is now in Royal Darwin Hospital in a stable condition.

Constable Ryan Marron, 29, has come out of a coma in a Perth hospital
but is still unable to communicate. The policeman contracted the
disease during a 2-week relief stint at an Aboriginal community. It is
not known whether the pair will fully recover.

Last month [April 2011], a man who had been travelling in WA's
northwest became the 1st person in the state to die from the disease
in 3 years. A 19-year-old Canadian tourist also died after contracting
MVE while travelling through the Northern Territory earlier this month
[May 2011, see ProMED-mail archive no. 20110526.1610].

A Health Department spokeswoman said 9 West Australians had
contracted MVE this year [2011]. Several people remain very ill in
hospital, she said.

Medical entomologist Sue Harrington said initial symptoms of MVE
include fever, drowsiness, headache, a stiff neck, nausea and
dizziness. In severe cases, people could experience fits, lapse into a
coma and could be left with permanent brain damage or die, she said.
Ms Harrington said it was important for people to prevent mosquito
bites by avoiding outdoor exposure at night, securing insect screens
and wearing protective long-sleeve clothing outdoors.

[These 2 cases apparently are widely separated geographically in
Western Australia, with the Kimberly in the far northern part of the
state. Although not stated, the policeman presumably acquired his MVE
infection near Perth to the south. The unusually wet weather in much
of Australia this year (2011) has created extensive breeding sites for
vector mosquitoes. As Australian health authorities have predicted,
this has resulted in an increase in arthropod-borne virus infections,
including Murray Valley encephalitis, as noted above.
