[This outbreak appears to be in the pigeon population. Newcastle disease can occur in poultry but it is also often found in pigeons. Thus, the impact on trade should be nil as we would expect there would be no spillover into the poultry populations in Toscana. However, extra emphasis and vigilance of surveillance systems is warranted.
