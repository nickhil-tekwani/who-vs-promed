Today, Sunday, the Muthanna water directorate announced all those injured in the chlorine gas leakage accident at the central water station have left the hospital.

The director of Muthanna water, Muhammad Talib, said in a statement received (Basrawi News Encyclopedia) that "the station continues to serve after repairing the chlorine system, noting "the accident was due to human error away from any criminal suspicion."

He added, "The injured are employees of the station, and they are the ones who informed the civil defense detachments to deal with the accident."

[Chlorine gas is a respiratory irritant, but in high enough concentrations, pulmonary edema may develop. Chlorine gas may also cause headaches, nausea, and vomiting.

Exposure to low levels of chlorine gas for extended periods (chronic exposure) may produce pulmonary problems such as a chronic cough, phlegm production, wheezing, possibly asthma or asthma-like conditions, and eye irritation.

Humans can usually detect odor from chlorine gas at levels below 1 part per million (ppm). Mucous membrane irritation, which occurs at levels above 1 ppm, increases in intensity up to levels of about 15 ppm. Chest pain and shortness of breath usually occur at 30 ppm; pulmonary edema may develop at 40-60 ppm.

There is no specific treatment for those who are ill except to flush the eyes and maybe the nose, and to provide clean, fresh air. Treatment is symptomatic. Washing all affected areas of the body will help eliminate the chlorine on the skin and reduce the pain.

Chlorine gas in high levels is painful to the eyes and the respiratory system, and people exposed to very high levels can die.

Chlorine gas is usually yellow-greenish in color; it is heavier than air, so it remains near the ground.

Large amounts of chlorine in the water may produce chlorine salts and other chemicals when combined with substances in the water. - Mod.TG
