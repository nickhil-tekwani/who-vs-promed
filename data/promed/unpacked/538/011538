High false-negative rate limits value of rapid COVID tests for kids
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A meta-analysis published this week in the BMJ shows that COVID-19 rapid antigen tests for children don't meet minimum performance standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Already shown to be far less sensitive in adults than their manufacturers report, rapid antigen tests, also called lateral flow tests, are widely used in children to screen for COVID-19 in schools, homes, and healthcare settings. Amid scarcity of the over-the-counter tests, US households can now order 4 such tests from a US government website for free.

While experts say these nasal-swab tests -- sold under brand names such as BinaxNOW and BD Veritor -- have some value in disrupting virus transmission, it's important to understand their limitations -- especially amid the current surge of cases caused by the highly transmissible and evasive omicron (B.1.1.529) variant.

"I think an important point to remember is that with rapid antigen tests, positive results are generally meaningful, but negative results have to be taken with a grain of salt," Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told CIDRAP News.

Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) at the University of Minnesota, publisher of CIDRAP News, calls interpreting negative test results "a huge challenge". "The average consumer isn't going to know what this means. Many people will get a negative result and go to dinner with Grandma and Grandpa."

Poor sensitivity, acceptable specificity
----------------------------------------
In the 1st meta-analysis of its kind, a team led by University of Manchester researchers in the United Kingdom evaluated 17 studies involving 6355 children that compared rapid antigen test results with those from the gold-standard: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. The studies assessed 8 tests from 6 different brands.

Overall pooled diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the rapid tests were 64.2% and 99.1%, respectively. In children with symptoms, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 71.8% and 98.7%, respectively, and in those without symptoms, sensitivity and specificity were 56.2% and 98.6%, respectively. For reference, WHO and FDA performance standards for rapid antigen tests specify a minimum sensitivity of 80% and a minimum specificityâ€‰ of 97%.

Sensitivity is the probability that a test correctly identifies all positive cases; the higher the sensitivity, the lower the likelihood of false-negative results. Specificity, on the other hand, is the ability to identify those who don't have a condition; the higher the specificity, the lower the risk of false-positive results.

Of the 12 peer-reviewed studies in journals and 5 published on preprint servers, only 1 was at low risk of bias. The researchers concluded that the real-world performance of rapid antigen tests in children varied widely, only a few tests had relevant data, and the risk of bias was unclear due to poor reporting.

"Evidence gaps identified in this systematic review demonstrate current research needs to support evidence-based decision making," they wrote. "In particular, evidence is needed on the real-life performance of tests in schools (self-testing performed by children) and kindergarten (sample collection in toddlers by laypersons). ... Moreover, the implementation of routine audits of testing programmes may allow monitoring of test performance in practice outside of studies."

Many questions remain
---------------------
Rapid antigen tests for COVID-19 first became available in May 2020, when the FDA issued emergency use authorization for Quidel Corporation's Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIA. Since then, dozens of such tests have been marketed. They are convenient and can generate results in as little as 15 minutes. By comparison -- and depending on demand and availability -- several days may pass before more accurate PCR results are available.

On 28 Dec 2021, the FDA reported on its website that preliminary research on the performance of rapid antigen tests in patients infected with omicron suggests that "antigen tests do detect the omicron variant but may have reduced sensitivity", referring to the potential for false-negative results.

The FDA should have released clearer information sooner, Osterholm said, citing cases whereby "an individual is negative for multiple days in a lateral flow test, including on the day a PCR test shows that they are, in fact, positive. We're still trying to clarify what the results tells us about one's infection status and whether it tells us anything about how infectious you are and able to transmit the virus."

Tests don't eliminate risks
---------------------------
The uncertainty about whether negative rapid antigen tests can be trusted -- as well as the similarity of COVID-19 symptoms and those caused by allergies or other common infectious diseases -- has caused confusion for parents trying to make decisions about school and other activities.

Wroblewski recommends that parents of symptomatic children who receive a negative result from a rapid antigen test seek a PCR test for confirmation. If a child tests negative on a rapid test and has no symptoms but was exposed to COVID-19 at school or elsewhere, following up with another rapid test a day or 2 later could be prudent, she said. "I think parents can, to a certain extent, use their judgment," with negative test results, Wroblewski said. "If your kid has the sniffles but no severe symptoms, no fever, you can probably send them to school with a mask. But if they've had an exposure and have a sniffle, maybe just keep them home. Even if it's not COVID, they could have something else that's infectious."

However, if children test positive and have symptoms, they should be considered infected and kept home from school and other activities, Osterholm said. The important thing to understand is that rapid tests are not perfect, Wroblewski said. "If your child is asymptomatic and you're using rapid antigen tests to identify those asymptomatic infections before they go to school, see grandparents, or get on a plane, you're not going to eliminate the risk that someone is actually infected and might move to positive in the next 24 hours," she said. "You're mitigating the risk."

No reduced fertility with COVID vaccines, but infection ups risk in men
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
A cohort study of more than 2000 US and Canadian women indicates that COVID-19 vaccination does not impair fertility, but men who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 may experience short-term reduced fertility, according to surveys of the women's partners.

In the study, published yesterday in the American Journal of Epidemiology, Boston University (BU) researchers analyzed survey data on COVID-19 vaccination and infection, and fertility, among female and male participants in the Pregnancy Study Online (PRESTO), an ongoing study funded by the National Institutes of Health that enrols women trying to conceive and follows them from before conception through 6 months after delivery. Participants included 2126 women in the United States and Canada who provided information on themselves and their male partners from December 2020 to September 2021. The investigators conducted follow-up through November 2021.

The researchers calculated the per-menstrual cycle probability of conception using self-reported dates of participants' last period, typical menstrual cycle length, and pregnancy status. They found that the fertility rates among female participants who received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine were nearly identical to unvaccinated female participants. Fertility was likewise similar for male partners who had received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine compared with unvaccinated peers.

In contrast, men who tested positive for COVID-19 within 60 days of a given cycle had lower fertility than men who never tested positive or with men who tested positive at least 60 days before. This finding did not hold true for the women and supports previous research that has linked COVID-19 infection in men with poor sperm quality and other reproductive dysfunction, according to a BU School of Medicine news release.

First author Amelia Wesselink said in the release, "Our study shows for the first time that COVID-19 vaccination in either partner is unrelated to fertility among couples trying to conceive through intercourse. Time-to-pregnancy was very similar regardless of vaccination status." Senior author Lauren Wise said, "The prospective study design, large sample size, and geographically heterogeneous study population are study strengths, as was our control for many variables such as age, socioeconomic status, preexisting health conditions, occupation, and stress levels."

Moderna vaccine outperforms Pfizer's against delta breakthrough cases
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A study yesterday [20 Jan 2022] in JAMA shows the Moderna mRNA vaccine was more protective than the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine at preventing breakthrough COVID-19 cases during the US delta surge.

The study was based on electronic health records from 637 000 fully vaccinated patients from 63 healthcare organizations across the United States, dated from Jul-Nov 2021. Full vaccination was considered to be 2 or more weeks since a 2nd dose of mRNA vaccine. Patients who were boosted (given a 3rd dose) or who had prior COVID-19 infections were excluded from the study.

Moderna recipients were less likely to be infected with breakthrough cases and less likely to be hospitalized. There were 2.8 breakthrough cases per 1000 people in those vaccinated with Pfizer and 1.6 cases per 1000 with Moderna in November 2021, and the 60-day hospitalization rate was 13.3% for Pfizer recipients and 12.7% for Moderna.

Neither group had high mortality rates: The 60-day mortality was 1.14% (35/3078) and 1.10% (207/18 737) for Moderna and Pfizer recipients, respectively. "Although there is a difference in breakthrough infections, both vaccines are highly protective against SARS-COV2 infection and especially against the most severe consequences of infection," said study co-author Pamela B Davis, in a Case Western University press release.

[3] What happens next
Date: Wed 19 Jan 2022

https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/danvergano/omicron-future-variants


Omicron changed the pandemic. What happens next?
------------------------------------------------
The omicron variant's worldwide surge has upended early hopes for a return to normality and points to a more uncertain future for the pandemic, some experts say. The advent of the variant has shaken many scientists who were once confident that they had a handle on SARS-CoV-2. First identified in November [2021], just 2 months ago, omicron has led to global case reports of around 3 million new cases a day worldwide, nearly a 5th of them in the US. In the last week, cities such as New York, Boston, and Washington, DC have reported signs that COVID cases have started to decline, echoing earlier drops seen overseas in the United Kingdom and in South Africa.

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's forecasts for COVID cases project the US peak coming nationwide in the next 2 weeks, heading up to 800 000 new cases a day before a sharp decline. Those same forecasts predict COVID-19 deaths approaching 3000 a day in the US in February [2022] -- nearly doubling the current, already awful rates -- as the variant cuts its deadly swath through the country. [https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/ #forecasting_ weeklycases]

"We are going to have a tremendous number of deaths among the unvaccinated," said immunologist John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. "And we're going to have -- even if we manage to eke our way through this -- the scar tissue in the health system, which is going to last for a long time and is not going to be something that recovers when infection rates go down."

Shaken scientists, meanwhile, are reassessing their understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the aftermath. In 3 months, the omicron variant has dramatically redefined how bad a COVID surge can be, even when vaccines are readily available. The new reality raises hard questions about what will happen after omicron recedes.

Will there be a lull?
---------------------
In South Africa and the UK, a steep decline in omicron cases has raised hopes that the winter surge will be followed by a spring lull. With increased population immunity from vaccination and the tornado of infections that has swept the US, as well as the rollout of hundreds of millions of antiviral pills promised by the Biden administration for this year [2022], it's possible the next chapter of the pandemic will be that of a virus in retreat, one defanged but not defeated.

Twitter: @PeterHotez [Professor Peter Hotex MD PhD]: "Our post omicron world: omicron goes down; it fails to produce herd immunity, durable protection; we'll have 6 months to vaccinate the world, prevent a new variant from emerging this summer; [the new variant] may not resemble omicron; vaccinating world in next 6 months = our best path"

Scott Hensley, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania, told Stat that he expects those factors will make omicron the last wave of the pandemic. Coronavirus infections would continue, but rarely lead to deaths or hospitalization. We [would] return to a world without masks, shuttered offices, or canceled public events.

Many other scientists argue that there are no guarantees that US case numbers will fall to where they were before the omicron surge began, for example.

Twitter: @DocJeffD [Jeffrey Duchin, MD]: "Lots of soothsayers predicting omicron peaking soon in the US. That would be most welcome, yet begs the question, what comes next? Shangri-La? S. Africa took a month to peak & now, 3 weeks post peak, incidence is still is 25X above the pre-omicron baseline. ..."

The aftermath of omicron may be a patchwork of different experiences, both around the globe and across the country. "We're starting to get a sense of what happens now after omicron," Lemieux of Massachusetts General Hospital said, speaking Tuesday [18 Jan 2022] at a briefing for reporters. "And we're seeing not a single consistent behavior."

In some places after an omicron surge, there is a resurgence of the delta variant. In others, omicron has been replaced by a sister "stealth" lineage of the omicron variant called "B.A.2", seen rising in Denmark and India. That means the post-omicron pandemic may look different everywhere.

["Efforts to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from a new analytical tool developed by a team led by biologists at Boston College, who report their computer simulation of molecular interactions can predict mutations of the virus and help develop insights into future variants of concern before they emerge.

"'We computationally predict what mutations allow better binding to host receptors and better evasion of antibodies,' said Boston College assistant professor of biology, Babak Momeni, a lead researcher on the project. 'Such mutations can potentially lead to a future variant of concern. Having this knowledge from our model would help with readiness for detecting and preventing, as well as treating, emerging and future variants.'

"'We find that omicron has not reached its full potential to bind human host cells,' Momeni said. 'We identify mutations that can strengthen the virus affinity for the human cell, which could increase infectivity and evasion of antibodies.' He cautioned that increased infectivity is only one important aspect in variants of concern; it is also important to monitor the severity of symptoms and the ability of the variant to evade antibodies and vaccines.

"While the study found that omicron's spike proteins bind better than the delta variant to the human ACE2 receptor, not all mutations in the spike protein's targeting system -- known as a receptor binding domain -- are beneficial for binding, which suggests factors other than binding may also be involved in determining how the variant evolves.

"Momeni said the team was surprised to see a range of mutations -- some beneficial, some neutral, and some detrimental -- to hACE2 binding. He said the team's next steps are to experimentally validate the predictions of the model. ..."

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20JAN21_1642947468.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative totals reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20JAN21WORLD7_1642947513.pdf. It is from this table that numbers in the following commentary are derived.

In the past 24 hours, 41 countries -- USA (849 717), France (400 851), India (340 099), Brazil (168 820), Italy (189 174), Spain (141 095), Germany (138 634), Belgium(121 926), Argentina (118 171), Peru (116 353), the UK (95 776), Sweden (97 248), Turkey (72 555), Australia (58 216), Israel (64 071), Portugal (58 530), Mexico (49 906), Sweden (42 295), Japan (94 169), Netherlands (57 471), Denmark (43 671), Kazakhstan (31 453), Switzerland (37 897), Russia (49 513), Poland (36 664), Ecuador (35 157), Czech Republic (26 987), Columbia (31 039), Canada (20 632), Philippines (32 605), Bolivia (19 583), Serbia (16 403), Norway (24 958), Hungary (15 957), Vietnam (15 935), Ukraine (20 156), Pakistan (14 218), Uruguay (12 874), Panama (11 933), Bangladesh (11 434), and Croatia (11 114) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 10 437 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 19 Jan 2022 to late 20 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate an increasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 88 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 44 of the 88 countries are from the European region, 16 are from the Americas region, 10 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 from the South East Asia region, and 7 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 12.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 11.6%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 7.6% decrease in daily reported cases and a 10.3% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Worldwide over 4.01 million newly confirmed infections were reported in the past 24 hours with over 347.06 million cumulative reported cases and more than 5.60 million reported deaths. Transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
