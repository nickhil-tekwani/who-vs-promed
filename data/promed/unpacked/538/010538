ITAR-TASS has reported an outbreak of a very severe dysentery involving 494
persons, 236 of them children, as counted on December 28, 1997. The agency
said 354 people had been hospitalized in the towns of Kola, Murmansk and
Severomorsk. [Disease] symptoms include sudden fever, intense headaches,
pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, loss of appetite, vomiting,
diarrhoea, skin rash, a metallic taste in the mouth and bleeding from the
orifices, leading to potentially fatal internal bleeding.
The outbreak started a few days earlier in the nearby town of Kola and the
source was traced to a dairy supplying the two towns. [The dairy] was
closed and all its produce removed from the shops. "Local health
authorities have sufficient medicines to threat those affected," a
spokesman told the agency.
By midday on December 29, 1997, the number of suspected cases had risen to
534, ITAR-TASS news agency said. Doctors believed people were now catching
the disease from one another.
Regional emergencies officials said that a team of experts from Moscow had
arrived on December 28th to help local medical staff tackle the outbreak
and the Regional administration had contributed additional funding.

[This sounds like a serious outbreak, and it is odd that nothing has been
reported concerning specific etiology or numbers of fatalities, especially
in light of the comments about adequacy of medical supplies and the
potential for fatal internal bleeding. Shigellosis and EHEC come to mind
as possible etiologies. We would appreciate updates and additional
information to clarify this situation. - Mod.ES]
