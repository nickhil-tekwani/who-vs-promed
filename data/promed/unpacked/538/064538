The deaths of 16 spotted deer [chital] at the Delhi Zoo over the past 3 months have flummoxed authorities, prompting calls from activists for a sweeping review of animal care procedures.

Officials suspect the chital died of rabies triggered by mongoose bites, but have found little evidence so far.

According to sources, the spate of deaths began in February [2016] but administrators swung into action only after the Central Zoo Authority (CZA), a regulatory body for zoos under the government of India, asked for a report.

The CZA called the deaths an "epidemic", but zoo representatives say the situation is under control and preventive measures have been taken.

"We have been monitoring the situation as there has been some mortality. Rabies has been detected as the cause of death," the zoo's director, Amitabh Agnihotri, told Mail Today [9 May 2016].

"We are vaccinating the animals and all preventive actions have been taken. Death due to rabies is common phenomena among mammals."

The incidents have prompted concerns that something is wrong at the showcase zoo, which houses over a thousand animals, reptiles, and birds. It was previously in the news 2 years ago when a young man was mauled to death by a white tiger after he jumped into the big cat's enclosure.

"As per law, it is the zoo's responsibility to protect animals, but it has failed to do so. The loss of 16 deer is irreparable," said animal rights activist Naresh Kadyan.

The zoo has around 120 spotted deer. Following the deaths, 20 have been vaccinated and separated from the herd.

Officials say the outbreak surfaced on [14 Feb 2016] after drain water swamped the deer enclosure. When 2 of the animals died, officials assumed they drank contaminated water. But soon other deer started falling ill, with at least one of them frothing at the mouth.

"Samples were sent to the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) in Izatnagar, Bareilly," said a zoo official. Dr AK Sharma, principal scientist at the IVRI, confirmed to Mail that 13 of the 16 specimens tested positive for rabies. "Even sambar deer were earlier detected with the virus," he said. Zoo authorities have started vaccinating other animals, though the CZA alleges that they failed to act promptly.

"No official communication was sent to the CZA as zoo officials tried to hush up the matter. But as the situation was alarming, the CZA instructed the Delhi zoo to take immediate action and submit a report. Loss of 16 deer in such a short span of time indicates negligence in handling epidemic," said a senior official associated with the matter.

The zoo is part of conservation breeding programmes of the Central Zoo Authority for the Royal Bengal tiger, Indian rhinoceros, swamp deer, Asiatic lion, brow-antlered deer, and red jungle fowl.

According to a senior official, mongoose bites could be the reason behind the deaths. "We have found some outlets and holes from where they could have entered the spotted deer enclosure. We have filled those gaps to check the entry of mongoose and a team has been formed to capture them," said the official, adding that no traces of any dogs were found inside the park.

However, authorities are unsure why only the spotted deer were infected as their enclosure is very close to those of other deer. "We are ensuring no more casualties take place and animals are being vaccinated and kept in separate areas so that the complete herd is treated. So far, close to 20 deer have been vaccinated and the entire process will take a few months," said a member of the zoo's veterinary department.

Along with animals, zookeepers are also being vaccinated. "Although the disease is non communicable, there is a chance of an infected animal's saliva coming into contact with human blood," said an official, adding that all workers are wearing gloves and boots before entering the enclosure.

[Mongooses are indigenous to Africa and Asia and have been introduced in many parts of the world (for a picture see http://bit.ly/1T8IIis). In Cuba, Puerto Rico, Grenada, and South Africa they are the major reservoir of rabies. It is uncertain why mongooses are suspects in this rabies outbreak. In Delhi, mongoose rabies accounts for only 0.4 percent of the human cases of rabies, while dogs are responsible of 96.7 percent of them (Ind J Pediat 2004, 71: 217-20).
