Giardiasis and Cryptosporiasis (Cymru/Wales)
-----------------------------------------------
I would like to comment on the suggestion by the moderator (EP) that
the outbreaks of _Cryptosporidium_ and _Giardia_ in North and Mid
Wales are linked. As an academic microbiologist specializing in
soil-borne pathogens, I am not involved in either investigation, but
I can bring some local knowledge to the table.
I am not aware of such a suggestion of linkage being made by the
investigation teams. Furthermore the statement that the source
reservoir in the _Cryptosporidium_ outbreak and the primary school
implicated in the _Giardia_ outbreak are within 30 km is incorrect;
as the crow flies, the distance is about 100 km. And in Wales, the
distance on the ground is much greater than as the crow flies.
Multiple watersheds lie between both sites, and my understanding is
that the Cwellyn reservoir in North Wales serves North Wales and that
Aberystwyth is served by reservoirs immediately to its east. To my
knowledge, no cases of _Cryptosporidium_ have been observed in
Aberystwyth, and vice versa in North Wales, as would probably be the
case in a linked outbreak caused by common fecal contamination.
The 2 outbreaks are thus geographically unlinked. Wales has seen
several apparently independent outbreaks of gastrointestinal
infection (_E. coli_ H7:O157 in North Wales and a larger outbreak in
South East Wales as well as the above) within the last few months,
and in each set of outbreaks, an assumption of direct linkage has
been made and refuted.
The investigation is being reported on the basis that the primary
cases have been associated with travel to an undisclosed foreign
location, and the linked secondary cases are linked to a learning
disability support unit in a primary school. I would find the
hypothesis of lapses in hygiene resulting in dissemination within the
learning disability support unit far more plausible than one of
common fecal contamination of water supplies across most of Mid and
North Wales.

[ProMED thanks Arwyn Edwards for his valuable comments. The key
information is that the 2 areas are served by different water
reservoirs. Therefore, the 2 outbreaks cannot be linked, and it is a
mere coincidence that they occurred within a few days of each other. - Mod.EP]
