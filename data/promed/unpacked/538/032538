The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services reported a case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a horse in Leon County in the panhandle. This is the 4th confirmed EEE case for Florida in 2021.

EEE is spread to horses and humans by infected mosquitoes, including several _Culex_ species and _Culiseta melanura_.

In horses, the virus causes inflammation or swelling of the brain and spinal cord. General signs include central nervous system signs such as: head pressing, convulsions, lack of response to facial stimulation, fever above 103 F [39 C], ataxia, paralysis, anorexia, depression and stupor. Other signs may include irregular gait, teeth grinding, in-coordination, circling, and staggering. All signs may not be exhibited by an infected horse.

The mortality rate in horses from EEE is almost 90%.

In humans, symptoms of EEE disease often appear 4 to 10 days after someone is bitten by an infected mosquito.

EEE is a more serious disease than West Nile virus (WNV) and carries a high mortality rate for those who contract the serious encephalitis form of the illness. Symptoms may include high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, and sore throat. There is no specific treatment for the disease, which can lead to seizures and coma.

On 17 Jun 2021, the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA) was notified of a confirmed case of eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) in a 26-year-old horse located in the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas, and Glengarry.

Veterinarians in Ontario should consider EEE as a differential diagnosis in horses exhibiting neurological signs and can identify positive cases through appropriate testing. IgM antibodies to the EEE virus (EEEv) can be detected in serum from horses with neurological signs. Clinical signs of EEE including circling, head-pressing, ataxia, and depression, can mimic a variety of encephalitides, including rabies, West Nile virus (WNV), botulism, hepatic encephalopathy, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis, and equine herpes myeloencephalopathy. Most equine cases of EEE in Ontario occur between August and October and end with the onset of frost.

Effective equine vaccines for EEE are available, and veterinarians should encourage clients to keep their horses' vaccinations current. Once clinical infection develops, treatment options are limited to supportive care. The mortality rate in unvaccinated horses is high.

EEEv affects mainly equine species in eastern North America, but can occasionally cause severe disease in humans, including permanent brain damage or death. EEEv has also caused fatal infections in pheasants, quail, captive whooping cranes, emus, and dogs.

EEEv has been present in the Ontario horse population since 1938.

[The 1st case of eastern equine encephalitis in 2021 was in January 2021 in Florida. This is exceptionally early. This was followed by EEE reported in sentinel chickens, and now there is another equine case.

EEE is transmitted by mosquitoes. There is a vaccine for it. The immunity wanes fairly quickly, and in areas such as Florida or other areas where the disease is circulating, vaccination is recommended every 3-4 months. Vaccine is cheap compared to losing your equine friend.

EEE vaccine is usually combined with western equine encephalitis (WEE), West Nile virus (WNV) and tetanus vaccines. This vaccine offers a lot of protection from several mosquito transmitted diseases and includes tetanus. This vaccine will need to be repeated in about 3-4 weeks if your horse has never been vaccinated against these diseases. Then, it may be advantageous to revaccinate the EEE portion approximately every 3-4 months.

Control mosquitoes by using sprays approved for horses to repel flies and mosquitoes. Remove any standing water around your house and/or barn. Places that accumulate water where mosquitoes can breed include things such as catch trays of potted plants, old tires, and stagnant puddles where water may stand; even rainwater barrels left unprotected from mosquitoes can serve as breeding places for mosquitoes. These areas of standing water should be cleared out. - Mod.TG
