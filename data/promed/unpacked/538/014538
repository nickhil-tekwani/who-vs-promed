Anthrax claims one, affects 20 in Koraput village
- -----------------------------------------------
One person died of anthrax and 20 others were affected in Jadidhara village of Chipakur gram panchayat under Boipariguda block in Koraput district during the last 3 days.

According to reports, villagers were taken ill after consuming half-boiled meat of an anthrax affected buffalo a few days back. Due to lack of medical facilities, they were treated by quacks. However, after he died and 20 others were affected, the local panchayat [district] officials reported the matter to Boipariguda Primary Health Centre (PHC). On Thursday [18 Apr 2013], some of the affected villagers were admitted to the PHC.

Jeypore SDMO [Senior District Medical Officer] Dadhibaban Tripathy, who visited the village on Sunday [21 Apr 2013], confirmed that Dhanu had died of anthrax. He said the [samples from the dead] animal will be sent to Cuttack for tests. [Cuttack is the administrative headquarters of Orissa. - MHJ] The doctor added that a special medical team from the district headquarters hospital with sufficient medicines is camping in the affected village and treating the patients. All precautionary measures are being taken, he added.

Orissa is a constant in the Indian anthrax statistics with human cases in 2001, 2003 through 2008, and 2011; the data for 2012 has yet to be released. There have been significant numbers of bovine outbreaks & cases on an essentially annual basis. The disease is enzootic in some 18 of the 30 districts in the state. Reading between the lines of this local news report one can readily see why.-Mod MHJ]
