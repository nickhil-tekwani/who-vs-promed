[In August 2017, an FMD outbreak in cattle was reported in the Chikwawa region. According to information sent to the OIE, that event is still continuing, and the serotype is pending. The affected herd was in a communal grazing system in close proximity to buffalos that were in Lengwe National Park. Buffalos occasionally stray out of the park and graze with cattle. The population was within the locality that was strategically vaccinated against FMD using a trivalent FMD vaccine containing SAT1, SAT2 and SAT3.
