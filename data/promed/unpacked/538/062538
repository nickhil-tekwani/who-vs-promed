In the span of a few weeks, a patient has been transformed from a
vibrant 23-year-old woman who loved nature to a person battling for
her life.

In early January [2011], the Fredericton woman contracted a
potentially fatal condition called cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal
disease carried in the feces of pigeons. The debilitating illness
attacks the spine and brain, causing severe swelling. It left her
confined to a hospital bed in a state of delirium for weeks. But the
most devastating side effect is that the patient is now blind.

"Be aware of this disease. It could kill a child in a heartbeat," the
patient said in an interview from her hospital bed. "It could kill a
senior in a heartbeat without you even having to worry about the
symptoms. It comes on that fast. If you don't realize the symptoms, it
could kill you, too."

Her emotional warning comes on the heels of city council's approval
earlier this month [April 2011] of a recommendation that it toughen
its animal control bylaw to allow for fines for feeding pigeons. Once
the amendment is drafted and declared law, it will give the city's
bylaw enforcement officers the power to ticket and fine offenders.

The patient said she decided to go public about her illness after
learning about a recent newspaper story about a problem with pigeon
poop in the city. "Please don't feed the pigeons," she said. "Try to
shoo them away if you see them. ... It (the disease) is horrible. The
pain that you get from this disease is crippling. The after-effects
are with you for life and you just can't stop thinking about it. I
just want other people to know and try to stay away from pigeons."

Oddly enough, the patient said she has no recollection of ever being
anywhere near pigeons. "I am still wondering to this day where I got
it," she said. "I could have stepped in it and brought it into the
home. I just don't know."

The patient said the symptoms started with a migraine headache that
wouldn't go away. She was admitted to hospital on [10 Feb 2011] after
many days of intense head pain. Shortly after, she went into a
coma-like state. "When I woke up I thought I had a mask over my eyes,
but I was wrong. I was blind. I was recently told that I will be blind
for the rest of my life. This is a tough thing for a 23-year-old to go
through. ... My world crumbled around me." The patient said the odds
of surviving the disease are 50-50. "However, I managed to make it
through," she said, battling tears. "I don't know how but I am still
here, and I am glad because I get to warn everyone else of this."

Cristin Muecke, the Health Department's regional medical officer,
confirmed the disease is often associated with pigeon droppings. She
said the illness can't be spread person to person and is more common
with someone who has immune problems.

The patient, however, said she has never had a problem with her
immune system and that's what's so puzzling about contracting the
affliction. "I do not want anyone else to suffer this agonizing
disease and I ask anyone who is feeding pigeons to stop," she said.
"It's not just a matter of keeping your neighbourhood clean ... it's a
matter of keeping people healthy."

[Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by the encapsulated yeast
_Cryptococcus neoformans_ or _Cryptococcus gattii_. These 2 species
have 5 serotypes based on antigenic specificity of the capsular
polysaccharide; these include serotypes A, D, and AD (_C. neoformans_)
and serotypes B and C (_C. gattii_). The ecologic niches for _C.
neoformans_ and _C. gattii_ appear to be distinct. _C. gattii_ lives
in the soil and areas on or around trees, such as the eucalyptus. _C
gattii_ is not associated with birds, whereas _C. neoformans_ is found
in the accumulated droppings around roosting and nesting sites of
birds, especially pigeons. Pigeons are not known to acquire
symptomatic disease but can carry cryptococci on feathers, skin, in
the crop and cloaca [common cavity into which the intestinal, genital,
and urinary tracts open].

Cryptococci can become aerosolized when dried bird droppings or
contaminated soil are stirred up. People can become infected when they
inhale aerosolized cryptococci, which primarily infect the lung, but
may subsequently spread systemically via the bloodstream, especially
to the central nervous system where the organisms cause a basilar
meningoencephalitis.

_C. gattii_ has caused a large-scale outbreak in British Columbia and
the Pacific Northwestern US since 1999 that involves terrestrial and
marine mammals and several hundred humans. The route by which _C.
gattii_ was introduced into North America has not been established.
Importation of contaminated eucalyptus trees or seeds, or wooden
pallets or crates made from eucalyptus (that are not routinely
inspected for microbial contamination upon entry into Canada or the
US) have been suspected as a source. Subsequent spread has been
thought to be possibly due to human and other animal activity (Kidd
SE, Bach PJ, Hingston AO, et al: _Cryptococcus gattii_ dispersal
mechanisms, British Columbia, Canada. Emerg Infect Dis. 2007 Jan
13(1): 51-7; available from
http://www.cdc.gov./ncidod/eid/13/1/51.htm).

_C. neoformans_ infects mostly immunodeficient individuals (such as
patients with AIDS/HIV or organ transplant recipients). It does not
usually affect healthy people. In contrast, 70-80 percent of
cryptococcal infections among immunocompetent hosts are caused by _C.
gattii_; _C. gattii_ infections are mainly pulmonary (75 percent),
although neurologic (8 percent) and combined (9 percent) infections
are seen. The outbreak strains in the Pacific Northwest are
particularly virulent and associated with high mortality. [New
Brunswick, however, is in the Atlantic Northeast. - Mod.JW]

Blindness in cryptococcal meningitis, which can be due to high
cerebrospinal fluid pressure, optic neuropathy, or endophthalmitis,
has been noted to be a relatively common occurrence in immunocompetent
individuals infected with _C. gattii_ (Seaton RA, Verma N, Haraqi S,
et al: Visual loss in immunocompetent patients with _Cryptococcus
neoformans_ var _gattii_ meningitis. Trans R Soc Trop Med Hyg. 1997;
91(1): 44-9; abstract available from
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9093627). However, neither the
species of cryptococcus causing meningitis, nor a history of travel to
the Pacific Northwest, are given for the immunocompetent patient
presented in the news release above.

Fredericton, with a population of about 50 500 in 2006, is the
capital of the Canadian province of New Brunswick
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredericton#Geography_and_climate).
The city, without rail service, is located inland on the Saint John
River, about 70 miles (112 km) east of the US-Canada border and 70
miles (112 km) north of the city of Saint John on the coast
(http://books.google.com/books?id=a-IdqKGQJpIC&pg=PA192&lpg=PA192&dq=fredericton+canada+distance+from+US+border).
