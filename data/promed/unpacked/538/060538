[It has now been 26 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan, 12 days more than one incubation period (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). It has now been 36 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though low level local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 22 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from both Guangdong and Heilongjiang are decreasing.

According to the report above, a total of 82 862 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4633 deaths, representing an increase of 4 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (28 Apr 2020) report. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 72 hours. And Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases.

As best as I can decipher from the machine-translated report above, there were 33 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, 2 were in imported cases. There was no case of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 998, and 127 of these are importations from abroad. It would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As reported on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong (perhaps approaching interruption) and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are experiencing a decline. Cases continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 76.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 41.6% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. In addition to Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont, 1 other province (Liguria) has reported more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A total of 2 provinces reported no new cases, 6 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases, and another 8 provinces reported less than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission.

https://aawsat.com/english/home/article/2259061/iran-death-toll-coronavirus-outbreak-reaches-5957


The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in Iran rose by 80 in the past 24 hours to 5957, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV on [Wed 29 Apr 2020].

The total number of diagnosed cases of new coronavirus in Iran, one of the countries hardest hit by the outbreak in the Middle East, has reached 93,657, he said.

Earlier on [Tue 28 Apr 2020]., Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Iranians should be cautious but not afraid of the coronavirus. This came as the country eases restrictions in an attempt to return to normal life, Reuters reported.

"Excessive fear, excessive anxiety, excessive worrying is worse than this corona itself and this virus and can really break up people's lives and take away people's comfort," Rouhani said, according to the official presidency website.

Iranians have returned to shops, bazaars and parks over the past week as the country eases coronavirus restrictions, with the daily increase in the death toll below 100 since [14 Apr 2020].

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 1 046 396, including 61 668 deaths, an increase from 1 035 765 cases and 59 266 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 306 158 (29.1%) cumulative case reports and 4708 (13.6%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing.

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (2408 -- 10.5% of total), California (2583 -- 4.6%), Illinois (2253 -- 8.7%), Pennsylvania (712 -- 7.3%), Massachusetts (1963 -- 7.2%), and Michigan (1137 -- 4.1%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, and Connecticut.

Repeating from yesterday (28 Apr 2020), more sobering, if you treat each state like a country and insert them in descending cumulative case counts, New York state would be number 1 followed by Spain, Italy, France, the UK, Germany, Turkey, New Jersey, Russia, and Iran as number 10. Number 11 would be China, 12 Brazil, 13 Massachusetts, 14 Canada, 13 Illinois, 14 Belgium, 15 California, 16 Pennsylvania, 17 Michigan, 18 Netherlands, 19 Florida, and 20 India. 8 US states are in the top 20 in terms of cumulative case counts (concept from - Mod.LXL).

The US military has confirmed 6648 cumulative cases, with no newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 8274 cumulative cases and 793 new cases today (29 Apr 2020). There have been 1877 cases reported from federal prisons (229 new cases in the past 24 hours) and 1873 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (104 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours). Puerto Rico has reported 1433 cases (33 new cases in the past 24 hours).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has a growth curve and a table giving demographics (age and ethnicity) where known.

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496) Spain will be reporting only PCR positive confirmations and not antibody based, effective 25 Apr 2020. The antibody confirmed cases are shown in the graph accompanying Table 1, but tabular form showing data by province is not available.

That being said, Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 2144 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours bringing the PCR confirmed cumulative total to 212 917 as compared with 210 733 PCR confirmed cases yesterday (28 Apr 2020).

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 86.29, a continual slow decrease over the past 22 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 86.29 today (29 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 212 917 cases, approximately 115 845 (54.4% have been hospitalized; a major increase from 80 150 in the past 48 hours) and 10 721 (5.0%) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data). Caution should be taken in interpreting this rise due to the decreased denominator.

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7284979,43. Madrid, Catalonia, and Castile and Leon are now the most affected communities by population-based rates. Castile and Leon is located in the northern part of the country and Catalonia in the north east. Madrid is located in central Spain, with Castile and Leon to its northwest and Catalonia to its northeast. - Mod.UBA]
