[The discrepancy in case numbers and even departments in various reports should not be surprising in this rapidly-moving outbreak. Suspected cases have to be identified, blood samples taken and sent to the reference laboratory in Bogota, tests conducted there, and results disseminated. All this takes time. Meanwhile, the virus moves along.

Laboratory confirmation is essential, because the symptoms of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue viruses are similar enough that diagnosis on clinical grounds is difficult, and these viruses are all co-circulating in the departments mentioned. The Vice Minister's earlier statement is likely to be correct -- Zika virus will probably spread to 17 departments, all of which have _Aedes aegypti_ populations abundant enough to transmit these viruses. It will be interesting to see whether Zika virus spreads to the neighboring countries of Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and Panama.
