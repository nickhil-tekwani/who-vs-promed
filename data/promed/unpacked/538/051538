Recently, some US residents returning from Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico were diagnosed with infections caused by an antibiotic-resistant form of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ bacteria.

All of the travelers with this particular infection had an invasive medical procedure performed in Tijuana. Most (but not all) of them had weight-loss surgery. About half of those infected had their surgery done at the Grand View Hospital.

Based on information provided by the CDC, the Mexican government has closed the Grand View Hospital until further notice.

CDC recommends that travelers to Tijuana, Mexico not have surgery at the Grand View Hospital until the Mexican government can confirm that the drug-resistant form of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ bacteria is no longer there.

CDC has received reports of serious drug-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ infections in US residents who had invasive medical procedures (primarily weight-loss surgery) in Tijuana, Mexico. About half of those infected with these bacteria had surgery at Grand View Hospital, Tijuana. The others became infected after surgery at other hospitals and clinics. Infections caused by this particular drug-resistant _Pseudomonas_ are rare in the United States and difficult to treat.

CDC recommends that travelers to Mexico not have surgery (including weight-loss surgery) at Grand View Hospital in Tijuana until the Mexican government can confirm that the drug-resistant form of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ bacteria is no longer there.

Additional information and advice for US residents planning to travel abroad for medical care:

- Some people who have traveled for medical care to countries outside the United States have been infected by hard-to-treat antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria not commonly seen in the United States.
- Medical and surgical procedures done anywhere (even in the United States) carry some risk and can result in complications.
- See a travel medicine specialist in the United States at least a month before your trip. Travel medicine specialists can provide you with the guidance, vaccines, and medicines you may need for your travel.
- Ask your doctor if you are healthy enough to travel abroad for medical or surgical procedures.
- Research the health care provider who will perform your procedure, as well as the clinic or hospital where you will be receiving care. Be aware that standards for providers and clinics abroad may be different from those in the United States.
- Look for clinics and hospitals accredited by international organizations. Remember that using an internationally accredited facility is not a guarantee that your medical care will be free of complications.
- Ask the clinic or hospital to provide you with copies of all of your medical records. If possible, these records should be in English. Bring them with you to any follow-up appointments you have.
- Anytime you travel outside the country, consider the health and safety concerns at your destination. Also consider the additional risks posed by traveling after surgery:
- Any prolonged travel after surgery increases your risk of developing blood clots in your legs. Avoid traveling for at least 10 days after surgery on your chest or abdomen (belly). The American Society of Plastic Surgeons recommends that patients wait to fly at least 7-10 days after having cosmetic procedures on the face or after laser treatments.
- Consider the risks of participating in typical vacation activities after surgery. Avoid sunbathing, drinking alcohol, swimming, taking long tours, or participating in strenuous activities or exercise.

If you think you have an infection or other complication, seek medical care immediately. Regardless of where you received care, tell your health care provider about your travel and any medical care or surgery you had abroad.

- US health care providers should be vigilant for the possibility of resistant infections occurring in patients who have traveled abroad for medical procedures. Take measures to control the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms in the United States.
- Providers caring for patients with a history of invasive procedures in Mexico should be aware of the potential for infections caused by resistant pathogens.

The pathogen implicated in the current cluster of infections is carbapenem-resistant _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ (CRPA). The resistance mechanism is a metallo-beta-lactamase encoded by a mobile genetic element known as the Verona integron [VIM]. CRPA are drug-resistant and difficult to treat, requiring protracted and complex antibacterial drug combinations and courses. Consult with an infectious disease specialist.

- When caring for patients who have a history of having undergone invasive procedures in Mexico, obtain cultures, perform antimicrobial susceptibility testing to guide treatment, and test any carbapenem-resistant bacteria for Verona integron and other plasmid-mediated carbapenemases. Report any CRPA surgical site infections in patients who had invasive procedures in Mexico to your local or state health department.
- When admitting patients who have a history of overnight stays in health care facilities outside the United States, consider performing rectal screening for carbapenemase-producing organisms. This recommendation applies to patients hospitalized outside the United States at any time during the 6 months before their US-based hospital admission.
- Consider placing such patients in isolation and contact precautions while awaiting screening results.
- Mechanism testing for carbapenem-resistant bacteria and rectal screening for carbapenemases are available free of charge via the Antibiotic Resistance Laboratory Network (https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/solutions-initiative/ar-lab-network.html), which can be accessed through state health department health care-associated infections programs (https://www.cdc.gov/hai/state-based/index.html).

[Acquisition of pathogens that are uncommon in the home country is a known risk of travel for the specific purpose of obtaining health care abroad (medical tourism) (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/the-pre-travel-consultation/medical-tourism). Medical tourism has been associated with nontuberculous mycobacteria infections among patients who had cosmetic surgery in the Dominican Republic (ProMED-mail post Non-TB mycobacteria - USA: ex Dominican Rep, M. abscessus/chelonae, post-surgery 20170625.5130300) and Q fever among patients who received sheep cell injections in Germany (ProMED-mail post Q fever - Germany: (RP) sheep cell therapy, 2014 20170416.4974554), as well as NDM beta-lactamase-producing organisms in patients who had received medical care in India (ProMED-mail post NDM-1 carrying Enterobacteriaceae (04): Taiwan ex India 20101005.3604). A travel history should be an essential component of a thorough medical examination.

Carbapenems are a class of beta-lactam antibiotics that includes ertapenem, doripenem, imipenem, and meropenem. Carbapenems historically have been antibiotics of last resort to treat many infections due to carbapenem-sensitive, but otherwise multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli, such as those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) or AmpC beta-lactamases, which are enzymes that destroy most beta-lactams, except for the carbapenems. Unfortunately, the worldwide spread of genes that encode resistance to the carbapenems is threatening the usefulness of these drugs.

Resistance to carbapenems commonly is the result of an organism acquiring the ability to produce carbapenemases, enzymes that can destroy the carbapenems, as well as most other beta-lactam antibiotics. There are 2 types of carbapenemases: metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL), which use zinc ions at their active sites to catalyze the hydrolysis of beta-lactam antibiotics, and serine beta-lactamases, which use serine at the active site. NDM (New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamases -1, -2, -3, -4, etc.), IMP (imipenemase), and VIM (Verona integron-encoded metallo-beta-lactamases) are MBL. KPCs (_Klebsiella pneumoniae_ carbapenemases -1, -2, -3, -4, etc.) and OXA-types (oxacillin-hydrolyzing carbapenemases) are serine carbapenemases.

KPCs are the most common carbapenemases in the US but have also been reported worldwide. Many of the carbapenemases are encoded on mobile genetic elements, that is, pieces of DNA that can easily spread from one organism to another of the same or even different bacterial species. These mobile genetic elements frequently carry genes that confer resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, so that carbapenemase-producing organisms have been susceptible only to a few toxic or otherwise suboptimal antibiotics, such as colistin and tigecycline.

MBLs are now emerging as a global threat. MBL-producing strains are endemic within the community in many Asian countries, have successfully spread worldwide, and account for many significant carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) outbreaks. The above CDC Alert warns of an outbreak of healthcare-acquired infections in Tijuana Mexico due to a VIM-producing _Pseudomonas aeroginosa_.

Several types of MBL enzymes have been identified in _P. aeruginosa_. VIM enzymes occur mostly in _P. aeruginosa_, and rarely in Enterobacteriaceae. There are more than 40 VIM variants.

ProMED-mail has posted on nosocomial infections in Belgium due to VIM 2-producing _Pseudomonas aeroginosa_ in the past (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, carbapenem resistant - Belgium Archive Number: 20070119.0257). The isolates from Belgium were frequently multidrug resistant but remained susceptible to colistin.

The above report does not specify the number or types of infection caused by the VIM-producing _P. aeruginosa_, how the affected patients were treated, or the outcome of these infections. Neither are we told the VIM type found or the antibiotic susceptibilities of the Tijuana isolates. Nor are we told whether genetic analysis of the clinical isolates has been done; matching genotypes of clinical isolates would imply a common source, and matching genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates would establish transmission pathways.

More information on this outbreak is likely to be forthcoming as the epidemiologic investigation proceeds. - Mod.ML
