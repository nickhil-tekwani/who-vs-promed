Outbreak of rare eye ailment suspected in city
----------------------------------------------
A city hospital has reported 7 cases of an extremely rare form of
conjunctivitis (Madras eye) which, if untreated, can cause blindness
in 20 percent of patients. Found in less than 100 people since it was
first detected in 1973, microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis is far
more severe than the usual Madras eye and can last for more than a
week.

"Seven cases of keratoconjunctivitis is too big, considering less
than 100 such cases have been reported from across the world in
medical literature, though more than 60 percent of it was from
Orissa," said cornea and refractive surgery consultant Dr. Anand
Parathasarathy, of Vasan Eye Care Hospital. "We have reasons to
suspect an outbreak," said consultant ophthalmologist Dr.
Venkararaman Arvind.

When a woman walked into the hospital with redness and irritation of
eye, it was mistaken for ordinary conjunctivitis. But when the
redness did not reduce even after a week and when the patient had
loose bowel movement, doctors decided to do a corneal smear (eye
tissue is scraped out and observed under a microscope). They were
surprised to find a protozoa, instead of a virus or bacteria that
cause conjunctivitis, and inflammation of the conjunctiva (the
outermost layer of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids).
There were ulcers on the eye. That is when they confirmed it as
microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis.

In the next 14 days, one person tested positive for the infection
every alternate day. All patients were in between 25 and 36 years old
and from areas like Alandur and Pazhavanthangal.

[Microsporidia spp. are related to fungi and are found in almost all
animals and insects and include more than 600 genotypes. They are
very small, intracellular organisms which in humans have been
described primarily in immunocompromised hosts. Because of their
small size they are very difficult to identify by light microscopy
and in humans a trichrome stain is the methods of choice for
microscopy. The present message contain no details of the method of
diagnosis, but a case series on presumed Microsporidia
keratoconjunctivitis based on microscopy of corneal scrapping has
been described from India (Das S et al. Br J Ophthalmol.
2008;92:861-2 and from the same group Joseph J et al. Ophthalmology.
2006;113:531-7).

Because Microsporidia are so difficult to identify by light
microscopy it would be appropriate before accepting that it is a
common cause of keratoconjunctivitis in immunocompetent humans to
confirm the finding with other methods, for instance PCR, which has
been described (Chan & Koh Parasitology. 2008;135:701-3). More
information would be appreciated. - Mod.EP]
