Turkey recorded 54 740 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, health ministry data showed late on Wednesday [7 Apr 2021], the highest daily cases since the start of the pandemic. The latest daily death toll was 276, also the highest since the start of the outbreak, bringing the cumulative toll to 32 943.

Turkey has carried out nearly 17.97 million vaccine inoculations, with some 10.55 million people receiving a 1st dose, since it began the nationwide rollout of COVID-19 shots on 14 Jan 2021, health ministry data showed.

In late March [2021], President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced a tightening of coronavirus restrictions, including the return of full nationwide weekend lockdowns during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which starts on 13 Apr 2021.

Out of the country's 81 provinces, 58 are marked as "red" or "very high-risk" zones, including the cultural and economic hub of Istanbul and the national capital, Ankara.

Communal meals during the holy month of Ramadan observed by Muslims have been prohibited, as was the case last year [2020]. Mass gatherings in tents and other places for the pre-dawn and after-dusk meals will also not be allowed. Furthermore, restaurants and cafes across the country will be closed during Ramadan.

Daily overnight curfews remain in place from 9 pm (18:00 GMT) to 5 am (02:00 GMT).

[From Axios: "Cases are rising just about everywhere, in a swift reversal from early February 2021, when they were falling on every continent. They're also now ticking up in the USA, which is in the midst of a race between vaccines and variants.

"Brazil is recording by far the world's highest daily death tolls, which far exceed anything seen earlier in the pandemic. Hospitals are at or exceeding capacity in nearly every state, AP reports. A new, more contagious 'Brazilian variant' poses a grave threat, including to the USA.

"Nairobi, Kenya has entered a partial lockdown, with schools and bars closed and domestic travel halted. Recorded cases and deaths in Kenya remain relatively low, but high test positivity rates and surging hospital admissions have alarmed the government" (https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-cases-rising-around-world-europe-india-7e3e9d42-4eba-4b16-8a35-490e6f7a864c.html).

[2] B.1.1.7 variant dominant strain in USA
Date: Wed 7 Apr 2021 13:14 EDT
Source: National Public Radio (NPR) / All Things Considered [edited]
https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/04/07/985079617/cdc-says-more-virulent-british-strain-of-coronavirus-now-dominant-in-u-s


A more easily spread coronavirus variant first identified in England last year [2020] has now become the dominant strain in the USA, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said Wednesday [7 Apr 2021]. The variant, known as B.1.1.7, spread quickly across the United Kingdom and Ireland beginning last fall, with the more infectious version of the coronavirus thwarting restrictions and lockdowns that had earlier helped keep the original strain in check.

B.1.1.7 is "now the most common lineage circulating in the United States," CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a White House media briefing on Wednesday [7 Apr 2021]. The announcement comes as the number of cases -- particularly among younger Americans -- has been on the rise in the USA, fueling fears that the nation may be facing yet another deadly surge.

Walensky said that the newer strain has been shown to be more transmissible among younger people and that new outbreaks in the USA have been linked to youth sports and day care centers. She urged people not to let their guard down and to get vaccinated as soon as possible.

She said that communities and states with high levels of transmission need to curtail or suspend sports activities for younger participants to contain the spread of the new strain. She also said large events in affected communities needed to be curtailed. "The virus still has a hold on us," she said. "We need to remain vigilant."

The CDC warned in January [2021] that B.1.1.7 would likely become the dominant strain of SARS-CoV-2 -- the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19 -- in the USA by the end of March. Based on evidence gathered in the UK, "it was predicted that this SARS-CoV-2 variant would dominate the USA within a matter of weeks. The prediction was indeed correct and confirms that the work done in the UK was excellent," Jeremy Luban, a biochemist at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, said in an email to NPR.

Studies have suggested that the variant is about 50% more transmissible than the strain of the coronavirus first identified in China in December 2019. Luban said that this could explain the sudden increase in cases in the United States. "That being said, the more likely problem is that many states have opened up restaurants and other public indoor spaces, places where transmission rates are highest," he said.

The fact that the B.1.1.7 strain is more easily spread gives it the potential to kill more people. "If you then crank that exponential growth up to a steeper curve, you very quickly start infecting many, many, many more people than you would have beforehand," epidemiologist Emma Hodcroft at the University of Bern in Switzerland said in January [2021].

There is also evidence that this variant makes people sicker, says William Hanage, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University. Hanage said it was "inevitable" that the B.1.1.7 variant would become the dominant strain in the USA but expressed some optimism about the timing. "[A]t least this is happening at a point when we have a decent amount of vaccination even if it is nowhere near enough to control B.1.1.7 on its own," he wrote in an email to NPR.

Hanage said 2 factors were driving down the mean age of hospitalizations in the USA: "the 1st is that older adults are vaccinated and so less likely to wind up in hospital." The 2nd factor, he said, "is that the younger age-groups now being infected with B.1.1.7 are more likely to have severe disease because the variant is more virulent."

The USA leads the world with nearly 31 million confirmed coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic, with 556 000 deaths due to COVID-19.

[Interesting that "5 US states have nearly 50% of cases (NY, MI, Fl, PA, NJ) but those states do not overlap cleanly with the states that have the highest prevalence of B117 or other variants of concern in the US (CA, CO, MN, MI, NH, FL) as shown to us by this CDC map (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html). ...each state's cases probably reflective of their natural immunity (high in CA, TX after 3rd surge; low in MI as not as large surges) + vaccination rate," tweeted Monica Gandhi (https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1379661028041007106.html). Thus, B.1.1.7 may not signify a dire situation ahead. The total picture must be taken into account, including the variant's increased transmissibility, degree of increased virulence, and how well it can escape immunity from your vaccine (or natural infection). - Mod.LK]

[The source of primary data to support the statement, that B.1.1.7 is "now the most common lineage circulating in the United States," is not immediately apparent. The CDC table of U.S. COVID-19 cases caused by variants shows 19,554 cases of B.1.1.7 reported as of April 8 https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/transmission/variant-cases.html, and thus the total number of reported B.1.1.7 cases reported thus far is only about one-fourth of the current rough number of new daily cases of COVID-19 in the U.S.A.

One source of quantitative tracking of circulating COVID variants is the CoVariants website https://covariants.org, based on GISAID data https://www.gisaid.org/, which has very useful information about many variants of interest, including a list of the defining mutations, links to publications, distribution by country, and 3D protein models. For B.1.1.7, see https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V1. For the U.S.A., B.1.1.7 (also called 501Y.V1) was in fact the most common strain sequence for the week of 22 Mar 2021, constituting 34% of a total of 927 GISAID sequences https://covariants.org/per-country. One caveat about these variant sequence data is that they are based on sequences submitted to GISAID, so they are not a random sampling and are based on a limited number of sequences, the number of which varies significantly from week to week. As stated on the CoVariants per-country webpage, "It's important not to assume frequencies shown are necessarily representative of the country." -Mod.LXL]

[3] COVID and mental health
Date: Tue 6 Apr 2021

One in 3 COVID-19 survivors received a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis within 6 months of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, an observational study of more than 230 000 patient health records published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal estimates. The study looked at 14 neurological and mental health disorders (1 [see source URL for full references and notes]).

Professor Paul Harrison, lead author of the study, from the University of Oxford, UK, said: "These are real-world data from a large number of patients. They confirm the high rates of psychiatric diagnoses after COVID-19 and show that serious disorders affecting the nervous system (such as stroke and dementia) occur too. While the latter are much rarer, they are significant, especially in those who had severe COVID-19 (2).

"Although the individual risks for most disorders are small, the effect across the whole population may be substantial for health and social care systems due to the scale of the pandemic and that many of these conditions are chronic. As a result, healthcare systems need to be resourced to deal with the anticipated need, both within primary and secondary care services" (2).

Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, there has been growing concern that survivors might be at increased risk of neurological disorders. A previous observational study by the same research group reported that COVID-19 survivors are at increased risk of mood and anxiety disorders in the first 3 months after infection (3). However, until now, there have been no large-scale data examining the risks of neurological as well as psychiatric diagnoses in the 6 months after COVID-19 infection.

This latest study analysed data from the electronic health records of 236 379 COVID-19 patients from the US-based TriNetX network, which includes more than 81 million people. Patients who were older than 10 years and who became infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus after 20 Jan 2020, and were still alive on 13 Dec 2020, were included in the analysis. This group was compared with 105 579 patients diagnosed with influenza and 236 038 patients diagnosed with any respiratory tract infection (including influenza).

Overall, the estimated incidence of being diagnosed with a neurological or mental health disorder following COVID-19 infection was 34%. For 13% of these people, it was their 1st recorded neurological or psychiatric diagnosis.

The most common diagnoses after COVID-19 were anxiety disorders (occurring in 17% of patients), mood disorders (14%), substance misuse disorders (7%), and insomnia (5%). The incidence of neurological outcomes was lower, including 0.6% for brain haemorrhage, 2.1% for ischaemic stroke, and 0.7% for dementia (see table 2 [at https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(20)30462-4/fulltext]).

Risks of a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis were greatest in, but not limited to, patients who had severe COVID-19. Compared to the overall 34% incidence, a neurological or psychiatric diagnosis occurred in 38% of those who had been admitted to hospital, 46% of those in intensive care, and 62% in those who had delirium (encephalopathy) during their COVID-19 infection. This gradient of risk applied to individual disorders too. For example, 2.7% of people needing intensive care and 3.6% of people with encephalopathy had a brain haemorrhage (compared to 0.3% in people without hospitalisation); 6.9% and 9.4% had ischaemic stroke (compared to 1.3% without hospitalisation); 1.7% and 4.7% developed dementia (0.4% without hospitalisation); and 2.8% and 7% were diagnosed with a psychotic disorder (0.9% without hospitalisation) (see table 2).

The authors also looked at people who experienced flu and other respiratory tract infections over the same time frame to help understand whether these neurological and mental health complications were linked specifically to COVID-19. After taking into account underlying health characteristics, such as age, sex, ethnicity, and existing health conditions, there was overall a 44% greater risk of neurological and mental health diagnoses after COVID-19 than after flu, and a 16% greater risk after COVID-19 than with respiratory tract infections. As a result, the authors say that COVID-19 does lead to a greater risk of neurological and psychiatric disorders than these other health conditions. However, this was not seen for all conditions; there was no clear evidence that COVID-19 led to an increased risk of parkinsonism or and Guillain-Barre syndrome.

Dr. Max Taquet, a co-author of the study, from the University of Oxford, UK, said: "Our results indicate that brain diseases and psychiatric disorders are more common after COVID-19 than after flu or other respiratory infections, even when patients are matched for other risk factors. We now need to see what happens beyond 6 months. The study cannot reveal the mechanisms involved but does point to the need for urgent research to identify these, with a view to preventing or treating them" (2).

The authors note several limitations to their study. Firstly, the completeness and accuracy of the electronic health records is not known. Secondly, many people with COVID-19 have mild or no symptoms and do not present for health care; therefore, the people studied here are likely to have been more severely affected than in the general population. Thirdly, the severity and course of the neurological and psychiatric disorders is not known.

Writing in a linked Comment article, Dr. Jonathan Rogers, who was not involved in the study, from University College London (UCL), UK, said: "[this] study points us towards the future, both in its methods and implications. Researchers need to be able to observe and anticipate the neurological and psychiatric outcomes of future emerging health threats by use of massive, international, real-world clinical data. Selection biases will remain an issue, not necessarily mitigated by sample size, and thus the onus should be on countries with public health-care systems to enable truly comprehensive national data to be available for research. Sadly, many of the disorders identified in this study tend to be chronic or recurrent, so we can anticipate that the impact of COVID-19 could be with us for many years."

[4] Chile: surge in cases
Date: Tue 6 Apr 2021 08:52 EDT
Source: El Pais [in Spanish, translated and summarized by Pablo Nart Peñalver, edited]
https://elpais.com/sociedad/2021-04-06/por-que-los-casos-de-covid-19-son-record-en-chile-cuando-el-pais-tiene-el-45-de-su-poblacion-vacunada.html


Chile is going through the worst time of the pandemic, with more than 8000 daily infections in recent days and a record of ICU occupancy, despite that 45% of the population, 7 of the 19 million inhabitants, have received at least a dose of the vaccine, according to the latest data provided by the Minister of Health, Enrique Paris. This wave has been higher than the peak of the 1st wave registered in June [2020] and growing much more quickly. An excess of public confidence, derived from the rapid vaccination campaign, and that the new variants were already present at the time of the vaccination campaign are singled as possible causes for the increase in cases.

"...Last year [2020] it took us 3 months to climb the hill and now we have reached the same point, even higher, in just a month," says Gabriel Cavada, biostatistician at the School of Public Health of the University of Chile. "We are climbing it too fast, 3 times as much, according to the charts," he adds.

"Only the positive aspects of the campaign have been highlighted but not the dangers that remain," analyses the doctor Mauricio Canals, a member of the ICOVID platform, an initiative led by the University of Chile, the Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile and the Universidad de Concepcion, based on official data...he lists the factors that would have caused the new wave. "After the summer [2020], in March [2021] the activities began with practically no restrictions. Quarantines were never effective, population mobility increased considerably." With the opening of schools and shopping centers, in his opinion, the wrong message was delivered to the public.

The Chilean Executive managed to stock up on vaccines like no other country in the region and, thanks to its strong primary health system, it has been able to deploy a speedy campaign and one of the most successful in the world. But it has not been able to stop the infections: in 13 months, they exceed one million and there are currently 2883 admitted to ICUs, the maximum in the pandemic, with only 164 critical beds available nationwide.

Doctor Canals added: "The (vaccine-induced) immune status...has not covered the population that is transmitting the disease, which is between 30 and 60 years. It is a group that is just beginning to have a little immunity these days"...(that's why), the age of the people who occupy the ICU beds has been changing. Today [6 Apr 2021], according to official data, there are more hospitalized between 40 and 49 years (469), than those over 70 (378). The latter slightly outnumber the youngest (359 admitted under the age of 39). But the fatality rate has not decreased and remains at 2.4%.... "Unlike the 1st wave of 2020, when younger people with severe courses of the disease enter the ICU, they spend more time in the complex bed and the ventilator."

Projections made by Gabriel Cavada (for the current surge) warn of the possibility of reaching up to 300 000 new infections. "As we climb this hill so fast, my hope is that the descent will also be fast, but I have no evidence to support it," he explains.

(At present) Chile has 23 677 deaths confirmed by PCR, although the Ministry of Health reports 31 151 probable deaths without laboratory confirmation of the diagnosis. "Is a terrible situation, the number deaths confirmed by PCR could reach between 30 000 and 35 000 (persons)," explains the epidemiologist, while the non PCR-confirmed "could reach about 45 000" [resulting in a ratio between 163 and 237 deaths per 100 000 habitants; for comparison the UK ratio stands at 190. - PNP].

[The above article was kindly submitted to ProMED by Pablo Nart Peñalver (initials PNP) in response to a recent post concerning COVID-19 in Chile (COVID-19 update (119): Chile, indoor transmission risk, WHO, global 20210331.8281129), in which Mod.LM commented "Chile represents a good case study showing that widespread vaccination at modest levels, similar to that now seen in the US, do not by themselves prevent surging COVID-19 cases." Dr. Nart Peñalver also provides the following additional articles with commentary:

A recent paper by Moore et al. (Vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study. Lancet Infect Dis. https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(21)00143-2/fulltext) calculating the impact of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in the UK reported that there's still the possibility to get very many hospitalisations and deaths even if vaccine uptake and efficacy were highly significant.

In their findings the authors say: "We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions), even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85% of infections, we estimate R to be 1.58 (95% credible intervals [CI] 1.36-1.84) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21  400 deaths (95% CI 1400-55  100) due to COVID-19."

Similar predictions, if restrictions are lifted too quickly, were published in February 2021 by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, a British Government advisory body. The following is abridged from The New European, authored by Jonathan Read (https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/brexit-news/westminster-news/coronavirus-lockdown-lifting-7659572):

"SAGE scientists fear 'fresh wave' of coronavirus cases by July: Summarising what the papers show, the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said: 'The modelling lays out a series of scenarios. None of them are the precise ones which the government ultimately decided to go for, but they lie between those options and that's the point of the modelling to lay out scenarios, not to point to a single answer.'

"He continued: 'Vaccines are predicted -- as you'd expect and hope -- to make a big difference.'

"Professor Dame Angela McLean, chief scientific adviser for the Ministry of Defence, added: 'If you unlock more slowly, the peak that you get is less high. And I think all of us feel that would be a good thing. It's common sense why that happens, there remain people who have either been not vaccinated, or even though these vaccines are absolutely fantastic, they are not perfect -- so there are people who have been vaccinated who nevertheless are not protected from very severe disease. So if we're to let a big epidemic happen among younger people, then some of those vulnerable older people, or people who are vulnerable for another reason, will get infected and will become very ill.'

"In a Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) document dated 17 Feb 2021, modelling by the University of Warwick and Imperial College London is set out and says that even under the most optimistic set of assumptions, at least a further 30 000 Covid-19 deaths could occur. Under some of the models, such as with a rapid relaxation of rules, further death figures would reach well over 100 000.

"It continues: 'There is the potential for a resurgence to result in a very large number of infections (3rd wave) if restrictions are lifted early or rapidly which would lead to large numbers of hospitalisations and deaths unless vaccine coverage is very high.'"

Dr. Nart Peñalver writes in conclusion, "It is thus likely that we may need to learn to live with a significant degree of mortality and morbidity among those unvaccinated or not totally protected by the vaccines, unless stricter non pharmaceutical interventions are considered feasible or desirable." -Mod.LXL]

Epidemic situation of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Yunnan Province on 8 Apr 2021
As of 8 Apr 2021 24:00, the province has 87 confirmed cases (imported 3 cases, local 84 cases) and asymptomatic infection 44 cases (imported 19 cases, local 25 cases) were isolated in designated medical institutions for treatment and medical observation.

8 new confirmed cases:
Confirmed case 1: Female, 26 years old, Chinese nationality, common type
Confirmed case 2: Female, 44 years old, Chinese nationality, common type
Confirmed case 3: Female, 47 years old, Chinese nationality, common type
Confirmed case 4: Male, 34 years old, Chinese nationality, common type
Confirmed case 5: Female, 38 years old, Chinese nationality, common type
Confirmed case 6: Female, 36 years old, Thai nationality, common type
Confirmed case 7: Male, 29 years old, Chinese nationality, common type
Confirmed case 8: Female, 36 years old, Chinese nationality, mild

The above-mentioned cases were all discovered in the 2nd round of nucleic acid tests for all employees in Ruili City, which were transported to designated medical institutions by negative pressure ambulances, combined with epidemiological history, clinical manifestations and laboratory test results, and diagnosed as confirmed cases of novel coronavirus pneumonia.

[According to the situation report of the China National Health Commission dated 8 Apr 2021, from 0-24:00 on 7 Apr 2021, there were 11 local cases in China, all in Yunnan http://www.nhc.gov.cn/xcs/yqtb/202104/ed07471bac3946ce8f2c0e5ea1901173.shtml. Yunnan province has a disproportionately high number of the total current COVID-19 cases in China. Yunnan is also where the bat coronavirus that is most closely related to the SARS-CoV-2 was identified several years before the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, Yunnan is one of the main provinces where wildlife animal farming (of minks, fox, raccoon dogs, and others) has been promoted. The article above says that the 8 new cases were all detected in Ruili City employees; if these tests were performed as part of routine screening, it would suggest that there may be many more cases in the community. Ruili is in the westernmost part of Yunnan, bordering Burma (in fact, it was a waystation on the historic Burma Road), and has a large population of Dai and other ethnic minority groups (sometimes called "hill tribes"), and presumably sees relatively more cross-border traffic. -Mod.LXL]
