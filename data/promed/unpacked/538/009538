Bird Flu claims 2 lives in Mansera
----------------------------------
For the first time in the history of Pakistan, Bird Flu influenza has
been confirmed among human beings after 2 brothers died at a local
hospital in Peshawar.

According to a spokesman of the Health Ministry, 2 brothers working in
a poultry farm in Mansera suffered flu a few days back that later
turned [out] to be critical in the form of Bird Flu influenza (H5N1).
They were admitted to a local hospital in Peshawar where on Monday [10
Dec 2007] they died.

After the blood samples of both the brothers were sent for formal
testing in a Laboratory, it was found that both brothers died due to
Bird Flu virus (H5N1).

It is [worth] mentioning that this is the first case of human loss in
the history of Pakistan where a person died due to Bird Flu. On the
other hand, the spokesman of the Health Ministry confirmed the death
due to Bird Flu adding both the brothers were working in a poultry
farm in Mansera and had direct links with the chickens that resulted
in the transformation [transmission?] of the virus (H5N1).

It may be recalled that 208 people lost their lives around the world
due to the virus (H5NI). Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, China, Vietnam,
Egypt & South Asian States are among the bird flu affected countries.
