Equine influenza spreads in the UK
----------------------------------
Equine influenza has spread to nearly 20 premises -- mostly thoroughbred
training stables -- in the United Kingdom, and it has been detected in the
eastern, central, and southern parts of the country. "The reason (it's
unusual) is that, despite the fact that horses have been very well
vaccinated and have very high antibody levels, they are still becoming
infected with this strain of virus," according to James Wood, head of
epidemiology at the Animal Health Trust in the UK. He said no racetracks
have been affected by the illness.
Influenza, while typically not life-threatening, can make a horse
uncomfortable and vulnerable to other diseases. Infected horses usually
require a minimum of 3 to 4 weeks of rest to avoid long term respiratory
problems. Affected horses spread the virus via aerosol droplets or fomites
(any objects capable of mechanically transporting an infectious agent, such
as brushes or buckets). Horses exposed to transient populations, those
stressed by shipping or heavy training schedules, young horses, and seniors
are most at risk of contracting influenza. Signs in the current outbreak
have included acute coughing, mainly during exercise, and some horses have
developed nasal discharge. Fever has been seen, but is not a consistent
sign. It's difficult to ascertain how many horses have been exposed to
influenza, but veterinarians have continued to sample populations to try
and determine the extent of its spread. Wood said 18 to 20 premises are
currently affected.
Wood explained that the centralized disease reporting system in the UK has
been advantageous because all laboratory influenza diagnoses on UK samples
are made at the Animal Health Trust. It can be difficult to tally accurate
numbers of disease cases when many different diagnostic laboratories are
being used, or if there are multiple disease-reporting systems in a
country. That is not the case in the United Kingdom. "We work very closely
with the industry to try and control these diseases," he said.

[2 subtypes of influenza A virus are known to cause influenza in horses,
namely the subtypes H7N7 (formerly known as A/equine 1) and H3N8 (formerly
known as A/equine 2). In recent years, most outbreaks have been associated
with the H3N8 subtype, however serological evidence of H7N7 infections
continues to be reported.
Although these are not genuine human pathogens, humans can become infected
with equine influenza virus subtypes. Such infections are unusual and
subclinical, but may represent a potential biohazard to laboratory
personnel. An avian influenza strain of H7N7 subtype virus has recently
caused human infections in the Netherlands.
Information on equine influenza vaccines are available in CHAPTER 2.5.5. of
the Manual of standards, Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines 2000 of the OIE
<http://www.oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/A_00073.htm> and on the equiflunet:
<http://195.224.162.216/equiflunet/equiflunet_vaccines.html>. Data on the
virus subtype and strain, currently evolving in the UK "despite the fact
that horses have been very well vaccinated and have very high antibody
levels," will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
