Illinois state and local health officials report investigating 3 cases of Legionnaires' disease in individuals who were patients at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital.

One individual was an inpatient, and the 2nd and 3rd individuals had outpatient visits. These patients could have acquired the infection at the hospital, but they also had other possible sources of exposure during the 10 days before they started showing symptoms.

The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH), the DuPage County Health Department (DCHD), and the hospital are working to information and further investigate these cases, which will include another onsite visit by IDPH to test the facility's water. Central DuPage Hospital is working with IDPH to strengthen its water management plan and implement multiple control measures. The hospital has also taken actions outlined in its water management plan, including flushing the plumbing system.

The hospital is working to provide information to potentially impacted patients and employees about _Legionella_. IDPH recommended the hospital conduct surveillance to identify other potential cases and to ensure appropriate testing and clinical management.

[Winfield (2018, population 9690) is a village in DuPage County, Illinois, United States, about 30 mi [48 km] west of Chicago; it is home to Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital, one of the largest hospitals in the Chicago suburbs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winfield,_Illinois). Central DuPage Hospital (CDH) has 390 beds and is one of 7 hospitals operated by Northwestern Medicine. CDH is ranked 5th among Illinois hospitals in the 2017-18 U.S. News Best Hospitals Honor Roll rankings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_DuPage_Hospital). A map showing the location of Winfield can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Winfield,+IL.

_Legionella_ are gram-negative bacilli that are found in both natural freshwater environments, like lakes and streams, and in manufactured plumbing systems, such as showerheads and sink faucets, cooling towers, decorative fountains, hot tubs/spas, and hot water tanks and heaters. Warm water temperatures of 25-40 deg C [77-104 deg F] support the highest concentrations of the organism in plumbing systems.

Eradication of these bacteria from plumbing systems is often difficult. Long-term persistence within these water systems is favored by the intracellular location of _Legionella_ within several species of protozoa, where _Legionella_ replicate and which provide protection from environmental stressors, like biocides and heat treatment.

Also, the formation of biofilms allows adherence of _Legionella_ to the inner surfaces of the plumbing systems (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5835138/). _Legionella pneumophila_ have been shown to persist for long periods in biofilms in a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state after exposure to a biocide or heat treatment (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5515819/). Monitoring _L. pneumophila_ in water systems that is usually done by culture would miss VBNC _Legionella_, which can be revived by the subsequent addition of ameba (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18839249).

Debilitated hospitalized patients who are prone to aspiration may develop Legionnaires' disease following aspiration of _Legionella_-contaminated potable water, as well as inhaling a fine spray (aerosols) from water sources containing _Legionella_. Possible person-to-person transmission has also been described (Correia AM, Goncalves J, Gomes JP, et al.: Probable person-to-person transmission of Legionnaires' disease. N Engl J Med. 2016; 374(5): 497-8. http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1505356).

During the epidemiological and environmental investigation for the source of _Legionella_ organisms, patients should be prohibited from taking showers and should consume only sterile water until the source has been remediated.

Genotyping the clinical isolates from cases of Legionnaires' disease will help to establish whether this is a common source outbreak if the genotypes match. Matching the genotypes of clinical and environmental isolates of _Legionella_ will identify the environmental source for the individual cases. However, if the diagnoses were confirmed through urine antigen testing, there will be no clinical isolates for genotyping. The urine assay detects only _L. pneumophila_ serogroup 1 antigen. More information on this suspected outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
