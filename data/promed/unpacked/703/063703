The Ministry of Health has reported 33 cases of cholera (12 confirmed)
which have occurred since the last week of December 1997. The districts
most affected are Ayllo Solor, San Pedro de Atacama and Sequitor in the
north of the country (Antofagasta Region). These rural districts are
close to the border with Bolivia. Argentina, Bolivia and Peru have been
notified of the cases. The Ministry of Health has informed WHO that the
following measures are being implemented: reactivation of the Cholera
Coordinating Committee, health education on food safety, water treatment,
environmental sanitation, outbreak investigation and reinforcement of
epidemiological surveillance systems. Chile last reported cholera in 1996
when one imported case occurred, in 1994 when 1 case only occurred and in
1993 when 32 cases were reported.
