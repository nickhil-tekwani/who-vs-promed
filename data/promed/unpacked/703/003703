Lassa fever - Sierra Leone.
During the first four months of 1997 a total of 353 cases of Lassa fever
with 43 deaths (12.2.%) were reported. The number of cases increased from 45
with 7 deaths (15.6%) in January to 75 cases and 9 deaths (12.0%) in
February, and 147 cases with 20 deaths (13.4%) in March but decreased to 86
cases with 7 deaths (8.1%) in April. The resumption of civil unrest in
Kenema in late April and the brief closure of the Kenema hospital may have
adversely affected reporting. During 1996, a total of 470 cases with 110
deaths (23.4%) were reported. While the majority of cases sought medical
care in Kenema four cases were identified in Freetown. Initially, cases
seeking medical care in Freetown were transported to Kenema but an isolation
ward is now being established in Freetown using health staff trained at the
Lassa fever isolation ward in Kenema to ensure prompt management of suspect
cases.
The Ministry of Health and Sanitation together with WHO and MERLIN is
planning activities to prevent the spread of the disease and improve
management of suspect cases. Key district health personnel will be included
in a nation-wide training programme on Lassa fever control that is planned
for later in the year. The Ministry of Health and Sanitation is studying a
plan for rodent control. Treatment with ribavirin was resumed in mid-April
with the arrival of new supplies of the drug after the stock was depleted in
February. Ribavirin will be distributed to other areas where health
personnel are familiar with administration of this drug for the treatment of
Lassa fever. The Ministry of Health and Sanitation is also establishing a
national Lassa fever control programme with a programme manager based in
Kenema.
