The Northern Cape agriculture department has called in experts from
the Kruger National Park to assist with an anthrax outbreak in the
province, SABC news reported on Wednesday [26 Mar 2008]. The outbreak
was affecting wildlife and livestock in the Campbell area, 100
kilometres (62 miles) away from Kimberley.

Department spokesperson Thabo Mothibi said some farmers were
experiencing loses of up to 400 animals. He urged farmers to
vaccinate their high valued species.

"Once there is an indication that a particular animal may have died
from anthrax, or an anthrax-related disease, the best thing to do
would be to get into contact with the nearest state veterinarian or
animal technician. People should not open carcasses of animals they
suspect died of anthrax," Mothibi said. [Amen! - Mod.MHJ]

[It is a horrible fact of life that as anthrax becomes truly
sporadic, recognition of an outbreak falls right off with the result
that one sees an acute spike in the size of outbreaks because of
delayed recognition by owners and their veterinarian, and people do
foolish things, like field necropsies. When the surveillance slacks
off so does the push for vaccination of herds and flocks still at
risk. It can be a smooth transition to being essentially free but too
often it is a prolonged stumble.

Official statistics, vide ex OIE WAHID (World Animal Health
Information Database), will not reflect true number affected because
far too often these statistics are compiled from diagnostic
laboratory data, which only record samples received. If there are 100
dead sheep in an outbreak, only bits from one sheep got to the
laboratory, and the outbreak size is recorded as "one sheep", which
is nonsense. So a word of advice ... when checking the WAHID data,
which reflects an immense amount of hard work by the OIE staff in
Paris, when you see unitary cases take it as an indication that the
relevant national veterinary service HQ office may not really know
what is going on or won't admit it. Both apply far too often.
