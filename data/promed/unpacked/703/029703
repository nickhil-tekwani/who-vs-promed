More than 100 Suspected Norovirus Cases at Nursing Home
----------------------------------------------------------------
Norwalk virus or [a similar norovirus] is what sickened more than 100
nursing home residents and staffers here, public health investigators said
on Tue 17 Dec 2002. Results came back from samples taken at the Sparrow
Dimondale Nursing Center, where about 80 of the 170 residents have been
suffering from diarrhea, stomach pain, and vomiting this past week. Also,
67 out of 245 staffers were affected.
New cases at the center have slowed, but health officials continue to
monitor the facility and are hearing reports of the virus elsewhere in the
area, said Dean Sienko, medical director of the Barry-Eaton District Health
Department. "Things are slowing down, and we hope to continue to see that
trend," Sienko said. "But my sense, based on anecdotal reports, is
that here is a fair amount of norovirus-like activity in the community at
this time." Sienko said the virus may have surfaced in some area schools,
where administrators report more kids staying home with gastrointestinal
symptoms. The illness, although uncomfortable, isn't considered serious and
doesn't have to be reported to health officials.
The first case of the illness at the Dimondale center surfaced early last
week. It reached its peak at about 15 new cases a day late last week,
Sienko said. There have been only 2 new cases in the last couple of days.
Sparrow spokesman Russ Leonard-Whitman said the nursing center continues to
restrict visitors' access. Officials also are maintaining strengthened
hand-washing measures at the Dimondale facility and requiring workers to
change into work clothes when they arrive and change back before they leave.

British Columbia: Norovirus Infection May Be Moving to Battle Ground
--------------------------------------------------
Southwest Washington Health District officials said 2 residents of Parkway
North Care Center were experiencing vomiting, diarrhea and other symptoms
indicative of norovirus-like virus infection on Mon 16 Dec 2002. The health
district is working with Parkway North to deal with the illness as well as
conducting a full inspection of its food preparation facilities.
A similar sickness has sprinted through four Vancouver assisted living
centers since before Thanksgiving. The Health District has tallied 328
cases of [suspected norovirus illness] at the 4 centers since the first
sick call. The good news: The Vancouver portion of the outbreak has slowed
considerably. Just one resident and 2 staff at Bridgewood at Four Seasons
Retirement and Assisted Living Community were added to the sick list over
the weekend. Only one additional resident at Rose Vista Nursing Center has
contracted the illness since Friday.
Both the Van Mall Retirement Community and Hampton Alzheimer's Community,
meanwhile, escaped the weekend with no additional cases. Each dealt with
close to 100 norovirus infection sufferers among staff and residents
earlier in the outbreak.

Viral Gastroenteritis Outbreak On Board Aircraft Carrier
-------------------------------------------------------
Hundreds of sailors on board the [aircraft carrier] USS Theodore Roosevelt
[have contracted viral gastroeneteritis] during exercises in the Atlantic,
U.S. Navy officials said. When the virus [infection] peaked about 4 days
ago, it affected at least 300 of the more than 5000 crew members stationed
aboard the ship. Navy officials said they were initially puzzled as to the
cause of the widespread sickness, but the answer came after blood samples
were flown for testing at the U.S. naval base in Norfolk, Virginia. The
samples showed the crew had a [viral gastroenteritis]. At no time was the
ship quarantined, Navy officials said.
Medical teams aboard the carrier treated the cases with the usual rest and
plenty of fluids, and those not afflicted were told to wash their hands to
prevent spreading the outbreak. Officials said that the outbreak seems to
be under control and that many of the stricken sailors are back at work.
The spreading of viruses aboard ships is common because of the close
quarters the sailors keep, though it is not known why this outbreak was so
widespread, a Navy official said.

Norovirus Infection Hits 2 Long Island Hospitals
--------------------------------------------------
The virus responsible for ruining the vacations of hundreds of cruise ship
passengers in recent months is now believed to be sickening patients at 2
Long Island hospitals. Several wards at Nassau University Medical Center
(NUMC) and St. Charles Hospital have been closed off to new patients to
prevent the spread of what may be a norovirus infection. "Just like the
cruise ship where people came to the cruise ship with the virus, we believe
the same situation is occurring here," said registered nurse Maria
Ninivaggi, director of NUMC's infection control division. "It's a unit with
a confined space with a confined number of patients and it has spread among
them."
Doctors suspected something was wrong at NUMC in East Meadow on Tuesday
after noticing several patients in the 14th floor psychiatric unit vomiting
or experiencing diarrhea. Ninivaggi said 19 patients are now believed to
have the virus. Its source is unknown.
The genesis of the outbreak is similar at St. Charles Hospital in Port
Jefferson, where patients in 2 rehabilitation wards came down with a
gastrointestinal illness on Friday, and officials soon closed the wards off
to new patients. So far 21 people have fallen ill, but since those with the
virus usually recuperate within 2 to 3 days, all have recovered but one,
said Kim Kubasek, vice president of administration at St. Charles. One ward
reopened yesterday, and the other is still closed since that patient is
considered infectious. It should reopen by the weekend, Kubasek said.
Norovirus infection is no stranger to hospitals, day care centers, nursing
homes, restaurants or cruise ships. Each year, it affects 23 million
people, requiring hospitalizations for 50 000 of them, according to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although most of the time there
are no long-term health consequences, there are 310 deaths annually,
according to the CDC. Officials from both Long Island hospitals stressed
that their cases are all mild, and that the wards are being scrubbed down
and sterilized to prevent further transmission. "Obviously someone from the
community introduced it to the hospital," said Dr. Patricia Dillon, medical
director of epidemiology and disease control at the Suffolk County
Department of Health. "It could have been a disaster that spread to the
whole hospital. But their infection control measures were effective."
Dillon said no other hospitals in Suffolk reported a similar outbreak, and
this is the first outbreak this year in the county of what is believed to
be a norovirus infection. Nassau County health officials said they couldn't
comment and deferred questions to the state Department of Health, which did
not return several calls.

Norovirus Infection Widespread in Minnesota
-------------------------------------------
State health officials said an unprecedented 25 outbreaks of illness
afflicting as many as 1000 people have been attributed to norovirus
infection since 1 Nov 2002. The illness causes intense vomiting, cramps and
diarrhea usually for one or 2 days. Around the state, doctors say clinic
waiting rooms are filled with people suffering from these symptoms. The
illness has struck hundreds of students at Mounds View High School and
members of 2 professional sports teams. About half of the Minnesota Wild
developed norovirus infection symptoms last weekend, said spokesman Aaron
Sickman.
"[The infection] is everywhere," said Dr. Brad Benson, an internist and
pediatrician at the University of Minnesota Primary Care Center in
Minneapolis. Health officials said noroviruses typically make the rounds in
winter. The illness also has sickened people in Canada and other Midwestern
states and on cruise ships; a sign that the virus outbreaks are widespread.
Health officials say it's not clear why this is a bad year for these
viruses, but they added that cruise-ship outbreaks probably are the result,
not the cause, of increases in norovirus-associated illnesses everywhere.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that
noroviruses cause 23 million cases of stomach illness each year.

Norovirus Infection Has Become widespread in Alaska
---------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of gastroenteritis reported last week in Ketchikan is being
reported in other Alaska cities, including Anchorage, and health officials
think more outbreaks are possible as people spread the virus through their
holiday travels. As of Wed 18 Dec 2002, similar outbreaks infecting
hundreds of Alaskans have cropped up at a U.S. Navy camp near Ketchikan,
among members of a dance troupe in Juneau, as well as students in Craig and
children attending a day care center in Anchorage, according to the state
Section of Epidemiology. All of the outbreaks are probably caused by a
norovirus, which is thought to be the most common cause of gastrointestinal
illness in the United States, epidemiologists said.
So far, state medical authorities have confirmed only 2 cases of norovirus
infection , in samples taken from children connected to the Anchorage day
care center. Stool samples from Ketchikan and Juneau have been sent to the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, but results are not
available yet, Alaska epidemiologists said. The 2 positive cases from
Anchorage are similar to the virus strains detected on recent cruises, the
state epidemiology office said. Dr. Joe McLaughlin, who helped investigate
the cases in Ketchikan, said medical investigators working there didn't
identify anyone who had been on the ships or had known someone who had.
In Alaska's outbreaks, 2 people were hospitalized in Ketchikan, but no
deaths were reported, epidemiologists said. People do not have to be
traveling on ships to get the virus, however. Sue Anne Jenkerson, state
nurse epidemiologist, said people can get the virus through food, water and
possibly through air. It's passed person to person -- the route likely to
blame for the recent outbreaks in Alaska, she said. The current round can
be traced to back to early October, when more than 20 children and staffers
at an Anchorage day care became ill, epidemiologists said.
A public health nurse reported that more than 75 elementary students missed
school in November due to similar symptoms in Craig, a small community
northwest of Ketchikan. During the same month, the first case of
gastroenteritis was reported in the Southeast Alaska Acoustic Measurement
Facility, which is a naval camp near Ketchikan. Within days, more people
connected with the camp came down with the illness. Someone connected with
the base is also a teacher at a Ketchikan school where there was a high
absentee rate connected to related illnesses. That person may have helped
spread the virus into the school, McLaughlin said. To date, at least 225
people living near Ketchikan have come down with symptoms typical of
Norwalk-like virus. 18 dancers or chaperones with a Juneau troupe became
ill between 6 and 10 Dec 2002. They had traveled by ferry to Wrangell and
may have been exposed to the virus on board, epidemiologists said. As a
result, the state Department of Environmental Conservation got involved.
Food safety and sanitation inspectors contacted the Wrangell hotel where
the troupe stayed and the school where they performed.

New Hampshire: Norovirus Outbreak Affects Nursing Home
------------------------------------------------------
An epidemic of what is believed to be norovirus infection has caused nearly
50 residents and workers at a local nursing home to become ill. The first
symptoms were reported on 10 Dec 2002. Since then, about 48 people
associated with Integrated Health Services, Peabody Road, have reported
cases of stomach cramps, diarrhea, loose stool and vomiting. "We have had
some cases of mild gastrointestinal illness," said Jose Montero, chief of
New Hampshire's Office of Disease Control. "Preliminary reports show that
it is a norovirus infection." By last Saturday, about 10 residents and
workers each day were experiencing different symptoms at the 112-bed
nursing home. The incident was reported to state health officials last week
by the nursing home's administrator, Gary DiPietro.
The preliminary test results revealing norovirus infection are now in the
process of being confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. Noroviruses spread quickly in closed areas such as nursing
homes, according to Montero, who said the Derry nursing home is one of
"several" elderly-care facilities in the state currently experiencing this
epidemic. He would not say how many other facilities or what state
organizations are dealing with the illness, but did say the virus often
appears at this time of year. While it is still not clear what caused the
epidemic in the local nursing home, Montero said the infection was most
likely carried into the facility by a visitor who may have contaminated the
surface of food or other items. Some employees at the nursing home have
suffered symptoms of the virus, and have been asked to stay home for at
least 48 hours after their symptoms disappear, according to Montero.
The home is not taking any admissions because of the epidemic, Morris said.
All group activities at the nursing home have been suspended, meals are
being served in individual rooms, and common areas are not being used.
"Residents are being kept isolated," Montero said. As people become healthy
again, the nursing home staff will allow some residents to visit with other
residents in their rooms if both individuals are showing no symptoms. At
this point, no residents have been hospitalized because of the epidemic,
said Morris.

Hospitals in Ontario Affected by Confirmed Norovirus Infection
--------------------------------------------------
Health Minister Tony Clement is advising many Ontarians to call the
province's nursing hotline if they suspect they have [a norovirus
infection] rather than going to hospitals, which are struggling with
outbreaks of norovirus-related disease. He made the plea yesterday at a
news conference where he was marking the one-year anniversary of the
Telehealth Ontario service. "Our best advice is that if you have the
standard symptoms of norovirus infection and you are a person of average
health, then certainly, at least in the first instance, phone Telehealth
Ontario," he said. The nursing hotline offers free medical advice around
the clock and can be reached by phoning 1-866-797-0000.
There are currently 11 Ontario hospitals with confirmed cases of the virus
and 42 more with suspected cases, according to the health ministry. The
Scarborough Hospital, Grace site, has been forced to close its critical
care and palliative care units because of the virus. The Bloorview McMillan
Centre has also closed a unit. Humber River Regional and Salvation Army
Grace are the only other hospitals in the GTA with confirmed cases of
norovirus infection .
