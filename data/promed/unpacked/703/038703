Virus outbreak in southern China kills 5, prompts panic buying of antibiotics
------------
An unidentified pneumonia virus has killed 5 people and left hundreds
hospitalized in southern China, while rumors of a surging death toll
prompted frightened residents to stock up on antibiotics, officials
said Tuesday.
Health officials said the outbreak in a region of Guangdong province
near Hong Kong had been brought under control. They said Health
Ministry investigators sent from Beijing were trying to find the
source of the disease.
Some 300 people have been hospitalized, one third of them doctors,
nurses, and other health workers, said an official of the provincial
Disease Prevention and Control Center. He said 59 of those people had
been treated and released. Officials wouldn't give any details about
who was killed by the disease or when.
Rumors that hundreds of people had died prompted residents to clear
store shelves of antibiotics and pay inflated prices for white
vinegar for use as disinfectant, officials said. Photos in Hong Kong
newspapers showed people in Guangdong wearing surgical masks in hopes
of avoiding infection. Hospitals have been given extra antibiotics,
officials said.
"The disease is under control. It's not as serious as the rumor said.
The priority now is to figure out what caused it," said a doctor at
the No.1 Hospital of the Guangzhou Medical School in Guangzhou, the
provincial capital. She wouldn't give her name.
Southern China is a major source of new strains of flu and other
viruses, which often are traced to the region's large poultry
industry. An outbreak of bird flu in Hong Kong in 1997 killed 6
people and prompted health authorities to slaughter of all of the
territory's 1.4 million chickens.
The latest disease was first reported in November [2002] in 4 cities
in Guangdong including Zhongshan, about 100 kilometers (60 miles)
northwest of Hong Kong, said the provincial disease- control
official. "We did not take it seriously at the beginning," said the
official. Rumors that the disease had spread to the neighboring
island province of Hainan prompted similar panicked buying of
antibiotics there, though no cases have been confirmed there, the
government-run China News Service reported.

At least 5 killed, 305 hit by mystery disease in China
-------------------------------------------------
A mysterious lung virus has killed 5 people and stricken 305 in
southern China, officials said amid a growing health panic.
The top leader of Guangdong province, Zhang Dejiang, ordered the
provincial health department to set up an emergency experts group to
probe the causes and sources of the unknown strain of pneumonia that
first appeared some 2 months ago, Guangdong Department of Health
officials told AFP Tuesday.
The government also urged immediate measures to curb the spread and
fatalities of the disease which has been officially termed an
"atypical pneumonia."
The disease reportedly first appeared 2 months ago in Heyuan city,
150 kilometers (90 miles) northwest of Hong Kong, while mid- January
[2003] press reports from Zhongshan city in the Pearl River Delta
downplayed the health scare and urged citizens not to panic.
"This virus has been present in Guangzhou for more than a month, and
the illness of those afflicted has been effectively treated and
controlled. There is no need for the people to panic."
Doctors urged citizens to immediately seek medical help if they
develop symptoms of the airborne communicable virus that included
fever, dizziness, muscle soreness, and bouts of coughing.
Residents were also urged to fumigate their rooms with a
vinegar-based steam wash, wear gauze masks, and stay away from
crowded areas such as shopping centers and train stations.

[This sounds a lot like the outbreak in Russia in 2001, for which we
never heard the cause -- see ref. below. There is as yet no evidence
that this outbreak is caused by a virus, but if it is, antibiotics
and white vinegar will have no effect. China is good at diagnosing
influenza, so it seems that this is something different that is
highly infectious in a hospital setting. We await further
information. - Mod.JW]
