6 in hospital over suspected anthrax
------------------------------------
6 people, residents of Kinondoni and Mbezi Beach in Dar es Salaam,
were admitted to Mwananyamala Hospital in the city suffering from
anthrax. The Dar es Salaam City Doctor, Dr. Deo Mtasiwa, confirmed
the existence of the illness.
Anthrax is a serious disease that affects sheep and cows and can
occur in human beings. He traced the source of the disease to cows
belonging to a resident of Mbezi Beach, who slaughtered a cow without
consulting a health official. He said those hospitalized have shown
signs of having anthrax and had admitted having eaten the suspected
meat. Dr Mtasiwa said, however, that the owner of the cow and his
family were not infected.
Regarding patients from Kinondoni, Dr Mtasiwa said he was afraid that
they could have picked up the anthrax infection from another source,
elsewhere in the city. On steps taken after the incident, he said the
City Health Department has put the patients on medication and
vaccinated other cows belonging to the Mbezi resident. Samples of the
meat have also been sent to the Muhimbili National Hospital and the
National Veterinary Laboratory in Temeke. He warned against eating
meat products from animals slaughtered without having been approved
by health officers. Besides, he said the Mbezi resident would be
charged for slaughtering an animal and selling meat in a place not
designated for the same.

[Livestock anthrax is endemic in many countries in southern and
western Africa. Statistics for Tanzania can be found in the
following website:

No clinical information on the manifestations of the human cases is
stated above; cutaneous disease can be produced by handling the
carcass, and gastrointestinal disease can occur after ingestion of
spores. - Mod.LL]
