From: Krista Visser <visserk@hari.agvic.gov.au>

At the moment I'm working on a thesis about Borna disease virus and I came
across information on wobbly possum disease on the net
(http://www.wantree.com.au/~rabbit/wobbly.htm).
I was wondering if you could tell me if anything is publicised on this
subject and if
so, in what journals I would be able to find it. I also would like to know
what tests they are doing at the moment to determine whether the disease is
caused by the known Borna disease virus or by something else.
I hope you'll be able to answer my questions. Thanks in advance.

[Now, normally we are very reluctant to even consider doing searches for
graduate students, but this was too tempting!. However, like Krista we found
this web posting unsatisfactory. All it said was that the virus was
Borna-like, the disease carried a 95%CFR, did not occur in Oz possums, and
the Kiwi possums were disorientated when they emerged into the sunlight ...
rather like some of my colleagues. Nothing on the gross or histological brain
lesions; some assertions but nothing with hard data. Maybe our New Zealand
colleagues could bring us up to date on this fascinating condition.
