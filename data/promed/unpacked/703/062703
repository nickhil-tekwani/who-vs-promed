Comments from Professor Alvin Smith
-----------------------------------
Some comments previously posted (see above ProMED-mail archive
references) did not focus on the calicivirus issues involving USDA
regulations, agricultural production, and the emerging public health
and food safety risks communicated in the referenced paper. [See:
Public Veterinary Medicine: Regulatory Detection of vesicular
exanthema of swine-like calicivirus in tissues from a naturally
infected spontaneously aborted bovine fetus Alvin W. Smith, Douglas
E. Skilling, David O. Matson, Andrew D. Kroeker, David A. Stein,
Tamas Berke, and Patrick L. Iversen JAVMA 15 Feb 2002 - Vol 220, No.
4 - Pages 425 - 568. These are highly important issues that need to
be addressed.
The following facts and observations, drawn from peer-reviewed
publications, are to focus attention on these issues and answer
questions raised in the posted comments.
1. Ocean fish are a primary reservoir for vesiviruses and marine
mammals eating fish also become reservoirs. Vesiviruses can multiply
to tens of millions in fish spleen (Smith AW, Skilling DE, et al.
1981, Arch. Virol. 67: 165-168). One such calicivirus isolated from a
naturally infected salt-water fish caused fulminating Vesicular
Exanthema in swine and the disease rapidly spread from pig to pig
(Smith AW, Skilling DE, et al. 1980 Science 209: 92-98). These are
Foreign Animal Disease (FAD) agents that mimic Foot and Mouth
Disease, cause unacceptable production losses in livestock, and can
cause disease in humans (Smith AW, Skilling DE, et al. 2002 J. AM.
Vet. Med. Assoc. 220: 455-458).
2. One migratory marine mammal population had an 85 percent
prevalence of neutralizing antibody, some at high titer, to Feline
Calicivirus (FCV) (Smith AW, Skilling DE, et al 1998 Emerg. Inf. Dis.
4: 13-20). This finding signals a probable extensive reservoir for
FCV as well.
3. Viruses that can occasionally be demonstrated to flow from
terrestrial hosts to the ocean (comment cited influenza virus as an
example), do not to my knowledge end up replicating to high numbers
in any ocean fish species, nor do infected fish become a source of
influenza for people. Another comment properly restated should say:
Caliciviruses other than the genus Vesivirus may not come from ocean
reservoirs but vesiviruses do.
4. Oceans are massive reservoirs and incubators for new and perhaps
recurring vesivirus types [species? that can and do infect domestic
animals and humans. This finding is a paradigm shift that must not be
ignored (Smith AW, Skilling DE, et al. 1998 Emerg. Inf. Dis. 4:
13-20).
5. Caliciviruses cause a continuum of diseases often attacking vital
organs (liver, heart, brain, lung, gut, and blood). For example,
members of the genus Vesivirus have been recently implicated in both
hepatitis and hemorrhagic disease (Smith AW, Skilling DE,et al. 1998
Emerg. Inf. Dis. 4: 13-20), thus exhibiting the disease
manifestations of a closely related virus of rabbits (classified in a
different genus, the genus Lagovirus, within the family
Caliciviridae).
6. Vesicular Exanthema of Swine Virus was said to have been
eradicated from USA swine in 1956 and was declared a FAD agent on 22
Oct 1959 (Smith AW, Boyt PM. 1990 J. Zoo and Wildlf. Med. 21: 2-23).
However, the virus was re-isolated from whales in 1968; from swine in
1976, 1990 and 1991; and from cattle in 1982, 1989 and 1995. Viruses
indistinguishable from VESV in physical and genomic properties were
isolated from skunks (Seal BS, Lutze-Wallace C, et al. 1995 Vet. Res.
37: 1-12). This evidence and extensive serologic surveys demonstrated
that the virus was not eradicated (Smith AW, Boyt PM. 1990 J. Zoo and
Wildlf. Med. 21: 3-23).
7. The comment that "vesicular exanthema of swine has not recurred in
the USA (or anywhere else)" could be misleading. Accurately restated,
one could say: The disease manifestation of vesicular exanthema
caused by caliciviral infections in swine has not been officially and
publicly reported; but other disease manifestations have, and
vesicular exanthema has been reported in dolphins, various seal
species, primates, and humans (Smith AW, Skilling DE, et al. 1998
Emerg. Inf. Dis. 4: 13-20).
8. For 50 years, regulatory testing protocols for vesicular diseases
including Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) stated that Vesicular
Exanthema of Swine Virus would not infect cattle, but in 1982 cattle
became a newly recognized host of this FAD agent (Smith AW, Mattson
DE, et al. 1983 Am. J. Vet. Res. 44: 851-858). The need to accurately
and rapidly distinguish FMD virus from the Vesiviruses has not only
become much more complex, it is now more important. That is because
vesiviruses are zoonotic, their ocean reservoirs insure a continuing
source for new virus types coming ashore, and US cattle and swine
herds are endemically infected (Smith AW, Skilling DE, et al. 2002 J.
Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 220: 455-458).
9. Food safety experiments, modeling the possibility of transmitting
the virus between mammalian species, were carried out. The protocol
included identifying a naturally infected mammal of one species and
grinding the carcass meat into hamburger, which was stored frozen for
a year. The meat was then fed to 2 additional species. Both became
infected (Wilder FW, Dardiri AH. 1978 Can. J. Comp. Med. 42:200-204).
10. Two serologically distinct vesiviruses were isolated from
infected humans with blistering disease (Smith AW. Skilling DE, et
al. 1998 Clin. Inf. Dis. 26: 43-48). Based on this proof of human
susceptibility and the feeding experiments, infected fish and meat
from livestock with endemic infections become an obvious food safety
risk.
11. Emerging Infectious Diseases 2002 8: 145-153, Hajjeh RT, Relman
D, et al. reports on the possible causes of unexplained deaths and
critical illnesses due to infectious agents. Of the 122 cases that
met the study criteria, only 34 percent could be attributed to
specific infectious agents. All of these were previously recognized
bacterial or viral pathogens. Perhaps the remaining 72 percent
without an etiologic diagnosis could be attributable to emerging
agents including the zoonotic caliciviruses. Those seeking the
infectious cause of disease may not have considered these because
test reagents were not generally available. The Health Care Delivery
Community is unaware of the human health risk from zoonotic
caliciviruses.
12. The literature citations given above and others cited in the
bovine abortion paper will provide a rich introduction into the
background of emerging zoonotic caliciviral diseases. Aggressive
reporting of new knowledge and identifying biomedical implications
for the public at large are worthy and necessary endeavors. Such
endeavors are well suited to the contributions that ProMED-mail can
make.

[The previous ProMED-mail reports were based on a press report of
statements attributed to Professor Smith. ProMED-mail welcomes this
clarification and detailed statement from Professor Smith. I do not
believe that any of my comments are in conflict with the evidence
cited by Professor Smith. In particular, I believe that it is correct
to state that the disease named "Vesicular Exanthema of Swine" has
not recurred (in swine); this does not imply that the agent
responsible may not still be prevalent in reservoir species. The
designation "Foreign Animal Disease" for any condition ascribed to a
virus resident in oceanic fish (and according to Professor Smith
present now in skunks) still seems anomalous to me. - Mod.CP
