Residents of Ibanda and Isingiro are on high alert after 3 cases of Rift Valley fever were reported in the 2 districts. The cases were discovered by doctors at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) after one patient from Isingiro died at the facility and 2 others presented symptoms of the viral disease that affects animals as well as humans who meat from the dead animals.

"In the past 2 weeks, we have received 3 patients from Ibanda and Isingiro. Initially they were presenting normal medical conditions of fever and headache but when they started bleeding we had to investigate further and that's when we confirmed it was Rift Valley fever," Dr Rose Muhindo, the head of medical ward at MRRH, told journalists on [Mon 16 Jul 2018]. Dr Muhindo said one patient is from Nakivale Refugee Settlement in Isingiro and another is from Ibanda and that they are responding to treatment.

The executive director MRRH, Dr Celestine Barigye, said: "I challenge the public to stop eating meat from dead animals, let them be buried because sickness from these animals are so serious and kill human beings too."

In January [2018], the Ministry of Health confirmed sporadic outbreaks of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Kiboga, Buikwe and Mityana districts. [The minister] Dr [Jane] Aceng said a team of experts had been dispatched to tackle the outbreaks, and spraying of ticks and biting insects, some of the key transmitters of the fevers, had started in the cattle corridor of Nakaseke, Sembabule, Kyegegwa, Lyantonde, Mubende, and Gomba districts.

Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a viral zoonosis that primarily affects animals but also has the capacity to infect humans. Infection can cause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease also results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock. Outbreaks of RVF in animals can be prevented by a sustained programme of animal vaccination.

[Of the 3 above cases, 2 may have been included in the ProMED-mail post of a [Fri 6 Jul 2018] WHO report (see: Rift Valley fever - Eastern Africa (13): Uganda, WHO 20180711.5898523). Although people can become infected through contact with sick animals or their tissues and secretions, Rift Valley fever virus can also be transmitted by mosquitoes. As noted in the previous post, a [Sun 24 Jun 2018] report from a meeting of 11th meeting of the Sectoral Council on Agriculture and Food Security (SCAFS) that just concluded in Dar es Salaam, has directed the East African Community (EAC) secretariat to address the issue of Rift Valley fever promptly. It stated that this year's [2018] heavy rainfall has resulted in widespread flooding in low-lying grasslands. Flooding and standing water enabled a higher number of mosquito eggs than usual to hatch and thus increased the potential for RVF to spread among people and animals.

The RVF virus is endemic in the EAC region and has caused repeated outbreaks in the past. It affects primarily ruminant livestock, such as cattle, sheep, goats, and camels and also wildlife such as buffalos. In these animals, it causes abortions and deaths and significant economic loss.

The RVF virus can also affect humans. Most infections are mild, but some people fall severely ill and even die, with symptoms such as fever, weakness, and bleeding from gums and mouth. The majority of human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. This can happen during slaughtering or butchering, while assisting with animal births, treating the animals, and from contact with disposed carcasses or fetuses. - Mod.TY
