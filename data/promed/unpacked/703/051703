The representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Guinea Dr Georges Alfred Ki-Zerbogives has given an update on the preparation of the response to deal with the new Ebola epidemic declared mid-February 2021 in Guinea.

Five people have died of Ebola virus in Guinea, the health agency said on Mon 15 Feb 2021 as the government and aid groups began to roll out their response to the outbreak.

Dr Georges Alfred Ki-Zerbo says "the reasons for optimism are the lessons learned and the technological and scientific advances that have been seen between 2016 and now, in particular vaccines, rapid detection tests that are easier to use in the field, therapeutic methods as well, means of protection such as centres that make it possible to treat patients without direct exposure of caregivers or with better protection of families, as well as the lessons learned in community involvement. So by taking up all these achievements, we can be optimistic that we will not have a disaster on the scale of what happened last time." Dr. Alfred Ki-Zerbo adds.

Guinea announced the outbreak on Sat [13 Feb 2021], the 1st in West Africa since a 2013-2016 epidemic that left more than 11 300 dead in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

According to an epidemiological report by the country's health agency dated 15 Feb 2021, 5 people have now succumbed to the virus, rising from a death toll of 4 reported earlier on Mon [15 Feb 2021].

Only one of the victims was confirmed positive for Ebola, with the remaining 4 listed as "probable cases".

Two other people have tested positive, the health agency said, while another 10 are showing symptoms.

The 1st confirmed victim was a 51-year-old nurse, who died in late January 2021.

She was from Nzerekore near the town of Gouecke in the forested south of the country.

Two of the nurse's brothers who attended her funeral on 1 Feb 2021 have also died, a health official who requested anonymity said.

It remains unclear who the other victims are, or whether they attended the nurse's funeral.

The UN's Guinea office tweeted that the 1st flight carrying experts and sanitary equipment arrived in Nzerekore on Mon 15 Feb 2021.

Prime Minister Ibrahima Kassory Fofana said Guinea had "set up structures to deal with this type of epidemic".

"No panic, let's respect the sanitary instructions. Ebola will be defeated again," he tweeted.

Ebola causes severe fever and, in the worst cases, unstoppable bleeding. It is transmitted through close contact with bodily fluids, and people who live with or care for patients are most at risk.

An NGO official who spoke to AFP on condition of anonymity said he was concerned because health workers had not yet identified who infected the nurse.

But Alfred George Ki-Zerbo, the World Health Organization's representative in Guinea, said that Ebola vaccines could arrive in the poor nation of 13 million "within 72 hours".

"Our priority is to complete the risk assessment on the ground and to analyse the cross-border dimension," he said, referring to the area near the Liberian border where the virus re-emerged.

Guinea's health agency is also increasing its capacity in the area.

Anja Wolz, the Ebola coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, said the NGO was sending an experienced medical team to meet local people and explain the need to follow health rules.

"We know that when such a frightening disease is misunderstood in the community, and individuals suddenly arrive giving instructions, in costumes resembling spacesuits, it can easily generate a hostile reaction," she said.

It is important to recognize that "resources are thin in Guinea, one of the world's poorest countries, which was already battling the coronavirus pandemic on top of outbreaks of yellow fever and measles.

"We are facing 4 epidemics at the same time," Keita said.

"The nation of 13 million has recorded 14 895 coronavirus infections and 84 deaths."

(from https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/guinea-declares-ebola-epidemic-after-seven-cases-and-4-deaths/).

The country has a real challenge to face with Ebola now added to COVID, yellow fever, and measles on top of TB, malaria, and HIV/AIDS, not to mention ongoing violence in the region and poverty. No country should have to deal with all these issues at the same time. - Mod.LK]

[@DrMikeRyan: "We are moving vaccines in country from both Geneva and US stockpiles." Therapeutics will also be shipped: mAB114 and Regeneron antibody cocktail.

#Ebola outbreaks are also mentioned by @DrTedros: "The outbreaks in Guinea and DRC are completely unrelated. But we face similar challenges in both, incl. that they are in hard to reach, insecure areas with some mistrust of outsiders."

"The virus responsible for the new #Ebola in Guinea is Ebola Zaire, @drmichelyao1 reveals during today's @WHO presser. This is good news. The only available Ebola vaccine protects against Zaire ebolavirus. Were it one of the other Ebola strains, the Merck vaccine would not work.

Should have said "the only available #Ebola vaccines, plural. In addition to Merck's, which is currently being used in DRC, J&J has a 2-dose Ebola vax that has been approved for use by the EU. It too protects against Ebola Zaire. There are no vaccines for other Ebola strains.

@FMLarousse reports the #Ebola cases in DRC stem from viral persistence, ie. this is not a new spillover from nature. The sequence is like the viruses that circulated in 2018-2020. This means virus from a survivor ignited this spread."

The World Health Organization has asked 6 African countries to be alert for possible Ebola infections, as Guinea on Tue [16 Feb 2021] reported new cases, and Democratic Republic of Congo said its new infections were a resurgence of a previous outbreak.

Guinea declared an outbreak of the virus on Sun [14 Feb 2021] in the 1st return of the disease there since the 2013-2016 outbreak, while Congo has confirmed 4 new cases this month [February 2021].

Health authorities have rushed to respond to the cases in Guinea, anxious to prevent a repeat of the last outbreak in West Africa, which killed more than 11 300 people, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in the worst Ebola epidemic on record.

"We have already alerted the 6 countries around, including of course Sierra Leone and Liberia, and they are moving very fast to prepare and be ready and to look for any potential infection," the WHO's Margaret Harris told a Geneva briefing.

Guinea's neighbours include Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Guinea has so far recorded up to 10 suspected cases of Ebola and 5 deaths. Since declaring the outbreak, it has identified 115 contacts of the known cases in the southeastern city of Nzerekore and 10 in the capital Conakry, the health ministry said.

Gene sequencing of Ebola samples from both Congo and Guinea is being carried out to learn more about the origins of the outbreaks and identify the strains, according to the WHO.

As a result, Congo has confirmed that its latest cases are not linked to a new Ebola variant but represent a resurgence of its 10th outbreak, the 2nd-largest on record that caused more than 2200 deaths in 2018-2020.

"As for the infection, we're not yet able to identify its origin," said provincial health minister Eugene Nzanzu Salita, referring to how the 1st person to fall sick in this resurgence caught the virus.

Since the devastating epidemic in West Africa, the development of vaccines and treatments has greatly improved survival rates and containment efforts.

Further spread of the disease could cripple the regions' under-funded health systems which are also battling the coronavirus pandemic. Ivory Coast, Mali and Sierra Leone have launched plans to stop any potential spread and reinforced border controls.

The Ebola virus can cause severe bleeding and organ failure and is spread through contact with body fluids. It has a much higher death rate than COVID-19, but unlike the coronavirus, it is not transmitted by asymptomatic carriers.

[We now know from the sequencing results that the 11th outbreak of Ebola in the DRC appears to be the same strain of virus as the 10th, ie., the strain is genetically similar to the ones that circulated 2018-2020. But we still do not know whether the virus persisted in the husband of the index case and possibly in others in the population or whether it simply persisted in the environment and spilled over from the animal population to the female farmer. The latter seems less likely as one would have expected new mutations to have occurred as the virus amplified in its natural hosts.

The statement that "unlike coronavirus, [Ebola virus] is not transmitted by asymptomatic carriers" is not strictly true since in the current case in the DRC, persistent virus most likely was transmitted via the semen of the husband to his wife. Virus can persist in sequestered immunologically protected locations, with no evidence of symptoms. This has happened a number of times with Ebola survivors. The difference is that with SARS-CoV-2, an individual in the acute stage of the disease can be asymptomatic, while with Ebola, the individual apparently is recovered from the infection but still harbors infectious virus. - Mod.LK]

Guinea is tracking down people who potentially had contact with Ebola patients and will rush vaccines to the affected area as soon as possible following at least 3 deaths from the disease, Health Minister Remy Lamah said.

Lamah said that unlike during the deadliest known outbreak, which tore through West Africa in 2013-2016, Guinea had the means to halt the resurgence of the virus.

The Ebola virus causes severe bleeding and organ failure and is spread through contact with body fluids.

"In 2013, it took us months to understand that we were dealing with an Ebola epidemic, while this time, in less than 4 days, we were able to do analysis and have the results. Our medical teams are trained and seasoned. We have the means to quickly overcome this disease," Lamah told Reuters.

The World Health Organization (WHO) warned the outbreaks in Guinea and Congo represented a regional risk. The WHO representative in Guinea, Georges Ki-Zerbo, said he has requested authorisation to obtain as many vaccines doses as possible. He added that there were some constraints in getting the vaccines to Guinea quickly, but authorities were working on the issues so that the vaccines could be available by next week for a targeted vaccination campaign.

International organisations including the International Committee of the Red Cross, Medecins Sans Frontieres and medical charity ALIMA said they were sending rapid response teams to the region to assist.

The 2013-2016 outbreak killed 11 300 people, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. The 2nd deadliest known outbreak was declared over last year [2020] in Democratic Republic of Congo, but it also saw a resurgence this month [February 2021].

An Ebola vaccination campaign started in eastern Congo on Mon 15 Feb 2021.

"There is hope that with new tools and the experience and lessons learned, this could maybe work better this time," said Ki-Zerbo, underlining the need to involve local communities and listen to them.

Neighbouring Sierra Leone has sent workers to watch border entry points in coordination with Guinea authorities, a health ministry spokesman said.

"What worries us the most is the dangerousness of the disease given what we experienced 5 years ago. We do not want to relive such a situation," Lamah said.

[The response has been rapid and efficient, and significantly improved over early outbreaks, as so much has been learned from the past. But it could be made even faster by having available in country vaccine stock as well as rapid tests for patients presenting with Ebola-like symptoms. That being said, the vaccination campaign appears to have begun Mon 15 Feb 2021 after declaration Sat 13 Feb 2021 of the outbreak. Hard to beat that! - Mod.LK]

After 3 Ebola cases were confirmed in Guinea, local health authorities declared an outbreak in the rural area of Goueke in N'Zerekore on 14 Jan 2021.

In response to the newly reported cases, Doctors Without Borders (MSF, for its French acronym) announced it is putting together a mission to address the outbreak in Guinea.

"We know from past experience that the speed of the response is important, both in order to contain transmission and to provide treatment for people who have caught the disease," said Frederik van der Schrieck, MSF's head of mission in Guinea. "We also know that community engagement is vital.

We will try to get the right balance between responding quickly and taking steps to make sure the community is a willing and active participant in both prevention and response," Van der Schrieck added. "Alongside treatment for Ebola, contact tracing and other community-based activities will be absolutely vital."

This marks the 1st time Ebola has been reported in the country since the devastating 2014 outbreak in West Africa.

- Guinea: Outbreak containment

At least 4 [now 5] people have died in the epidemic, causing heightened alarm across west Africa

"All measures are being taken to stem this epidemic as soon as possible," Guinea's health ministry said, declaring an outbreak of the virus last seen in the region in 2016, at the end of a traumatic 3-year outbreak, which infected more than 28 000 people and caused 11 000 deaths in west Africa.

The epidemic spread from Guinea to Liberia, Sierra Leone and other countries in the region, sparking extensive and vital prevention, treatment and surveillance systems in several countries, which health officials said had been immediately alerted to contain the outbreak in Guinea. An intensive test-and-trace campaign has begun in Goueke and neighbouring towns.

Vaccinations and treatments that have been developed in recent years were being quickly deployed to Guinea and were on standby in neighbouring Liberia and other west African countries, the World Health Organization said, adding to hope that an outbreak could be contained.

"There is real concern and a challenge to maintain and reinforce Guinea's health systems," said Georges Ki-Zerbo, the head of the WHO mission in Guinea, "but also there is a lot of reinforcement taking place and regional cooperation. On the ground, there are dozens of respondents already mobilised."

The spectre of an Ebola outbreak emerging as countries battled with Covid-19 was also an acute concern, Ki-Zerbo said, as resources were stretched. In some places the response to the pandemic was also a strength. "The alert and vigilance brought by Covid should also help with Ebola, which is easier to detect," he said.

Yet an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), while the country battles to contain coronavirus cases as conflict intensifies, has caused alarm. Four cases of Ebola have been detected, with efforts to address the outbreak hamstrung by conflict between armed groups. Kate Moger, a regional official at the International Rescue Committee, said the Ebola cases were a disaster for communities in northern DRC. "They have faced decades of violence by armed groups and have now, between Ebola and Covid-19, been faced with disease outbreaks for almost 3 straight years."

Following the cases in Guinea, health officials in west Africa expressed a mixture of growing concern but also some confidence that a major outbreak could be averted. Significant progress had been achieved in improving the capabilities of health systems in small, low income countries like Guinea in west Africa to deal with virus outbreaks such as Ebola, Lassa fever, yellow fever and most recently Covid-19, Ki-Zerbo said.

Liberia, which shares a porous border with Guinea, announced its health systems would be on alert for potential cases. Heounohu Romello Hessou, a doctor and senior official in the country's Covid-19 response, worked in Liberia during its Ebola outbreak and said measures had rapidly begun since the 1st cases were announced in Guinea and an intensive test-and-trace system was underway in nearby Liberian border towns.

"Right now, the entire public health institute, essentially birthed from the Ebola outbreak, are working around the clock, sending fact-finding teams, putting out public health measures in those towns bordering Guinea," he said.

"Ring vaccinations" were being implemented, where vaccines to prevent and treat Ebola would be administered to all known contacts of those infected, he said, with the capacity for widespread testing available.

[2] DRC and Guinea: International Rescue Committee: call for funding

[original: https://www.rescue.org/press-release/new-ebola-outbreaks-emerge-drc-and-guinea-irc-calls-swift-action-and-funding-frontline]


As a 4th case of Ebola is confirmed in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is extremely concerned that another Ebola outbreak in the area will devastate a community still reeling from the last outbreak, fighting COVID-19 and seeing increasing violence and food insecurity. The last outbreak in this area was declared over less than a year ago and took the lives of more than 2200 people, almost 66% of those who presented with the virus. The response was extremely challenging due to ongoing conflict in the area, and the outbreak lasted more than 2 years. Beating Ebola in North Kivu now will be doubly complicated given the impacts of COVID-19. As another Ebola outbreak is also declared in Guinea, where the 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak began, the IRC is calling for swift action and direct funding to frontline aid agencies to put an end to both outbreaks.

Kate Moger, Regional Vice President for the Great Lakes at the IRC, said, "Another outbreak in North Kivu is a disaster. We cannot stress enough how difficult this will be for the people living in the province. They have faced decades of violence by armed groups and have now, between Ebola and COVID-19, been faced with disease outbreaks for almost 3 straight years. These communities are still trying to rebuild from the impact the last Ebola outbreak had on their health systems, as well as the emotional trauma from an increase in violence, particularly against women, all whilst fighting COVID-19. The COVID pandemic has further exacerbated an already dire situation and led to a major increase in food insecurity and even more conflict. Another Ebola outbreak on top of this is catastrophic.

It is imperative we apply the lessons learned from past outbreaks to stop the spread of Ebola in both the DRC and Guinea. The IRC stands in solidarity with the affected communities and is calling for immediate action and funding for frontline aid agencies to contain both outbreaks and prevent further spread."

There are now more people facing a severe hunger crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo than has ever been recorded in any country. DRC ranks in the IRC's emergency Watchlist top 5 for the 3rd year in a row, reflecting persistent volatility in a country that is now in its 4th decade of a major humanitarian crisis.

The IRC responded to the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in North Kivu working in more than 70 health facilities throughout Beni, Mabalako, Butembo and Goma on infection prevention and control (IPC). The IRC is also working on women's and children's protection and integrating Ebola-related protection concerns in areas where the IRC supports primary health care services. The IRC worked to contain the 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The IRC has been working in the DRC since 1996 providing emergency assistance and humanitarian aid to those affected by violence and uprooted from their homes. As the country struggles to recover from decades of conflict and widespread disease, the IRC is focusing our efforts in Tanganyika, Kasai Central, and North and South Kivu by providing emergency health care, shelter, water, sanitation, and emergency supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in eastern and central Congo.

[3] North Kivu: Ituri strain of Ebola Zaire from 10th outbreak
Date: Mon 15 Feb 2021

https://7sur7.cd/2021/02/15/nord-kivuebola-il-sagit-de-la-suite-de-la-10e-souche-min-prov-de-la-sante


The provincial minister of health in North Kivu, doctor Nzanzu Syalita Eugene, held a press briefing on Mon 15 Feb 2021 at the office of the Provincial Division of Health (DPS) branch of Butembo, in which he gave more details on the Ebola virus which resurfaced in the health zones of Biena (Lubero) and Katwa. According to the latter, it is a continuation of the strain of the 10th epidemic. It is therefore not a 2nd episode. So far, the cumulative number of positive cases is 4 including 2 deaths.

"We got the results today [15 Feb 2021]. At least in advance, what we can communicate is that the virus that is circulating now or that was identified in the 1st case is a virus that has circulated in the region. This is the variant called Ituri. So the variant that was in Biakato and Mabalako, "explained Dr. Nzanzu Syalita Eugene.

He also says that vaccination has already started in the health zone of Biena (Lubero) where the very 1st case was declared on 6 Feb 2021. For the moment, more than 300 cases are listed. The vaccination phase will extend to the Katwa health zone, in the town of Butembo.

This 10th epidemic was declared for the 1st time in the DRC in August 2018. The response against Ebola had lasted about 2 years. It was in June 2020 that the 10th epidemic was proclaimed over in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri. The 11th episode followed in the province of Equateur. The 10th strain of Ebola reappeared in February 2021.
