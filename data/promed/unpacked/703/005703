There has been a question as to why this outbreak is being called "West
Nile-LIKE virus" rather than simply "West Nile virus."
In a long and interesting NYTimes Online article (URL above) is the
following short paragraph:
"Federal health officials said that the virus is essentially identical to
West Nile, but they will not officially call it West Nile until genetic
decoding is completed."

[Seems to me that until it is definitively identified, it should be called
WN-like. Could be Kunjin-like also, depending on the results, which I
haven't seen. More likely WN, of course, but could be Kunjin.
CDC is using PCR to detect WNV in mosquito pools and vertebrate tissues. No
question that is a legitimate application of PCR. But it will only allow
them to say that it is 90% or 95% or 98% similar to the reference WN strain.
When they are all through they will still have to do a standard serologic
test or use a monoclonal [highly specific antibody, otherwise all they will
be able to say is "WN-like". Until someone identifies (not simply detects)
the virus it can only legitimately be called WN-like (which really is
Kunjin-like and SLE-like and a lotta other-likes). - Mod.CHC -- who has left
