Prairie dogs quite readily learn to take handouts from people at picnic
areas and other locations where most humans they encounter are friendly and
come bearing food. If the 7-year-old child happened to be at such a
location, I think all we have is an accidental nip.
Yes, feeding wildlife is a bad idea. But kids will be kids -- we have an
eight-year-old, who has been caught feeding just about everything, despite
warnings not to, because he never met a critter he didn't like, and has met
very few who didn't quickly warm up to him. And he has been nipped a few
times, as well, but never in any way other than an accidental nip. Critters
with eyes on the sides of their heads instead of bifocal vision, in
particular, don't always distinguish well between where a treat ends and
little fingers begin.

My electronic response to Dr. Martinelli's questions has been delayed due
to my e-mail server at work being out of order. I visited with Dr.
Martinelli when I received a fax of the ProMED-mail posting on the
afternoon of 12/28. This incident actually occurred south of the Texas
Panhandle in Scurry County. There are three points in Dr. Martinelli's post
that should be addressed.
The first is the question of the risk this incident poses for transmitting
rabies. Small mammals such as prairie dogs are not considered to be at a
high risk of transmitting rabies in Texas based on the results for
laboratory submissions of these species since 1985. Only six prairie dogs
have been submitted for rabies testing in Texas with 5 testing negative and
1 reported as "destroyed". None were from Scurry County. Since 1985 there
have also been 3 negative ground hogs, 7 negative chipmunks, 14 negative
weasels, 138 gophers (130 negative, none positive) and 16 nutria (14
negative, none positive) received by the four Texas rabies laboratories.
One reason these small mammals are a low risk for rabies transmission may
be a function of their size. A rabid animal is likely to inflict a fatal
wound on these creatures, thus removing them from the possibility of
becoming a rabies vector; or upon becoming symptomatic with rabies, they
become less able to escape from predator species. Since it is possible for
transmission to occur, each case must be evaluated based on lab results and
epidemiology in the event a negative test is not obtained.
Although Dr. Martinelli is in Lubbock, Texas, the incident was in a county
located just north of the Texas gray fox rabies epidemic [area. No
isolations of this particular rabies strain have been made from this
county. Since 1985 there have been 316 specimens submitted for rabies
testing from Scurry County. Only 8 (2.5%) were positive. The last 3
positive animals were in 1990, 1993 and January 1998. Two were skunks and
the third was a red fox with a skunk strain of rabies virus. Based on this
incident involving a prairie dog and the incidence of rabies in Scurry
County, I informed Dr. Martinelli that rabies was a very low risk
consideration in this incident.
A second point to consider is the possibility of plague or tularemia.
Either of these diseases do not pose a high risk with regard to
transmission through biting, unless the animal had pharyngitis or pneumonia
due to plague; was excreting blood from the oral or nasal cavities; or the
child was bitten by an arthropod or insect vector of either of these
diseases. Dr. Hodges, the Texas Dept. of Health's Zoonosis Control
Veterinarian for the Region encompassing Scurry Co. contacted the Snyder
Animal Control personnel this morning to obtain an assessment of the
viability of the colony. Except for a single sick prairie dog, the colony
appears to be prospering so plague is a remote possibility. The sick animal
was captured and has been submitted for rabies and plague testing. Unless a
positive test result is obtained for either disease, prophylactic treatment
will not be a recommendation. Dr. Martinelli has been informed of the
colony's status and will be notified of the laboratory results as soon as
they are available.
The third point is that this exercise underscores the importance of the
health department, be it city, county, regional or state, in assessing the
risks posed by human encounters with animals capable of being reservoirs
for zoonoses. As members of the health care community, public health
officials are happy to provide the type of risk assessment consultation
sought by Dr. Martinelli.
Please address any personal communications to my work e-mail address which
should be functional next week.
