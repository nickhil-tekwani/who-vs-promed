Re: Avian influenza (H9), poultry, Colombia sensitivity
-------------------------------------------------------
I would like to address the comment made below by the
moderator that H9 has "not been shown to affect people."
2 cases of human H9N2 infection were reported in Hong Kong
in March 1999. Infection was identified on nasopharyngeal
aspirates from 2 children; H9N2 virus was confirmed by the
WHO influenza reference laboratories in both London, UK and
Atlanta GA, USA. The illness in both children was mild
[fever, URI] and self-limited. A history of probable contact
with poultry was reported for one of the children.
In 1999, detection of antibody to H9N2 among persons in
northern and southern China and poultry workers in Hong Kong
suggests additional unrecognized infection. To date, there
was no evidence of human-to-human transmission of H9N2
virus.

[Dr DuVernoy is correct in that H9 has infected humans, and
I did not have these references on my list, but I do now.
Thanks to Dr DuVernoy for the references and the correction.

It is perhaps worth adding that Seo and Webster (J Virol
2001; 75: 2516-25), as part of a study of avian influenza
viruses isolated in Hong Kong markets, were able to show
that cross-reactive cellular immunity induced by H9N2
influenza virus infection protected chickens from lethal
infection with H5N1 influenza viruses but did not abort
virus shedding in the feces. They concluded that
cross-reactive cellular immunity can change the outcome of
avian influenza virus infection in birds housed in live
markets and create a situation for the perpetuation of H5N1
influenza viruses. Subsequently, Xu et al (J Virol 2003; 77:
6988-94), in a study of influenza viruses recovered from
ducks in southern China, found that some H9N2 viruses were
double or triple reassortants that had amino acid signatures
in their hemagglutinin, indicating a potential to directly
infect humans. Some of these H9N2 reassortants contained
genome segments related to those of H5N1 and H5N2 avian
viruses. They concluded that the 2-way transmission of
influenza viruses between terrestrial and aquatic birds had
generated novel reassortant H9N2 influenza viruses that
might directly or indirectly play a role in the emergence of
the next pandemic influenza virus. - Mod.CP]
