Emergency Management Warning 4: Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease
(Viral Hemorrhagic Disease of Rabbits) FINAL Update
----------------------------------------------
Background Information:
On 17 Aug 2001, USDA's Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic
Laboratory (FADDL) confirmed rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD),
also known as rabbit calicivirus disease, based on hemagglutination
tests and electron microscopy, in a rabbitry in Utah County, Utah.
Utah update:
Both premises have been depopulated, cleaned, and disinfected.
Montana Update:
As a result of possible exposure at the Yellowstone County Fair, the
State Veterinarian placed 15 premises under quarantine. Since this time
the quarantines have been lifted.
Idaho Update:
The 3600 rabbits traveling through Idaho on a truck and considered to
be contacts of the Montana premises were euthanized and disposed of
appropriately.
Illinois Update:
The Mercer County premises, which received 72 rabbits from the
infected Utah premises, was depopulated, cleaned, and disinfected.
***
APHIS, Veterinary Services (VS) considers this current outbreak to be
over. Rabbits on infected and direct-contact premises have been
depopulated and the premises have been cleaned and disinfected. There
have been no further suspect cases. VS will continue to investigate
reports of suspect RHD as part of their foreign animal disease
surveillance program.
From all of the epidemiological data gathered so far, the outbreak has
been contained to the premises mentioned above. Tracing in all
affected States has revealed no other rabbit movements from these
premises before quarantines were in place. No trace in source of the
virus has been identified. [Presumably this means that the origin is still
unknown. - Mod.MHJ
As a result of this second outbreak, VS will continue the process of
collecting information on the rabbit industries in efforts to minimize the
impact of this disease on the industry. Industry input will be necessary
and important if the outcome is to accommodate the broad range of
issues of the rabbit industry.
