The government of Entre Rios declared a phytosanitary emergency due to Huanglongbing (HLB) and urged producers and authorities to adopt and / or strengthen control, prevention, and surveillance tasks throughout the provincial territory. Authorities detected the presence of the HLB vector insect, _Diaphorina citri_, in commercial fields and in urban areas. HLB could affect 36 000 hectares [88 958 acres] devoted to [citrus] production in the province.

The statement added that "the risk of introduction of the disease is increased by the growing transit of plant material and people, and the non-existence of effective methods to control the disease once it has established in an area." The Production Secretariat said they would relaunch "a training program with breeders and strategies for the open-air nurseries that are prohibited by national legislation."

[Greening is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops affecting leaves and fruit. It is caused by fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacteria classified as _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas; Asian greening; huanglongbing, HLB), africanus (including a subsp. capensis; African greening) or americanus (CaLam; South American greening). The 3 pathogens can only be distinguished by molecular methods.

Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves, as well as small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit. The diseases are restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of their psyllid vectors. The pathogens can also be spread by grafting and possibly by seed from infected plants or transovarially in the vectors. Both pathogens and vectors can be spread with plant material.

Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards and non-crop reservoirs. Control using cultural methods, such as interplanting with non-host crops, is being trialled. In areas where a pathogen has not yet been detected, biological control of vectors has been used successfully to reduce insect numbers and, therefore, the risk of greening outbreaks (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20090601.2034).

Several phytoplasma species have been reported to cause similar symptoms in citrus and coinfections of phytoplasmas with CaLas have also been reported (for example, see ProMED-mail post 20180214.5629251). Further research is needed on symptomatology, epidemiology and host impact of both single and mixed infections of these pathogens.

In Argentina, CaLas was first reported in 2012 (ProMED-mail post 20120917.129665) from the border with Brazil in Misiones province. In Brazil, both CaLas and CaLam are known to occur, with CaLas having outcompeted CaLam over time and millions of HLB affected trees having been eradicated (see ProMED-mail post 20121114.1408468).
