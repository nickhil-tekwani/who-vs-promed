A total of 56 cases of rabies were reported this year [2009], the
vast majority in the north of the country. In each of the past 3
years, there were 9 to 12 cases of the disease. "It's a real plague,"
said Safed municipal veterinarian Dr. Roi Davidson. "Rabies has never
been found in Safed, and this year we had 5 cases."

It's not just the increase in the number of reported rabies cases
that has human and animal health officials concerned. This year
[2009], in what is seen as a worrying trend, most cases were
discovered in dogs, many of them house pets. "This year's rabies has
gone from being a disease of wild animals to being an urban disease,"
Davidson said. "This is an extreme and discouraging development; it
means rabies in dogs that people raise and love."

Unless caught and treated before the appearance of symptoms, death is
inevitable after infection with the rabies virus. All mammals are
susceptible to rabies. Contagion is via saliva, usually through
bites. The disease can be prevented in animals by immunization.
Humans who are exposed to the virus can avoid contracting rabies if
they are treated with the vaccine before symptoms appear. In 1997, 3
people in Israel died of rabies, the last time the disease was fatal
to humans in the country.

Davidson attributes the resurgence of rabies among dogs kept as pets
to "negligible" awareness of the disease. "Since realizing that the
disease has reached us, 300 dog owners suddenly came to vaccinate"
dogs that had not been immunized previously. "People don't understand
that you can die from rabies; they don't understand the duty of
vaccination, the danger, the damage," he said.

In recent months, several communities in the north have been declared
infected with rabies, and all non-vaccinated pets confiscated and put
to sleep. "It's very painful," veterinarian Dr. Yifat Shemesh of
Kibbutz Mizra said. "The animals pay the price for their owners'
negligence. Cats need to be vaccinated too, but because it's not
legally mandatory, people don't take it seriously."

A joint Agriculture Ministry and Nature and Parks Authority oral
vaccination program for foxes and jackals has nearly wiped out rabies
in these populations.

Rabies vaccinations were given to 70 donkeys rescued from abusive
situations that have been re-housed by inspectors from the ministries
of agriculture and of environmental protection on Kibbutz Geva in the
Jezreel Valley. The animals have found meaningful employment, eating
grasses alongside the kibbutz fish ponds and eliminating the need to
spray toxic herbicides.

[The number of animal rabies cases, during 2009, is almost as high as
the 2003 figures, when implementation of the fox-targeted oral
vaccination programme (ORV), earlier implemented on limited and
steadily growing scale, was extended to cover most parts of Israel.
There is, though, significant difference between 2003 and 2009: while
in 2003 (as earlier), the disease was present in vast parts of the
country (map at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2003.html>), involving
mainly foxes (45, compared to 15 dogs and not a single jackal), the
2009 outbreak is practically restricted to the Syrian and Jordanian
border areas in the north-east (map at
<http://agri3.huji.ac.il/~yakobson/rabheb/mapa2009.html>), involving
mainly canids (30 dogs, 10 jackals). This is not surprising, in view
of the fact that in Israel's neighbours, as in other parts of the
Middle East, rabies seems to be, and to have been in the past, mainly
dog-mediated. This is reflected in Syria's reporting of 11 human
rabies cases during 2008.

During 2004-2007, the biological and molecular characterization of
the rabies isolates showed that stray dogs emerged as the main animal
reservoir in Northern Israel. The virus isolates from foxes and dogs
differed in their molecular characterization, suggesting 2 distinct
separate lineages (see ref. 3).The transition from fox-mediated
rabies to dog-mediated rabies is of great concern to public health
because of the close contact between dogs and the human population.
It seems also (as expressed in item 1 above) that the initial success
of the ORV led to complacency regarding vaccination of kept dogs and
the control of the stray dog population.

Implementing ORV in a single country within a rabies-stricken region
lacking efficient control systems is liable to difficulties. This was
predicted by experts during the 1990's, indicating the vital need for
coordinated regional effort. In fact, ROC (Regional Oversight
Committee for Animal Health Co-operation in the Middle East), a body
composed of the CVO's of Egypt, Israel, Jordan and the Palestinian
authority, established in 1996, was aware of the problem and sought
international support for a common rabies project, which was decided
upon in a meeting in Aswan (Egypt) in 1999. The "Optimization of
Regional Oral Rabies Vaccination Program" was cooperatively submitted
for international support, which was eventually obtained; but
unfortunately, ROC's annual 2002 meeting, in Aqaba, Jordan, where the
project's details were finalised, became its last meeting and the
project was frozen. Hopefully, efforts to revive the regional
cooperation, undertaken recently, will be fruitful. The experience
gained within the Israeli ORV project since 1998, particularly novel
information regarding the baiting and immune response in jackals,
will be useful as well.
