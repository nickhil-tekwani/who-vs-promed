Fears mount over China bird flu
--------------------------------
An outbreak of bird flu in northwest China is more lethal than
previously thought, UN health experts have warned. They said 5000
migratory birds had died in the outbreak, in Qinghai province, 5
times China's estimate.

"The virus has obviously changed to be more pathogenic to animals.
What it means to humans we don't know," a World Health Organization
official said.

The virus has killed at least 53 people in South East Asia since late
2003, though none of them were in China.

WHO China representative Henk Bekedam said the H5N1 outbreak at Lake
Qinghai was particularly worrying because it affected migratory
birds, including gulls, geese, shelducks and cormorants.

"The biggest concern I would have is that we have many birds that are
asymptomatic and they can fly from here to 1000 km (621 miles)
further up. That's troublesome," he said, the AFP news agency
reported.

The organisation said it was vital that China carry out more tests on
the birds before they begin migrating to other parts of the region.

Chinese authorities have cordoned off a 50-km (31-mile) radius around
Lake Qinghai and nature reserve. However, the WHO says only 12 birds
and 2 people have been tested for the strain so far.

China has not carried out a cull of the birds, a common practice with
infected domesticated flocks, because they are rare and protected
species, the WHO said.

Fears about the H5N1 virus have led to the slaughter of millions of
chickens and ducks across Asia in the last 18 months.

The WHO is alarmed that the more the virus spreads, the greater the
chances it could combine with the human flu virus and trigger a flu
pandemic.

[Indeed, more testing is required to accurately assess if the avian
influenza virus is the only or main causative agent of the mass
mortality observed among several water-bird species at Lake Qinghai.
The pathogenicity of the virus should preferably be tested in wild
birds of the same species, as well as in poultry. In addition, other
etiological factors, including clostridial toxins, should be ruled
out. - Mod.AS]
