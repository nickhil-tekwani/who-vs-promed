Hanover Park Police Department in Chicago, Illinois have warned residents about the rise of the 'zombie' coyote.

According to WNBC, police have told citizens to beware of these creatures who are infected.

The Hanover Park Police department posted a severe warning on their official Facebook page along with some photos of normal coyotes versus infected coyotes to inform people.

Although these animals tend to not be aggressive, police warned they should be avoided at all costs.

The coyotes have something called mange, which is a skin disorder resulting in hair loss.

'Recently we have received several messages and posts from citizens concerned about what appear to be malnourished or neglected stray dogs. These are NOT lost pets, but are in fact coyotes.

'There is unfortunately an increase in sarcoptic mange in the urban coyote populations which has caused these normally nocturnal animals to become more active during the day.

'Infected animals will often appear mangy -- which looks just like it sounds. They suffer hairloss and develop secondary infections, eventually looking like some sort of zombie dog. The infections affect their vision, causing them to look for food during the daylight hours. These infected animals are not normally aggressive, but should be avoided at all times.'

According the University of Illinois there hasn't been a documented coyote bite in Illinois in the past 30 years. The mange, however, is contagious to animals.
