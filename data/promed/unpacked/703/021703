We would like to ask to send a 2nd note via ProMED-mail because the human case has been confirmed, and also because we believe that a new note should explain your quoted remarks regarding the lack of specific detection of West Nile virus [WNV] antibodies in competent hosts (birds) or dead-end hosts (equines).

Our report, in collaboration with CDC in USA, was able to show specific antibodies for WNV in horses and in birds. We were working in 2009 and 2010 in Pantanal region. The tests were based on virus neutralization assays and competitive WNV ELISA to distinguish among various flaviviruses in the best way possible at that time. No other reports had used such techniques in 2010. A new report in 2014 confirms what we reported in 2012. We conclude that competent local hosts in Brazil were seroconverted as early as 2009 and 2010. Moreover, the human cases would have been predicted.

Prior to that work, we published that WNV circulated in South America and was propagated in the local bird population in Venezuela.

[ProMED thanks Irene Bosch for the information concerning confirmation of the human WNV case in Brazil and for the clarification about the methods used for serological testing in the Pantanal, Brazil WNV studies. It is valuable to know that the serological tests used constitute the "gold standard" for specificity of WNV antibodies in the tested sera.

Abstract
In an effort to detect West Nile virus (WNV) in Brazil, we sampled serum from horses and chickens from the Pantanal region of the state of Mato Grosso and tested for flavivirus-reactive antibodies by blocking ELISA. The positive samples were further confirmed for serological evidence of WNV infection in 3 (8 per cent) of the 38 horses and one (3.2 per cent) of the 31 chickens using an 80 per cent plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT80). These results provide evidence of the circulation of WNV in chickens and horses in Pantanal.

Abstract
A recent study reported neutralizing antibodies to West Nile virus (WNV) in horses from 4 ranches of southern Pantanal. To extend that study, a serosurvey for WNV and 11 Brazilian flaviviruses was conducted with 760 equines, 238 sheep and 61 caimans from 17 local cattle ranches. Among the tested equines, 32 were collected from a ranch where a neurologic disorder outbreak had been recently reported. The sera were initially screened by using a blocking ELISA and then titrated by 90 per cent plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT90) for 12 flaviviruses. Employing the criterion of 4-fold greater titer, 78 (10.3 per cent) equines were seropositive for Ilheus virus, 59 (7.8 per cent) for Saint Louis encephalitis virus, 24 (3.2 per cent) for WNV, 2 (0.3 per cent) for Cacipacore virus and one (0.1 per cent) for Rocio virus. No serological evidence was found linking the neurological disease that affected local equines to WNV. All caimans and sheep were negative by blocking ELISA for flaviviruses. There were no seropositive equines for Bussuquara, Iguape, yellow fever and all 4 dengue virus serotypes. The detection of WNV-seropositive equines in 10 ranches and ILHV and SLEV-seropositive equines in 14 ranches of 2 different sub-regions of Pantanal is strong evidence of widespread circulation of these flaviviruses in the region.
