One of the world's deadliest mushrooms is sprouting in the San Francisco area, CBS SF Bay Area reported.

They look good, smell good, and reportedly taste good -- but officials are warning pet owners to keep away from the mushrooms, known as the death cap.

[RN] never guessed that a hike with his dog, last month [OCTOBER 2016] in the Bay Area's Briones Regional Park would be the canine's last. "As far as I knew, everything was normal that day. It wasn't until afterwards that I realized it wasn't normal," [RN] said.

A day after the hike, [RN] discovered that the 5-year-old dog wasn't eating and had blood in his stool. He rushed him to the vet. "They told me that his liver was already destroyed and they could try and save him but it didn't look so good," [RN] said.

[The dog] died, and a mushroom stem was found in his feces. Tests later revealed he had gobbled down a death cap mushroom (_Amanita phalloides_), known to cause liver failure in dogs.

The problem is serious enough that park officials are posting warning signs about death cap and death angel [_Amanita ocreata_] mushrooms.

[The death cap mushroom is known worldwide to cause intoxication and death. The death cap is _Amanita phalloides_ (see picture at http://www.fcps.edu/islandcreekes/ecology/Fungus/Death%20Cap/deathca2.jpg) and is generally mistaken for a non toxic variety. Alternatively it is collected by someone not trained in the subtle differences of mushrooms; someone believing it is a mushroom that has hallucinogenic properties; someone applying some myth, such as it cannot be toxic because it is growing on wood, or in the sun, or other such mushroom nonsense.

Amanitas contain toxins known as amatoxins which are cyclopeptides. This ring of amino acids inhibits production of some proteins, especially in liver and kidney cells. Clinical signs generally begin 5-24 hours post ingestion. Signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. These initial symptoms may resolve briefly, but without treatment there is severe liver and kidney damage and even organ failure which results in coma and death.

In some cases clinical signs and symptoms may not begin for 1-2 days. These signs mimic the flu or other gastrointestinal upset. Consequently treatment is delayed and diagnosis can be difficult. The most prominent sign in animals is gastrointestinal upset. As the article above states it also has a profound effect on the liver. With fluid loss, GI upset and liver failure in a short time, it is difficult to save these animals. Some are fortunate to make it. It is quite a sad situation.

Early treatment may include fluids, antibiotics, and use of liver supportive agents such as the extract of milk thistle which contains the flavonoids silymarin/silybin/silibinin. These flavonoids have been demonstrated to inhibit amatoxin.

The milk thistle flavonoids success with amatoxin has not been able to be duplicated with other toxins, such as aflatoxin, that also affect the liver, but are not related to mushroom toxins. - Mod.TG
