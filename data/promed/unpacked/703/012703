H5N1 virus has not grown more dangerous, experts say
-------------------------------------
An international team of experts has concluded that the H5N1 avian
influenza virus in Vietnam has not recently improved its ability to
spread to or among humans, according to news reports published today.

The finding suggests that the immediate risk of a flu pandemic is
lower than previously believed, according to an Agence France-Presse
(AFP) report.

The report quotes Hans Troedsson, the World Health Organization's
(WHO's) representative in Vietnam, as saying, "What was reported to
the government is that, according to preliminary findings, they could
not find any indication showing that the virus has actually extended
its range in humans."

The specimens analyzed by the team of epidemiologists and virologists
"did not show changes," Troedsson told AFP. He called the finding
"very good news indeed."

"The most important thing is that we could rule out that there was an
immediate, imminent pandemic," Troedsson said. "Since the virus is
widely spread, the risk is still there but not as imminent as we
initially might have suspected."

The story said the team concluded from "preliminary data" that the
virus is not showing any increase in the efficiency of its
transmission from birds to humans or from humans to humans.

In addition, the experts did not find evidence of previously
undetected asymptomatic or mild human cases of H5N1 infection,
Troedsson told AFP. The story did not specify how the team looked for
such evidence.

Hitoshi Oshitani, leader of the team and regional advisor on
communicable disease surveillance for the WHO, struck a cautious tone.

"We did not find any indications to show that the H5N1 virus is
extending its range in humans, though clearly it retains that
capability should it change," the Chinese news service Xinhua quoted
him as saying.

The AFP story quoted Oshitani as saying, "While it's good news that
we haven't documented a significant increase in the extent of
transmission in humans, there is still no greater threat to winning
the battle against avian influenza than complacency."

The team recommended that the Vietnamese government increase its
surveillance of the virus in both animals and humans, Xinhua
reported. In addition, the group advised the Vietnamese to share
samples from future suspected cases with a WHO reference laboratory
outside Vietnam for independent confirmation and quality assurance.

The team included experts from Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan,
the United Kingdom, and the United States, Xinhua reported. They left
Vietnam yesterday after spending a week there.

In May, a panel of experts convened by the WHO in Manila had reported
that changing patterns of cases in northern Vietnam suggested that
the H5N1 virus might be becoming more infectious for humans. The
panel had cited an increase in case clusters, an increase in
patients' average age, and a decrease in the case-fatality rate.

The panel also had said genetic studies indicated that H5N1 viruses
were becoming more antigenically diverse.

In today's AFP report, Troedsson said the experts who just left
Vietnam were able to do "more advanced testing" than had been done at
the time of the Manila meeting. The story didn't say what kinds of
tests were done.

Elsewhere, Singapore said it has begun preparing for a flu pandemic
by stockpiling an antiviral drug and taking steps to secure a
vaccine, according to another AFP report today.

The country's health ministry said it has begun buying oseltamivir
(Tamiflu), which is used to prevent and treat flu. In addition, the
story said, the ministry is exploring possible collaborations with
vaccine manufacturers to produce H5N1 vaccines and ensure access to
vaccines when they become available.

According to the WHO, 108 people have contracted H5N1 infections and
54 have died since the current series of outbreaks began in late 2003.

Avian influenza - situation in Viet Nam - update 24 30 Jun 2005
-----------------------
At the request of the Ministry of Health, WHO sent a team of
international experts to Viet Nam last week to assess laboratory and
epidemiological data on recent cases and determine whether the
present level of pandemic alert should be increased. Team members
were drawn from institutes in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong SAR,
Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America having
extensive experience in the testing of avian influenza viruses in
human clinical specimens.

The team completed its work on Wednesday [29 Jun 2005] and submitted
its preliminary findings to the government. The team found no
laboratory evidence suggesting that human infections are occurring
with greater frequency or that the virus is spreading readily among
humans. The current level of pandemic alert, which has been in effect
since January 2004, remains unchanged.

Some reports now circulating suggest that WHO has downgraded its
assessment of the pandemic threat. These reports are unfounded. The
experts were specifically asked to search for evidence that could
substantiate concerns raised first at a WHO consultation of
international experts held at the beginning of May [2005] in Manila
[For full report of the international consultation referred to here,
see
<http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/WHO_CDS_CSR_GIP_2005_7_04.pdf>
- Mod.MPP]. That consultation considered suggestive findings, largely
based on epidemiological observations, that the H5N1 virus had
changed its behaviour in ways consistent with an improved, though not
yet efficient, ability to spread directly from one human to another.
The specific epidemiological observations considered included milder
disease across a broader age spectrum and a growing number of
clusters of cases, closely related in time and place.

More recently, testing of clinical specimens by international experts
working in Viet Nam provided further suggestive evidence of more
widespread infection with the virus, raising the possibility of
community-acquired infection. These findings have not been confirmed
by the present investigative team.

Firm evidence of improved transmissibility would be grounds for
moving to a higher level of pandemic alert. Because of the huge
consequences of such a change, WHO is following a cautious approach
that combines heightened vigilance for new cases with immediate
international verification of any suggestive findings.

Because the detection of H5N1 in clinical specimens is technically
challenging and prone to errors, members of the investigative team
took sophisticated laboratory equipment with them to Hanoi for
on-site testing. Tests were performed using WHO-approved reagents and
primers.

While these first results are reassuring, further retesting of
clinical specimens will continue over the next few weeks to provide
the most reliable possible foundation for risk assessment.

[This posting was originally prepared on 29 Jun 2005 in response to
the newswire contained in [1] above. At that time, this moderator
wrote the following comment:

"On one hand there is a collective sigh of relief that the predicted
pandemic of influenza due to H5N1 is not felt to be as imminent as
earlier prediction were citing. On the other hand there is the
caution that a pandemic is long overdue, and the H5N1 may still be
the candidate virus for this, just not in the very imminent future.
That being said, it is clear that prediction of where, when and what
will be the next influenza pandemic is still speculative and some
might feel, hazardous (remembering the predictions of swine flu in
1976 as the next pandemic strain).

Good disease surveillance including laboratory support is still of
primary importance in following the situation, coupled with the
capacity to respond with new vaccine production and antivirals to
which the pandemic strain will be susceptible, so that when the
pandemic strain does arise, it will be detected early and morbidity
reduction (through effective vaccine) and mortality reduction
(through effective antivirals) will be in place for rapid
implementation."

With the addition of the WHO update, it appears the international
community is status quo -- the level of pandemic alert has been
neither increased nor decreased. That being said, the above comment
still holds, with the re-affirmation that close monitoring of the
situation through heightened surveillance with epidemiologic and
laboratory enhancements is the most logical way to proceed. - Mod.MPP]
