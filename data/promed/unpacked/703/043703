Avian influenza has recently been confirmed in some birds that are part of Lake Tobias Wildlife Park in Halifax, the park announced.

The infected birds are part of a collection housed in an indoor enclosure, not accessible to the public, the park said. Park spokeswoman Jan Tobias-Kieffer said in a news release that officials at the Bureau of Animal Health and Diagnostic Services of the USDA in Harrisburg determined no widespread euthanasia of zoo birds will be required.

Nationally, a highly contagious strain of avian influence has affected more than 47 million birds. Avian influenza is a disease caused by an infection with avian influenza Type A viruses. It is naturally spread by wild aquatic birds and can infect domestic poultry.

In Pennsylvania, as of 5 Oct 2022, the USDA reported 18 commercial flocks and 3 backyard flocks were affected in the recent outbreak.

Tobias-Kieffer said that, following routine protocol for avian influenza, the domestic birds at the park were tested for the disease, all with negative results. The park staff is working to ensure protocols are followed that will contain the disease to the single enclosure, she said.

As a precaution, several outdoor exotic bird displays are being removed as exhibits to protect them from infection, and will not be available for public viewing for the remainder of the park season, she said.

The City of Long Beach Department of Health and Human Services (Health Department) has confirmed 3 cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5 (avian flu) in 2 Canadian geese and 1 black-crowned night-heron near El Dorado Park.

Additional sick and dead wild birds were also found in the area. The virus has previously been detected in birds in California, but the Long Beach cases are the 1st in Los Angeles County.

Avian flu is very contagious among birds and can sicken and even kill certain domesticated bird species, including chickens, ducks, and turkeys. The current avian flu outbreak occurring in the United States began in February 2022 and has affected over 47 million wild birds and poultry.

While avian flu, also called bird flu, can rarely be transmitted to people or other animals after unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with the virus, the risk of transmission to the general public is very low. The spread of avian flu from person to person is also very rare. Domestic poultry, waterfowl, raptors, and certain shorebirds are at the highest risk of the virus.

The Mexican Animal Health and Food Safety (Senasica) confirmed by tests run in its labs the 1st case of HPAI H5N1 in Mexico. The positive animal was a gyrfalcon (_Falco rusticolus_) that was feeding on wild birds in the Lerma River basin, Estado de Mexico.

The Mexico-USA committee for the prevention of foot-and-mouth disease and other exotic animal diseases is currently conducting further sampling in the region, to confirm presence/absence in wild birds.

"At this point there are not more suspect cases. However, poultry farms and backyard hen holders are urged to raise biosecurity measures, and to abide by all the norms of the National Animal Health Emergency Protocol (Dinesa), and to report immediately any anomaly observed in their animals," an official report said.

HPAI H5N1 has caused severe outbreaks in Europe, USA, and Canada.

With the aim to protect the national poultry production, Dinesa estabished control procedures to move birds and other mandatory measures to avoid the spread of the disease.

"To report presence of an exotic disease or pest, Senasica offers a free-toll call service at 800 751 2100; and the app Avise, available for iOS and Android. Episodes may also be reported to any of the relevant governmental agencies located in all states of Mexico," added the report.

The Eurasian H5N1, first detected in January 2022 on the Atlantic coast of North America, spread rapidly across the continent. After the number of cases declined since June 2022, they seem to be bouncing back. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses.

Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that they are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. Only a few species that migrate and can tolerate these viruses, presumably some Anseriformes, are key players driving the spread of this epidemic. The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species.

The occurrence of HPAI H5N1 in Mexico coincides with the seasonal migration from North to South of some species that winter in that country. - Mod.PMB]
