On 6 Dec 2013, WHO was notified of 2 laboratory confirmed cases of locally acquired chikungunya disease in the French part of the Caribbean isle of St Martin. The other part of the isle is a country that is part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (St Maarten). These 2 cases were confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test performed by the French National Reference Centre for arboviruses in Marseille.

There has been an outbreak of dengue fever on St Martin since January 2013. Chikungunya disease was detected during an investigation following the notification of 5 cases with joint pains and fever on 18 Nov 2013, for whom the diagnosis of dengue was excluded. The onset of symptoms of the 5 cases occurred between 12 Oct -15 Nov 2013.

As of 10 Dec 2013, altogether, 2 confirmed, 4 probable, and 20 suspected cases of chikungunya [virus] infection have been reported.

Chikungunya is a viral disease that is rarely fatal and is transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Symptoms of chikungunya [virus infections] include high fever and headache, with significant pains in the joints (ankles, wrists), which can persist for several weeks. The symptoms appear between 4-7 days after the patient has been bitten by an infected mosquito. The name, chikungunya derives from a word in the Makonde language roughly meaning "that which bends up," reflecting the physique of a person suffering from the disease.

In the absence of specific treatment and an effective human vaccine, preventive measures are based on a dual strategy: 1) Raising awareness of the risk factors for chikungunya infection as well as the protective measures individuals can take to prevent mosquito bites; 2) stopping the proliferation of mosquitoes by reducing their breeding grounds.

This is the 1st time that locally acquired transmission of chikungunya has been detected in the WHO Americas Region.

The health authorities on both the French and the Dutch side of the island are cooperating closely to respond to this outbreak, in close coordination with public health authorities in France and the Netherlands. Actions implemented by local authorities to date include:

- Epidemiological surveillance including syndromic surveillance and surveillance of severe cases.
- Vector control activities have been implemented in the affected area and will rapidly be extended to the entire island, including around airports, schools, day nurseries, hospitals.
- Communication and social mobilization: Information is being disseminated to health professionals, to the public (on individual protection and how to eliminate larvae breeding grounds), and to travelers by specific information in the airports.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

[This report provides WHO official notice of the 1st known outbreak of chikungunya virus infection in the Americas, as previously reported in the 6 Dec 2013 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20131209.2099940). A similar PAHO/WHO summary report of 9 Dec 2013 (http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_view&gid=23806+&Itemid=999999&lang=en) also mentions that in the Americas, imported cases had previously been registered in Brazil, Canada, French Guyana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and the United States of America. All of these countries except Canada have had recent locally transmitted dengue virus infections.

Since _Aedes aegypti_ can transmit both dengue and chikungunya viruses, it is not surprising that chikungunya virus has finally appeared in and been locally transmitted in the Americas. This is not likely to be the last time, given rapid, long-distance transportation of individuals from chikungunya virus endemic areas to countries in the Americas having abundant populations of vector mosquitoes. Because symptoms of chikungunya virus infections can relatively closely resemble those of dengue fever, health authorities in the Americas should expand laboratory testing of dengue-like cases to be sure that chikungunya virus infections are not occurring also. Mixed chikungunya-dengue outbreaks have been occurring in Asia.
