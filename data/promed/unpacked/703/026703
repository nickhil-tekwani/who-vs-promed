This event pertains to the whole country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks: Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Pradikow, Protzel, Markisch-Oderland, Brandenburg
Date of start of the outbreak: 30 Jan 2014
Outbreak status: Resolved (13 Feb 2014)
Epidemiological unit: Farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 714 / 1 / 0 / 1 / 0

Outbreak statistics:
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Cattle / 0.14 percent / 0 percent / 0 percent / 0.14 percent
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction and/or slaughter

Epidemiology:
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment:
As part of the German targeted bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) surveillance system, a BSE-case classified as atypical (H-type) was identified in a cow at slaughter. An epidemiological investigation of the event was conducted. The summary of the event is as follows:

- The cow was slaughtered on 30 Jan 2014 at the age of 11 years and 4 months without clinical signs.

- Results from the immuno blot tests at the NRL (Friedrich Loeffler-Institute) confirmed the animal positive for atypical BSE of the H-type, a very rare form of the disease not associated with feeding.

- The animal's carcass has been destroyed. The identified animal did not enter the food channels; at no time did it present any risk to human health.

- The epidemiological investigation identified 8 offspring cattle, 3 of which were already slaughtered, one of which has fallen, and 4 of which have been traded to another Member State. The tracing of the bovines born on the farm from one year before until one year after the birth of the identified cow revealed 371 bovines (177 have been already slaughtered; 63 were fallen [naturally dead] stock; 3 have been traded within the territory of Germany; 127 have been traded to other States; one has been culled and destroyed). The OIE does not recognize an atypical form of BSE as a distinct entity for the purpose of its international standards; it is not mentioned in the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code, which does not distinguish between different forms of BSE.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; screening; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); modified stamping out; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Friedrich-Loeffler Institute (National laboratory) / Cattle / western blot / 4 Feb 2014 / Positive
Future Reporting:
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.
