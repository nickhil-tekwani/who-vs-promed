The Philippine government Sat, 1 Oct 2005, confirmed an outbreak of cholera
in the province of Catanduanes in the Bicol region, central Philippines.
Eric Tayag, director of the Department of Health National Epidemiology
Center, said in an interview with local television network ANC that 5
people have been killed in a total of 180 cholera cases in Catanduanes.
The health department had earlier confirmed a similar outbreak in the
neighboring province of Camarines Sur. The number of people killed or
affected by the epidemic there is still unknown.
"There's an outbreak of cholera in San Andres, Catanduanes. The
epidemiologist are still conducting the investigations and there might be
an association of cases from Caramoan, Camarines Sur, which is just across
Catanduanes," Tayag said. He also said that doctors are looking at the
possibility of person-to-person transmission or common source transmission
for the cases. While advising residents in the affected areas to purify
water prior to consumption, he added that chlorine must be used in areas
where residents have no facilities to boil water for drinking.

Due to the severe cholera outbreak in Tharawaddy Prison in central Burma,
more than 40 inmates including a political prisoner died on 27 Sep 2005
alone, according to sources close to the prison.
The dead political prisoner is said to be an Arakan Communist Party member,
a native of Yanbye in western Burma, who had been detained since 1986.
According to a prison staff member, who doesn't want to be named, prison
governor Myint Swe told a medic not to record the reason for [the
prisoner's] death as cholera.
Prisoners' families are very anxious for the welfare of their loved ones.
They urged Rangoon-based International Committee for Red Cross (ICRC)
representatives to visit and inspect the prison as soon as possible.

At least 29 members of a rare tribe in Dhindori district in Madhya Pradesh
have died and several more have taken ill in the past few days due to
cholera. The primitive Baiga tribe has been hit hard by a number of
waterborne diseases in the recent times. The regular outbreaks of cholera,
malaria, gastroenteritis, diarrhea, and jaundice have become a great cause
of concern for the authorities.
"7 people have been suffering in the village from cholera over 15 days. The
doctors have come to the village now. But, still many people are suffering
from it," said Karmu Baiga, a tribal [representative?]. However,
authorities say the medical team has been working 24 hours in the district
to keep the situation under control.
Dr. B.N. Sharma said the deaths have been caused due to the consumption of
contaminated water and the general eating habits of the tribe. "The deaths
are mainly due to cholera because of contaminated water and food. They live
in very unhygienic conditions. The lifestyle of this tribe is such that
they eat stale food and drink water from anywhere," he said.
The Baiga tribe of Madhya Pradesh are the indigenous people who have lived
in the forested areas of districts Mandla Balaghat Bilaspur and Rajnandgaon
since time immemorial.

[4] Cholera - West Africa

At least 800 people have been killed in a cholera epidemic which has struck
nearly 50 000 in West Africa, many since mid-2005, WHO said on Tue, 27 Sep
2005. Outbreaks of the water-borne disease were triggered by a
particularly heavy rainy season, compounded by increased population
movements, according to Claire-Lise Chaignat, WHO's global cholera coordinator.
"It is worse overall compared with previous years, because there are big
outbreaks in 3 countries -- Senegal, Mauritania and Guinea-Bissau,"
Chaignat told a news briefing. "We are concerned it might move into
southern Africa and the Horn of Africa, where the season starts soon," she
added, citing Mozambique, South Africa, Somalia and Zimbabwe as being at risk.
Senegal, where the situation has been made worse by flooding in the capital
Dakar, is hardest hit, reporting 320 deaths among 24 111 cases since Jan
2005, according to the United Nations agency. Some 1212 new cases were
reported last week alone in Senegal, where the WHO said it was concerned
about its further spread due to population movements during the Ramadan
Muslim holy month starting next week.
Tiny Guinea-Bissau follows, with 278 deaths among 16 424 cases since Jun
2005. This meant 1.1 percent of its population of 1.5 million was suffering
from the disease, a "very high rate", according to the WHO expert.
Niger, which is battling food shortages and malnutrition due to drought and
locust invasions in 2004, has reported 46 deaths among 455 cases since
mid-Jul 2005. This gave it the highest case fatality rate, some 10.1
percent. "People are much more vulnerable to getting cholera as a severe
disease if they are already malnourished," Chaignat said.
In all, 8 countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Mali,
Mauritania, Niger and Senegal), have reported some 46 569 cases with 804
deaths, according to a Reuters tally of the WHO figures issued in Geneva.

The current wave of cholera outbreaks which had begun several weeks ago in
West Africa is still ongoing (for map see original URL). Seasonal factors,
with a particularly heavy rainy season, along with increased population
movements in the area, contribute to this unusually high incidence of cholera.
WHO, with international and national health partners, is providing
technical support to the ministries of health at the country and
sub-regional level. WHO is working to strengthen surveillance
activity. Supplies for case management and chlorination of water have also
been dispatched to some of the countries.
Breakdown by country:
Benin: The outbreak which started in Cotonou in early June 2005 has now
spread to the Oueme region. A total of 210 cases including 4 deaths has
been reported between 6 Jun and 4 Sep 2005. Information is being provided
to the community and water points are being chlorinated.
Burkina Faso: A total of 615 cases including 9 deaths (case fatality rate,
CFR, 1.5 percent) have been reported in Ouagadougou town between 8 Aug and
4 Sep 2005, affecting sectors of the town with precarious water and
sanitation conditions. Efficient control measures have been put in place,
focusing on providing relevant information to the public. The outbreak
currently seems to be under control.
Guinea: 1956 cases including 72 deaths (CFR 3.7 percent) have been reported
between mid-July and 4 Sep 2005. Control efforts are ongoing with special
emphasis on environmental management for the 2 most affected towns, Conakry
and Kindia.
Guinea-Bissau: 14 303 cases including 252 deaths (CFR 1.8 percent) between
6 Jun and 11 Sep 2005. The regions of Bissau and Bimbo account for 77
percent of cases; cholera has spread to all 11 regions of the country. A
WHO team is currently providing on site support to the Ministry of health.
Mali: 158 cases including 20 deaths (CFR 12.65 percent) have occurred
between 20 Jun and 24 Jul 2005. The situation appears to be under control,
although cholera is an ongoing problem in Mali.
Mauritania: A total of 2640 cases including 55 deaths (CFR 2 percent) has
been reported from 6 regions between 20 Jul and 21 Sep 2005. Nouakchott
accounts for 89 percent of all the cases.
Niger: Between 10 and 19 Sep 2005, 72 cases including 9 deaths have been
reported from Tahoua region, with Bouza district being the most affected.
The outbreak is spreading to the Tilaberi region, which reported 3 cases
from Tera district. To date, a total of 431 cases including 44 deaths (CFR
10 percent) has been reported between 13 Jul and 19 Sep 2005.
Senegal: A resurgence of the cholera outbreak which started early this year
has recently occurred. Dakar is most affected, due to the unusually heavy
rains. To date, a total of 23 325 cases including 303 deaths (CFR 1.2
percent) has been reported during the outbreak which began in January and
peaked at the end of March 2005.

Guinea-Bissau continues its emergency activities in the ongoing fight
against a deadly cholera outbreak, in collaboration with the Ministry of
Health and other partners. UNICEF has rushed essential supplies to affected
populations, including the provision of oral re-hydration salt packets,
disinfectants and logistic support, along with essential drugs and medical
supplies (e.g. sodium lactate solution and glucose injections). These
medicines and supplies are critical as an immediate response to prevent
dehydration and death.
As of 28 Sep 2005, 16 678 cases and 284 deaths have been reported in
Guinea-Bissau since the beginning of the cholera outbreak in Jun 2005. As a
result of concerted efforts by the government and national and
international partners, a reduction in the cases and deaths has been noted
over the past 4 weeks. From a peak of 2088 cases and 53 deaths during the
week of 22-28 Aug 2005, there has been a continuous decline in cases,
although the situation is still critical: during the week of 19-25 Sep
2005, 903 cases and 7 deaths were reported.
"We are working to ensure that no more unnecessary deaths due to cholera,
especially among children, occur," said Dr. Nilda Lambo, UNICEF
Guinea-Bissau's Health Officer. "Beyond the immediate response to the
current epidemic, we continue to work closely with the Government and
partners for the promotion of sanitary and hygienic practices."

The department of state for Health (DoSH) has alerted the general public to
the outbreak of cholera in the country.
According to a press release issued by DoSH yesterday, 27 Sep 2005, a small
number of people have already contracted the disease and admitted at the
Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital.
It added that the confirmed cases have a history of traveling outside The
Gambia "for one reason or another." In view of the highly contagious
nature of the disease, the release stated, the Department of State for
Health has called on the general public, especially those planning to
travel outside The Gambia, to be "very vigilant."
"Reliable sources indicate that the West African bloc is the most affected
region in the cholera outbreak. It's hereby recommended that those who plan
traveling to the sub-region should consider the inherent risk involved. If
for any reason that individuals must travel, the following preventive
measures are to be observed strictly: To prepare and pre-pack their own
drinking water and foodstuff to be used during the course of their stay; to
exercise maximum personal hygiene at all times; to properly wash fresh
foods and fruits before consumption; to wash hands properly after using
toilet facilities before handling food and water; to thoroughly cook
foodstuff well before consumption," the release stated.

[9] Cholera - Uganda, Congo DR

The health ministry has closed all markets along the Uganda-Congo border
after establishing that the current cholera outbreak emerged from the DR
Congo. The ministry also banned transportation of fish fastened on bonnets
[car hoods] and selling juice in water bottles, saying it was the quickest
way of spreading cholera.
Health state minister Capt. Mike Mukula said they closed the border markets
because districts near them would be easily affected as people moved in and
out of the country. He said 4 people had died out of the 74 cases reported
in the last week in the districts of Kotido, Nebbi, Arua, Kasese,
Bundibugyo, Masindi and Kampala. Mukula said they would also close Kampala
buildings, markets, butcher shops and other shops with poor hygiene, citing
butcher shops in Kalerwe and Mulago.
