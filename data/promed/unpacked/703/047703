A recent meeting at Cardiff was mainly concerned with the immunological
aspects of anthrax infection. My presentation [on the recent anthrax cases
in the UK] was a curtain raiser, reminding the delegates that patients are
what matter at the end of the day. A subsequent meeting in London was
concerned with anthrax acquired by association with bongo-drumming.

The 2 fatal UK cases were both originally diagnosed as suffering from other
community acquired infections, as per the stilt dancer, and the
microbiology laboratories workers were the ones that came up with the
answer, unfortunately in the case of Mr Pascal Norris some 4 weeks after
his death.

Both Norris and Gomez had previous underlying disease in the form of acute
myeloid leukemia and pulmonary tuberculosis, though both were said to be in
remission/cured. By comparison, the US stilt dancer was incredibly fit with
tremendous lung function capability; he survived.

The father and son, despite widespread environmental contamination of home
and work areas [as per the stilt dancer], only suffered with cutaneous
anthrax. The house/workshop of Norris was "clear" as was the flat/workplace
of Gomez. I might add here that the cat of Mr Gomez was also "clear." The
story of Chica the cat I can give you at another time if you want. So with
negative/minimal environmental contamination, our guys die whilst your 3
survived in the presence of widespread environmental contamination.

So what is the risk of bongo-drumming? Is it the playing or the making of
the drums? Both UK and USA views have been that the riskier procedure is
the making of the drum skins from the animal hides when shaving is
involved, playing the actual drums much less so. But in the case of Mr
Norris, his clinical strain was not dissimilar to that found on drums used
in a bongo session in the village hall. As an aside, the 2 people who ran
the drumming session lived in a house where there was environmental
contamination with anthrax spores in a bedroom where drums were stored but
suffered no ill effects. In the case of Mr Gomez, his clinical strain was
not dissimilar to those found from animal hides stored in a cupboard under
the stairs. Gomez had a positive drum in his flat, but this was different
from his clinical strain.

So what is the real risk of bongo drumming? It is very low, I should think.
Humans are relatively resistant to anthrax, in my opinion, with an ID of
10s of 1000s. Having said that, there will always be those who will be
infected by much lower doses -- for example, Norris, Gomez or the elderly
lady from Connecticut in the Amerithrax outbreak. But given the large
number of people who do play bongo drums -- and I have discussed this with
German colleagues too, we have 5 known cases to date -- it is possible that
cutaneous cases are missed as per Amerithrax, when 5/6 cutaneous cases of
anthrax had been missed [by reporting] but were treated before Robert
Stevens succumbed. And unless appropriate microbiological investigations
are performed, even inhalation cases could be classed as community acquired
pneumonia.

I'll leave you with the sheriff's summing up at the end of the Fatal
Accident Inquiry into Pascal Norris's death: "He was the wrong person in
the wrong place at the wrong time."

[Our thanks to Bob for his informed insights. The aspect to keep in mind is
not so much the exposure dose of spores but the ability of individual
people to clear their lungs of those inhaled spores. The present LD50 for
healthy young adults is around 55 000 spores. The majority who died in the
Sverdlovsk accident were heavy smokers as well as having chronic
industrial/occupational lung damage. If the mucociliarly bed in your
bronchioles is inefficient, you are in trouble with even what would
otherwise be a trivial exposure. With increased clinical awareness, we can
expect to see additional cases being reported, though what percentage they
are of those exposed and the true range of exposures will probably be
always unknown. - Mod.MHJ]
