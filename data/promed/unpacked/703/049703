Almost 100 Russian tourists received medical assistance after
suspected food poisoning in the Turkish resort city of Alanya [Antalya
province], officials said on Wednesday [27 Jul 2011].

According to RIA Novosti, Russia's tourist watchdog said 98 tourists
had been affected and 8 remained in the hospital. Turkish health
officials have taken samples of the Club Gunes Garden hotel's food and
drinks, where all the tourists were staying.

A total of 5 Russian tourists died in the Turkish port city of Bodrum
in late May 2011 after drinking bootleg whiskey on a sailing trip
organized by a local company.
