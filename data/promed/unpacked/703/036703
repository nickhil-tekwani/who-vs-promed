Summary of 2nd WHO consultation on clinical aspects of human
infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus
-----------------------------------------------
The 2nd WHO consultation on clinical aspects of human infection with
avian influenza A(H5N1) virus was held on 19-21 Mar 2007 in Antalya,
Turkey. Since the last meeting in Hanoi in May 2005, 8 new countries
have reported human infections with avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses.
Clinicians, epidemiologists, virologists and public health
specialists from the countries with human cases, and experts in
pulmonary medicine, critical care, and influenza attended the meeting
to share their experiences.
Participants agreed that standardizing care and promptly sharing
clinical and treatment information are critically important to
understanding the disease in humans and to improving clinical management.
Observations and experiences, including unpublished data, were shared
by participants during the consultation. Several conclusions
regarding management of patients with H5N1 illness support and expand
current WHO guidance.
Experiences with early oseltamivir treatment suggest its usefulness
in reducing H5N1-associated mortality. In addition, evidence of
prolonged H5N1 virus replication indicates that treatment is
warranted even with late presentation.
As previously discussed, modified regimens of oseltamivir treatment,
including 2-fold higher dosage, longer duration and possibly
combination therapy with amantadine (in countries where the H5N1
virus is susceptible to amantadine) may be considered on a case by
case basis, especially in patients with pneumonia or progressive
disease. Ideally, this should be done in the context of prospective
data collection.
Corticosteroid therapy has failed so far to show effectiveness, and
prolonged or high dose corticosteroids can result in serious adverse
events in H5N1 patients, including opportunistic infection.
Corticosteroids should not be used routinely, except for persistent
septic shock with suspected adrenal insufficiency.
Antibiotic prophylaxis should not be used. When pneumonia is present,
antibiotic treatment is appropriate initially for community-acquired
pneumonia according to published evidence-based guidelines. When
available, the results of microbiologic studies should be used to
guide antibiotic usage in patients with A(H5N1) infection.
Therapy for H5N1-associated ARDS should be based upon published
evidence-based guidelines for sepsis-associated ARDS, specifically
including lung protective mechanical ventilation with low tidal volume.
The observations from the meeting will be published in greater detail
as an updated WHO guidance on H5N1 clinical management followed by a
meeting summary in the form of a peer-reviewed article in the
scientific literature.
