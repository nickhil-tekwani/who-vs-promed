Encephalitis is plaguing in 31 provinces and cities in Vietnam, having affected 325 people and killed 5 of them this year [2014], health authorities said.

The disease mainly affects children under the age of 15, yet hospitals also received some adults suffering encephalitis in the last months. There have been an increasing number of Japanese encephalitis cases in children.

A 20-year-old female patient in Dong Anh, Hanoi has been hospitalized in the National Tropical Disease Hospital for over a week and received intensive treatment in emergency room, but she is in a coma and her health condition is poor. Dr. Nguyen Trung Cap, deputy head of the Emergency Ward, said that this patient was experiencing convulsion fits and feeble limbs, and she was put on a breathing machine. It is anticipated that she can't survive and she would suffer after-effects on the brain nerve and kinetic system.

Dr. Cap added that 2 more female patients in Hanoi suffering from Japanese encephalitis were hospitalized in severe condition. Moreover, tests showed that they were suffering brain and spinal cord injuries.

Dr. Cap advised people not to neglect the disease, though Japanese encephalitis rarely occurs in adults. However, medical experts are worried as there are 3 severe Japanese encephalitis cases in adults.

Soon after they have lasting high fever and a headache along with vomiting, people should go to hospital in order to minimize after-effects.

In the northern provinces, 129 children with encephalitis are being treated at the Central Pediatrics Hospital in Hanoi, including 46 suffering from Japanese encephalitis.

Dr. Do Thien Hai, deputy head of the Infection Sector, said that from end of June [2014], Japanese encephalitis cases in children increased dramatically. Noticeably, the proportion of infection cases this year [2014] is 20 per cent higher than in previous years.

Dr. Tran Dac Phu, who heads the Department of Preventive Medicine, said that encephalitis due to virus, including Japanese encephalitis [virus], is a fatal disease and can be caused by various viruses.

Signs of the disease include high fever and other symptoms relating to injuries in the central nervous system including headache, sensitivity to light, general malaise, stiff neck, stiff back, vomiting, confusion, memory loss, seizures, paralysis and coma.

Children aged below 15 are most vulnerable to the disease. Encephalitis can appear all year round, but its peak times are in June, July and August.

According to the Department of Preventive Medicine's latest statistics, of the total number of patients, 65.8 per cent were in the northern region, while 12.3, 17.5 and 4.4 percent were in the central, southern regions and Central Highlands respectively. Cases are scattered.

There is no specific vaccine against viral encephalitis, except Japanese encephalitis, said Dr. Tran Dac Phu. Vaccine against Japanese encephalitis has been included in the National Expanded Immunization program since 1997, and immunization has been carried out at 580 districts of 60 cities and provinces across the country.

The Department of Preventive Medicine asked municipal and provincial people's committee to mobilize the participation of all sectors and take measures against viral encephalitis and improve treatment efficiency to minimize mortality and bar cross-infection at health facilities.

Early detection of infected people is required to isolate the area and handle the outbreaks. Vaccination should be conducted among children of the [indicated] age to ensure a high rate of immunization.

People should clean the houses and farms to prevent mosquitoes and sleep under mosquito nets.

[Transmission of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is increasing at this time. Viet Nam is endemic for JEV. As indicated in a GIDEON summary of the disease posted on 18 Jun 2010 (ProMED-mail archive no. 20100618.2051), Japanese encephalitis was 1st reported in Viet Nam in 1960. Most cases of Japanese encephalitis in Viet Nam occur in the south during the rainy and early dry season; and in the north during late summer and autumn. Nationally, 73 per cent of the population lives in areas of risk. The country maintains a routine vaccination program for Japanese encephalitis, but apparently some children are not covered. Perhaps these recent cases mentioned above will result in intensification of the vaccination program, as the transmission season is occurring currently in the south and will be increasing in the north of the country in coming weeks.

Wild birds, especially ardeids, are reservoirs of JEV. Pigs are amplifying hosts. Several _Culex_ mosquito species are efficient vectors of the virus, transmitting the virus among wild birds and pigs and to humans. Vaccination and avoidance of mosquito bites are the only measures available to avoid infection and disease.
