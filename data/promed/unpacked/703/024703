[Contagious equine metritis (CEM) is a highly communicable venereal disease of horses. This disease can spread rapidly from a single asymptomatic carrier, particularly a stallion. It was 1st documented in the 1970s, when epidemics among thoroughbred horses spread rapidly in Europe, North and South America, Australia and other countries. Although the causative organism has been eradicated from some countries, including the USA, it is still present in others and continues to affect international trade. Infected horses do not become ill or die, but reproductive success is severely reduced. Mares develop acute metritis and fail to conceive, resulting in substantial economic losses. Additional economic costs include the cost of pre-breeding tests in endemic areas, as well as surveillance screening before importation into CEM-free countries. Immunity is weak, and animals may become infected repeatedly. Imported animals or semen can cause outbreaks in CEM-free regions.

_T. equigenitalis_ is transmitted mainly during mating. It can also be spread by infected semen during artificial insemination or introduced to the genital tract on fomites. The transmission rate is extremely high. Stallions are the most common source of the infection. In untreated stallions, _T. equigenitalis_ can persist for months or years on the reproductive tract, particularly in the urethral fossa and its associated sinus. This organism also occurs in the distal urethra as well as on the exterior of the penis and prepuce, and occasionally in the pre-ejaculatory fluid. Mares can carry _T. equigenitalis_ asymptomatically after they recover from acute disease. The vast majority of carrier mares maintain this organism on the clitoris, particularly in the clitoral sinuses and fossa, but a few carry it in the uterus. Foals (especially colts) born to infected mares can carry bacteria on the external genitalia and may become long-term asymptomatic carriers. There is no evidence that _T. equigenitalis_ survives long-term in a free-living form in the environment.

There is no evidence that _T. equigenitalis_ infects humans.

For this and additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the fact sheet "Contagious equine metritis", prepared by the Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, available at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/contagious_equine_metritis.pdf.

If this is the 1st time that the disease is detected in South Korea, it would be of interest if information about the affected population is available, such as: the origin of the affected animals, the sex of the infected animals (only mares, or also colts), whether or not the affected farms used only artificial insemination or whether they used a stud to cover mares, and if artificial insemination, the source of the semen.

For this event, the disease is being reported as a sub-clinical infection; that is, the affected animals were serologically positive but showed no clinical signs. The OIE Code Chapter on CEM defines a case as an individual animal infected by a pathogenic agent, with or without clinical signs (http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=glossaire.htm). - Mod.CRD
