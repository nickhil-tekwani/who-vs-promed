All [recent] cases of rabies in Kharkov have been associated with
cats.
Today [2 Mar 2011], in one of the Kharkov's districts, the local
government has introduced a quarantine. A cat from this district died
from rabies in a private animal clinic. Five people are under
suspicion [of exposure to rabies virus infection], and among them is a
veterinarian who was not using adequate infection control procedures
with animals.
This case is the 4th [recent] case of rabies among cats in Kharkov,
and this is the 3rd quarantine to be declared by the Epidemiological
Surveillance Centre in Kharkov since the beginning of the year
[2011].

[In general, the epizootic situation with regard to rabies is quite
serious in Ukraine. Already, during the 1st 2 months of 2011, there
have been cases of rabies registered in Chernigov and in several
districts of the Kharkov region. Cats were the source of infection in
all 4 cases recorded in Kharkov. - Corr.VM]
