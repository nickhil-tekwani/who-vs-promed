[1] Booster vaccines
[A] Bivalent mRNA vaccine effectiveness

A US study of the vaccine effectiveness (VE) of the new bivalent mRNA COVID-19 boosters estimates that they confer 28% to 56% more protection against symptomatic infections than 2 to 4 doses of the original mRNA vaccines.

Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Eagle Health Analytics in San Antonio published the research yesterday [22 Nov 2022] in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report [see citation below].

On 1 Sep 2022, the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended the bivalent (2-strain) vaccines, which include components of both wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 strains, for Americans 12 years and older (Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine) or adults only (Moderna vaccine) who had completed a primary monovalent (single-strain) vaccine series at least 2 months earlier.

On 12 Oct 2022, the ACIP recommendation was expanded to include children aged 5 to 11 years. The new vaccines were developed to address the waning effectiveness of monovalent vaccines against Omicron, but no clinical efficacy data on the bivalent formulations were available at recommendation.

The CDC researchers assessed bivalent booster VE using the national Increasing Community Access to Testing program, which included data from 360 626 COVID-19 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) performed from 14 Sep to 11 Nov 2022 at 9995 retail pharmacies in adults who had COVID-19 symptoms but no immunocompromising conditions. Most tests (81%) were conducted during omicron BA.4/BA.5 predominance.

Of the 360,626 NAATs, 34% were positive for COVID-19. Among the case patients, 24% were unvaccinated, 72% had received 2 to 4 monovalent vaccine doses but no bivalent booster dose, and 5% had received a bivalent dose. Among the 238 939 uninfected controls, 30% were unvaccinated, 63% had received 2 to 4 monovalent vaccine doses but no bivalent booster dose, and 7% had gotten a bivalent booster dose.

The median interval between bivalent booster vaccination and COVID-19 testing was 1 month and did not vary by test result. A greater proportion of participants who tested negative at least 90 days before the current test (43%) reported a COVID-19 infection than those who tested positive (22%) in that timeframe.

Absolute VE (aVE) of a bivalent booster dose after 2 or more monovalent doses was 28% among participants aged 50 to 64 and 22% among those 65 years and older, although it varied slightly by number of previous monovalent doses. Of adults 18 to 49 years old who received at least 2 monovalent doses, aVE was 43% higher than those of older age groups and didn't vary by number of previous monovalent doses.

VE of a bivalent booster dose relative to that of 2 or more monovalent doses 2 to 3 or 8 months earlier was 30% and 56%, respectively, among 18- to 49-year-olds; 31% and 48% among those aged 50 to 64; and 28% and 43% among those 65 years and older.

The study authors said the results were the 1st published VE estimates for the bivalent booster vaccines. They said the aVE should be interpreted carefully because unvaccinated people might behave differently or be at different levels of risk for infection than vaccinated people, important factors considering that more than 90% of American adults have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose.

"Bivalent mRNA booster doses provide additional protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in immunocompetent persons who previously received monovalent vaccine only, with relative benefits increasing with time since receipt of the most recent monovalent vaccine dose," the researchers wrote. "Staying up to date with COVID-19 vaccination, including getting a bivalent booster dose when eligible, is critical to maximizing protection against COVID-19."

Summary
-------
"What is already known about this topic?
Monovalent mRNA COVID-19 vaccines were less effective against symptomatic infection during the period of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant predominance.

"What is added by this report?
In this study of vaccine effectiveness of the US-authorized bivalent mRNA booster formulations, bivalent boosters provided significant [28%-56%] additional protection against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in persons who had previously received 2, 3, or 4 monovalent vaccine doses. Due to waning immunity of monovalent doses, the benefit of the bivalent booster increased with time since receipt of the most recent monovalent vaccine dose.

"What are the implications for public health practice?
All persons should stay up to date with recommended COVID-19 vaccinations, including bivalent booster doses for eligible persons."

[B] EU: COVID-19 vaccine booster shot from Sanofi, GSK approved
Date: Tu 10 Nov 2022 8:02 PM GMT+1
Source: Reuters [edited]
https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/eu-regulator-approves-sanofis-covid-shot-beta-variant-booster-2022-11-10/


Sanofi (SASY.PA) said on Thursday [10 Nov 2022] it won European Union approval for its COVID-19 vaccine booster, jointly made with British partner GSK (GSK.L), after a drawn-out development effort that saw the pair fall behind now-dominant vaccine suppliers.

The shot with the brand name VidPrevtyn Beta can be given to people who have already had a primary course of vaccination from other approved shots, the French drugmaker and the European Medicines Agency said in separate statements.

Shipments are ready to be distributed to European countries under advance purchase agreements, Sanofi said. The company said last year that the European Union and Britain had ordered a combined 75 million doses of the shot, contingent on approval.

The shot is based on lab-made viral proteins provided by Sanofi and an adjuvant ingredient from GSK that increases the immune response. By contrast, approved mRNA shots instruct human cells to produce viral proteins that alarm the immune system.

Sanofi's booster contains surface proteins of the Beta coronavirus variant, which was first identified in South Africa in mid-2020 and supplanted during 2021 by delta, and later by omicron.

Adapting the older protein technology chosen by Sanofi and GSK to a new virus variant requires several months longer than under the mRNA approach, which saw a breakthrough during the pandemic.

The European Medicines Agency said in its statement it concluded from studies based on blood analysis of participants that a booster dose of VidPrevtyn Beta should be at least as effective as Pfizer (PFE.N) and BioNTech's (22UAy.DE) 1st-generation shot at restoring protection against COVID-19.

Work on the shot by Sanofi and GSK, 2 of the world's largest vaccine makers by sales, was delayed repeatedly.

The 1st generation of their joint candidate did not produce the desired protection in the elderly in 2020. The partners later pivoted to targeting the beta variant, requiring months in additional development time.

The dominant vaccine makers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) this year [2022] cemented their lead in European and US markets by launching booster shots specifically addressing the omicron variant.

A similar version of the shot was shown in June [2022] to confer protection against the omicron variant of the virus in a late-stage trial involving 13 000 adults.

While the shot tested at the time was bivalent -- meaning it was based both on the original Wuhan strain of the virus and beta -- Sanofi and GSK later focused on a monovalent shot based on the beta only.

[C] Australia: Australian Technical Advisory Group (ATAGI) recommendations
Date: Thu 15 Nov 2022
Source: Department of Health and Aged Care, Australia (press release) [edited]
https://www.health.gov.au/ministers/the-hon-mark-butler-mp/media/new-covid-19-vaccines-for-eligible-australians


The Australian Government has accepted a recommendation from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) on the use of the Pfizer Comirnaty Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine as a 3rd and 4th dose in people aged 18 years and older.

ATAGI has found this next generation vaccine triggers a modest improvement in the immune response against both strains. This vaccine and the original vaccines still provide significant protection from severe disease against Omicron subvariant infections.

The 1st doses of the bivalent vaccine have arrived in the country and are undergoing batch testing by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA). Rollout of this vaccine will commence from 12 Dec 2022.

This is the 2nd bivalent vaccine approved for use in Australia. The Moderna Spikevax Bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 vaccine has been available for people aged 18 years or older since 14 Oct 2022.

A separate recommendation from ATAGI to make the paediatric Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine available for certain at-risk children aged 6 months to under 5 years has also been accepted. This vaccine will become available for eligible children from mid-January 2023.

The Pfizer vaccine is being restricted to children who are severely immunocompromised or who have other specific conditions that put them at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19.

The best vaccine is the one available to you. Australians can check their eligibility at https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/atagi-recommended-covid-19-doses-and-vaccines and book a vaccine appointment at https://covid-vaccine.healthdirect.gov.au/booking/.

[D] Hong Kong: bivalent mRNA vaccines to be made available
Date: Fri 25 Nov 2022 23:01 HKT
Source: The Government of Hong Kong SAR Press Releases [edited]
https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/202211/25/P2022112500520.htm


The 1st batch of about 770 000 doses of the Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 bivalent vaccine (that is, Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 (15/15 micrograms)/dose dispersion for injection COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified)) by Fosun Pharma/BioNTech arrived in Hong Kong today (25 Nov 2022] as arranged by Fosun Pharma.

Soon after the arrival of the batch of Comirnaty bivalent vaccine in Hong Kong, government staff carried out stringent checking and inspection in accordance with established procedures to ensure that the vaccine complies with the product specifications and that the transportation process follows the relevant cold-chain requirements. The Government will put the vaccine in validated ultra-low temperature freezers to ensure its proper storage in accordance with the temperature specified by the drug manufacturer.

The Government plans to start providing the bivalent vaccination service to members of the public from early December [2022] and details will be announced later. According to expert advice, the Comirnaty bivalent vaccine can be used as an alternative to the fourth dose (or the third dose for recovered persons) for eligible persons aged 12 or above following the current vaccination schedule, while Sinovac and Comirnaty ancestral strain vaccines could still be used.

The experts recommended 2 groups of persons to receive the 4th dose (or 3rd dose for recovered persons): (1) people aged 50 or above, and (2) immunocompromised persons aged 12 or above. People aged 18 to 49 may also choose to receive the 4th dose after considering the individual risk and benefit (such as at a higher risk of COVID-19 exposure or with personal needs).

The Government has procured a total of 1.9 million doses of the Comirnaty bivalent vaccine from the manufacturer and the remaining doses are expected to be transported to Hong Kong by the end of 2022. The Government will closely monitor the demand for the bivalent vaccine and purchase additional doses if needed.

The Government strongly urges members of the public to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Details of the COVID-19 Vaccination Programme can be found at the designated website https://www.covidvaccine.gov.hk.

[2] Omicron subvariant BQ1.1
[A] USA (Boston, Massachusetts)
Date: Mon 21 Nov 2022 7:01 PM EST
Source: The Boston Globe [abridged, edited]
https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/11/21/nation/new-coronavirus-variant-has-taken-over-sparking-concerns-winter-surge/


A new subvariant has taken over as the predominant version of coronavirus circulating in Massachusetts, causing experts to worry about a potential rise of infections this winter, especially as people gather indoors for the holidays. But for most people who have been fully vaccinated, they say, it will likely pose more of a nuisance than a serious health threat.

The Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard projected last Thursday [17 Nov 2022] that the virus, an offshoot of the omicron family dubbed BQ.1.1, accounted for 39 percent of COVID-19 cases in the state. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Friday [18 Nov 2021] that the variant and its predecessor, BQ.1, constituted nearly half of cases nationwide.

The spread of BQ.1.1 is of concern because multiple small studies published earlier this month [November 2022] suggest the variant is among the best yet at evading antibody immunity, the body's 1st line of defense against infections. Even people who recently received new bivalent booster shots from Pfizer or Moderna -- which were updated to match the formerly dominant BA.5 variant -- have alarmingly low antibodies to protect against the new virus.

"We could see a lot of COVID in the winter," said Dr Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital. But he notes that people who got the new boosters had more antibodies to BQ.1.1 than those who only received the original boosters. "So it's better than nothing."

Researchers also caution that BQ.1.1 could pose a greater threat to immunocompromised people and those who develop severe infections. Throughout the pandemic, medicines made from synthetic antibodies helped prevent or treat infections in those with a high risk of developing severe disease. But as the virus evolved, fewer of these medicines remained effective. As a result, the 2 remaining antibody medicines -- bebtelovimab to treat COVID-19 and Evusheld to prevent it -- aren't expected to work against the new variant.

Recently released data from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health show that COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have remained relatively unchanged this fall [2022], and in some cases might be slowing down. Wastewater data across the state also indicates the spread of the virus has plateaued, at least for now.

"There's no sign of a wave or a surge of any kind," said Bronwyn MacInnis, the director of Pathogen Genomic Surveillance at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard.

National data from the CDC also reflect that finding, suggesting that newer variants, including BQ.1.1, are displacing BA.5 without a corresponding increase in infections, Kuritzkes said. "There's been more of a churn than a real upswing." But he and others expect that will change as cold weather and the holidays lead to more people congregating indoors.

Dr Jeremy Luban, a professor and virus researcher at UMass Chan Medical School, sees indications that BQ.1.1 will be more transmissible. "That means if you go into a crowded bar, you're more likely to come out with the virus than if it were a previous variant and infect more people yourself," he said.

"It could cause another wave," Luban added, but he softened that unwanted forecast with the prediction that things might not be as bad this time around. "It's unlikely that it will cause our hospitals to fill up the way it did before," he said.

Indeed, as we near the close of the 3rd year of the pandemic, many scientists say that immunity to the virus is greater than ever before and doubt that new offshoots of omicron will cause as many hospitalizations and deaths as prior ones. Even though antibodies against BQ.1.1 may be low, another arm of the immune system composed of T cells can still help prevent many mild infections from becoming severe ones.

"The huge majority of vaccinated people have no particular reason to be anxious about BQ.1.1," Hanage said.

Pills such as Paxlovid, which hinder viral replication, are still expected to work against the new variants, whose most worrying mutations lie in the spike protein the virus uses to cause infection. COVID vaccines trigger the immune system to make antibodies that block the spike, but the more the virus evolves, there are fewer antibodies that still recognize the spike and prevent infection.

Throughout the pandemic, several labs have worked to figure out how well our antibodies hold up against emerging variants. The preliminary findings for BQ.1.1, published by several groups this month [November 2022], are not encouraging.

One study led by Dr Dan Barouch, director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, found that people who recently received the updated booster shot had about sevenfold lower antibody levels to BQ.1.1 compared with BA.5. "That suggests BQ.1.1 will be a challenge for vaccines as well as for natural immunity," Barouch said.

Two other studies from the Emory Vaccine Center and the University of Texas Medical Branch found that BQ.1.1 antibodies were about 4 to 6 times lower than BA.5 antibodies in people who got updated boosters. BQ.1.1 antibodies were even lower and sometimes undetectable in people with just 1 or 2 shots of the original booster.

"That is concerning," said Pei-Yong Shi, director of the Sealy Institute for Drug Discovery at the University of Texas Medical Branch. He believes his study suggests the new boosters are better, even though he says the BQ.1.1 antibody levels are "not very robust."

Luban said that although these antibody studies report similar data, the conclusions that scientists are drawing from them lean toward a glass half-full or half-empty scenario. While some emphasize the new boosters raise antibodies to BQ.1.1, others highlight those antibodies are still lower than scientists prefer, he said.

Vaccine makers are reporting results from their own studies on BQ.1.1 through an optimistic lens. A preprint published last week [week of 14 Nov 2022] from scientists at Pfizer, BioNTech, and Shi's lab showed that the new booster raised BQ.1.1 antibodies 4.8-fold, a fact touted in the firms' statement. The statement didn't note that the antibodies were still lower to that variant than BA.5 or to the original virus.

Cambridge-based Moderna said in a statement its new booster spurred a "robust" antibody response against BQ.1.1 without providing data.

Antibody immunity from the mRNA vaccines made by Pfizer and Moderna wanes quickly, and with BQ.1.1 antibodies low to begin with, scientists anticipate that breakthrough infections may be common.

[3] China: cases hit record as dissent grows over tough restrictions
Date: Thu 24 Nov 2022 9:51 AM EST

https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/24/asia/china-covid-highest-daily-case-number-intl-hnk/index.html


China on Thursday [24 Nov 2022] reported a record number of daily COVID infections, as a nationwide surge in cases heaps pressure on the country's increasingly unpopular zero-tolerance approach to the virus.

The National Health Commission (NHC) recorded 31 444 locally transmitted cases on Wednesday [23 Nov 2022] -- surpassing the previous peak of 29 317 recorded 13 Apr [2022] during Shanghai's months-long lockdown.

The surge is being fueled by outbreaks in multiple cities and comes despite a refusal by authorities to end tight infection controls even in the face of an increasing -- and unprecedented -- backlash against their hardline approach of incessant lockdowns, quarantines, and mass testing mandates.

Meanwhile, a trickle of COVID-related fatalities has added further pressure to the mix. Beijing on Wednesday [23 Nov 2022] recorded its 4th COVID-related death since last weekend [18-19 Nov 2022], alongside 1648 local infections -- its 3rd consecutive day of more than 1000 local cases.

On Thursday [24 Nov 2022], city officials said they were converting a major exhibition center into a makeshift hospital for the quarantine and treatment of COVID patients.

That was just the latest sign of the capital ratcheting up COVID controls. Earlier this week, schools in several districts moved classes online while Chaoyang -- epicenter of the city's outbreak and home to many international businesses and embassies -- urged residents to stay at home and shuttered restaurants, gyms, and beauty salons.

Growing dissent
---------------
China, the world's last major economy still enforcing strict zero-COVID measures, announced a limited easing of the policy earlier this month [November 2022] in what some observers saw as a sign of the government acknowledging its shortfalls.

It discouraged unnecessary mass testing and overly zealous classification of restricted "high-risk" areas, scrapped quarantine requirements for secondary close contacts, and reduced quarantine for close contacts and international arrivals.

Following the announcement, several Chinese cities canceled mass COVID tests, but there remains a dizzying array of restrictions for residents to navigate -- especially when outbreaks occur.

Signs that people have had enough are becoming increasingly dramatic and rare protests have broken out in a country where authorities traditionally clamp down on any signs of dissent.

Protests erupted this week at the world's biggest iPhone assembly factory, in the city of Zhengzhou. Videos on social media showed workers confronting riot police after authorities attempted to lock down the facility following an outbreak. It comes a week after some residents in the southern manufacturing hub of Guangzhou revolted against an extended lockdown by tearing down barriers and marching down streets.

Fueling the anger of citizens trapped in lockdowns are recurring issues like being unable to access prompt medical care or secure enough food and supplies, or lose work and income.

Hong Kong's health authorities on Thursday [24 Nov 2022] reported 9219 new coronavirus infections and 13 related deaths.

In a sudden jump after hovering around 8000 cases over the last few days, the total number of cases exceeded the 9000 mark, the most in more than 2 months.

Of the new cases, 8500 were locally transmitted and the rest imported, according to the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health.

Among the imported infections, 381 were identified at the Hong Kong International Airport, 262 from days 1 to 3 of their arrival, and the remaining 76 during days 4-7.

As of Thursday [24 Nov 2022], the Public Health Laboratory Services Branch (PHLSB) identified 224 cases of sub-lineage XBB, 6 of XBD, 8 of BA.2.75.2, 7 of BA.4.6, 12 of BF.7, and 34 of BQ.1.1 among the imported cases.

72 cases of sub-lineage XBB, 16 of XBD, 1 of BA.2.75.2, 2 of BF.7, and 78 of BQ.1.1 were also detected among the local cases.

Among the specimens received by the PHLSB from 15 to 21 Nov 2022 for verification testing of local cases, 77.1 percent of them (7-day moving average) were related to the BA.4 or BA.5 (including suspected cases) subvariant, said the CHP.

So far, 10= 434 COVID patients have passed away in the city during the 5th wave, or 10 647 since the pandemic started here, the CHP added.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/25/australias-fourth-covid-wave-likely-to-peak-before-christmas-experts-say


Australia's 4th COVID wave is likely to peak before Christmas as the rate of hospitalisations and infections begin to slow.

Cases have continued to increase nationwide for the 6th consecutive week, however at a slower rate. This suggests a plateau in cases would arrive by the 1st week of December [2022], in line with pandemic modelling, if it has not already.

New South Wales [NSW] recorded 31 531 new COVID cases in the weekly reporting period, a 13% increase from last week's 27 869.

Victoria recorded 22 281 new cases in the latest weekly reporting period, a 9% increase on the previous week's 20 398.

Previously, cases in NSW and Victoria were doubling in just a fortnight, driven by a "soup" of omicron subvariants.

Deaths in NSW fell to 25, compared with 39 the previous week. Of the state's deaths, 16 people were aged care residents, 14 of which died in an aged care facility.

There were 1320 people being treated in hospital with the virus and 32 in intensive care, as the seven-day rolling average of daily admissions decreased to 73, compared with 75 the previous week.

Emergency department presentations, however, had risen to 314 from 262 in the last reporting period.

James Wood, an associate professor of epidemiological modelling of infectious diseases at the University of New South Wales Sydney, said cases were "very close" to the peak in NSW if it had not already occurred.

"I suspect they will remain around the current level for the next week or 2 and then decline," he said.

"I definitely expect cases to be markedly lower by Christmas. It looks like the new omicron subvariants are already pretty close to dominant and that rising immunity from infections and reduced transmission as we move into summer will be what pushes cases down."

In Victoria, there were 68 deaths recorded in the past 7 days -- up from 46 in the previous week. Health authorities said deaths may not have occurred in the week they were formally reported.

Hospitalisations increased by 22% to an average of 430 a day, and there were 15 daily ICU admissions, almost double the previous week's 8.

Victoria's chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said hospitalisations and case numbers were expected to increase for several weeks with a likely peak forecast around early December [2022].

"Indications from Singapore and western Europe suggest this wave may pass relatively quickly, although differing local conditions may have an impact," Sutton said.

The state's latest wastewater testing results found a strong detection of SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus that causes COVID -- in every geographical area, and a "very strong" detection in Craigieburn and Portland.

Similarly, all tested samples in NSW contained fragments of SARS-CoV-2, with a particular increase in Quakers Hill in western Sydney.

Queensland recorded 10 082 new cases in the latest reporting period and 14 deaths, a decrease on the 10 106 cases and 15 deaths reported the previous week.

Hospitalisations, however, had increased by 27%. There were 312 people being treated in hospital with COVID and 8 in ICU, compared with 245 admissions and 5 in intensive care the previous week.

Catherine Bennett, chair in epidemiology at Deakin University said it was clear cases were "starting to taper" nationwide and had already flattened out in Tasmania, Queensland, Western Australia, and South Australia.

"I'd describe it as a plateau than a sharp peak," she said. "The coming down is less certain, we're still learning about a mix of viruses and you're still at a 50% higher likelihood of acquiring the virus compared to the start of the month.

"But hopefully it's at the highest it'll be and it'll be a more normal Christmas this year [2022]."

The latest wave was now made up of a mix of omicron sub-lineages, including BR.2 and BQ.1.1.

There were 11 separate variants of COVID-19 circulating in NSW, including 3 "recombinant" variants. A new BA.2.75/BA.5 recombinant, XBF, made up more than 10% of sequenced cases in Victoria.

Bennett said the COVID variants were currently reproducing at a rate of 1.1, "barely a replacement" due to hybrid immunity, recent infection and vaccination rates.

She said the relatively low number of hospitalisations and ICU admissions to the virus compared with previous waves was also cause for optimism.

"Early predictions were the outbreak would behave in a similar way to waves overseas, and that looks to be the case," she said.

"If we don't see hospitalisations rise and an impact on the daily death rate that's the most important thing ... and aged care outbreaks will be one to watch."

A spokesperson from the federal health department said cases had increased by 11% nationwide in the week ending 22 Nov 2022, while hospitalisations rose by 14%.

They said while there was usually a lag in hospitalisations which may increase after case numbers declined, numbers remained "well below" the earlier winter peak.
