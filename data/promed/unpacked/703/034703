Three more imported cases of dengue fever -- one each contracted in the
Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia -- were reported recently, according to
statistics from the Taiwan Department of Health (DOH) released yesterday.
The number of people in Taiwan who have contracted the disease overseas has
increased to 48 compared with only 20 imported cases during the same period
last year.
Hsu Kuo-hsiung, acting director of the DOH's Bureau of Communicable Disease
Control, urged people traveling to Southeast Asian areas such as Singapore,
Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaysia, Burma, Cambodia and Laos to beware
of dengue fever, the infectious disease carried by mosquitoes in tropical
climates. Doctors observing patients with unidentified fever, rashes or
muscle and bone pain should report their findings to local health
authorities immediately, Hsu said.
