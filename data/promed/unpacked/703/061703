Coca-Cola Korea Bottling Company is under fire over its attempt to hide a
recent poisoning incident involving its soft drinks from Korean consumers.
Police in Kwangju last Mon, 10 Jul 2006, said a woman was arrested on
charges of sending blackmail text messages to the cell phones of Coca-Cola
Korea officials and posting articles on the company's Web site from 1-9 Jul
2006. The woman threatened to inject Coca-Cola drinks with poison if the
company did not pay up 2 billion won [slightly more than 1 million US
dollars - Mod.LL].
After drinking a bottle of coke in a restaurant, a 25-year-old man fell
seriously ill and was taken to a nearby hospital on Mon, 10 Jul 2006. He
was later moved to a larger hospital in Seoul for treatment.
The company had been carrying on crisis management by swiftly exchanging
products at convenience stores in South and North Cholla Provinces where
Coke officials believed poisoned drink products could be during the period
of the blackmail, a Coca-Cola Korea official explained. But they did it in
a quiet manner without a single sign of warning to the consumers.
The company was actively cooperating with the police investigation, which
was not opened to the public, the official claimed. Thus, all it could do
was act upon it without causing a commotion while waiting for the police
results. Some owners at a convenience store said the company did not tell
them the reason for the exchange, while others said the company told them
it was collecting the products due to mold on the caps of bottles.
After the incident, the Coke company publicly began recalling thousands of
bottles in market circulation in the Cholla region on 11 Jul 2006, the day
after the woman was caught. And Coca-Cola said that it would not distribute
the drink until the incident settled down.

Coca-Cola has recalled 40 000 cases of soft drinks in South Korea and
claimed it was the victim of a blackmail campaign, after a consumer was
allegedly poisoned by drinking a bottle of Coke.
Police told the firm that tests on 3 bottles of Coke indicated the drinks
were to blame for the poisoning, which had reportedly left one person in a
coma on Tue, 12 Jul 2006.
Coca-Cola Amatil, in charge of group operations in South Korea, said it had
been "the subject of an extortion threat affecting Coca-Cola in PET
packages". The group has recalled all Coca-Cola, diet Coke and Coke Zero
drinks in PET packaging from the country's Kwangju, Hwasoon and Damyang
regions.
It is Coca-Cola's 2nd large-scale recall in the southeast Asia region in
the last 3 months. The group withdrew around 2.4 million bottles in Japan
this May 2006, including flasghip brands Coke and Fanta, amid concerns that
iron powder had leaked into drinks at one of its Japanese factories.
The firm said the South Korean recall was a "precautionary measure" taken
following police advice, and planned to have Coke back on shelves in PET
packages within 7 days.

Police in Gwangju on Tue, 11 Jul 2006 applied for an arrest warrant for a
woman who poisoned Coca Cola bottles in an attempt to blackmail the soft
drink maker's bottling plant here. The 41-year-old injected herbicide into
several bottles at a local store, making a man in his 20s who drank one
seriously ill.
The woman placed 3 poisoned bottles of coke in a supermarket in Hwaseon and
a restaurant in Damyang, South Cholla Province on 8 Jul 2006. The victim,
who drank one of them, came down with acute cardiac failure and remains in
critical condition.

[The herbicide allegedly used in this episode is not specified. Acute
toxicity with trivalent arsenic generally manifests with the cholera-like
gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting (often bloody) and severe diarrhea
(which may be rice-watery in character and often bloody); these patients
will experience acute distress, dehydration (often), and hypovolemic shock.
Multiple reports of cardiac arrhythmias exist in the literature. Reports of
prolongation of the QT and ventricular fibrillation after acute arsenic
intoxication make careful attention to cardiac status imperative. These
patients usually have a garlic-like odor to their breath and body fluids.
2, 4 D (2,4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), another herbicide, may also have
effects on cardiac rhythm.
