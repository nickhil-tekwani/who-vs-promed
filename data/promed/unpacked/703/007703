Health officials in Karachi, Pakistan are reporting another _Naegleria fowleri_ case in the city, the 7th of the year to date, in a 38-year-old man of North Karachi.

He was admitted to the Ziauddin Hospital and is in the ICU after being denied treatment at 2 other hospitals.

According to a report prepared by the Regional Disease Surveillance and Response Unit, the risk factor in this case was piped water.

"There is an urgent need to assess the process of chlorination and level of chlorine at all major water reservoirs supplying water to the city as per the WHO recommendation. Cleanliness must be maintained at all reservoirs, overhead tanks/other reservoirs of households, pumping stations and hydrants on a regular basis," the report says.

_Naegleria fowleri_ causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) which is almost always fatal. _Naegleria fowleri_ is waterborne, and its infections are usually associated with aquatic activities but it can also be transmitted via the domestic water supply. An increasing number of _N. fowleri_ cases have been reported from Pakistan.

The first case of _N. fowleri_ was reported from Karachi, Pakistan, in 2008. Since 2014, there have been more than 50 cases reported in Karachi alone.

[_Naegleria fowleri_ can be found in piped water. A study from the U.S. found that if a free chlorine concentration of > 1.0 mg/L was attained for 60 days _N. fowleri_ was not detected in water samples (Cope JR et al. Response and remediation actions following the detection of _Naegleria fowleri_ in two treated drinking water distribution systems, Louisiana, 2013-2014. J Water Health. 2019 Oct;17(5):777-787. DOI: https://doi.org/10.2166/wh.2019.239).

The common hypothesis for infection with _N. fowleri_ is that it is penetrating the cribriform plate which is part of the ethmoid bone. The cribriform plate is perforated by olfactory foramina for the passage of the olfactory nerves, and it is generally believed that _N. fowleri_ enter the brain through these perforations of the cribriform plate.

In the ProMED posting from 24 Aug 2014, we pointed to the religious rite of ablution included in Yogic, Ayurvedic, and Islamic traditions. Within the Islamic faith, ritual nasal rinsing is included in a cleansing process called wudu, or ablution. It is usually performed several times a day in preparation for prayer, according to the CDC. The parasite has also been contracted via the use of neti pots. These practices where water is introduced into the sinuses is an obvious route of infection with _Naegleria fowleri_.

If this is how the cases in Pakistan are infected, it can be prevented by using boiled water for ablution. - Mod.EP
