The mystery behind the deaths of some turkeys in the Mountain Road area [Thunder Bay] seems to have been solved with the help of a wildlife pathologist.

After a handful of turkeys suddenly died, some neighbours in the area were concerned the birds were poisoned.

But a Guelph pathologist with the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre who looked at the dead birds said the turkeys had [avian cholera, a bacterial infection]. "We have very rarely seen infections with this bacterium in wild birds here in Ontario," Doug Campbell said. "You know, I've probably seen a handful of cases." The bacteria can be spread to other birds, or introduced by a bite from another animal, such as a cat.

The Ministry of Natural Resources said the likely reason the birds had the bacteria was because they were once in captivity. It's illegal to keep wild turkeys without a permit, a ministry spokesperson said. "Raised birds may introduce diseases into the wild birds and compete with wild birds for resources, or interbreed with wild birds," Michelle Nowak said. "Wild turkeys cannot be kept in captivity or released without authorization of the Ministry of Natural Resources."

She noted the type of turkey that died isn't found in the wild in this region.

Avian cholera is not a health hazard for humans. Campbell said the bacteria is rarely found in Ontario, and that it's more prevalent at poultry farms and in waterfowl.

This article does not tell us the subspecies of _Pasteurella multocida_ that was found in the turkeys.

Avian cholera is caused by _Pasteurella multocida_. There are several types or strains. The most common type affecting wild birds is type 1. In the wild, it affects primarily ducks, coots, geese, gulls, and crows. The causative agent is contained in feces and other body secretions. Ingestion of food or water contaminated with any infected body secretions will spread the disease. Transmission by aerosol may occur, and the bacteria can survive up to 4 months in the soil.

If illness is observed, the birds will be lethargic, or they may have convulsions, swim or fly erratically or in circles, or they may appear to try to fly upside down. Illness is not often observed, as the onset is so acute. Fecal droppings range from pale yellow to bloody.

Avian cholera (also sometimes called fowl cholera) is a disease to be differentiated from avian influenza. But lesions and testing can demonstrate that difference. Avian cholera, caused by _Pasteurella multocida_, is not to be confused with the cholera that affects humans, caused by the bacterium _Vibrio cholerae_. Fowl cholera or avian cholera is not zoonotic and has no public health significance.

Death is usually rapid; lethargy and convulsions may occur in sick birds that do not die acutely.

Generally, clean up of carcasses will help prevent contamination of the environment. - Mod.TG]
