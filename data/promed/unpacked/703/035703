Ebola survivors on the increase
-------------------------------
Government has confirmed that the driver from Mambolo in Kambia [district, Northern province, Sierra Leone], who tested positive for Ebola virus disease (EVD), has yesterday [11 Jun 2014] been discharged from the Kenema Government Hospital after treatment which saw his viral load reduced to negative tests for many days. Also, it now appears that his wife had never tested positive for Ebola but had merely accompanied her husband to Kenema when his tests initially showed positive.

Health Ministry spokesman Sidie Yahya Tunis confirmed to this paper that the driver has survived. Also, apparently, it was an error on the part of the ministry to have stated in 10 Jun 2014 update that 2 out of the 16 dead Ebola patients were from Kambia. Tunis said no deaths had occurred so far in Kambia. Tunis urged that early reporting of suspected EVD cases increases chances of survival.

According to him, they are now putting robust action in place to contain the disease. He said the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has provided support for them to recruit community volunteers who will be trained to tour various communities and search for contacts.

Meanwhile, reports monitored from Daru in Jawei chiefdom of Kailahun district [Eastern province] are that the husband of the late Nurse MK, has suddenly appeared in the town from apparent hiding. He is reported to be alive but very weak and emaciated from almost 2 weeks in hiding. He confessed that he went into hiding when he was informed that his wife had died from suspected Ebola and he realized that all the medical persons who treated his wife, plus all the women who washed her corpse, had died. The Imam who prayed over her corpse has also died. Mr SK is alleged to have feared he also had EVD and hid to avoid being taken to Kenema hospital. When he was not seen for 2 weeks, it was assumed he had also died and he got recorded as dead. Reports are that on his arrival in Daru yesterday [11 Jun 2014], he received medical care and blood samples have been taken from him for testing.

[According to the Tulane group in Kenema, this is totally wrong -- the husband had been undergoing treatment in the hospital the whole time and has just been discharged. - Mod.JW]

[Dr Robert Garry of the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (VHFC) wishes to correct the comment on ProMED-mail from a "reliable" source that the Harvard VHFC is running experimental antigen assays with a high false NEGATIVE rate with the result that case and contacts are being missed. He says this is incorrect. He is having trouble with his internet connection from Sierra Leone, so I expect further details tomorrow. - Mod.JW
