One of P.E.I.'s (Prince Edward Island) most successful harness racing drivers has posted on Facebook one of his yearlings has tested positive for strangles. Strangles is a highly contagious upper respiratory illness causing swollen lymph nodes and fevers in horses, donkeys and mules. While the illness can be fatal, most horses survive.

Marc Campbell made the social media post on [Fri 6 Nov 2020], saying that because one of his horses was diagnosed with the illness, he was forced to withdraw his other horses from racing this week, including a stake race in Truro, N.S. (Nova Scotia).

He says on Facebook his barn will be quarantined until his vet says it's safe. "I think we caught it in time," Campbell said through messenger.

Campbell has horses belonging to other owners at his stable and in his post he said he has been following all instructions in order to prevent the spread of the disease. "The infected animal will be taken to an isolated farm until she is cleared of the infection and your horses will continue to be cared for," he said in the post.

Officials with P.E.I. Harness Racing Industry Association said they are aware of the situation, but didn't offer further comment.

Officials with Red Shores Racetrack and Casino in Charlottetown said they are also aware of the situation and believe it is under control -- they didn't offer further comment.

The track has offered Campbell his own hours to jog the horses in his care to limit any contact with other animals, he said in his post.

["Strangles is caused by bacterial infection with _Streptococcus equi_ subspecies _equi_ (referred to as _S. equi_). The bacteria typically infect the upper airway and lymph nodes of the head and neck. The disease has been in the equine population for centuries and was 1st reported in 1251. The infection is highly contagious in horse populations, particularly affecting young horses, and can recur on farms with previous outbreaks of the disease. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed contagious diseases of the horse worldwide. The persistence of this infection on farms is multifactorial. The bacteria can survive in water sources for over a month, but the primary source of recurrent infections is most likely asymptomatic carrier horses that can shed the bacteria to other horses for months to years.

Clinical signs of disease
-------------------------
"Historically, strangles got its name as affected horses were sometimes suffocated from large, infected lymph nodes that obstructed their upper airway or trachea. The hallmark clinical signs of infection are fever (temperature higher than 101.5 deg. F / 38.6 deg. C), nasal discharge, and enlarged submandibular lymph nodes (in the space between the lower jawbones), which ultimately abscess. Purulent nasal discharge is typically present, although it may initially be clear. The retropharyngeal lymph nodes (located deep behind the throatlatch) may also become enlarged and abscess. These will sometimes drain into the guttural pouches, which are air-filled spaces within the head that are an expansion of the eustachian tubes. Guttural pouch infection and pus accumulation (empyema) are often the result of retropharyngeal lymph nodes that abscess and rupture into the guttural pouches. Guttural pouch infection may also occur from bacterial entrance through the pharynx (throat). Anorexia, depression, and difficulty swallowing may also accompany signs of infection.

"Though strangles is highly contagious and can affect many horses on a farm, most horses with infection recover without complication. Complications from the infection include spread of the infection to lymph nodes other than the head and neck (also known as metastatic infection or bastard strangles), immune-mediated disease (such as purpura hemorrhagica), muscle disease, and pain and lack of milk production. Horses that develop complicated infection typically require antibiotic and additional therapies based on veterinary examination.

Transmission
------------
"Nasal discharge from the infected horse is the largest source of contamination. Sources of infection can be nose-to-nose contact with an infected horse; sharing contaminated water buckets, feed tubs, twitches, tack, and clothing; and equipment of handlers who work with infected horses.

"Once the horse comes into contact with a potential source of infection, it may take 3-14 days after exposure before the horse will show the 1st clinical sign of strangles (fever). Based on this information, a minimum isolation period for introduction of new horses to the farm should be 14 days.

Diagnosis
---------
"Clinical signs of strangles are highly suggestive of the diagnosis. There are 3 methods to confirm the diagnosis of strangles:
- Culture of the bacteria from the nasal discharge or abscess;
- Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that detects DNA of the _S. equi_ bacteria;
- Blood test (serology) that measures a titer to a specific protein (SeM) of _S. equi_.

"PCR is a very sensitive test that detects bacterial DNA. PCR cannot tell the difference between live and dead bacteria, so it is typically used in conjunction with culture. However, if consecutive PCRs are negative, the horse is unlikely to have strangles. Anywhere from 4% to 50% of the horses on farms with recurring strangles are asymptomatic carriers of the infection. Most horses will begin shedding (bacteria can be transmitted from nasal secretions to other horses) the bacteria from their nasal passages a couple of days after the onset of fever. Bacterial shedding occurs intermittently for several weeks. Some horses may continue to shed the bacteria for months to even years, serving a continual source of new infections on the farm. All diagnostic tests and treatment of affected cases should be done under veterinary supervision.

Treatment
---------
"Antibiotic therapy remains controversial for the treatment of strangles. Complicated cases and those requiring tracheostomy for management of respiratory distress generally do require antibiotic and other supportive therapies. There is some evidence that treatment with antibiotics (such as penicillin) at the 1st sign of fever and in horses with no lymph node enlargement may prevent infection. However, early antibiotic treatment will also prevent these cases from developing immunity to the infection and subsequently makes them susceptible to reinfection sooner.

Management of an outbreak
-------------------------
"The first and most important thing to remember in a suspected outbreak of strangles is to involve your veterinarian right away to determine the diagnosis and the best control practices for your particular farm. Strangles is a reportable disease in some states, and the state veterinarian may need to be notified as well. Movement of any horses on or off the farm should be stopped, and new horses should not be introduced. Take the temperature of all horses on the farm twice daily. Normal rectal temperature is 99-101.5 F (37.2-38.6 C). Monitoring the rectal temperature and isolating horses at the 1st sign of fever is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of infection. Infected horses can transmit the bacteria to healthy horses 1-2 days after they develop a fever.

"An isolated area should be set up for horses with fever and any other signs of illness (for example, nasal discharge). Extreme care should be taken not to mix horses with infection and horses exposed to horses with strangles to unexposed horses.

"Ideally, 3 groups of horses should be created:
- infected horses;
- horses that have been exposed to or contacted infected horses; and
- clean horses with no exposure.

"Unexposed horses should be kept in a "clean" area and ideally should have separate caretakers, cleaning equipment, grooming equipment, water troughs, and pasture. People and equipment can transfer the infection from horse to horse. Extreme care, handwashing, and disinfection of supplies must be observed by everyone involved. If different individuals cannot care for infected and healthy horses, then healthy horses should always be dealt with 1st.

- Dedicated protective clothing such as boots, gowns or coveralls, and gloves should be utilized when dealing with infected horses;
- Work with infected horses last if the same personnel cares for the entire farm;
- Use dedicated equipment for infected horses (pitchforks, rakes, tack, etc.);
- Thoroughly disinfect equipment between horses (read the label instructions on disinfectants to be sure they are used at the correct dilution and are active against _S. equi_);
- To disinfect stables and vans, remove all manure and debris first. Soak all surfaces with liquid disinfectant or steam treat the area and allow to dry;
- Disinfect water troughs daily that are used by infected horses;
- There is no evidence that _S. equi_ can survive for long periods on pasture;
- Pastures used to house infected horses should be rested for 4 weeks;
- Manure and waste feed from infected horses should be composted in an isolated location and not spread on the pastures.

"A serious challenge when dealing with an outbreak of strangles is identifying the horses that are carriers of the bacteria but are not showing any signs of illness. Ideally, all horses on the farm should be tested for strangles. Use of the bacterial culture and PCR combined identifies carriers with a 90% success rate. Nasal pharyngeal swabs or washes can be done to sample the horses for infection. The washes improve the chance of identifying carrier horses. Additionally, all sick horses should be tested 3 consecutive times and be negative all 3 times before being put back with healthy horses. Previously infected horses can shed the bacteria for weeks to months, or even years in rare cases, which is why 3 negative test samples are recommended prior to reintroduction to the healthy herd. For the most accurate diagnosis of carriers and horses without obvious clinical signs, upper airway and guttural pouch endoscopy can be performed. This procedure allows for identification of infections that can develop in the guttural pouch, and culture of that area. Although disinfection, isolation procedures, and diagnosis can be costly, they are certainly cheaper than additional outbreaks on your farm.

Vaccination
-----------
"Vaccination is one method for prevention and control of infection with _S. equi_. However, vaccination cannot guarantee disease prevention. With strangles, vaccination will likely reduce the severity of disease in the majority of horses that are infected. Available vaccines can be administered by intramuscular and intranasal routes. Improper administration of the vaccination can result in poor protection against infection and/or complications at the site of injection; therefore, administration by your veterinarian is recommended. The intranasal vaccination results in the best local immunity.

"Vaccination is generally not recommended during an outbreak of strangles. If there are horses on the farm with no clinical signs of infection (fever, nasal discharge) and no known contact with sick horses, vaccination may be considered. Horses that have had the disease within the previous year also do not need to be vaccinated. Once recovered from an active infection, 75% of horses have immunity for 1-2 years. Vaccination of horses recently exposed to strangles (that have high antibody levels) may result in purpura hemorrhagica. Purpura hemorrhagica is caused by an overactive immune response within the horse, which can result in limb swelling, swelling of the head, and small hemorrhages on the gums. Vaccination is recommended only in healthy horses with no fever or nasal discharge.

"Should I vaccinate my horse? The answer to that question depends on your horse's chance of exposure to infection, and your personal comfort with the level of risk and in conjunction with your veterinarian. Generally, if your horse travels routinely and is exposed to varied or new populations of horses regularly, vaccination should be considered. Broodmares on farms with a history of strangles should be vaccinated prior to foaling. The initial vaccination requires a booster dose before being effective against infection. It takes about one month from vaccination for immunity to develop. Therefore, be certain to vaccinate your horse in advance of transport or potential exposure to new horses.

Additional preventative measures
--------------------------------
"Here are some additional suggestions for reducing your horse and your farm's risk for infection:
- require a current health certificate for new horse arrivals on the farm;
- ask owners of new horses about a history of strangles and consider testing new horses to see if they are shedding the bacteria;
- if feasible, quarantine new arrivals for 2-3 weeks and monitor their temperature;
- all horses should have individual water buckets that are routinely disinfected;
- if shared water troughs are utilized, they should be routinely disinfected;
- when traveling to shows, minimize your horse's exposure by bringing your own feed, buckets, and equipment. Minimize use of shared stalls or pastures at showgrounds;
- if horses are pastured together, group them according to their age and risk level (e.g., all weanlings together, all broodmares together).

"Reducing your horse's exposure to unknown horses and utilizing routine disinfection measures will decrease the chance of infection with strangles. If your farm does have an outbreak, isolation and containment of sick horses will help reduce the spread of infection. The American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) has developed strangles control guidelines and can be downloaded at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jvim.15043 with detailed recommendations for treatment, control, and prevention of infection.
