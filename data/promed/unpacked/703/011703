Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) in Uganda - WHO Update 3
-------------------------------------------------------
As of Thu 19 Oct 2000, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported 111
cases, including 41 deaths.
On Mon 16 Oct 2000, the WHO Collaborating Centre, the National Institute for
Virology, South Africa confirmed the first cases of Ebola reported in
Uganda, in Gulu district. A rapid response team from WHO Headquarters was
dispatched on Monday afternoon to support the WHO Office in Uganda and the
Ugandan Ministry of Health. The team left with over 600 kg of protective
equipment, including disposable masks, gloves and gowns. This equipment is
adequate to meet the needs of the initial phase of the response. WHO has
sent an additional 1370 kg of protective equipment which will arrive in the
next 2days.
The WHO team in Gulu has reported that the isolation units in Lacor St.
Mary's and Gulu General Hospitals are clean, well organized and well
supplied. Cases are being managed effectively. The units are being
strengthened by personnel from WHO, WHO Collaborating Centre at the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) United States, Istituto
Superiore di Sanita (ISS) Italy and Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF)
International.
Investigations to determine the distribution of Ebola haemorrhagic fever
cases in the region are intensifying. On 18 Oct 2000, WHO staff travelled to
Kitgum to investigate reports that cases were occurring in this city and
found no evidence of current disease activity. Epidemiologists from WHO, CDC
and Epicentre, France are supporting the Ministry of Health in the
investigation. The case definition for the disease is being improved so as
to ensure accurate case finding and contact tracing.

Ebola hemorrhagic fever: treatment protocols
---------------------------------------------
[A communication from Terry Fredeking, President of Antibody Systems, Inc.
Hurst, Texas, USA. Antibody Systems Inc. of Hurst, TX, USA, has given
grants to a Russian Institute in Siberia for the study of Ebola hemorrhagic
fever treatment protocols. VECTOR, a P4 lab in Siberia, has carried out
work in animal models from our grants for 3 years. One of the most
interesting studies was the effects of Ebola and Marburg [viruses on the
cytokine activity of Interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
which rise rapidly by day 3 of infection and are responsible for setting up
[disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC sometime between day 8 and day
12. Our research has evaluated many different medications and we have
concluded that certain drugs could stimulate receptors against these 2
cytokines. The most interesting drug that stimulated receptors was
tetracycline, a common and inexpensive antibiotic. I am not suggesting that
tetracycline has any [direct effect on the virus; but experiment after
experiment has shown that this drug stimulates soluble receptors against
these 2 cytokines that are elevated during a hemorrhagic virus infection.
In our experiments, dosage played an important role [in the survival of
our animal models.
We also evaluated doxycycline, which may be more readily available for use
in Uganda. While the effect of doxycycline was almost as impressive,
tetracycline was about 15% better at eliciting this receptor response. Since
both tetracycline and doxycycline are already approved drugs, well
tolerated, and inexpensive, I hope that [someone will consider our data in
the treatment of the patients in the Ebola epidemic in Uganda. Certainly, it
would not have any known contra-indications that would effect the outcome of
patients in a negative way, and it is highly probable that it would affect
the patient in a positive way. We [are prepared to make our data available
[to anyone who may be interested.
