Confirming that 264 cases of Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), popularly known as monkey fever, have been found so far in Sattari taluka [sub district, Goa], Dr Utkarsh Betodkar, an epidemiologist in the directorate of health services, told this daily that around 5030 villagers have been vaccinated against the disease, which includes a 2nd dose for some villagers.

He said that the directorate of health services had placed an order for 4500 vaccines and so far, it has succeeded in administering the vaccine to a sizeable population in the affected villages.

The directorate of health services anticipates that the disease would be under control during the next few months as the cashew harvesting season is nearing an end. However, Dr Betodkar did not rule out the possibility of more KFD cases in the next year.

So far, 3 deaths have been registered due to the infection, this year [2016].
