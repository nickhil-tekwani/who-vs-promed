The bird flu virus has already developed signs of resistance to
oseltamivir, the drug widely used to treat the disease's symptoms in
humans, a research study has found. Yong Poovorawan, who headed a group of
researchers, said his team learned of the resistance which was reflected in
[replacement?] of amino acids in the [viral neuraminidase?]. It was the
first scientific study that could pinpoint such changes -- a result of
genetic [change] of avian flu [virus] -- and its resistance to oseltamivir.
The study would [will?] soon be published in the Emerging Infectious
Diseases Journal and Journal of Virological Methods. "This study will
enable medical science and health personnel to precisely diagnose bird
flu-like symptoms among patients for immediate, appropriate treatment," he
said.
Avian flu resistance to oseltamivir had been confirmed in 4 bird flu
patients in Viet Nam, 3 of whom died in 2005. The Viet Nam cases showed the
possibility that oseltamivir might be less effective than anticipated,
particularly as resistant strains of bird flu become more prevalent. A
previous study in Japan also found a genetic [change] in the H3N2 flu
strain in 18 per cent of patients who took oseltamivir, he said.
Dr Yong, a virologist at Chulalongkorn University's faculty of medicine,
earlier warned the Public Health Ministry and the hospitals run by the
Bangkok Metropolitan Administration to exercise caution when prescribing
oseltamivir in patients with influenza and bird flu-like symptoms, saying
continuous and frequent use of the [drug] without precise diagnoses was
likely to trigger viral resistance. During bird flu outbreaks, health
personnel treated people with flu and bird flu-like symptoms with
oseltamivir, even if they had not been in contact with poultry.
Disease Control Department director-general Thawat Sundarachan agreed that
the anti-viral drug made it harder for doctors and epidemiologists to
identify the virus due to the absence of related bird flu symptoms, citing
the latest death case in Nong Bua Lam Phu province. Several laboratory
tests had to be conducted before the death was confirmed as the country's
17th bird flu fatality [see ProMED-mail post entitled "Avian influenza,
human (155): Thailand, Indonesia 20060927.2757"].
But Dr Thawat insisted only patients with records of touching or eating
chickens that had died mysteriously would be treated with oseltamivir. He
believed that the [drug] was still the best defence against the lethal H5N1
strain of bird flu and other types of human flu. The closely-related
zanamivir drug was also effective, but since the drug had to be inhaled, it
was almost impossible for patients with severe lung damage to use it, he said.

[This vague report of detection of oseltamivir resistance in Thailand
implies that specific genetic changes have been identified that have
conferred oseltamivir resistance and provided information useful in the
treatment of patients. Instances of oseltamivir resistance in patients have
been reported previously, but there has been no unequivocal confirmation of
transmission of resistant virus from person to person.
Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) inhibit the activity of the
viral neuraminidase, an enzyme that enables influenza virus to escape from
an infected cell and spread to other cells. Several studies suggest that
viral resistance to oseltamivir may be a greater problem than previously
believed. For example, in epidemics of H3N2 influenza in Japan in 2002 and
2003 about 1/5 of children developed resistance by day 4 or later during
treatment with oseltamivir, and about 1/4 of children who shed virus for 3
days or more had drug-resistant influenza viruses. The
neuraminidase-resistant mutations isolated were found to be from 300 to 100
000 times more resistant to oseltamivir than oseltamivir-susceptible virus.
These reports of the emergence of drug resistance make the development of
new anti-influenza molecules a priority. Neuraminidases from influenza type
A viruses form 2 genetically distinct groups: group-1 contains the N1
neuraminidase of the H5N1 avian virus and group-2 contains the N2 and N9
enzymes used for the structure-based design of current drugs. Recently R J
Russell and colleagues have shown by X-ray crystallography that these 2
groups are structurally distinct. Group-1 neuraminidases contain a cavity
adjacent to their active sites that closes on ligand binding. These authors
suggest that this feature may facilitate the design of new
anti-neuraminidase drugs by allowing the size and location of the group-1
cavity to be altered (see: Russell RJ, Haire LF, Stevens DJ, Collins PJ,
Lin YP, Blackburn GM, et al. The structure of H5N1 avian influenza
neuraminidase suggests new opportunities for drug design. Nature 2006; 443
(7107): 37-38.). - Mod.CP]
