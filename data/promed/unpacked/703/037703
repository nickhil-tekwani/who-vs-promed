Bird flu spreading afresh; fowls culled in Netrakona, Gaibandha
---------------------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza has started spreading in different poultry farms
across the country again, as department of fisheries and livestock
detected the bird flu virus and culled birds at different places. Up
to 3 Mar 2009, a total of 1 663 702 chickens were culled since 2007
when bird flu was detected 1st in the country.

Authorities yesterday [6 Mar 2009] culled 2095 chickens and
destroyed 205 eggs following detection of bird flu in Netrakona and
Gaibandha. Earlier, on 28 Feb 2009, 188 chickens were culled and 60
eggs destroyed, according to the website of the Ministry of Fisheries
and Livestock.

Our correspondent from Netrakona reported that a total of 1595
chickens and 205 eggs were destroyed at a poultry farm at Kendua
upazila in Netrakona. Officials at Netrakona District Livestock
office said they detected bird flu virus at a poultry farm at Rampur
village under Kendua upazila Thursday night [5 Mar 2009].

"The virus was found when dead chickens of the farm were examined at
the district livestock laboratory by rapid antigen detection test
(RADT)," said an official. The laboratory test was conducted on
information that over a dozen chickens died in the farm during the
last 3 days, officials said.

Our Gaibandha correspondent reports: The livestock department of the
district yesterday culled around 500 chickens at Uttar Kazibari
village under Sadullahpur upazila immediately after detection of bird
flu virus in the areas. Sources said some 18 poultry birds died at
the Rampur village farm. Following the death of birds, Upazila
Livestock Officer Dr Uttam Kumar Das took samples of the dead
chickens and found the existence of avian influenza in the body of a
bird. A team later collected 500 poultry birds, including chickens,
and destroyed the birds on Upazila Parishad Complex.

"The government has been alert enough this season to monitor bird flu
cases. Wherever any bird flu virus is detected, authorities are
taking measures to check its outbreak," said Dr Giasuddin, chief
scientific officer at Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute. The
government with assistance from the UN Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO) has employed field volunteers since October 2008
to strengthen surveillance of bird flu in rural areas, he said.

According to the official website, the government found the presence
of the H5N1 virus at 308 farms in 47 districts and culled chickens of
568 farms up to 3 Mar 2009.

Outbreaks of the virus generally occur after the end of the rains in
October and continue until early June when the rains return.

Hong Kong bird tests positive for H5N1
--------------------------------------
Hong Kong authorities said Friday [6 Mar 2009] that a dead chicken
found in the southern Chinese territory had tested positive for the
deadly H5N1 strain of the bird flu virus. The government said
laboratory tests had confirmed that the chicken found floating in the
sea off Hong Kong on 2 Mar 2009 carried the deadly strain. The
statement said there were no poultry farms within 3 km (2 miles) of
where the dead bird was found, but warned farmers to be on their
guard against the disease.

Hong Kong was the scene of the world's 1st reported major H5N1 bird
flu outbreak among humans, in 1997, when 6 people died.

At least a dozen birds found in different parts of the territory have
tested positive in recent weeks for the H5N1 strain of the virus,
which can be fatal to humans. In December 2008, authorities found
H5N1 in a chicken at a poultry farm in Hong Kong, prompting the
slaughter of more than 90 000 birds.

[The detection of HPAI H5N1 in dead birds washed up on the beaches of
Hong Kong during the recent months have raised suspicions as being
indicative of a large avian-flu outbreak in neighbouring mainland
China; see 20090205.0514. - Mod.AS]
