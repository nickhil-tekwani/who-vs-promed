The New Mexico Department of Health confirmed today, 12 Aug 2013, a case of plague in a 15 year old boy from Torrance County who is currently hospitalized in stable condition. This is the 1st human case of plague in New Mexico and in the USA in 2013. An environmental investigation will take place at the boy's home to look for ongoing risk to others in the surrounding area.

"The Department of Health conducts an investigation when a plague case occurs to ensure the safety of the immediate family, neighbors, and health care providers," said Department of Health secretary Retta Ward, MPH. "We inform neighbors door-to-door about plague found in the area and educate them on reducing their risk. Health care providers and others close to the patient may also have been exposed, and are assessed to determine if they need preventive treatment."

Plague is a bacterial disease of rodents and is generally transmitted to humans through the bites of infected fleas, but can also be transmitted by direct contact with infected animals, including rodents, wildlife, and pets. "Plague activity in New Mexico is usually highest during the summer months, so it is especially important now to take precautions to avoid rodents and their fleas which can expose you to plague," said Dr Paul Ettestad, public health veterinarian for the Department of Health. "Pets that are allowed to roam and hunt can bring infected fleas from dead rodents back into the home, putting you and your children at risk."

To prevent plague, the Department of Health recommends:
- avoid sick or dead rodents and rabbits, and their nests and burrows;
- keep your pets from roaming and hunting;
- talk to your veterinarian about using an appropriate flea control product on your pets as not all products are safe for cats, dogs, or your children;
- clean up areas near the house where rodents could live, such as woodpiles, brush piles, junk, and abandoned vehicles;
- sick pets should be examined promptly by a veterinarian;
- see your doctor about any unexplained illness involving a sudden and severe fever;
- put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home;
- don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.

In New Mexico, there was 1 human plague case in 2012, 2 human cases of plague in 2011, no cases in 2010, and 6 human cases of plague in 2009, 1 of them fatal.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Ettestad for this report. The form of _Yersinia pestis_ infection -- bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic -- is not stated in the report but most cases are bubonic. The bubo is an extremely painful lymph node swelling in the area draining from the flea bite that introduced the bacillus.

A county map of the state of New Mexico (http://nmhealth.org/ERD/HealthData/documents/HumanPlagueinNMbyCounty1949-2012.pdf) shows that the concentration of human plague cases in New Mexico (1949-2012) is in the north western part of the state. Most USA cases of human plague infection occur in the Four Corner states -- the south western states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Colorado -- although California and Oregon have reported cases in recent years. - Mod.LL
