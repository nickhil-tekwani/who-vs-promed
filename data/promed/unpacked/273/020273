4 patients at Northern Ireland's biggest hospital [Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast] have tested [positive] for the rare infection [caused by] _Acinetobacter baumannii_ bacteria. It is a bug [that] is a risk for very ill people and is resistant to several drugs. It is understood the infected patients are currently in isolation within the intensive care unit.

The outbreak was discovered 3 weeks ago and control measures have been put in place. It said: "Belfast Health and Social Care Trust has recently identified an unusual multi[drug]-resistant microorganism called _Acinetobacter baumannii_ in the Regional Intensive Care Unit (RICU). A small number of patients have tested positive for this infection related to this organism and are currently isolated.

"An outbreak has been declared and the unit has been undergoing an intensive deep clean process over the weekend [22-23 Nov 2014] in line with patient safety and clinical advice and all infection control procedures are being regularly monitored. All patients remaining in the unit are being monitored in accordance with national guidelines. The Trust would like to assure the public that robust infection prevention and control measures are in place and we are working closely with the Public Health Agency and all other Trusts to control the spread of this organism. We would ask that visitors help us to prevent the spread of infection by being diligent regarding hand washing both on entering and leaving the unit. We are extremely grateful for the flexibility shown by our patients, their relatives, and our staff to support our programme of deep cleaning over the weekend."

What is multi[drug]-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_ (MRAB)?
MRAB are germs that live in soil, water, the general environment, and on skin. In most people, MRAB germs are harmless and do not cause infection. However, if a patient is prone to infection and the infection is caused by MRAB, it can be difficult to treat.

Can MRAB be harmful?
For most patients, MRAB lives harmlessly in the bowel and on the skin not causing infection. Sometimes MRAB can cause infection in patients, for example when they need intensive care or while receiving chemotherapy. Doctors need to know as soon as possible if a patient is carrying MRAB so that the most effective antibiotics can be chosen to treat the infection.

[The news release above fails to state if clinical isolates from the cases of nosocomial multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_ (MDR-AB) infection were genotyped and if the clinical isolates proved to have identical genotypes. Also, it would be important to know if environmental sampling were done, and if genotypes of any environmental MDR-AB isolates matched that of the clinical isolates. At times, some patients may become asymptomatic carriers of MDR-AB and contribute to continued transmission of this organism if these colonized patients are not identified and also placed in isolation.

The Belfast Health & Social care Trust is one of the largest Healthcare Trusts (a public sector corporation) in the UK; the Royal Victoria Hospital provides over 20 percent of the acute-care beds in Northern Ireland and treats half a million patients a year; and the Regional Intensive Care Unit (RICU) is the largest critical care unit in Northern Ireland with 25 beds (http://knock.qub.ac.uk/itrent_web_rec_docs/14_103566/APPENDIX-A.pdf).

The following has been mostly extracted from moderator ML's comments in ProMED-mail post Acinetobacter, resistant, fatal - Japan: (Tokyo) RFI 20100907.3203:

_Acinetobacter baumannii_ (AB), a Gram negative coccobacillus, has emerged as a significant multidrug-resistant (MDR) nosocomial pathogen. Infection due to multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter_ strains, especially _A. baumannii_ (MDR-AB), in critically ill, hospitalized patients and the frequency of clonal nosocomial outbreaks due to these microorganisms has increased worldwide in the past several decades (see Urban C, et al: Considerations in control and treatment of nosocomial infections due to multidrug-resistant _Acinetobacter baumannii_. Clin Infect Dis. 2003; 36(10): 1268-74; available at http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/374847). MDR-AB have also been reported recently to cause infections after natural disasters (such as, earthquakes) (see Joly-Guillou ML. Clinical impact and pathogenicity of _Acinetobacter_. Clin Microbiol Infect. 2005; 11(11): 868-73; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16216100), and in soldiers severely injured in the war in Iraq.

During nosocomial outbreaks, MDR-AB have been recovered from various sites in the patients' environment and can survive on environmental surfaces for long periods of time, including curtains, furniture, and hospital equipment. MDR-AB has been reported to spread most commonly on the hands of hospital personnel from the contaminated environment or from patients who are either infected or colonized with MDR-AB. In addition, airborne spread of MDR-AB has recently been described in a burn unit (Gao J, Zhao X, Bao Y, et al: Antibiotic resistance and OXA-type carbapenemases-encoding genes in airborne _Acinetobacter baumannii_ isolated from burn wards. Burns. 2014; 40(2): 295-9; doi: 10.1016/j.burns.2013.06.003; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23886986).

Some isolates are susceptible only to the polymyxins [such as colistin] and sulbactam (Go ES, Urban C, et al: Clinical and molecular epidemiology of _Acinetobacter_ infections sensitive only to polymyxin B and sulbactam. Lancet 1994; 344(8933): 1329-32; abstract available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7968028), although resistance to these antibiotics has also been reported. [Sulbactam is a beta-lactam that is most commonly used in combination with ampicillin to inhibit certain bacterial beta-lactamases that would otherwise break down ampicillin and thereby to allow ampicillin to kill the bacteria. Versus _Acinetobacter_, however, sulbactam itself exhibits antibacterial property.]

Attempts to reduce the frequency of nosocomial infections due to MDR-AB have involved restriction of antibiotic use and enhanced infection control interventions (see Urban C, et al (2003): reference above) that involve placement of patients colonized or infected with MDR-AB on contact precautions, cohorting, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys to look for other cases of MDR-AB and active-surveillance testing of patients with epidemiologic links to persons from whom MDR-AB have been recovered (MMWR 2009; 58(10): 256-60; available at:
http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5810a4.htm) and CDC Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC): Management of Multidrug-Resistant Organisms [MDRO] in Healthcare Settings, 2006 - IV. MDRO Prevention and Control; available at http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/mdro/mdro_4.html. - Mod.ML
