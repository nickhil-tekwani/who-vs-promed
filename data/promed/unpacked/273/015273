A disease known as banana xanthomonas wilt (BXW) is ravaging the crop in different parts of the country, but mainly in western Kenya. The bacterium was first reported in Ethiopia in 1968. Since then, it has been spreading. In Kenya, the disease was first reported in 2006.

The current outbreak in the region is significant because western Kenya produces over 60 per cent of bananas consumed in Kenya. It could have serious consequences on food and income security of small-scale farmers. Yield losses of 10 to 100 per cent have been reported depending on cultivar susceptibility, stage of growth of the plant and the prevailing climatic conditions. [It is] most important to prevent spread and eliminate the pathogen early.

High incidences have been reported in western Kenya due to major use of susceptible varieties, some imported from Uganda, and failure by farmers to remove the male bud [see comment below]. The disease must be monitored. Farmers can potentially spread the disease through contaminated tools. Ferrying of planting materials should also be discouraged.

[_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _musacearum_ is the causal organism of banana bacterial wilt in central Africa (BXW; bacterial wilts due to _Ralstonia_ species are present elsewhere). It affects all banana types causing wilting and premature ripening of fruit. An incidence of 70-80 per cent in many plantations and yield losses of up to 90 per cent have been reported.

The bacteria survive in soil and plant debris and are mainly spread via infected planting material, by insects, mechanical means, and contaminated tools. A range of alternate hosts may serve as pathogen reservoirs. An integrated approach is needed for disease management. Removal of male buds immediately after fruit set, as mentioned above, has been found to prevent transmission of bacterial ooze by insects. Other control measures may include crop rotation, disinfection of orchard tools, use of certified clean material for replanting, as well as phytosanitation to reduce inoculum and prevent re-introduction and plant-to-plant spread of the pathogen. However, these measures may be difficult to implement with smallholders. No resistant banana cultivars have been identified. Research is being carried out on transgenic lines of banana containing capsicum genes for field resistance to BXW.

An outbreak of BXW has also been reported earlier in 2016 from northern Rwanda (see link below).
