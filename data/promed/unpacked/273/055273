On [5 Nov 2013], Chinese health authorities reported 2 more novel H7N9 infections from different parts of the country, including in a 3-year-old boy with mild illness who is hospitalized [previously reported in ProMED-mail post: Avian influenza, human (134): China (GD), H7N9, child 20131105.2040007], according to media reports and an early notification from the World Health Organization (WHO). The cases are the 3rd and 4th to be reported since the middle of October 2013 and would boost China's number of H7N9 infections to 139, which includes 45 deaths.

The boy is hospitalized in Dongguan City in southern China's Guangdong province, where he is in stable condition, Xinhua, China's state news agency reported in [November 2013]. His infection was detected during routine hospital monitoring of flu like cases. Donnguan is a large industrial city that borders Guangzhou, the provincial capital. The youngster's illness is Guangdong's 2nd H7N9 case. The province's 1st case was reported in early August 2013, months after the virus was detected in poultry markets there. Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said in a statement that the boy doesn't have a fever and his flu-like symptoms are minor. All 7 of the boy's close contacts who were under close observation tested negative for the virus, though 3 had flu-like symptoms.

Very few details were available about the 2nd case-patient, who is from Zhejiang province. The 1st news of the detection came from WHO Twitter posts, which said China had notified it of 2 new lab-confirmed H7N9 cases in Guangdong and Zhejiang. Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman, said in separate Twitter posts that the 2 H7N9 cases were reported from different parts of China on the same day. "Winter is starting," he said.

In October 2013, Zhejiang province, located roughly 800 miles northeast of Guangdong, reported 2 H7N9 cases, in a 35-year-old man who was hospitalized in critical condition and in a 67-year-old farmer who had contact with live poultry and was also listed in critical condition. Zhejiang is the Chinese province with the most H7N9 cases, with 49 infections and 11 deaths reported so far.

When the H7N9 virus was 1st detected China in [March 2013], the number of cases soared and then dropped sharply in May 2013, with only 2 additional cases reported over the summer. Global health officials said poultry-market closures probably played a role in the declining number of cases, and there was a chance that the virus could burn itself out. They said, however, that they expected sporadic cases to continue. And they warned that although flu viruses are unpredictable, there was a chance that the number of cases could start rising again as the Northern Hemisphere's weather cools, a pattern seen with other avian influenza viruses such as H5N1.

The 4 H7N9 infections reported in China so far this fall [2013] are fueling speculation that the events could herald another wave of infections with the new virus, but some influenza experts say it's too soon to tell.

Marion Koopmans, head of virology at the Laboratory for Infectious Diseases of the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands, said the timing of the cases gives a hint of seasonality, but she said so far there are too few of them and that it's too early to say whether they signify a trend. She said it would be useful to see some information from periodic market surveys to assess possible trends. "Whether or not we expect seasonality is related to the question where these viruses come from," Koopmans said, adding that H5 seasonality reports seem to come mainly from behavior of the virus in wild birds. "If H7N9 is circulating in backyard farms, the picture may be quite different."

Poultry are strongly suspected to be the source of the new virus, and the WHO has warned that since H7N9 causes only subclinical infection in the birds, it could still be circulating in China and perhaps its neighbors. It has urged China and bordering countries to continue vigilance for the virus.

Human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus - update, 6 Nov 2013
--------------------------
The National Health and Family Planning Commission, China notified WHO of 2 new laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus.

The 1st patient is a 3-year-old boy from Guangdong Province who had contact with live poultry. He became ill on [29 Oct 2013], was admitted to a local hospital on [31 Oct 2013], and transferred to another hospital on [4 Nov 2013]. He is currently in a stable condition.

The 2nd patient is a 64-year-old woman from Zhejiang Province who is a farmer and had contact with live poultry. She became ill on [30 Oct 2013], was admitted to a local hospital on [31 Oct 2013], and was transferred to another hospital on [3 Nov 2013]. She is currently in a critical condition.

To date, WHO has been informed of a total of 139 laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection including 45 deaths.

Currently, 6 patients are hospitalized and 88 have been discharged. So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

The Chinese government has taken the following surveillance and control measures:
- strengthening of epidemic surveillance and analysis;
- deployment of medical treatment;
- conducting public risk communication and information dissemination;
- strengthening international cooperation and exchanges; and
- is continuing to carry out scientific research.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event, nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

[As yet, little information is available about the new case in Zhejiang province, other than that the patient is presumed to be an adult. New information about the 1st case is that the young boy doesn't have a fever and his flu-like symptoms are minor. In addition, all 7 of the boy's close contacts who were under close observation tested negative for the virus, though 3 had flu-like symptoms. These features raise new questions about the prevalence of the H7N9 virus and its mode of transmission to humans. - Mod.CP
