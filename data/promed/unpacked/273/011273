A total of 16 people have suffered from eating fish from Lake
Kotokel. 12 are in the hospital, 3 have been discharged, and one
person has died as a result of foodborne toxic paroxysmal myoglobinuria.

It is an acute disease that sporadically takes place among predator
fish. The etiology of the disease is unknown, but the ill fish can be
toxic for people. The 1st outbreak of the disease was registered in
Gaff [Haff] bay. The cause of the disease in fish are plant toxins
and can lead to mass deaths of fish. A state of emergency has been
declared in this location.

[The Republic of Buryatia can be located on the map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/russiaaddivisions.jpg>.
Lake Kotokel is situated 2 km (1.2 mi) away from the east coast of
Lake Baikal, just south of Turka. It can be located on the interactive map at
<http://encarta.msn.com/map_701513902/Baikal_Lake.html>. - CopyEd.MJ

The disease has occurred once before, in 2000-2001, and has been
registered in Tomsk. The outbreak is associated with the rise of
water level and worsening of hydrobiological situation. There is no
treatment, and prevention is through avoiding fishing from an
infected source. See:

Haff disease is a syndrome of unexplained rhabdomyolysis following
consumption of certain types of fish; it is caused by an unidentified
toxin. Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome caused by injury to
skeletal muscle that results in release of muscle cell contents into
the circulation. In 1997, 6 cases of Haff disease were identified in
the United States (4 in California and 2 in Missouri) among persons
who ate buffalo fish (_Ictiobus cyprinellus_), a bottom-feeding
species found mostly in the Mississippi River or its tributaries.

MMWR (Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report) article at

Haff disease associated with eating buffalo fish -- United States, 1997
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
MMWR. December 25, 1998 / 47(50); 1091-3 and the editorial note is
worth presenting in a mod comment:

"Editorial note: During the 1920s, the name "Haff disease" was given
to an illness characterized by severe muscle pain and stiffness that
affected approximately 1000 persons living along the Koenigsberg
Haff, a brackish inlet of the Baltic Sea (1). Subsequent similar
outbreaks were identified in Sweden and the former Soviet Union
(2-4). Although the etiology was not determined, epidemiologic
investigations linked illness to ingestion of fish, especially burbot.

The 1st reported case of Haff disease in the United States occurred
in Texas in 1984 (M Tormey, Los Angeles Department of Health
Services, personal communication, 1997); five additional cases were
reported in California during 1984-1986. All U.S. cases have been
associated with eating buffalo fish.

Haff disease typically presents as a paroxysm of rhabdomyolysis, with
accompanying muscle tenderness, rigidity, and dark brown urine.
However, as in patient 3, milder presentations also occur. Although
the median incubation period for the patients in this report was 8
hours (range: 6-21 hours), symptoms generally appear approximately 18
hours after eating fish.

Laboratory features of Haff disease include a markedly elevated CK
[creatine kinase] level with an MB fraction of less than 5 percent.
Levels of other muscle enzymes (such as, lactate dehydrogenase,
glutamate oxalate transaminase, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase)
also are elevated. Myoglobinuria is often mistaken for gross
hematuria (5). Diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical history.

Treatment is supportive and consists of administering large volumes
of fluid early in the course of illness to prevent myoglobin toxicity
to the renal tubules (5). Possible complications include electrolyte
disturbances, renal failure, and disseminated intra-vascular
coagulation. Symptoms usually resolve within 2-3 days. Historically,
the case-fatality rate is approximately one percent (1).

Clinicians and public health practitioners are encountering an
increasing variety of foodborne illnesses, in part because of a
diversification of food preparation and eating habits. International
travelers, members of ethnic groups with unique cuisines, and
consumers of both imported and domestic specialty food items may be
at risk for foodborne illnesses that are rare or have not been
reported previously in the United States. Clinicians should be aware
of food exposures that pose a risk to their patients and routinely
obtain food histories, even from those patients whose illness may not
appear to be food-related.

Physicians who identify or suspect cases of Haff disease, based on
the clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, and food history,
should report them to public health authorities for initiation of
traceback and recall of implicated food items. State health
departments are requested to report to the Foodborne and Diarrheal
Diseases Branch, Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National
Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC, tel (404) 639-2206.
