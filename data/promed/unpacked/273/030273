- Goa. 12 Jul 2018. Dengue, which normally affects urban areas, is now spreading its tentacles in the rural areas of the state. Officials of the Directorate of Health Services (DHS) on Wednesday [11 Jul 2018] said that the number of dengue cases has been increasing in rural areas, and they attributed the rise to stagnant water and lack of a waste-disposal system. The state has recorded 56 cases of dengue from January until May this year [2018]. However, in June [2018], 68 new cases were reported, taking the total number of cases to 124; this increase indicates that there is a surge in dengue cases. The number of dengue cases in the first 6 months of 2017 was 90. As per the data provided by DHS, the state recorded the highest number of 293 dengue cases in 2015. Following the outbreak in 2015, the health department launched a massive drive and managed to bring down the number of such cases to 150 in 2016. Despite awareness and government's efforts, the number of dengue cases rose to 235 in 2017.

Taiwan
- 2 Jul 2018. A Kaohsiung man in his 30s has become the 1st reported indigenous dengue fever (DEVV-3) case in Taiwan this year [2018], the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) announced on Monday [2 Jul 2018]. The CDC determined that the patient was this year's 1st indigenous dengue fever case in Taiwan because he did not travel overseas during the incubation period prior to the onset of his disease. The disease does not seem to have spread, however, because none of the patient's family members or those living in his community have developed any suspicious symptoms to date. DENV-1 and DENV-2 have been the dominant strains in major dengue fever outbreaks in the past few years, except for in 2010, when a minor DENV-3 outbreak took place in Kaohsiung. There have been only a few isolated cases of DENV-3 infection in Taiwan since the 2010 outbreak. DENV-3 in Taiwan is usually considered to be an imported DENV strain, originating mainly in the Philippines, and the CDC could not rule out the possibility of imported cases hidden in the patient's neighborhood.

- 11 Jul 2018. The 2nd indigenous dengue fever case of this year in Taiwan has been confirmed, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported on Wednesday [11 Jul 2018]. The patient sought medical treatment 9 Jul 2018 after suffering from diarrhea, and a blood test confirmed on 10 Jul 2018 the dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) infection. The patient was then put into isolation. The patient did not travel overseas during the incubation period prior to the onset of his disease, CDC deputy director-general Philip Lo said, but during the period, he stayed in Kaohsiung with his family from 3 to 6 Jul 2018 before traveling to Taitung. It was thought that the patient's diarrhea was related to dengue fever infection, Lo said, but a local survey found that only about 33 per cent of patients infected with DENV-2 during a 2015 dengue outbreak in Taiwan suffered from diarrhea. As of 10 Jul 2018, 2 indigenous dengue fever cases have been reported in Taiwan this year, according to CDC statistics.

[2] Vector modification studies
[2a] Wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes modification study
Date: 16 Jul 2018
Source: Xinhua [edited]
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-07/16/c_137328193.htm


Fiji has identified the hot spots for dengue fever where officials of the World Mosquito Program (WMP) will release the wolbachia-carrying mosquitoes on Monday [16 Jul 2018] to curb the spread of dengue, Zika and chikungunya diseases. According to the Fiji Broadcasting Corporation (FBC), over 7 million Fijian dollars (about USD 3.3 million) is being spent on piloting the project across Fiji, Vanuatu and Kiribati. The 1st batch of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito carrying wolbachia bacteria will be released on Monday [16 Jul 2018] along the roadsides between the Lami to Nausori corridor on Fiji's Queens Road. Wolbachia is a natural and safe bacterium that reduces the ability of _A. aegypti_ mosquitoes to transmit viruses between people. The bacteria-carrying mosquitoes breed with the wild _A. aegypti_ mosquitoes in the area, passing wolbachia to their offspring.

It is not an emergency measure but rather a long-term, self-sustaining solution to significantly reduce the risk of future outbreaks in high-risk areas. The WMP's wolbachia method is also compatible with other methods such as insecticides and vaccines. Project manager Geoff Wilson said the results from similar projects in other countries showed that the natural wolbachia method was self-sustaining up to 7 years after their release. Mosquitoborne diseases are a health concern for people living in Fiji. In 2017, about 2200 dengue cases were reported in the island nation. The WMP and the Ministry of Health and Medical Services in Fiji have made a commitment to working together to pilot an innovative approach to protect people from mosquitoborne diseases such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya.

[2b] Australian experiment wipes out over 80 per cent of disease-carrying mosquitoes
Date: 16 Jul 2018
Source: CNN [edited]
https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/10/australia/australia-mosquito-disease-experiment-intl/index.html


In an experiment with global implications, Australian scientists have successfully wiped out more than 80 per cent of disease-carrying mosquitoes in trial locations across north Queensland. The experiment, conducted by scientists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) and James Cook University (JCU), targeted _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes, which spread deadly diseases such as dengue fever and Zika.

In JCU laboratories, researchers bred almost 20 million mosquitoes, infecting males with bacteria that made them sterile. Then, last summer [2017], they released over 3 million of them in 3 towns on the Cassowary Coast. The sterile male mosquitoes did not bite or spread disease, but when they mated with wild females, the resulting eggs did not hatch, and the population crashed. "The invasive _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito is one of the world's most dangerous pests," said CSIRO director of health and biosecurity Rob Grenfell in a statement, describing the experiment as a victory. "Although the majority of mosquitoes do not spread diseases, the 3 mostly deadly types -- the aedes, anopheles and culex -- are found almost all over the world and are responsible for around (17 per cent) of infectious disease transmissions globally."

The successful experiment offers a potential new solution against diseases that infect millions every year. Many mosquito-spread diseases are difficult to treat. Some do not have effective vaccines; pesticides can be unsustainable; and methods such as clearing standing water are inefficient against mosquito breeding rates. The Zika virus is an infamous example. Its explosive outbreak in 2015 infected millions worldwide, causing babies to be born with neurological disorders. Researchers raced to develop a vaccine, and many are still conducting trials.

Although the process used in the experiment, called the Sterile Insect Technique, has been around since the 1950s, it has never been used for mosquitoes like the _A. aegypti_. "We learned a lot from collaborating on this first tropical trial and we're excited to see how this approach might be applied in other regions where _Aedes aegypti_ poses a threat to life and health," Kyran Staunton from JCU said in a statement. Scientists in the Cairns region of Australia have also used similar techniques to replace populations with mosquitoes that could not spread infections, according to ABC News. This CSIRO-JCU experiment, however, aimed to eradicate those populations altogether, working in partnership with Verily, a health research organization owned by Google parent Alphabet.

Because the _A. aegypti_ is an invasive species native to Africa, wiping them out in Australia would not do much ecological damage in the country. "The main ecological impact would be to restore the ecosystem to how it was before the mosquitoes invaded," according to Verily. The experiment has been limited to north Queensland for now, but Verily may hold further field trials, the organization said.

Rates of severe virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) over a 5-year period for all ages considered were about 70 per cent lower in the vaccinated group as compared with the control group. A tetravalent dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) was found protective against severe VCD and decreased hospitalizations because of VCD for 5 years in patients with previous dengue exposure before vaccination, according to a case-cohort study in the New England Journal of Medicine that reanalyzed data from vaccine efficacy studies.

Excess hospitalizations for dengue were observed among vaccine recipients 2 to 5 years of age in the original efficacy trials (clinicaltrial.gov: NCT00842530, NCT01983553, NCT01373281, and NCT01374516), and precise risk estimates according to observed dengue serostatus could not be determined because of limited baseline sample collections. Investigators here developed a dengue anti-nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and using samples from month 13 inferred serostatus for post hoc safety and efficacy analyses.

The cumulative 5-year incidence of hospitalization for VCD among dengue-seronegative patients 2 to 16 years of age was 3.06 per cent for patients receiving the vaccine and 1.87 per cent among control participants, with a hazard ratio (vaccine vs control) through data cutoff of 1.75 (95 per cent confidence interval [CI] 1.14-2.70). Among seronegative participants aged 9 to 16 years the cumulative incidence of hospitalization was 1.57 per cent among vaccine recipients and 1.09 per cent for controls, with a hazard ratio of 1.41 (CI 0.74-2.68). Similar trends were also found for severe VCD. Among seropositive patients 2 to 16 years of age and patients 9 to 16 years of age, the cumulative incidence of hospitalization for VCD was 0.75 per cent and 0.38 per cent, respectively, among vaccine recipients, and 2.47 per cent and 1.88 per cent among control participants, with hazard ratios of 0.32 (CI 0.23-0.45) and 0.21 (CI 0.14-0.31). The risk of severe VCD was also lower among seropositive vaccine recipients than seropositive controls.

The results support the hypothesis that without previous dengue exposure, the vaccine can mimic a primary infection and increase the risk of severe dengue during subsequent infections. The results were supported by a general consistency of findings obtained from multiple analytic methods, although each relied on its own assumptions. The authors also note that "although we used a new assay after characterization and qualification, neither the anti-NS1 assay nor the PRNT is validated or registered for the purpose of determining baseline dengue serostatus." Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that predictive values will vary according to epidemiological contexts. Still, the results may affect implementation of dengue vaccine programs and highlight the need for a rapid, reliable test for previous dengue exposure.
