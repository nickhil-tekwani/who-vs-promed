2000/185 Telediagnostic methods used in Norway
-------------------------------------------------
In collaboration with the Norwegian Agriculture Inspection, [the] NCRI
Plant Protection Centre has investigated the use of telediagnostics in
plant protection. [A regional office in Oslo] is equipped with video
cameras mounted on microscope and binocular (?), in addition to [a]
conference camera, scanner and document camera.
Live video pictures are sent via telephone lines to a diagnostic laboratory
in Aas, where specialists [can assist diagnosis at short notice]. The
inspector in Oslo is trained to prepare specimens. Control of the
microscope manipulations may be swapped between the local and the
remote/central offices.
[Results of a pilot study in 2000 showed that different organisms could be]
accurately identified using this equipment. This has allowed [shippers] to
save valuable time during clearance of commodities. In addition, closer
contact between inspectors and diagnostic specialists has led to a better
understanding of the problems to be shared between the 2 groups.
The Norwegian Agriculture Inspection [plans] to equip all regional offices
with the same type of equipment in order to provide a better service to the
plant industry. Extension services may also benefit from this type of
equipment, which provides faster [diagnoses].
