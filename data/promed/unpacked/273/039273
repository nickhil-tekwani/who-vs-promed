There has been no reported case of bird flu in the Papua Province on the
Indonesia side of the border, says the National Agriculture Quarantine and
Inspection Authority (NAQIA). Slamming a Post-Courier front page story on
Thursday [23 Mar 2006] that alleged the outbreak of the deadly bird flu
virus in Papua's Timika area, NAQIA managing director Andrew Yamanea said
the closest bird flu case reported was in South Sulawesi and the article
was ill-informed and unverified.
He said classical swine fever (hog cholera) was the only animal-born
disease recently reported in Timika which could have been mistaken for the
bird flu virus. "The closest bird flu-infected province in Indonesia to
Papua is South Sulawesi in the east and quite far from PNG," Mr Yamanea
said. "There is, however, confirmation of classical swine fever (hog
cholera) cases in Timika area in Papua Province that we are aware of. Hog
cholera is predominately a pig disease and does not affect humans but is a
serious fatal disease in pigs and can spread very rapidly within a pig
population. NAQIA has already issued alert notices for this disease to its
officers on the ground. This could be the disease that has been confused
with bird flu in the Post-Courier report. NAQIA has in place surveillance
and monitoring system in PNG and disease information networking system with
neighbouring countries and regional animal health organisation to be
well-informed of the animal disease situations in the region, including
Papua Province."
The NAQIA will conduct joint public awareness campaigns with the Health
Department and the OK Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) in areas identified as
high risks, especially those located close to a national border such as
Sandaun Province.
Mr Yamanea, who stressed that the authority was mindful of the bird flu
virus threat as well as plant- and animalborne diseases, urged public
servants and local communities to report cases of animals or plants dying
mysteriously. "NAQIA has also issued instructions and distributed disease
information sheets and posters for target diseases under surveillance to
NAQIA and DPI offices in the border provinces to alert communities in these
areas to take necessary measures," he said.
NAQIA is collaborating with the Health Department and the World Health
Organisation's PNG office to develop a pandemic emergency preparedness plan
for the country. But the Post-Courier report's writer Ian Kakarere, and the
source of his story, NAQIA's Kiunga officer Kaiki Namalu, refused to back
down from their story.

[According to Indonesia's last report to the OIE, sent on 6 Jan 2006, the
following main regions had been affected by avian influenza: Nanggroe Aceh
Darussalam; Bali Badung; Jakarta South; Jambi Sarolangun; West Jawa;
Central Jawa; Lampung Bandar; West Lampung; Lampung Tangamus; Lampung
Tulang; Riau Dumai; South Sulawesi; South-east Sulawesi; West Sulawesi;
South Selatan; North Sumatra; Yogyakarta. Administrative map at
<http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/db/Indonesia_provinces_english.png>.
The alleged confusion between avian influenza and swine fever, 2 quite
different disease entities, is not easy to explain. A fresh update from
Indonesia's veterinary authorities would help to clarify the situation. -

[2] Cambodia, south west, ducks: new outbreaks
Date: Thu, 30 Mar 2006

Bird flu has been found in ducks on 2 family farms in south western
Cambodia, a little more than a week after a toddler died from the H5N1
virus in the country, officials say.
Though no new human infections have been found, the latest outbreak marks
the 4th time in 2 months the virus has struck in Cambodia after a year
without any reported cases. "We have a new outbreak of bird flu," said Kao
Phal, director for the agriculture ministry's Department of Animal Health.
Samples taken from 3 ducks in Kampot province's Angkor Chey district tested
positive for the H5N1 strain of the virus, which has killed 5 people in
Cambodia and resulted in the slaughter of thousands of birds since 2003. A
number of ducks have died on the 2 farms, and nearly 200 were slaughtered
after the virus was detected.
The discovery follows the death of a 3 year old girl from bird flu on 21
Mar 2006. Prime minister Hun Sen has called for the government to step up
its public awareness campaigns, as bird flu remains a mystery to many rural
Cambodians.
People from the dead toddler's village told AFP just after her death that
they had been eating chickens that fell ill and died. Most poultry in
Cambodia is raised on small farms or in backyards, making it difficult to
prevent the spread of the virus.
The virus has been found in ducks in the eastern province of Kompong Cham
twice since February 2006, triggering the slaughter of hundreds of birds.
Thousands of birds smuggled in from Vietnam, next to Kampot province, have
also been destroyed in recent months.

[3] Thailand, dogs, H5N1 suspected
Date: Thu, 30 Mar 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

[We are grateful to Joe Dudley, who -- in conjunction with posted media
reports on avian influenza in dogs (Oct 2004 in Thailand and Mar 2006 in
Azerbaijan) -- has drawn our attention to the above-referenced report. -
Mod.AS]
Besides cats, the said review addresses avian influenza in other (non
avian) animal species. The following excerpt appears under the title
"Information for veterinarians":
Carnivores:
Carnivores can become infected, after consuming infected poultry that
succumbed to the disease. To date no H5N1 clinical cases of dogs have been
reported but in an unpublished study carried out in 2005 by the National
Institute of Animal Health in Bangkok, researchers tested 629 village dogs
and 111 cats in the Suphan Buri district of central Thailand. Out of these,
160 dogs and 8 cats had antibodies to H5N1, indicating that they were
infected with the virus or had been infected in the past. [see comment
further].
An equine virus has recently shown up in dogs. This inter-species
re-assortment is not uncommon for type A influenza viruses.
Pigs:
Pigs are known "mixing vessels" for different influenza virus subtypes and
therefore present a risk for avian influenza virus re-[assorting] with a
human influenza virus into a strain more apt to infect humans. Regarding
the present H5N1 subtype, studies conducted in pigs in Vietnam yielded 8
seropositive animals out of the 3000 pigs tested. None of the animals had
any clinical signs and it was not possible to isolate any virus
Ruminants:
Ruminants are susceptible to influenza viruses but so far mainly H3N8 have
been identified. Regular vaccination is carried out. Experimentally mice
can be infected but their role in natural transmission has not been
established.

[In view of the significance of possible involvement of dogs in H5N1
epidemiology and the lack of scientific references, we have tried to obtain
more information on the unpublished study carried out in 2005 by the
National Institute of Animal Health in Bangkok. The following commentary
has been kindly provided by a colleague in Thailand who spoke with the
researchers and had the following comments:
"There are several pieces of information that need to be clarified.
1. The cutoff point in this study is 1:40. The scientists are still
debating what the real cutoff point for dogs. They are doing further
studies using other methods. Currently they are in doubt about the high
percentage of seroreactivity in the dogs.
2. This study was done during the 2nd quarter of 2005 in an area that has a
large poultry outbreak.
3. A possible explanation is that the dogs and cats eat sick poultry.
4. While there was a report of a dead cat with H5 in the 1st round
outbreak, there is no report in dogs. Most are asymptomatic.
In conclusion, it is likely that dogs can be infected by H5 but the
[possibility] of spreading the disease to humans is unlikely. However, the
role of spreading disease among dogs or to other poultry deserved further
study."
We hope that these observations will lead to further studies and
conclusions, in Thailand or elsewhere. Field observations remain the most
important source of information -- and which ProMED-mail would appreciate
receiving. At present, the information on H5N1 in dogs remains anecdotal. -

on Kegnaes in the southern part of Jutland.
The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration is implementing measures in
accordance with Commission Decision 2006/115/EC including establishing a
protection and surveillance zone. Kegnaes is located near Sonderborg, and
surveillance zone already established on 29 Mar 2006 is therefore not
changed, but a new protection zone has been established.

[5] Cameroon, wild duck

The government of Cameroon, the 4th African country affected by the deadly
H5N1 virus, has confirmed the presence of a 2nd case of bird flu.
In a statement on Wed, 29 Mar 2006, minister for livestock, fisheries and
animal industries Aboukary Sarki said a specialist Italian laboratory
detected the H5N1 virus on a wild duck found dead on Lake Malape, situated
40 km west of Garoua near the border with Nigeria. The minister urged
people in the area "not to manipulate bodies of dead wild birds ... not to
consume flesh of any wild bird and to alert veterinary officials of dead
birds found in their vicinities".
The case in the West African nation's North province comes 2 weeks after
the announcement of a first case detected still farther north in Maroua.
After the outbreak of bird flu in Nigeria in February 2006, the first
African country hit by the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain, Cameroon banned
poultry imports both from across the Nigerian border and from other
countries where the disease has been detected. It also intensified controls
along its 1600-km frontier with Nigeria though consumer groups said poultry
products were still filtering across the porous border.
Over 1000 chicks were found dead around Maroua in the same week as bird flu
was first detected in Cameroon, and at least 400 birds have died since in
and around the capital Yaounde, said the Inspector General at the
Livestock, Fisheries and Animal Industries Ministry, Oumaoru Dawa.
The virus has not been confirmed in the southern region, though some 240
chickens were recently reported dead in the southwest provincial town of
Limbe on the Atlantic coast. Samples of some of the dead birds are still
being tested.
Meanwhile consumption of chicken and eggs has fallen drastically, with
prices slashed by 50 to 75 per cent.
