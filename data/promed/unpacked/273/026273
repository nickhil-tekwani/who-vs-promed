[1] Wales: badger vaccination trial

More than 1400 badgers have been vaccinated under trials to drive down bovine TB in Wales.

Environment Minister John Griffiths said the Welsh government had completed the 1st part of its badger vaccination programme. The trials replaced a controversial cull, which was scrapped in March [2012], and were carried out in parts of west Wales dubbed an intensive action area (IAA). The IAA is primarily located in north Pembrokeshire, but includes small parts of Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire.

The Welsh government said last year [2011] it was one of the areas with the highest incidence of bovine TB in Europe.

Mr Griffiths said: "Provisional figures indicate that since May we have successfully caught and vaccinated over 1400 badgers in the IAA. Our vaccination programme has enabled Wales to take quick and decisive action to develop a degree of immunity to TB within the badger population in the IAA.

"We believe that this should reduce the risk of TB transmission from badgers to cattle and contribute to the eradication of bovine TB over time."

The minister has asked Chief Veterinary Officer for Wales Dr Christianne Glossop to consider other areas for vaccination. He added: "The success of the badger vaccination initiative is dependent on staff being granted access to as much land as possible.

"I would like to thank farmers and landowners for their ongoing co-operation and encourage other partners and stakeholders to consider how they could work with us to increase the number of badgers we can vaccinate in Wales."

The IAA covers 288 sq km (110 sq mi) and it is thought to be the 1st time a project to cage and vaccinate badgers has been carried out on this scale.

The decision to scrap the cull angered political opponents and agricultural unions who say the disease has a devastating impact on cattle farms.

[2] Northern Ireland: bTB epidemiological study
Date: Fri 30 Nov 2012

Transmission of tuberculosis [TB] between cattle and badgers has been tracked at a local scale for the 1st time, using a combination of bacterial whole-genome DNA sequencing and mathematical modelling. The findings highlight the potential for next-generation sequencing to be used to understand the impact of badgers on TB outbreaks in cows at the farm level.

The role of badgers in the transmission of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) among cattle remains controversial: the government's proposal to implement a widespread badger cull in England was recently delayed and has met with extensive criticism over its evidence base.

Previous studies have used lower resolution genetic typing of bacteria and information observed during an outbreak to identify links between cattle and badgers. Until now, however, direct evidence of transmission of the bacteria between the 2 hosts at the farm scale has been lacking.

In this study, researchers made use of advances in genetic technologies to sequence whole genomes of bacteria that had been isolated from 26 cows and 4 badgers from a group of neighbouring farms in Northern Ireland over a decade-long history of repeated bTB outbreaks. This approach enabled the team to retrospectively trace changes in the bacteria's DNA as it passed from animal to animal.

The findings reveal that the bacteria isolated from badgers and cattle were extremely closely related, and indistinguishable bacterial types were often obtained from badgers and nearby cattle farms. Moreover, the bacteria isolated from the 2 species were more closely related to each other than they were to farms even a few kilometres away.

"This study provides the 1st direct evidence of the close relationship between tuberculosis infections in cows and local badgers, at a very local scale," explains Professor Rowland Kao, a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow who led the study jointly conducted by the University of Glasgow and the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute in Northern Ireland. "However, only with a larger study might we be able to quantify the extent and direction of transmission between cattle and badgers and reliably inform disease control policies."

The mathematical models used in this study show that different herd outbreaks were usually characterised by genetically distinct groups of bacteria, while bacteria from within single outbreaks were usually closely related, highlighting the potential to use next-generation sequencing to track the spread of the bacteria from herd to herd.

Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an important disease of both livestock and wildlife with severe impacts on animal health and subsequent economic consequences. Although the disease in cattle is caused by different bacteria than in human disease (_Mycobacterium bovis_ rather than _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_), _M. bovis_ is believed to have been a major historical contributor to human cases of TB worldwide and remains a health concern in both high- and low-income countries.

The study is published today [30 Nov 2012] in the journal 'PLOS Pathogens'.

PLoS Pathog 8(11): e1003008. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1003008. Available at http://www.plospathogens.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.ppat.1003008.

The authors' summary reads:
"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) offers the potential for unprecedented insight into infectious diseases spread at the individual-to-individual level. However, this potential can be compromised when a poorly sampled 'reservoir' population contributes to transmission, as strong biases in the obtained data are inevitable. Therefore WGS data must be corroborated with epidemiological data in well-described systems, in order to enhance our confidence in their broader use. The epidemic of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in British and Irish cattle has both economic and animal health importance; it also involves a management host (the cattle) whose demographic history is exceptionally well-documented, and with a reservoir host (the badgers) whose role in bTB spread has defied decades of study and observation. Here, we show that the observed spatial patterns provide a good match to M. bovis WGS data, but cattle movement networks and within-herd transmission patterns generated by mathematical models do not. Thus WGS offers considerable promise for revealing basic principles about bTB maintenance in British cattle and the role of badgers, as well as suggesting that similar approaches combining mathematical models and WGS data could be useful for the study of human TB and other infectious diseases where sampling biases are known to exist." - Mod.AS
