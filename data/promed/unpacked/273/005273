CDC collaborated with public health officials in multiple states and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Enteritidis infections which was associated with eating food from a Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain, Restaurant Chain A. Investigative efforts were unable to identify a specific food associated with illness, but data indicate that contamination likely occurred before the product reached Restaurant Chain A locations. This outbreak now appears to be over.

A widely distributed contaminated food product might cause illnesses in a specific region and across the USA. As of 19 Jan 2012, a total of 68 individuals infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Enteritidis have been reported from 10 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state with the outbreak strain was as follows: Texas (43), Oklahoma (16), Kansas (2), Iowa (1), Michigan (1), Missouri (1), Nebraska (1), New Mexico (1), Ohio (1), and Tennessee (1). Among persons for whom information was available, illnesses began on or after 13 Oct 2011. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 to 79 years, and the median age was 25 years old. 54 percent of patients were female. 31 percent of patients were hospitalized. No deaths were reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Collaborative investigative efforts of state, local, and federal public health agencies indicated that eating food from a Mexican-style fast food restaurant chain, Restaurant Chain A, was associated with some illnesses. Public health officials in multiple states and CDC conducted interviews with ill persons to ask questions about exposures during the days before becoming ill. Among 52 ill persons for whom information is available, 60 percent reported eating at Restaurant Chain A in the week before illness onset. Ill persons reported eating at 18 different locations of Restaurant Chain A in the week before becoming ill. A total of 3 locations were identified where more than 1 ill person reported eating in the week before becoming ill. This finding indicates that contamination likely occurred before the product reached Restaurant Chain A locations.

CDC and public health officials in multiple states conducted an epidemiologic study by comparing foods eaten by 48 ill and 103 well persons. Analysis of this study indicates that eating at Mexican-style fast food Restaurant Chain A was associated with illness. Ill persons (62 percent) were significantly more likely than well persons (17 percent) to report eating at Restaurant Chain A in the week before illness. No specific food item or ingredient was found to be associated with illness due to common ingredients being used together in many menu items. However, among ill persons eating at Restaurant Chain A, 90 percent reported eating lettuce, 94 percent reported eating ground beef, 77 percent reported eating cheese, and 35 percent reported eating tomatoes. The epidemic curve seen in the outbreak is consistent with those observed in past produce-related outbreaks -- with a sharp increase and decline of ill persons that spanned 1 to 2 months. Ground beef was an unlikely source due to the handling and cooking processes used by Restaurant Chain A.

FDA used information on supply truck delivery routes and schedules to try to identify potential foods associated with reports of illness. FDA collected and analyzed paper and electronic shipping records of suspected foods and various other food products shipped by a food distribution center to Restaurant Chain A locations. After reviewing these records, FDA found locations where more than one ill person reported eating in the week before becoming ill were on 2 separate trucking routes. Comparison of records from suspected foods received by these locations revealed no commonalities across a variety of suppliers. Despite these additional efforts, no further information was available to assist in identifying a single food item.

Restaurant Chain A, as well as their food suppliers and distributors, were very cooperative in providing extensive information to public health officials as various leads were explored.

This particular outbreak appears to be over. However, salmonellosis is still an important cause of human illness in the USA.
