A resurgence of a variant of foot-and-mouth disease is threatening
China's pig supply and underpinning pork prices, a senior industry
analyst with Rabobank Group said.

The disease, which affects most parts of the world that have major
animal husbandry industries, creates the risk of pork prices
continuing to keep food costs elevated at a time when Beijing is
seeking to combat high consumer-price inflation.

"Hog inventories have risen a bit, but disease is quite serious,"
Chenjun Pan said. "From the industry, we know the disease is coming
back, and it might worsen depending on the weather change and the
vaccination and sanitary measures taken by the farmers."

Average wholesale fresh pork prices tracked by the Ministry of
Commerce have fallen 3.7 percent this week since reaching a record CNY
26.44 [USD 4.16] a kg in mid-September 2011.

However, October 2011 prices are still up about 45 percent on year,
suggesting the hog supply hasn't significantly improved, Pan said.

"In the 2nd half of the year [2011], foot-and-mouth disease will
continue to be prevalent, especially in pig populations that were
already affected last year [2010]," the Hunan Province Pig Production
Technique System, a provincial-level think tank, said in a report
widely carried among industry websites last week. Hunan is China's
major pig-producing province.

Chinese veterinary authorities reported an outbreak of the disease in
Ningxia Autonomous Region last week to the World Organisation for
Animal Health [OIE].

China also reported an outbreak among swine, sheep, cattle and goats
in Guizhou province in July 2011 and among pigs in Xinjiang Uighur
Autonomous Region in March 2011.
