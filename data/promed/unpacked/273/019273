West Africa: UN Agency Urges Vigilance Amid Ebola Outbreak in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia
"With a total of 103 suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola in Guinea, including 66 deaths, the outbreak must be watched very carefully. A lot of those cases still are only suspect cases," Gregory Hartl of the World Health Organization (WHO) told reporters in Geneva. "Local health authorities will report any number of syndromic cases that resemble Ebola but turn out not to be. So we don't expect all of these cases to end up confirmed in the end. However, on the other hand, there are probably other cases out there which we don't know of yet. So this is an extremely fluid situation."

West Africa: Ebola Presence Confirmed

Monrovia -- Health Minister Dr. Walter Gwenigale ... explained that one of the deaths reported in Foya, Lofa County last week was confirmed by the tests from France as positive for the Ebola virus. Said Dr. Gwenigale: "The lady who died from Foya was a result of Ebola and the woman taking care of her is still alive. However, she left Foya to come down to Firestone to her husband. We have searched and found her and has already instructed Dr. Mabande, the Medical Administrator at the Firestone Hospital to isolate her from people."
Dr. Gwenigale explained that health authorities have also found the husband of the [deceased] lady and that the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, USA has been notified. [This statement has been misunderstood by a blogger to mean that the husband has flown to the USA. That is untrue. - Mod.JW]

The confirmation comes as Liberia struggles in dealing with the anxiety associated with the reported outbreak of the deadly Ebola Virus in Guinea and its subsequent spreading to Liberia with over 8 cases reported by health authorities, which by the end of last week had vanished.*

As of 26 Mar 2014, the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare announced that there were no new suspected cases of the viral hemorrhagic fever and that the number of suspected cases remains at 6 with 4 deaths since 24 Mar 2014. While the ministry is frantically trying to convince the Liberian Public that there are no confirmed cases of Ebola [that were infected] in Liberia, the Legislature is pushing ahead with an estimated budgetary allotment to fight the disease. Dr. Peter Coleman, former Minister of Health and Social and head of the Senate Committee told members of the Senate last week that an amount of US$1.2 million is needed to help prevent the virus. Dr. Coleman also informed his colleagues that donors have expressed willingness to provide funding to Liberia to fight the virus but wants the Government to take the lead.

Senator Coleman asserts that "We will be getting support from the European Union (EU) in the next few days to help curtail spread of this virus, so for us as a government ... it is important that some initial funding of this US$ 1.2 million be made available to the Health Ministry from the national budget. Our donors are eager to see what we as a government will do 1st", he added. "The first step should be the temporary closure of our border with Guinea. Do not rely solely on the usual border guards at those border crossings; they could compromise the enforcement because of relationships with people on the other side of the border. I have visited many of our border crossings with Guinea so I know what I am talking about. If our border with Guinea remains open during this time, no amount money will protect our people from this virus. Please Liberia, let's be sovereign and independent for once," said David Benitoe of George Mason University, on FrontPageAfricaonline.

But doctors have warned that the best way out is prevention and the virus now fast spreading in a porous and poor health care delivery system West African sub region and for people like Dr. Coleman, US$ 1.2M is not too much to give. The European Commission on Friday [28 Mar 2014] in a release issued in Brussels confirmed it is giving 500 000 Euros to help contain the spread of the deadly virus in Guinea and neighbouring countries, which include Liberia. The EU said it has also sent a health expert to Guinea to help assess the situation and liaise with the local authorities. The Commission stated that the funding will be used by the its humanitarian partner organization Medecins Sans Fronti√®res for clinical management, including the isolation of patients and psychosocial support, the tracing of suspected cases as well as the training and supply of personal protective equipment for health workers. It also disclosed that there will be community-based awareness raising initiatives so as to help diminish the risk of the further spread of the virus.

"The EU is following closely how the situation develops with its Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). It is also working with international partners, notably the World Health Organization (WHO), to track the outbreak," the Commission stated in its press release.

Ebola haemorrhagic fever in Liberia
30 March 2014. The Ministry of Health (MoH) of Liberia has provided updated details on the suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola haemorrhagic fever (EHF) in Liberia. As of 29 March, seven clinical samples, all from adult patients from Foya district, Lofa County, have been tested by PCR using Ebola Zaire virus primers by the mobile laboratory of the Institut Pasteur (IP) Dakar in Conakry. Two of those samples have tested positive for the ebolavirus. There have been 2 deaths among the suspected cases; a 35 year-old woman who died on 21 March tested positive for ebolavirus while a male patient who died on 27 March tested negative. Foya remains the only district in Liberia that has reported confirmed or suspected cases of EHF. As of 26 March, Liberia had 27 contacts under medical follow-up.
In accordance with the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the MoH of Liberia is communicating regularly with WHO and neighbouring countries to help coordinate and harmonise surveillance, prevention and control activities."

Ebola death toll hits 82 as doctors warn West Africa outbreak is 'unprecedented'
-------------------------------------------------
New cases confirmed as virus that kills 90 per cent of infected people spreads from Guinea to Liberia with suspected cases in Sierra Leone
The Ebola epidemic confirmed by the Ministry of Health is the 1st to affect Guinea. The priority of the teams on site is to identify patients with Ebola symptoms and isolate them, while providing high-quality care.

An outbreak of Ebola haemorrhagic fever that doctors on Monday described as "unprecedented" has spread to three countries in West Africa and threatens to become one of the deadliest in years.

At least 82 people have already died in Guinea and Liberia, and another 56 patients are suspected to be carrying the virus. Many others could be infected and not yet know it because Ebola can take up to 3 weeks to show symptoms, before killing very quickly from uncontrollable internal and external bleeding; 9 in 10 of those infected die.

The areas where it has so far been found include Conakry, Guinea's capital, with 2 million inhabitants, and heavily populated parts of the country's borderlands with Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The epidemic was "unprecedented" and "of a magnitude never before seen" ** in terms of its spread across Guinea and its neighbours, said Mariano Lugli, project coordinator for Medecins Sans Frontieres in Conakry.

[* In Liberia "over 8 cases reported by health authorities, which by the end of last week had vanished." It is not all clear what this means.

** "... of a magnitude never before seen". But the 1976 outbreak in Zaire had a final toll of 280 deaths:

"Between 1 September and 24 October 1976, 318 cases of acute viral haemorrhagic fever occurred in northern Zaire. The outbreak was centred in the Bumba Zone of the Equateur Region and most of the cases were recorded within a radius of 70 km of Yambuku, although a few patients sought medical attention in Bumba, Abumombazi, and the capital city of Kinshasa, where individual secondary and tertiary cases occurred. There were 280 deaths, and only 38 serologically confirmed survivors."

Macenta to Conakry 475km
Foya to Monrovia 450km.
