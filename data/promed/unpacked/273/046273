Cambodia says it dealt with new outbreaks of bird flu
----------------------------------------------------
2 more bird flu outbreaks were detected last month [March 2004] in chickens
in Cambodia but the infections have been cleaned up, the Department of
Animal Health and Production said.
Department head Kao Phal said a team of experts from his department and the
UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) were still undertaking
inspections of poultry countrywide to ensure the spread of the deadly
pathogen had halted.
"We have now recorded a total of 12 outbreaks of bird flu," he said Monday,
adding that the 2 latest cases occurred in northeastern Kampong Cham and
southern Takeo provinces, both bordering Viet Nam.
Bird flu has swept through 10 countries in Asia, killing 16 people in Viet
Nam and 8 in Thailand, which also shares a boundary with Cambodia. 7
Cambodians have been tested for the disease but all have been cleared.
Kao Phal said the chickens infected by the deadly H5N1 virus -- which has
wreaked havoc throughout Asia's poultry industries as millions of birds
have been culled -- were kept by people in their homes.
"We cannot declare our country free of bird flu at this time. We need more
time to carry out a survey" now taking place with assistance of the FAO, he
said. "We still have more work to do."
Officially, declarations that a country is bird flu-free can only be made
by the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] after a 21-day
surveillance period with no new outbreaks. [This is an erroneous statement;
see comment.- Mod.AS]
But Kao Phal said last month [in March 2004] that Cambodia would wait at
least 40 days from an outbreak to make such an announcement.
Experts in Cambodia suspect that the disease has been more widespread here
than reported, due to the country's location between Viet Nam and Thailand
and limited resources for testing.

[2 official notifications on HPAI in Cambodia have been received by the OIE
so far. The first one was received on 24 Jan 2004, reporting one outbreak
in a layer flock of 7000 chickens, of which 3300 died (though "stamping
out" was mentioned, the report indicates "0" as to the number of destroyed
or slaughtered animals). On 17 Mar 2004, Dr Sorn San, Chief of National
Animal Health and Production Investigation Center, Phnom Penh, informed the
OIE about 9 additional outbreaks, recorded in 3 local chicken farms, 3
layer farms, 2 broiler farms, 1 duck flock and 1 wildlife rescue centre
(zoo) with raptors, herons, crows, etc. The total Number of cases was
4799; 6125 animals were destroyed.

It seems thus that the 2 last cases mentioned in the current posting were
recorded later than 17 Mar 2004.
Regarding the statement that "Cambodia would wait at least 40 days from an
outbreak" before declaring to be a "bird flu-free country": similarly
erroneous statements have been published recently by other HPAI-affected
countries, and ProMED-mail has commented accordingly (see updates 42, 43,
46, 49, 51, references below). In view of the current statement, a detailed
reminder from OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code - 2003, seems to be in
place.
Article 2.1.14.2., HPAI free country: "A country may be considered free
from HPAI when it has been shown that HPAI has not been present for at
least the past 3 years. This period shall be 6 months after the slaughter
of the last affected animal for countries in which a stamping-out policy is
practised with or without vaccination against HPAI".
Article 2.1.14.3., HPAI infected zone: "A zone shall be considered as
infected with HPAI until:
1) at least 21 days have elapsed after the confirmation of the last case
and the completion of a stamping-out policy and disinfection procedures, or
2) 6 months have elapsed after the clinical recovery or death of the last
affected animal if a stamping-out policy was not practised".
Clearly, countries found infected with HPAI will be able to be declared
free only 6 months after the last outbreak, provided stamping-out policy
was implemented; otherwise, it will take 3 years. On the other hand, zones
within affected countries can be regarded as not infected much earlier,
under the specified requirements. - Mod.AS]
