Five swans, a wild duck and a wild goose were found dead in Nuremberg
[also spelled Nurnberg, in the German state of Bavaria; see map at
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?action=showmap&country=164_9008_5&language=1>]
and were identified as infected with avian influenza.

The city immediately announced a restricted area. It remains to be
confirmed whether the virus involved is H5N1, which can infect humans.

The dead birds were sent to the national reference laboratory at the
Friedrich Loeffler Institute, on the island of Riems, which will
perform the final identification of the virus.

The city declared a restricted area with a radius of 4 km. No poultry
or other birds may be transported into or out of that area for 21
days. Dog and cats may not wander in the restricted area. In the area
where the birds were found, warnings were set up.

Authorities in Bavaria say 7 dead birds found in 2 lakes near
Nuremburg have tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus, the 1st
cases in Germany this year [2007]. People have been warned to keep
their dogs on a leash and to steer clear of waterfowl.

Additional tests on the 5 swans, one duck and one goose are underway
with the results expected within a few days. In 2006, 13 European
Union countries were hit by bird flu, and earlier this month [June
2007], cases were reported in the Czech Republic. The H5N1 strain has
decimated poultry stocks since 2003 and killed as many as 191 people
worldwide.

EU: deadly bird flu strain confirmed in Germany

The highly pathogenic bird flu virus H5N1 has been found in two dead
swans in Germany, the European Commission said on Sunday.

The European Union executive said German authorities had informed Brussels
that laboratory tests carried out at a regional laboratory in Bavaria had
confirmed the deadly strain in the birds.

Precautionary measures were now being taken, the Commission said in a
statement.

[Germany's last outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was notified to the OIE on 7 Apr
2006 [last year]; it referred to a turkey farm in the Sachsen state.
Contact with wild birds was reportedly suspected; see at
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/AIS_23.HTM#Sec1>.
The outbreak was eradicated by stamping out, and on 18 Jul 2006,
Germany officially announced its regained freedom of HPAI as from 28
Jul 2006, in accordance with Chapter 2.7.12. of OIE's Terrestrial
Animal Health Code.

During 2006, H5N1 was detected in wild birds in several European
countries, including Germany; see map at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/map/20060802/europe.htm>
and graphs showing the results of the undertaken surveillance,
including number of cases per week, per species and per country at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_wildbirds2006.pdf>.
The last positive bird was detected on 2 Aug 2006.

The surveillance has been continued throughout 2006 and during 2007,
with negative results. A graph, updated 21 Jun 2007, is available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/adns/adns_wildbirds2007.pdf>.

Final results from the OIE's Reference Laboratory for highly
pathogenic avian influenza and low pathogenic avian influenza at the
Federal Research Centre for Virus Diseases of Animals (BFAV),
Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Insel Riems, are expected soon. -
