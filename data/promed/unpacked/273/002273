Report of 2 EHV-1 myelopathy outbreaks
--------------------------------------
We are currently advising in 2 outbreaks of EHV-1 infection (Equid Herpesvirus-1) with cases of myelopathy (EHM) in the wider Munich area (Munich is the capital of Bavaria in the South of Germany).

The 2 outbreaks are likely not inter-related; no common denominator. The distance between the 2 is 80 km [approx. 50 mi]; one outbreak is in the southwest of Munich, the other in the west of Munich.

Both outbreaks are in riding boarding facilities with a mixed horse population; however, they are predominantly composed of warmbloods. In either facility there are febrile horses, ataxic horses, and at least 2 horses in each facility have been euthanized due to quadriplegia.

EHV-1 diagnosis has been established via nasal swab qPCR on several occasions.

Both facilities are under voluntary quarantine as EHV-1 is not a reportable disease in Germany.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Prof Goehring for the above firsthand information.

Equine rhinopneumonitis (ER) is a collective term for any one of several contagious, clinical disease entities of equids that may occur as a result of infection by either of 2 closely related herpesviruses, equid herpesvirus-1 and -4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4). Infection with EHV-1 is listed by the OIE. EHV-1 and EHV-4 are endemic in most domestic equine populations worldwide.

Primary infection by either EHV-1 or EHV-4 is characterised by upper respiratory tract disease of varying severity that is related to the age and immunological status of the infected animal. EHV-1 also causes the more serious complications of abortion, perinatal foal death, or paralytic neurological disease (equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy). EHV-4 has been associated with sporadic cases of abortion, but not the large outbreaks associated with EHV-1. Like other herpesviruses, EHV-1 and 4 induce long-lasting latent infections and can be reactivated following stress or pregnancy. Most horses are likely to be re-infected multiple times during their lifetime, often mildly or subclinically.

Detection of viral DNA or anti-EHV antibodies should therefore be interpreted with care.

The above and exhaustive additional information on the disease, its diagnosis and vaccines, is available in chapter 2.5.9. of OIE's Manual of terrestrial animal diseases, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/fr/Health_standards/tahm/2.05.09_EQUINE_RHINO.pdf (Version adopted in May 2017). Both live attenuated and inactivated viral vaccines are available for EHV1/4.

Until 2014, the disease was reported to the OIE as Equine Rhinopneumonitis, but since then, it is reported as Equid herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

According to OIE's "disease distribution map" for "infection with equid herpesvirus-1" (most recent year available, 2017) the disease was reported from most European countries, including Germany. Map at https://tinyurl.com/y9gb3vah (click on central Europe, zoom in).

This is not a zoonotic disease. - Mod.AS
