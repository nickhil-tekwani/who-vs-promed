[Since the start of the current NCD epizootic in Israel, 22 Sep 2011, a total of 68 outbreaks have been reported to the OIE, located in several parts of the country (interactive map at http://tinyurl.com/clxhd25). The total accumulated number of destroyed (and compensated) birds is nearly 2.3 million. The economic losses are considerable, amounting (in US dollars) to 8 digit figures. This, in spite of the stamping-out policy, compulsory general vaccinations, intensive surveillance and other severe control measures reportedly applied. - Mod.AS.]
