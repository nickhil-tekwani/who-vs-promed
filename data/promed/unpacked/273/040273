[1] 3rd case
- Fri 12 Feb 2021. WHO races to contain Ebola in the DRC as it confirms a 3rd case
[CNBC, abridged, edited]

The World Health Organization on Friday [12 Feb 2021] confirmed a 3rd case of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo as health officials race to vaccinate residents and contain the potential outbreak.

Earlier this week, the global health agency confirmed that a woman died of the disease in Butembo, a city in North Kivu province and an epicenter of a previous Ebola outbreak that was declared over in June [2020]. The WHO has since confirmed 2 more cases, including another person who has died, Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program, said Friday [12 Feb 2021].

The number of people who might have been exposed to the virus has risen from over 70 on Monday [8 Feb 2021] to 182 as of Friday [12 Feb 2021], Ryan said. He added that all but 3 of those people have been contacted, and more than half of them were previously vaccinated against Ebola during prior outbreaks.

"We're seeing some benefits of the previous vaccination, but obviously we have to look at the length of time that vaccine protects," he said.

He added that new shipments of vaccine arrived in Butembo this week. Ultracold-chain storage equipment is being set up in Butembo, and personnel are being trained, Ryan said.

The DRC also has other therapeutics, including Ebola monoclonal antibody treatments, in the capital, Kinshasa, and another city, Mbandaka, Ryan said, adding that they will be airlifted into North Kivu over the weekend. The DRC has enough vaccine for 16 000 people in the country, Ryan said, but it's not clear how much has arrived in Butembo.

The WHO is "still unclear around the original community source" of the 1st Ebola case, Ryan said, adding that the DRC's National Institute of Biomedical Research is sequencing samples of the virus at its main lab in Kinshasa to determine whether the new cases are associated with the last Butembo outbreak. Ryan said results are expected over the weekend.

The Ebola outbreak that was declared over in June [2020] lasted for nearly 2 years. It was the 2nd-largest in the world, and by the time it ended, there were 3481 total cases and 2299 deaths, according to the WHO.

The WHO noted that outbreak response efforts in North Kivu province have been especially difficult because of ongoing violent conflicts in the area, which is occupied by over 100 different armed groups, according to Human Rights Watch.

Ryan said the WHO is working with nongovernmental organizations, the DRC government, and other United Nations agencies, such as UNICEF, to respond to the new Ebola cases.

Unlike the highly infectious coronavirus, which can be spread by people who don't have symptoms, Ebola is thought to mainly spread through people who are already visibly sick. The virus spreads through direct contact with the blood or body fluids of people who are sick or who died of the disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Ebola has an average case fatality rate of 50%, though it can vary by outbreak, according to the WHO.

"Obviously, 2 cases and now a 3rd may not seem like many, many cases in the light of what we see globally with COVID, but we've been on the alert waiting for the return of Ebola in eastern Congo, and we'll do everything in our power to support the government in the response," Ryan said.

[The 1st case visited 3 healthcare clinics in 2 health zones, placing others at risk in those facilities/locations. And to further exacerbate control of spread, proper burial protocol was not practiced. But according to Dr. Ryan, Executive Director, WHO Health Emergencies Programme, fortuitously more than half of the identified contacts have been vaccinated. The question was posed in Ebola update (06) Congo DR (NK) WHO, 2nd fatal case 20210212.8186694 inquiring whether the index case, who may have become infected by her husband, a survivor, had been vaccinated.

The current state of the 3rd patient and his/her exact location are not stated in any report.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo has confirmed a 3rd Ebola case this week in North Kivu province, provincial health minister Eugene Nzanzu Salita has said.

The case was found in Butembo, a city of more than one million people and the epicentre of a major outbreak of the disease that was declared over last June [2020] after nearly 2 years.

"We are in a meeting to gather all the information on the investigations done around this case," Salita said on Friday [12 Feb 2021].

Congo's health ministry announced a resurgence of the disease on 7 Feb [2021] after a woman contracted Ebola and died. She was married to a survivor of the previous outbreak.

Two people have died from Ebola this week in North Kivu.

On Friday [12 Feb 2021], 1200 doses of Ebola vaccine and cold chain equipment arrived in Butembo, the health ministry and the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement.

Health workers are training vaccinators and tracing more than 100 contacts in the districts of Biena and Katwa, the statement said.

A new outbreak would be Congo's 12th since the virus was first discovered near the Ebola River in 1976.

Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, said on Thursday [11 Feb 2021] during a briefing that the UN health body was working in coordination with the DRC's government to prevent the spread of the disease.

The 1st 2 Ebola cases were detected nearly 3 months after the DRC announced the end of its 11th outbreak hundreds of kilometres away in the northwestern province of Equateur, which infected 130 people and killed 55.

That outbreak overlapped with an earlier one in the east running from 1 Aug 2018 to 25 Jun 2020 that killed more than 2200 people, the 2nd most in the disease's history and the deadliest in the DRC. The last person declared recovered from Ebola in Equateur was on 16 Oct [2020]. The widespread use of Ebola vaccinations, which were administered to more than 40 000 people, helped curb the disease.

Over the past year, 2 Ebola vaccines have been approved and distributed, including one from drug company Johnson & Johnson, which has also produced a COVID-19 vaccine that will only require one shot and can be stored at regular refrigeration temperatures.

The emergence of more Ebola cases could complicate efforts to eradicate COVID-19, which has infected 23 600 people and killed 681 in the DRC.

A COVID vaccination campaign is expected to start in the 1st half of this year [2021].

Peter Piot, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicines, said during the WHO briefing that there are no reasons preventing the distribution and administration of vaccines effective for both Ebola and COVID-19.

[While Dr. Piot feels confident vaccine can be distributed and administered without a problem, others have expressed concern. "An outbreak of such a highly contagious disease, in a region already experiencing mass people movements due to violent spikes of conflict that have recently affected nearly 26 000 families, is worrisome," says World Vision's National Director Anne-Marie Connor (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/ebola-outbreak-3rd-confirmed-case-reported-in-a-week-80508/). - Mod.LK]

In its latest report on the epidemiological situation of the 12th epidemic of the Ebola virus disease published this Friday, 12 Feb 2021, the provincial ministry of health in North Kivu reports that 1200 doses of vaccines have already been deployed in the city of Butembo to curb the spread of the epidemic.

The ministry indicates in the wake that these vaccines have already been received in Butembo, as has cold chain equipment that will keep the product at the recommended temperature.

In addition, the same source specifies that no other confirmed case has been reported on 11 Feb [2021], and already 180 contacts of the 1st 2 cases have been listed and 129 have been followed, for a follow-up rate of 72%.
