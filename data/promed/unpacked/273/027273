A pair of outbreaks of pseudotuberculosis [_Yersinia
pseudotuberculosis_ - Mod.LL] are being investigated by the office of
Nikolayevsk-na-Amure of Khabarovsk region.
A total of 16 people including 13 disabled children were admitted to
the central district hospital, infectious diseases department from a
psychoneurological hostel with the diagnosis of "Far-Eastern
scarlatine fever" (pseudotuberculosis) during the period of 19 to 21
Jul 2007. Sanitary violations were found in the hostel. For example,
food chopping took place in storehouse that was not designed for that
purposes. The laboratory tests of the samples taken from the hostel
have shown presence of pseudotuberculosis.
The 2nd cluster involved 30 people, including 17 children that were
resting in summer camp. The camp is currently closed for quarantine
due to sanitary hygienic violations.

[The manifestations of illness in these cases are not stated.
Infection with _Yersinia pseudotuberculosis_ is a zoonosis with
reservoirs in many animals, including rodents, rabbits, deer, and
various birds.
Most individuals affected are children or young adults. The most
common presentation of this infection is mesenteric lymphadenitis,
with fever and right lower quadrant abdominal pain, which can be
confused with acute appendicitis. A febrile gastroenteritis may also
occur, which has been described as Izumi syndrome in Japan. Late
complications may be a reactive arthritis or erythema nodosum.
Cutaneous manifestations of yersiniosis include the above-mentioned
erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme as well. Both of these can
be found with a variety of infectious stimuli. Erythema nodosum
presents as painful, indurated erythematous circular lesions, usually
on the shins.
Erythema multiforme, as the name implies, results in multi-form
lesions including classical target-like lesions. Weber (1) describes
erythema multiforme in yersiniosis that tends to coalesce into
plaques with a vesicular component in its periphery. This may also be
associated with conjunctivitis. Scarlet fever-like rashes
(Far-Eastern scarlatine fever) with erythroderma and subsequent
desquamation can also occur. This manifestation can also resemble
Kawasaki syndrome (2).
Although many associations had been previously made, one of the
strongest studies of the relationship of _Y. pseudotuberculosis_ and
food was published in 2004 from Finland (3). The editorial commentary
(4) with the paper is a nicely presented discussion on the hazards of
infections associated with fresh produce. The diagnosis of infection
with this bacterium can be made by isolation of the organism from
lymph node or stool. Serological tests can be helpful, but
cross-reactions are found between yersiniae and other enteric
organisms, including some salmonellae.
Khabarovsk is an area in eastern Russia. Its capital city (also
Khabarovsk) is located some 30 km [18.64 miles] from the Chinese
border and is the 2nd largest city in the Russian Far East, after
Vladivostok. Its location can be found on a map at:
