IBP-Lakeside Ground Beef Products May Contain Dangerous Bacteria
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is asking consumers not to
consume any type of ground beef products produced at the Lakeside
facility in Brooks, Alberta on 1 Mar 2001, because they may contain
_Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 bacteria.
The product was sold to various outlets in Canada. The company is in
the process of contacting all affected customers who received any of
these products. Although the likelihood of any remaining affected
products being sold at the retail level is limited, some consumers may
have stored such products in their freezers. For this reason, the CFIA
is asking consumers not to consume ground beef products purchased at
affected retail outlets bearing dates on or between 1 Mar 2001 and 18
Mar 2001.
There have been cases of reported illness in Saskatchewan which have
been linked to this product. Consumers should inquire at the retailer
where they purchase their ground beef to verify if the store has
received any of the products.
_E.coli_ O157:H7 may cause life-threatening illness by producing a
toxin that breaks down the lining of the intestines and damages the
kidneys. Food contaminated with _E.coli_ bacteria will *not* look or
smell spoiled. This product should not be consumed. Consumers are
reminded to cook all ground beef products to a minimum of 71 degrees C
or 160 degrees F.
Retailers and distributors should verify if they have received the
affected product. The CFIA is continuing with the investigation.
Based on the current information from Lakeside Packers, the following
retailers and distributors are in receipt of the affected products:
Store Affiliation / Location and Province
Costco Wholesale / British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan,
& the Brampton, Ontario.
Western Grocers / British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba,
Ontario
National Grocers / Ontario & New Brunswick
Sobey's and affiliated outlets / National
