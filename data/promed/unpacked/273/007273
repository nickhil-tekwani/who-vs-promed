Pakistan's prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, said on Sat 14 Aug 2010 that
20 million people had been affected by the worst floods in the country's
history as the United Nations confirmed the 1st cholera case.

Independence day celebrations were cancelled as floods continued to bring
misery to millions and aid agencies warned of a "second wave" of deaths
from disease.

"The floods affected some 20 million people, destroyed standing crops and
food storages worth billions of dollars, causing colossal loss to national
economy," Gilani said in a televised address to the nation.

UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, was due to arrive in Pakistan on Sunday
[15 Aug 2010] to discuss the relief effort and visit flood-hit areas.

"Outbreak of epidemics in the flood-hit areas is a serious threat, which
can further compound the already grave situation," Gilani added, as the UN
confirmed the country's 1st cholera case in Mingora, the main town in the
north western district of Swat.

Maurizio Giuliano, spokesman for the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs,
said at least 36 000 people were reportedly suffering from acute watery
diarrhea (AWD). "We're not suggesting that everyone who has acute watery
diarrhea has cholera, but cholera is certainly a concern and that's why
we're stepping up our efforts to treat cholera," he said.

Arif Mehmood, Pakistan's chief meteorological official, said no new wave of
flooding was expected to hit any river in the next couple of days.
Charities said relief for those affected by the worst natural disaster in
Pakistan's history was lagging far behind what was needed.

[It was inevitable that _Vibrio cholerae_ infection would be found in the
aftermath of the horrendous flooding in western Pakistan. How many of the
36 000 cases of AWD is cholera is not clear but it is not just one. - Mod.LL
