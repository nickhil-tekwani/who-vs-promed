With regard to this reported Minamata-like epidemic in Brazil, I would be
curious to know if fish-eating animals in the area such as domestic and
wild cats, showed similar clinical signs, but at an earlier date than the
affected humans. In the original Minamata episode in Japan, domestic cats
showed classical signs of mercury toxicity well before the disease was
recognized and reported in humans. This was a great example of how
domestic animals could have provided an early warning of an environmental
hazard for humans, but where the opportunity was missed. Isn't it about
time we recognized and relied on animals as natural sentinels? It has been
a long time since the canary was carried into the mine to detect toxic
gasses, but we still do not seem to have learned from their experience. I
refer readers to a monograph published by the National Academy Press
(Washington DC) in 1991 titled "Animals as Sentinels of Environmental
Health Hazards". On pages 22-28 (Table 1-1) it lists "Selected
Environmental Toxicants First Identified in Animals". Included is
reference to Minamata bay.

Could we have some clarification on the report of Minamata disease in Brazil:
1. On the source of the sample (hair vs. blood) for mercury on the three
affected patients? While hair mercury levels are often used to assess
long-term exposure to mercury in population surveys, the evaluation of
patients with clinical disease is generally done with blood samples (the
numbers reported would be astronomical for blood samples). Were blood
samples done, and what were the levels found?
2. While Minamata disease has pathognomonic features when severe, in milder
cases the signs and symptoms seen are also consistent with several other
neurologic disorders. To what extent could those be ruled out?
3. Just how far away are these patients from the mercury source, and what
are the levels of methylmercury being found in Amazon fish (the presumed
route of exposure)?
