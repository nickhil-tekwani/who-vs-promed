A 2nd cow is to be incinerated on the Westbury farm where anthrax was detected, government officials have confirmed. The cow is not strictly confirmed as carrying the deadly disease, and the authorities will wait for test results to confirm, but they said the development was "not unexpected."

Last Friday, a cow tested positive for anthrax and was incinerated on the farm, which is to the west of Westbury in Wiltshire, and a 2nd case has not caused an increase in the warnings to public health. The case, at Storridge Farm, caused the farm to be placed in movement restrictions and a mile-long footpath along the western edge of Westbury was closed off to the public to minimise the risk.

Farmers and farm workers on the site that came into contact with the herd are being monitored.

It is understood the farm is the site of an anthrax case in 1996, which was linked at the time with a former leather works nearby.

A spokesman for the Animal and Plant Health Agency said the case was not a surprise. "It is in the same farm, with the same herd from the same pasture, so it is not unexpected. The movement restrictions on the farm and for the public around remain in place, and our work there will continue to test the rest of the herd," he said.

"A 2nd cow has died at the farm, and tests are still being carried out. This development is not unexpected. The cow will be incinerated, and movement will continue to be restricted at the farm as we continue to follow the necessary procedures for dealing with this incident.

"We continue to work with our colleagues from Defra, Environment Agency and Wiltshire Council to investigate this case and closely monitor the welfare of the animals. Movement restrictions remain in place on the farm. The risk of infection in close human contacts of the animal is very low, and we continue to work with PHE to monitor potential human contacts."

Fears of an outbreak of anthrax caused by spores that have lain dormant for decades are delaying the start of a major housing development. Spores of the anthrax bacteria, lying inert in the soil, are thought to have been disturbed by ditch-dredging work on Storridge Farm, near Westbury in Wiltshire, where 3 cattle have died of the disease since early June [1996].

Anthrax is one of the deadliest and oldest diseases known to humans. It can infect human beings as well as livestock and, although it is extremely rare in Britain, in its most severe form, it is nearly always fatal if not treated promptly with antibiotics.

Local people fear that the spores might have been carried along a stream from an abandoned leather works on the outskirts of Westbury, where infected hides are said to have been buried in the past. The farm is about a 1.5 miles downstream from the works. The former tannery is on a 50-acre site, mostly now farmland, that has been earmarked for development. West Wiltshire District Council is considering a proposal to build 800 homes, a superstore, and a primary school.

Alison Irving, a Liberal Democrat councillor who lives near the old tannery, said: "Local residents are worried that once construction workers start disturbing the site, they could release anthrax spores that have been lying dormant up to now." Concern voiced by Mrs Irving led the council's planning committee to defer a decision on the housing scheme and to ask Persimmon Homes, the development company, to analyse soil and water at the site.

David Bardwell, the council's principal environmental officer, said: "We are aware of the site's history, and we need to be sure that it is safe for development." He added: "The developers need to be satisfied, too, because their employees would be most at risk." The managing director of Persimmon Homes, Clive Drinkwater, said: "We are in the process of appointing consultants to investigate and report back on the condition of the land. We will then agree with the local authority any work which may need to be undertaken."

There is pressure to develop the site as the council has been allocated 11 000 of the 65 000 houses that the Department of the Environment says Wiltshire must provide by 2011. It is government policy to develop old industrial sites where possible.

The leather works, which dates from the last century and once employed 200 people, went out of business in 1983 and is a wasteland of broken-down buildings and rusting machinery. In the 1950s, a cluster of anthrax cattle deaths occurred on farms either side of Biss Brook, which runs through the former tannery. There are records showing that the owners paid farmers compensation for the animals.

Former workers at the tannery say that in the immediate postwar years, imported foreign hides often came with an anthrax warning. One who worked at the plant from 1946 to 1981 remembers 2 mild cases among employees.

Until the latest outbreak at Storridge Farm, no case of anthrax among cattle had been reported in the area for more than 20 years. It is thought the farmer may have disturbed old anthrax spores while dredging a ditch and spread them unwittingly over adjacent pasture where cattle were grazing.

Re: Anthrax Case near Westbury
-----------------------
It involves land which is some way away from the main residential parts of the town, which has now been sealed off from the public, but to stop people/the press inundating the farm with visits (which would be the opposite of what is needed) precise location information is not being circulated. The location is nowhere near the former old tannery site by Leigh Park/Westbury Leigh/ Dilton Marsh, which has an old history involving anthrax that is now buried below secure layers of fabric and additional topsoil, etc. Apparently, badgers have recently dug up the soil in the relevant field, and experts believe that this is the source. The field had a very small number of cattle in it."

For what it may be worth, until we have access to a more rigorous investigation. Dredging and mechanically clearing of contaminated stream or river beds is well recognised as a risk when one is either downstream of a tannery or where infected carcasses had lain. As tanneries routinely used contaminated hides, both domestic and imported, they have long been recognised as a potential source for anthrax outbreaks in livestock, whether in the UK, USA, Canada, India, today, wherever. How the badgers come into this is presently unclear.
