Tougher superbugs reach England
----------------------------------------------
Doctors fear that their drug defenses against hospital superbugs are
weakening after a patient was diagnosed with a new strain. Bacteria
resistant to many classes of antibiotics are rife in many UK hospitals.
However, even in the most extreme cases, doctors could turn to the
antibiotic vancomycin to clear the infection [for organisms such as
methicillin-resistant _Staph. aureus_ (MRSA) - Mod.LL].
In the latest case, the unnamed patient [in an unnamed location - Mod.LL]
developed an infection that had shown a low-level resistance even to this
class of drugs. It is the first such case in England, although there have
been vancomycin-resistant strains uncovered in Scotland, as well as in
France, Japan, and the US. An earlier scare in Bristol involved bacteria
which turned out to have insignificant resistance to the drug.
The patient involved later died, although the infection is not thought to
have been the cause. Hospital officials believe that no one else in the
building has acquired the bacteria.
"Superbugs" such as MRSA are thought to cost thousands of lives - and
hundreds of millions of pounds to the NHS each year. Poor hospital hygiene
practices are thought by many to contribute to the problem, and in July
2000, the government launched a 60-million-pound drive to improve cleanliness.
However, another key factor is the heavy use of antibiotics, particularly
in the hospital environment. Exposure to these drugs eventually leads to
the survival of strains whose genetic makeup lends itself to drug
resistance as weaker, competing strains are killed off. [Many
antimicrobial-susceptible strains are not at all necessarily weaker; in
many cases, the more resistant strain may be a weaker pathogen -Mod.LL].
Dr Georgia Duckworth, from the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS),
which monitors infectious disease in the UK, said: "With the development of
antibiotic resistance, _Staph. aureus_ infections have become harder to
treat as there are fewer antibiotics that are effective. Since the
discovery of MRSA, vancomycin has been the first choice antibiotic used in
its treatment. This first case in England is a serious development."
Scientists are racing to develop new types of antibiotics as resistant
strains of bacteria render existing drugs increasingly ineffective. New
classes of drugs have been introduced in recent years, but doctors are
still being urged to cut back on antibiotic usage wherever possible to slow
down the arrival of resistance.
Dr Duckworth said: "It underscores the fact that there is no cause for
complacency in antibiotic usage - whenever we use an antibiotic, even if
totally appropriately, we encourage the development of resistance to it."

Hospitals said to be dirtier than abattoirs
------------------------------------------------
One of Scotland's leading infections experts last night criticized hygiene
in NHS hospitals as being worse than that in slaughterhouses.
Hugh Pennington, a professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University, said
abattoirs have better facilities to prevent infection than most hospitals.
But as he spoke Scotland's health service was warned that further
improvements in cleanliness would never eradicate superbugs, and new drugs
would only buy time before they became resistant to those treatments as well.
Professor James Naismith, from St Andrews University, warned the antibiotic
vancomycin was the last line of defense against MRSA
[(methicillin-resistant _Staph. aureus_)], but the superbug was already
becoming resistant to the drug [at least less sensitive - Mod.LL].
The scientists' comments followed a survey which revealed that over half of
patients treated in NHS hospitals thought their homes were cleaner than the
wards. Prof Pennington said: "If our hospitals were kept at the level of
cleanliness that slaughterhouses currently observe, it would be a far
better deal for the patients. 10 percent of people who go into hospital
contract an infection while they're in there and all of these infections
are preventable with improved hygiene [at least a goodly number of them -
Mod.LL]. Staff who work in a modern slaughterhouse wash their hands every
5 minutes. The NHS do not always make it easy for their staff to wash their
hands when they need to. Just having more hand-wash basins and putting
them in the right place could make a huge difference."
Meanwhile, Prof Naismith issued his warning over superbugs after receiving
a GBP 637 000 grant from the Wellcome Trust for a study of the structure of
vancomycin in an effort to find new ways of fighting MRSA.

[A number of reports of MRSA demonstrating reduced susceptibility to
vancomycin have occurred since 1997 and are noted below. These isolates
called VISA (vancomycin-intermediate _Staph. aureus_) or GISA
(glycopeptide-intermediate _Staph. aureus_) have generally been isolated
from patients who have had prolonged exposure to vancomycin in a hospital
setting. Fortunately, serious life-threatening illness was not usually
associated with this infection, and high doses of vancomycin were still
effective. Many isolates of another organism (Enterococcus), however,
previously uniformly sensitive to vancomycin, have developed high-grade
resistance to the drug. Fortunately, the enterococcus is not always a
significant pathogen in people, but it would be quite problematic if such a
resistance pattern appeared in _Staph. aureus_ or _Strep. pneumoniae_ and
those organisms were virulent. A new antimicrobial, linezolid, does have
activity against the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and is active
against Staph. as well. However, only time and increasing use are needed
for linezolid-resistant strains of these organisms to become
prevalent. The 2 issues discussed in the reports, overuse of
antimicrobials (especially in the hospital setting) and inadequately
followed infection control procedures, contribute to the development and
spread of resistant strains, respectively.
Ultimately, it is not likely that we will eradicate such resistant strains,
but judicious use of antimicrobials and aggressive enforcement of
handwashing and other infection control procedures can limit the impact of
these organisms. - Mod.LL]
