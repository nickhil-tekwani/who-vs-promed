ANTHRAX, BISON - CANADA (12): (SASKATCHEWAN), NEW CASES

The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has confirmed that a 2nd
area in southern Saskatchewan has livestock infected with anthrax.
CFIA reported on 6 Aug 2010 that around 30 bison in the RM [rural
municipality] of Wellington had died as a result of anthrax
ingestion. On Wednesday [18 Aug 2010], the CFIA confirmed that a
neighboring area, the RM of Fillmore, had infected cattle as well.

The CFIA was unable to confirm a specific number of bison and cattle
infected when contacted on Thursday [19 Aug 2010].

Anthrax spores are commonly found in soil across the Canadian
prairies, and wet weather brings the spores to the surface.

According to the provincial health ministry, anthrax poses a low
health risk [for people], especially for those who don't come in
direct contact with sick animals or dead carcasses. However, humans
are susceptible to infection if an open wound comes in contact with
anthrax spores. The wound forms a blister and a skin ulcer with a black centre.

[As the usual threshold number for subsequent outbreaks is merely 4-6
adult sick cattle on the index farm, one cannot be surprised at these
new cases -- the number of ranches affected is not given, which would
suggest that it is not singular -- in the neighbouring rural
municipality (RM). This will test the effectiveness of the earlier
CFIA advisory for SK ranchers to have vaccinated their stock before
this summer's anthrax season began.

There has been an ongoing discussion to sort out why the US Navy test
did not perform better in the initial outbreak. It is claimed that it
was run on recently dead carcasses. But there is the possibility that
some out-of-date kits may have been used. Everyone else has reported
no problems.
