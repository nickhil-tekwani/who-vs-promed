[1] Query on secondary transmission
Date: Fri 17 Jun 2011
From: Michael Donnenberg [edited]

I have read little regarding secondary cases of diarrhea, bloody
diarrhea or hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) due to the current
outbreak strain of EAEC/STEC serotype O104:H4. A secondary case in
close contact with individuals with disease due to EHEC O157:H7 is one
of the defining characteristics of that serotype and is suggestive of
a low inoculum required for illness. Information regarding such cases,
especially in the latter stages of the outbreak, would be extremely
valuable.

likely that some secondary household cases have occurred as noted in

[2] Food handler contamination

German scientists have discovered a 2nd cause of the outbreak of _E.
coli_ [O104] bacterium that has killed 39 people in recent weeks: a
kitchen employee at a catering company was unwittingly spreading the
germ on food.

The finding on Fri 17 Jun 2011 comes a week after statistical and
laboratory proof that the disease was mainly spread by edible sprouts
grown from lentils, radishes and beans at a market garden.

Hesse state consumer protection officials said that a woman who had
caught type O104:H4 enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) from the
sprouts, but had not yet fallen ill, passed it to 20 other people via
food she handled. A spokesman, Harald Kehlborn, said investigators
were checking the kitchen, but added that the infection would have
been impossible if kitchen staff had properly washed their hands after
using the toilet. He said it might turn out the _E. coli_ had been
spread via a kitchen utensil at the firm, which mainly supplied food
for home parties. The female worker later developed the most severe
form of EHEC infection, hemolytic-uremic syndrome.

[Although the dates of onset of the cases are not stated, the
presumed index case of the food preparer should have been a period
before the secondary cases.

Secondary cases of EHEC can occur in the household setting as well
(as Dr. Donnenberg points out) as well although the fact that most
cases were in adults (with better bathroom hygiene) may be the reason
that such cases are not significant in number in this outbreak. In
update 19 (E. coli O104 - EU (19): case update, organism description 20110615.1823), the WHO post stated:

"There are 3343 HUS and EHEC cases in total, including 37 fatalities.
All but 5 of the above HUS and EHEC cases were in people who had
traveled to or lived in Germany during the incubation period for
infection, typically 3-4 days after exposure (range: 2-10 days).
Nevertheless, all 5 of these cases can be linked to the outbreak in
Germany. The link, although not stated, is likely household exposure
unless the 5 are part of the 20 secondary foodborne cases above."
