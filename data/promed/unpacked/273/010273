A groundhog [also known as a woodchuck, _Marmota monax_] that bit a human in Leonardtown [Maryland] tested positive for rabies, the St. Mary's County Health Department reported Tuesday afternoon [9 Aug 2016].

The incident occurred the evening of Saturday, 30 Jul 2016, at Fairwood Court in Leonardtown, off Route 5 south of the St. Mary's County Fairgrounds.

The groundhog is the 11th animal from St. Mary's County this year [2016] confirmed through laboratory testing to have rabies. Six raccoons, 3 skunks and 1 cat have been confirmed as rabid since 1 Jan 2016, according to the health department. Five animals from St. Mary's County were confirmed in 2015 to have rabies -- 3 raccoons and 2 cats.

Rabies is a potentially fatal virus that is transmitted through the saliva of an infected animal. Exposure may occur through a bite, scratch or contact with saliva to broken skin or mucous membranes such as the eyes or nose. All animal bites or exposures should be reported promptly to allow for appropriate rabies prevention measures.

The St. Mary's County Health Department in a press release urged residents to practice rabies protection this summer and throughout the year by vaccinating their pets and avoiding contact with wild animals that display unusual or aggressive behavior.

Vaccination of pets is a 1st line of defense against rabies. Pet owners are encouraged to review the shot records of their pets with a veterinarian. The St. Mary's Animal Welfare League holds monthly rabies vaccine clinics March through November for a cost of USD 15 per vaccine. Clinic dates for the remainder of 2016 are 12 Sep, 10 Oct and 14 Nov from 6 to 8 p.m. at the county fairgrounds in Leonardtown.

To report a bite by any animal, contact the St. Mary's County Sheriff's Office at 301-475-8008. For more information about rabies and the rabies vaccination clinics, visit the health department's website at http://www.smchd.org.

[2] Pennsylvania - coyote, human exposure

A coyote that tested positive for rabies was shot and killed hours after it attacked and bit a man on Monday night [8 Aug 2016] in Lincoln Borough [Pennsylvania], according to the Allegheny County Health Department.

The coyote was shot Tuesday [9 Aug 2016] by officers with the Lincoln Police Department, the county said, and Pennsylvania Game Commission employees took its carcass to the health department lab, where it tested positive for rabies.

The bite victim, who was identified only as an adult male, has already begun post-exposure treatment, the health department said. Even though the rabid coyote was killed, the health department warned that because coyotes are pack animals, others may be infected.

The health department advises anyone who is bitten, scratched or exposed to saliva from a stray or any other unknown animal to immediately cleanse the contact area with soap and water, seek emergency medical treatment, and report the incident to the health department.

The Allegheny County Health Department can be reached at 412-687-2243. The health department also says to use caution when pets are left outside. Residents should get their pets a rabies vaccine and keep them away from stray or wild animals. Wear rubber gloves to handle any pet that comes into contact with a stray animal, cleanse any wounds, and bring it to a veterinarian for an examination.

The rabies virus can be transmitted through a bite or scratch and is usually fatal if left untreated. But the vaccination is highly effective when given quickly after a rabies exposure [post-exposure prophylaxis - Mod.TG].

[3] Texas - bat, human exposure
Date: Fri 12 Aug 2016

A Seguin [Texas] man was bit by a rabid bat after his dog alerted him to the creature's presence in the home on Sunday [7 Aug 2016].

Seguin Police Deputy Chief Bruce Ure said the man reported the incident happened on Sunday in the 1600 block of Eastwood Drive.

"The gentleman's dog alerted him to the bat by barking, it was actually inside his house," he said.

Believing the bat was dead, the man tried to pick it up to remove it, Ure said.

"When he went down to pick it up and throw it away, that's when the bat bit him on the left thumb," he said.

The man went to Guadalupe Regional Medical Center for treatment.

While Nicole Patek, GRMC executive director of emergency services, can't comment on specific cases, she said it is typical for the hospital to give victims an immunization shot, as well as start the rabies series.

"Depending on the animal, we treat the bites the same way," she said. "We administer the same treatment because we don't wait for the information to determine if the animal is rabid. We administer the immune globulin for the rabies. It is a vaccination and the 1st day they are here, they get an injection into the site of the bite."

The series includes 4, sometimes 5 additional shots over a 14 to 28 day period, Patek said. [It should be noted these shots are given in the muscle, usually the arm muscle. - Mod.TG]

"We have day zero, and bring them back at days 3, 7, and 14 and sometimes 28," she said.

Determining who can avoid going through the series of shots depends on the animal and whether there is proof of rabies vaccination, Patek said.

"If they haven't had their rabies shots or we can't prove that they have or can't capture the animal, we usually err on the side of caution," she said. "If it's your dog, kept inside and you vaccinate your animals, we probably don't need to start the treatment. If it is any kind of risky animal or you can't verify if they are vaccinated then we have to start the treatment."

Following the report, the offending bat was sent to the State Health Services lab for rabies testing and came back positive, Ure said.

"That is the case 100 percent of the time," he said. "Other circumstances will determine whether we send the bat or any animal off to testing. There are other extenuating circumstances that we would look at before we submit it for testing at the state."

According to the Center for Disease Control website, rabies is transmitted by coming in contact with the saliva or brain/nervous system tissue of an infected mammal.

"You can only get rabies by coming in contact with these specific bodily excretions and tissues," the site said. "The most common mode of rabies virus transmission is through the bite and virus-containing saliva of an infected host."

It is unknown if the Chihuahua, who let his homeowner know about the unwanted intruder, was bitten, but nonetheless the pup has to be quarantined as a precaution to make sure the disease wasn't transmitted, Ure said.

"Really the dog is the hero in this whole deal because he is the one who alerted his owner to the bat," he said. "This little guy alerted his homeowner to a rabid bat, and now he's getting stuck in a crate for 45 days with no contact from anyone."

Ure said the police department and Seguin Animal Services are allowing the dogs owners to participate in an at-home quarantine.

"We are coordinating a home quarantine with the dog's owner," he said. "Even though the dog was up-to-date on his rabies vaccine, state law says in a scenario like this, we have to quarantine the animal, and we believe home quarantine is appropriate."

In order to avoid being a potential victim, Ure recommends leaving the bat handling to the professionals.

"We recommend, if you [or] someone were to find a sick or deceased bat to notify our animal services and we'll come out and investigate," he said. "A bat laying on the ground is 10 times more dangerous than a bat flying in the air. Rule number one is never handle a bat, even to attempt to try to pick up what appears to be a deceased bat, even with a shovel, because the bat might be agitated and come after you if it is sick and aggressive."

With large bat colonies nearby like the Bracken Bat Cave -- believed to be the largest colony of Mexican free-tailed bats in the world -- just northeast of San Antonio and the South Congress Bridge in Austin, it's not uncommon to see bats in the area.

"Bats in general are great for the environment and we like bats, but they are known to be carriers of rabies," Ure said.

Additionally, reports of bat bites are not common, Ure said.

"It is very rare," he said. "When it does happen, it is an extremely serious event. In this instance, the bat was inside the house. It is not uncommon for bats to come into a house if the door is open, especially a sick bat."

Patek added that anybody bitten should seek medical attention immediately to reduce any chance of infection.

"We encourage people to come in right away when they are bit," she said. "We take a report based on the animal information and we have to report that to animal control, whether it be the county or the city where it occurred. The physician or nurse practitioner will see them from there and provide guidance on what course of action would be necessary."

To report a sick, injured or dead animal call Seguin Animal Services at 830-379-2123 or Guadalupe County Animal Control 830-379-1224.

[4] Ohio - bat, human exposure
Date: Fri 12 Aug 2016

http://www.newsobserver.com/news/article95243497.html


Officials say a bat that was infected with rabies bit a woman in southwest Ohio.

Clermont County health officials say the bat was discovered in the woman's Batavia home and captured for testing by the state Department of Health. Officials say the woman is undergoing treatment and is expected to recover.

The rabies case is the 1st in the county since 2013, when it was also discovered in a bat.

Rabies is rare in the country, but it almost always results in death. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says rabies only accounts for 1 or 2 human deaths per year.

The CDC says humans who do succumb to the virus normally do so because they weren't aware they were exposed to it.

[Rabies is a fatal virus. It is fatal without prompt and specific treatment to include post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP).

It is rare that groundhogs or woodchucks are encountered with rabies, but it is a reminder that any mammal can have rabies.

Bat bites are not always visible. Therefore, in situations in which a bat is physically present and there is a possibility of an inapparent exposure, the bat should be captured and submitted to a rabies laboratory for testing. If rabies cannot be ruled out by laboratory testing, people with a reasonable probability of an exposure may be recommended for rabies post-exposure treatment (or for domestic animals, a requirement for a booster vaccination(s) and quarantine or euthanasia). Scenarios that may indicate a reasonable probability of exposure to rabies include:
- a child touches a live or dead bat;
- an adult touches a bat without seeing the part of the body they touched;
- a bat flies into a person and touches bare skin;
- a person steps on a bat with bare feet;
- a person awakens to find a bat in the room with him/her;
- a bat is found near an infant, toddler, or a person who is sensory or mentally challenged; or
- a person puts their hand in firewood, brush, a crevice, or a dark space (i.e. a closet), experiences pain, then sees a bat.

Rabies clinics or rabies drives are important to heighten the importance of rabies in an area and to educate citizens. These activities are helpful in bringing out people who may not otherwise visit a veterinarian's office.

Vaccinating your pet against rabies is insurance for your pet and for you. It saves you the heartache of pet loss, but it also builds a barrier between you and rabies circulating in animals that you or your pet may come into contact with.
