According to the health minister of Chad, Ngombaye Djaibe, a meningitis
epidemic has killed 56 people [during] a little over 2 weeks in Logone
Oriental and Mandoul regions, in southern Chad.

The minister added that medical services have treated 517 people suffering
from this disease, 56 of whom have died. Nevertheless, more than 40 000
people have been vaccinated and the situation is under control. Chad is
part of a "meningitis belt" stretching from Senegal to Djibouti.

[The following is extracted from ProMED-mail moderator ML's comments in
Meningitis, pneumococcal - Africa: WHO meningitis region 20100213.0507:

"Numerous cases of meningococcal meningitis are reported in the sub-Saharan
African region known as the "meningitis belt" each year during the hot, dry
season, between December and June, and every 8-12 years large outbreaks
occur (<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-Menin.aspx>).

"The "Meningitis Belt" extends from Senegal in the west to Ethiopia and
Eritrea in the east (<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no10/03-0170.htm>).
Attack rates during these cyclic epidemics of meningitis range from 100 to
800 per 100 000 population, but individual communities have reported rates
as high as 1000 per 100 000 (World Health Organization: Meningococcal
meningitis fact sheet;
<http://www.emro.who.int/sudan/pdf/FactSheet-Meningitis.pdf>). While in
endemic disease the highest attack rates are observed in young children,
during epidemics, older children, teenagers and adults are also affected.

"Although epidemics of meningitis are mostly associated with the
meningococcus, there is evidence that increases in pneumococcal meningitis
cases occur in parallel in sub-Saharan Africa during the hot and dry season

available at <http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/198>].

"Bacterial meningitis in Africa is associated with high mortality and risk
of neuropsychological sequelae. The 3 leading causes of bacterial
meningitis (_S. pneumoniae_, _Haemophilus influenzae_, and _N.
meningitidis_) are vaccine preventable, and routine use of conjugate
vaccines in African children could provide substantial health and economic
benefits through the prevention of childhood meningitis cases

ProMED-mail posted a report that an outbreak of meningitis in Chad last
year (2009) involved _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroups A and W135 (see
Meningitis, meningococcal - Chad (02) 20090424.1544); meningitis due to
these serogroups is potentially vaccine-preventable. The news release above
does not specify the microbial etiology of the current meningitis outbreak
in Chad.

Chad is divided into 18 regions. The 2 southern regions of Logone Oriental,
and Mandoul can be found on a map of Chad at
