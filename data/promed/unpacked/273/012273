Some people may have heard that scarlet fever has been going around Emporia and the surrounding area. Dr. Derek Brown, pediatrician with Newman Pediatrics, confirms that there have been a large number of patients over the last few weeks in his office with more than a half a dozen cases noted and counting.

"To some people, the term scarlet fever sounds exotic and is perceived as scary. But actually, scarlet fever is simply a rash caused by the same bacteria that causes strep throat," reports Dr. Brown.

Scarlet fever is caused by an infection with group A streptococcus bacteria. The bacteria make a toxin (poison) that can cause a scarlet-colored rash from which this illness gets its name. Not all streptococci bacteria make this toxin.

Six cases of scarlet fever in a town with population of about 25 000 gives an incidence of 24 per 100 000. For comparison, the annual incidence rates of scarlet fever reported for Hong Kong in the past decade has been 2 to 3 per 100 000, and for England and Wales in the years 1999-2009, about 4 per 100 000 (http://www.hpa.org.uk/web/HPAwebFile/HPAweb_C/1251473364307).

The news report above does not indicate whether there is an epidemiological link among the "more than a half dozen cases noted and counting" of scarlet fever in Emporia, Kansas. Genotypic characterization of outbreak isolates by molecular methods, such as multilocus sequence typing, ribotyping, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, will aid in identifying common outbreak strains. We await this information and an accurate enumeration of confirmed cases.

The city of Emporia is the county seat of Lyon County, Kansas, United States (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emporia,_Kansas). Newman Regional Health is described as a 99-bed county hospital operated on a not-for-profit basis, with 28 physicians on the active medical staff (http://www.newmanrh.org/Home/AboutUs/tabid/18888/Default.aspx).
