False alarm over 'anthrax' cow: tests carried out for anthrax spores
-----------------------
Tests for anthrax following the sudden death of a cow on a farm in
Lennoxtown, East Dunbartonshire, have proved negative.
Examinations conducted by the Central Veterinary Laboratory in
Weybridge, Surrey, have confirmed that the seven-year-old animal did
not die from the disease.
Once information was received about the sudden death of the animal,
officials moved quickly to incinerate the cow and to disinfect the
farm.
Movement restrictions which were also imposed around Balcorrach farm
in Lennoxtown have now been lifted.
