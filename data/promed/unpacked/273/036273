I am writing with reference to the previous post on 6 Jun 2003 (Unexplained
deaths, canine - UK (Scotland) 20030605.1384). The dogs were swimming in a
loch I think, and died a few hours afterwards. Nothing else on this has
been posted. I wondered whether it was domoic acid poisoning?

[Domoic acid poisoning is a possibility. The article you reference gave no
clinical signs and only mentioned blue-green algae as a possibility.
Generally domoic acid seems associated with marine environments, and the
loch was supposedly fresh water.
If anyone has more specific information with regard to the ultimate outcome
of dogs in the loch or other public health issues associated with water or
edible organisms from the loch, we would appreciate knowing about it. - Mod.TG]
