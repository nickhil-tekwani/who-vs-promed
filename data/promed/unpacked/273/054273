FMD surveillance zone to lift
-----------------------------
DEFRA today [2 Nov 2007] confirmed that the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD)
Surveillance Zone will be lifted on Mon 5 Nov 2007 subject to there being
no change in the disease situation and the completion of the necessary
surveillance testing.

Extensive surveillance has been completed in the FMD Surveillance Zone and
no further cases of FMD have been discovered.

The current Restricted Zone, and movement restrictions that apply in this
zone, remain in place.

Discussions are ongoing with the European Commission regarding further
changes to allow the easing of export restrictions.

Deputy chief veterinary officer, Fred Landeg, said: "Animal Health have
completed extensive surveillance work in the FMD Surveillance Zone and the
negative results now allow us to lift the Surveillance Zone which will be
welcome news to many farmers. However farmers must remain vigilant and
continue to check their animals for signs of disease twice daily."

[Since submitting, on 4 Aug 2007, the immediate notification to the OIE on
the 1st FMD outbreak, DEFRA has sent 12 weekly follow-up reports. The most
recent one, No 12, was submitted on 26 Oct 2007. The last recorded outbreak
started, reportedly, on 29 Sep 2007 on Anckerwyke Farme, Windsor and
Maidenhead, Berkshire. The last 3 reports have indicated absence of new
outbreaks.

A summary of the FMD situation in the UK, with a map and links to each of
