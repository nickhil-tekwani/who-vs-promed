Chikungunya virus has infected a total of 473 people in Sukoharjo
District, during the 1st 4 months of 2008, Agus Prihatmo of the
Sukoharjo health service said. "During the January-March 2008 period,
some 314 residents were infected with chikungunya virus, and the
number increased by 159 in April alone," he said.

The chikungunya cases were found in 27 villages located in 9
subdistricts, he said. Gatak Subdistrict has the largest number of
cases with 37 chikungunya patients.

The villages would continue to be prone to the disease during the
current La Nina-induced rainy season expected to end in June [2008],
he said. He urged the local residents to intensify the eradication of
mosquito-breeding grounds.

Chikungunya, like dengue fever, is spread by _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes and is characterized by an extremely high fever. But the
symptoms are different [from dengue] because they include severe
joint pain that could last up to a week, but sometimes up to 6 months
and even more.
