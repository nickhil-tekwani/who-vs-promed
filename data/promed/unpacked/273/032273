Since the last update on 5 Jun 2015, 7 new ill people infected with the outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Paratyphi B variant L(+) tartrate(+) have been reported from Arizona (1), California (3), Michigan (1), and Minnesota (2). As of 14 Jul 2015, 60 people have been reported from 11 states. The number of ill people reported from each state is as follows: Arizona (11), California (34), Illinois (1), Michigan (1), Minnesota (2), Mississippi (1), New Mexico (6), South Dakota (1), Virginia (1), Washington (1), and Wisconsin (1).

Illness onset dates range from 5 Mar 2015 to 30 Jun 2015. Ill people range in age from younger than 1 year to 83 with a median age of 32, and 56 percent are male. Among 57 people with available information, 11 (19 percent) have been hospitalized, and no deaths have been reported.

Investigation Update
-------------
Epidemiologic and laboratory findings indicate that frozen raw tuna is the likely source of the infections. In interviews, ill people answered questions about foods eaten and other exposures in the week before they became ill. Of 46 ill people for whom information is known, 43 (93 percent) reported consuming sushi in the week before they became ill. This proportion is significantly higher when compared with results from a survey of healthy people in which 5 percent reported eating "sushi, sashimi, or ceviche made with raw fish or shellfish" in the 7 days before they were interviewed. Of the 42 people with information about their sushi exposure, 41 (98 percent) reported eating a sushi item containing raw tuna, and 25 (86 percent) of 29 with information reported eating a sushi item containing raw "spicy tuna." The traceback investigation is ongoing, but preliminary investigation identified that frozen raw tuna was used to make the raw tuna sushi reported by ill persons.

The Minnesota Department of Health and Department of Agriculture isolated the outbreak strain from samples of unopened frozen raw tuna products collected from a Minnesota grocery store where an ill person in this outbreak reported eating tuna sushi. The contaminated frozen raw tuna products collected from the store represented one lot of product imported from Indonesia by Osamu Corporation.

The National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is a USA public health surveillance system that tracks antimicrobial resistance in foodborne and other enteric bacteria found in people, raw meat and poultry, and food-producing animals. NARMS is a partnership among the CDC, the FDA, the USDA, and state and local health departments. The NARMS human surveillance program at CDC monitors antimicrobial resistance in Salmonella and other bacteria isolated from clinical specimens submitted to NARMS by public health laboratories. CDC's NARMS laboratory conducted antimicrobial resistance testing on clinical isolates collected from 3 ill people infected with the outbreak strain. Of the 3 isolates, 1 (33 percent) isolate was resistant to ampicillin and 2 (67 percent) were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested on the NARMS panel.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill people and to interview them about foods they ate before they became ill. CDC will provide updates when more information is available.

[The organism has been linked to human salmonellosis acquired from ornamental aquaria (Levings RS, Lightfoot D, Hall RM, et al. Aquariums as reservoirs for multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B. Emerg Infect Dis 2006; 12: 507-10
http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no03/05-1085.htm).

Outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to fish for eating are uncommon and are more likely to be related to contamination of the fish after they are caught.

The yellowfin tuna (_Neothunnus macropterus_; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowfin_tuna) is a type of tuna eaten by humans as food. It has been reported to be up to 239 cm (94 inches) in length and 200kg (440 lb) in weight. The fish is also known as 'ahi' tuna, after the Hawaiian word for fire, due to the smoke from their fishing ropes rubbing violently on the gunwales of their wooden canoes while pulling the fish in. A picture of this fish can be found at the URL above. - Mod.LL
