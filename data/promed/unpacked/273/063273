Three of 80 elk cremated last week at a Philipsburg,Montana game farm were
infected with the deadly chronic wasting disease (CWD), test results
released Monday confirm.
The Montana Department of Livestock (MDOL) said the recent test results
prove state officials were correct to destroy the entire elk herd at the
David Kesler game farm. Livestock officials called for the destruction of
the elk in November 1999 after earlier tests showed 1 dead animal there
carried the deadly elk and deer affliction.
The discovery of CWD at the Kesler game farm was the first documented case
of the disease in Montana. Chronic wasting disease, for which there is no
test in live animals, attacks the nervous system of the animal and is fatal
to elk and deer.
The recent tests on the elk herd were conducted at National Veterinary
Sevices Laboratory in Ames, Iowa. Two other laboratories in Colorado and
Idaho are still conducting similar research on tissue samples from the dead
elk. The Kesler animals were euthanized by lethal injection in December and
burned last week in an incinerator at the game farm. The remaining ashes
from the incineration were buried at the site.
Gertonson estimated Livestock officials spent about $50,000 destroying the
80 elk.
Meanwhile, Gertonson said the MDOL will continue work with other state
agencies to review current rules and regulations on game farms to ensure
they are "as strict as the law and science can justify." He said no plans
are currently in the works to stiffen the oversight of game farms.
Gertonson said officials plan to review and develop a plan for the game farm
near Hardin, which imported animals from the Kesler operation in 1995-96 and
now is under quarantine. He said it's unclear what the plan will entail, but
wouldn't rule out continuing to keep the game farm under quarantine or
destroying the existing animal population in the future.
Craig Sharpe, interim executive director of the Montana Wildlife Federation
called for a halt on all movement of game farm animals, both inter and
intrastate. He also said the herd at the Hardin game farm should be
destroyed.
But Mark Taylor, spokesman for the Montana Alternative Livestock Producers,
said the state handled the situation appropriately, adding, game farm
operators are equally concerned about the spread of disease.
"We had a situation where CWD was found on an elk ranch and timely steps
were taken by the MDOL to protect not only Montana's wild herds, but
domestic herds as well," said Taylor. He said calls for a total ban on the
movement of game farm animals not only lacks scientific basis, but would
hurt game farm operators who want to acquire new animals, breed animals or
expand their herds.
Current regulations require whenever an animal dies at a game farm that the
animal be tested for CWD. Also, the state requires before any captive animal
is imported into Montana it is monitored for the disease for at least 2
years.
