The Ministry of Agriculture has notified a case of bluetongue in a
cow on a dairy farm in Bavel, North Brabant.
This is the 1st case of bluetongue in the Netherlands this year
[2007]. The cow was tested for export purposes and was not a sentinel
animal. It did not show clinical symptoms. Both antibodies as well as
the virus itself were detected.
The Ministry has not implemented any additional prevention/control
measures to the existing ones. The farm is situated within the "20-km
area" (12.4 mi) [an area which is already under a regime of
surveillance and movement control, according to EU regulations].
Neither application of insecticides nor keeping animals indoors are required.

[Bavel is a village in North Brabant, near Breda. For a map, see
<http://www.multimap.com/maps/?&t=l&map=51.56568,4.82960|14|4&loc=NL:51.56568:4.82960:14#t=l&map=51.56568,4.8296|9|4&loc=NL:51.56568:4.82960:14>.
Following the recent appearance of the 1st bluetongue cases for 2007
in neighbouring Germany and Belgium, the detection of vector/virus
activity in other areas affected last year (2006), such as southern
Netherlands, is not surprising.
Since vaccination is not applied, bluetongue may cause losses --
mainly to the sheep industry -- in the affected area during the coming months.
An official notification, including confirmation of the serotyping,
is anticipated. - Mod.AS]
