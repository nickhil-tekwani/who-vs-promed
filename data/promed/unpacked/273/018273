A deadly squirrel disease which only affects reds could see the species
disappear from some of its last remaining English strongholds within a
decade, new research revealed today.
Previously scientists believed that grey squirrels were wiping out native
reds simply by taking over their habitats, but an international study has
blamed a virus which they transmit to the red [squirrel] population,
killing them within a fortnight.
Researchers have now called for a selective cull of greys in "gateways" to
red squirrel areas to prevent the protected species from being exposed to
the virus.
According to scientists from Newcastle University and London's Queen Mary
University, the disease, squirrel poxvirus, threatens to wipe out red
squirrels in some of the areas in which they remain in northern England
within 10 years.
In areas where it has been detected, the rate of decline in reds is 17-25
times higher than in places where there has been no outbreak.
Red squirrels have been in Britain for the last 10 000 years and are
protected under the UK's Wildlife and Countryside Act, while domineering
greys were introduced from the United States more than 100 years ago.
Researchers say that in the absence of a vaccine, the only effective way of
stopping the spread is to target greys at the narrow entry points and
corridors to England's 16 designated red squirrel refuges, by killing the
small numbers of greys that may come in.
Squirrel poxvirus was probably brought into the country with some of the
American greys, of which 70 percent have been exposed and are carriers.
While they appear to escape unharmed, it is fatal to reds, causing sores
and ulcers on the face, feet and thighs.
Today's recommendations for grey squirrel management appear in 2 academic
journals, Epidemiology and Infection, and Biological Conservation.
Scientists studied Cumbria and Norfolk, where the virus had broken out, and
compared them with Scotland and Italy, where there was no trace of the
disease, and found the reds' population area decline was up to 25 times
worse where they were exposed to the disease.
A selective, small-scale cull of grey squirrels has been achieved in
Kielder Forest, Northumberland, after experts analysed the red squirrel
refuge and identified 4 areas through which where greys could get access.
There are now plans to apply the approach to the other 15 squirrel refuges
in Cumbria, Northumberland, North Yorkshire and Merseyside.
Dr Peter Lurz, a research associate at the Institute for Research on
Environment and Sustainability at Newcastle University, said: "It is vital
we get this disease under control, especially as it is now threatening to
spread across the border to Scotland with severe consequences for red
squirrel conservation there.
"We are not trying to wipe out the grey squirrel but as conservationists we
have a duty to look after the red squirrel as it is a protected, native
species. Small, targeted control at local entry points to refuge areas is
an accepted management strategy and already works well in controlling
populations of species like the deer and rabbit. It's a practical and
affordable solution."
Tony Sainsbury, lecturer in wild animal health at the Zoological Society of
London (ZSL), added: "The cases seen by ZSL's national red squirrel disease
surveillance programme clearly demonstrate the severity and debilitating
nature of the squirrel poxvirus disease on red squirrels. Given that the
grey squirrel is an introduced species, and therefore the disease has
occurred as a consequence of human action, the onus is very much on us to
look for practical solutions to control the disease and protect red
squirrels from this fatal disease. Our work concludes that targeted control
is the most viable way forward."

[The parapoxvirus threat to red squirrels has been described in detail in
previous postings; the novelty in the cited new research is the proposed
conservation system by targeted control, namely selective, small-scale cull
of grey squirrels which -- as one might suspect -- will raise some debates.
