A new suspected case of equine encephalitis occurred on Tuesday [6
Jul 2010] at the Children's Hospital, which brings to 25 the number
of cases. This case is a 6-year-old girl from Meteti, Darien.
According to a report by the Ministry of Health [MoH], the health
condition of the child is stable.

Of the 25 suspected cases, 4 remain hospitalized, 20 were discharged,
and one died. Samples taken from these patients were sent for
analysis to the Gorgas Memorial Institute.

The MoH reiterates that it is important that people experiencing any
symptoms or signs such as fever, headache and bone pain, irritability
(if the child is under one year), vomiting or diarrhea, contact their
nearest health center for medical evaluation.

[The outbreak continues. There is still no MOH confirmation that
these are cases of eastern equine encephalitis infection. There may
have been recent transmission of Venezuelan equine encephalitis to
equine animals in the area. A previous ProMED-mail post indicated
that Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus was responsible for
the equine cases, as the government of Panama had reported to OIE
(see ProMED-mail archive no. 20100609.1934).
