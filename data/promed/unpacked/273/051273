A Hawke's Bay District Health Board [DHB] update reveals 45 people, mostly over 70, were admitted to hospital with campylobacteriosis.

The DHB has conducted 4 surveys since the event in August 2016, the latest on 27 and 28 Sep 2016, the results of which they collated with the previous findings. The surveys were conducted by telephone and the latest figures brought the estimated total number of residents affected by gastroenteritis to 5530 or 39 percent of Havelock North's population, 1072 of those confirmed cases.

Of those hospitalized, as of 10 Oct 2016, 27 were aged over 70, followed by 4 in the 60-69 year age group, 4 in the 40-49 age group, and 3 in the 50-59 age group. 4 people under the age of 20 also ended up in hospital.

The total number of people who had developed the rare complication from campylobacteriosis, Guillan-Barré Syndrome (GBS), was reported to be 3 people. As the incubation time is up to 4 weeks, it was considered that any new cases now would not be linked to the original outbreak.

Of the estimated 5530 residents who were affected, 32 percent had a recurrence of the bug, and as of 28 Sep 2016, 4 people were experiencing ongoing symptoms. At the time an estimated 78 percent of people who had symptoms took time off work or school.

Although the boil water notice was lifted on 3 Sep 2016, 30 percent of households continued to boil their drinking water, the survey found.

More detailed analysis was yet to be conducted, and the DHB said that may change the findings.

Since the 1995 paper by Rees, et al (1), _C. jejuni_ was found to be associated with GBS, as recent campylobacteriosis was found in 26 percent of patients with GBS as compared to one percent of matched controls. Of note, the GBS cases associated with _C. jejuni_ were significantly associated with the poorer outcome of slow recovery and residual disability. Although no specific serotype of _C. jejuni_ was linked to GBS in the study above, a subsequent paper (2) found that serotype O:19 strains were overrepresented in USA and Germany cases of GBS, and these strains were likely to be serum-resistant.

Subsequently, it has been found that the pathophysiology of the association was an example of antigenic mimicry (3). That is, the lipooligosaccharide of certain _C. jejuni_ strains cross reacted with human GM1 ganglioside and, in rabbits, anti-GM1 antibody was elicited following _C. jejuni_ lipooligosaccharide, and limb weakness developed. More recently, Bax, et al (4) reported that differences in sialic acid linkage of the bacterial saccharide produced different modulations of the immune response, which can explain why some organisms may be linked to GBS and others not.
