Sheep measles is a disease that won't disappear any time soon. The roaming of untreated dogs defaecating on pasture grazed by sheep and feeding off raw sheep meat has an important part to play in the disease. Sheep measles is the common name given to lesions in sheep and goats caused by an "intermediate stage" of a tapeworm parasite. They are seen as hard white cysts either on the surface or deep in muscle tissue. The blemishes in sheep meat can result in downgrading or, in extreme cases, condemning of sheep or lamb carcasses at the meatworks. It costs the farmer revenue.

Dogs act as host for the tapeworm. This parasite stage is also known as _Cysticercus ovis_. The primary stage of the parasite is a tapeworm (_Taenia ovis_), which infects the intestine of dogs.

In the Western Bay of Plenty, the prevalence of lesions in lambs at the meatworks has steadfastly rebounded this year back up to 0.4 per cent of carcasses seen. In comparison to other North Island sheep centres that have a much higher prevalence, we are in a unique position to reduce it further. But our biggest threat is an outbreak in a single property. This is what has happened in the nearby district of Matamata-Piako.

It is important for farmers, lifestyle block owners, hunters/fishers, and urban dog owners to understand 2 key aspects of control:
- monthly dosing of all dogs that reside on the property or visit properties where sheep graze with an appropriate wormer with praziquantel (for example, Droncit Dontal Allwormer); and
- no feeding of raw sheep (and goat) meat or offal unless it is cooked [72 deg C/162 deg F] or frozen (10 days at -10 deg C/14 deg F).

We advise not feeding raw meat, and to treat your dog at least monthly with a broad-spectrum wormer that does tapeworm. Many modern "wormers" claim to treat worms as a "treat" or "pour-on", but they are for the commoner roundworms, hookworms, and whipworms.

The main concern and risk we run in the Western Bay of Plenty is the lifestyle and/or urban dog that is free to roam across farmland and has been exposed to untreated sheep meat. This threat is only greater with an increasing population of people and their pet dogs walking in the region. Pet owners need to prove to the landowner that their dog is treated (your veterinarian can certify) and the landowner has an on-farm dosing programme for working and pet dogs.

[Sheep measles is not a [human] health risk, unlike hydatids, a related disease, which is now officially eradicated in this country. But it leaves unsightly cysts in the carcasses of sheep, which can cause meat plants to reject them, at a cost to the farmer.

Sheep ingest tapeworm eggs from the pasture. These eggs then develop into cysts in any muscle tissue (such as diaphragm, heart, and skeletal muscle of sheep). If dogs are then fed the infected raw meat, a tapeworm will develop in the dog's gut, mature, and start producing eggs in about 35 days. Tapeworm eggs will then appear in the dog's droppings, and so the cycle repeats.

Never feed raw meat or untreated offal to dogs. All sheep (or goat) meat needs to be treated before being fed to dogs. Treatment involves 2 options:
1. Freezing: freeze meat at -10 deg C (14 deg F) or below for at least 7 days before feeding. Write on the bag the date (plus 8 days) that the meat went into the freezer so that you know when the meat is ready to be fed.
2. Cooking: heat meat to a core temperature of 72 deg C (162 deg F) or greater until its brown all the way through. Tinges of red indicate inadequate treatment, and further cooking is necessary.

As biosecurity, keep dogs under direct supervision and keep them close when not working. Require all dogs to be treated with an appropriate medication for the parasites within 48 hours of entering your premises.
