Visitors at the Centimudi Boat Ramp report seeing hundreds of dead
fish along the shoreline and in the water over the weekend [31 Jul-1
Aug 2010] at Lake Shasta. But it's a mystery how the fish died.

On Sunday [1 Aug 2010] there were still dozens of dead fish floating
belly-up in the water and scattered on the shoreline. The smell from
the fish carcasses permeated the area. "It was a mess here the last
couple of days," [an 83-year-old man] said while sitting under a tree
above the boat ramp on Sunday afternoon. "Yesterday [31 Jul 2010] it
(the smell) would have curled your hair."

A state Department of Fish and Game [DFG] official contacted by phone
Sunday afternoon said he would gather information on the fish kill
and report back. [The man, his wife, and a] friend, 64, come out to
the ramp to relax and talk nearly every day. [The friend] said the
fishy smell is not typical. "Usually, all you smell is some fuel from
boats -- that's about it," [he] said.

The 3 heard reports that the Department of Fish and Game stocked the
area with trout late last week. The [64-year-old] speculated that the
fish died because they went from the cold water of the hatchery to
the warm water of Lake Shasta.

"Yesterday (Sat 31 Jul 2010) there were hundreds out there. Some of
them were 12 to 14 inches [30-35 cm] -- pan-sized," he said.

Sgt. Tom Campbell of the Shasta County Sheriff's Office Boating
Safety Unit said Sunday [1 Aug 2010] that deputies heard reports of
dead fish and saw some in the water, but his office doesn't know how they died.

Campbell said that is a question for the DFG.

[Unfortunately this sounds like another case of prolonged hot weather
warming the waters to temperatures higher than the fish can stand. It
is uncomfortable for them, but it also reduces the oxygen carrying
capacity of the water, and the fish can literally suffocate.

At the recent American Veterinary Medical Association meeting there
were discussions regarding the increase in water temperatures and the
resulting fish deaths.

Of course, this is based upon the fact that no disease or other cause
is found. It would be nice if there were some necropsies on the fish
to rule out disease.

ProMED-mail will continue to post undiagnosed die-offs of fish,
unless it is believed to be heat/oxygen deprivation related. - Mod.TG]
