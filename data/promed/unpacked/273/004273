The clinical signs reported as well as the rapid onset of illness in the affected dogs could be due to poisoning with organophosphate insecticides. These chemicals induce cholinergic overstimulation and cause muscarinic, nicotinic, and central nervous system abnormalities. All of the signs mentioned in the post, including coughing (muscarinic effect due to increased bronchial secretions and bronchoconstriction), weakness (nicotininc effect) and ataxia and seizures (central effect) can be explained by exposure to organophosphate poisoning.

[[The original posting stated: "Tito's (one of the dogs) still coughing after his close call on New Year's Eve [31 Dec 2016].

[NM] says she fed all 4 dog's Evanger's Hunk of Beef with Au Jus canned dog food as a treat. "I fed them one can and within 15 minutes they were acting drunk, walking around, then they couldn't walk and were falling over," [the woman] said. "I grabbed them all and I took them to the emergency vet and when I got them there they were limp. They weren't moving or anything." All 4 dogs went into intensive care.]

However, while organophosophates seems to fit, it also is not a good fit for this particular case. Other clinical signs typically associated with organophosphates such as salivation, lacrimation, urination, defecation, gastrointestinal effects (vomiting) are missing. Most dogs treated appropriately for organophosphate intoxication do not tend to maintain a cough. While it is not impossible, it is not likely either.

There have been no further reports, nor has there been a recall issued. So at the moment this remains unresolved. The company did seem to have a recall of some of its products in 2013. Those stories are still there, but there does not appear to be a recall in late 2016 or early 2017.

We appreciate Dr. Shearn-Bochsler considering this differential and letting us know. It was not the top of my differential list, but I would put it father down on that differential list. - Mod.TG
