Scientists have uncovered evidence that humans may have contracted the
deadly hepatitis B virus from apes and monkeys. Dr Peter Simmonds, of
Edinburgh University, said that crossover infection by the virus was likely
to have triggered the pandemic which now claims one million lives a year.
He was part of a team of British scientists who tested wild chimpanzees
from Cameroon. They tested positive for hepatitis B - and the virus matched
a strain contracted by a chimp at London Zoo.
In an article published in New Scientist magazine, the researchers said
their work provided powerful evidence of naturally occurring animal
epidemics. That could dispel theories that the virus was spread from the
Americas about 400 years ago, or that modern humans carried the virus out
of Africa 100,000 years ago. Dr Simmonds said the strains of the virus
probably co-evolved with primates 10 to 35 million years ago and different
strains occurred when the virus was passed over to humans.
The researchers said they remained puzzled because the six major human
strains of the virus were not very different, although the virus could
mutate quickly.
If it did pass to humans tens of thousands of years ago there should be a
greater genetic variation in the virus. Dr Simmonds said: "It may be that
initially the virus mutated rapidly, but beyond a certain point further
mutation was not viable."

[The comment that the virus mutated up to a point and then couldn't mutate
further is just letting the hypothesis fit the data, rather than the other
way round. It would be best if everyone interested would read the original,
peer-reviewed article, wherever that is. - Mod. CHC]
