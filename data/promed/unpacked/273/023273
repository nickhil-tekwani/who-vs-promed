Strange disease attacks maize crops
-----------------------------------
A disease called fusarium affecting the maize crop (variety Cusco)
has been detected in the area of Concepcion [Junin region]. For this
reason, help from SENASA [El Servicio Nacional de Sanidad Agraria;
National Agrarian Health Service] was requested. There are at least
150 hectares [371 acres] affected recording a yield loss of 5 to 8
tons per hectare [about 2-3 tons per acre].

[Several species of fungi originally classified in the genus
_Fusarium_ are causing a number of head blight, stalk rot, seedling
root rot, and ear and stalk rot diseases in grain crops such as maize,
wheat, barley, rye, and oats. While some of the pathogens have now
been re-classified, 'fusarium' has mostly been retained as the common
name of the associated diseases. They can cause yield losses of up to
45 per cent, reduce grain quality and may also contaminate the crop
with fungal toxins, which can seriously affect livestock.

In maize, fusarium diseases due to several different fungi may be
responsible for stalk, ear, and kernel rots as well as mycotoxin
production. _Gibberella fujikuroi_ (previously _Fusarium
verticillioides_) is of concern because it produces the toxin
fumonisin, but others, like _F. proliferatum_, also produce
mycotoxins. Fusarium ear rots are often associated with insect damage
to ears or kernels which provides easy entrance points for the fungi.

The fungi persist and multiply on infected crop residues. During
moist weather, spores of the fungi are windblown or splashed onto the
heads of cereal crops. Stress conditions and lesions caused by other
fungi or insects are known to increase susceptibility of host plants
to fusarium diseases. Disease management generally includes timely
fungicide applications, crop rotation with non-hosts and crop
varieties with reduced susceptibility.

In 2010, maize crops in the same region of Peru were reported to be
affected by downy mildew (ProMED-mail post 20100118.0205).
