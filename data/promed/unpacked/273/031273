TURTLE DIE-OFF - USA (TENNESSEE) (02)

The most likely explanation is that a pathogen has suddenly appeared
(either carried in by birds or migrating animals or emerging by mutation)
that causes hemolysis (lysis) of erythrocytes. This would result in
hemolytic anemia, and the large quantity of liberated iron would be
sequestered into the liver.
Similar diseases in humans are bartonellosis (Oroyo fever) and malaria. The
pathogen could be either a bacterium, a virus, or a protozoan, but probably
not a fungus. The disease eventually will vanish because the most
susceptible turtles are being killed; the resistant ones will survive and
multiply.
An alternative explanation is that the turtle die-off is caused not by a
novel disease pathogen but by a sudden ecological disturbance such as
waterway(s) contaminated by iron compounds or by hemolytic organic
compounds. This problem can be halted by determining what compound is
appearing in the waterway and by halting its dumping.
