The number of people sick in the UK in an outbreak linked to melons has almost doubled. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) and Public Health England (PHE) are investigating the incident with 99 people sick since April [2021]. It was previously known that 52 people were ill in the UK. Those more than 70 and less than 9 years old are the age groups mostly affected. Investigations are focusing on the supply chain of Galia, cantaloupe, and honeydew melons from Honduras and Costa Rica.

FSA is working with trade associations and retail businesses to get information relevant to the outbreak. A quick rise in confirmed infections occurred in the week commencing 24 May [2021]. Initial advice from the FSA warned about consuming whole melons from Brazil, but further investigations including analysis of the food chain and testing has shown that product from Brazil is unlikely to be involved.

Most UK retailers may have stocked the affected melons, which have now been removed from sale. Affected fruit was bought on or before 28 May [2021]. People can identify the country of origin from a sticker on the fruit. If the fruit does not have a sticker, consumers who have it in their homes should throw it away in an abundance of caution.

As of late May [2021], 11 other countries are also affected by the same outbreak strain of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Braenderup. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) is supporting an international outbreak investigation, and the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) has been following the multi-country outbreak since 10 May [2021]. Patients have been reported in Denmark, Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Canada, and Switzerland. Figures provided by the ECDC to Food Safety News show 356 people are sick, of which 267 have been confirmed.

Belgium has 51 infections with 4 confirmed from March [2021]. A total of 27 patients live in the Netherlands. Germany has 75 patients, of which 34 have been confirmed since 30 Mar [2021], and Switzerland has 15 cases with 12 confirmed between 24 Mar [2021] and 7 May [2021].

Denmark identified 30 people with the infection between 26 Mar [2021] and 17 May [2021], and Sweden has confirmed 45 patients who became ill from early April [2021]. Nine people are sick in Finland from mid-April [2021], and Norway has 5 cases between 13 and 26 Apr [2021] in a nursing home. Both Luxembourg and the Czech Republic have 3 confirmed patients.

One person is ill in Canada with symptom onset of 8 Mar [2021]. The 53-year-old male has no history of travel. Five people are affected in France, and there are 4 patients in Ireland since 30 Mar [2021].

[All 3 types of melon grow on the ground and can be contaminated through tainted irrigation water. The flesh is then contaminated when the rind is cut into.

All the cases are from Europe except for a single case in Canada without international travel. It is surprising that the single case occurred there without others.

"The Galia melon [which I had not heard of], also known as sarda in South East Asia, is a type of F1 hybrid melon originating from a cross between the green-flesh melon cultivar 'Ha-Ogen' and the netted-rind melon cultivar 'Krimka.' Developed in Israel at the NeÂ´ve Yaar Research Center of the Agricultural Research Organization and released in 1973, the Galia melon was named after the developer's daughter, whose name means 'God's wave' in Hebrew."

"Galias are now grown in Algeria, Brazil, Guatemala, Portugal, Spain, Morocco, Southern US regions, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, Greece, Turkey, Israel, and Egypt."
