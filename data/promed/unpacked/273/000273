Gray mould, caused by _Botrytis cinerea_, is among the most serious fungal disease of table grape (_Vitis vinifera_) worldwide. This pathogen is responsible for heavy losses in Mazzarrone, among the most important Italian areas for table grape production.

From 2009 to 2013, scientists collected 302 single-spore isolates of _B. cinerea_ from vineyards in [the] district [and] evaluated in vitro sensitivity to [6 fungicides from different chemical classes], identified point mutations in field isolates resistant to different fungicides, and investigated the presence of isolates with multiple fungicide resistance.

45.7 per cent were found to be resistant to at least 1 fungicide. About 10 per cent had multiple resistance to at least 2 or more individual fungicides. [Some] isolates [showed] simultaneous resistance to 4 different classes of fungicides. Accordingly, these fungicides failed to control infections by isolates with resistance or reduced sensitivity.

This study represents the 1st report of _B. cinerea_ field isolates with single or multiple resistance to botryticides. By continuous selection of multi-resistant isolates, chemical control of gray mould in vineyards will become increasingly difficult. Thus, careful monitoring of sensitivity and multiple resistance to botryticides over time will be crucial in managing fungicide resistance. [Fungicides] should be [used] in alternation or in mixtures with different [modes of] action and low risk of resistance development.

[The fungus _Botrytis cinerea_ can cause serious losses in both yield and fruit quality of grapevine. It causes lesions on leaves and also infects shoots, flowers, and fruit, leading to bunch rot. If blossoms are infected, the fungus remains latent until berries begin to soften. Infection is optimal at 15-20 deg C with free water or over 90 per cent humidity.

Grape cultivars with dense canopies, thin skins, and/or tight clusters are more susceptible. The rot may progress to infect berry clusters or whole bunches, and girdling lesions on the stems may lead to drying and premature fruit drop. Affected berries may split open, develop a grayish mould on the surface, and may shrivel in dry conditions.

The pathogen overwinters on plant material and is spread by water, wind, mechanical means and juice from split berries. Mechanical damage caused by birds or insects creates entry points for the fungus and can greatly increase losses. Disease management relies mainly on fungicide applications, phytosanitation, and cultural practices.

_B. cinerea_ also causes blights and grey molds on a wide range of hosts, including many crops such as brassicas and other vegetables, fruit crops and peanut.
