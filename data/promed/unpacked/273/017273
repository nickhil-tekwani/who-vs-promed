The 2 Hoosiers [residents of Indiana - Mod.LL] who contracted
botulism after consuming contaminated chili sauce remain hospitalized
in serious condition. They were among 4 people nationwide who became
ill from the Hot Dog Chili Sauce, a product made by Castleberry's Food Company.
A Fort Wayne television station spoke to the man who claimed to be
the son of the Indiana couple. He says his parents are recovering.
"Their condition has been improving recently. Their facial muscles
have come back. They've been able to communicate to us with facial
expressions," he said.

[There has been little information put forth regarding the
individuals who acquired clinical botulism. The Indiana couple
appears to be slowly improving and both of them appear still to be on
respirators (mechanical ventilation). - Mod.LL]

[2] Canada: recall

A botulism scare recall in the USA by Castleberry's Food Co., a unit
of Connors Bros. Income Fund, has been dramatically expanded and now
includes a canned chili product sold in Canada.
The weekend [21-22 Jul 2007] expansion of the recall followed a joint
American FDA (US Food & Drug Administration) and USDA (UD Department
of Agriculture) inspection of Castleberry's canning plant in Augusta,
Georgia. The plant was entirely shut down Sat 21 Jul 2007, until
health authorities clear it for renewed production.
The expanded recall includes Great Value chili sold at Wal-Mart
stores in Canada, along with more than 80 other varieties of
potentially undercooked human food products (up from 10 in the
original recall) and 4 types of dog food.
Castleberry's senior vice-president, Dave Melbourne, said yesterday,
23 Jul 2007 that Great Value Chili was the only affected product sold
in Canada.
