A landmark international study, just published in Science [1], charts an alarming rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in food animals in emerging economies around the world. Food animals' resistance rates to antibiotics commonly used in raising them -- and in treating diseases in humans -- are as high as 60% in some cases, according to the report. Left unchecked, it could mean the potential loss of animal proteins and farmer incomes. It could also negatively impact human health since drug-resistant pathogens can jump from animals to humans.

The study, conducted by a group of nonprofits and universities, crunched data from more than 900 surveys that give snapshots of AMR levels in different regions between 2000 and 2018.

"This study shows a remarkable increase in resistance," Ramanan Laxminarayan, one of the study's authors and the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, tells Modern Farmer. "We saw almost a 3-fold increase in AMR in poultry, cattle, and pigs over that time, indicating that, across the world, antimicrobial resistance is going up dramatically in animals."

Here are 4 takeaways from the landmark study:

1. The Problem: The researchers found that antimicrobial compounds with a failure rate of higher than 50% [the proportion of antimicrobial compounds with resistance higher than 50%] increased to 0.41 from 0.15 in poultry, to 0.41 from 0.13 in pigs, and to 0.23 from 0.12 in cattle during the 18 years. Rates of resistance varied among medically important antibiotics, ranging from 20% to 60% for ciprofloxacin and erythromycin and 10% to 40% for 3rd- and 4th-generation cephalosporins. These drugs are used to treat everything from respiratory infections to sexually transmitted diseases. "We didn't expect any increases that dramatic," Laxminarayan says.

2. The Cause: The worldwide demand for animal protein has skyrocketed over the last 20 years. To meet the demand, the unregulated or laxly regulated use of antibiotics in raising food animals globally has exploded. The drugs are often administered not to cure sick animals but rather to boost their growth and prevent massive disease outbreaks due to often unhygienic growing conditions using feed with low nutritional value, Laxminarayan says. Their overuse is directly linked to increased antibiotic-resistant infections in both animals and humans, according to the researchers.

3. The Hot Spots: The study found the highest rates of drug resistance in animals in parts of India and China. Other hot spots included regions of Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Viet Nam, Brazil, the Nile River delta, and areas surrounding Mexico City and Johannesburg. Here's a detailed map (https://resistancebank.org). Because antimicrobial-resistant superbugs can quickly spread over long distances, when it begins cropping up in one part of the world, it can spread globally.

4. The Solutions: The researchers believe better surveillance efforts need to be made worldwide, similar to what's in place in the USA and Europe. Additionally, country-level legislative action is needed to preserve antibiotics important for human health by restricting their use in animal production. Another one of their recommendations is to provide subsidies to improve farm hygiene at both the country level and through a global fund.

If nothing is done, the results could be catastrophic and not just for emerging economies, according to Laxminarayan. "No one's really faced a widespread infection in animals that was untreatable and that's what we're most concerned about," he says. "We're looking at the possibility of losing a global source of protein or at the very least an increased cost of production because sick animals are more difficult to treat. That's going to be a situation not only in developing countries but everywhere."

[The following is the abstract extracted from the journal article referenced in the news report above:

"Introduction: The global scale-up in demand for animal protein is the most notable dietary trend of our time. Since 2000, meat production has plateaued in high-income countries but has grown by 68%, 64%, and 40% in Asia, Africa, and South America, respectively. The transition to high-protein diets in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has been facilitated by the global expansion of intensive animal production systems in which antimicrobials are used routinely to maintain health and productivity. Globally, 73% of all antimicrobials sold on Earth are used in animals raised for food. A growing body of evidence has linked this practice with the rise of antimicrobial-resistant infections, not just in animals but also in humans. Beyond potentially serious consequences for public health, the reliance on antimicrobials to meet demand for animal protein is a likely threat to the sustainability of the livestock industry, and thus to the livelihood of farmers around the world.

"Rationale: In LMICs, trends in antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in animals are poorly documented. In the absence of systematic surveillance systems, point prevalence surveys represent a largely untapped source of information to map trends in AMR in animals. We use geospatial models to produce global maps of AMR in LMICs and give policy-makers -- or a future international panel -- a baseline for monitoring AMR levels in animals and target interventions in the regions most affected by the rise of resistance.

"Results: We identified 901 point prevalence surveys from LMICs reporting AMR rates in animals for common indicator pathogens: _Escherichia coli_, _Campylobacter_ spp., nontyphoidal _Salmonella_ spp., and _Staphylococcus aureus_. From 2000 to 2018, the proportion of antimicrobial compounds with resistance higher than 50% (P50) increased from 0.15 to 0.41 in chickens and from 0.13 to 0.34 in pigs and plateaued between 0.12 and 0.23 in cattle. Global maps of AMR (available at <resistancebank.org>) show hotspots of resistance in northeastern India, northeastern China, northern Pakistan, Iran, eastern Turkey, the south coast of Brazil, Egypt, the Red River delta in Viet Nam, and the areas surrounding Mexico City and Johannesburg. Areas where resistance is just starting to emerge are Kenya, Morocco, Uruguay, southern Brazil, central India, and southern China. Uncertainty in our predictions was greatest in the Andes, the Amazon region, West and Central Africa, the Tibetan plateau, Myanmar, and Indonesia. Dense geographical coverage of point prevalence surveys did not systematically correlate with the presence of hotspots of AMR, such as in Ethiopia, Thailand, Chhattisgarh (India), and Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil). The highest resistance rates were observed with the most commonly used classes of antimicrobials in animal production: tetracyclines, sulfonamides, and penicillins.

"Conclusion: The portfolio of antimicrobials used to raise animals for food is rapidly getting depleted, with important consequences for animal health, farmers' livelihoods, and potentially for human health. Regions affected by the highest levels of AMR should take immediate actions to preserve the efficacy of antimicrobials that are essential in human medicine by restricting their use in animal production. In some middle-income countries, particularly in South America, surveillance must be scaled up to match that of low-income African countries that are currently outperforming them despite more limited resources. Policy-makers coordinating the international response to AMR may consider sparing African countries from the most aggressive measures to restrict access to veterinary drugs, which may undermine livestock-based economic development and rightfully be perceived as unfair. However, in regions where resistance is starting to emerge, there is a window of opportunity to limit the rise of resistance by encouraging a transition to sustainable animal farming practices. High-income countries, where antimicrobials have been used on farms since the 1950s, should support this transition -- for example, through a global fund to subsidize improvement in farm-level biosafety and biosecurity."

The following is extracted from my moderator comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance (03): India (TG) environmental pollution 20161010.4548738:

"Between 2000 and 2010, total global antibiotic consumption is reported to have grown by more than 30% (https://cddep.org/sites/default/files/swa_2015_final.pdf). Although per capita consumption is generally higher in high-income countries, the greatest increase in antibiotic use has been in low- and middle-income countries, where there has been increasing prosperity leading to increased demand. 80% of human use is occurring in the community, either prescribed by healthcare providers or purchased directly without prescriptions (https://cddep.org/sites/default/files/swa_2015_final.pdf) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 30% of antibiotic prescriptions in the US are unnecessary (http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0503-unnecessary-prescriptions.html).

"Similarly, increasing prosperity has led to increasing demand for animal protein, which has led to intensive food animal production and the consequent greater use of antibiotics for prevention of infection and growth promotion of these food animals. More than 70% of the antibiotics used in the US are for animal husbandry (http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/legacy/uploadedfiles/phg/content_level_pages/issue_briefs/hhifibrecommendationsforfdafactsheetpdf.pdf).

"The increasing use of antibiotics in both human and veterinary practice and their careless discharge, often accompanied by antibiotic resistance genes, into the environment in pharmaceutical, industrial, farm, and human waste have contributed to the increasing presence of antibiotics in the environment. Although human and food animal consumption of antibiotics exerts selective pressure on microbial communities that reside in or on their bodies, the increasing presence of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in the environment can possibly exert selective pressure on microbial populations outside the body, but this requires further study (http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/52/1/5.full, http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0269749109002942, and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4034546/).

"Antibiotics can not only exert selective pressure for emergence of resistance to that and related antibiotics, an antibiotic may co-select for resistance to another class of antibiotics if either the same mechanism, that is, an efflux pump, provides resistance to both or if the resistance genes are linked and are co-selected. In addition, metals such as copper, fed to animals for growth promotion, or biocides such as triclosan may also co-select for resistance to antibiotics, such as colistin, whose resistance is genetically linked to that of the metal or biocide, even in the absence of exposure to that antibiotic (ProMED-mail post Antibiotic resistance - Portugal: colistin, MCR-1, Salmonella, Cu tolerance 20160703.4323241). Environmental pollution with these co-selecting agents may also exert selective pressure for emergence of antibiotic resistance." - Mod.ML

"Combating Antimicrobial Resistance through a 'One Health' Approach: Actions and OIE Strategy" was a main topic during the 84th General Session of the OIE (May 2016, Paris). See pages 23-31 in https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/About_us/docs/pdf/Session/2016/A_FR_2016_public.pdf.

The main points presented were:
"1. Antimicrobial resistance poses a threat to disease control throughout the world and is today a primary concern for human and animal health. This issue needs a whole-of-society engagement through a One-Health approach.
2. The OIE plays an active part in discussions on this subject in conjunction with other international organisations working in this field, in particular the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) under the tripartite agreement.
3. The responsible and prudent use of antimicrobials in both people and animals is crucial, not only in the interests of human health but also for animal health and animal welfare.
4. In this context the Global Action Plan developed by WHO, in collaboration with FAO and OIE, is primordial and Member Countries of the 3 organisations committed to develop National Action Plans accordingly.
5. The OIE works on antimicrobial resistance through different actions:
- Development and harmonisation of standards for legislation, prudent use and surveillance of antimicrobial agents;
- Training and education of animal health professionals;
- Surveillance of the resistance and data collection on the use of antimicrobial agents;
- Availability of good quality antimicrobials for veterinary medicinal products;
- Awareness and communication;
- And good governance and capacity building.
6. The OIE will pursue, develop and reinforce these actions through an OIE strategy for combating antimicrobial resistance that is in line with the implementation of the Global Action Plan."

Among the actions undertaken after the 84th General Session was the signing, in May 2018, of a tripartite memorandum of understanding between the OIE, FAO and WHO that focuses particularly on fighting antimicrobial resistance, the establishment of a new OIE department dedicated to antimicrobial resistance and veterinary products (headed by Dr. Elisabeth Erlacher-Vindel), and the nomination of an ad hoc group on antimicrobial resistance. The 2nd OIE Global Conference on "Antimicrobial Resistance and Prudent Use of Antimicrobial Agents in Animals" was held in Marrakesh (Morocco) in October 2018. The OIE has been heavily involved in the work of the United Nations Interagency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance.

AMR was discussed again during the recent 87th General Session of the OIE (Paris, May 2019), leading to resolution No. 14, "OIE's Engagement in the One Health Global Effort to Control Antimicrobial Resistance":

"CONSIDERING
1. That antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is globally recognised as a growing political concern with serious social, economic, human health and animal health repercussions, as demonstrated by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly Resolution A-71/3 adopted in 2016,
2. The 2nd OIE Global Conference on antimicrobial resistance and prudent use of antimicrobial agents, putting standards into practice, organised in October 2018 in Marrakesh, Morocco, that confirmed commitment to supporting global strategies and initiatives developed under the leadership of the Tripartite (FAO, OIE, WHO) and recommended to further strengthen international collaboration and coordination including with the World Bank, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and other related institutions to build a stronger economic case for sustainable investment,
3. The ongoing AMR activities in the framework of the Tripartite, following the Memorandum of Understanding signed in 2018, and its joint workplan to support countries in implementing National Action Plans in support of the Global Action Plan on AMR,
4. The Monitoring and Evaluation framework developed by the Tripartite to measure country progress in the implementation of the Global Action Plan using a harmonised approach,
5. The AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund 'Combatting the rising global threat of AMR through a One Health Approach' on the verge of being established by the Tripartite to enable joint resource mobilisation for the implementation of the Tripartite workplans on AMR,
6. The Ad hoc Inter-agency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (IACG) report, provided to the United Nations Secretary General in April 2019 after public consultation, and particularly its recommendations regarding global leadership and coordination on AMR, and calling on Member States to effectively address AMR by developing and implementing multisectoral One Health National Action Plans,
7. The upcoming UN Secretary General report prepared for the UN General Assembly in September 2019 in response to the Resolution A-71/3 to provide an update on progress made by Member States and the Tripartite on the implementation of the Political Declaration and recommendations emanating from the Ad-hoc Inter-Agency Coordination Group on Antimicrobial Resistance,
8. The OIE Strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance and the Prudent Use of Antimicrobials developed following the adoption of Resolution No. 36 at the 84th General Session in May 2016, which also considered previous Resolutions related to AMR and the harmonisation of registration requirements for veterinary drugs,
9. The recommendation to OIE Members, to follow the guidance of the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance, particularly by developing National Action Plans, in respect of the use of antimicrobial agents in animals adopted through Resolution No. 26 at the 83rd General Session in May 2015,
10. The importance and the relevance of the OIE standards, guidelines, tools and interventions carried out by the OIE to date in the fight against AMR, and the need to maintain its active involvement in Tripartite activities and to reaffirm its role in the global leadership regarding the challenge of AMR for animal health and welfare,

AND RECOGNISING the need to urgently implement the Tripartite Workplan on AMR supported by the Multi-Partner Trust Fund to further scale up the global effort and support to the countries and to strengthen OIE's capacity to respond to the growing challenge and expectations in addressing AMR,

THE ASSEMBLY RECOMMENDS THAT
1. The OIE continues to strengthen the central role of the Tripartite in engaging and coordinating all critical stakeholders at the global level through a Joint Tripartite Secretariat function, as well as through the AMR Multi-Partner Trust Fund, 'Combatting the rising global threat of AMR through a One Health Approach' while taking into account the most effective use of current resources and work streams,
2. The OIE further contributes to the rapid implementation of the recommendations emanating from the work of IACG and the UNGA, in accordance with the GAP and the OIE Strategy on addressing AMR,
3. The OIE regularly informs its Members of the global situation and progress made regarding the global use of antimicrobial agents in animals and the fight against AMR.

AND DECIDES THAT
The OIE Director General establishes a permanent Working Group on AMR supporting the implementation of the OIE Global Strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance and the Prudent Use of Antimicrobials and the organisation's capacity to respond to global challenges according to its mandate."

The paper discussed in this posting indicates several hotspots of microbial resistance: northeastern India, northeastern China, northern Pakistan, Iran, eastern Turkey, the south coast of Brazil, Egypt, the Red River delta in Viet Nam, and the areas surrounding Mexico City and Johannesburg, as well as areas where resistance is starting to emerge -- Kenya, Morocco, Uruguay, southern Brazil, central India, and southern China. All are OIE members, and their situation deserves the attention of OIE's newly established Antimicrobial Resistance department. - Mod.AS
