All horse movement across the Australian state of New South Wales has
been halted indefinitely, following an outbreak of equine flu,
throwing its racing and breeding industry into turmoil.
The New South Wales Minister for Primary Industries, Ian Macdonald,
cancelled race meetings on Saturday morning [25 Aug 2007], including
Randwick, after further tests confirmed that 11 horses have the
highly contagious disease, equine influenza.
Australia's billion dollar racing industry is in jeopardy of being
severely damaged. It is the 1st outbreak of the disease in the country.
The ABC reports 11 horses have been diagnosed with equine flu and a
further 700 have been quarantined in Sydney after the disease was
diagnosed in a stallion brought in from the northern hemisphere.
The results come only days after horses were locked down in Eastern
Creek in New South Wales and Spotswood in Victoria.
Saturday's [25 Aug 2007] Royal Randwick race meeting in Sydney has
been cancelled, affecting more than 40 000 people and costing
millions of dollars.

This is an increase in the number of horses affected. This is a very
infectious disease capable of moving rapidly. - Mod.TG]
