Argentina: Outbreak of Influenza Virus B/Hong Kong/330/01 in Children
-------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of a febrile respiratory syndrome was reported in San Pedro,
Misiones, Argentina (population of 23 000 inhabitants), between 1 and 26
Aug 2002. The 890 cases reported occurred primarily among school age
children and the main symptoms were fever, headache, myalgia, cough, and
generalized weakness. The diagnosis of influenza virus type B was confirmed
through one or more laboratory techniques, in 12 of the 18 patients studied.
Two patients showed evidence of a mixed infection by influenza B and A (H3)
viruses.
The isolation of the influenza B virus that affected the locality of San
Pedro de Misiones in Aug 2002, was subsequently characterized through
hemagglutination-inhibition, with the result being similar to that of
B/Hong Kong/330/01.
The field tests were carried out by personnel from the local health
department, the Epidemiology Department of the National Ministry of
Health's Residency Training Program in Field Epidemiology (PRESEC), and the
National Institute for Infectious Diseases (ANLIS) "Dr. Carlos G. Malbran".
