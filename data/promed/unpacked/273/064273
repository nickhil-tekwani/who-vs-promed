A 27-year-old New Brunswick man is the 1st in the province to die
after contracting an antiviral-resistant strain of H1N1 [presumably
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza virus infection], health officials in
the province stated.

The victim, a resident of Quispamsis, died at the Saint John Regional
Hospital on Monday [28 Dec 2009]. His death is the 8th and youngest
fatality associated with the [pandemic 2009] H1N1 virus in the
province, said Dr. Paul Van Buynder, New Brunswick's deputy chief
medical health officer. He was also the 1st person in the province to
have an H1N1 virus resistant to Tamiflu [oseltamivir], the most
common antiviral used to fight the infection, Van Buynder said.

Drug-resistant cases of H1N1 are rare and have only occurred several
dozen times across the world, Van Buynder said. The victim had a
history of asthma and pneumonia but did not get the H1N1 vaccine, his
parents say.

[It is presumed that the deceased patient was infected initially by
an oseltamivir-resistant variant of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009
influenza virus, and that resistant variant did not appear during
treatment. However, it is unclear from this press report whether the
patient had been treated with the drug prior to his death.
Clarification would be welcomed.

North Korea has sent out a nationwide alert in recent days about the
apparent worsening spread of H1N1 flu [presumably pandemic (H1N1)
2009 influenza virus infection] according to an aid group with
contacts in the country.

The notice by the Seoul-based Buddhist aid group Good Friends follows
the South Korean government's shipment of 400 000 doses of the flu
treatment [drug] Tamiflu and 100 000 doses of Relenza to its
impoverished neighbor on 18 Dec 2009 amid fears that a delayed
response to the disease in the North could lead to serious
consequences for the South.

Good Friends said this week that North Korean officials had issued a
statement that patients suffering from the disease should be given
priority. The group said the statement was of a type issued only
twice before, for seriously wounded soldiers during the 1950-1953
Korean War and for a deadly skirmish with South Korea in 2002.

The true picture within highly restrictive North Korea is difficult
to determine. Officials there couldn't be reached. On 9 Dec 2009,
North Korea's official Korea Central News Agency confirmed that 9
people had contracted the virus, also known as swine flu [pandemic
(H1N1) 2009 influenza virus infection], in the capital Pyongyang and
in the city of Sinuiju.

South Korean officials, who met with their North Korean counterparts
during the flu-treatment shipments, said they were unclear on the
situation. Lee Jong-joo, a deputy spokeswoman for South Korea's
Unification Ministry, which handles relations with the North, said
that the fact that North Korea officially disclosed it is fighting
the virus suggests it could be serious. "North Korean officials we
met at that time said the country is setting up a tight
disease-control system and getting itself ready for an outbreak in
the country," she said on Wednesday [30 Dec 2009]. North Korean
officials were "very grateful" for the South's donated treatments,
said Kim Young-il, a manager at the ministry's humanitarian aid team.

South Korea's aid to the North has dwindled since President Lee
Myung-bak took office in 2008. Mr. Lee tied aid to progress in talks
to halt North Korea's pursuit of nuclear weapons. Talks have been
slowed by Pyongyang's delaying tactics. Amid recent peace overtures
by the North, the South Korean government said Monday [28 Dec 2009]
it would provide North Korea with USD 22 million in general
humanitarian aid.

"Medication shipment alone is not enough. Since the infection is
closely related to nutrition, the Seoul government should allow civil
groups to resume their private aid works to efficiently fight against
the disease," said Lee Woo-young, a professor at the University of
North Korean Studies.

According to the World Health Organization, pandemic H1N1 has caused
at least 11 500 deaths worldwide. But activity has been declining in
much of the world, including East Asia, it said.
