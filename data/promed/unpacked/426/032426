Bacterial disease blamed for dead fish on Wilson, Wheeler
---------------------------------------------------------
A bacterial disease related to high water temperatures is being blamed
for the deaths of thousands of catfish on Wheeler and Wilson lakes in
recent weeks, conservation officials said Monday [22 Aug 2011].

Keith Floyd, a supervising fisheries biologist for the Alabama
Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, said he began
receiving reports of dead catfish on Wheeler Lake near Decatur about a
month ago. He received a report Monday about dead catfish found during
the weekend in Wilson Lake, in the Shoals.

Killen resident Mike Zacharski said about 300 dead catfish floated
past his home on Wilson Lake on Monday morning.

"They were spread out over about a mile and stretched almost from
bank-to-bank. It's was pretty spooky looking," Zacharski said. "There
were some huge fish. Several looked like they weighed more than 20
pounds."

Zacharski said he began noticing dead catfish along the shoreline and
floating in the lake about 3 weeks ago. Monday was the 1st time he saw
hundreds floating in a group. Floyd said the fish are dying from
columnaris disease [_Flavobacterium columnare_], which is caused by a
bacteria that becomes more active when water temperatures are high.

"We usually see this when the water is very warm," Floyd said. "The
warm water helps the bacteria multiply, plus it causes stress for the
fish. The combination of more bacteria and heat stress makes the fish
more susceptible to being infected."

Water temperatures in local lakes were in the lower 90s earlier this
month. Those temperatures are now in the upper 80s.

Barry Ray, who lives on Wilson Lake, said he began noticing dead
catfish floating in the lake about 3 weeks ago. "At 1st, it was just
big catfish, 20- to 30-pounders, but lately I've been seeing a lot of
small catfish, too," Ray said. "They're real scattered; you see a few
here and then a few there, perhaps 10 to 15 in a 1/4-mile circle."

So far, catfish are the only fish reportedly dying. Floyd said blue
catfish make up a majority of those killed to this point. "This
disease can be very species specific," Floyd said. "When we see it
around here, it usually hits catfish." Floyd is unsure why catfish are
typically targeted by the disease in the Tennessee River. He said the
disease can kill any species of fish.

Fish infected with columnaris disease often have sores on their skin
and gills.

Now that water temperatures are cooling, Floyd said the problem should
being winding down. "It's already gone on longer than we expected," he
said. "It's kind of like the flu bug going through a school where a
few kids get sick at 1st and then more and more until it peaks and
starts winding down. Hopefully we're seeing the peak of the fish kills
and they are going to start tapering off."

Floyd said he does not expect long-term damage to the catfish
populations on either lake. "I had a friend who went fishing over the
weekend close to Browns Ferry and was catching catfish left and
right," Floyd said. "So far, it does not seem to have hurt the catfish
population."

The disease is not known to infect humans who swim in lakes where the
bacteria is present, conservation officials said.

Zacharski continues to go swimming in Wilson Lake, but finds it
increasingly difficult because of the dead fish. "When I'm out there
swimming, I'm having to duck and dodge the dead catfish that are
floating by," he said.

[Columnaris disease is the 2nd leading cause of mortality in pond
raised catfish in the southeastern United States. It is 2nd only to
enteric septicemia of catfish (ESC) caused by the bacterium
_Edwardsiella ictaluri_. Most species of fish are susceptible to
columnaris following some type of environmental stress and when water
temperatures are in the upper part of their preferred temperature
range. The disease commonly occurs in channel catfish when water
temperatures are in the range of 25 to 32 C (77 to 90 F) in the
spring, summer and fall.

Columnaris, 1st described by Herbert Spencer Davis in 1922, is one of
the oldest known diseases of warm water fish. References to the
disease can be confusing. The causative bacterium has been referred to
by different names including _Bacillus columnaris_, _Flexibacter
columnaris_, _Cytophaga columnaris_, and most recently _Flavobacterium
columnare_.

Temperatures have been hot for prolonged period across much of the
United States. Many lakes, streams and bays are reported to be above
normal temperatures and swimmers indicate it is like being in a warm
bathtub. When water temperatures are high, fish are stressed, and
bacteria thrive.
