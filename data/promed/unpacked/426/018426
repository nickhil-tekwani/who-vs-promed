AI cuts exports
---------------
Thailand's chicken exports will slide 21.9 per cent in 2004 because as a
result of the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza that swept Asia
earlier in the year, according to a Dow Jones Newswire report that cited
economists at Thailand's Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. The
value of the lost chicken exports was USD 965 million. Thailand is the 4th
largest chicken exporter in the world behind the United States, Brazil, and
China.
Many countries banned imports of Thai chickens after the AI outbreak in
Thailand was confirmed on 23 Jan 2004. However, cooked chicken products are
being imported by some major buyers such as Japan and countries belonging
to the European Union, which consume 39 and 54 per cent, respectively, of
Thai cooked chicken exports, a Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives
statement said.
The Ministry expects exports of cooked chicken to surpass exports of raw
chicken in 2004. Cooked chicken exports will rise to 220 000 to 230 000
tons from 128 000 tons in 2003, while frozen chicken exports will fall to
170 000 tons from 380 000 tons, the statement said.
Chicken production in Thailand is still only about 40 to 50 per cent of the
normal rate. Several farm areas are still being monitored for any
reappearance of the bird flu virus before they can resume operations. The
government ordered the culling of thousands of chickens earlier in 2004 in
a plan to eradicate the AI virus.

Avian influenza (Low pathogenic), TAIPEI CHINA: Final report
------------------------------------------------------------
The following final report, signed by Dr Jye Chang, dean, Department of
Veterinary Medicine, National Chung Hsing University, was published by the
OIE on 21 Apr 2004:
The strain of avian influenza (H5N2) detected in routine surveillance from
24 premises of 8 prefectures has been completely eradicated. The birds
totaled 383 852 were stamped out and the affected premises have been
cleaned and disinfected. Based on the results of genetic sequencing
(PQREKR*GLF) and intravenous pathogenicity index (IVPI=0.0), the virus was
identified as a low pathogenic avian influenza virus.
Extensive surveillance has been conducted in the buffer zone (3 km radius)
around the index flock. Serological as well as cloacal and tracheal samples
(for virus isolation) were collected from all flocks (both non-commercial
and commercial) within the buffer zone. This targeted surveillance has not
detected any further evidence of the virus since 9 Mar, 2004.
Note: Low pathogenic avian influenza has not been coded in OIE.

[Unlike the recent outbreaks in 8 other Eastern Asian countries, which were
affected by a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus strain of
subtype H5N1, the outbreak in Taipei was caused by a low pathogenic (LPAI)
strain, of subtype H5N2. Though this was not a list A disease, severe and
swift eradication programme was performed. - Mod.AS]
