A type of lectin in red kidney beans was behind an outbreak in Denmark earlier this year [2020]. Poisoning left 45 people sick, including 24 on one day, in late April [2020]. The outbreak was limited to a catering company delivering food for another business in the Copenhagen area.

The outbreak was caused by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) in frozen red kidney beans from Turkey, via Sweden.

Nikolas Kuhn Hove, head of crises management at the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen), said it appeared the kidney beans weren't boiled long enough.

"We have one day where people got sick quite quickly because the source of the outbreak, we believe, is red kidney beans that weren't boiled for long enough to reduce the toxins. We got reports about people getting ill; we visited the place and saw their menu plan. We saw there were salads with kidney beans," he told Food Safety News.

"We dug into the product, and it was labeled as pre-cooked kidney beans; we took samples of the kidney bean salad and, based on symptoms the patients had, it looked like it was some kind of poisoning. We directed our investigations to what kind of meals they had in the week, and we did interviews with all patients asking them what they had eaten on what dates, and in the investigation, the kidney bean salad was significant."

Symptoms of poisoning include vomiting and diarrhea within a few hours of eating beans that weren't cooked long enough to reduce this lectin; symptoms last for a few hours. Only a few beans are needed to cause poisoning.

Kuhn Hove said Denmark has had such incidents 3 or 4 times during the past year to 18 months.

"Compared to a normal outbreak, it is big, as it is a lunch catering service. We see these lunch catering service outbreaks from time to time, and we can see this in our statistics because catering companies providing lunch are getting bigger; the outbreaks they make are also getting bigger, but they are normally point source: a single day where something has gone wrong," he said.

"We also see this more due to the rise in vegan and plant-based meat substitutes. Like if you make a lasagna without meat, you would normally add beans to it, and in these situations, catering companies tend to buy pre-cooked beans."

In the April [2020] outbreak, the producer of beans is thought to have used blanching for 10-15 minutes, but they needed at least 30-45 minutes of cooking, according to officials.

Kuhn Hove said because the beans were produced in another country, the labeling was translated a few times.

"In this case, it looks as if blanched has been lost in translation into pre-cooked, and the catering company bought a product that was not what they expected. The most difficult part was tracking down whether these beans were pre-cooked or not. [Also,] who was responsible for the correct labeling of the product, and how we can ensure this was corrected," he said.

"It was difficult to figure out how to put the right measures in place to avoid the same case happening again, because the product was moved through several countries. The producer has made a final product that is legal and safe, but it has to be handled correctly all the way through the chain."

Problems due to translation is one of a number of things the authority has a focus on, said Kuhn Hove.

"With the increased focus and demand on end products, this is an issue other authorities and companies should be aware of to make sure products are safe. In the food sector, we have had the trend of eating meat cooked in an oven where the temperature is not hot enough to kill bacteria. We also have products used in a new way or by people who are not used to dealing with such products, and it takes new or additional focus to ensure it is produced in a safe manner."

["Lectins are proteins that selectively bind carbohydrates and, importantly, the carbohydrate moieties of the glycoproteins decorating the surface of most animal [and mammal] cells. They are found in a wide range of vegetables (29 out of 88 tested; [1]). Plant lectins that are not efficiently degraded by digestive enzymes, and that have an affinity for the surface of gut epithelial cells, such as those present in the Leguminosae family, can be poisonous [2]. Acute symptoms following ingestion include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

"Ingestion of the lectins present in certain improperly cooked vegetables [especially beans and lentils] can result in acute gastrointestinal (GI) tract distress, but the mechanism of toxicity is unknown. In vivo, gut epithelial cells are constantly exposed to mechanical and other stresses, and consequently, individual cells frequently experience plasma membrane disruptions. Repair of these cell surface disruptions allows the wounded cell to survive; failure results in necrotic cell death. Plasma membrane repair is mediated, in part, by an exocytotic event that adds a patch of internal membrane to the defect site. Lectins are known to inhibit exocytosis.

"Repair of plasma membrane disruptions and exocytosis of mucus was assessed after treatment of cultured cell models and excised segments of the GI tract with lectins. Plasma membrane disruptions were produced by focal irradiation of individual cells, using a microscope-based laser, or by mechanical abrasion of multiple cells, using a syringe needle. Repair was then assessed by monitoring the cytosolic penetration of dyes incapable of crossing the intact plasma membrane. We found cell surface-bound lectins potently inhibited plasma membrane repair, and the exocytosis of mucus normally accompanies the repair response."

One note: Be sure to discard the water the lentils or beans were soaked in. Fresh water should be added for cooking the lentils/beans. The taste of soaked vs. unsoaked beans may not vary much, but apparently the effect on the GI tract is much different.

It seems the investigation's conclusion of incorrect understanding or mistaken translation of the label regarding blanched beans vs. fully cooked beans was the true crux of the problem. Perhaps the label should say further cooking needed, as the beans in question were not ready for consumption without further cooking. - Mod.TG
