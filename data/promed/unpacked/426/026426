Avian influenza - situation in Cambodia as of 9 Feb 2005 - WHO Update 9
-----------------------------------------------
Officials from the Ministry of Health of Cambodia and the World
Health Organization (WHO) have stepped up surveillance in Kampot
Province, the scene of Cambodia's 1st human case of avian influenza.
Meanwhile, Cambodian officials have begun traveling from village to
village in the region, warning about the dangers of infected poultry,
while a local radio station has been making hourly broadcasts on the
need to take precautions. People have been told they should avoid
unnecessary contact with infected poultry, especially de-feathering
or preparing sick birds for consumption in an area with recent
chicken deaths.
Health centers in Kampot Province are now using a common case
definition for suspected avian influenza patients and have been
advised to alert the authorities about any suspect cases.
The Cambodian Ministry of Health confirmed over the weekend that a
25-year-old woman from Kampot Province, who died in Viet Nam on 30
Jan 2005, was positive for influenza A/H5 virus. The woman's
14-year-old brother died after experiencing respiratory symptoms and
is suspected to have been infected with avian influenza. However, no
diagnostic samples were collected before his cremation. No other
people, including the woman's family and close contacts, have so far
tested positive. All of the case's close contacts will remain under
observation until Mon 14 Feb 2005, when 2 incubation periods will
have passed.
In order to clarify how the woman became infected, additional
laboratory and epidemiological investigations are ongoing in
collaboration with the Pasteur Institute, Phnom Penh, the Cambodian
Ministry of Agriculture, and the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO). At this stage, there is no evidence of human-to-human
transmission.
"WHO is encouraged by Cambodia's response," said Dr. Jim Tulloch,
WHO's Representative in Cambodia. "Increased efforts to educate the
public about avian influenza will be crucial in the detection and
control of any future outbreak. There is no way to accurately predict
what lies ahead, but by putting emphasis on surveillance, WHO and the
Cambodian government are investing in the best response to any
potential outbreak: preparedness." WHO continues to work closely with
the Cambodian Government and partners, including the FAO, to monitor
the situation.
