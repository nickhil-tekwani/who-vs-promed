Hospitals in the south west of France have reported a growing number
of poisoning cases from people who have picked inedible mushrooms.
Health authorities in Aquitaine and the Midi-Pyrenees say many of the
people affected are tourists who have benefited from the abundance of
early mushrooms this year [2011] but have not taken the necessary
precautions.

Some 30 cases of poisoning have been reported in the Tarn-et-Garonne
in recent days and 21 in the Lot.

Symptoms include abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Recovery is
normally quick, after 24 hours of rehydration.

The commonest cause is the bolet de Satan (Satan's mushroom), which
has a pale dull-colored cap and red-patterned stalk, and which some
people have confused with the edible cepe de Bordeaux.

It is important that mushroom-pickers seek advice from a pharmacist if
they are not sure whether their collection is safe to eat.

The Lot prefecture says you should also avoid putting mushrooms in
plastic bags because they rot quicker and avoid picking near busy
roads.

Two different varieties should not be stored together, to avoid
cross-contamination, and mushrooms should be washed thoroughly, cut
into small pieces, and cooked for at least 20 minutes.

If you fall ill, you should call the Samu [Service d'Aide Medicale
Urgente; urgent medical aid service] on 15 or your nearest
anti-poisioning centre (centre antipoison).

Weather conditions in the past months have caused an abundance of
early mushrooms. Health authorities point out that it is tempting to
pick mushrooms, but it is essential to know them to avoid poisoning.
Since 1 Jul 2011, 388 cases of poisoning have been reported.
Vacationers and walkers have inadvertently eaten Satan's mushrooms
that they have confused with the edible mushrooms known as cepes or
boletus. These cases have been reported by poison control and toxic
centers in the Aquitaine, Midi-Pyrenees, and Rhone Alpes regions.

After eating Satan's mushrooms, nausea, diarrhea and vomiting can
occur. Hospitalization for a few hours can prevent dehydration. To
avoid poisoning, it is strongly recommended to have the mushrooms
checked by a specialist, either a pharmacist or a mycology
association, especially since other poisonous mushrooms in our
forests, such as _Amanita phalloides_, are fatal.

It is strongly recommended to pick up the mushrooms with your foot and
your hat for easy identification by specialists. Do not use plastic
bags, as this can cause fermentation and make them unfit for
consumption. Place the mushrooms in 2 baskets or 2 boxes: one for the
varieties that you are sure you have identified, the 2nd for those of
which you are unsure. Thus, you will avoid a possible
cross-contamination. Once refrigerated, the authorities recommend that
the mushrooms be eaten within 2 days.

[Mushrooms are tasty, fascinating, beautiful, and can be deadly. While
collecting the delicate morsels on our own is greatly rewarding, it
can be dangerous.

Correct identification of mushrooms can be tedious, as many closely
resemble many others. Overall color, cap shape and color, spore shape
and color, the time of year, weather conditions, geographical
locations, display of annular rings on the stems, and many other
factors must be considered.

It is unwise for anyone not from the area to be out collecting
mushrooms without consulting a trained professional. Just asking the
local grocer may not be enough to prevent a hospitalization or even
death.
