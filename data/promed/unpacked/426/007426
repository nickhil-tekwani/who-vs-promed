FDA seizes adulterated crabmeat in Louisiana containing chloramphenicol
-----------------------------------------------
At the request of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), USA marshals
seized approximately 1144 cases of Bernard's brand frozen crab meat, while
it was being held for sale at Southern Cold Storage Company, Baton Rouge,
LA, USA, on 2 Jul 2004, because it was adulterated with an unapproved food
additive, chloramphenicol. The marshals seized approximately 304 cases of
pasteurized special white crab meat, 200 cases of pasteurized special claw
crab meat, and 640 cases of pasteurized jumbo lump crab meat. Imported from
China, the frozen crab meat has an estimated value of USD 86 944.
In accordance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, food products
that contain chloramphenicol are considered adulterated, and are not
permitted to be sold in, or imported into, the United States.
Chloramphenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic drug used to treat life-
threatening infections in humans, usually when other alternatives are not
available. The use of this antibiotic is limited because of its potentially
life-threatening side-effect: idiosyncratic aplastic anemia. For the very
small percentage of the population susceptible to this side-effect,
exposure to chloramphenicol could be serious, or, even life-threatening.
Because of the current uncertainty regarding the dose-response relationship
between chloramphenicol ingestion and aplastic anemia, it is not possible
to define a safe level for the presence of this antibiotic in food products.
In Jun 2002 (see below), FDA announced increased sampling of imported
seafood for the presence of chloramphenicol. This action was taken because
some states, and other countries, had detected low levels of
chloramphenicol in imported shrimp and crayfish. The agency will continue
to detain or seize any food imports that contain chloramphenicol to ensure
that this product is not released for human or animal consumption in the
United States.

[The following discussion is extracted from the moderation of the 2002
ProMED posting regarding chloramphenicol in honey and was written by
moderators MPP and LL:
"Chloramphenicol was a commonly used antibacterial agent in the 1950s and,
like other antimicrobials in use today, was commonly used in situations
where no specific antibiotic is required (such as in a viral respiratory
infection). Bone marrow toxicity was recognized to be associated with
chloramphenicol in 2 ways: (1) a dose-dependent reversible marrow
depression that disappears when the drug is stopped, and (2), an
idiosyncratic reaction that causes irreversible marrow failure (albeit
quite rarely) that is not dose-dependent and may occur at quite low drug
levels. It is this latter idiosyncratic form that is of concern in this
scenario. It should be noted that cases of the idiosyncratic reaction have
been described following the use of chloramphenicol eye drops. - Mod. LL
In Jan 2002, chloramphenicol was detected in animal feed in Europe (see
ProMED- mail postings listed below). This contamination was traced to
fish/seafood products coming from the Far East. There is a commentary from
the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture on the "Draft Report for the Residue
Control in Live Animals and Animal Products by EC Inspection Mission to
China" at
<http://www.agri.gov.cn/english/e02.htm>.
It mentions that chloramphenicol was discontinued from the Chinese
Veterinary Pharmarcopoeia in 2000. An investigation into the contamination
of shrimp revealed. 'The prawn-peeling workers had not worn protective
gloves in the past, causing an itchy symptom on their hands, so some of
the workers used chloromycetin (chloramphenicol) to treat their hands in
order to avoid the itching, and, as a result, the prawns were polluted.' -
Mod MPP"
The 2002 FDA report regarding chloramphenicol testing in imported seafood
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~lrd/fpshrimp.html>
contains this discussion: Until recently, the sensitivity of the
methodology to detect chloramphenicol in shrimp could find the drug down to
5 parts per billion (ppb). Recently, Canada, and the European Union (EU),
have refined their methods to detect even lower levels, and, have taken
action on food products from China and Viet Nam found to be contaminated by
chloramphenicol. The FDA has modified its methodology to confirm
chloramphenicol levels in shrimp and crayfish to 1ppb and is further
modifying the methods to detect 0.3 ppb, which will place the U.S.
methodology in line with Canada and the EU.
The new methodology for testing for chloramphenicol to the level of 1 ppb
will be used to test imported shrimp and crayfish that are suspected to
contain chloramphenicol. FDA will detain, and refuse entry to, any product
it identifies, and confirms, as containing chloramphenicol.
On 5-6 Jun 2002, a senior delegation of Chinese officials met with the FDA
to discuss the issue of chloramphenicol residues in shrimp and crayfish.
The delegation informed the FDA that, on 5 Mar 2002, China banned the use
of chloramphenicol in animals and animal feeds. They also informed the FDA
that they are initiating testing of shrimp, crayfish, and other
animal-derived foods intended for export, to ensure the absence of
chloramphenicol and other drug residues. The FDA and China exchanged
information on testing methodologies. The FDA informed the Chinese
officials that the Agency would take enforcement action against products
found to be in violation. - Mod.LL]
