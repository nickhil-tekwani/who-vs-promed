France: Human Case of Rabies in a Child Following a Visit to Gabon
-----------------------------------------------
A human case of rabies was reported by the Institut de Veille Sanitaire on
22 Oct 2003, in a 3-year-old child who was admitted to hospital with
encephalitis in the Lyon region, in the east of France. The child was very
likely infected in August 2003, when he played with unvaccinated dogs
during a visit to Gabon.
All the child's contacts were informed by the local health authorities in
the Rhone, and have had individual medical care at the Antirabies Centre in
Lyon, in order to evaluate the necessity of antirabies vaccination. These
measures were taken as a precaution, since the risk of transmission cannot
be completely excluded for those in close contact with the child, including
the healthcare workers who treated him. However, no transmission between
humans has ever been reported outside of a very few cases by corneal graft.
Since 1977, 19 cases of rabies have been seen in humans in France, all of
whom contracted their infection in endemic areas outside France. The last
autochthonous [human] case in France was seen in 1924. This is a useful
reminder that rabies cases continue to be imported into Europe from the
many countries where rabies is still endemic in the animal population.

[The campaigns for oral immunization of foxes in France since 1986, using
baits containing vaccinia-rabies recombinant virus, have resulted in the
eradication of rabies in wild carnivores. Domestic dog rabies is also today
an imported disease. All human cases of rabies are the result of exposure
outside France. Bat rabies remains a reality in France, however, but it
does not impinge on the human population. Both European bat virus strains
and African virus strains, carried by imported tropical bats, have been
recorded. - Mod.CP]
