We had been responsible for the preparation of the medical personnel
of the German Contingents on infectious diseases in the Kosovo area
and we, of course, mentioned the possible CCHF threat there.
Before giving a warning to the doctors in the field and the commanding
officers and initiating an alert on that CCHF case, it is important to know
more details. When? Where? Who? Which circumstances? Laboratory
confirmed? There are a lot of possible differential diagnoses.

It's true that Kosovo is within the CCHF zone. But I think that is
more likely that the "fever" is due to one of the hantaviruses which
are widespread in the area. See LeDuc et al.

Given the activity of CCHF elsewhere, it might well be [CCHF
-- CCHF is well documented in the area -- and the nosocomial danger
needs to be looked at.
However, the possibility of HFRS from Dobrava is also there. There
has been a lot more HFRS diagnosed than CCHF in the last decade
(good for betting, but not so good for knowing what's really going on).

[CJ is referring to hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, caused
by Dobrava virus. Bo Niklasson, do you have a comment? - Mod.JW
