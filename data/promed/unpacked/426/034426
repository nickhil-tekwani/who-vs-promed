This describes an attempt to investigate the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 infection in hospital inpatients in Italy. Out of 148 patients, 60 were excluded because they had received medication. Among the remaining 88, 18 (20%) had cutaneous manifestations, eight of them at the onset, 10 after hospitalisation. Fourteen had an erythematous rash, three had widespread urticaria, and one had chickenpox-like vesicles. The authors speculate that the cutaneous manifestations are similar to those of other common viral infections.

In response to the outbreak of COVID-19, we set up a team to carry out sampling in the community. This enabled individuals to remain in self-isolation in their own homes and to prevent healthcare settings and services from being overwhelmed by admissions for sampling of suspected cases. There is evidence that this is a cost effective, safe and necessary service to complement COVID-19 testing in hospitals.

[3] Tuberculosis vaccine to be used against Coronavirus

The course of the corona pandemic depends heavily on how quickly drugs or vaccines against the new coronavirus can be developed. But a vaccine is a long time coming. Although 47 projects are under way worldwide, it can no longer be expected this year [2020]. The test and approval procedures take too long before a vaccine is really so safe and effective that it can be used on millions of people. German researchers now want to bridge the time and try to protect particularly vulnerable people, with a vaccine against tuberculosis.

BCG based vaccine
-----------------
The vaccine is called VPM1002 and was developed by scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin. In a large-scale study, several clinics in Germany are to test whether the tuberculosis vaccine also works against Covid-19. This has been announced by the Max Planck Society (MPG).

In particular, older people and healthcare workers should be vaccinated. The vaccine "could thus help to bridge the time until a vaccine that is specifically effective against SARS-Co-Virus 2", according to the MPG announcement.

The vaccine is based on another vaccine, BCG, that was developed in the early 20th century. "Studies in mice show that the BCG vaccine can not only protect against tuberculosis, but also against viral infections of the respiratory tract," says the MPG. Mice suffering from flu have fewer influenza A viruses in their blood if previously vaccinated with BCG and show less damage to the lungs.

There are indications from the Netherlands and Great Britain that BCG could also help against the new coronavirus. Vaccination apparently activates the immune system against a viral infection. As a result, the vaccine reduces the risk of serious illnesses and lowers the death rate.

Researchers hope vaccine will alleviate symptoms
------------------------------------------------
The new vaccine was developed at the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology in Berlin, based on the old BCG vaccine. According to the researchers, it contains weakened tuberculosis-like bacteria. These are genetically modified so that immune cells can recognize them better. The vaccine is safer and more effective than the old one and should therefore be used in newborns and to refresh a vaccination in adults.

The researchers hope that the new vaccine will be able to alleviate the symptoms of infection with the novel coronavirus. In addition, it can be manufactured using the latest production methods, said Adar C Poonawalla, the manufacturer and managing director of Serum Institute of India. "Millions of cans could be made available in a very short time."

According to its own statements, the Max Planck Society granted the license for the vaccine to the biotechnology company Vakzine Projekt Management (VPM) in Hanover in 2004. From 2012, the company continued to develop the vaccine together with the Serum Institute of India, one of the largest vaccine manufacturers worldwide. The partners have had "promising talks with the authorities" to conduct a so-called phase III study in Germany with the vaccine VPM1002 and to investigate the effectiveness of the vaccine in older people and healthcare workers, said MPG.

"These populations are particularly affected by the current pandemic," said Leander Grode, VPM's managing director. They could therefore particularly benefit from vaccination. If the result is positive, the vaccine could help relieve the burden on health systems until a specific vaccine is available.

[BCG, the live attenuated vaccine against tuberculosis (TB), is one of the world's most widely used vaccines and continues to be the only vaccine used to prevent TB. It contains an attenuated strain of the bovine tubercle bacillus _Mycobacterium bovis_ and was first introduced in humans in 1921. BCG is used to induce immunity against TB and is part of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) with more than 100 million children vaccinated with BCG every year. Universal vaccination at birth with a single dose of BCG is recommended in developing countries where TB is highly endemic or where there is high risk of exposure to TB. Because of the declining incidence of TB in Europe and the United States, BCG immunization is mostly recommended for high-risk groups in these regions. A database of global BCG vaccination policies and practices can be found online. Epidemiologic studies have linked early life BCG immunization to an unanticipated reduction (approx. 50%) in all-cause mortality, which greatly exceeds a reduction in mortality attributable to TB. These observations suggest BCG induces heterologous protection against antigenically diverse, unrelated pathogens. One of the suggested mechanisms for heterologous protection against infection in the context of BCG vaccination is innate immune memory, also known as "trained immunity" https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.00332/full. These observations are quite interesting and perhaps may boost protective immunity against COVID-19. - Mod.UBA]

[4] Host susceptibility studies
Date: Thu 26 Mar 2020

https://www.genomeweb.com/sequencing/covid-19-host-susceptibility-studies-ramp-internationally?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium =email&utm_campaign=GWDN%20Thurs%20PM%202020-03-26&utm_term=GW%20Daily%20News %20Bulletin# .XoHVC4 gzbIU


The current COVID-19 pandemic has presented researchers and clinicians with confounding contradictions: while the disease poses a well-documented risk to elderly individuals and those with some preexisting health conditions, for example, it has also been linked to severe disease or death in some younger adults.

On the other hand, as ever more individuals are tested, investigators are finding ever more SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with mild symptoms, atypical symptoms, or no symptoms at all -- seemingly healthy people who might inadvertently spread and amplify the disease. Though yet-to-be-identified environmental or lifestyle factors may contribute to these dramatically different infection outcomes, it seems increasingly likely that we will need to dig into the core of our own biology to fully explain this variability.

That realization has members of the genomics community gearing up to do hypothesis-free and hypothesis-driven research -- both locally and within collaborations springing up, virtually, across borders -- to search for potential host contributors to SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility, in the hopes of finding genetic markers for COVID-19 progression and biological insights that might point to potential drug targets.

For one of these efforts, known as the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, investigators from more than 2-dozen existing studies, research centers, or biobanks in Europe, the UK, Asia, and North America are teaming up to share data and analyses done on COVID-19 patients in a "bottom-up" manner.

In practice, that means investigators at participating sites are tapping into their own expertise and resources to assess host genetic contributors to infection -- from analyzing genetic features in biobank participants who happen to become infected with SARS-CoV-2 to prospectively collecting samples from infected patients for genotyping, genome sequencing, RNA sequencing, immune assays, or other approaches.

"There are some people who will need to start a new collection [for the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative]," explained Andrea Ganna, a European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) group leader in human genomics with the University of Helsinki's Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM). "For example, in Italy there are no big biobanks." "Some other people, through the global biobank network that already exists, will use these networks to identify cases in their biobank and then send in the data," he added. At his own center in Finland, investigators plan to genotype germline samples from individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, including patients treated at several hospitals in Italy.

Collaborators at the University of Siena have already secured ethics approval to start consenting and collecting samples from its COVID-19 patients there, Ganna explained, and other hospitals in northern Italy are seeking similar approval. Once the initiative is fully under way, a center in Siena will take in patient samples from 11 participating hospitals to do the host DNA extraction step before shipping that DNA to FIMM for genotyping.

Ganna is hoping that a "quick and dirty" genotyping analysis could lead to patient management, diagnostic, or drug repurposing clues, though researchers at FIMM have not ruled out the possibility of doing more in-depth genome sequencing, exome sequencing, or immunological assay analyses on the samples from Italy in the future.

In the meantime, the investigators are reaching out to teams elsewhere to find strategies for harmonizing and analyzing data as it is generated on patients in other parts of the world. They are also drawing from their experience so far to help others come up with consistent informed consent, IRB, and sample collection protocols. "The idea is that if we bring people together ... and people can brainstorm, then we can harmonize across different collections," Ganna said. "That's really the key, harmonization." Researchers at Stanford University were among the 1st to sign on to the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative effort.

Though the details are still being hammered out, that team expects to tap into a clinical genome sequencing service that is about to go live at Stanford to sequence samples from COVID-19 patients treated there, explained Carlos Bustamante, a population genetics, biomedical data science, and genomics researcher at Stanford. Researchers there are particularly interested in understanding if, and how,SARS-CoV-2 viral load might impact patient outcomes, he noted, since preliminary work out of China suggests that the sickest COVID-19 patients may have particularly high levels of the virus.

The group is also building on the extensive experience gained in prior population and disease genomic research to search for informative common polymorphisms, protective loss-of-function mutations, and other genetic factors that may coincide with individuals' propensity for SARS-CoV-2 infection or progression.

"One of the things that we've learned from human genetics is that there are extremes at the human phenotype distribution, and pathogen susceptibility is no different," Bustamante said. "There are going to be people who are particularly susceptible and there are going to be those who are particularly resistant [to SARS-CoV-2]. For the common polymorphisms -- which is what I think we would initially look for -- the low-pass sequencing would work great as well as genotyping directly on arrays," he said. "And then we can always throttle up the coverage to get at rarer and rarer variants."

The Stanford team will likely use additional tools such as RNA sequencing to dig into host immune responses and viral sequence details, and Bustamante noted that assays to test infection features such as viral load could evolve relatively quickly out of growing genomic datasets.

Biomedical data science researcher Manuel Rivas, who is leading the Stanford arm of the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, noted that analytical resources that have already been developed for other research may prove useful for the coming COVID-19 patient analyses. "Obviously the most challenging part right now is how to you start integrating that data in the setting where it is an emergency situation," Rivas said, noting that "the analysis plan is starting to be worked out." Both Rivas and Bustamante credit Stanford collaborators such as Euan Ashley and Benjamin Pinsky with helping to move the work along.

At McGill University in Quebec, Canada, meanwhile, human genetics, epidemiology, and biostatistics clinician investigator Brent Richards is part of a COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative-contributing team that is putting together a province-wide COVID-19 patient biobank for genomic profiling with funding from Quebec's provincial government. "We will collect DNA, RNA and other biological specimens on COVID-19 positive patients and those who have been tested, but are negative," Richards explained in an email. "We anticipate this biobank will contain samples and data from thousands of participants, which will provide evidence to improve clinical care during this pandemic."

Not everyone is looking quite so broadly across the host genome. Other teams have already demonstrated the potential for hypothesis-driven susceptibility studies. Still others are looking at the potential influence of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region or other sources of immune variability from one individual to the next.

Together with blood group data for tens of thousands of unaffected individuals from the broader populations in Wuhan and Shenzhen, the patient profiles hinted at a potential protective effect for the O blood group. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infections appeared to be significantly more common in individuals with blood group A, the team reported. Because data are being generated quickly in an emergency setting and much of studies are not yet peer-reviewed due, he added, "the best rule here is cross-validate, cross-validate, cross-validate."

[5] A genomic survey of SARS-CoV-2 reveals multiple introductions into Northern California without a predominant lineage
Date: Mon 30 Mar 2020

Abstract
--------
The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally, resulting in more than 300 000 reported cases worldwide as of [21 Mar 2020]. Here we investigate the genetic diversity and genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California using samples from returning travelers, cruise ship passengers, and cases of community transmission with unclear infection sources. Virus genomes were sampled from 29 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection from [3 Feb 2020] through [15 Mar 2020]. Phylogenetic analyses revealed at least 8 different SARS-CoV-2 lineages, suggesting multiple independent introductions of the virus into the state. Virus genomes from passengers on 2 consecutive excursions of the Grand Princess cruise ship clustered with those from an established epidemic in Washington State, including the WA1 genome representing the 1st reported case in the United States on [19 Jan 2020]. We also detected evidence for presumptive transmission of SARS-CoV-2 lineages from one community to another. These findings suggest that cryptic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Northern California to date is characterized by multiple transmission chains that originate via distinct introductions from international and interstate travel, rather than widespread community transmission of a single predominant lineage. Rapid testing and contact tracing, social distancing, and travel restrictions are measures that will help to slow SARS-CoV-2 spread in California and other regions of the USA.

[6] The global impact of COVID-19 and strategies for mitigation and suppression
Date: Thu 26 Mar 2020

Summary
-------
The world faces a severe and acute public health emergency due to the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic. How individual countries respond in the coming weeks will be critical in influencing the trajectory of national epidemics. Here we combine data on age-specific contact patterns and COVID-19 severity to project the health impact of the pandemic in 202 countries. We compare predicted mortality impacts in the absence of interventions or spontaneous social distancing with what might be achieved with policies aimed at mitigating or suppressing transmission. Our estimates of mortality and healthcare demand are based on data from China and high-income countries; differences in underlying health conditions and healthcare system capacity will likely result in different patterns in low income settings.

We estimate that in the absence of interventions, COVID-19 would have resulted in 7.0 billion infections and 40 million deaths globally this year [2020]. Mitigation strategies focusing on shielding the elderly (60% reduction in social contacts) and slowing but not interrupting transmission (40% reduction in social contacts for wider population) could reduce this burden by half, saving 20 million lives, but we predict that even in this scenario, health systems in all countries will be quickly overwhelmed. This effect is likely to be most severe in lower income settings where capacity is lowest: our mitigated scenarios lead to peak demand for critical care beds in a typical low-income setting outstripping supply by a factor of 25, in contrast to a typical high-income setting where this factor is 7. As a result, we anticipate that the true burden in low income settings pursuing mitigation strategies could be substantially higher than reflected in these estimates.

Our analysis therefore suggests that healthcare demand can only be kept within manageable levels through the rapid adoption of public health measures (including testing and isolation of cases and wider social distancing measures) to suppress transmission, similar to those being adopted in many countries at the current time. If a suppression strategy is implemented early (at 0.2 deaths per 100 000 population per week) and sustained, then 38.7 million lives could be saved, whilst if it is initiated when death numbers are higher (1.6 deaths per 100,000
population per week) then 30.7 million lives could be saved. Delays in implementing strategies to suppress transmission will lead to worse outcomes and fewer lives saved.

We do not consider the wider social and economic costs of suppression, which will be high and may be disproportionately so in lower income settings. Moreover, suppression strategies will need to be maintained in some manner until vaccines or effective treatments become available to avoid the risk of later epidemics. Our analysis highlights the challenging decisions faced by all governments in the coming weeks and months, but demonstrates the extent to which rapid, decisive and collective action now could save millions of lives.

[7] Estimating the number of infections and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on COVID-19 in 11 European countries
Date: Mon 30 Mar 2020

Summary
-------
Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside China, Europe is now experiencing large epidemics. In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, wide scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns.

In this report, we use a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model to attempt to infer the impact of these interventions across 11 European countries. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive number -- a measure of transmission -- are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from the deaths observed over time to estimate transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for the time lag between infection and death.

One of the key assumptions of the model is that each intervention has the same effect on the reproduction number across countries and over time. This allows us to leverage a greater amount of data across Europe to estimate these effects. It also means that our results are driven strongly by the data from countries with more advanced epidemics, and earlier interventions, such as Italy and Spain. We find that the slowing growth in daily reported deaths in Italy is consistent with a significant impact of interventions implemented several weeks earlier. In Italy, we estimate that the effective reproduction number, Rt, dropped to close to 1 around the time of lockdown [11 Mar 2020], although with a high level of uncertainty.

Overall, we estimate that countries have managed to reduce their reproduction number. Our estimates have wide credible intervals and contain 1 for countries that have implemented all interventions considered in our analysis. This means that the reproduction number may be above or below this value. With current interventions remaining in place to at least the end of March [2020], we estimate that interventions across all 11 countries will have averted 59 000 deaths up to [31 Mar 2020] [95% credible interval 21 000-120 000]. Many more deaths will be averted through ensuring that interventions remain in place until transmission drops to low levels. We estimate that, across all 11 countries between 7 and 43 million individuals have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 up to [28 Mar 2020], representing between 1.88% and 11.43% of the population. The proportion of the population infected to date - the attack rate - is estimated to be highest in Spain followed by Italy and lowest in Germany and Norway, reflecting the relative stages of the epidemics.

Given the lag of 2-3 weeks between when transmission changes occur and when their impact can be observed in trends in mortality, for most of the countries considered here it remains too early to be certain that recent interventions have been effective. If interventions in countries at earlier stages of their epidemic, such as Germany or the UK, are more or less effective than they were in the countries with advanced epidemics, on which our estimates are largely based, or if interventions have improved or worsened over time, then our estimates of the reproduction number and deaths averted would change accordingly. It is therefore critical that the current interventions remain in place and trends in cases and deaths are closely monitored in the coming days and weeks to provide reassurance that transmission of SARS-Cov-2 is slowing.

[8] More than 50% of clinically recovered Covid-19 patients are still infectious with the SARS-CoV-2 virus
Date: Tue 31 Mar 2020
Source: Thailand Medical News [edited]
https://www.thailandmedical.news/news/breaking-news-study-shows-more-than-50-percent-of-clinically-recovered-covid-19-patients-are-still-infectious-with-the-sars-cov-2-virus


A new study published in the American Thoracic Society's American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine [https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1164/rccm.202003-0524LE] gives a warning that the majority of patients who are clinically recovered were still found to be infectious with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes the deadly Covid-19 disease. The medical researchers found that half of the patients they treated for mild COVID-19 infection still had coronavirus for up to 8 days after symptoms disappeared.

The new research study was published online in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine and titled "Time kinetics of viral clearance and resolution of symptoms in novel coronavirus infection." Dr Lixin Xie and Dr Lokesh Sharma are co-authors of the study of 16 patients with COVID-19, who were treated and released from the Treatment Center of PLA General Hospital in Beijing between [28 Jan and 9 Feb 2020]. Patients studied had a median age of 35.5 years.

The medical researchers collected samples from throat swabs taken from all patients on alternate days and analyzed. Patients were discharged after their recovery and confirmation of negative viral status by at least 2 consecutive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.

Co-lead author Dr Sharma, instructor of medicine, Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care & Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine told Thailand Medical News, "The most significant finding from our study is that half of the patients kept shedding the virus even after resolution of their symptoms. More severe infections may have even longer shedding times."

The main primary symptoms in these patients included fever, cough, pain in the pharynx (pharyngalgia) and difficult or labored breathing (dyspnea). Patients were treated with a range of medications. The average time from infection to onset of symptoms (incubation period) was 5 days among all but one patient. The average duration of symptoms was 8 days, while the length of time patients remained contagious after the end of their symptoms ranged from one to 8 days. A total of 2 patients had diabetes and one had tuberculosis, neither of which affected the timing of the course of COVID-19 infection.

Corresponding author Dr Lixin Xie, professor, College of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing recommended, "If you had mild respiratory symptoms from COVID-19 and were staying at home so as not to infect people, extend your quarantine for another 2 weeks after recovery to ensure that you don't infect other people."

The researchers had a special message for the medical community: "Covid-19 patients can be infectious even after their symptomatic recovery, so treat the asymptomatic/recently recovered patients as carefully as symptomatic patients." The medical researchers emphasized that all of these patients had milder infections and recovered from the disease, and that the study looked at a small number of patients. They noted that it is unclear whether similar results would hold true for more vulnerable patients such as the elderly, those with suppressed immune systems and patients on immunosuppressive therapies.

Dr Xie further added, "Further studies are needed to investigate if the real-time PCR-detected virus is capable of transmission in the later stages of COVID-19 infection."

[9] Time kinetics of viral clearance and resolution of symptoms in Novel Coronavirus infection
Date: Mon 23 Mar 2020

We studied all 16 confirmed COVID-19 patients released from the Treatment Center of PLA General Hospital in Beijing, China, between [28 Jan and 9 Feb 2020]. All patients had throat swabs collected on alternative days and analyzed. Patients were discharged after their recovery and confirmation of "viral negative" status by at least 2o consecutive real-time PCR.

There was only one case of a false negative result in our study where patient No.6 was detected negative followed by a positive detection and then 2 consecutive negative tests were obtained. Travel and possible exposure history were obtained from the patient and noted on their records. Epidemiologically, 10 patients visited Wuhan after the outbreak, and 3 had exposure to a known infected patient, 2 came in contact with people from Wuhan while 1 had no known exposure. The basic clinical characteristics are given in Table1. The median age was 35.5 years (range 3-68 years), with 11/16 males. The major symptoms in these patients were fever (14/16), cough (11/16), pharyngalgia (5/16) and dyspnea (2/16). The day of onset and resolution of these symptoms were noted. Ground glass opacities (GGO) were observed by CT chest in both sides of the lungs in 6 patients, only in the right lung in one patient. Levels of CRP and procalcitonin between the 1st sample obtained at the time of hospitalization and the last sample obtained before discharge were comparable .

All the patients received various medical care to treat the COVID-19; 15 patients were treated with alpha-interferon, along with other antiviral drugs including oseltamivir (1/16), lopinavir/ritonavir (11/16), acyclovir (1/16), moxifloxacin (5/16), methylprednisolone (2/16), gamma globulin (2/16), vancomycin (1/16) and meropenem (1/16) either alone or in combination. Only one patient required respiratory support involving mechanical ventilation.

Time kinetics of symptom onset, duration of symptoms and viral clearance is described in table 1 [see source URL]. The viral detection test was performed upon clinical presentation and repeated every other day until the patient tested negative. The negative test was confirmed again the next day. Upon confirmation of the negative test, the patient was asked to quarantine at home for the next 2 weeks with a follow-up visit to the hospital after one week to confirm the viral negative status. The incubation periods were estimated based on the history of the patient's travel or potential exposure. Our data show an incubation period of 5 days (interquartile range [IQR] 1-6 days) among the patients (except for patient 12 who had no specific exposure). The mean duration of symptoms was estimated to be 8 days (IQR 6.25-11.5). Most importantly, half (8/16) of the patient remained viral positive (a surrogate marker of shedding) even after the resolution of symptoms (median 2.5 days, range 1 to 8 days). Some of our patients had other comorbidities, which included diabetes (2/16) and tuberculosis (1/16), both of which did not affect the time course of the disease. Similarly, the clinical course for the 3 year old male did not significantly differ from the rest of the patients.

Discussion
----------
The current COVID-19 pandemic is the 3rd and the most lethal outbreak of coronavirus in the 21st century (4), where the number of infections and mortality has surpassed both MERS and SARS infections within a short period. Although the infection appears to be milder with the most lethality in the older male population with pre-existing morbidities, it is contagious. The ability to spread may arise from the ability of the virus to transmit from subclinical patients. Cases have been reported where a patient could infect their close contacts even after "apparent recovery" from the infection. This warrants us to investigate the "shedding window" after the clinical recovery of the patient. In this study, we report that half of the patients continued to be viral positive even after the resolution of symptoms up to 8 days. The viral clearance kinetics were similar in another study by Young et al (12 days), where all the patients survived the infection. In contrast virus persisted for 20 days in another study, which had a significant high mortality of over 40%. This information can provide a useful tool for clinicians and policymakers to ensure that recovered patients do not spread the virus. It is important to note that all our patients were milder infections that recovered from the disease. However, it is currently unclear if there is a delayed viral clearance in the more vulnerable population such as those older or those who have immune deficiencies or are on immuno-suppressive therapies.

The current data are derived from mostly young and male subjects, which is consistent with our previous report in Beijing. Similar to the previous study, here, we also demonstrate another child (3 year old male) with COVID-19 indicating the ability of this virus to infect young children as described recently. Our study is limited by the number of patients as there have been limited cases outside the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak that have been successfully treated so far to be released from the hospital. Our study provides initial insights into the viral clearance kinetics and the ability of the virus to persist even after the resolution of the for as long as 8 days, which may pose a significant challenge in controlling the spread of the disease. However, further studies are needed to investigate if the real-time PCR-detected virus is capable of transmission at the later stage of the disease.
