Information on the latest outbreaks of bluetongue in the northern part of
the EU, caused by serotype 8 of the bluetongue virus, can be found at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bluetongue_outbreaks_en.htm>.
To limit the spread of bluetongue, member states put in place restriction
zones around infected areas. From these zones the movement of live
ruminants is restricted. More information on these measures can be found
below and in Commission Decision 2005/393/EC [see at the above URL]. An
overview of the restriction zones, per bluetongue serotype, that have been
put in place by the EU Member States can be found on the [7 Oct 2007] map:

[Subscribers are encouraged to visit the above mentioned map, which
illustrates the alarming spread of BTV-8: its red-coloured restriction
zones now cover the entire surface of the 3 Benelux countries, almost whole
of Germany, nearly half of France, UK's East Anglia and even some parts of
the Czech Republic and Switzerland.
In addition, the map shows areas in southern Europe where other BTV
serotypes (1,2,4,9, and/or 16) are present: Portugal, Spain, France
(Corsica), and Italy. According to the map, unspecified BTV is recorded in
Bulgaria and Cyprus. The size of the map does not allow noting the
situation in Malta. - Mod.AS]

[A total of 4 outbreaks have been added since yesterday [8 Oct 2007]. It
would help if these commendable daily updates included information on the
species affected as well as the morbidity/mortality data. - Mod.AS]
