The South Korean government said [on Sun 19 Nov 2017] that a suspected bird flu case was confirmed to be highly pathogenic and imposed a travel ban to prevent further spread of the animal virus.

The avian influenza, discovered on a poultry farm with 12 000 ducks in Gochang, some 300 kilometers [about 186 mi] south west of Seoul, tested positive as a highly pathogenic strain of H5N6, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.

The ministry said it imposed a nationwide movement ban on poultry, vehicles, and farm workers starting [Mon 20 Nov 2017] to contain further outbreaks.

[The South Korean HPAI H5N6 epizootic started on 16 Nov 2016; between then and the date of the most recent (no. 5) follow-up report, submitted to the OIE on 4 May 2017, a total of 343 outbreaks were reported. Links to the reports submitted and a map presenting all outbreaks are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21637. The disease has spread throughout the western half of South Korea, from its northern border with North Korea, to its southernmost tip.

The current new outbreak might herald a renewed circulation of the virus after its apparent inactivity during the summer months. It is expected to be officially reported to the OIE.

HPAI H5N6, a zoonotic avian influenza strain, has been reported since May 2014 in wild birds and domestic poultry in several countries in East and South East Asia, causing financial losses and cases in humans. A total of 16 human infections with A(H5N6) viruses, as of 25 Sep 2017, have been confirmed (WHO).

It has been suggested that migratory birds were important in the spread and genetic diversification of clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs (see 20170918.5324107). Clade 2.3.4.4 viruses were detected in birds in 40 countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe. The clade 2.3.4.4 viruses from Africa and Europe were primarily of the A(H5N8) subtype; those in Asia were primarily A(H5N6). - Mod.AS
