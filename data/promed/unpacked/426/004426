In eastern Iowa, 3 children have recovered from a rare strain of _E.
coli_, which symptoms include possibly bloody diarrhea.
Kevin Teale, spokesman for the Iowa Department of Public Health,
would not identify the children, all age 5 or under, but said they
were not hospitalized. All were in the same county. The strain of _E.
coli_ is called enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ O26.
Possible sources of infection, including splash pads, wading pools,
and contact with farm kittens, were identified in 2 cases, but no
link was established with the 3rd case.
Teale says 2 of the children had visited both private and municipal
pools. He says lab work found that all 3 strains matched.
Teale said the 3 cases were not considered an outbreak, but because
of the rare strain they warrant attention.

[The posting does not identify the Iowa County where the cases occurred.
Although much attention has been paid to O157:H7 strains of _E. coli_
that (by virtue of toxin production) cause enterohemorrhagic disease
with or without hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), other serotypes of
_E. coli_ have been associated with this illness as well.
_E. coli_ strains can be grouped by the presence of their O (somatic)
and H (flagellar) antigens, hence O157:H7. The toxins produced are
generally one or 2 Shiga toxins (stx1 and stx 2) as well as eae, a
protein intimin that is responsible for attachment of the organism
and mucosal effacing lesions and other virulence factors including
E-hly, espA, etp, and katP.
Other _E. coli_ serogroups that have been associated with VTEC
(verotoxin-producing _E. coli_) disease include motile ones such as
O26:H11 and O104:H21 and nonmotile ones such as O111:NM (or H-). Such
non-O157 isolates can be obtained from sheep and cattle and although
they cause as many as 30 percent of outbreaks of VTEC (1), appear to
be somewhat less (or at least more variably) virulent in a variety of
in vivo and in vitro assays (2-4). In analyzing the genetic and
phenotypic profiles of non-O157 groups, it has been found that they
belong to their own lineages and have unique profiles of virulence
traits different from O157 (5). The serogroups appearing to be most
prominent are O26, O111, O128, and O103 (6), the former serotype
being the implicated strain in this outbreak.
If a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC) plates to identify
VTEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol, the non-O157
strains will be missed. In a 3-year pediatric study from the
University of Washington, USA (7), 1851 stool samples were processed
for sorbitol fermentation as well as toxin production by EIA (enzyme
immunoassay), and 28 strains of O157 were found along with O103 (4
strains), O118 (2 strains), O111 (2 strains), and 3 other strains.
Clinically, the O157 infections had a higher frequency of bloody
stools, fecal leukocytes, and abdominal pain with shorter symptom
duration. Five (18 percent) of O157 infections developed HUS; none of
the non-O157 strains did. Since toxin assay did not identify all O157
strains found on sMAC plates, the investigators did not advocate
performing toxin assay alone. Non-O157 can produce hemolytic-uremic
syndrome, as demonstrated by a cluster of O121 cases associated with
a lake in Connecticut, USA (8).
Since toxin assays are not uniformly performed in many areas, and
most cases do not produce HUS, it is likely that cases due to
non-O157 strains are being missed. How frequent this phenomenon will
become over time is unclear.
