"Murine typhus is a rickettsial disease caused by 2 distinct species of flea -- you have the cat flea and the rat flea," said Angel Guevara, a zoonosis control specialist with the Texas Department of State Health Services [DSHS]. "Primarily this disease is transmitted by the rat flea, by infected fleas that are harbored by rodents, opossums, cats, dogs, and other small mammals." Zoonosis is a field of public health science, which studies diseases transmitted from animals to humans. Guevara spoke recently at a seminar at DSHS's Harlingen [Cameron county] office for a dozen public health professionals who are on the front lines in the state's battle against typhus and other zoonotic diseases.

"A typical flea can fit on the tip of a ballpoint pen," Guevara told his audience. "Once born, they will look for a blood meal within seconds once they jump on your pet. A female flea can produce up to 40 to 50 eggs a day so it can produce at least 2000 eggs during its whole life," he added. "And they lay these eggs within 24 to 48 hours after they have a blood meal -- they need that blood meal to produce offspring."

Much like another emerging illness in South Texas, Chagas disease, murine typhus is transmitted by the flea's unsavory practice of defecating when it bites a host. A person scratches the bite, and drives the rickettsia bacteria in the feces into the wound and into the bloodstream. Once the bacteria make it there, a patient starts to develop a fever, chills, headache, nausea and, after about 5 days after the onset of symptoms, a rash. "Most people will recover without treatment; however, that might require some hospitalization," Guevara said. "We encourage you to get treated for it. If left untreated, severe illness can cause damage to one or more organs, including the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, and the brain."

Obtaining an early diagnosis of murine typhus can be difficult not just for patients but for physicians as well. Since the symptoms often resemble common viral infections, it is only when a patient's condition doesn't improve -- and symptoms can last for weeks -- that many doctors call for a test to determine whether the rickettsial bacteria is present. Another rickettsial disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, also can come up positive in the test, but it is rare in the Valley [Rio Grande Valley]. "Here in Texas, these symptoms can be any variety of illnesses, so we have to rely on physicians," Guevara said. "We let them know that we do have murine typhus here ... and they have to order that test."

In Cameron County, murine typhus cases from 2015 through last year [2017] were 39 [2015], 32 [2016], and 37 [2017], said Esmer Guajardo, health administrator with the Cameron County Department of Health and Human Services. "Generally what we do in terms of alerts to the medical community is based on reporting," she said. "We'll see a spike and we tend to have our providers on alert. Because our numbers have been pretty consistent we just provide the general information about typhus, that it's something that should not be overlooked."

Murine typhus is an endemic disease in the tropics and the sub-tropics, which means it is one of those illnesses that are ever-present, and the sub-tropics is where the Rio Grande Valley falls latitude-wise. Hidalgo, Nueces and Cameron counties generally lead the way in murine typhus cases reported in Texas. Part of the answer is found in the region's mild weather, which means fleas, eggs, and larvae are not subject to winter-kill like in most of the rest of the nation. It also means many residents leave pets outside year-round, which then become reservoirs for fleas that can carry disease.

"In some areas, people keep their dogs indoors but a lot of people tend to keep their dogs outside around-the-clock," Guajardo said, "and that's obviously an avenue for having some exposure to more fleas within the household."

Another reason, at least in Hidalgo county, is population growth. "We're a weird county because we're the 7th-most populous county in Texas, and the only counties bigger than us are very urbanized -- Bexar County, Tarrant County, Collin County up near Plano and Houston and Dallas," said Eddie Olivarez, chief administrative officer for Hidalgo County Health and Human Services. "We still have a lot of rural-ness to our area, especially in the unincorporated areas of our county, so what ends up happening is you still have lot of areas where, for lack of a better term, it's prime for wildlife, prime for some of these other critters where fleas and ticks are an issue."

Hidalgo county has traditionally led the state in the number of confirmed murine typhus cases annually, recording 97 cases in 2015, 85 in 2016, and 99 cases last year [2017]. Olivarez pinpoints the opossum and feral cats as prime suspects in the county's high typhus numbers. "We're still up there among the higher problematic counties, but a lot of it has to do with population," he added. "Our population density is so tight, as we have more and more people moving out into the country and into more rural areas, and we have a lot more domesticated animals getting in with the opossum population ... those are the situations that are causing the problem for us."

State health officials issued a statewide alert aimed at medical professionals to be on the lookout for murine typhus on [30 Nov 2017].

While Cameron and Hidalgo counties' numbers are relatively high but stable, other areas of the state are seeing spikes in murine typhus cases. State officials are saying only the numbers are "significantly" higher over the first three months of this year compared to 2017.

They are urging local physicians to be aware of the possibility patients may be showing symptoms not of a viral disease, but a bacterial one. "Typhus actually gets a little bit more complicated because not only is it confusing for the flu, but it's also confusing for Zika and it's also confusing for dengue," said Hidalgo county's Olivarez. "We do have Rocky Mountain spotted fever on occasion, but most of the time it's imported, a person who becomes ill went on a vacation to another area. Actually we've seen a few cases of Lyme disease, which is very rare for us, but we've seen some of the more localized cases especially up in the Willacy county area in Port Mansfield just because of the high deer population," he added.

Pet treatment: use only products labeled for use on pets. Check labels because insecticides for dogs may be dangerous for cats. Treat animals thoroughly around the ears, between legs and around tail. Wear gloves when applying dusts, spot-on treatments of sprays. Use insect growth regulators, flea collars, spot-on or spray treatments before fleas become a problem.

Before treating, clean house thoroughly and vacuum under, on, and around furniture where pets sit or sleep to remove flea eggs and larvae. Wash and air-dry pet bedding. Apply a spray insecticide or dust to pet bedding and other areas where pets sleep or play. Use only products designated for indoor use on label.

Apply a spray flea insecticide to garages, under porches and decks, and outside areas where pets sleep or play. Prevent pets from getting under the house so the area doesn't become infested. Get rid of rats, mice, and other animals that can carry fleas by cleaning up trash piles or debris in yard.

Signs and symptoms
------------------
Fever and chills, body aches and muscle pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, cough, rash (typically occurs around day 5).

Symptoms become apparent 2 weeks after a bite from an infected flea. Most people will recover without treatment, but some cases may be severe. When left untreated, severe illness can cause damage to one or more organs including the liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain.

Flea-borne or murine typhus is a rickettsial disease caused by the bacteria, _Rickettsia typhi_ (rat flea) or possibly _R. felis_ (cat flea) that can be transmitted by infected fleas carried by rats, opossums, cats, dogs, and other small mammals. The disease is similar to louse-borne typhus (_R. prowazekii_), but is generally milder. Louse-borne typhus has been responsible for deadly epidemics for centuries.

Cases are reported year-round, but the majority of typhus cases in Texas occur between May and July, with another peak in December and January.

Typhus by the numbers: 2800 confirmed flea-borne typhus cases reported in Texas, 2000 through 2016; 157 -- median number of cases per year; 364 -- average maximum number of cases per year; and 400-plus cases reported in state in 2017. 9 Texas counties reported murine typhus in 2003; 36 Texas counties reporting murine typhus in 2016.

Typhus by county 2008-2016: Hidalgo -- 673 cases; Nueces -- 447 cases; Cameron -- 251 cases; Bexar -- 151 cases; Starr -- 38 cases; and Willacy -- 18 cases (Texas Department of State Health Services).

[The Rio Grande Valley is an area located in the southernmost tip of the USA state of Texas. It lies along the northern bank of the Rio Grande River, which separates Mexico from the United States; the four-county region consists of Hidalgo, Cameron, Willacy, and Starr counties (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rio_Grande_Valley). It is one of the fastest growing regions in the United States, with its population having jumped from about 325 000 people in 1969 to more than 1.3 million people by 2014. Brownsville (175 023 residents) and Harlingen (64 849 residents), both in Cameron County, are some of the biggest metro areas in the region in 2014. Nueces is a county in the U.S. state of Texas, with a population of 340 223; the county seat is the city of Corpus Christ (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueces_County,_Texas) and Bexar is a county of the US state of Texas, with a population was about 1.96 million residents in 2017; its county seat is the city of San Antonio (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bexar_County,_Texas). A county map of Texas can be seen at: https://geology.com/county-map/texas-county-map.gif.

The state of Texas mandates reporting of rickettsial diseases to the Texas Department of State Health Services. A previous ProMED-mail post (ProMED-mail post Murine typhus - USA: (TX) increase cases, geographic expansion, 2003-2013 20170317.4908356) reported that typhus group rickettsiosis cases, mostly murine typhus, which is caused by _Rickettsia typhi_, expanded geographically from 9 counties in south Texas in 2003 to 41 counties in 2013 (see Figure 2 at https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/23/4/16-0958-f2).

Using the number of cases for each Texas county in the news report above between 2008-2016, Nueces county, with a population of 340 223 in 2010, has the highest cumulative incidence (131.4 cases/100 000 population). Hidalgo county, with a population of 774 769 in 2010, has the next highest cumulative incidence of 86.9 cases/100 000. Cameron county, with a population of 406 220 in 2010, has an incidence of 61.8 cases/100 000; and Bexar county with a population of about 1.7 million in 2010, has 8.9 cases/100 000. - Mod.ML
