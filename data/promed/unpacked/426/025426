The Anambra State Ministry of Health has deployed a rapid response team to assess reported cases of a cholera outbreak in the state. Up to 11 persons had been hospitalized in Inoma community in Anambra West Local Government Area of the state following the outbreak.

The State Commissioner of Health, Dr Joseph Akabuike, in a statement issued in Awka, the state capital, by the state ministry of information said, "The team was dispatched by the Commissioner for Health, Dr Joe Akabuike." "The team is led by the State Disease Surveillance Officer Adaora Ejikeme, accompanied by the State UNICEF Consultant, Didien Gbofemi".

"The team was tasked to stem the spread as well as recommend measures at containing any replication. Up to 11 patients, 5 boys and 6 girls within the age bracket of one to 10-years-old, had since been admitted into a health facility in the area. The patients, our correspondent gathered, showed symptoms of excessive stooling, vomiting, acute dehydration and malnutrition."

The statement also stated "A preliminary report released by the Rapid Response Team, showed that the main source of drinking water for the community was a contaminated stream".

At least 7 people have died of cholera since the recent outbreak, a report says. The report presented to the county assembly yesterday, [Tue 5 Dec 2017], revealed 116 suspected cases were treated and 34 confirmed to have cholera.

The report contradicts earlier reports by Health Executive Hazel Koitaba, who placed the cholera deaths at 2. The report was presented by Kibwana Baya, the chairman of the Committee on Health. He is also the Member of the County Assembly for Miritini Ward. The session was chaired by Deputy Speaker and Port Reitz MCA Fadhil Makarani. This followed a question by nominated member Moses Oindo on the status of cholera in the county. Ms Koitaba had reported that a mother and her child died and 25 people were admitted in hospital following the cholera outbreak.

The report revealed the Department of Health had banned hawking of food and bottled water within the town and residential estates to contain cholera. "To rid the county of unscrupulous water bottlers, all companies in the sector are directed to immediately present themselves and deposit their Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs) certification with the Department of Health, failure to which punitive action will be taken against them," stated the report.

[5] Cholera - Kenya (Embu County)
Date: Tue 5 Dec 2017

http://www.nation.co.ke/counties/embu/Three-more-people-in-Embu-admitted-over-cholera/3370188-4215908-78yttvz/index.html


Health officials in Embu County are on high alert after 3 new cholera cases were reported on [Mon 4 Dec 2017] in 3 villages in Mbeere South.

The new cases brings the number of cholera infections in the county to 53 in the past one and a half months. Three people have died from the disease.

County Director of Health Stephen Kaniaru said the 3 patients come from Rwika, Kabuguri and Nganduri villages, which mainly rely on water from River Thiba. They could have contracted the disease after eating in hotels with low hygienic standards, he added. The official said the 3 - a 70-year-old grandmother, a 14-year-old girl, and a 36-year-old man - are receiving medical attention at cholera treatment centres in Kiritiri, Ganduri and Embu Level 5 Hospital.

Dr Kaniaru said they have closed 8 eateries and 4 butcheries in Rwika, and 6 eateries and 5 butcheries in Nganduri, which did not meet sanitation standards. He said strict rules on food hawking, outside catering and eating in social places is still on so as to reduce the infections.

"The 3 admitted to eating food from hotels whose hygiene standards are questionable. This has made us change tack, since we emphasised more on improving personal hygiene in the past few weeks," he said.

Dr Kaniaru said the county water sources had been contaminated, thus contributing to the increased number of cases of cholera. He said results from tests done by the government chemist and water management authority established that water sources had faecal matter. "We are now sensitizing people on the need to drink safe water as well as eat from clean eateries. We are still on high alert and doing a lot to stem out the disease," he said.

[6] Diarrhea - Kenya (Isiolo County)
Date: Tue 5 Dec 2017

About 500 people living along Ewaso Ng'iro River settlements in Isiolo County have been affected by a diarrheal disease outbreak in the last 2 months. County Public Health officer Guracha Sarite said the outbreak has affected vulnerable children under 5 years and women in several areas of Merti, Garbatulla and Oldonyiro since September 2017. Up to 18 samples of human stool and water from 10 sources have been collected and taken to Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) for bacteriological analysis to rule out cholera.

Records from health facilities in Garbatulla sub-county indicate that November 2017 had the highest number of patients with diarrhea with 186 cases while 41 cases were reported between [Fri 1-Sun 3 Dec 2017]. A team of public health officers, disease surveillance coordinator and laboratory technicians who visited the affected areas found out that Merti had 300 cases while Garbatulla and Oldonyiro recorded 150 and 50 cases respectively.

Mr Sarite said community water storage tanks have not been cleaned for more than 2 years in all the centers the team visited leading to water contamination. Water sources are also suspected to have been contaminated by fecal matter due to flooding in areas where open defecation is practiced by the communities.

Affected areas in Merti sub-county include Dadachabasa, Malkagala, Korbesa, Mataabra, Merti town, Awarsitu, Bulesa, Biliqo and Biliqo Marara while in Garba Tulla; Gafarsa, Sericho, Badana, Iresaboru, Kombola and Malkadaka have been hit by the outbreak.

[The etiology (or etiologies) of the diarrhea is not stated and may well be multifactorial including cholera, other bacterial illnesses and viral or protozoan causes. Isiolo County is a county in the former Eastern Province in central Kenya and can be found on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isiolo_County.

The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
