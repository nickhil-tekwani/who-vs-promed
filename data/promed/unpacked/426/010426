Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak location: Al Rai Live Bird Market, Al Rai, Farwaniyah, Al Farwaniyah
Date of start of the outbreak: 24 Jan 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: livestock market
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 2000 / 3 / 3 / 1997 / 0
Affected population: Captive pet birds from different species kept in a pet shop at Al Rai live bird market

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]:
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 0.15 / 0.15 / 100 / 100
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N8 was detected by the National Veterinary Laboratory of Kuwait. All in-contact birds in the affected live birds market were humanely killed and disposed of with appropriate disinfection procedures. The market was closed and movement restriction implemented, including export trade ban of live birds. There are no commercial poultry farms in a 10-km [6-mi] radius around the affected establishment. Intensive active surveillance is in place for poultry farms, backyards and other bird markets area including migratory birds.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, screening, quarantine, official destruction of animal products, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping out, control of wildlife reservoirs, disinfection, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Central Veterinary and Research Laboratory (national laboratory) / birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/ 31 Jan 2019 / positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[Since October 2018, HPAI H5N8 has been reported from South Africa, Nigeria, Bulgaria and Iran.

According to OIE's most recent situation report on HPAI (updated 31 Aug 2018), the incidence of H5N8 strains has decreased globally and only a few countries in Africa and the Middle East continue reporting outbreaks in poultry and/or wild birds. Some of these countries are located on the migratory routes for wild birds suggesting the likely spread of the virus along the route.

Since HPAI H5N8 subtypes cause high mortality in domestic poultry, veterinary services in at-risk countries have recommended increased prevention efforts through bio-security to minimize contact between wild birds and poultry and enhanced surveillance and preparedness. They are also strengthening their wild bird surveillance activities in areas where viruses have been detected and in other areas where there are significant populations of migratory waterfowl.

The majority of wild bird migration across Europe, Africa, and Asia subsides after the winter season. While wintering locations of these migratory birds are often stable, additional movement within a region may be affected by local weather conditions, food resources, access to open water, etc.

For FAO's most recent H5N8 HPAI global situation update, dated 30 Jan 2019, see http://tinyurl.com/yacnfemy.

Although no transmission of this virus to humans has been identified, according to WHO's assessment the risk is not negligible and personal protection is recommended. - Mods.CRD/AS
