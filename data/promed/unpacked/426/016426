A La Crosse woman has died of a disease that is considered rare in the Midwest, health officials said. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services and the La Crosse County Health Department said [Tue 10 Jul 2018], that the death is the 1st documented from Rocky Mountain spotted fever in Wisconsin.

Jo Foellimi, a La Crosse County public health nurse, says a tick bit the woman while she was camping in western Wisconsin in early May [2018]. The woman was diagnosed with RMSF in mid-June and died days later. Foellimi says the woman was in her late 50s but declined to identify her.

RMSF most commonly occurs in the central and southeastern regions of the USA, according to a news release. Most tickborne diseases transmitted in Wisconsin are spread by the blacklegged tick. RMSF, however, is spread by the bite of the American dog (or wood) tick. Early symptoms of RMSF can be mild and typically include fever, headache, nausea, vomiting, rash and stomach pain, DHS said. If left untreated, an RMSF infection can rapidly develop into a serious illness.

DHS encouraged Wisconsin residents to take the following steps to protect themselves and their families from tick bites while enjoying the outdoors:
- Use an insect repellent with at least 20-percent DEET or another EPA-registered repellent according to the label instructions.
- Use 0.5-percent permethrin products on clothing, socks and shoes according to label instructions.
- Stay on trails and avoid walking through tall grasses and brush.
- Wear long sleeves and pants, and tuck pants into socks and shirts into pants to avoid ticks crawling under clothing.
- Check your entire body for ticks after being outdoors.
- Take a shower as soon as possible after coming in from outdoors.
- Place clothes in the dryer on high heat for 10 minutes to kill any ticks on clothing.
- Use a veterinarian-prescribed tick prevention treatment on pets.

DHS said that of the illnesses spread by ticks in Wisconsin, Lyme disease is the most common, but ticks can also spread anaplasmosis, ehrlichiosis and, more rarely, RMSF and Powassan virus.

Many people who contract a tickborne disease do not recall a tick bite, so it is also important to be aware of the common symptoms of tickborne disease, such as fever, rash, headache, body aches and fatigue. Most diseases spread by ticks in Wisconsin can be effectively treated with antimicrobials, making early diagnosis critical, health officials said. If symptoms develop after a tick bite or after possible tick exposure, see a health care provider.

[When a female _Dermacentor_ tick harboring the organism attaches to a passing human, she usually starts low on the body after transferring from grassy vegetation or even directly or indirectly from a dog. After crawling around on clothes seeking an appropriate cutaneous site (wearing white clothes makes a wandering tick easier to spot), she attaches and begins to feed. If not already partially fed, after attaching, it generally takes 24 hours to activate and transmit the rickettsial organism. For this reason, daily or twice-daily tick checks with removal will minimize disease transmission. Ticks that attach in hairy areas such as the scalp or beard may be more difficult to find.

The timing in this report is strange as the incubation period of the disease is about a week after the tick exposure, long after the tick has detached but not a month. It is unclear when the illness actually began and the actual exposure may not have been the one reported. The presenting illness is generally nonspecific, fever, muscle pains, headache (but the headache is usually described as quite severe). The rash begins on day 3 of the illness, initially maculopapular at the wrists and ankles before becoming petechial and purpuric, involving the palms and soles as well as spreading proximally to the trunk. Purpura usually is not seen before the 6th day of illness. The mortality is indeed quite low if treatment (usually a tetracycline) is begun during the 1st 2 days of the rash or before.

Empiric treatment for this infection should always be begun in people with compatible symptoms inhabiting endemic areas during the spring and summer, even if no tick bite is known.

The early rash of this disease can be seen at http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d2/Rocky_Mountain_spotted_fever_PHIL_1962_lores.jpg.

Delayed diagnosis contributes to morbidity and mortality of RMSF as it may have here. A tetracycline represent the best drug for treatment, even in children, Practicing infectious diseases in western Wisconsin as I do, we see many cases of tickborne disease this time of year and although RMSF is uncommon, tetracycline is also used for borreliosis, anaplasmosis and ehrlichiosis and is often begun empirically before diagnostics are available.

According to the state of Wisconsin (https://www.dhs.wisconsin.gov/tickborne/rmsf.htm) between 2013 and 2017, only 69 cases were reported in the state. The majority of these reported cases were acquired outside of Wisconsin. - Mod.LL
