Epidemiological comments:
- The owner bought these pigs for companionship purpose. The 1st pig arrived in February 2021 and 2 other pigs arrived in August 2021. The pigs started showing clinical signs such as fever, stupor, and labored breathing on 25 Nov 2021 and died on 1, 5, and 7 Dec 2021, respectively. The owner sent the pig corpse to Kasetsart University to find out the cause of sudden death on 1 Dec 2021. Department of Livestock Development (DLD) had confirmed this case by Western Regional Veterinary Research and Development Center and the result was confirmed on 10 Jan 2022. This case is under investigation. DLD has been conducting active and passive surveillance since a neighboring country reported an outbreak of African swine fever.

- For the pork products issue that had been exported to Chinese Taipei, DLD investigated this case and found that the pig used for producing this product originated from Nakhon Pathom province. DLD had conducted active surveillance in Nakhon Pathom province (109 samples) and found 1 sample positive.

Control measures applied in domestic: ante and post-mortem inspections, surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone, surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone, traceability, zoning, quarantine, movement control inside the country, disinfection.

[This official report complements the information published in ProMED postings 20220112.8700803 and 20220111.8700785. Although the details about the positive sample detected in Nakhon Pathom are few, it is clear that African swine fever has been now officially identified in that area.

Unfortunately, ASF continues to spread in Asia. Since the disease was first officially reported by China in August 2018, Mongolia, Viet Nam, Cambodia, North Korea, Laos, Myanmar, The Philippines, South Korea, East Timor, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, India, including Arunachal Pradesh, Malaysia and Bhutan have been affected.
