The sole male rhino at Tripura's Sepahijala Zoo died on Wednesday night [10 Dec 2014]. Zoo director Krishna Gopal Roy said the 25-year-old rhino died of anthrax. Roy said zoo keepers saw the rhino, which was bleeding, collapse on Wednesday evening. Medical help was sought but the rhino succumbed [died] on Wednesday night. A detailed investigation by a joint team of veterinary and wildlife officials on Thursday afternoon [11 Dec 2014] confirmed anthrax to be the cause of death, Roy said. There will not be any autopsy [sic] on the rhino as per anthrax protocol.

The animal had been brought to Tripura from Assam Zoo in 1994.

Pradip will be buried on Friday [12 Dec 2014].

The great Indian rhinoceros, _Rhinoceros unicornis_, is found in India, Bhutan, and Nepal in wildlife sanctuaries in the sub-Himalayan belt -- in the Brahmaputra valley in Assam state (where the largest population of rhinos worldwide exists in Kaziranga National Park), in the Chitwan valley in Nepal, and in lowland Bhutan. It is found in marshy lowlands. Tall grass, thick forests, and swamps are rhino territory. The rhino spends a significant amount of time during the day wallowing in mud or marshy pools. It feeds on grass, leaves, and twigs. It usually feeds in the morning and evening and spends the hot daytime cooling off in a mud wallow. The prehensile upper lip of the rhino helps it in feeding. The Indian rhinoceros is an endangered species. The pressure of human populations on the last remaining habitats of the rhinoceros, poaching for the sake of its horn, and tiger predation of its calves are threats to its continued survival in the wild.

Reports of anthrax in rhinos are infrequent if not rare. ProMED-mail has 2, see below, including one reported retrospectively in the Gorumara Forest area after a gaur was found to have died of the disease.

There are only 3 papers in the literature covering this disease in rhinos, and then only incidentally:

1. ME Hugh-Jones, V de Vos. Anthrax and wildlife. OIE Scientific & Technical Review 2002; 21(2): 359-83.
2. V de Vos. The epidemiology of a major anthrax outbreak in the Kruger National Park. In: Abstracts of the International Workshop on anthrax, 19-21 Sep 1995, Winchester, United Kingdom, 25-26.
3. PM Lindeque, PCB Turnbull. Ecology and epidemiology of anthrax in the Etosha National Park, Namibia, Onderstepoort Journal of Veterinary Research 1994; 61: 71-83.

As with the 2008 case, as this animal was confined to a zoological garden and not grazing freely, I think we can presume that he was fed contaminated feed of some sort. If so, there have been other cases inside and outside the Tripura Sepahijala Zoo. - Mod.MHJ
