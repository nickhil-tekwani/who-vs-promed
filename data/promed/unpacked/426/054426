White fly alarm in El Ejido
---------------------------
Andalusia's Alert and Phytosanitary Information Network (RAIF) has reported an alert corresponding to tomatoes in the production areas of Almeria and Granada [provinces] Tropical Coast.

The RAIF detected the presence of white flies (_Bemisia tabaci_) in high levels (of more than 10 percent) in the municipality of El Ejido [Almeria province, Andalusia community] on plants still in the stage between the planting and the flowering. In the rest of Almeria and Granada's coast, the white fly levels are still average, of between 2 and 10 percent.

A growth in the population of white flies entails a higher risk of virus propagation, including the New Delhi [virus], which mostly affects courgettes [zucchini] and melons [see ProMED-mail post 20131223.2131729].

[_Tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus_ (ToLCNDV) has been reported to cause severe yield losses on tomato and watermelon crops in the Indian subcontinent. It belongs to the tomato leaf curl and yellow leaf curl clades of genus _Begomovirus_. Known species in these clades cause similar diseases on solanaceous and other crops and can lead to considerable yield losses. Begomoviruses are transmitted by different whitefly vectors (such as _Bemisia tabaci_ biotypes) and many can also be transmitted by mechanical means and grafting, but they are not seed transmitted.

Whiteflies in themselves are serious pests of many vegetable crops. If virus sources are available locally, high vector numbers are often reflected in high levels of the viral diseases they transmit. _Begomovirus_ control is particularly difficult in open field crops due to the widespread presence and wide host range of whiteflies. Disease management may include pathogen exclusion, vector control, and elimination of possible pathogen and/or vector reservoir plants. In some cases, crop cultivars with increased virus resistance are available.

ToLCNDV was reported from Spain for the 1st time on zucchini crops in 2013 (ProMED-mail post 20131223.2131729), but the source of the incursion is apparently still unknown. It has a wider host range than the related _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ which had previously been present in Spain (see for example, ProMED-mail post 20100923.3444). National producers hope that the introduced strain is specific to cucurbits and will not spread to crops in other families as well.
