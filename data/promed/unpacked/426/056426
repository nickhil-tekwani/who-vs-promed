The investigation into the outbreak of bovine tuberculosis in Alberta and Saskatchewan nearly 2 years ago is now closed. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency made the announcement on [Mon 30 Apr 2018] after receiving the final laboratory culture results from the investigation. All of the results came back negative.

The outbreak began on a farm near Jenner in 2016. A total of 6 animals, all from the same ranch in Jenner, were found to have the disease. The agency tested herds in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba during the outbreak. Approximately 11 500 animals were destroyed, and 39 million USD in compensation were paid to producers.

According to the CFIA, the producers whose herds were depopulated and have completed the cleaning and disinfection of their premises have restocked their herds.

All farms have been removed from quarantine.

The CFIA says the final report into the outbreak will be released in June [2018].

[While new to Canada, the strain of tuberculosis bacteria which infected the Alberta cow at the centre of the bovine TB probe had been seen before in Mexico. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency reported the strain of _Mycobacterium bovis_ found in a southeastern Alberta cow was "closely related" to a strain originating from cattle in central Mexico in 1997. The _M. bovis_ pathogen from the infected cow is not the same as any strains previously detected in Canadian domestic animals, wildlife or people to date.

We look forward to reading CFIA's full report when it is released this coming June [2018], which hopefully will explain how this all may have come about. An expensive lesson. - Mod.MHJ
