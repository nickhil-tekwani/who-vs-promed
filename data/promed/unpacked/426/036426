From: Patrick L. McDonough <plm2@cornell.edu>

Tularemia is endemic in parts of New England. Have a look at our paper on
the history of the problem and the syndrome that we have seen in cats from
Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard areas.
Is there any chance that this individual visited those areas recently?

[Being an avid reader of the New York Times with its frequent articles on
the beauty of that city's many parks, I suspect that cats don't need to go
as far as Massachusetts to acquire this infection. However, a NYT
journalist's appreciation of nature in the raw may be somewhat different
from the rest of us living in more rural areas. Surely we have informed
members in NYC who can comment? - Mod.MHJ
