The company at the heart of a nationwide outbreak of
salmonella-related illness linked to salami says it has detected the
bacterium in sealed containers of red pepper from 2 suppliers, raising
concerns that other food makers may have used tainted spices.

The results reported by Daniele Inc. need to be confirmed by a
government laboratory, but federal investigators are examining whether
other food manufacturers supplied by the Wholesome Spice Co. of New
York and Mincing Overseas Spice Co. of New Jersey bought tainted spices.

At least 230 people in 44 states and the District [of
Columbia/Washington DC] have fallen ill from the outbreak, and about
[a quarter] have been hospitalized.

Wholesome Spice said none of the tests by government officials has
detected salmonella in its products. Mincing Overseas did not return
calls seeking comment.

The sausage company at the center of a widespread _Salmonella_
outbreak has recalled another 115 000 pounds of products, this time
citing red pepper instead of black pepper as the possible source of
contamination. Daniele Inc., based in Pascoag, RI, said it is
recalling 115 000 pounds [52 tonnes] of "Hot Salame Panino" product, a
type of salami wrapped in mozzarella cheese and sprinkled with red
pepper, produced between 5 Nov 2009 and 15 Feb 2010.

"The red pepper used on the product came from the same supplier that
provided Daniele with black pepper that also tested positive for the
_Salmonella_," the company said in a statement today [17 Feb 2010].

On the basis of preliminary testing, "the company believes crushed red
pepper may be a possible source of contamination," the US Department
of Agriculture's (USDA's) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS)
said yesterday [16 Feb 2010]. The agency said further testing is under
way to determine if the product contained the _S._ Montevideo strain
associated with the outbreak.

Daniele said the latest recall includes 6 different products sold
under various names, all labeled with "EST. 459" inside the USDA mark
of inspection. They have sell-by dates ranging from 3 Feb 2010 through
26 May 2010 and were distributed to retail stores nationwide.

Daniele did not name the supplier of the red pepper now under
suspicion, but Rhode Island health officials previously said that
black pepper that tested positive came from 2 distributors, Wholesome
Spice and Mincing Overseas Spice Co.

[This is the 1st time that a previously unopened pepper container,
this one with crushed red pepper, revealed the outbreak strain (the
"smoking gun"). More information is awaited about the source or
sources of the outbreak isolates. - Mod.LL]
