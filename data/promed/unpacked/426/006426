A man from Karachi Gardens is the 8th victim of the lethal amoeba, _Naegleria fowleri_ in Pakistan this year [2014], according to a Dawn.com report today [23 Aug 2014]. The 34-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital in a precarious condition on Wednesday [20 Aug 2014] where he died on Thursday [21 Aug 2014].

"He was the 8th victim of _Naegleria_ this year [2014] in Sindh. Seven deaths have been reported from Karachi and another from Hyderabad," said Dr Zafar Ijaz, the executive district officer-health, Karachi. "We have taken samples of water from his house and shop for examination," he added.

Karachi was the epicenter of a _Naegleria fowleri_ outbreak that killed 10 people in the summer of 2012.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), _Naegleria fowleri_ is a free-living amoeba that can cause a rare and devastating infection of the brain called primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM).

People get infected when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose. This typically occurs when people go swimming or diving in warm freshwater places, like lakes and rivers. The _Naegleria fowleri_ ameba then travels up the nose to the brain where it destroys the brain tissue.

In Pakistan, the amoeba has been reported contracted by performing ablution. The practice of ablution is included in Yogic, Ayurvedic, and Islamic traditions. Within the Islamic faith, ritual nasal rinsing is included in a cleansing process called wudu, or ablution. It is usually performed several times a day in preparation for prayer, according to the CDC. The deadly parasite has also been contracted via the use of neti pots.

You cannot be infected with _Naegleria fowleri_ by drinking contaminated water, the CDC notes.

[There is no information on how the diagnosis was made, especially whether it was based on microscopy alone or whether molecular methods were used. Without this information, it is uncertain whether the diagnosis was correct or not, and ProMED will be happy to post additional information on how the diagnosis was made.

As stated in the text, free living amoeba cannot be transmitted by drinking water. If the patients performed the religious rites as described, it would explain how the patient was infected. - Mod.EP
