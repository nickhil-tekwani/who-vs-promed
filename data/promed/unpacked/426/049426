More tainted milk products found in China
-----------------------------------------
Melamine-laced milk products have been found [again] on sale in China,
state media said on Monday [25 Jan 2010], more than a year after the
chemical was blamed for 6 deaths in a huge scandal over contaminated
dairy goods.

Authorities in the southwestern province of Guizhou found that
products made by 3 food companies contained illegally high levels of
the toxic substance, the China Daily said.

It quoted a former dairy industry official as saying it was likely
more tainted goods remained in supermarkets despite a major recall
after the 2008 scandal, which highlighted China's persistent product
safety problems.

The suspect products in Guizhou have been pulled from stores, the
China Daily said, adding that the firms involved blamed milk powder
bought from suppliers.

The report illustrated the apparent continued threat from tainted
dairy goods long after the 2008 scandal when it was revealed that the
industrial chemical -- which can, in large quantities, cause kidney
failure and death -- was being abused by food producers.

At that time, melamine was found to have been added to milk to give
the appearance of a higher protein content and was blamed for killing
6 infants and making nearly 300 000 others sick, according to official
figures.

The scare led to foodstuffs containing dairy products being taken off
shelves around the world. A total of 21 people were reportedly
convicted of wrongdoing, with 2 executed and others sentenced to jail
terms. But other cases have since surfaced.

Earlier this month [January 2010], the state press revealed that
Shanghai Panda Dairy had been shut down again over melamine-tainted
milk products [see ProMED ref. below]. The company had been
blacklisted and closed over the 2008 scandal but was allowed to
reopen. 3 Chinese executives with the company could face trial as
early as next month [February 2010] on charges of making and selling
hazardous foods, a spokesman in the Shanghai prosecutors' office has
said.

The China Daily said the products found in Guizhou were made in March
and April of 2009, months after the government declared an all-clear.

The 3 companies involved, in separate locations across north and east
China, were Zibo Lusaier Dairy Company, Tieling Wuzhou Food Company,
and the Laoting Kaida Refrigeration Plant, it said.

It said the goods included "popsicles" [see image in link at end]
produced by 2 of the companies but gave no other specifics.

Staff at the Guizhou provincial health department denied the report
when contacted by AFP. Ling Hu, a spokeswoman with the Guizhou
provincial government, said officials there were looking into the
allegations but declined further comment. AFP could not immediately
reach officials at the 3 companies.

The China Daily quoted Wang Dingmian, former chairman of the Guangdong
Provincial Dairy Association in southern China, as suggesting
"leftover" tainted dairy goods were likely still circulating despite
the earlier recall.

"The problems were not totally solved. From this point, it's
inevitable to see new problems popping out," he said.

[Melamine is an organic base chemical most commonly found in the form
of white crystals rich in nitrogen. It is widely used in plastics,
adhesives, countertops, dishware, and whiteboards. Symptoms and signs
of melamine poisoning are irritability, blood in urine, little or no
urine, signs of kidney infection, and high blood pressure. Melamine
causes kidney stones and other urinary tract problems in lab animals.
It also causes kidney failure and death (see
<http://www.who.int/csr/media/faq/QAmelamine/en/index.html>).

In 2007, melamine was found in wheat gluten and rice protein
concentrate exported from China and used in the manufacture of pet
food in the United States. This caused the death of a large number of
dogs and cats due to kidney failure (see prior ProMED-mail post Pet
food fatalities, pets - USA, Canada, Mexico (03): melamine
20070330.1099).

According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
regulations the presence of melamine is considered adulteration.
Adulterated foods are not acceptable for marketing or consumption. In
China, where adulteration has occurred, melamine has also been added
to increase the nitrogen content of the milk (its apparent protein
content) after water was added to raw milk to increase its volume.

According to the report from the Ministry of Health of China dated 22
Sep 2008, there had been more than 53 000 cases identified, of which
13 000 were hospitalized, and 104 infants were in serious condition.

In January 2009, a court in China sentenced 2 men to death for their
role in making and selling milk tainted with melamine. At least 6
children died and nearly 300 000 fell ill after drinking the toxic
dairy products in 2008 (see prior PRO/MBDS post Infant kidney stones -
China (06): WHO, timeline 20080922.2990).

From the newswire above, melamine-laced milk products produced in
March and April of 2009 have been found for sale in shops in Guizhou
and 3 companies there are allegedly involved in making and selling
these hazardous foods. - Mod.SCM]

[In general the melamine has been added to powdered milk products,
including such things as powdered infant formula to be mixed at the
home.

The solubility of melamine in water is 3.1 grams of melamine per liter
of water at 20 deg C [68 deg F], so it is possible to add it to liquid
products.

While melamine can be added to liquid milk products, melamine is not
naturally found in milk and does not pass through a
cow/sheep/goat/horse into the liquid milk. - Mod.TG]
