While around the world a vast majority of AIDS victims are men, Africa has long been the glaring exception: nearly 60 percent are women. And while there are many theories, no one has been able to prove one. In a modest public health clinic behind a gas station in Otimati in South Africa's rural KwaZulu/Natal Province, a team of Norwegian infectious disease specialists think they may have found a new explanation. It is far too soon to say whether they are right. But even skeptics say the explanation is biologically plausible. And if it is proved correct, a low-cost solution has the potential to prevent thousands of infections every year.

The Norwegian team believes that African women are more vulnerable to HIV because of a chronic, undiagnosed parasitic disease: genital schistosomiasis, often nicknamed "schisto." The disease, also known as bilharzia and snail fever, is caused by parasitic worms picked up in infested river water. It can cause fragile sores in the far reaches of the vaginal canal that may serve as entry points for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Dr Eyrun F Kjetland, who leads the Otimati team, says that it is more common than syphilis or herpes, which can also open the way for HIV.

Also, the foreign bodies in the sores -- the worms and eggs -- attract CD4 cells, the immune system's sentinels, and those are the very cells that HIV attacks. The worms can be killed by a drug that can cost as little as 8 cents a pill. Dr Kjetland's team is trying to determine whether that will heal the sores in young women.

Some prominent AIDS experts doubt the schistosomiasis theory, pointing out, for example, that urban women raised far from infested water also die of AIDS. But proponents of the theory say that 2 decades ago, many experts were just as skeptical of the idea that circumcision protected men against HIV. It was not until 2006 that 3 clinical trials proved it correct.

Schistosomiasis "is arguably the most important cofactor in Africa's AIDS epidemic," said Dr Peter J Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. "And it's a huge women's health issue: Everyone has heard of genital mutilation and obstetric fistulas. But mention this, and the headlights just go dim."

The idea is slowly gaining ground. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the UN, the NIH, and the Danish and Norwegian governments have all given some grant support. But leaders of the 2 agencies that pay for the fight against global AIDS want more evidence before diverting funds from their campaigns for condoms, drugs, and circumcision. "We need to track all these things down and see what's a cause and what's just another disease you have at the same time, like cervical cancer," said Dr Mark R Dybul, executive director of one of the agencies, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.

An estimated 200 million Africans have had schistosomiasis. Although it is rarely fatal, the bleeding it causes in children can lead to anemia, stunted growth and learning problems. It is caused by tiny worms that live in freshwater snails and emerge with pointed heads that can penetrate the skin of people collecting water or washing clothes. Once inside, the worms mate, with the female living in a cleft in the male's body "like a hot dog in a bun," Dr Kjetland said. One form, _Schistosoma haematobium_, nest in [the veins of] urinary tract [laying eggs winding up in the bladder wall to be urinated out to complete the life cycle] -- bloody urine is the classic symptom -- but a portion of the eggs end up in the vaginal wall, creating "sandy patches" of damaged tissue and calcified eggs.

Studies by Dr Kjetland in Zimbabwe [see comment below] and South Africa and by Dr Jennifer A Downs of Weill Cornell Medical College in Tanzania have shown that women with the patches are about 3 times as likely as their neighbors to be infected with HIV.

For years, theories have abounded as to why African women become infected with HIV for example, that they are more likely to have overlapping sexual partners -- not always by choice -- while women elsewhere have boyfriends or husbands in series. That rape, incest, and domestic violence are rife in southern Africa, where the AIDS epidemic is worst. That syphilis and herpes are rampant. That impoverished, fatherless young women are forced to pay with sex for food, clothes, grades, and even car rides.

The schisto hypothesis can now be added to that list, but to some prominent experts it remains unlikely. One is Daniel Halperin, an epidemiologist now at the Ponce School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Puerto Rico. He knows how it feels to be doubted: in the 1990s, he was the chief proponent of the theory that circumcision protected men against HIV. He argues that tropical West Africa, where schisto is common, has little HIV, while countries with little schisto, like arid Botswana and mountainous Swaziland, have sky-high HIV rates.

Dr Salim Abdool Karim, a renowned South African AIDS researcher who admires Dr Kjetland's work, is also skeptical. His team follows more than 1000 women in an area only 40 miles [64 km] from Otimati with equally high HIV rates.

"We've studied genital tracts in detail for 20 years, photographing them sequentially," he said, "and we see no sandy patches." Upon hearing that, Dr Kjetland reached for the mounted magnifying scope she uses to examine girls. "They're not looking in the right places," she said. Most gynecologists, she explained, are trained to look for cancer, which usually starts near the center of the cervix, while sandy patches are tucked away in crevices that can be seen only by swinging the scope to extreme angles. It takes her weeks to train doctors to find them consistently, she said.

[Schistosomes (http://www.stanford.edu/class/humbio103/ParaSites2003/Schistosomiasis/cycle.htm) have a complex life cycle, in which cercariae, free-living in fresh water, can penetrate healthy human skin. The head of the cercaria transforms into an endoparasitic larva, the schistomule. The schistomules pass several days in the skin then enter the venous circulation and eventually migrate to the lungs (generally within 5 to 7 days of penetration). They then travel through the circulatory system to the heptoportal circulation (after 15 days) where they mature into adult worms and mate. Depending on the species, the schistosomes migrate to their final infection site either in the bladder venous system (_Schistosoma haematobium__ or the intestinal venous system (_S. mansoni_, _S. japanicum_, _S. intercalatum_) where the females begin egg production. These eggs are attached to the wall of colon or bladder from where they can be released into the lumen and are expelled in the feces or urine. The miracidium, liberated from the egg, seek out snail hosts where they enter a sporocyst stage that eventually results in free-living cercariae that seek out human hosts.

Genital schistosomiasis, usually from _S. haematobium_, occurs when the worms pass through the plexus of veins draining from the urinary bladder to those interconnecting veins draining the male or female genital organs. Dr Kjetland and colleagues have published a good review on female genital schistosomiasis (1) and stress that genital lesions, not necessarily with viable eggs, which may cause loss of mucosal integrity, pathological vessel morphology and contact bleeding can be found even after the excretion of _S. haematobium_ eggs in the urine has stopped. Whether urinary schistosomiasis is an independent variable in the acquisition of HIV or not may be difficult to cull from the data but clearly genital schistosomiasis is an underreported disease requiring more attention. It can be found even in infants from exposure to contaminated fresh water that the child is bathed in (2).

Of note, a recent article has been published describing a mouse model for female genital schistosomiasis which may help in sorting out the relationship of this disease and HIV (3).

"Design and methods: A cross-sectional study with a one-year follow-up. Gynecological and laboratory investigations were performed for _Schistosoma haematobium_ and HIV. Sexually transmitted infections, demographic, and urogenital history were analysed as confounders. The participants were 527 sexually active, non-pregnant, non-menopausal women between the ages of 20 and 49 years. The setting was a rural Zimbabwean community where _S. haematobium_ related lesions were found in 46 percent of the women, HIV in 29 percent and herpes simplex type-2 (HSV-2) in 65 percent.

Results: In permanent residents (greater than 3 years residency), HIV was found in 41 percent (29/70) of women with laboratory proven genital schistosomiasis as opposed to 26 percent HIV positive (96/375) in the schistosomal ova negative group [odds ratio (OR), 2.1; 95 percent confidence interval (CI), 1.2-3.5; P = 0.008. In multivariate analysis _S. haematobium_ infection of the genital mucosa was significantly associated with HIV seropositivity (adjusted OR, 2.9; 95 percent CI, 1.11-7.5; P = 0.030). All 7 women who became HIV positive during the study period (seroincidence 3.1 percent) had signs of _S. haematobium_ at baseline. In accordance with other studies HIV was significantly associated with HSV-2 (OR, 3.0; 95 percent CI, 1.7-5.3; P less than 0.001), syphilis and human papillomavirus. The highest HIV prevalence (45 percent) was found in the 25-29 years age group.

Conclusion: Women with genital schistosomiasis had an almost 3-fold risk of having HIV in this rural Zimbabwean community. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the association."

[More and more studies support the hypothesis that female genital schistosomiasis is an independent risk factor for HIV transmission. See for instance a recent review by Kjetland et al. 2014 (Kjetland EF et al. Genital schistosomiasis and its unacknowledged role on HIV transmission in the STD intervention studies. Int J STD AIDS. 2014 Mar 12. [Epub ahead of print]). Women with genital schistosomiasis experience bleeding easily which increases transmission. Whether the same is seen in male genital schistosomiasis is much less documented, but it is likely that bleeding into the semen may increase transmission risk from the male to the female partner. - Mod.EP]
