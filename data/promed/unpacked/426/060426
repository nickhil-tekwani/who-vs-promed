[Gopalpur is an Upazila of Tangail District in the Division of Dhaka, Bangladesh; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopalpur_Upazila. This is a fair distance from the outbreaks we have seen recently in Bangladesh. I fear that this may be indicating a repeat of the epidemic events of 2010. I hope I am wrong.

The government response has been good. But they must try to persuade owners of sick cattle to not be so charitable and to contact their veterinarian to have a diagnosis before thinking of butchering any sick beast. And with adequate and appropriate treatment not all sick animals die. - Mod.MHJ
