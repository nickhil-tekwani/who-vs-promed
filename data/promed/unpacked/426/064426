A mumps epidemic rages in Moldova
---------------------------------
Vasiliy Sokhotskiy, deputy director of the National Centre of Preventive
Medicine, told journalists today [23 Jan 2008] that the Ministry of Health
will order 600 000 doses of mumps vaccine urgently to tackle an epidemic of
mumps. To control the epidemic health care workers will immunize risk
groups who had not been vaccinated previously for various reasons.

More than 2000 cases have been recorded since the beginning of the year
[2008] in Kishinev, the Gagauzsky autonomic district, Ungensky, Orgeevsky,
and other districts of the Republic. The most affected are those in the
12-19 age group. The reason for this appears to be due to the fact that
many children born during the period from 1986 to 1994 immediately after
"perestroika" did not receive mumps vaccination for various reasons.

Mumps imported to Pridnestrovye from Moldova
--------------------------------------------
During the past 2 weeks, 16 cases of mumps have been registered in
Pridnestrovye. The deputy director of the Pridnestrovye Centre for Hygiene
and Epidemiology stated that in 5 cases the infection was among people who
had arrived from Moldova recently. He added that colleagues in Moldova sent
a warning at the beginning of December [2007] and measures were taken to
identify new cases and set up surveillance.

In the event of a perceived risk of an epidemic an emergency vaccination
campaign will be initiated. The deputy director was confident that all the
necessary supplies are available. He reminded journalists that mumps
vaccine is administered routinely to one year old children and
revaccination occurs at age 6-7 years. A mumps outbreak could occur,
however, as a delayed consequence of mass refusal of vaccination in the
1980s as a result of hostility in the mass media to compulsory mumps [MMR?]
vaccination.

According to the newspaper "Komsomolskaya Pravda in Moldova" since the
beginning of 2008 about 1200 cases mumps have been registered, whereas in
2006 there were 296 cases, and 1900 in 2007. Most cases were observed in
Kishinev, Orgeev, Ctrasheny, Nisporeny, Yaloveny, Kagul, Komrat, Rezina,
Teleneshty, Ungeny, Khyncheshty, Novye Aneny, and Floreshty. Fewer mumps
patients were recorded in the north of Moldova. The Moldovan experts
consider that the striking increase of mumps cases is connected with the
occurrence in the 1990s of problems with vaccines. Kishinev has already
approached the European Bureau of the World Health Organization (WHO) for
assistance in control of the mumps epidemic.

[This escalating outbreak of mumps appears to be an unintended consequences
of the breakup of the Soviet Union when a segment of the population did not
receive mumps vaccine during the late 1980s and the early 1990s.

According to Wikipedia the status of Transnistria is disputed. Although it
is de jure part of Moldova and is recognized as such by the international
community, Transnistria is not de facto under the control of the central
government of Moldova. It is administered by an unrecognized breakaway
authority under the name Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic. - Mod.CP]
