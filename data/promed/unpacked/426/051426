First records of Beet western yellows virus, Chickpea chlorotic dwarf
virus, Faba bean necrotic yellows virus and Soybean dwarf virus
infecting chickpea and lentil crops in Iran

[PPDRI, Tehran, Iran).
Accepted for publication 21/08/01
An intensive survey was conducted during May and June, 2001, to
identify virus diseases affecting [crops of chickpea (_Cicer
arietinum_ L.) and lentil (_Lens culinaris_ Medik.) in 5 provinces
(Qazvin, Kermanshah, Kurdistan, East Azarbaijan, and West Azarbaijan)
of Iran. ...
6979 chickpea and 1760 lentil samples were collected randomly from 51
chickpea and 13 lentil fields (100-150 samples per field). These
samples were tested for the presence of 13 different legume viruses by
the tissue-blot immunoassay procedure (Lin et al., 1990), using a
battery of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies.
Rabbit polyclonal antisera used were for Chickpea chlorotic dwarf
virus (CpCDV) (Horn et al., 1993), Pea enation mosaic virus (PEMV-1),
Alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV), Bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV), Broad
bean mottle virus (BBMV), Broad bean stain virus (BBSV), Cucumber
mosaic virus (CMV) and Pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV) (Virology
Laboratory, ICARDA, Aleppo, Syria).
5 monoclonal antibodies [were used for detection of Faba bean
necrotic yellows virus (FBNYV) (Franz et al., 1996), Beet western
yellows virus (BWYV) (ATCC PVAS-647), Soybean dwarf virus (SbDV) (ATCC
PVAS-650), Potato leaf roll virus (PLRV) (ATCC PVAS-649) and Bean leaf
roll virus (BLRV) (4B10) (Katul, 1992). Membranes blotted with cut
stem surfaces of chickpea or lentil infected with characterised
isolates of all the viruses tested served as positive controls, and
blots of healthy plants served as negative controls.
Overall incidence (% samples) in chickpea ... was 11.1%; CpCDV was the
most common ... (4.3%), followed by BLRV (4.1%), FBNYV (1.1%), BWYV
(0.9%), AlMV (0.4%), BYMV (0.2%), SbDV (0.1%) and PSbMV (0.01%).
...Overall virus disease incidence in lentil samples was 22.2%; PEMV-1
was the most common (8.9%), followed by BLRV (7.3%), FBNYV (2.7%),
PSbMV (1.8%), BBSV (0.7%), CpCDV (0.5%) and AlMV (0.3%). ... Marked
differences in ... disease incidence [were noted among regions, and
the highest incidence of virus infection in chickpea was in Kermanshah
province.
FBNYV and BLRV were detected in all 5 provinces surveyed; whereas,
CpCDV was detected in Kermanshah, Kurdistan and East Azarbaijan; BWYV
detected in Kermanshah and Kurdistan and SbDV was detected in
Kermanshah, Kurdistan and West Azarbaijan.
This is the first report of FBNYV, CpCDV, and BWYV naturally infecting
chickpea and lentil in Iran; and SbDV infecting chickpea in Iran and
probably in the world.

[This research provides a base for continued research and development
of strategies for disease management in Iran and elsewhere. Both the
International Center for Research in the Semi-Arid Tropics [ICRISAT,
based in India, and the International Center for Agricultural Research
in the Dry Areas [ICARDA in Syria have mandates for research and
development of both chickpea and lentil.
Chickpea has a wide range of adaptation and can be grown from the
Equatorial tropics to the temperate northern latitudes of Russia.
India is the major producer worldwide. It is an important food crop in
Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, and production has increased
in Australia, Mexico, and Turkey. Water deficits and soil-related
problems, as well as pests and diseases, cause some $2.5 billion
annual losses in chickpea production, according to ICRISAT. A joint
ICRISAT/ICARDA program has developed high yielding chickpea lines
resistant to the ascochyta pathogen, which causes losses up to 40
percent. Some 50 new cultivars released in 19 countries have helped
stabilize production and made winter sowing possible in the
Mediterranean region. Root rot-resistant, large-seeded materials have
been released for commercial production in North Africa.
Lentils originated in the Near East and are now produced in South
Asia, Northeast Africa, Eastern Europe,and North America. The major
lentil-producing regions are Asia (58% of the area) and the West
Asia-North Africa region (37% of the acreage of developing countries).
Lentil is the most important pulse in Bangladesh and Nepal, where it
significantly contributes to the diet. Farmers also grow lentils in
India, Iran, and Turkey. Other significant producers in the developing
world include Argentina, China, Ethiopia, Morocco, Pakistan, and
Syria. Production is expanding due to the rising demand of an
increasing population. Developing countries account for 87% of the
world's lentil[-producing area.
