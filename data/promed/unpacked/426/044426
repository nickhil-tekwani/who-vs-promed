WHO has issued a Corrigendum to the report of 2 imported cases of cholera
in Norway. It reads:
"Only 1 imported case should have been reported in WER No.32, p.248."

[This does not alter the fact that this case was imported from Pakistan, as
was a recent case in the UK, yet Pakistan has not declared to WHO that it
has any cholera. The strain is _Vibrio cholerae_ 01 El Tor, the same as is
causing the current epidemic in neighboring Afghanistan. - Mod.JW
