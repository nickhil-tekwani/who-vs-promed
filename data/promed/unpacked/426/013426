First Suspected Case of West Nile Virus Infection in North Dakota
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The first suspected case of West Nile virus in North Dakota has been
reported in a horse in Grand Forks County. Initial tests by the North
Dakota State Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and by the National
Veterinary Services Laboratory (Ames, Iowa) have confirmed the diagnosis,
but state officials are awaiting further test results from CDC in Atlanta.
The horse, a young gelding, began showing symptoms at the end of June; by
Sun 30 Jun 2002 the horse was laying down and could not move its back legs.
The horse continued to weaken and was euthanized on Tue 2 Jul 2002. Tissue
samples taken from the horse, including brain tissue, tested positive for
the West Nile virus.
Further information may be available from the office of the North Dakota
State Vetinarian, Larry Schuler, DVM. <lschuler@state.nd.us>

[This is the first report of West Nile virus activity in North Dakota since
the introduction of the virus into the United States in 1999. North Dakota
and Texas are approximately on the same north south longitudinal line
(<http://www.graphicmaps.com/webimage/countrys/usa.htm>) and represent the
furthest west extension of West Nile virus reported to date. - Mod.MPP]
