An East Timorese woman has died after [having been infected with japanese
encephalitis virus -- the first time the virus has been detected in the
region, U.N. officials said Friday. Dr. Alex Andjaparidze, who heads the
World Health Organization's team in Dili, said the woman tested positive
for the disease on May 11. She slipped into a coma and died two days later.
A 12-year-old girl from the same village in the Viqueque region, about 60
miles southeast of East Timor's capital, Dili, was hospitalized last week
after testing positive for the Japanese encephalitis virus. She was in a
stable condition Friday.
The region where the virus was detected has been cut off from the rest of
the island by monsoon rains that damaged roads and bridges.
