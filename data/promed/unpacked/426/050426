[In the ProMED-mail post entitled "Cowpox, bovine, human - Brazil (Sao
Paulo) 20030111,0095", the moderator questioned the precise identity of the
poxvirus responsible for the outbreak in Sao Paulo. The following
additional information has been received from Dr Marli Ueda of the Electron
Microscopy Section, Institute Adolfo Lutz, Sao Paulo. - Mod.CP]
I would like to comment on the ProMED-mail post of 11 Jan 2003 entitled
"Cowpox, bovine, human - Brazil (Sao Paulo)". My name is Marli Ueda and I
am the researcher responsible for the Electron Microscopy Section of the
Institute Adolfo Lutz, Sao Paulo, Brazil. I would like to explain that we
detected orthopoxvirus particles by electron microscopy negative staining
technique in 40 of the 70 samples of vesicular fluid of patients, [most of
whom are milkers from the region of the Paraíba valley, in the interior of
the Sao Paulo state, Brazil]. Currently, we are trying to culture the virus
on chorioallantoic membrane of chick embryo and also to carry out
nucleotide sequence analysis to identify and characterize these viruses.

[We await with interest the outcome of the diagnostic procedures now in
progress, which will allow precise identification of the orthopoxviruses
visualised by electron microscopy. For the non-virologist, the genus
_Orthopoxvirus_ comprises 8 distinct virus species: _Camelpox virus_,
_Cowpox virus_, _Ectromelia virus_, _Monkeypox virus_, _Raccoonpox virus_,
_Taterapox virus_, _Vaccinia virus_ and _Volepox virus_, plus the
eradicated _Variola virus_. As I reasoned previously the virus species
responsible for this outbreak may be Vaccinia virus rather than Cowpox
virus, which is a rodent poxvirus not previously isolated outside Europe. -
