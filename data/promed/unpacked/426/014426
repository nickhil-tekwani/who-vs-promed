Rabid fox found in Citrus Park
------------------------------
The Hillsborough County Health Department has been notified of 2 separate
incidents involving foxes about one half mile apart in the Citrus Park area
in north western Hillsborough County.

The 1st incident was a scratch, the 2nd involved a bite with the fox being
captured and testing positive for rabies. It cannot be determined if the
same fox was involved in both incidents. Individuals who have been bitten
or scratched by a wild animal should contact the Hillsborough County Health
Department. Rabies is fatal to humans and pets if appropriate preventative
measures are not taken.

It can be transmitted to humans through a wild animal's saliva from a bite
or a minor scratch. Residents are reminded not to interact with wild
animals. The best way to avoid exposure to rabies is to avoid direct
contact with wild animals. Wild animals may have rabies and can carry
rabies without showing any signs of the disease. Keep wild animals such as
foxes and raccoons out of the house and yard -- do not place feeders in the
yard. Protect pets by vaccinating them for rabies and keep their shots
up-to-date. Unsupervised outdoor pets are at risk for exposure to rabies
through contact with wild animals.

Eliminate artificial feeding sources -- don't leave food for pets in the
yard, especially at night, and secure trash cans with fasteners or enclose
them in lockable bins. Make sure bird feeders are not accessible to wild
animals; most squirrel-proof coverings also deter wild animals.

Rabies is a disease that affects the central nervous system. The rabies
virus is carried in the saliva of infected animals and is usually
transmitted to people and other animals when they are bitten or scratched
by the rabid animal. Rabies can be fatal to humans who do not seek prompt
medical attention after being exposed and unvaccinated pets. Vaccinated
pets require a booster vaccination after being exposed to provide full
protection. Post-exposure treatment is not routinely available for
unvaccinated pets.

Fox attacks Fort Pierce woman
-----------------------------
Authorities say a fox ran into a Fort Pierce woman's home and attacked her.
The St Lucie County Sheriff's Office reports that a grey fox about the size
of a house cat ran into the 58 year old woman's home on Tuesday [21 Apr
2009] night and bit her on the hand and on the leg. She told deputies she
managed to get the fox out of her home somehow. The fox also attacked a 17
year old neighbor's car, which might have hit the animal. The fox ran off
before deputies arrived, but St Lucie County animal control officials say
they found the animal dead in a neighbor's barn on Wednesday [22 Apr 2009].
Officials say they've sent the fox's head to the health department to have
it tested for rabies.
