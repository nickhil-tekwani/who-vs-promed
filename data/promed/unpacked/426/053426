Norwalk-like Virus Outbreak on Cruise Ship at Ft. Lauderdale from Alaska
-------------------------------------------------
Just saw your note on Norwalk Virus in New Zealand [see: Norwalk-like
virus, hotel - New Zealand 20021025.5637], and thought I should share this
information with you. My company performed a decontamination on a cruise
ship this week that docked in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, that just finished a
21-day cruise from Alaska. This was a Holland America ship called the
Amsterdam. There were 180 passengers and 28 crew members known to have
Norwalk-like virus infection. We proceeded to decontaminate the ship with
Virkon [Information on the exact composition of Virkon was not
available. According to numerous commercial websites, Vircon is "a
balanced, stabilised blend of peroxygen compounds, surfactant, organic
acids, and an inorganic buffer system. A 1% solution has a pH of
2.6. Virkon is a disinfectant, possessing wide spectrum bactericidal,
virucidal and fungicidal activity. Its activity is based on a buffered
synergized, acid peroxygen system containing a high percentage of
surfactant. This surfactant is a salt of a straight chain alkyl benzene
sulphonate which is readily degradable, giving more than 90%
biodegradability under test conditions. - Mod.MPP] . There were 3 members
from the CDC on board upon our arrival.

Re: Norwalk Virus Infection; Isolation Period Before Return to Work
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The ProMED-mail report entitled "Norwalk-like virus, hotel - New Zealand
20021025.5637" stated that: ".........staff were taking 48 hours off to
ensure they were clear of the virus before returning to work."
We are noting that in the cruise ship Industry (experiencing same problems)
[see part (1) above] that mandatory 72 hours isolation AFTER becoming
symptom-free is the minimum time frame acceptable.

[ProMED-mail thanks these contributors for providing different insights
into the same incident. It is intriguing that the reports of Norwalk-like
virus infection from North America relate predominantly to food-borne
outbreaks and outbreaks in recreational settings, whereas the reports from
Europe, and the UK in particular, concern outbreaks in health-care
establishments and schools. - Mod.CP]
[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a website on
cruise ship inspections (<http://www2.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/vspmain.asp>). As
part of this, there is a "green sheet" on results of routine ship
inspections, (<http://www2.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/VSP_RptGreenSheet.asp>) with
information on sanitation inspection scores. The particular ship
mentioned in the above outbreak had a sanitation inspection score of 96 on
29 Jun 2002. - Mod.MPP]
