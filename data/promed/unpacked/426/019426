The United States' worst measles outbreak in a quarter-century spread to Idaho and Virginia last week as public health authorities on Monday [10 Jun 2019] reported 41 new cases of the highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease. The USA has recorded 1022 cases of the disease in 2019 as of 6 Jun 2019, in an outbreak blamed on misinformation about vaccines, the CDC said. The 2019 outbreak, which has reached 28 states, is the worst since 1992, when 2126 cases were recorded.

Federal health officials attribute 2019's outbreak to parents who refuse to vaccinate their children. These parents believe, contrary to scientific evidence, that ingredients in the vaccine can cause autism. "We cannot say this enough: Vaccines are a safe and highly effective public health tool that can prevent this disease and end the current outbreak," Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement last week.

Measles was declared eliminated in the USA in 2000, meaning there was no continuous transmission of the disease for a year. Still, cases of the virus occur and spread via travelers coming from countries where measles is common. CDC officials have warned that the country risks losing its measles elimination status if the ongoing outbreak, which began in October 2018 in New York, continues until October 2019.

The nationwide measles outbreak shows no signs of slowing down, with the CDC recently releasing a report indicating there have been 971 confirmed cases [now 1022 - Mod.LL] so far in 2019, with fears the numbers may continue to climb through the summer and fall. Massachusetts is now part of the 26 states included in this outbreak, with a 2nd case confirmed last week in the eastern part of the state.

Though western Massachusetts has so far not seen any confirmed cases of measles, Dr. Michael Klatte, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Baystate Medical Center, told Reminder Publishing that may not continue to be the case. "Massachusetts as a whole has an extremely high rate of immunization of young children, but I think what people don't realize is that there are pockets acrossthe state -- including a number of them here in Western Mass -- where there are large numbers of under immunized and in some cases, unimmunized children, and that puts everyone at risk," Klatte said. He noted that the 4 counties in Western Massachusetts -- Franklin, Berkshire, Hampshire, and "to some extent, Hampden" -- have the highest vaccine exemption rate in the state outside of Cape Cod and the Islands. Most of these vaccine exemptions are recorded as being for religious reasons, Klatte added.

"Given how widespread the [measles] outbreak has been over the past year and a half, I wouldn't be surprised at all if we were to see active cases here in Western Mass.," Klatte shared.

According to the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MassDPH) website, Massachusetts requires that all healthcare workers, all school-aged children -- kindergarten through grade 12, and all students attending college in the Baystate -- be vaccinated against the measles with 2 doses of the MMR vaccine; the 1st dose is usually administered to children at 12-14 months and the 2nd dose at 2 to 4 years of age. Vaccination is also recommended for all health science students and all international travelers.

Vaccine exemptions are granted to individuals with allergies to gelatin, neomycin or a previous dose of the vaccine, women who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, and those with suppressed immune systems. Klatte said that to receive a religious exemption -- the most common exemption in our area -- a parent or guardian must fill out a form that indicates administering the vaccine would be in conflict with a parent's sincerely held religious beliefs.

[3] Texas: increased exemptions
Date: Fri 7 Jun 2019

https://communityimpact.com/dallas-fort-worth/frisco/healthcare/2019/06/07/vaccination-exemption-rates-grow-in-frisco-schools/


Vaccination exemptions for conscientious reasons continue rising in Frisco as a growing number of measles cases emerge across the country. The exemption rate for Frisco ISD has increased from 1.52% to 2.4% since the 2012-13 school year, whereas the rates for Leadership Prep School and Legacy Christian Academy have grown to 5.8% and 6.4%, respectively. Schools are not required to report which vaccines students are opting not to receive.

Nationwide, the 940 reported cases of the measles this year through 24 May 2019 [now 1022 - Mod.LL] is the largest number since the CDC declared the disease eradicated in 2000 in the USA. The majority of people who contracted the measles were unvaccinated, according to the CDC. Two measles cases were reported in Collin County and one in Denton County as of 31 May 2019, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.

Measles is so contagious that experts said as much as 95% of any given population needs to be vaccinated to prevent an outbreak. Leadership Prep School, Legacy Christian Academy and one FISD school have exemption rates of more than 5%, but it is unclear whether those students are exempt from the measles, mumps and rubella -- or MMR -- vaccine.

Collin and Denton counties are following the trend of other places in Texas, as more and more people are choosing not to vaccinate their children, said Juan Rodriguez, the Denton County chief epidemiologist. Rodriguez said he expects exemption rates to keep rising while diseases, such as whooping cough and the measles, make a comeback. "The reason why less and less people stopped having these diseases is because of vaccinations," he said. "These diseases were almost eliminated, and now they are making a resurgence because people are choosing not to vaccinate."

Dr. Jawaid Asghar, the Collin County chief epidemiologist, said parents with higher education levels are often the ones choosing not to vaccinate their children. "There is hesitation and misinformation out there," he said. "Also, the studies that came about autism and MMR, the CDC proved it not to be true based on fact, but still there is a lot of misinformation out there on [vaccinations]."

Vaccinations are vital to protecting the community at large, said Chris Van Deusen, the DSHS director of media relations. "It just takes one person who is not immunized to take a trip to Europe or Asia, where measles is much more common than it is here, and they come back, and they are in a community or population where immunization rates are low for some reason," Van Deusen said. "That could spread very, very quickly."

The Texas Legislature passed a law in 2003 that allows vaccination exemptions for "reasons of conscience." A conscientious exemption allows a student to opt out of a vaccine when there is a religious, philosophical or moral objection to it. Texas also allows exemptions for medical reasons. Conscientious exemptions require a notarized letter from a child's guardian and remain valid for 2 years.

Special statement by His Excellency the Minister of Health concerning the measles epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo
------------------------
Since the beginning of 2019, we have seen an increase in the number of suspected cases of measles with a total of 87 000 suspected cases until week 20, with an estimated lethality of 1.8%. The INRB laboratory confirmed 677 measles cases in 516 health areas, located in 83 health zones in 23 provinces of the country.

This situation is all the more worrying because it represents an increase of more than 33%, compared to the epidemiological situation for the same period in 2018. For the whole of 2018, the country had notified 65 098 suspected cases of measles, of which 2908 cases were investigated, of which 961 were confirmed with a lethality of 1.3%. There were 18 provinces out of 26 (69%) that had each registered at least one health zone in a measles epidemic.

This increase in suspected cases of measles above the expected values since the beginning of 2019, with a greater proportion of the cases confirmed by the laboratory, allows us to affirm the persistence of the measles epidemic in the country. Also, in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization and within the framework of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), we declare the measles epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Since 2001, the Democratic Republic of Congo has been implementing strategies to reduce measles mortality in the African region. In November 2012, the DRC adopted a strategic plan for the elimination of measles 2012-2020, with as strategic axes: the care of the sick, the reinforcement of the routine vaccination, the organization of the campaigns, preventive and reactive, strengthening surveillance, and monitoring and evaluation.

Routine immunization activities have been intensified, and mass measles immunization campaigns have been organized in some provinces between August 2016 and February 2017. Despite these measures, enormous challenges remain in some provinces where children have difficulty accessing immunization services due to the context of insecurity, inaccessibility to vaccination sites, intense movements of populations and the existence of groups refractory to vaccination.

Taking into account the current upsurge of suspected cases of measles and the ever-increasing number of affected areas across the country, more effective measures are needed to control this epidemic. These measures consist of the organization of mass vaccination campaigns against measles targeting among others:

- Children from 6 to 59 months;
- Improving the management of measles cases in all health facilities in the country;
- Strengthening surveillance of measles cases;
- Improving the nutritional status of children through the vitamin A supplementation campaign.

Thus, from 19-23 Apr 2019, 2 247 240 children aged 6-59 months were vaccinated against measles in 63 health zones. A 2nd mass vaccination campaign targeting 1 435 314 children aged 6-59 months will be launched in the coming days in 39 health zones, as well as any health zone that will subsequently be confirmed as an epidemic.

In addition, an emergency plan for the revival of routine immunization, called Plan Mashako, was launched in October 2018, and the results of the 1st quarterly review are encouraging.
