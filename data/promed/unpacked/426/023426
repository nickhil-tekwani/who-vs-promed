Prevention of swimmers itch
---------------------------------
Swimmer's itch is well recognized in Minnesota lakes, and as someone
whose children have been afflicted, I can tell you the itching is
extremely intense. There are actually preventive measures, such as
immediately toweling off after being in water that might have
_cercaria_, which is an immature stage of a blood fluke that causes
swimmer's itch. In addition, affected water sources can be treated
with copper sulfate. The Minnesota Department of Resources has some
great information on this issue at:

[ProMED thanks Kathleen Harriman for her comments. The problem with
preventive measures is that it must be recognized that there are
_cercariae_ in the water before such measures can be taken. We are
not sure whether spraying with copper sulfate will have adverse
consequences on water ecology. The present outbreak was unusual in
the number of persons affected at the same time. - Mod.EP]
[As an additional aside, copyeditor MSP mentioned that as a kayaker
in lakes in Massachusetts, he has encountered the _cercariae_ in at
least one of the lakes where he has gone kayaking. Hence, the
schistosomes are present in Massachusetts as well. - Mod.MPP]
