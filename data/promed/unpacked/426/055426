EHEC cases from an international football tournament in Sweden, Jul 2004
--------------------------------------------------
An enterohaemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) O157 VT1 and VT2 outbreak associated
with a large international youth football tournament has now been
preliminarily investigated. Information has already been disseminated
internationally through Enter-net, the international surveillance network
for human gastrointestinal infections
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpa/inter/enter-net_menu.htm>), and ProMED-mail [1].
As of 1 Sep 2004, the outbreak includes 18 cases: 9 verified, 2 suspected,
4 possible and 2 secondary cases. Only a single case is in a patient from
outside Sweden. All patients (with the exception of the secondary cases)
participated in the Gothia Cup (for more information, see
<http://www.gothiacup.se>) in Goteborg between 11-17 Jul 2004.
The Gothia Cup is the world's largest youth football tournament, and this
year celebrated its 30th anniversary, with 32 100 participants from 61
nations. The mean age of the participants is 15.5 years. Most of the
primary cases are in patients aged between 15 and 20 years old, and a team
leader. The identified patients all ate at 8 of the 36 schools serving food
to tournament participants. The food had been obtained from the same
distributors, but had been prepared in 20 different schools. Only a few
food items could be traced and sampled at the time of the outbreak, all
with negative results.
The bacterial isolates have shown minor variations by PFGE but are
considered to belong to one unique clone. A case control study has been
initiated and is ongoing.

[Fortunately, the scope of this outbreak appears to be small, especially
given the number of participants and the geographic diversity of the group.
