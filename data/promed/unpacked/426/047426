Influenza update 346 (based on data up to 7 Jul 2019)
-----------------------------------------------------
Information in this report is categorized by influenza transmission zones, which are geographical groups of countries, areas or territories with similar influenza transmission patterns.

Summary
-------
- In the temperate zones of the southern hemisphere, trends in influenza activity varied by region and country. Activity in Argentina, Australia, and Uruguay increased while activity in Brazil, Chile, New Zealand, Paraguay, and South Africa decreased this period.
-- Influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominated in Oceania and South Africa.
-- Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated in temperate South America.
- In Southern Asia, influenza activity was low across reporting countries, except in Bangladesh where activity remained high with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominant. In South East Asia, an increase in influenza activity was observed in a few reporting countries.
- In the Caribbean, Central America, and tropical South America, influenza activity was low in general, with exception of Costa Rica and Panama where influenza A virus activity was high, and in Cuba and French Guiana (France) where influenza virus detections increased.
- In Africa, with the exception of South Africa, influenza activity was low across reporting countries.
- In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza activity was at inter-seasonal levels.
- Worldwide, seasonal influenza A viruses accounted for the majority of detections.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 91 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 24 Jun 2019 to 7 Jul 2019 (data as of 19 Jul 2019 03:31:54 UTC). The WHO GISRS [Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System] laboratories tested more than 49384 specimens during that time period. 5748 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 3894 (67.7%) were typed as influenza A and 1854 (32.3%) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 973 (37.3%) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1634 (62.7%) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 43 (4.4%) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage and 930 (95.6%) to the B/Victoria lineage.

Source of data
--------------
The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks. The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System), FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.
