Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: Following the 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak that occurred in central Minnesota, increased surveillance has been implemented during the spring and fall months. This routine surveillance detected a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 in a commercial meat-type turkey flock. The flock was healthy and not showing any clinical signs of AI. Partial HA/NA sequencing determined the H5 and N2 to be a low pathogenic virus of North American wild bird lineage. Further characterization is pending virus recovery. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health (BAH) and USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) are conducting an epidemiological investigation of the event and have increased surveillance in the area as a result of this detection. State officials have quarantined the affected premises and implemented movement controls. Turkeys from this premises will be depopulated through controlled marketing.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; zoning; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: disinfection
