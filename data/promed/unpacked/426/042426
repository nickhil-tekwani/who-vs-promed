Yellow fever in the Democratic Republic of Congo
------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is launching an emergency mass vaccination campaign against yellow fever from 20 Jun 2013, following laboratory confirmation of 6 cases in the country on 6 Jun 2013.

The 6 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported from 3 health zones [in Kasai-Oriental province]: Lubao (4 cases), Kamana (1 case) and Ludimbi-Lukula (1 case). They were identified through the national surveillance programme for yellow fever. The laboratory confirmation was done by the Institute Pasteur in Dakar, Senegal, a WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever.

Preliminary outbreak investigation revealed that the index case is a 16 year old boy from Kisengua village in the Lubao Health Zone who became ill on 1 Mar 2013. The outbreak investigation team has also identified 51 suspected cases, including 19 deaths, in the 3 health zones. Serum samples have been taken from 13 patients and are being analyzed in the National Institute of Biomedical Research (INRB).

The mass vaccination campaign aims to cover at least 503 426 people in the 3 affected health zones.

The International Coordinating Group on Yellow Fever Vaccine Provision (YF-ICG) will provide 559 000 doses of yellow fever vaccine for the mass vaccination campaign run by the Ministry of Health in DRC, with support from the GAVI Alliance, Medicins Sans Frontiers (MSF) and other partners. WHO is closely supporting the management of the outbreak in monitoring, preventive and control activities in the field, and resource mobilization.

The YF-ICG is a partnership that manages the stockpile of yellow fever vaccines for emergency response on the basis of a rotation fund. It is represented by United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), MSF, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and WHO, which also serves as the Secretariat. The stockpile is supported by the GAVI Alliance.

[Through the ongoing national yellow fever [YF] surveillance program, a total of 6 YF cases dating back to March 2013 have been confirmed in 3 health zones in Kasai-Oriental province. And following extended epidemiological investigations into the cases, an additional 51 suspected YF cases with 19 deaths were identified, signaling the presence of a huge YF outbreak in the province; hence, reactive YF vaccination is slated for 20 Jun 2013. Further etiological information on whether the outbreak is due to sylvatic or urban transmission vectors would be appreciated.

[Yellow fever occurs sporadically in rural areas of the DRC. Cases occurred in 2008, 2010, and 2012. Unlike the outbreak mentioned above by Mod.JFW, the previous 2010 and 2012 cases were single ones that were identified through the national surveillance programme for yellow fever. Laboratory confirmation was done at Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale Kinshasa (INRB) and reconfirmed by a WHO regional reference laboratory for yellow fever, Institut Pasteur, Dakar, Senegal. The 2008 outbreak was larger and 10 deaths were reported in Lutembo in south west Democratic Republic of Congo among diamond miners expelled from Angola, but were not laboratory confirmed. - Mod.TY]
