Update on human cases of highly pathogenic avian
influenza A (H5N1) infection in 2009
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
During 2009, 73 laboratory-confirmed cases of
human infection with highly pathogenic avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus were reported to the WHO
from 5 countries. This report summarizes these cases.

Temporal and geographical distribution:
---------------------------------------
The 73 laboratory-confirmed cases of H5N1 virus
infection were reported from Cambodia (1 case),
China (7), Egypt (39), Indonesia (21) and Viet
Nam (5); all of these countries had reported
human cases of H5N1 previously. Circulation of
highly pathogenic H5N1 virus in poultry is
considered to be endemic in these countries, with
the exception of Cambodia, where poultry
outbreaks occur sporadically. As in previous
years, an increase in cases was reported during
the northern hemisphere's winter and spring
seasons [These data are illustrated graphically
in the original text]. Reports of outbreaks among
animals also tended to increase during the same period.

Distribution by sex and age:
----------------------------
In 2009, the overall ratio of male cases (n=35)
to female cases (n=38) was almost even (ratio of
males to females, 0.92). However, Indonesia
reported twice as many cases in females as in
males (ratio, 0.5). Cases ranged in age from 6
months to 57 years, with a median age of 5 years.
The low median age was due primarily to the high
proportion of cases occurring among children in
Egypt; Egypt accounted for 53 percent of all
cases worldwide. The age of cases in Egypt was
notably younger than elsewhere, with a median age
of 3 years; 80 percent of cases occurred in children aged less than 10 years.

Outcome:
--------
The overall case-fatality ratio (CFR) for 2009
was 44 percent, lower than the previous 2 years
but similar to the CFR in 2005 [These data are
tabulated in the original text]. CFRs varied
widely among countries. Egypt reported its lowest
CFR (10 percent) since 2003. In all countries,
the CFR was lower for cases aged less thjan 10
years than for cases aged greater than or equal
to 10 years (24 percent versus 71 percent; odds
ratio [OR], 7.8; 95 percent confidence interval
[CI], 2.7­22.4). In contrast to previous years,
the CFR for females in all countries was higher
than for males, but the difference was not
significant (50 percent versus 37 percent; OR,
1.7; 95 percent CI, 0.7­4.3); this pattern was not consistent among countries.

Discussion:
-----------
With almost double the number of human cases of
H5N1 reported in 2009 compared with 2008, and
with continuing circulation of the virus among
certain poultry populations, it is clear that
H5N1 remains a concern for both animal health and
public health. Although the CFR remains high,
there are differences among affected countries.
These data do not allow a determination of the
causes of this difference to be made. Possible
explanations for the disparities among countries
might include differences in the type or
intensity of exposure, in health-seeking
behaviour, in testing or treatment practices, or
even in the virulence of virus strains. The
marked difference in the age distribution of
cases among countries makes a direct comparison
of risk factors difficult, given the relatively
small total number of cases available for
analysis. At present, this remains an avian virus
that has not demonstrated a facility for
human-to-human transmission, and human infections remain rare and sporadic.

A total of 3 clusters, each involving 2 family
members and without sustained human-to-human
transmission, were documented in 2009. It is
notable that all cases have occurred in countries
with ongoing circulation or reintroduction of
highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses
in poultry. Globally, better management of
outbreaks in poultry in many countries has led to
a decrease in virus circulation and a decreased
risk of human exposure. However, human exposure
and cases can continue to be expected whenever the virus is circulating.

Efforts should be intensified to decrease both
circulation in poultry and the risk of human
exposure. Influenza viruses mutate constantly,
and vigilance must be maintained. Surveillance of
influenza in humans and animals should be
strengthened to enable timely detection of
epidemiological, clinical and virological
changes. The rapid sharing of information
globally is essential to ensure a quick and
comprehensive assessment and global response.

[This statement provides a useful review of the
current situation. So far in 2010 there have been
7 additional cases, all in Egypt and unrelated.
The essential message is that at present, highly
pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus remains
an avian virus that has not demonstrated a
facility for human-to-human transmission, and
human infections remain rare and sporadic.
Efforts should be intensified to decrease both
circulation of this virus in poultry to reduce
the risk of human exposure. - Mod.CP]
