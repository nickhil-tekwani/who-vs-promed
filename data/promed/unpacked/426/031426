Reuters has reported that a flu-like illness has affected thousands of
children in Sri Lanka, killing at least 15. The symptoms are fever,
coughing, vomiting and stomach pains.
The acting director of the Lady Ridgway Hospital in the capital city of
Colombo said that there has been a 33 percent increase in admissions over
the last three weeks.
The director of the National Hospital said the illness has, until this
week, affected more children than adults. Some doctors have speculated
that a contributing factor could be the intense heat experienced during the
past weeks.
A report on the epidemic from Sri Lanka's Medical Research Institute is
expected shortly.
Update: 23 Apr 1998
-------------------
The number of cases treated daily in Colombo is reported to have risen from
200 to 700.
Some doctors are saying that the illness may be due to two or more strains
of influenza.
