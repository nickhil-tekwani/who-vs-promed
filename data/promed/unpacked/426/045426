Eight more cases of hepatitis-B were reported on Tuesday [6 Sep 2011]
from Aluva and Paravoor districts. As the epidemic is spreading to
other parts of the Ernakulam district, health authorities have adopted
various measures to check the spread (of the infection). But the new
cases reported put a big question mark on how effective the measures
taken by the health department are.

After various cases were reported from different parts of
Kothamangalam [another town located in an eastern part of Ernakulam
district], the authorities started various health camps and fever
clinics in the area. The health officials also initiated field visits,
which they claim have helped reduce the spread of hepatitis B. "For
the last one week, things [have been] under our control. No fresh
cases have been reported in Kothamangalam in the last 2 days," said
district medical officer Dr. R Sudhakaran. "Even though the health
department is taking several measures, without public cooperation, we
cannot stop the spread of this epidemic," he added.

This press report does not indicate the route of spread of hepatitis B
virus infection nor the specific measures employed by the authorities
to contain this outbreak. Clarification is requested.

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause
both acute and chronic disease. The virus is transmitted through
contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person, not
through casual contact. According to the World Health Organisation
(WHO), about 2 billion people worldwide have been infected with the
virus, and about 350 million live with chronic infection. An estimated
600 000 persons die each year due to the acute or chronic consequences
of hepatitis B. About 25 percent of adults who become chronically
infected during childhood later die from liver cancer or cirrhosis of
the liver caused by the chronic infection. The hepatitis B virus is 50
to 100 times more infectious than HIV.

Hepatitis B virus is an important occupational hazard for health
workers, but hepatitis B is preventable with a safe and effective
vaccine. A vaccine against hepatitis B has been available since 1982.
This vaccine is 95 percent effective in preventing hepatitis B virus
infection and its chronic consequences. Hepatitis B is endemic in many
parts of Asia. Most people in the region become infected with
hepatitis B virus during childhood. In these regions, 8-10 percent of
the adult population are chronically infected.

Hepatitis B virus is transmitted between people by contact with the
blood or other body fluids (i.e. semen and vaginal fluid) of an
infected person. Modes of transmission are the same for the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but hepatitis B virus is 50 to 100 times
more infectious. Unlike HIV, hepatitis B virus can survive outside the
body for at least 7 days. During that time, the virus can still cause
infection if it enters the body of a person who is not infected.

Common modes of transmission in developing countries are: perinatal;
early childhood infections, inapparent infection through close
interpersonal contact with infected household contacts, unsafe
injections practices; blood transfusions and sexual contact. Further
