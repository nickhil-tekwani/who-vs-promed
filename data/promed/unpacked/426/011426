Connecticut to 4. The same press release states that 2 of the 3 human
cases in Connecticut (both in their 60's) are now recovering, but an
older patient remains in hospital. So far this year, 117 212 mosquitoes
have been tested in Connecticut, with 22 isolations of West Nile virus
and 6 isolations of Eastern equine encephalitis virus. - Mod.CP
