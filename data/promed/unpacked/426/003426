Leptospirosis -- a bacterial disease that spreads through the urine of infected animals such as rats and cattle -- has emerged as the biggest killer among monsoon diseases. Data gathered from the civic body [Mumbai] shows that 70 people have succumbed due to leptospirosis over the past 6 years. In comparison, dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, has killed 55 people and malaria has killed 38 people during the same period.

The leptospirosis infection is caused by the _Leptospira_ bacteria that can enter the human body through cuts, abrasions or open wounds. The cases of leptospirosis are typically during monsoon and after flooding events, when people are forced to wade through water. However, doctors say that a few sporadic cases are reported throughout the year from areas with overflowing sewers, water accumulation, and a general lack of cleanliness.

Since 2015, the city has recorded 1576 cases of leptospirosis, according to civic data. However, this data captures patients who were admitted only in the civic-run hospitals. A large number of patients could be treated in private hospitals and on an outpatient department basis as well.

"Mortality in leptospirosis is generally seen when patients seek medical advice very late," said Dr Wiqar Shaikh, professor of medicine at the state-run JJ Hospital [Mumbai]. "One of the severe impacts of leptospirosis is swelling in the liver, which may worsen in cases of late diagnosis. Also, patients with existing comorbidities can have a severe impact," he said adding that since June this year [2021], he has treated around 40 patients with leptospirosis.

Once confirmed with the infection, patients are treated with the antibiotic drug doxycycline. The civic body also advises taking the drug as a prophylactic if someone has waded through floodwater. "But there is absolutely no awareness about it among the people," said Shaikh. "Many patients who come to us have no clue about what leptospirosis is. There is a dire need for awareness in the communities," he said.

Physician Dr Gautam Bhansali said that leptospirosis also becomes fatal in cases where patients have extremely low platelet count, which puts them at the risk of bleeding. "Due to COVID-19, patients are seeking medical help as soon as they develop symptoms like fever. It has helped in early diagnosis of other diseases like leptospirosis," he said. Bhansali has seen 4 cases of leptospirosis this monsoon season.

The pediatric department of civic-run LTMG [Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General] Hospital in Sion [Mumbai], which caters to people from Dharavi and nearby areas, has seen a spurt in cases this year. In 2020, the department had recorded 43 leptospirosis cases in all. This year, the number has touched 62, 3 months before the year-end. The department has also recorded 6 leptospirosis deaths among children this year [2021]. "The children that we lost were all brought in extremely late to the hospital," said Dr Radha Gulati Ghildiyal, head of the paediatrics department at the LTMG hospital. "Majority of them developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and had a history of wading through water," she said. The civic data, however, has counted only 4 leptospirosis deaths in Mumbai this year so far. The other deaths are currently under the review of the death committee.

Hindustan Times had sought 10-year data on monsoon related diseases; however, the civic body said that the data between 2011 and 2014 was currently unavailable. Data collated from previous reports show that Mumbai had recorded 135 cases of leptospirosis in 2010, 141 in 2011 and 151 in 2012. The city had recorded 18, 6 and 2 deaths due to bacterial infection, respectively. Cumulative data for 2013 and 2014 was not available.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is widely distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of _Leptospira_-infected animals or by contact with water, wet soil, or vegetation that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. _Leptospira_ may survive in warm fresh water or soil flooded with fresh water for weeks to months. Drinking contaminated water or food can also cause infection.

In carrier animals with chronic renal infections, _Leptospira_ are excreted in urine for long periods or for the life of the animal. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic _Leptospira_. Mice, as well as rats, can carry _Leptospira_ in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Prevalence of particular leptospiral serovars vary by geographical region.

Human activities that place people at increased risk of leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, gardening, or farming, and working in piggeries. Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease, such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever.

Leptospirosis is also a risk during recreational activities, such as camping, fresh water swimming, canoeing, kayaking, rafting, golfing, and trail biking, that involve exposure to water in lakes, rivers, or ponds contaminated by urine from _Leptospira_-infected animals (https://www.cdc.gov/leptospirosis/exposure/index.html).

Because of the relatively nonspecific nature of the clinical presentation of leptospirosis, its diagnosis cannot be made confidently without laboratory confirmation (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). However, laboratory diagnosis for leptospirosis may not be not widely available at a local level. Dr. Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic that of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. For very ill patients, intensive care support and intravenous (IV) antibiotics may be necessary. In a flood-affected area, leptospirosis chemoprophylaxis is 200 mg of doxycycline, once a week for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this.

Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation. Mumbai, with a population of more than 12 million people, is always badly hit during the monsoon season (June to September), with heaviest rainfall in July and August. Mumbai was especially hard-hit in July this year [2021] by heavy rainfall and flooding (https://www.skymetweather.com/content/weather-news-and-analysis/mumbai-receives-highest-rains-of-monsoon-2021-more-showers-in-store/). - Mod.ML
