Anthrax hits Luangwa
--------------------
Anthrax has broken out in Luangwa district with the lower Zambezi
national park being the hardest hit. Many animals especially Hippos
have already died.

Luangwa acting district commissioner Musole Siachisa has appealed to
people in the district not to eat and touch carcasses found floating
in the river. Mr Siachisa also appealed to members of the public not
to buy Hippo meat from traders crossing the borders from neighbouring
countries.

He says there is need for members of the public to cooperate with
medical personnel and government to ensure that the disease is brought
under control.

[It is hard to say whether this is a resurgence of the problems
earlier this year (see postings below) or merely an ongoing problem
abutting the Christmas holidays necessitating public health warnings.
It is probably both. In spite of the brave words spoken in November
wildlife anthrax is notoriously hard to control. On 4 Nov2011, more
than 100 affected hippo were reported in this area; see 20111117.3392.
