Venezuela investigates mass poisoning
-------------------------------------
Venezuela's health authorities are investigating the intoxication of
some 200 people on the coast of Choroni, in northern Aragua state,
central Venezuela, where some 3000 people were evacuated from the
beaches by officials Civil Protection (PC) officials.

The regional director of health of the government of Aragua, Angel
Melchor, explained that the events occurred last Saturday [28 Aug
2010], but the problem remains and local authorities investigating the
causes of this massive allergy are still on alert.

The official explained that there is something in the environment that
causes "irritation", which affects the eyes and causes headaches and
itching of the skin, and which has forced the evacuation of 3000
people, residents and visitors, from the shores of Choroni.

The chief of PC in the region, Salvador Basile, said the case was
reported in Playa Grande, one of the spas of the coastal town of
Choroni in the extreme north of the municipality of Girardot.

The spa was temporarily closed and about 200 people were treated at
the local clinic for nasal congestion, breathing problems, and eye
irritation, said the civil protection official.

In response, health authorities have said they are already
investigating the composition of the waters, rivers, vegetation,
surrounding areas, houses, factories, and shops, looking for the
causes of this mass intoxication.

[This sounds like the effects of red tide and the spray from water
affecting the respiration, noses, and eyes of people, while the water
produces more of a skin allergic type of reaction. While this is
reported as a spa, it sounds very much like a beach resort.

There are a variety of organisms that can produce what is known as red
tide. While we have no reports of red tide in the area, it is
typically only the large blooms that are reported as they can be seen
from the air. - Mod.TG]
