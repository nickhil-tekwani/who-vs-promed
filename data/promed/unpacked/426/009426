Suspected western beet virus in WA's south-west
-----------------------------------------------
A virus new to south-west Western Australia is suspected to be
affecting cauliflower and broccoli crops around Manjimup. About half a
dozen growers are experiencing stunted vegetable crops by what they
think is the western beet virus.

A brassica grower says the virus is likely to have been transported
by aphids, which are in high numbers in the area this year [2011].
"The aphids bring in the virus I believe from canola or radish, infect
the [vegetable] plants and then the plants just struggle to grow. They
tend to seed up earlier and send out a lot of side shoots which
doesn't allow them to grow and you just get very small and possibly
uncuttable plants."

Tomato virus goes north
-----------------------
A virus that can destroy tomato plantations has spread to Far North
Queensland. _Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ can stunt plants, and was
first discovered in Brisbane 5 years ago [ProMED-mail post
20060330.0967]. The disease has now been identified in the Atherton
Tablelands, near Cairns.

Gary Fullilove, science leader with the Queensland Government, is
concerned the tomato yellow leaf curl is likely to spread to other
growing areas. "My gut feeling is that it will. And what we're trying
to do is, make the when as far away as possible, so that if we do find
it there, we've got access to very good quality resistant varieties."

[_Beet western yellows virus_
----------------------------
_Beet western yellows virus_ (BWYV; genus _Polerovirus_) affects over
150 species including, for example, crops like beets, lettuce,
sunflower, cabbage, bean, pea, chickpeas, tomato, capsicum, and
cucumber. Poleroviruses are largely confined to phloem tissue
resulting in yellowing symptoms but may invade non-phloem tissue when
co-infecting with, for example, potyviruses. BWYV causes progressive
yellowing and loss of plant vigour in most of its hosts. Degree of
damage depends upon virulence and persistence of the virus strain, as
well as susceptibility of the crop variety.

BWYV is transmitted by several aphid vectors in a persistent manner
and retained when the insects moult. It has no other means of spread.
Disease management may be attempted by controlling vector insects and
reducing the amount of available reservoir plants.

_Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_
-------------------------------
_Tomato yellow leaf curl virus_ (TYLCV; genus _Begomovirus_)
originates from the Middle East and is one of the most damaging
viruses of tomato worldwide. It can also affect a number of other
solanaceous and leguminous hosts. Symptoms on tomato include small
chlorotic puckered leaves and stunting of plants. Yield losses of up
to 80 percent have been reported.

The virus is transmitted in a persistent manner by the silverleaf
whitefly (_Bemisia tabaci_ biotype B), which in itself is a serious
pest of tomatoes and other vegetable crops. TYLCV can also be
transmitted by mechanical inoculation (poorly) and by grafting, but is
not transmitted by seed or contact between plants.

Disease management may include use of certified vector and virus free
planting material, cultural practices, and removal of infected crop
residues and possible pathogen and/or vector reservoirs to reduce
inoculum. Control of the vector is most important, but this may cause
problems of chemical residues on the fruit and is extremely difficult
in open field situations due to the widespread presence and wide host
range of the vector.

Field cropping of tomatoes has been abandoned in some areas due to
TYLCV. Tomato cultivars with increased levels of resistance or
tolerance are available. Transgenic tomato plants incorporating TYLCV
capsid protein genes have been found to be resistant to the virus.
