Ghana's Ministry of Health will start recruiting and training volunteers in
seven regions in the development of a community based surveillance system
which aims at early detection and control of diseases. Speaking to
reporters in Accra on Wednesday, George Amofah, deputy director of public
health, said the volunteers would collaborate with sub- district health
authorities in data collection on diseases and report events such as
unusual deaths, the Ghana News Agency reported Wednesday. Other
responsibility of the volunteers will be to report on non-disease situation
in addition to keeping a community register of births and deaths.
Amofah said, "Surveillance involves data collection, analysis,
interpretation and the action needed to contain epidemics." He said the
program which has been piloted in the three northern regions is being
extended to the other regions and would help in general disease control and
also serve as tool to check epidemics.
The national program is yet to take off because volunteers would have to be
trained to detect symptoms of diseases while training manuals would also
have to be developed for them. The western, Ashanti, central and greater
Accra regions have already started incorporating the community based
surveillance system into their plan of action on a small scale.
The program will cover a wide range of diseases since every community or
region is known to have locally endemic diseases such as guineaworm and
buruli ulcer which are common in certain parts of the country.
Amofah said that non-communicable diseases such as cancer, diabetes,
hypertension and other cardio-vascular diseases, which are not opened to
community action will continue to be handled by health institutions.
The non communicable diseases program at the Korle Bu Teaching Hospital
aims at educating and reaching the larger public through the formation of
associations such as the Diabetes Association of Ghana to help in the early
detection and management of these public health problems.
