Two districts of Moscow quarantined following rabies alert
----------------------------------------------------------
A total of 3 people have been hospitalized in Moscow on suspicion of
rabies virus infection after being bitten by a suspected rabid dog.
The 1st case of animal rabies for this year [2009] was recorded
recently in north Moscow following the arrival of a rabid dog brought
in from the surrounding area.

Moscow Oblast veterinarians state that 230 cases of animal rabies had
been reported this year so far, which is more than for the whole of
last year. The death of a 6-month-old pup alarmed city veterinarians
because this rabid animal had roamed freely around north Moscow for 2
months. Concerned Muscovites took the the pup in and gave it a home.
But shortly afterwards the pup was passed on to new carers. Later the
pup bit a one of its new carers but no one paid serious attention to
this event. Subsequently the pup was returned to its previous owners.
Later the pup became unwell and was taken to a veterinary clinic
where it died 3 days later.

As a result a quarantine was imposed immediately in the 2 districts
of Moscow. All pets were called in for immunization. All cats and
dogs in neighborhoods in these 2 districts are considered to be at
risk and must be immunised and kept in isolation for 60 days. All
owners of pets are recommended to avoid travelling between quarantine
zones and all animal trade and exhibitions are prohibited.

Stray animals remain a concern and it has been decided to enhance the
collection and containment of all stray animals in the north of the
city. Veterinarians consider that ignorance of basic rules of animal
welfare are responsible for this situation.

Currently 3 people are being treated in hospital and several others
as out-patients. The quarantine will be lifted only after 60 days of
freedom from animal rabies.

[It is not clear from this report whether rabies virus infection has
been diagnosed in any of the 3 patients being treated in hospital.
Likewise it is unclear whether any animals, other than the deceased
pup, have been confirmed as rabies virus infected. Further
information would be appreciated, and for the benefit of visitors, as
well as residents, notification of the date of expiry of the
quarantine. - Mod.CP]
