New Jersey: Child Hospitalized After Encephalitis Infection
--------------------------------------------------
A 2-year-old Burlington County girl is undergoing treatment for
severe neurological damage after becoming the 1st person in New
Jersey to be infected with eastern equine encephalitis in nearly 20
years. The girl was hospitalized on 28 Aug 2003 after developing a
fever, seizures, and other symptoms 5 days earlier, state health
officials announced on Tue 21 Oct 2003. Doctors diagnosed her with
encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and later tests by the
Centers for Disease Control confirmed the infection was eastern
equine encephalitis, state Health and Senior Services Commissioner
Clifton R. Lacy said.
The victim is the 11th reported eastern equine encephalitis case in
the United States in 2003, but the 1st in New Jersey since 1984. "The
reappearance of eastern equine encephalitis infection in humans in
New Jersey, with its serious neurological consequences, serves a
powerful reminder of the importance of avoiding mosquito bites, even
late in the season," Lacy said.
Eastern equine encephalitis infections are rare but pose a
significantly higher risk of death than West Nile virus infection,
health officials said. About 35 percent of people infected die,
according to a CDC fact sheet. Symptoms range from flu-like illness,
to inflammation of the brain, coma, and death. About 35 percent of
those who survive subsequently experience mild to severe neurological
problems.
There is no licensed vaccine for the disease or effective drugs to
treat it, according to the CDC. People who spend time outdoors are
most likely to contract the disease. Those over age 50 or under 15
tend to be most at risk for severe infection. There have been about
200 confirmed cases nationwide since the disease was first diagnosed
in the United States in 1964. States with the largest number of cases
are Florida, Georgia, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.
