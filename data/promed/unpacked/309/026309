There have been no confirmed human cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD)
epidemic in the United Kingdom (UK), though 15 suspected human cases have
been reported since March [2001.
Our previous report on the outbreak concluded that it does not constitute a
risk to public health (1). Historically, human cases, where reported, have
been rare and resulted in mild, self-limiting illness (2-5). The symptoms
are non-specific, and most of those who become ill after exposure to animal
FMD will have other diagnoses.
Specimens from the 15 suspected cases reported to the Public Health
Laboratory Service (PHLS) Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC)
in London have been tested by the Virus Reference Division at the Central
Public Health Laboratory (CPHL). The tests included polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) assays for animal FMD virus. Patients or their medical
advisers have been informed of the results.
One specimen was positive for a human enterovirus, but none was positive
for the animal FMD infection. It is very unlikely that any of these cases
is human hand, foot and mouth disease, but serological tests are being
conducted to exclude the possibility.
News reports are creating considerable anxiety among some members of the
public, especially where animal foot and mouth disease is prevalent. There
continues to be confusion between animal foot and mouth and the common
human viral infection "hand, foot, and mouth disease", which is caused by a
completely different human enterovirus (6).
Healthcare staff advising worried patients should bear in mind animal FMD
is extremely unlikely to affect humans, and first consider other diagnoses.
A set of frequently asked questions and their answers is available on the
PHLS website:

The UK Departments of Health have issued further guidance on how to
minimize the risk to public health from the slaughter and disposal of
animal carcasses through rendering, incineration, burning, and burial:
