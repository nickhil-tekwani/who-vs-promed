INFLUENZA, EPIDEMIC PREPAREDNESS

For decades, U.S. and World Health Organization officials have warned that
an influenza pandemic rivaling one that killed more than 21 million people
worldwide in 1918 and 1919 could strike without warning.
Yet, according to this story, neither the U.S. government nor WHO has
approved final plans to counter a pandemic, even as they help the
government of Hong Kong deal with a worrisome outbreak of influenzavirus A
H5N1.
The government created a panel in 1993 to devise a plan to deal with an
influenza pandemic; the latest draft, written last week, is being sent to
Donna Shalala, the U.S. secretary of Health and Human Services. Approval
is expected quickly now that events in Hong Kong have heightened awareness,
government officials were cited as saying. But they acknowledged that the
Hong Kong outbreak had pointed up gaps in the draft, making further
revisions likely.
In the Hong Kong outbreak all cases have occurred sporadically, with no
known links between the patients, who range in age from 1 to 60. What most
mystifies health officials is why the bird flu strain [H5N1] appeared in
humans now and precisely how it is being transmitted to humans.
U.S. and WHO officials interviewed were cited as expressing confidence in
the thoroughness of their draft plans for a pandemic. But WHO refused to
release a copy of its draft. The American disease-control agency initially
denied repeated requests for a copy of the nation's draft plan, but Dr.
Peter Patriarca, an official of the Food and Drug Administration who is the
principal author of the American drafts, released it over the weekend.
According to the story, however, the draft does not explicitly cover
several situations that have arisen in the Hong Kong crisis. For instance,
elaborate safety precautions are needed because of A(H5N1)'s dangers to
humans and poultry. Thus, scientists working with the strain are allowed to
do so only in highly secure laboratories designed to deal with the
deadliest of viruses. But even though virtually all leading influenza
experts in this country contributed to the blueprint, none discussed the
need for high-security laboratories, Patriarca was cited as saying.
A lack of such laboratory sites has prevented the food and drug agency's
top influenza virologist, Dr. Roland Levandowski, from working on the strain.
