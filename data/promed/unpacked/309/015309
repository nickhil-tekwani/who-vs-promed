Narrator: Residents of 2 villages in the West Kazakhstan region are in confusion and panic. Cattle have been killed by an unknown disease; the veterinarians cannot reach an accurate diagnosis. Some of the villagers say they suspect foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Our correspondents went to find out if quarantine has been declared in the West.

(A farmer): Well, these horns have already started to peel off. That's when I suspected FMD.

Correspondent: It all started 2 weeks ago and looked like FMD, starting immediately after the inoculation of the vaccine. Symptoms in cattle were excessive salivation, ulcers all over the body, lameness, hoof horn peeled. The owners of cows immediately sounded the alarm and called upon their veterinarians, who could not say exactly what it was.

A resident of the village Chapaev WKR: All cattle became ill after this vaccination. Prior to that everything was normal: the cattle were grazing, everything was fine. Then they got sick and all. The only treatment was rinsing the mouth with potassium permanganate solution.

Sick cows were marked with paint and kept in separate pens, in order to prevent them from infecting others. Besides, the exhausted animals simply cannot return home. Veterinarians visit them every day.

Another resident of the village Chapaev WKR: Today the vets came, telling us that everything is fine -- normal. For drugs we have not enough money, in general. The drugs are expensive, 2500 for a single bottle.

Correspondent: During the last 2 weeks, 62 cows got sick, 13 calves died in the Akzhaiyk district. These figures were given by the vets. The villagers are outraged: they have several hundred sick animals, and can have more. The villagers are confused. After all, how to help the cows, nobody knows.

Well, they make the vaccine, but did not explain anything to us. There she lies, drool flowing from her. The treatment is done.

Correspondent: The 1st samples sent for FMD tests are not yet confirmed, while veterinarians still say to refrain from drinking the milk or consume the meat of the infected animals. Now they are waiting for the results of regular tests.

Maktagali Nuraliev, head of the veterinary department of the Akzhaiyk district: The quarantine has not been introduced by us, because the diagnosis is not confirmed. If not confirmed, we are unable to declare quarantine.

As you know, FMD is transmitted from animal to human quite simply -- by airborne droplets and by eating infected meat and dairy products. If an infectious disease in cows is confirmed, according to the law the villagers can expect to be compensated.

[A rather similar TV report, transmitted the same day with another correspondent (Zhanar Nizamutdinova) is available at http://www.ktk.kz/kz/news/video/2016/07/04/70591. Both sources include a video of the reported visit to the village Chapaev, presenting the interviews and several allegedly affected cows and calves.

In view of the contents of the above TV report(s), in particular the informed negative results of the FMD tests (though still pending confirmation by an international reference laboratory), the laymen-described "ulcers all over the body," and particularly in view of the recent report on the diagnosis of lumpy skin disease (LSD) in Mangyshlak (central-western region of Kazakhstan) (20160722.4363497) -- it seems likely that the June 2016 event covered in the above TV report, which was suspected by farmers as FMD, was, in fact, an earlier outbreak of the said disease, closer to the border with infected Russian territories.

According to the interviews with the residents of Chapaev (Chapayev) village, the event had started about 2 weeks prior to the date of the TV report (4 Jul 2016), namely about mid June. This falls in line with the information provided by the governor of the region, in his press conference of 16 Jul 2016 (see 20160722.4362368). Adil Zholamanov said: "On [17 Jun 2016], 10-15 sick cattle were reported in one day in Chapayev village of the Neftebaza district. ... Samples for pathology testing were sent to the regional veterinary laboratory ... and to Astana. ... The results did not confirm FMD or pasteurellosis." And further: "movement was restricted, and prevention measures such as cattle vaccination undertaken."

It may thus be assumed, while awaiting official confirmation, that LSD has been circulating in Western Kazakhstan at least since mid June 2016, probably introduced from the infected, neighbouring Russian territories Astrakhan and/or Volgograd, spreading from West Kazakhstan southwards to Mangyshlak, a distance of several hundred kilometers. Infected animals -- and the virus -- may have reached, by now, other regions in Kazakhstan, since -- as reported in the above TV program -- "quarantine could not be declared/introduced because the diagnosis (of FMD ...) was not confirmed."

Interestingly, villagers in Chapaev (Chapayev) disclosed that the disease "started after the inoculation of the vaccine." In this respect it should be stressed that the LSD virus may spread iatrogenically by the repeated use of vaccinators' needles.

In case the mentioned inoculation involved an FMD vaccine, this may have impact upon the country's zonal FMD-free status (West Kazakhstan is included in the zone declared free without vaccination).

Animal health issues, including the prevention of FMD entering Kazakhstan ("from Iran and Iraq through Kirgizia") and the certification of internationally traded animals/products, were negotiated recently between the Russian Rosselkhoznadzor and representatives of the Committee for Veterinary Control and Surveillance of the Ministry of Agriculture of Kazakhstan Republic (a meeting dated 15 Jun 2916; see http://www.fsvps.ru/fsvps/events/17429.html?_language=en). - Mod.AS
