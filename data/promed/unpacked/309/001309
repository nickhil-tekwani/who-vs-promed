Curungrejo Village, Kecamatan Kepanjen, Kabupaten Malang, East Java
was declared an Extra Ordinary Incident due to a chikungunya
outbreak, after 26 local residents came down with the illness.

The health service carried out fogging/fumigation. Fumigation was
done to kill chikungunya [virus] vector mosquitoes, the service head
of the Kesehatan Regional Government, Malang, East Java, Muhammad
Fauzi, said on Sunday [25 Nov 2007].

Apart from the Kepanjen Subdistrict, he continued, in the Malang
Regency, 2 other subdistricts, Gondanglegi and Kalipare, had serious
chikungunya virus outbreaks.

In 2006, 100 residents of 2 subdistricts had chikungunya virus infections.

Inhabitants in the settlements of the Gondanglegi subdistrict and
Kalipare are located close to the reservoir, the potential centre of
the mosquitoes' breeding, he stressed.

[If the reservoir referred to in this report is a water reservoir, it
is less likely to serve as a breeding site for _Aedes_ chikungunya
virus vector mosquitoes than household water receptacles would be.
