----------------------------------------------
A beef estancia in the partido (county) which had had an anthrax
outbreak last January [2010] has had a recurrence. The herd consists
of 70 Aberdeen Angus which had been vaccinated following the previous
outbreak. Their veterinary was called to see an animal with obvious
respitratory signs, but which died minutes before he arrived. On
necropsy it had pneumonia, patechia, mediastinal lymphadenitis and a
generalised haemorrhage. Suspecting it was anthrax the veterinarian
sent a metatarsal bone to the diagnostic laboratory for confirmation.

The laboratory recovered a pure culture of _Bacillus anthracis_
sensitive to the following antibiotics -- Penicilina,
Tetracycline,-Ampiciline, Ciprofloxacine, Tilmicocine, Gentamicine,
Florfenicol -- and resistant to Trimetroprime. No other person was
involved in handling the carcass, which was disposed of using the
standard Control Tarp procedure. [The carcass is covered in lime and
then by a thick plastic tarpaulin which is pegged down. After 9
months the bones are collected and buried or burnt. - Mod.MHJ]

Since 2004 the Partido of Azul has been registered as an Alert and
Response Zone for any outbreak of anthrax, whether natural,
accidental or deliberate. To date 68 outbreaks of bovine anthrax have
been reported since 2004.

[As we mentioned in a previous posting the Argentine Pampas have a
history of subeffective vaccinations. Frequently the owners have to
vaccinate their beef stock 3 or 4 times to get adequate protection.
The cause of this evades clarification. In spite of this the annual
rate is falling each year and the disease is essentially sporadic
with minimal cases, as in this instance with a single death. However
we should remember that the Southern Hemisphere is presently coming
into Spring and warmer weather.
