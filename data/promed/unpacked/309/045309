[It should be noted that many diseases may in some circumstances produce
hemorrhagic symptoms, e.g. leptospirosis, staphylococcal & streptococcal
infections, meningococcemia & other bacterial diseases, in addition to the
viral hemorrhagic fevers such as yellow fever, Ebola, Lassa, Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever, Rift Valley fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever & others.
The soldiers could have been suffering from any of these. In addition,
other reports say they were nowhere near the outbreak area in the
Congo. - Mod.JW
