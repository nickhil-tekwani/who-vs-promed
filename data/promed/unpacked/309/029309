An emerging tick-borne bacterium in Europe, Asia, and Africa poses a risk for immunocompromised patients, causing an illness that could be mistaken for an underlying disease, according to a study published yesterday [18 Mar 2014] in Clinical Infectious Diseases [1].

The bacterium, widespread in ticks, rats, mice, and voles, was discovered in Japan in 2004 and was first recognized as a human pathogen in 2010, says the report by a European team. It is called _Candidatus_ Neoehrlichia mikurensis, with the 1st term signifying that no one has reported cultivating it as yet.

The authors gathered data on 11 European patients with hematologic malignances or autoimmune diseases in whom the infection was diagnosed from 2010 to 2013. The patients were mostly older men (median age, 67); all but one had ongoing or recent immunosuppressive treatment, and 8 of 11 had undergone splenectomy, the report says. Less than half of them recalled tick exposure.

The most frequent symptoms were fever (in 11 of 11), pain in muscles and/or joints (8 of 11), vascular and thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis (6 of 11), transitory ischemic attacks (2), pulmonary embolism (1), and arterial aneurysm (1).

The median time from 1st symptoms to correct diagnosis was 2 months. In at least 4 cases, the condition was attributed to the underlying disease, and immunosuppressive therapy was scheduled. All the patients recovered with doxycycline treatment.

The authors conclude that _Candidatus_ Neoehrlichia mikurensis is "an emerging tick-borne pathogen that may give rise to a systemic inflammatory syndrome in persons with hematologic or autoimmune diseases that could be mistaken for recurrence of the underlying disease and/or unrelated arteriosclerotic vascular events. Awareness of this new pathogen is warranted among rheumatologists, hematologists, oncologists, and infectious disease specialists."

Abstract
--------
Background: _Candidatus_ Neoehrlichia mikurensis is a newly discovered non-cultivatable bacterium spread among ticks and rodents in Europe and Asia that can infect humans, particularly immunocompromised patients.

Methods: We compiled clinical and laboratory data from 11 patients with hematological malignances or autoimmune diseases who were diagnosed with _Candidatus_ Neoehrlichia mikurensis infection in Europe 2010-2013. Both published (6) and unpublished cases (5) were included.

Results: The patients had a median age of 67, were mostly male (8/11), and resided in Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, and the Czech Republic. All but one had ongoing or recent immune suppressive treatment and a majority were splenectomized (8/11). Less than half of them recalled tick exposure. The most frequent symptoms were fever (11/11), localized pain afflicting muscles and/or joints (8/11), vascular and thromboembolic events (6/11), that is, deep vein thrombosis (4), transitory ischemic attacks (2), pulmonary embolism (1), and arterial aneurysm (1). Typical laboratory findings were elevated C-reactive protein, leukocytosis with neutrophilia, and anemia. Median time from onset of symptoms to correct diagnosis was 2 months. In at least 4 cases, the condition was interpreted to be due to the underlying disease and immunosuppressive therapy was scheduled. All patients recovered completely when doxycycline was administered.

Conclusion: _Candidatus_ Neoehrlichia mikurensis is an emerging tick-borne pathogen that may give rise to a systemic inflammatory syndrome in persons with hematologic or autoimmune diseases that could be mistaken for recurrence of the underlying disease and/or unrelated arteriosclerotic vascular events. Awareness of this new pathogen is warranted among rheumatologists, hematologists, oncologists, and infectious disease specialists.]

[The following is extracted from the moderator ML's comments in a prior ProMED-mail post Anaplasmosis-like illness - Europe: new tick-borne pathogen 20111028.3207:

"_Anaplasmataceae_ is a family of Gram negative, obligate intracellular alphaproteobacteria that consists of 6 genetically distinct genera: 1) _Ehrlichia_, _Anaplasma_, and _Neorickettsia_; 2) _Wolbachia_ and _Aegyptianella_, which only infect nematodes, arthropods, or birds; and 3) the newly proposed genus _Candidatus Neoehrlichia_ (http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/reprint/48/7/2630). _Candidatus_ is the term used for an interim taxonomic status of noncultivable prokaryotic organisms. 'Neoehrlichia' refers to a new _Ehrlichia_; 'mikurensis' refers to Mikura Island in southern Japan, where the organism was discovered (http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/54/5/1837.long).

"_Candidatus_ Neoehrlichia mikurensis recently was discovered in ticks and wild rodents in East Asia (Japan, China, Russia) and Europe (Sweden, Italy, Netherlands, Germany) (http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/full/48/7/2630). A closely related but distinct species, _Candidatus_ N. lotoris, was found in raccoons in North America (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16428872). Experimental infection with _Candidatus_ Neoehrlichia mikurensis in rats did not elicit antibodies against _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_ and _Ehrlichia muris_ antigens (http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/content/54/5/1837.long), which further support the position that _Candidatus_ Neoehrlichia is a separate genus.

"_Candidatus_ N. mikurensis has been identified by PCR amplification of its 16S rRNA gene in at least 4 humans in Europe with febrile illnesses that was associated with thrombotic or hemorrhagic events. Several of the infected patients have been immunocompromised (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20220155, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20519481, and
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21353949)." - Mod.ML
