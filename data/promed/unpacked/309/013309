Anthrax has been confirmed on a 5th property in north west Victoria bringing to 25 the number of confirmed sheep deaths to the disease [yesterday's report "Anthrax - Australia (07): (VI) ovine, new outbreak 20170403.4944930" had 28 cases. - Mod.MHJ]. The Swan Hill farm has ties to the other farms with confirmed sheep losses from anthrax last month [March 2017].

Victoria's Chief Veterinary Officer Charles Milne said nearly 6000 sheep had now been vaccinated against the bacteria in the region. He said the most recent sheep to die had been vaccinated and he expects many will need to have a 2nd dose of vaccine.

Mr. Milne said he was confident the anthrax did not spread to the 5th property after quarantine measures were in place and suspects it had been present in the soil for quite some time. Anthrax can linger in soil. "This is almost certainly a longstanding transmission, it may not even have been this year [2017]," he said. "The spores of these bacteria can last a long time in the soil, decades. Actually ascertaining exactly how the spread occurred is going to be challenging."

"We're up to almost 6000 sheep that have been vaccinated to-date and the developments following these latest infected premises mean there is another 700 to go over the next few days. We're currently investigating all the movements of sheep, machinery and any other possible sources of contamination to try to identify how these bacteria have been passing between these premises."

[The timing and content of this report suggests that it might (note "might") be in response to some points raised yesterday. The interesting piece of news, other than confirming that it was a sheep flock affected, was that this 5th affected flock suffered cases after vaccination. If the flock contained animals incubating disease, i.e. infected but still seemingly healthy, one would expect them to drop dead before their immune systems were able to kick in in response to the vaccine. Also working the flock to get it vaccinated is stressful for the sheep and this could have either accelerated an infection or converted a subclinical infection into something far more serious.

This is why when one is vaccinating animals at risk of having been exposed you should check their temperatures as you do it. With experience your hand is perfectly adequate for this. Any animal with an apparent temperature should be given long acting antibiotics and marked so it can be revaccinated in 10 days time. Sterne is a live vaccine and antibiotics will kill the germinating cells, at least the quickest to germinate.

When I was in Brazil in the mid-70s working on FMD I was introduced to the post-infected chronic hypothyroid survivors, "peludas" or "Asoleadas". They were easy to pick out. You just went down the line of cows in the dairy barn and laid your hand on each rump. Cool. Cool. Cool. Warm! I will overcome the temptation to discuss these interesting animals but just make the point that even ignoring all other signs one could identify them just with your hand. This should be the same with any animal running a temperature. - Mod.MHJ
