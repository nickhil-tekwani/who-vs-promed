---------
The Minister of Agriculture announced the confirmation of African swine fever (ASF) outbreak in North Sumatra Province on 12 Dec 2019. Since late September [2019], increased pig mortality [has] been reported in North Sumatra and some other provinces. FAO is liaising with the Directorate General of Livestock and Animal Health Services. The Director of Animal Health requested FAO to provide recommendations on containment and control of ASF in the event that the disease is confirmed as present in the country. The FAO team is drafting recommendations on ASF control, appropriate to conditions in Indonesia.

At the time this posting is being drafted, the due official notification of this listed disease to the OIE, with epidemiological information and mode of diagnosis, has not yet become available.
