Indonesia: Route of Transmission of Infection to Family in Jakarta Unresolved
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indonesia's search for the source of the avian influenza virus that
killed 3 people near its densely populated capital, Jakarta, has
ended in failure, the Health Minister said on Wednesday [10 Aug
2005]. Health experts said they could not pinpoint the source and
decided to end the investigation into how a man and his 2 young
daughters contracted avian H5N1 influenza virus infection last month
[July 2005]. They were the country's 1st human casualties of the
virus. "After lengthy research, we've decided to cease the
investigation," Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari told reporters.
"With our knowledge and research, we have tried very hard to link the
deaths of the family with every possibility." Experts had said
locating the source of the infection would be key to preventing
further deaths. But in the world's 4th most populous country, a
sprawling archipelago dotted with small farms where even many urban
families keep chickens, pinpointing the source was always going to be
difficult. Supari said there were no fresh human cases reported,
after authorities tested more than 300 people who had contact with
the family. She also said tests on several people, including a news
photographer, who had been under close observation for avian
influenza, were negative.
"The Ministry will increase alertness through surveillance,
monitoring and technical preparedness at hospitals and ports," said
Supari. Indonesia has prepared 44 hospitals across the country for
the treatment of possible outbreaks [of avian influenza in human
patients].
A lack of funds to compensate farmers has seen Indonesia vaccinate
healthy animals in affected areas rather than use mass culling, a
method recommended by the World Health Organization. In Indonesia,
the virus has spread to 21 provinces out of 33 since late 2003,
killing around 9.5 million fowl. The virus jumped species into pigs
in Indonesia on the densely populated island of Java earlier this
year [2005]. Health experts say pigs can carry human influenza
viruses, which can combine [i.e. exchange homologous genome sub-units
by genetic reassortment. - Mod.CP] with the avian virus, swap genes
and mutate into a form which can pass easily among humans. In an
effort to help the industry, the government has launched a campaign
to raise awareness that poultry is safe to eat if cooked properly.
Avian influenza recently killed another person in Viet Nam, taking
the number of deaths in Asia to 62. Outbreaks in wildfowl and poultry
have also been recorded in Russia and Kazakhstan since mid-July 2005,
sparking fears of a worldwide pandemic. It was confirmed on Wednesday
[10 Aug 2005] that the virus was the deadly H5N1 serotype.

[The circumstances surrounding the exposure and deaths of 3 members
of one family residing in an affluent suburb of Jakarta, who appear
to have had no contact with the rural population, remain unresolved.
Pet birds maintained in an adjacent house and more than 300 human
contacts have all tested negative for avian influenza virus. The only
previous case of human infection in Indonesia was an asymptomatic
poultry worker identified in a screening program several months ago.
Most human cases of avian influenza elsewhere in East Asia have been
attributed to consumption of diseased poultry. It may be that the
deceased members of the Indonesian family had contracted the
infection from inadequately cooked poultry products. Since
person-to-person transmission has not been unequivocally confirmed in
other outbreaks in East Asia, it must be presumed that the father and
his 2 daughters, but not other members of the family, consumed
contaminated food. However, no evidence confirming this supposition
has come to light, and, possibly, some other previously unrecognized
route of transmission remains to be discovered. It is unfortunate
that the Indonesian health authorities have decided to abandon the
quest. - Mod.CP]
