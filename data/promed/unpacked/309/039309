38 Typhoid Cases in Hospital out of 328
---------------------------------------
"38 patients are still under medical observation out of the 328 typhoid
cases declared in Batna province," Health Minister, Mourad Redjimi said
Mon, 30 Aug 2004. Alongside the visit he paid to a number of medical
structures in west Algiers, Redjimi indicated that the concerned services
have filled in more than 100 wells and stopped 16 suspected drinking water
supply points, at the origin of typhoid spread," imputing this "to the
nonrespect of the fundamental health guidelines and the exploitation, by
the population, of wells without proceeding beforehand to their analyses."
"In spite of the typhoid cases declared this year in El-Eulma, Bechar and
Btna, a decline of 26 percent of this disease was registered," Redjimi
observed. The Minister however, affirmed that other cases can appear in the
few days to come, saying the incubation period in this disease can last
between 15 and 30 days.
"In order to counter this situation, the concerned services are tirelessly
working to supply the population with clean drinking water using
appropriate tanks while renewing the suspected water pipes," the Minister
explained. Minister Redjimi announced recently that epidemiological
indicators revealed "a clear improvement" of the epidemiological situation
as regards transmissible diseases compared to previous years.
