[A subscriber poses again the following question which has been formulated
in different ways in recent ProMED-mail posts. It provides an appropriate
lead-in to the article reproduced from CIDRAP News in the following
section. - Mod.CP]
Has there been an antibody population screen in areas of avian influenza
outbreaks to ascertain how many people have been exposed with little or no
clinical disease? A 75 percent kill rate is scary and seems a bit high.

Questions raised about Viet Nam's avian influenza reports and testing
-----------------------------------------------
Viet Nam, the country at the center of this year's [2005] avian influenza
activity, may have 2 problems with its data on human cases: transparency in
reporting and accuracy in testing. The country has lapsed in its reporting
of cases to the World Health Organization (WHO). More than a month passed
without official reporting of cases, despite widespread media reports of
several new cases, according to a story by the Canadian Press (CP) on 1 Mar
2005.
Ongoing monitoring by CIDRAP News [CIDRAP is the Center for Infectious
Disease Research & Policy, Academic Health Center, University of Minnesota.
- Mod.CP] also shows substantial discrepancies between official and
unofficial numbers. Because the WHO relies on official reports for its case
counts and as the basis for advice to member countries, the lack of
reporting has an impact, Dr. Klaus Stohr, director of the WHO's global
influenza program, told the CP. "The situation is that WHO has a request by
its member states to provide proper risk assessment, to help other member
states of the WHO . . . in assessing what's going on in Asia and [to]
provide advice to other member states. And without this information, this
is very difficult," Stohr said. WHO officials had requested reports in
person and in writing, the CP story noted. Those efforts appeared to be
paying off on 2 Mar 2005, when Dick Thompson, communications officer in the
Communicable Diseases Section of WHO in Geneva, told CIDRAP News by e-mail:
"We understand that there is some movement, and we will have an update
shortly." Viet Nam is not the only country with reporting shortcomings.
Indonesian farmers tallied more than 33 000 poultry deaths from avian flu
during the past 2 months, the Jakarta Post reported today [Fri 4 Mar 2005].
Indonesia has not reported any new outbreaks to the World Organization for
Animal Health (OIE) in several months.
Reporting can trigger difficult consequences. "Many countries find it
difficult to report outbreaks of contagious diseases. These can impact
trade and tourism, or it can injure their international standing or
self-image," Thompson wrote. The pattern of cases in Viet Nam has not
changed recently. Thompson commented, "the press reports suggest that the
missing cases are sporadic. This would be a serious public health issue if
there were a cluster of cases, that is, not 15 isolated cases ranging over
several weeks, but a single cluster of 15 cases from one area among casual
contacts and health care workers. That doesn't seem to be the case in Viet
Nam." He criticized developed nations: "These are nations which can afford
to help countries like Viet Nam. Right now, these Asian countries are
sustaining enormous hits to their economies in the effort to fight [avian]
flu. If they are successful, every nation will benefit by not having to
confront a pandemic. Therefore, we believe that those nations which share
the benefits of this fight should . . . help [poorer] countries which are
largely managing on their own."
Reporting issues aside, Viet Nam may face another hurdle in coping with
avian flu: re-analysis of samples showed that some Vietnamese, who had
flu-like symptoms but tested negative for H5N1 virus in Viet Nam, actually
had the virus. The findings, which cast doubt on the sensitivity of Viet
Nam's H5N1 test, were described in a 24 Feb 2005 news story in Nature.
According to the story, samples from 11 recent avian flu case-patients in
Viet Nam, as well as samples from 90 patients who had suspected cases but
tested negative for H5N1 virus, were sent to the National Institute of
Infectious Diseases in Tokyo. About 1/3 of the samples had been tested
there so far. Of those, 7 that had tested negative in Viet Nam were found
to be positive, said Phan Van Tu, head of the microbiology and immunology
department at the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City. Re-testing in Viet
Nam then confirmed 4 of the 7 positive results. Tu said one reason for the
discrepancy was that reagents in the original tests weren't mixed well and
yielded unclear results. He added that the institute would use the more
sensitive test that was used in Tokyo and improve technician training,
according to the story.
