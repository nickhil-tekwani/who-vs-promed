Last week [week ending 21 Sep 2014], a horse tested positive for rabies in Randall County [Texas], resulting in post-exposure treatment for a number of individuals. As a result, local and state health officials remind all animal owners to keep their pets and livestock up-to-date on rabies vaccination.

"Yearly rabies vaccination for animals is important," says Dr. Roger Smalligan, Health Authority for Potter and Randall counties. "This will help protect our pets, livestock and ourselves from rabies."

People should also avoid skunks, raccoons and bats as they are common carriers of rabies. It is important that animals and pets be vaccinated as they can come into contact with rabid animals, posing a risk to humans.

"We discourage handling sick or injured kittens or puppies that spend time outside," says Casie Stoughton BSN, RN, CPH, Director of Public Health. "If you encounter any survivors of litters that appear to have been attacked by skunks, please contact the proper authorities. Feral cats can also be at risk for rabies disease and transmission."

Early identification and assessment of animal bites are critical to evaluate for the need of post-exposure prophylaxis. Therefore, all animal bites must be reported to the appropriate animal control entity:
Those in the local Amarillo and Randall County area include:
- City of Amarillo: Animal Management & Welfare
- City of Canyon: Canyon Police Department
- Potter County: Sheriff's Department
- Randall County: Sheriff's Department

[This article illustrates what this moderator has been saying for years: vaccinate all the animals you have contact with, including your horses, and especially your show calves. Farm animals can and do get rabies and can be quite dangerous to humans.

Building a barrier between you and rabies can be done by vaccinating your pets, regardless of their size, from the smallest dog to the largest horse or bull or cow. That range includes goats and sheep and any other mammals in your sphere of animal contacts.

Rabies is fatal to all animals. Save yourself or your family members the heartache of losing your pet or your investment in an expensive horse or cow: vaccinate them for rabies. You may save yourself or your loved one from death.
