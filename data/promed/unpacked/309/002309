A man in China has died after contracting a rare infectious disease from primates, known as the monkey B virus, Chinese health officials revealed in a report Saturday [17 JUL 2021]. The victim, a 53-year-old veterinarian based in Beijing, was the 1st documented human case of the virus in China.

According to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the man worked in a research institute that specialized in nonhuman primate breeding and dissected 2 dead monkeys in March [2021]. He experienced nausea, vomiting, and fever a month later, and died [27 May 2021]. His blood and saliva samples were sent to the center in April, where researchers found evidence of the monkey B virus. Officials said that 2 of his close contacts, a male doctor and a female nurse, tested negative for the virus.

The monkey B virus, or herpes B virus, is prevalent among macaque monkeys, but extremely rare -- and often deadly -- when it spreads to humans. In humans, it tends to attack the central nervous system and cause inflammation to the brain, leading to a loss of consciousness, said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease expert at Kobe University in Tokyo. If untreated, there's about an 80 percent fatality rate.

There have been fewer than 100 reported human infections of herpes B since the 1st case of primate-to-human transmission in 1932, many of them in North America, where scientists tend to be more aware of the disease, Iwata said. There are likely to be cases of the virus that have gone undetected, but experts still widely believe that it is an extremely rare condition among humans.

Victims have tended to be veterinarians, scientists, or researchers who work directly with primates and could be exposed to their bodily fluids through scratches, bites, or dissections. In 1997, a primate researcher in New York died 6 weeks after a caged monkey flung a drop of liquid at her face, hitting her eye. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there has only been one documented case of an infected human spreading the virus to another person.

Both herpes B and the novel coronavirus are "the consequence of species jumps," said Nikolaus Osterrieder, dean of the Jockey Club College of Veterinary Medicine and Life Sciences in Hong Kong. "But the important difference is that in the case from herpes B, it's a dead end. It's not jumping from one human to another human," he added. "SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, acquired the ability to spread to a new host."

Osterrieder said herpes B is very well-adapted to macaque monkeys and unlikely to mutate in a way that it will start to spread rapidly among humans. Nonetheless, both he and Iwata emphasized that they hope more people learn about the disease and take the right safety precautions, especially when interacting with monkeys in non-research settings, such as at a zoo or in nature. Officials in Florida debated last year [2020] what to do over a rapidly multiplying population of rhesus monkeys -- an emerging tourist attraction -- many of which carried the herpes B virus.

Chinese health authorities said discovery of the monkey B virus in a human suggests that it might "pose a potential zoonotic threat to occupational workers," adding that it's necessary "to strengthen surveillance in laboratory macaques and occupational workers." By Monday [19 Jul 2021], news of the veterinarian's death had been viewed more than 110 million times on the Chinese social media platform Weibo.

"Apart from researchers, most people should stay away from wild animals," said one post with several thousand likes. "You may want to be close to nature, but nature doesn't want to be close to you."

[This is the 1st case of human infection of herpes B virus in China. See the China CDC Weekly report:
Wang W, Qi W, Liu J, et al. First human infection case of monkey B virus identified in China, 2021. China CDC Weekly 2021; http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/doi/10.46234/ccdcw2021.154

Monkey B virus is an alphaherpesvirus commonly found among macaques -- a genus (_Macaca_) of Old World monkeys that serve as the natural host. The virus is found among rhesus macaques, pig-tailed macaques, and cynomolgus monkeys (also called crab-eating or long-tailed macaques). Although the virus can infect humans, fortunately, there have been few human cases of infection by this virus but unfortunately, the above report adds another human fatality.

The USA CDC recommends treatment for the following situations:
- "Skin or mucosal exposure -- with or without injury -- to a high-risk source (such as a macaque that is ill, immunocompromised, known to be shedding virus, or has lesions compatible with B virus infection.)
- Inadequately cleansed skin exposure (where the skin is broken) or mucosal exposure (with or without injury).
- Laceration of the head, neck, or torso.
- Deep puncture bite.
- Needle stick associated with tissue or fluid from the nervous system, lesions suspicious for B virus, eyelids, or mucosa.
- Puncture or laceration with objects (a) contaminated either with fluid from monkey oral or genital lesions or with nervous system tissues or (b) known to contain B virus.
- A culture taken after the wound was cleansed tests positive for B virus.

"Prophylaxis for exposure to B virus
- Valacyclovir: 1g by mouth every 8 hours for 14 days, or
- Acyclovir: 800 mg by mouth 5 times daily for 14 days

"Treatment of B virus infection
"With no CNS symptoms
- Acyclovir: 12.5-15 mg/kg intravenously every 8 hours, or
- Ganciclovir: 5 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours

"With CNS symptoms
- Ganciclovir: 5 mg/kg intravenously every 12 hours. Prophylaxes for exposure to B virus has been shown to effectively protect rabbits from lethal infectious doses of B virus, but no comparable studies of efficacy in humans have been possible.

"For more detailed information, refer to the Recommendations for prevention of and therapy for exposure to B virus (_Cercopithecine herpesvirus_ 1; https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/35/10/1191/296729), published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2002.

"Most patients with CNS complications will die, even with antiviral therapy and supportive care, and those who survive usually suffer serious long-term neurologic problems. Respiratory failure associated with ascending paralysis is the most common cause of death. Respiratory involvement and death can occur 1 day to 3 weeks after symptom onset."
