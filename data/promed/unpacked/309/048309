Anthrax Outbreak Kills 600 Animals
----------------------------------
Over 600 wild animals have died of anthrax in Masvingo Province over
the past 2 weeks amid fears that the outbreak is spreading across the
province.
Dr Welbourne Madzima of the Department of Veterinary Services
confirmed an outbreak of anthrax in the province but said the disease
was now under control.
"More than 600 wild animals have died in the past weeks, mainly
kudus, and our department in Save and Bikita has visited the affected
areas, so everything is now under control," Madzima said. [This
probably refers to prevention of outbreaks in domestic animals; what
steps have been undertaken to prevent additional cases in kudus?! -

The department, he said, had enough vaccines for the disease. "We do
have enough vaccine in the country. Actually we were expecting a
consignment yesterday from South Africa to add to our stock," he
added.
Anthrax is caused by bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, whose spores can
survive in an environment for years. Experts say the disease spreads
quickly during the dry season as livestock and wildlife graze closer
to the ground and ingest pathogens in the soil.
Vultures and other carrion-feeding birds can transmit the disease
over huge distances.
The outbreak of the disease comes when the tourism industry in
Zimbabwe is on the verge of collapse, and experts say this could
hinder the recovery of the industry.
