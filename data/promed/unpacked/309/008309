India: Outbreak of Jaundice in Kerala
-------------------------------------
Cases of jaundice [hepatitis is frequently referred to as jaundice in the
Indian press - Mod.MPP] have been reported in many parts of the state, with
10 persons succumbing to the disease in the past few months. Kottayam
district reported the highest number of cases, including 10 deaths. The
Medical College there has treated more than 500 jaundice patients. Jaundice
cases have also been reported from Thrissur, Pathanamthitta and
Alappuzha districts.
According to Additional Director (Public Health) Dr M.K. Jeevan,
contaminated water bodies are the main source for the spread of the
disease. If a contaminated water tank in the Medical College had been the
source in Kottayam, polluted local ponds were the cause in Thrissur and
Alappuzha districts. According to Dr Jeevan, the mushrooming of eating
places must be checked, as [their sources of water are unknown].
According to sources in the Kerala Government Medical College Teachers'
Association, 90 house surgeons, 165 medical students, and around 100 people
in Kottayam have contracted the disease in the last 6 months. The condition
of 6 doctors became critical and 2 of them died.

[Outbreaks of water-borne hepatitis in India have been associated
predominantly with sewage-contamination of water supplies. 2
hepatitis-associated viruses -- hepatitis A virus (a picornavirus) and
hepatitis E virus (an unrelated enteric virus) -- have been responsible for
water-borne outbreaks of jaundice. Hepatitis E virus is the more
threatening, as women in the latter stages of pregnancy are at greater risk
of serious disease. Hepatitis A virus infection resolves without
complication and protection can be achieved by vaccination. The number of
fatalities, particularly among medical personnel, suggests that hepatitis E
virus may be the culprit, because doctors and hospital staff might be
expected to have received hepatitis A vaccination. Further information from
the region would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
