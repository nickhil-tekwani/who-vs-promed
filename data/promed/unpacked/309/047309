Australia: Nursing home patients receive treatment for virus disease
-----------------------------------------------
Patients and staff at a Canberra nursing home have been given an anti-viral
treatment to prevent the further spread of a respiratory illness.
Australian Capital Territory Health has confirmed there have now been 5
deaths at Narrabundah's Jindalee Nursing Home and that a further 52 people
are battling the illness.
The outbreak is believed to have started early last month [October 2006].
At this stage, the disease is confined to staff and patients at the one
nursing home.

[The serious illness affecting patients and staff at a nursing home in
Canberra is being treated now as an outbreak of viral infection, but the
identity of the agent responsible has not been disclosed. The patients and
staff are receiving unspecified antiviral treatment, which presumably
implies restricted use of antibiotics and reliance on antiviral compounds.
Likely candidates for etiologic agent are influenza virus (susceptible to
oseltamivir or amantidine/rimantidine) or respiratory syncytial virus
(susceptible to ribavirin or palivizumab), both highly infectious agents
frequently associated with outbreaks of viral diseases among the elderly in
care homes. - Mod.CP]
