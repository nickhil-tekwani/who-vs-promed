A total of 3 birds tested positive for the H5N8 virus in Co Galway this week [week of 19 Feb 2017], the Department of Agriculture has reported.

The wild whooper swans were found at Clondroon Lake in Milltown, Co Galway, the Department said on [Fri 24 Feb 2017]. This brings to 12 the number of wild birds diagnosed with the highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza in the Republic so far. With one Northern Irish case detected in a wild swan in Co Derry earlier this month [February 2017], all provinces on the island have now been infected since Christmas.

In Britain, the UK's chief veterinary officer confirmed a H5N8 case in a small flock of chickens at a farm near Haltwhistle, Northumberland, also on [Fri 24 Feb 2017]. The 25 chickens either died or were culled.

Restrictions including the obligation to keep all farmed birds indoors or at least completely segregated from wild birds remain in place in the Republic and in the UK. However, authorities in Britain have said they would allow free-range flocks outdoors again in low-risk areas from [Tue 28 Feb 2017]. Northern Ireland and the Republic are currently reviewing their own rules.

St Patrick's Day [Fri 17 Mar 2017] presents a milestone for free-range producers, who will lose the precious label if they remain prohibited from letting their birds out past the 12 weeks elapsed since restrictions came into force on 23 December [2016].

[HPAI H5N8 continues to occur throughout Europe. This virus has infected poultry, wild and captive birds in several countries, causing immense losses to the poultry industry. H5N8 HPAI virus appeared in Great Britain in December 2016, and then in Ireland, and it is still actively circulating in the region.

Some recent studies suggest that wild waterfowl and domestic ducks are important in the emergence and maintenance of HPAI H5N8. - Mod.PMB
