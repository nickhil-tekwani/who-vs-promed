The National Health Security Office of foodstuffs (ONSSA) announced on Saturday [31 Oct 2015] that a foot and mouth disease [FMD] outbreak in cattle was detected in a farm located in Douar Lmouarid in the rural commune Bouhmame, province of Sidi Bennour.

"As part of an FMD surveillance program, laboratory investigations carried out last Thursday [29 Oct 2015] on diseased cattle from a farm located in Douar Lmouarid, Bouhmame village, in Sidi Bennour province, have confirmed the presence of FMD," says ONSSA in a statement.

To limit the spread of the disease to other farms, control measures were immediately taken and implemented by the provincial veterinary service of Sidi Bennour in collaboration with local authorities, at the level of the farm where the disease has been declared. These consist of surveillance operations and the prohibition of entry or exit of animals susceptible to the disease and their products (milk, meat, etc), slaughter and destruction on site of infected animals, enforcement of strict sanitary measures for persons entering and leaving the FMD outbreak, and application of biosecurity measures (installation of footbaths, etc) in buildings and places housing susceptible animals. They have also been expanded to include cleaning and disinfection operations (premises and equipment, etc), the vaccination of cattle around the foci, and the launch of an epidemiological investigation in the area, adds the statement.

Moreover, a vigilance committee closely follows the evolution of the health situation of the animals, and all field workers were informed and sensitized to ensure close monitoring of the health status of the national herd, says ONSSA, recalling that a booster vaccination campaign is planned for early November 2015.

FMD is a viral animal disease not transmissible to humans; it is contagious to susceptible species, including cattle. The virus responsible for the disease may be easily transported over large distances by air in temperate zones.

Since FMD appearance in Tunisia on 29 Apr 2014, and in Algeria on 27 Jul 2014, Morocco has adopted a strategy based on a series of preventive measures including vaccination of the cattle population. To this end, 2 generalized vaccination campaigns were conducted in 2014 and 2015 and enabled the vaccination of about 2.7 million cattle head each year.

[The last outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in Morocco dates back to 2001. The country had been contaminated from Algeria, and, subsequently, systematic vaccination of susceptible animals had been introduced and applied until 2006, when the risk of resurgence of disease had become minimal.

Thus, Morocco remained free of FMD for more than 14 years. This favorable situation has been recognized by the World Organisation for Animal Health [OIE] which recently granted the country the status of a country whose control program is recognized.

Following the outbreak that hit Tunisia in [April 2014] and Algeria in [July 2014], Morocco resorted to systematic vaccination of cattle in response to the risk of disease introduction and strengthened its system for epidemiological vigilance. The country managed to preserve its livestock from contamination originating from Algeria during a period of 15 months.

However, FMD has occurred this time in an area that is about 800 km [about 500 miles] from the Algerian border. The virus responsible for the Sidi Bennour outbreak has not yet been serotyped. It could be a serotype introduced from a source other than Algeria, but it is more likely to be the Algerian virus. In the latter case, an upstream investigation must be conducted to find, at least along the major roads, possible FMD outbreaks which have possibly occurred in cattle and small ruminants.

Information related to the immune status [vaccination history] of the animals found sick and the results of serotyping of the virus strain circulating in Morocco would be appreciated.

Sidi Bennour is the capital of the eponymous province that is part of the sub-region Doukkala, in Casablanca-Settat region. The city is located 74 km [46 miles] of El Jadida and 174 km [106 miles] of Casablanca (http://www.provincesidibennour.ma/). The province of Sidi Bennour is a province with a farming vocation, and it is home to a number of farms raising mainly cattle of improved breeds. - Mod.AB]

[The identification of FMD serotype SAT-2 in Mauritania, a country bordering Morocco on its south, in December 2014 (reported in May 2015, no new cases observed since February 2015) deserves to be kept in mind as well. - Mod.AS
