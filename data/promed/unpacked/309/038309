["Scrapie is a neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats. So called 'atypical' scrapie is clinically, pathologically, biochemically and epidemiologically unrelated to 'classical' scrapie, is likely to be non-contagious and a spontaneous degenerative condition of older sheep and rarely of goats. This chapter describes tests for both conditions so that they may be differentiated.

"Classical scrapie is characterized by vacuolar changes in the central nervous system (CNS). It has been recognized as a clinical disorder for more than 250 years, and is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), or prion disease, as defined by the accumulation of an abnormal form of a host membrane glycoprotein (prion protein or PrP) referred to as PrPSc, in the CNS. In animals of some genotypes, PrPSc accumulation is also detectable in lymphoreticular tissues. Polymorphisms of the PrP gene are associated with susceptibility to scrapie. Breeding for resistance has been used as a tool in the control of ovine classical scrapie, but no genotype appears to be completely resistant to infection.

"The more recently identified condition known as atypical scrapie has some clinical and pathological features similar to classical scrapie but is not considered to be transmitted in field situations. The epidemiology is consistent with a condition that occurs sporadically. Consequently, surveillance for classical scrapie will detect occasional cases of atypical scrapie. It has been reported in sheep with PrP genotypes that are relatively resistant to classical scrapie.

"Classical scrapie is endemic in many countries, where it has often been introduced by importation. Australia and New Zealand have maintained freedom from classical scrapie through strict restrictions on imports and other measures. Classical scrapie may be transmitted from dam to offspring in the period from parturition to weaning, and potentially in utero. It can also be transmitted horizontally to unrelated sheep or goats. The infectious material can persist on pastures and in buildings. Fetal membranes are a source of infection, and milk from clinically affected animals can transmit disease. The incubation time between primary infection and clinical disease is usually longer than 1 year and may sometimes exceed the commercial lifespan of the animal. The majority of cases occur between 2 and 5 years of age. Clinical disease develops only if the agent enters the CNS. Atypical scrapie, where it presents clinically, is reported mostly in older animals, and occurs with a geographical distribution suggestive of a spontaneous disease, although it has been transmitted experimentally".
