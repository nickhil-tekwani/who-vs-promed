At least 4 persons died of Japanese encephalitis (JE), while 22 others suffering from JE have been admitted at Jorhat Medical College and Hospital and other private medical centres within the past 72 hours, said sources from the office of the Joint Director of Health Services on Thursday [2 Aug 2018].

The 4 victims all hail from different areas of Jorhat like Dhekorgorah, Melang Bali Chapori, Mariani and Deberapara.

The District Malaria officials distributed DDT, bleaching powder and medicinal [insecticide treated] mosquito nets. A special 6-member team from the Malaria Department has been pressed into service for spraying medicines in Baghchung, Kuwari Pukhuri, Sadar Ali, Timtimia gaon, Maju gaon, Dhekiajuli, Jalukonibari, Thengal and Mariani.

[Assam state is endemic for Japanese encephalitis virus, with cases occurring every year. For example, recently, a 30 Jun 2018 report indicated that the number of encephalitis cases in the Dibrugarh district of Assam state had increased in this area in Assam state to 105. Of these, 30 were confirmed to have JE and 75 with AES of unspecified etiology.

There is no mention of AES in the above report. It is odd that no mention is made of JE vaccination in the report above, which would be more effective at preventing JE cases than fogging of residences or environmental spraying. The _Culex_ mosquitoes that transmit JE virus breed in extensive wetlands including rice paddies. Long-lasting insecticidal nets and insecticide-treated bed nets may also reduce numbers of JE virus vector mosquitoes in houses.
