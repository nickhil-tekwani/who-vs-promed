[2] Cholera - Zimbabwe

Zimbabwe's cholera epidemic has broken all African records and WHO predicts
100 000 people may be infected before it is contained. When cholera 1st
started spreading last year [2008] the worst-case projections were that 60
000 people could fall ill. That total has already been surpassed, with well
over 3000 dead.

While the cholera epidemic in Harare, the capital, has stabilized, in other
more rural locations, cholera is raging. The International Federation of
the Red Cross has deployed a large number of emergency response units in
Zimbabwe, but neither it nor other humanitarian agencies can cope with the
spread of cholera. WHO recently found that in a 2 week period in Midlands
province infections quadrupled from 1000 to 4000, while deaths rose from
100 to 400.

Matthew Cochrane, the IFRC's spokesman, travelled across Zimbabwe last week
[2-6 Feb 2009] and said that in Kwekwe, a mining town 100 miles west of
Harare, the Imbizo clinic, which had no resources, was overrun with
patients after admitting 130 in 3 days.

A total of 51 people have died from cholera in South Africa over the past 3
months, MPs heard on Wednesday [4 Feb 2009]. Presenting the latest figures
on the cholera epidemic, health department communicable diseases manager
Frew Benson told Parliament's water affairs portfolio committee there have
been a total of 8100 cases in the country since October-November 2008.

Most of these, 4165 cases, had been in Mpumalanga, the province with the
most deaths, 30. Second was Limpopo, with 3680 cases and 20 deaths. There
had also been 234 cases in Gauteng, with 3 deaths. Less affected provinces
were Western Cape (9 cases, 1 death), North West (7 cases), KwaZulu-Natal
(2 cases, 1 death), Eastern Cape (1 case), Free State (1 case) and Northern
Cape (1 case).

The figures for some other countries in the region cover the period from
October or November 2008 up to mid-January 2009. While South Africa has
been the worst affected, Mozambique, which has reported 3333 cases and 46
deaths, is not far behind. Zimbabwe's northern neighbour, Zambia, has 2267
reported cases of the disease, with 28 deaths; Angola has reported 643
cases and 8 deaths; and Namibia 58 cases and 5 deaths. Botswana has
reported only 6 cases, and no deaths.

Another death has been recorded in Limpopo, bringing to 21 the total number
of deaths as a result of cholera in the province. The latest victim was a
26 year old man who died while receiving treatment at the Siloam Hospital
outside Thohoyandou.

Spokesman for the provincial department of health and social development,
Phuti Seloba, said yesterday [8 Feb 2009] 63 new cholera cases were
recorded at the weekend. This, he said, indicated a decline in new cases
recorded on a daily basis. But the total number of cases that had been seen
has exceeded the 4000 mark since the outbreak of the disease on 15 Nov 2008.

Seloba said there were 11 new cases in Vhembe, 28 in Capricorn, 11 in
Sekhukhune, 4 in Mopani and 9 in the Waterberg districts.

The Eastern Regional Health Directorate recorded about 88 cholera cases
from 10 Dec 2008 to 4 Jan 2009. The affected communities include Mamfe,
Amonokrom, Akropong Akwapim North District. Mamfe recorded the highest
number with 70 cases. The deputy eastern regional director in charge of
public health, Dr George Bonsu attributed the problem to lack of good
drinking water and poor environmental sanitation.

Dr Bonsu advised the public to cook food thoroughly in treated water and
eat while it is hot. They should also wash their hands thoroughly with soap
after defecation and before preparing or eating food. Dr Bonsu also
entreated the public to wash vegetables and fruits in treated water before
consumption. According to him anybody who suffers from severe watery
diarrhoea should quickly report to the nearest health center for medical
treatment.

More than 50 have been killed by an outbreak of cholera in Malawi which has
affected more than 1800 people, the health ministry said on Thursday [5 Feb
2009].

The death toll has moved from 14 in Jan 2009 to 52 now, Chris Kango'mbe, a
senior official in the health ministry said in a report. He said that 39 of
the deaths occured in 2 shantytowns of the administrative capital Lilongwe
due to "perennial water shortages and poor sanitation in city townships."

Since the outbreak of cholera in Zimbabwe, Botswana has so far recorded 10
cases. A 41 year old man recently died at Tsolamosese Clinic in
Mogoditshane after showing cholera symptoms. According to the Director of
Public Health, Ms Shenaaz El Halabi, investigations are ongoing to
determine if the actual cause of death was cholera.

Ms Halabi said all the victims in the recorded cases are from Zimbabwe and
because they were reported in different places, chances are that the
disease could be all over the country. She advised people to follow strict
hygienic measures to prevent the disease at all costs.
