A second fox carrying rabies has been found in western Newfoundland, after
the first case of rabies on the Northern Peninsula since 1989 was confirmed
early this month [December 2002]. Residents of Newfoundland's west coast are
being advised to vaccinate their pets against rabies and avoid wild animals
that are acting strangely.
