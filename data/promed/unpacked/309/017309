Leishmaniasis outbreak in parts of Balochistan and Sindh
--------------------------------------------------------
An outbreak of leishmaniasis, a skin disease caused by the bite of a sand
fly, has been reported in parts of the southern Pakistani provinces of
Sindh and Balochistan. "The number of cases reported to health authorities
has gone up from 402 to more than 1200 in just 2 days. And we are receiving
similar reports from the adjoining districts of Sukkur, Jacobabad, Larkana
and Naushero Feroze," said Dr Hadi Bux Jatoi, director-general (DG) of
health services in Sindh. He was talking to IRIN from Sukkur district, some
480 km from the Sindh capital, Karachi, on Friday [7 Jan 2005].
Leishmaniasis is endemic in the provinces of Balochistan, North West
Frontier Province (NWFP) and Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FA-TA).
It was reported in Sindh for the 1st time in 2000 and since then the cases
have been mounting, according to health officials.
Dr Jatoi said that 4 mobile health teams had been deployed in Dadu. "During
the last season [2004], some 4000 cases were reported across the province,
but this year [2005], it is spreading [even more] rapidly." 7 districts of
Balochistan -- those of Qilla Sai-fullah, Loralai, Zhob, Barkhan, Musa
Khel, Ziarat and Quetta -- have been reported as having a high prevalence
of leishmaniasis.
"We've had reports from the health authorities of these districts about the
occurrence of cases, and they've been asked to submit the [detailed] data
so that we can plan effective interventions," Dr Sher Ahmed, a WHO medical
officer in the Balochistan capital, Quetta, told IRIN. He said that WHO had
been trying to introduce weekly reporting on the actual incidence of the
disease as part of the Disease Early Warning System. "For that, the WHO has
trained the medical staff at the primary, secondary and tertiary level
health facilities," Ahmed added. Leishmaniasis, a skin disease, is caused
by the bite of a sand fly. A pimple appears on the skin after the bite,
which grows with time, becomes very ugly, and persists for a long time.
"Sometimes, the period lasts as long as a year... It is called "Saldana" in
Afghanistan and Iran, where it is widely prevalent," Dr Faizullah Kakar,
epidemiologist at the WHO country branch, told IRIN in the Pakistani
capital, Islamabad.
The DG health services, Sindh has proposed aerial spraying against the sand
fly in areas of Sindh and Balochistan to contain the disease. "If it
continues to occur, then we'd need huge resources to treat the patients
every year, which is practically impossible. So, we must address the root
cause of the disease, that is to eliminate the sand fly," Dr Jatoi said.
Nevertheless, WHO officials have stressed the need to focus on a prevention
and control strategy, rejecting the idea of aerial spraying. "Spraying
won't work. Practically it's not possible on such a large scale, as it
would involve a huge cost. Secondly, it's not a permanent solution, as the
situation would be the same again after 2 months," Dr Ghulam Nabi Qazi, WHO
provincial operational officer for Sindh, told IRIN from Karachi. "We need
to focus on effective interventions, such as community awareness, proper
health education, personal hygiene, and improving the disease monitoring
system," Ahmed said. Another reason the idea of spraying wouldn't work is
that there are continuous migrations of the sand fly from Afghanistan,
where its prevalence is far higher, so the host and vector would always be
present, the WHO medical officer said.
However, the health authorities in Sindh maintain that community awareness
for preventive care won't work in the areas, "where the majority is
illiterate, and the area has been severely hit by drought over the years;
where people have no [clean] water to drink; so how can they be trained in
personal hygiene?" asked Dr. Jatoi. "The district of Dadu alone is 300
miles [500 km] long, and the population is scattered, so it's not possible
to run community awareness programs in the area," he added. The DG for
health said the root cause of the disease needed to be focused on, and for
that, technical assistance should be sought. "The treatment of the disease
is costly, unbearable for the poor masses. At the moment, we are dealing
with the situation, but if the cases continue to grow like this, then what
will happen?" he wondered.

[The outbreak in Sindh was reported by ProMED-mail in 2004 (see references
below) and thoroughly discussed by Dr Philippe Desjeux -- Medical Officer
Disease Control, Prevention and Eradication (CDS/CPE) TDR Leishmaniasis
Research Coordinator -- in our posting from 1 Feb 2004. In brief, all cases
are cutaneous with a probable animal reservoir in small rodents. The sand
fly vector breeds outside, and the outbreak is due either to increased
human or to rodent migration. The discussion of different control
strategies favored by the Pakistani authorities and the WHO is interesting
but, with the background data provided, it seems that spraying is an
expensive and short term measure which will not eliminate the vector for
long and will not affect the zoonotic reservoir. - Mod.EP
I think it is generally agreed that in most cases, compulsory treatment of
those infected with _Leishmania major_ (ZCL) is the best strategy to
control outbreaks. However, if the vector proves to be _Phlebotomus
papatasi_ (see 20040201.0392), then it may be appropriate to spray the
internal surfaces of houses and outhouses with residual insecticides. In
fact, spraying was believed to have greatly reduced leishmaniasis in India
when used to kill the indoor-resting anopheline vectors of malaria.
However, such an approach will not kill sandfly adults resting outside
homes, such as in rodent borrows. Although it might be argued that aerial
spraying is more appropriate, this approach has rarely (if ever) been
successful in controlling sandfly populations; even when used against
mosquito vectors of malaria and dengue, aerial spraying has often failed.
Moreover, it requires considerable organization and high costs, which most
would consider totally unjustified, especially as the actual sandfly vector
and their habits (such as resting places) have not actually been
identified. Furthermore, outdoor spraying does not usually remain effective
for more than 2 to 3 months.
I would be surprised if there were "continuous migration" of sandflies from
Afghanistan into the Sindh or other areas of Pakistan, as suggested in the
report. Although they have been known to fly up to 2.2 km over a few days
and might be dispersed considerable distances with the wind, sandflies
generally fly very short distances. Nevertheless, I would think that human
population movements, such as migration of labour forces and/or changes in
rodent populations are more likely to have aided the reported increases in
leishmaniasis. - Mod.MS]
