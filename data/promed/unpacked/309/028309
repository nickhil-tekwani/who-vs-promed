A hospital in south China's Guangdong Province is under investigation
over the bacterial infection of 18 women who had Caesarean sections
there last year [2009]. The women gave birth at the Huaqiao Hospital,
the largest hospital in Gurao Town of Shantou City, from August to
November [2009], an official with the provincial health department
said on condition of anonymity.

"We received reports of several bacterial infection cases in October
[2009] and ordered the local health authority to launch an overhaul
of the hospital," he said. But the public knew little of the scandal
until the Southern Daily, a Guangzhou-based newspaper, carried a
lengthy report on Monday [24 Jan 2010]. The report said at least 7 of
the cases had been covered up, which the provincial health department
official confirmed with Xinhua Tuesday [25 Jan 2010]. "We were aware
of only 11 cases," he said. "We sent an investigation team to Shantou
on Monday and will keep the public informed of the result." The
hospital had been told to suspend Caesarean sections, he added.

Laboratory tests found patients were all infected with nontuberculous
mycobacteria, or NTM, the same cause of a massive post-surgery
infection in 1998 that affected 166 patients at a maternity and
child-care hospital in Shenzhen.

One of the 7 patients whose conditions were concealed was a woman
whose wound has been purulent since she had a Caesarean section at
Huaqiao Hospital on 31 Aug 2009. "I was told it was an immunity
problem and received antibiotic treatment for months," she was quoted
as saying in the newspaper. Until Monday [24 Jan 2010], she and 6
other patients were being treated at the hospital for up to 7 hours daily.

Several other patients were told that their wounds had not healed
either because they were too skinny or too fat, the newspaper
reported. Huaqiao Hospital was founded in 1995 with donations from
overseas Chinese. It provides medical services to more than 300 000
people in town.

[The species of non-tuberculous mycobacteria involved in the
nosocomial outbreak in China is not specified in the news release
above. The non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (a grouping outside of
the _M. tuberculosis_ complex) are usually classified on the basis of
in vitro growth rate, colonial pigmentation and rapid molecular
diagnostics. Non-pigmented, rapidly growing mycobacteria species
(RGM) produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of
incubation and include the _M. fortuitum_ complex and the _M.
chelonae-abscessus_ group. Pigmented, intermediately growing NTM
require 7-10 days to produce mature growth on agar plates and include
_M. marinum_ and _M. gordonae_. Slowly growing NTM, which require
more than 7-10 days to produce mature growth on agar plates, include
_M. kansasii_ and the _M. avium/intracellulare_ complex. RGM commonly
cause skin and subcutaneous infections, which can be either
community-acquired or nosocomial.

_M. fortuitum_ causes community-acquired skin and soft tissue
infection, usually following trauma in previously healthy individuals
and has followed exposure to contaminated footbaths in nail salons
(see Sniezek PJ, et al. Arch Dermatol 2003; 139: 629-34; available at
<http://archderm.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/139/5/629>). _M.
fortuitum_ is found in natural and processed water, as well as in
sewage and dirt, worldwide.

Nosocomial outbreaks of infections due to RGM are generally related
to subcutaneous injection or wound contamination with non-sterile
water or implanted devices (for example, see Padoveze MC, Fortaleza
CM, Freire MP, et al. Outbreak of surgical infection caused by
non-tuberculous mycobacteria in breast implants in Brazil. J Hosp
Infect 2007; 67: 161-7; abstract available at
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17881086?dopt=AbstractPlus>).
Also, nosocomial RGM infection has followed use of contaminated skin
markers in cosmetic plastic surgery (Safranek TJ, et al.
_Mycobacterium chelonae_ wound infections after plastic surgery
employing contaminated gentian violet skin-marking solution. N Engl J
Med 1987; 317: 197-201; abstract available at
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/4/197>).

Shantou is a city of almost 5 million people in coastal Eastern
Guangdong Province, China. A map showing the provinces of China can
