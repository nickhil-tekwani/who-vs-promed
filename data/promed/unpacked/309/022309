Undiagnosed disease kills at least 15 in one week
-------------------------------------------------
According to local sources on Friday [25 Jun 2010], since the beginning of
this week [20 Jun 2010], some 20 cases and at least 15 deaths of an
unidentified disease have been reported in Songo, which is located 12 km
[7.5 mi] from Basankusu, the main town in the district of Equateur,
Equateur province, Democratic Republic of Congo. Sources from the Equateur
health district in Basankusu indicated that the disease is manifested by
fever, headache, abdominal cramps, and vomiting, without additional comment
for reasons of confidentiality.

Currently, the hospital in Songo is treating 6 cases, 2 of whom are
children under 10 years of age. Other cases have sought refuge in local
churches believing that cause of the illness is witchcraft because of the
rapidity of death of the victims. Boniface Awenze, the Equateur District
commissioner stated, however, that medical teams had been dispatched to the
area to investigate the situation. "We are adopting 2 approaches. The 1st
is a legal approach to investigate the allegations of witchcraft, and the
2nd is to mobilize a medical team comprising the area medical officer and
the nurses in the area already treating the patients to carry out the
medical investigation and determine whether it is an epidemic." He added
that until the investigation has been completed, people should observe the
advice of the medical team now deployed in the field in order to prevent
the spread of the disease to other localities.

[Further information from the area would be appreciated. The description of
the illness does not allow a diagnosis, but suggests that it is not an
outbreak of the hemorrhagic fevers which have afflicted this region in the
past.
