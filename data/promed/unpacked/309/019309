Agriculture experts and growers say they've never seen so many pecans, but
all the rain may contribute to crop disease. Heavy rains produced such a
large crop of pecans this summer [2007] that the nuts are falling out of
trees in record numbers, agricultural experts and growers said Friday [19
Oct 2007]. Officials say picking the nuts off the ground is no problem, but
they discourage people from climbing trees or knocking them off branches.

Growers agree that this year's [2007] pecan crop is impressive. "I can't
remember a year when there were this many pecans on the trees," said former
Williamson County Judge John Doerfler, who has been raising pecans near
Georgetown as a hobby for almost 30 years.

The only drawback to the rains that helped generate this fall's [2007]
harvest is that the humidity bred a disease known as scab, which causes
pecans to turn black and fall off branches. "That sustained dampness
occurred during June and July [2007]," Williamson County Extension agent
Zan Matthies said Friday [19 Oct 2007]. "I haven't seen any actual figures
yet, but I'd be interested in knowing how badly diseases like scab affected
this year's crop."

[Pecan scab, caused by the fungus _Cladosporium caryigenum_, is generally
the most damaging pecan disease. Discovered on pecans in 1888, it started
to become a problem in the early 1900s, when farmers 1st domesticated the
crop in North America. Scab attacks the foliage, twigs, and developing
fruit. The fungus overwinters on leaf petioles and stems infected the
previous season. In the spring, spores are produced, which are spread
locally by rain and dew and by wind and infected plant material over longer
distances. The disease causes lesions on leaves and immature fruit. Severe
infection causes defoliation, fruit abortions, and poorly filled fruit,
thus reducing yields. The pathogen is active throughout the growing season
and, if left unchecked, can cause near total crop losses.

Pecan varieties vary greatly in their susceptibility to scab. A number of
resistant pecan varieties are available, but many grafted varieties are
susceptible. Most commercial varieties were at one time resistant, but
resistance has broken down due to adaptation by the pathogen. The disease
can cause problems for the primary commercial pecan varieties in regions
with a moist climate. It is not a problem in arid regions. Its damage to
the pecan industry in the USA is estimated at over USD 20 million each year
in losses and control costs. The disease is managed by fungicide applications.

The name "scab" is descriptive of the symptoms. A number of diseases with
this name exist on a range of different crop hosts. However, these diseases
may be caused by a variety of different fungi or bacteria, and the
pathogens are not necessarily related.
