Avian influenza: situation in Egypt
-----------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Population of Egypt has announced a new
human case of avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. The case is a
16-year-old female from Assuit Governorate, Upper Egypt whose
symptoms began on 8 Dec 2008. She was initially hospitalized at the
district hospital on 11 Dec 2008 and then transferred to the Assuit
University Hospital on 13 Dec 2008 where she died on 15 Dec 2008.

Infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus was diagnosed by PCR
[polymerase chain reaction] at the Egyptian Central Public Health
Laboratory and subsequently confirmed by the US Naval Medical
Research Unit No. 3 (NAMRU-3) laboratories on 15 Dec 2008.

Investigations into the source of her infection indicate a recent
history of contact with sick and dead poultry.

Of the 51 cases confirmed to date in Egypt, 23 have been fatal.
