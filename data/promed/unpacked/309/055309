[The following has been excerpted from the OIE Terrestrial Manual, Chapter 3.7.11 Scrapie, at https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.07.11_SCRAPIE.pdf:

Scrapie is a neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats.... Classical scrapie (also known as la tremblante; Traberkrankheit; Gnubberkrankheit; Prurigo lumbar) is a naturally occurring progressive, fatal, infectious, neurodegenerative disease of sheep and goats that has been recognised for at least 250 years, and has been reported in Europe, North America, Asia and Africa. There is no evidence of a causal link between classical or atypical scrapie and human transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs).
