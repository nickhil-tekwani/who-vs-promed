The existence of a non-pathogenic strain of the virus causing bird
flu has been confirmed in the state according to knowledgeable
sources. Officials only said that no pathogenic strain of the virus
has been detected yet but were [close-mouthed] about the presence of a
non-pathogenic strain.
However, the arrival of officials of the Union Ministry of Veterinary
and Animal Husbandry following the testing of some samples of blood
of chickens that died in an unknown epidemic recently in and around
Imphal at the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory, Bhopal raised
suspicion of something serious. [For Imphal, capital of the state of
Manipur, northeast India, see map at
<http://www.indtravel.com/graphic20/indpoli1.gif>].
Surveillance of more blood samples of chickens have also intensified
ever since and continued throughout the day today [Tue 17 Jul 2007].
Although the strain found in dead chickens in Imphal recently is not
the pathogenic variety, knowledgeable sources said it only takes time
for the virus to mutate to become pathogenic, hence the need for
extreme precautions.
Surveillance and serum sample collection to test and confirm the
geographical spread of the bird flu virus in the state has been
intensified in Manipur, even as authorities here said that "there is
no confirmed report of an outbreak of Pathogenic Avian Influenza (bird
flu) in the state." They, however, were guarded about the detection of
the non-pathogenic strain of the virus. The surveillance acquired
urgency following reports of deaths of chickens and other animals
[presumably other poultry - Mod.JW] in various farms in the state.
In the previous week [also], serum samples collected from various
places were sent to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory,
Bhopal for detection of avian influenza. The samples were collected
from places in the state where there were reports of deaths of
chickens and other farm animals that could have been caused by avian
virus, the source said.
The 1st sample was sent on 11 Jul 2007, while the 2nd sample was sent
Monday [16 Jul 2007], and the results of both are yet to be received
by the state authorities.
Director Dr Th Dorendra Singh of the state veterinary department, in a
brief with IFP, said the surveillance and sample collection, which has
been concentrated in a 5-km radius around Imphal in the last few days,
will be expanded to 15 km and beyond. He appealed to the people to
report any unusual deaths of chickens, birds and other domestic
animals [poultry].
"If there is a confirmed report of an outbreak of Pathogenic Avian
Influenza (bird flu) in the state, the state government as well as
the Central government will do everything necessary without a
moment's delay to have the epidemic declared by the Union government,
the director said.
Since the reports of the outbreak of bird flu cases in neighboring
Myanmar have been received in March this year [2007], the state
veterinary and forestry departments have taken up special
precautionary measures to prevent any possibility of the disease
spreading into Manipur. A report of an outbreak of Pathogenic Avian
Influenza (bird flu) at a farm located in Mayangone sub-district,
Yangon (West) district, in Rangoon province [Myanmar] was received on
28 Feb 2007.
