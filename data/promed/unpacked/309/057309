An outbreak of mumps restrict visits at the Modelo prison in Bogota
-------------------------------------------------------------------
As the result of an outbreak of mumps which has affected 56 inmates,
visits by children, pregnant women and seniors have been restricted.
Those affected are in isolation to prevent spread of the virus. The
1st signs of viral infection were detected among prisoners in cells
located in in the north of the prison, in bays 1A and 1B.

In addition to restriction on visitors, the transfer of prisoners to
other parts of the country has been suspended for the duration of the
outbreak.

The Supreme Judicial Council has been asked to suspend admissions of
prisoners to this jail until the infection has been eliminated and
normalcy restored.

[Humans are the only known host of the mumps virus. Spread is from
person to person, and occurs by airborne or droplet transmission.
Exposed persons should be considered infectious from 12 to 25 days
after exposure. The mean incubation period is 19 days with a range of
14-25 days. It is likely therefore that the Modelo prion in Bogota
will be closed to visitors for some time to come.

The most common and characteristic clinical presentation of mumps is
an acute and tender parotid swelling which develops 16-18 days after
exposure in up to 70 percent of cases. Mumps may present as a lower
respiratory tract infection, and asymptomatic and subclinical mumps
virus infections are common and may represent up to 20 percent of all
infections. Serious complications, including encephalitis, may precede
or follow the parotitis and can also occur without any apparent
involvement of the salivary glands. Encephalitis is a rare but serious
complication that affects 0.02-0.3 percent of cases and it is
responsible for most of the mumps associated deaths. Orchitis occurs
in 25-50 percent of mumps infections in post pubertal men. In about 30
percent of cases the orchitis is bilateral and may lead to
oligospermia, subfertility and decreased testosterone production but
only rarely sterility.

Immunisation is the only effective method of prevention. The large
number of prisoners affected in the outbreak in the Modelo prison
indicates that many young adults in Colombia have not been recipients
of the MMR (mumps, measles and rubella) vaccine. Furthermore
mathematical modelling indicate that 85-90 percent immunisation
coverage in a population is required to achieve herd immunity and the
elimination of mumps transmission.

La Modelo is a prison in Bogota, Colombia, which has a population of
about 11 000 inmates. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map of
