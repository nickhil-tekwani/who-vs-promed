Re: Dead birds don't migrate/ Avian influenza - Asia (10): migratory birds
-----------------------------------------------
Perhaps the dead ducks came into contact with asymptomatic ducks shedding
the virus while migrating north. These birds may have had little resistance
to the virus, because they normally reside and migrate in non-endemic
areas. This would mean the resistant, migratory ones are still at large.
Are there any known migratory routes that may intersect in such a fashion
in the Qinghai province area?

While dead birds may not migrate, epidemics don't infect all group members
simultaneously. When a pathogen is encountered by a group of individuals,
you would expect a logarithmic curve of numbers of individuals coming down
with the infection. So it would not be so unusual for a flock of migrating
birds to carry an infection some distance, losing a few members along the
way. The infection merely need peak at the location the dead birds were
discovered.
Certainly, bird transport by humans needs to be investigated, especially
since it may be a place where the disease gates might be shut. But I don't
think the fact that dead birds don't migrate rules out disease being
carried long distances by succumbing organisms.

Cockfighting is widely practiced in Kazakhstan, as elsewhere in Central
Asia, and there is a particularly relevant regional variation on
cockfighting that involves pitting freshly captured wild songbirds against
each other, who are often held by threads while they fight and may then be
released once one emerges dominant.
Wild bird fights often occur in the same pits as cockfights, so if you have
infected gamecocks, wild bird fighting offers a quick avenue for potential
transmission to wild birds at large.

[The above contributions, reflecting the complexity of the issue, are
appreciated. Being rather theoretical/hypothetical, they leave our initial
request for solid data on the detection of pathogenic H5N1 virus strains in
clinically unaffected (thus infected subclinically) feral birds,
un-responded to. - Mod.AS]
