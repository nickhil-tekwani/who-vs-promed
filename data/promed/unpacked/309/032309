From: "David J. Sencer" <djud@mindspring.com>

On 12 June 1996 Bob Shope corrected my statement regarding attempts to
isolate influenza virus in Alaskan natives. It was not his father that made
the attempt but three people from his father's alma mater, Iowa State
University. The quotation from Crosby's _Epidemic and Peace_ follows:
"In 1951 scientists attempted a direct assault on the mystery of Spanish flu.
In June, Albert McKee, Johan Hultin and Jack Layton -- scientists from
Shope's alma mater, the State University of Iowa -- flew to Fairbanks, where
they joined Otto Geist, a paleobiologist from the University of Alaska, and
continued on to Teller Mission on the bleak coast of the Seward Penisula.
Teller had lost about half its population in the 1918 pandemic, and those
victims had rested for 33 years undisturbed and perfectly preserved in the
permafrost of the Arctic, along with the microlife that had killed them.
The four scientists opened several graves, excising tissue specimens from
the lungs and smaller samples from the kidneys, spleens and brains.
"What the four scientists were trying to to do -- find and then revive the
deadly virus of 1918 -- was not so much ghoulish as Faustian, and they were
careful to draw about themselves and the cadavers all the pentagrams of
modern aseptic procedure. They did their own digging, permitting no one at
the grave sites but themselves, sterilized their instruments and gloves, and
wore surgical masks -- an incongruous sight in the vacuum of the tundra.
They sealed the tissue in metal containers packed in CO2 snow.
"Back at the State University of Iowa they managed to revive some of the
Pfeiffer's bacilli and pneumococci, but the virus of Spanish influenza,
despite all the techniques of resuscitation utilized, stayed dead -- dead as
a doornail and lacking in wise advice for the living. The most direct
assault on Spanish influenza had failed."
