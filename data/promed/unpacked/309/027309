[Clearly we are going to see more of these transient infections in
swine herds and other animal populations such as turkeys, domestic
animals and maybe even exotic species. As these occurrence become more
commonplace, we may have a chance to answer what it is about this
particular human to animal interface that allows transmission. It
clearly can occur anywhere around the world as the list of countries
where this has happened in swine now includes a pandemic type range of
countries including Canada, Argentina, Australia, Singapore, United
Kingdom, Ireland, Norway, Japan, Iceland, USA, Taiwan, Indonesia,
Finland and now Italy -- see references below. People, especially farm
workers but also pet owners, are simultaneously infected with pandemic
H1N1 in large numbers across all these and other countries, so the
question remains, why are these human to animal ocurrences successful
crossings of the zoonotic bridge and why now? - Mod.PC]
