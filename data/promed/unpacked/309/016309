The Public Health Agency of Canada is working with provincial and
local health authorities and the USA Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) to investigate a potential North American
gastrointestinal outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Poona.

In Canada to date, there have been 26 cases spread across British
Columbia (1), Manitoba (1), Quebec (8), Ontario (14), and Nova Scotia
(2) with the same genetic fingerprint.

The cause of the potential outbreak is not known at this time.
Provincial laboratories and the Agency's National Microbiology
Laboratory are conducting ongoing analyses to determine if other _S._
Poona cases share the same genetic fingerprint as those identified
thus far. The number of cases associated with this outbreak may
increase as the investigation continues.

[As the newswire above in the 1st section mentioned a possible link
to an outbreak ongoing in the USA, a retrospective newswire search
found the article below that appeared on 29 Sep 2008 giving the
number of cases in the USA that were being investigated as
potentially linked to this outbreak, although the distribution of
cases by state was not provided. - Mod.MPP]

Canadian health officials are investigating a potential North
American outbreak of a rare strain of salmonella called _Salmonella_
Poona. The Public Health Agency says it is working closely with local
and USA health authorities to determine the origin of the food-borne
illness that has sickened 48 people in the USA.

"We don't yet know the source of the outbreak. (The investigation) is
very preliminary right now," said Philippe Brideau, with the Public
Health Agency.

"It's a relatively rare strain around the world but it seems that
people just get sick and move on," he said, adding that there is an
average of 20 cases a year in Canada of the particular strain.

[We await more information regarding the source of this outbreak. - Mod.LL]

[Information on the distribution of cases in the United States and
the suspected vehicle for infection are not provided in the above
newswires. In 1991, there was an outbreak of salmonellosis due to
_salmonella poona_ with cases in the USA and Canada. The vehicle for
that outbreak was traced to cantaloupe from the Rio Grande Valley in
Texas, USA although the possibility of importation from Mexico was
raised in an MMWR article describing that outbreak
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00014966.htm>). There was
another outbreak of _salmonella poona_ associated with cantaloupe
imported from Mexico, again with cases in the United States and
Canada that occurred in 2002 (see prior ProMED-mail postings on this
outbreak -- Salmonella poona, cantaloupes - USA, Canada (02) 20021123.5884 and
Salmonella poona, cantaloupes - USA, Canada: recall 20020512.4181)

More information on results of investigations from knowledgeable
sources would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
