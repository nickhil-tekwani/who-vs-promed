Additional deer test positive for Chronic Easting Disease in
Hampshire County, WV
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preliminary test results indicate the Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD)
agent was present in 5 hunter-harvested deer collected in Hampshire
County during the 2008 deer firearms hunting season.

"As part of our agency's ongoing and intensive CWD monitoring effort,
samples were collected from 1355 hunter-harvested deer brought to
game checking stations in Hampshire County and one station near the
southern Hampshire County line in Hardy County," noted Frank Jezioro,
director for the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (DNR).

The 5 CWD positive deer included one 4.5-year-old doe, 2 2.5-year-old
bucks, one 4.5-year-old buck and one 1.5-year-old buck. All 5 of the
latest positive deer were harvested within the Hampshire County CWD
Containment Area (i.e., that portion of Hampshire County located
North of U.S. Route 50). However, the CWD agent previously has been
detected outside the containment area but still within Hampshire
County. The area in Hampshire County appears to continue to expand as
one of the most recent infected deer was approximately 5 miles
northeast of any previous known infected deer location.

CWD has now been detected in a total of 37 deer in Hampshire County
(i.e., 2 road-killed deer -- one in 2005 and one in 2008 -- 4 deer
collected by the DNR in 2005, 5 deer collected by the DNR in 2006,
one hunter-harvest deer taken during the 2006 deer season, 3 deer
collected by the DNR in 2007, 6 hunter-harvested deer taken during
the 2007 deer season, 11 deer collected by the DNR in 2008, and 5
hunter-harvested deer taken during the 2008 deer season). The DNR
will continue to update management actions designed to control the
spread of this disease, prevent further introduction of the disease,
and possibly eliminate the disease from the state as information from
deer testing within West Virginia is gathered and scientists across
the country provide more information on how to combat CWD in
white-tailed deer.

Thus far the following disease management actions have been
implemented by the DNR within Hampshire County:
a. CWD testing efforts designed to determine the prevalence and
distribution of the disease.
b. Deer population management to reduce the risk of spreading the
disease from deer to deer by implementing appropriate antlerless deer
hunting regulations designed to increase hunter opportunity to
harvest female deer.
c. Establish reasonable, responsible and appropriate deer carcass
transport restrictions designed to lower the risk of moving the
disease to other locations.
d. Establish reasonable, responsible and appropriate regulations
relating to the feeding and baiting of deer within the affected area
to reduce the risk of spreading of the disease from deer to deer.

"Landowner and hunter cooperation throughout this entire CWD
monitoring and management effort in Hampshire County has been
fantastic," Jezioro noted. "As we strive to meet this wildlife
disease challenge and implement appropriate management strategies,
the continued support and involvement of landowners and hunters will
be essential. The DNR remains committed to keeping the public
informed and involved in these wildlife disease management actions."

"Our well trained and professional wildlife biologists, wildlife
managers and conservation officers are working diligently to
effectively address this wildlife disease threat, and we are
collaborating with nationally recognized wildlife disease experts at
the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study in Athens, GA,"
Jezioro said.
