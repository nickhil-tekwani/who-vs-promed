[These 5 outbreaks are closely located in the southern central
highland part of the country. The outbreak area is roughly 300
kilometers (186 mi) south of the capital Antananarivo, near the city
of Fianarantsoa
(see map at
<http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lage-Fianarantsoa-in-Madagaskar-dt.jpg>
and the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at
<http://healthmap.org/promed/en?g=1064890&v=-21.433,47.083,6>.)
This outbreak area is further south than previous outbreaks in either
ruminants or humans and it would be important to know if there are
human cases occurring in the same region. Such a geographical
"checkerboard pattern" with large gaps between outbreak regions was
noted by Jim Steele in the RVF outbreaks in Egypt in 1977. A map of
the exact farm location for the outbreaks in this new region is
provided by the OIE WAHID website referenced above.

The 1st major wave of this outbreak was initially reported in April
2008. A useful summary of the current situation and basic information
of RVF is presented by FAO's (UN Food and Agriculture Organisation)
EMPRES (Emergency Prevention System) at
<http://www.fao.org/docs/eims/upload//242253/EW_rvf_apr08.pdf>.
The CIGAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research)
center, ILRI (International Livestock Research Institute) has also
just put out a release indicating that climate models may indicate a
difficult upcoming period during the short rains in East Africa; see
<http://www.ilri.org/ILRIPubAware/ShowDetail.asp?CategoryID=TS&ProductReferenceNo=TS_081222_001>.

While it is helpful to have a report of the disease in cattle, it
would also be useful to know if there are any human cases in the
area. ProMED-mail would appreciate any information on the timing and
location of human cases around Fianarantsoa. Biologically, cases in
ruminants precede human cases but unfortunately vagaries in reporting
of disease outbreaks often means that the reverse occurs so that
humans are acting as sentinels for the disease in animals. In such
cases, widespread recognition of animal cases only happens once human
cases start occurring. It seems that a logical hypothesis is that as
the disease has jumped south from Antananarivo, the reporting in
animals has improved, and it is hoped that this will provide an early
warning for people in the area. Again, more definitive information on
the comparative geographic occurrence in animals and people would be
appreciated because it would provide useful assessment of the
prospects for control. Rift Valley Fever certainly argues for a "One
Medicine" approach in its epidemiologic assessment. - Mod.PC]
