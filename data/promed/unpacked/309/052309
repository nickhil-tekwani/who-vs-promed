Taiwan: Cases of Acute Enterovirus Infection on the Increase
---------------------------------------------------
7 cases of acute enterovirus infection have been reported in Taiwan so far
in 2004, all of them in central and southern Taiwan, an official of the
Department of Health said yesterday. Wu Ping-huei, from the Health
Department's Center for Disease Control, said that the 1st 6 cases occurred
in central Taiwan, while the latest one was in Tainan County in southern
Taiwan at the end of April -- a 4-year-old boy who suffered from fever,
ulcers at the corners of his mouth, and vomiting and rashes. He has since
recovered and has been released from hospital.

Wu said that compared with the same period of 2003, which saw 41 serious
enterovirus cases in Taiwan, the number so far in 2004 is low. The reason
that northern Taiwan has no enterovirus cases might be because this year
the weather has been cool so far. Tseng Shu-hui, Director of the Health
Department's Center for Disease Control branch in southern Taiwan, said
that health officials still don't know why the serious cases of enterovirus
infection converged in central Taiwan.

[The enterovirus responsible for this outbreak of acute disease is not
identified in the report, but it is presumed to be enterovirus 71, and that
these cases are indicative of the seasonal epidemic of hand, foot and mouth
disease expected in children in Taiwan at this time of year. Further
information and clarification would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
