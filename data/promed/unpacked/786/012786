Med Tech Accused In Hepatitis Outbreak
----------------------------------
A Georgia hospital is contacting patients who were treated by a traveling medical technician who worked there briefly and is accused of causing a hepatitis C outbreak in New Hampshire. David Kwiatkowski is being held on federal drug charges in New Hampshire, and authorities are trying to determine whether he spread the virus elsewhere. The 33-year-old is accused of stealing anesthetic drugs from the cardiac catheterization lab and contaminating syringes used on patients at Exeter Hospital [New Hampshire].

Houston Medical Center in Warner Robins says Kwiatkowski worked there between 26 Oct 2010 to 17 Mar 2011. CEO Cary Martin says fewer than 100 patients who needed a heart catheterization and were treated by Kwiatkowski, and the hospital is contacting them by mail. He says future developments may lead to expanded testing recommendations.
