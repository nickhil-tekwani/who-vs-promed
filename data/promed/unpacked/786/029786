A major tour operator has been criticized for continuing to send tourists
to a hotel suffering its second health scare in three years. 22 British
holiday makers staying at the Club Aguamar complex in Majorca have been
struck down by the _Cryptosporidium_ parasite. The tourists, mainly from
Scotland and Lancashire, suffered cramps, diarrhea and vomiting after
catching the water-borne illness. They were diagnosed by their GPs after
returning from the all-inclusive resort.

JMC Holidays, which is owned by Thomas Cook, said it was satisfied there
was no cause for concern. A spokesman said: "We are confident that the
hotel is being managed in a safe manner. Monthly audits show it is one of
the most hygienic hotels in Europe."

But Holiday TravelWatch, which has been in touch with all the affected
guests from Club Aguamar, said the hotel's plumbing system could be
harboring the parasite.

Director Brenda Wall said: "Since it is a water-borne parasite it is very
hard to eradicate. It could be in the water so the hotel needs to be closed
while the whole system is flushed out. If people who have contracted the
parasite go to other pools in the area there could be an epidemic."

A spokesman for JMC said tests had failed to identify the presence of the
parasite in the swimming pools. But JMC asked the 1,600-room Club Aguamar
resort to suspend use of the pools as a precautionary measure while
chemical treatment and further tests were carried out, he added. Guests
currently staying at the hotel were offered use of alternative facilities,
he said.

[_Cryptosporidium_ is a ubiquitous parasite with reservoir in calves and
small rodents. Surface water gets contaminated from animal feces and
outbreaks are common in areas where the drinking water is surface water. It
is unlikely that the parasite is present only in the water supply system of
the hotel. Rather it must be introduced in the water supply somewhere if
that is the source at all. This outbreak again stresses the fact that
_Cryptosporidium_ is unaffected by standard chlorination schemes. - Mod.EP
