Germany: Definition of High-Risk Areas for Tick-borne Encephalitis
-------------------------------------------------
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is particularly prevalent in central
and eastern Europe. The disease caused by TBE virus affects the
central nervous system and can, particularly in adults, cause serious
neurological sequelae and, in some cases, death. TBE virus (genus
_Flavivirus_, family _Flaviviridae_) exists extensively in wild
populations in southern Germany. This has been verified in prevalence
studies of TBE virus in ticks (_Ixodes ricinus_) and in studies of
the antibody status of exposed persons. The infection risk posed by
the TBE virus in the wild thus necessitates preventive measures for
individuals at risk. Exposure prevention and immunisation are
recommended for people at risk through their work (e.g. forestry
workers), tourists, and people performing outdoor activities in
affected areas.
To target preventive measures effectively, the risk of infection for
each region has been estimated. Laboratory tests to determine the
virus prevalence in ticks or the antibody prevalence in human beings
or animals have not been universally carried out, and so TBE
incidence is used instead. Because universal immunisation has not
been implemented in Germany and the uptake of selective vaccination
is still quite low, it is possible to use the incidence of human
cases to indicate geographic risk.
Since 1997, data on clinically and laboratory verified indigenous TBE
cases have been collected systematically, and the specific risk for
county and urban districts has been published annually. To improve
data reliability and reduce variation, data covering the past 20
years are taken into consideration. A map of TBE risk areas appears
yearly in the Epidemiologisches Bulletin, the weekly bulletin of the
Robert Koch-Institut (1,2).
A district is designated a TBE risk area if at least 5 indigenous TBE
cases have occurred in any 5-year period during the past 20 years, or
at least 2 indigenous cases notified within one year. Districts with
at least 25 cases within any 5-year period during the past 20 years
are classified as TBE high-risk areas. Publicising these areas forms
the basis of targeted preventive measures such as vaccination for
exposed persons. It also provides the basis for official
recommendations on immunisation and the (voluntary) financial
provision for these vaccinations by health insurance schemes.
In addition to the identified TBE risk areas there are also areas in
the same region where increased prevalence of TBE antibodies was
found in forestry workers in a study carried out in 1997-1999,
although no TBE cases were reported. Preventive measures for those at
particular risk of exposure are also recommended in these areas.
In 2001 TBE notification data became available and were used in
addition to clinic and laboratory-based data. Since 2002, only
notification data have been added to the existing case database. A
specific rather than sensitive case definition is used, and each
reported case is verified at RKI using strict criteria. Where
required, missing data on clinical presentation, laboratory
parameters, and the exact area where the infection was contracted are
subsequently collected.
To create a map of TBE risk areas, data from 1884 TBE cases were
used, covering the period 1983-2002. 114 of these cases occurred in
2002. The cases were distributed regionally (see table). 80 of
Germany's 440 city and county districts are currently classified as
TBE risk areas. In 2002, 6 new districts were identified, changing
the regional totals (see table).
Table: Number of TBE cases and number of TBE risk or TBE high-risk
districts by Bundesland, Germany 2003 (Source: Robert Koch-Institut):
Region / Number of cases / Number of districts identified as "risk"Â™
or "high risk" areas in 2002 (2001)
Baden-Wuerttemberg / 53 / 29 (29)
Bavaria / 42 / 44 (40)
Hessen / 7 / 4 (3)
Thueringen / 6 / 2 (1)
Sachsen / 3
Niedersachsen / 2
Rheinland Pfalz / 1 / 1 (1)
All newly identified risk areas border on already known risk areas.
The declaration of new risk areas in 2002 does not necessarily
indicate that the incidence of TBE has increased. The actual reasons
may include increased vigilance and better documentation of the
disease. Further studies of TBE virus prevalence in ticks in these
areas will provide a better assessment of TBE risk.
