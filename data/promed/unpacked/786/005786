Senegal
-------
During September 2013, Senegal reported the reoccurrence of the disease to the OIE (ProMED archive number 20130924.1964250). Two new outbreaks were reported in the latest follow-up report (10 Oct 2013). These outbreaks were situated in the Saint Louis region, and the total number of affected animals were 208 goats (37 cases, 8 deaths). The complete details on these latest outbreaks in Senegal are available at: http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=14211

[Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a peracute or acute zoonotic disease of domestic ruminants in Africa. It is caused by a single serotype of a mosquito-borne bunyavirus of the genus Phlebovirus. The disease occurs in climatic conditions favouring the breeding of mosquito vectors and is characterised by liver damage. The disease is most severe in sheep, goats and cattle, in which it produces abortions in pregnant animals and a high mortality rate in the newborn.

For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.1.14 "Rift Valley Fever" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.14_RVF.pdf

Humans usually get RVF through bites from infected mosquitoes and possibly other biting insects that have virus-contaminated mouthparts. Humans can also get the disease if they are exposed to the blood, body fluids, or tissues of infected animals. Direct exposure to infected animals can occur during slaughter or through veterinary and obstetric procedures. Infection through aerosol transmission of RVF virus has occurred in the laboratory.

RVF virus can cause several different disease syndromes. People with RVF typically have either no symptoms or a mild illness associated with fever and liver abnormalities. However, in some patients the illness can progress to hemorrhagic fever (which can lead to shock or hemorrhage), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain, which can lead to headaches, coma, or seizures), or ocular disease (diseases affecting the eye). Patients who become ill usually experience fever, generalized weakness, back pain, dizziness, and extreme weight loss at the onset of the illness. Typically, patients recover within two days to one week after onset of illness. http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/spb/mnpages/dispages/rvf/rvf_qa.htm

Communication regarding disease risk and awareness campaigns on risk mitigation is essential in protecting humans from RVF infections by limiting exposure to the RVF virus for populations at risk, such as farmers, veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers. A communication strategy, jointly prepared by the animal and human health authorities, will increase the chances of decreasing the population's risk of exposure to the RVF virus and subsequent disease, as well as increasing consumer confidence and avoiding miscommunication on food safety concerns. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf

In 2010 Mauritania sent an immediate notification to the OIE reporting 3 outbreaks on RFV which occurred in the northern desert region of Adrar. This event was resolved on 28 Feb 2011. Details on these outbreaks and the interactive map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=10054

Pictures of RVF clinical signs in camels affected in a 2010 outbreak can be seen at, http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/17/10/11-0397-f2.htm

The most current official information from Mauritania can be found in its 2nd OIE 6-monthly report for 2012. In October 2012, 3 outbreaks of RVF were reported. These were located in the Magta-Lahjar region and the affected species were camelidae (640 susceptible, 78 cases), and sheep and goats (540000 susceptible, 1120 cases, 56 deaths). http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail
(Note: to view the information on RVF, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease, country and time period).

In early September 2012, a human case of RVF was reported in Mauritania. By 30 October 2012, a total of 6 regions were affected with 34 human cases of RVF, including 17 deaths. Only the southern regions of Mauritania, those closest to the usual enzootic areas along the Senegal River, seem to have been involved in this event. See http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf and ProMed archive number: 20121102.1387490.

The distribution in animals and humans from 2002 to 2012 can be found in the article on Rift Valley Fever- Vol 27, December 2012 - published by Emergency prevention systems (EMPRES WATCH), FAO. http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap392e/ap392e.pdf

In this latest immediate notification, the reported absence of [livestock] mortality is surprising. RVF is a serious disease in small ruminants, mortality - especially in lambs and, to a somewhat lower rate in kids, is known to be common. This phenomenon may be seen provided the flocks include young animals. In other seasons, older animals may suffer waves of abortions.

In the most current "Outbreak Bulletin" provided from WHO African region (January to July 2013), no outbreaks of RVF were reported. http://www.afro.who.int/en/clusters-a-programmes/dpc/epidemic-a-pandemic-alert-and-response/outbreak-news.html - Mod CRD/AS
