Outbreak statistics
Species / Apparent morbidity rate / Apparent mortality rate / Apparent case
fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Goats / 59.70 per cent / 11.94 per cent / 20.00 per cent / 59.70 per cent
* Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction,

[Tajikistan is a mountainous, landlocked country in Central Asia.
Afghanistan borders it to the south, Uzbekistan to the west, Kyrgyzstan to
the north, and People's Republic of China to the east. Tajikistan also lies
adjacent to Pakistan but is separated by the narrow Wakhan Corridor.

According to the information available on OIE's website (WAHID), the only
bordering country which has reported CCPP is Afghanistan; its most recent
positive report dates back to Jan-Mar 2005. No later information on CCPP in
Afghanistan has been submitted, but it may be assumed that the disease has
not disappeared since. Pakistan (adjacent but having no direct common
borders with Tajikistan) is infected as well (duly reported the presence of
CCPP each year, including 2008).

According to Tajikistan's OIE annual report for 2008, the goat population
is 1 253 727 animals in 2090 establishments. Contagious caprine
pleuropneumonia (CCPP) is a severe disease of goats caused by _Mycoplasma
capricolum_ subspecies _capripneumoniae_ (Mccp). This organism is closely
related to 3 other mycoplasmas: _M. mycoides_ subsp. _mycoides_ large
colonies (LC), _M. mycoides_ subsp. _capri_ and _M. capricolum_ subsp.
_capricolum_. Unlike true CCPP, which is confined to the thoracic cavity,
the disease caused by the latter 3 mycoplasmas is accompanied by prominent
lesions in other organs and/or parts of the body besides the thoracic cavity.

Typical cases of CCPP are characterised by extreme fever (41-43 deg
C/105.8-109.4 deg F), high morbidity and mortality rates in susceptible
herds affecting all ages and both sexes, and abortions in pregnant goats.
It appears to be transmitted by an infective aerosol. After about 2-3 days
of high fever, respiratory signs become apparent: respiration is
accelerated and painful, and in some cases is accompanied by a grunt.
Coughing is frequent, violent, and productive. In the terminal stages,
animals are unable to move -- they stand with their front legs wide apart,
the neck is stiff and extended, and sometimes saliva continuously drips
from the mouth. Postmortem examination reveals fibrinous pleuropneumonia
with massive lung hepatisation and pleurisy, accompanied by accumulation of
straw-coloured pleural fluid.

The disease has been shown recently to affect wild ruminants such as wild
goat (_Capra aegagri_), Nubian ibex (_Capra ibex nubiana_), Laristan
mouflon (_Ovis orientalis laristanica_), and gerenuk (_Litocranius
walleri_). Clinical disease and seropositivity have been reported in sheep
in contact with affected goats, but the role of sheep as reservoirs of
infection is unclear.

Further details on the disease and particularly on its diagnostic
techniques and on vaccine production and testing methods are available at
