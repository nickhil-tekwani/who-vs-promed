TOXIC SPILL - BRAZIL (03)

A technical note was released 11 Apr 2003 to the public by the Health
Secretary of the state of Rio de Janeiro communicating that the
drinking water supplied by the service provider "Aguas do Paraíba" in
Campos dos Goytacazes-RJ was approved for human consumption. The
decision was based on the results of laboratory analyses of drinking
water.
Samples (taken 10-11 Apr 2003) analyzed for volatile and
semi-volatile organic compounds indicated that the quality of treated
water collected from the Rio Paraíba do Sul was within established
standards for human consumption.
Since then, the major's office is warning the local population daily,
via TV and local newspapers, about the health risks of the use of
untreated water from the Paraíba river and ground water wells for
human consumption and irrigation purposes. The state foundation of
Environmental Engineering (FEEMA) has made public the results of its
analyses of samples from 11 points along the affected Pomba and
Paraíba do Sul rivers: <http://www.feema.rj.gov.br>
Most volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds have diminished to
acceptable dissolved concentrations. However, aluminum levels are
still high at some sampling points (i.e., Campos city with sp441,
from 5 mg/ml on 3 Apr to 2mg/ml on 14 Apr 2003).
