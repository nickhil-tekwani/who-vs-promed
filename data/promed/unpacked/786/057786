A 3 day old baby from El Paso County fell ill with a rare strain of infant
botulism in January 2008. The boy has since recovered and was discharged
from the hospital and botulism generally has no lasting effects. Only one
child, a 2 day old, is known to have suffered botulism at an earlier age.

There are 3 main kinds of botulism: foodborne, wound, and infant. In each
case, bacteria produce a neurotoxin that can cause paralysis, muscle
weakness, and other serious symptoms. The foodborne version occurs when the
toxin is pre-formed and ingested in a food product. In infant botulism and
in wound botulism, the toxin is produced in situ. Infant botulism, the
commonest kind of botulism in the USA, represents about two-thirds of all
cases.

The El Paso County child had a rare strain known as type F, one of just 10
such cases worldwide [related to infant botulism - Mod.LL]. The strain type
is insignificant to patients, who experience the same symptoms and outcomes
regardless of the type, said Dr Bernadette Albanese, medical director for
the health department. Type F appears to be associated with younger infants
than other strains, she said.

In 2005, the most recent year for which national statistics are available,
there were 145 cases of botulism nationally, 96 in infants. Colorado had
only one that year. This year [2008], there have been 2 cases in Colorado,
both infants. The other was in Douglas County.

[Infant botulism results from the ingestion of spores of the organism
rather than preformed toxin. It is the commonest form of botulism in the
USA. A much rarer equivalent to infant botulism, adult colonization
botulism, also may occur. Both can be grouped under the umbrella term
intestinal botulism. This term implies in situ production of the
neurotoxin. The following is the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention) editorial note with references removed from the 2003 report of
a cluster of cases of infant botulism in New York City. As noted in the
piece, apparent clusters of infant botulism are quite rare.

"Intestinal botulism is the commonest form of human botulism in the USA;
about 100 cases are reported among infants in the USA annually. Intestinal
botulism occurs rarely in older children and adults. Intestinal botulism
results from colonization and bacterial production of botulinum toxin in
the colon. Swallowing ambient _Clostridium botulinum_ spores, which exist
worldwide in soil and dust, has been proposed as the principal route of
exposure; honey is an avoidable source of some causative spores. A common
source of exposure generally is not identified; apparent clusters such as
the 4 Staten Island cases are rare and often remain unexplained after
investigations are complete. In a cluster of infant botulism cases
identified previously in the mid-Atlantic region of the USA, no common
source of exposure was identified."

This case of infant botulism is noteworthy because of the early onset of
disease with rapid progression as well as the neurotoxin type (F) involved
(most are type A or B). The 2 other very early onset cases of infant
botulism reported also were related to type F disease (1,2) although age of
onset of other cases has been older. Infant botulism overall tends to occur
at 10-12 weeks of age. Type F disease in adults has also been reported. In
a review of botulism taking in the years 1981 to 2002 in the USA (3), of
1269 cases, 13 (about one per cent) were adult type F, which like reports
in infant disease were characterized by a rapid progression to respiratory
failure and paralysis although no deaths occurred.

Although not alluded to in the posting above, it has been recognized that
many cases of type F botulism including many of the infant cases are
related to _Clostridium baratii_ and not _C. botulinum_. Microbiologically,
_C. baratii_, if cultured from the stool of the infant or from a food
source, is clearly differentiable from _C. botulinum_. The 2 type F toxins
are similar but not identical.
