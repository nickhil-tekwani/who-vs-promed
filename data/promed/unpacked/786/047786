Abstract
--------
This article describes _Bacillus anthracis_ strains isolated during an outbreak of anthrax on the Yamal Peninsula in the summer of 2016 and independently in Yakutia [Sakha] in 2015. A common feature of these strains is their conservation in permafrost, from which they were extracted either due to the thawing of permafrost (Yamal strains) or as the result of paleontological excavations (Yakut strains). All strains isolated on the Yamal share an identical genotype belonging to lineage B.Br.001/002, pointing to a common source of infection in a territory over 250 km [about 155 mi] in length. In contrast, during the excavations in Yakutia, 3 genetically different strains were recovered from a single pit. One strain belongs to B.Br.001/002, as the Yamal strains. Despite the remoteness of Yamal from Yakutia, whole genome sequence analysis showed that the B.Br.001/002 strains are very closely related. The 2 other strains contribute to 2 different branches of A.Br.008/011, one of the remarkable polytomies described so far in _B. anthracis_ population. The geographic distribution of the strains belonging to this polytomy is suggesting that this polytomy emerged in the thirteenth century, in combination with the constitution of a unified Mongol empire extending from China to Eastern Europe. We propose an evolutionary model for _B. anthracis_ recent evolution in which the B lineage spread throughout Eurasia and was subsequently replaced by the A lineage except in some geographically isolated areas.

[This is a very interesting paper on the _B. anthracis_ strains recovered from Yamal and Yakutia. What they suggest is that this pathogen has a long and interesting history in this part of Siberian Russia. One can only look forward with interest to the discussions that will arise anew. Relevant comments can be seen in:

But we haven't heard the last of this special _B. anthracis_ ecology.
