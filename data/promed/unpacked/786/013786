The EPPO Secretariat has gathered the notifications of non-compliance
for 2004 received since the previous report (EPPO RS 2004/127) from
the following countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic,
Denmark, Estonia, France, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy,
Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United
Kingdom. When a consignment has been re-exported and the country of
origin is unknown, the re-exporting country is indicated in brackets.
When the occurrence of a pest in a given country is not known to the
EPPO Secretariat, this is indicated by an asterisk (*).
The EPPO Secretariat has selected notifications of non-compliance
made because of the detection of regulated pests. Other notifications
of non-compliance due to prohibited commodities, missing or invalid
certificates are not indicated. It must be pointed out that the
report is only partial, as many EPPO countries have not yet sent
their notifications.

[Cms followed by PepMV were the most frequently detected pathogens.
Note that PepMV was detected in 2 countries (France and India) but [its
occurrence in those countries] was not known to the EPPO Secretariat. PepMV
is highly contagious and seeds are often subjected to decontamination
procedures with variable results. Selecting known sources of PepMV-free
tomato seeds is the best procedure. Screening seedlings for freedom from
PepMV is the 2nd choice but is risky. - Mod.DH]
