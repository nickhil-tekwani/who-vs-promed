The Committee of Cattle Health of Chiapas confirmed that at least 100 cases
of paralytic rabies were reported in the municipalities of the zones
Istmoo-Costa, Soconusco, Frailesca, North and Jungle. The president of the
Committee, Jose Rafael Vila Calzada, said that the disease was not new in
Chiapas, although by its geographic location, has greater risk for
attacking farm animals. He explained that due to the proximity of Chiapas
with Guatemala, there are animals that enter carrying diseases that are
encountered in the fertile terrains for their development. He indicated
that this year they have mobilised 20 million pesos in order to combat
paralytic rabies, tuberculosis and encephalitis, among other [diseases.
Vila Calzada announced this work in conjunction with the development of the
subcommittees of Cattle Health and the Unions of Regional Farmers in order
to intensify the campaigns of vaccination and capture of the vampire bat,
the cause [host of paralytic rabies.
He assured the farmers that the 1 600 000 cattle were not at risk if the
vaccination campaigns covered 100 percent of them. [100% is not necessary,
more like >80% and especially small isolated ill-managed herds. He
believed that in a short amount of time they would be able to eradicate
those isolated cases that had presented with the disease.
As well, the manager of the Committee of Cattle Health, David Lopez
Narvaez, considered that the loss of life of animals in Chiapas while bad,
is not serious, although [he stressed that the cattle dealers should
vaccinate the self-moving ones [cattle, as well as to report suspicious
cases. Even given the picture that is appearing in Chiapas, Lopez Narvaez
admitted that there will not be problems for the commercialization of about
300 000 yearling calves this year in the national and international markets.

400 000 doses of vaccine available to combat rabies in cattle in Chiapas
Tuxtal Gutierrez, Chiapas - The Regional Coordinator to the Secretary of
Agriculture, Ranching and Rural Development (Sagar) -- Roberto Navarro
Lopez -- informed that there will be 400 000 doses of vaccine ordered to
combat the paralytic rabies produced by the vampire bat, which is affecting
the cattle. He explained that since the beginning of the year there has
been a loss of at least 700 head [of cattle in the municipios of Palenque
and Tonala.
In press conference he indicated that to confront this disease caused by
the bite of the vampire bat, the branch authorities have arranged to apply
more than 60 000 [doses of vaccine in the Coastal and Northern regions of
the state, where the problem has been become serious.
He indicated that there are two alternatives to control the well-known
disease, also known as derriengue, one is annual vaccination, the other is
the capture of the bat that transmits of the paralytic rabies, a viral
disease that affects the central nervous system.
Navarrese Lopez added that the animals that acquire this disease,
present/display difficulties in walking, constipation, paralysis of the
hind legs and finally death, about five days after having
presented/displayed the clinical signs. He requested the ranchers to assume
the responsibility to vaccinate the cattle. He urged them approach the
Secretarieat of Agriculture and Cattle ranching and go to the offices of
the Sagar and (SAG), in order to obtain preventive measures for the ongoing
disease activities in Chiapas.
Finally, the civil servant commented that the disease also has appeared in
other regions of the area including the Center, Fraylesca, and now in the
Coast and the North of Chiapas.

[With 800 cattle dead of rabies in the region since the beginning of the
year, this cannot be regarded as anything but a serious situation.
Vaccination and vampire bat control are well proven techniques for
controlling bovine rabies in Latin America if pursued actively. The usual
technique for controlling vampire bats is to smear captured bats with
poisons, my memory says it was anticoagulants, which through mutual
grooming get dispersed in the bat colony on the bat's release. From the
numbers dead I suspect that the situation began well before the end of last
year. There are a number of vampire bat species involved in rabies and with
different roosting habits. In my experience in Brazil, vampire bat rabies
would break out in cattle some two to three years after forest & woodland
clearances because the bats no longer had sufficient animals to feed on in
the forest and were forced to search outside, which brought them to feed on
the cattle. - MHJ
