As a result of the poisoning of 220 customers, the State Commission for the Protection against Sanitary Risks (Cofepris) has suspended 8 restaurants, a distribution center, and 2 suppliers of the "Que Rollo Sushi" chain, which produces sushi rolls. "After eating at these businesses, 220 people were reported ill in 2 separate events", which resulted in Cofepris initiating an investigation into the quality of the products and sanitary conditions in which the company operates," said the commission in a statement.

Among the reasons for the suspension were the lack of control over the temperature and malfunction of the freezers, in addition to the lack of appropriate manuals for food preparation and cross-contamination in the tables for the preparation of the sushi.

"The investigation is continuing as the federal inspectors took 36 samples of food and products for microbiological analysis in the laboratory. The results will start to become available next week," added the agency.

[As the number of reported cases increases, the microbiological etiology of the cluster has yet to be stated. Knowing the incubation period, the symptoms of illness (other than the previously mentioned vomiting and diarrhea in Foodborne illness - Mexico: (SO) sushi 20140409.2389791), the presence or absence of fever, and the length of illness can be useful in formulating possible causes. - Mods.LL/MPP
