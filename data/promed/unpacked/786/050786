Edward McSweegan raises an interesting issue. Very little work has been
reported on long term follow-up of patients after recovery from severe
leptospirosis.
Shpilberg et al. (1990) examined 11 patients a mean of 22 years (range 6-24
years) after acute infection, of whom 4 were still complaining of
persistent headaches. Neurologic and EEG exams revealed no abnormalities.
[Shpilberg, O. Long-term follow-up after leptospirosis. Southern Med J
1990; 83: 405-407.
It should be remembered that aseptic meningitis is a common presentation of
severe, anicteric leptospirosis, and is often but not exclusively
associated with infection by serovar canicola. Many other serovars may
produce a similar clinical picture.
See for example: Beeson PB & Hankey DD. Leptospiral meningitis. Arch Intern
Med 1952; 89:575-583. More recently a series of three papers by Bezerra et
al. on CNS infection (Bezerra, H. et al Arq Neuropsiquiatr [Sao Paulo
1993; 51: 457-463, 464-468 and 469-474).
Edward McSweegan also said: "Given suggested infection rates in Baltimore
and Detroit, and the likelihood that leptospirosis is the most common
rat-transmitted infectious disease in the U.S., are cases of U.S. urban
leptospirosis going undetected...."
I would suggest that most undiagnosed cases in the USA (and probably other
temperate countries) are so because of a low index of suspicion on the part
of clinicians, the unavailability of FDA-approved rapid diagnostics (in the
USA at least), and at least in part the misconception that this is
exclusively a "rat-transmitted disease". Recent ProMed postings have
emphasized that dogs are important in the transmission of leptospirosis to
humans. The literature is replete with reports of human leptospirosis
acquired from pets or from stray dogs, even those which have been immunized
against canicola infection, even in the USA.
The development and evaluation of rapid and specific diagnostic tests for
leptospirosis is an active area in the few laboratories that specialise in
this disease. However, there was a lot known about the epidemiology of
leptospirosis, long before we had techniques such as PCR, that we should
not forget.
