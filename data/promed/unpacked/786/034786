[3] USA: elimination unlikely
Date: Fri 30 Sep 2022
Source: Times Leader, Associated Press (AP) report [edited]
https://www.timesleader.com/wire/nation-world/1577057/some-officials-now-say-monkeypox-elimination-unlikely-in-us


Some US health officials are conceding that monkeypox is probably not going away anytime soon.

The disease's spread is slowing but the virus is so widespread that elimination is unlikely, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. That conclusion was in a recent and echoed Friday [30 Sep 2022] by Marc Lipsitch, director of science in the agency's disease-forecasting center.

Lipsitch hesitated to say monkeypox is permanently here to stay, but he said it stands to be a continuing threat for the next few years.

"It's in many geographic locations within the country" as well as in other countries, Lipsitch told The Associated Press. "There's no clear path in our mind to complete elimination domestically."

The virus has mainly spread among gay and bisexual men, though health officials continue to stress that anyone can be infected. It's important that people at risk take steps to prevent spread and that vaccination efforts continue, Lipsitch said.

The CDC report contained some good news: The US outbreak seems to have peaked in early August [2022]. The average number of daily cases being reported -- fewer than 150 -- is about 1/3 what it was reported in the middle of the summer, and officials expect the decline will continue for at least the next several weeks.

Lipsitch attributed the good news to increasing vaccinations, cautious behavior by people at risk and infection-derived immunity in the highest risk populations.

Dr Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, agreed that it's unlikely that spread of monkeypox will stop in the US anytime soon, but he said it's still possible in the long term.

If domestic transmission were stopped, infections may still continue if people catch the virus while traveling internationally, he said. But the declining cases makes it seem like "we've turned a real corner."

"The efforts underway are succeeding, and should be continued, if not intensified," he said.

With case numbers going down, this is a good time for local health departments to take a new stab at doing intensive contact tracing to try to stop chains of transmission, he said.

Monkeypox is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals, but it wasn't considered a disease that spreads easily among people until May [2022], when infections emerged in Europe and the US.

There have been more than 67 000 cases reported in countries that have not historically seen monkeypox. The US has the most infections of any country -- more than 25 600. One US death has been attributed to monkeypox.

More than 97% of US cases are men. The vast majority have been men who reported recent sexual contact with other men.

Though cases have been declining, the proportion of new cases that have information about recent sexual contact has been declining, officials said. That's causing a growing blind spot about how the virus may be spreading, Lipsitch noted.

[4] USA: severe disease and 3 possible deaths, details
Date: Thu 29 Sep 2022 9:50 PM CDT
Source: ABC17NEWS/KMIZ, CNN Newsource report [edited]
https://abc17news.com/cnn-health/2022/09/29/cdc-warns-of-severe-illnesses-from-monkeypox-as-ohio-reports-death-of-a-monkeypox-patient/


The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new warning to health care providers Thursday [29 Sep 2022] about severe illnesses in people with monkeypox.

The alert comes as Ohio reported that an individual with monkeypox has died -- the 3rd known death of a patient with monkeypox in the United States.

Ohio listed the death in an update to its online monkeypox outbreak dashboard Thursday [29 Sep 2022]. The Ohio Department of Health on Friday [23 Sep 2022] said an adult male with monkeypox had died, and the individual had "other health conditions." The CDC told CNN it is aware of the death.

The 1st US death due to monkeypox was confirmed this month [September 2022] in Los Angeles County. The county public health department and the CDC said the person had a severely weakened immune system and had been hospitalized. No further information will be made public, the department said.

A person in Harris County, Texas, who had monkeypox died in August [2022], but the virus' role in that death has not been confirmed.

Deaths from monkeypox are extremely rare, and babies, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems are at greater risk. Among more than 67 000 cases reported globally in the current outbreak, there have been 27 deaths, according to the World Health Organization.

More than 25 000 cases of monkeypox have been reported in the United States, but recent case trends suggest that the outbreak is slowing in the US.

Falling case numbers might be a reflection of rising numbers of people vaccinated against the virus. This week, the CDC announced that it's expanding eligibility for the Jynneos monkeypox vaccine to higher-risk people who have not been exposed to the virus.

According to data posted by the CDC on Wednesday [28 Sep 2022], men at high risk for monkeypox because they have sex with other men or because they live with HIV were 14 times more likely to be infected if they were unvaccinated compared with those who were at least 2 weeks past their 1st dose of the vaccine.

CDC warns of 'severe manifestations' of monkeypox
-------------------------------------------------
The CDC said Thursday [29 Sep 2022] that some people in the US who were infected with monkeypox during the ongoing outbreak have had "severe manifestations" of the illness, extended hospitalizations or "substantial" health problems.

The agency's health alert notes that severe monkeypox can happen in anyone, and most people diagnosed during this outbreak have had mild or moderate illness. Most people whose illness has been severe have had HIV with "substantial immunosuppression," it says.

Some of the severe illnesses have included:
- Coalescing or necrotic lesions requiring extensive surgical care or amputation of an extremity.
- Lesions in sensitive areas like the mouth, urethra, rectum or vagina that cause severe pain and affect daily activities.
- Bowel lesions with significant swelling, leading to obstruction.
- Lesions causing scarring with "significant" effects in areas like the genitals, bowels or face.
- Involvement of multiple organ systems and associated conditions, such as encephalitis, myocarditis, conjunctivitis and corneal ulcerations.

The advisory urges healthcare providers to be aware of risk factors for severe monkeypox and says anyone with suspected or confirmed monkeypox should be tested for HIV. Providers should also check whether the person's immune system may be weakened by another condition or by a medication.

Monkeypox treatment in people who have weakened immune systems should involve stopping any medications that may be affecting the immune system, providing antiretroviral therapy for those with HIV, and possibly using medications such as tecovirimat, known as Tpoxx.

The CDC says people who were exposed to monkeypox through sexual contact should get tested for HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.
