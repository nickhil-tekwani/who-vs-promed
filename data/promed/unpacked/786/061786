[1] Efforts to halt cassava and banana devastation in East and Central Africa

Efforts by the Crop Crisis Control Project (C3P) to mitigate the
effects of cassava mosaic virus disease and banana _Xanthomonas_ wilt
(BXW) in 6 countries of East and Central Africa are impacting
positively on the lives of thousands of farmers in Burundi,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.
Funded by USAID, C3P is being implemented by the Catholic Relief
Services in partnership with the International Institute for Tropical
Agriculture (IITA) and 35 other regional and local partners. The
project, which commenced in April 2006, is expected to end in October
2007.
According to the quarterly report of the project, a total of 706.5
hectares of cassava-resistant materials are in production across the
6 countries. This represents a 30 percent increase over the C3P
target. "Using a proxy of one ha to serve 200 households over 2
cropping seasons, it is estimated that the 706.5 ha produced under
C3P will serve 141 300 farming households and will have a direct
impact on 850 000 people and an indirect impact on 1.7 million
people," says the report. In addition, an estimated 11 304 farmers
have been trained on BXW management practices in the 6 countries,
which is double the C3P target. The training has a direct impact on
45 216 households, exclusive of households gaining knowledge of BXW
from radio and poster messages across the 6 countries.
Cassava provides daily caloric intake for more than 200 million
people in sub-Saharan Africa, and IITA has developed several improved
varieties resistant to CMD and other diseases. The varieties are
drought-resistant, early maturing, high yielding, and low in cyanide
content. An estimated 20 million people eat banana or plantain as
their major source of dietary carbohydrates in Africa. The 2 crops
are particularly important in East Africa, where they constitute the
main staple food for about 50 percent of the population. Here, the
annual consumption reaches over 400 kg per person. IITA has also
developed several appropriate technologies for improved production of
the crop. According to FAO, more than 4 million ha are planted into
banana in Africa, with an average yield of 15 tons per hectare.

[2] Kagera farmers unite to fight coffee disease

Coffee farmers in Kagera Region have formed Farmer Field Schools in
an effort to fight and control the spread of the deadly coffee wilt
disease (CWD). The coffee farmers have also resolved to convert
On-Farm Trials plots into Farmers Field Schools, through which other
farmers will be educated on the scale of the CWD and necessary
measures to be taken.
Local farmers report yield losses between 50 and 70 percent as well
as losses of plants on a similar scale. Through proper management and
application of insecticides, the trial plots have shown more
resistance to CWD.
Dr Noah Phiri, a Senior Scientist in Plant Pathology from CABI
Africa, an International NGO based in Kenya, said that between 2001
and 2003, CABI Africa, in collaboration with partner countries,
carried out comprehensive biological surveys to determine the
distribution, severity and impact of CWD.
He said results confirmed CWD presence in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda
and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). However, the disease was not
found in Rwanda, Ivory Coast and Cameroon. In Tanzania, CWD was found
only in the Kagera region and on robusta coffee only, he said.
"Through epidemiological studies, it has been confirmed that in
Uganda, Tanzania and DRC CWD affects only robusta coffee and does not
affect Arabica coffee, even when grown in the same farm." He said CWD
has no boundaries, thus calling for joint efforts to eradicate it.
Kagera Region produces on average 25 000 tons of clean robusta coffee
annually, almost more than half of the total coffee produced in
Tanzania.

[The main diseases affecting cassava are cassava mosaic disease,
cassava bacterial blight, cassava anthracnose disease, and root rot
caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_. Pests and diseases, together
with poor cultural practices, combine to cause yield losses that may
be as high as 50 percent. Banana yields in the region have seen
drastic declines in recent years, with banana _Xanthomonas_ wilt
being a major factor. Coffee is an important cash crop for
resource-poor farmers whose income has been severely affected by
coffee wilt disease. A collaborative, integrated approach to crop
disease control combining pathogen research, developing resistant
cultivars, optimization of cultural practices and farmer education is
showing signs of success in Africa.
IITA is part of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural
Research (CGIAR). CGIAR is a strategic partnership of countries,
international and regional organizations and private foundations to

the work of 15 international research centers.
