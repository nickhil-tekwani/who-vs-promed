Kenya is reporting a large outbreak of the parasitic disease, visceral leishmaniasis (Kala Azar). Since January through the 1st week of August (2019), a total of 1986 cases of leishmaniasis have been reported from Marsabit, Wajir and Garissa counties. Marsabit County has been hit the hardest, reporting 1716 suspected cases with 19 deaths. Overall in Kenya, 27 deaths have been recorded.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease found in parts of the tropics, subtropics, and southern Europe. Leishmaniasis has several different forms.

Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is the most serious manifestation, which affects some of the internal organs of the body (such as the spleen, liver, and bone marrow). VL is predominantly transmitted through the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sand fly, although congenital and parenteral transmissions (through blood transfusions and needle sharing) have been reported.

[Visceral leishmaniasis in Kenya is caused by _L. donovani_, and transmission is believed to be mainly anthroponotic (Alvar J, Velez ID, Bern C, et al., and the WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One 2012;7(5):e35671; supporting information S50: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0035671).

A recent study (Al-Salem W, Herricks JR, Hotez PJ. A review of visceral leishmaniasis during the conflict in South Sudan and the consequences for East African countries. Parasit Vectors 2016;9:460. https://parasitesandvectors.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13071-016-1743-7) concluded that there was a "strong relationship between civil unrest and VL epidemics".

Marsabit is a town in the northern Marsabit County in Kenya. It is situated in the former Eastern Province and is almost surrounded by the Marsabit National Park and Marsabit National Reserve (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsabit). - Mod.EP
