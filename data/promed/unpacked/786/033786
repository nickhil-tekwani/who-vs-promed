[A large number of outbreak farms have been identified with EHD since the
last OIE report on 21 Sep, when 23 infected farms were identified. For a
map locating the outbreak areas, see
<http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/publ/opendoc.pdf?tbl=PUBL&id=3dee2ca30#search=%22Jerada%2C%20Morocco%20map%22>.
Almost half the premises affected had rather high attack rates; 98 out of
the 218 herds had rates of over 33 per cent, but many of these farms are
small, with 8 being the largest number of cases on a single farm. The
overall morbidity rate was 329 cases out of 1814 susceptible animals or 18
per cent, while the mortality rate was 2.2 per cent. While not as severe as
some reports of the related Ibaraki disease in Japan, this outbreak is
clearly not subclinical as sometimes indicated in the literature.
There has also been a recent diagnosis of EHD in Israel since 4 Sep 2006
causing morbidity of 10-40 per cent with a low mortality. Good clinical
descriptions can be found at

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease viruses have been isolated from cattle in
Japan, Africa, Canada, USA, and Australia are generally thought to cause
disease in cattle only rarely. According to the Iowa State Center for Food
Security and Public Health, "The disease is Japan is known as Ibaraki
disease in cattle and is characterized by by eruptions, and may become
lame. In severe cases, animals slough the hoof wall or toe; some of these
deer may be found crawling on their knees or chest. Deer with the chronic
form may also develop ulcers, scars, or erosions in the rumen; extensive
damage to the lining of the rumen can cause emaciation. Ibaraki disease in
cattle is characterized by fever, anorexia, and difficulty swallowing. The
swallowing disorders are caused by damage to the striated muscles of the
pharynx, larynx, esophagus and tongue, and may lead to dehydration,
emaciation, and aspiration pneumonia. Edema, hemorrhages, erosions, and
ulcerations may be seen in the mouth, on the lips, and around the coronets.
The animals may be stiff and lame, and the skin may be thickened and
edematous. Abortions and stillbirths have also been reported in some
epidemics. Some affected cattle die. Outside Japan, Korea and Taiwan, most
EHDV infections in cattle appear to be subclinical."

All this goes to show that when disease is new to an area, its bite is
worse than its bark. Over time, things usually settle down. - Mod.PC]
