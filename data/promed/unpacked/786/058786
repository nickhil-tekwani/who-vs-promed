New data from U.S. studies seems to confirm that only one dose of
H1N1 [influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009] vaccine will be needed to
protect adults and seniors and that giving seasonal and pandemic flu
shots at the same time should be fine, the head of the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said Friday [9 Oct
2009]. Testing showed that adults and seniors who received a 2nd dose
of the pandemic vaccine didn't get much additional benefit from the
2nd shot, Dr. Anthony Fauci said in a media teleconference.

The response to one dose in both groups was already sufficiently
strong to suggest that the vaccine should offer good protection, and
it has been the working assumption in the U.S. that adolescents and
adults would only need one shot. "We have data that looked good and
suggesting to us (that) one dose of 15 micrograms would be sufficient
for the adults and elderly," said Fauci, who added there was "no
substantial difference between the 2nd dose and (antibody levels seen
at) 21 days following the 1st dose. "That confirms the concept that a
single dose of 15 micrograms is sufficient enough to induce a robust response."

Fauci also revealed preliminary data from another study looking at
whether it was safe to give both seasonal and pandemic flu shots at
the same. Both protect against an H1N1 virus -- though the viruses
are sufficiently different it is thought vaccine against one would
not protect against the other.

There were theoretical concerns, though, that giving 2 flu vaccines
at once might interfere with the immune system's ability to generate
a good response to all the viruses covered in the shots. Seasonal flu
shots protect against 3 [strains] of viruses, seasonal H1N1 and H3N2,
both influenza A viruses and an influenza B virus.

"The vaccine when given simultaneously does not impair the immune
response to either of those (shots)," Fauci said. "That I believe is
going to be important as we roll out the vaccination program. And
individuals will go to their offices and would like at the same time
to get both vaccinations [i.e. seasonal influenza and pandemic
influenza]." Fauci said there were no unusual side-effects seen in
the people who received the 2 vaccines together. "We're seeing pain,
redness and perhaps some swelling that we see very frequently with
injectable vaccines."

He said his institute is now launching new trials, studying the
safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in people with asthma. Other
studies will look at safety and dosing requirements in 2 groups of
people living with HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], pregnant
women, and children and adolescents.

(H1N1) 2009 (59): Canada, vaccination 20090929.3400, and Influenza
pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (64): Canada, vaccination update 20091005.3457)
that certain Canadian provinces were delaying implementation of
seasonal influenza virus vaccination on the basis of unpublished data
contraindicating simultaneous administration of seasonal influenza
and pandemic influenza virus vaccines. The U.S. data (also
unpublished) now suggest that that there are no safety concerns and
that both vaccinations can be administered simultaneously. It remains
to be established whether there will be any diminution of protective
efficacy as a consequence of simultaneous vaccination. - Mod.CP]
