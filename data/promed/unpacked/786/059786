Disease Outbreaks Reported
21 Mar 2000
Viral haemorrhagic fever/Marburg in Democratic Republic of Congo - Update 11
-----------------------------------------------
On 13 Mar 2000 WHO received notifications of possible Marburg haemorrhagic
fever in 8 persons from Durba, Province Orientale, Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC). Clinical samples from 6 patients have been sent to National
Institute for Virology, (NIV), South Africa, and thus far, 3 have been
confirmed positive by virological tests. Initial tests on the 3 other
samples were negative, but other tests are still in progress. The
availability of samples from the 2 other cases is not known at this time.
Since Nov 1999, there have been 30 notifications of possible Marburg
disease from the vicinity of Durba. Twelve of these were negative after
extensive laboratory tests, [see Update 9 leaving a current total of 18
cases: 11 of which are confirmed, and 7 of which are currently classified
as suspect cases because no sample was available (2), the status of samples
is unknown (2), or results are pending (3). Illness has proved fatal in 8
confirmed cases and in 4 suspect cases. Dates of illness onset for the 30
notifications range from 9 Nov 1999 to 7 Mar 2000. Disease onset dates for
confirmed cases range from 8 Jan to 24 Feb 2000. The confirmed cases worked
as gold miners (6), housewives (3), a farmer and a nurse.
Disease activity is clearly still continuing in the area, and appears to be
linked to the gold mine in Durba. Surveillance is continuing, but the
security situation in the area and poor communications and transport mean
that information is only available intermittently. The situation is being
closely monitored by the WHO country offices in Kinshasa [DR Congo and
Kampala [Uganda, the WHO African Regional Office in Harare [Zimbabwe and
WHO Headquarters in Geneva.

[Bob Swanepoel at South AfricaÂ´s NIV uses a large battery of tests on these
sera, yet 12/30 clinical cases have been negative to everything tried.
Does this suggest that a new agent of hemorrhagic fever is lurking on the
Congo/Uganda border? - Mod.JW
