Regarding the question of smallpox vaccine for travellers to Africa because
of the problem with monkeypox there recently, I cannot claim to be
authoritative but would recommend that the answer is a definite NO!
Smallpox vaccine is far from an innocuous vaccine and carries substantial
risk (including fatal reactions) to both recipients and to their contacts.
The use of this vaccine should be restricted to those who work with pox
viruses in a laboratory setting and even there one could argue the risks
outweigh the benefits. This advice might have to be reassessed IF there was
evidence of significant transmission to travellers with serious outcomes.
