The Veterinary Department of the Ministry of Agriculture announced on Monday [11 Apr 2022] that it intends to launch campaigns against diseases that affect animal flocks, after announcing the registration of several infections and deaths with the hemorrhagic fever virus in Dhi Qar Governorate.

The director of the veterinary department at the Ministry of Agriculture, Thamer Habib Hamza, said in a statement to the official newspaper that "a vaccination campaign against diseases that affect animal foci for the current year [2022] will soon be launched," noting that "it is assumed that there will be at least 4 to 5 free vaccination campaigns during the year to ensure that no disease is transmitted between animals, especially the common ones, and its danger lies in its transmission to humans."

Regarding the nature of the disease, animal epidemiologist Baher Razak explained, according to the newspaper, "Hemorrhagic fever is a viral disease that affects humans, cows, buffaloes, sheep, goats and camels, after exposure to a tick bite that carries the virus, and the infection is transmitted through blood contaminated with tick blood when a person removes the tick from the skin, crushing it or squeezing it with their hands.

He added that "slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians, are the most vulnerable to infection, by its transmission through contaminated blood of carcasses through wounds or mucous membranes," noting that "the disease has never risen to the level of an epidemic, and its first cases were recorded in Iraq in 1979."

The Director of the Public Health Department in Dhi Qar Governorate, Hussein Riyad, announced "20 cases of hemorrhagic fever have been recorded in the governorate since the beginning of this year [2022], including 15 recorded during the past 2 weeks,". He confirmed that "8 patients have died of the cases registered so far," attributing the cause of the outbreak to "the lack of control over the movement of animals between regions within the governorate," according to the newspaper.

Seven people have died of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, known as Congo fever, since the start of last year [2021] after coming into contact with livestock in southern Iraq, a health authorities source said on Monday [11 Apr 2022].

"During the last year [2021] and the first months of this year [2022], we have counted 7 deaths and an 8th person very seriously injured in the province of Dhi Qar," the regional director of public health, Hussein Riyad, told AFP. The victims "all worked in the livestock sector," he said, explaining that the last recorded death dates back "to the beginning of the year [2022]". Dhi Qar is a poor and rural province in southern Iraq where cattle, sheep, goats and buffaloes are raised, animals that are all potential intermediate hosts for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

Transmission of this viral disease to humans occurs "either through tick bites or through contact with the blood or tissues of infected animals, during or immediately after slaughter", according to the World Health Organization. Between humans, the transmission of the disease "may occur following direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or biological fluids of infected subjects", indicates the organization. The virus of this hemorrhagic fever causes death in 10 to 40% of cases.

Congo fever appeared in Iraq "a few years ago before disappearing", then reappearing last year [2021], said Hussein Riyad. He said he did not know the number of infected animals and questioned the transport of livestock "from one region to another without the appropriate veterinary examinations being carried out". "When we detect the disease, we spray insecticides to eliminate ticks on animals and on the ground," Thamer Habib Hamza, head of the Iraqi Ministry of Agriculture's veterinary department, told AFP.

For his part, the spokesman for the Ministry of Health Saif al-Badr indicated that "there is a treatment [for CCHF]. All cases are followed by the Iraqi health services." Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is present in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

[The above 2 reports provide information on 7 CCHF cases reported during 2021-22 with the last case reported in March 2022 [See Crimean-Congo hem. fever - Iraq: (Wasit) MOH 20220318.8702013]

The disease has been endemic to Iraq since 1979, with a few sporadic cases reported across the country. At times, small outbreaks have been reported, with the last outbreak happening in 2021 with 18 cases confirmed in Thi-qar and Ninawa Governorates. [http://www.emro.who.int/pandemic-epidemic-diseases/news/who-builds-capacity-of-rapid-response-team-in-iraq-with-a-focus-on-crimean-congo-haemorrhagic-fever.html]

It is important to raise awareness about the risk factors of the disease, particularly in the population groups likely to be exposed to the virus, and educate them to take precautionary measures to reduce exposure to the virus, such as wearing gloves and protective clothing while handling animals.

Furthermore, appropriate capacity building and training of public health rapid response teams (RRT) should be carried out in order to equip them to control any future outbreaks of this anthropo-zoonotic disease. - Mod.UBA
