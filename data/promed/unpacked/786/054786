The WHO's African regional office said that both Chad and the Central African Republic (CAR) are in the midst of measles outbreaks, with both countries reporting increasing case counts since [1 Jan 2020].

In Chad, 1276 cases, including 14 deaths have been reported since 1 Jan 2020, with 352 suspected measles cases and 4 deaths reported in the week ending on 9 Feb 2020.

"Most, 78%, of the investigated cases never received any vaccination against measles," the WHO said. "60% of the investigated cases were under 5 years of age while 19% were between 5 and 14 years and 14% were 15 years and above."

In CAR, a total of 1498 suspected measles cases, including 15 deaths, have been recorded since [1 Jan 2020]. The outbreak has been ongoing since early 2019. From 1 Jan 2019, through 9 Feb 2020, a total of 5724 suspected measles cases, including 83 deaths (case fatality rate, 1.45%) have been reported in 13 health districts.

Almost 3/4 of the cases (72%) are in children under the age of 5.

There have been more than 100 suspected cases of measles reported in Wandsworth [London borough] since the end of September [2019], mostly among schoolchildren and young adults.

The council has launched a publicity campaign to encourage parents and care [givers] to ensure their child is fully vaccinated, with information sent out via schools, children's centres, libraries, and other settings. Teenagers and young adults are also being encouraged to check their vaccination status. [Special MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccination catch-up clinics have been organized to help tackle the outbreak of measles in Wandsworth; the locations and times are available at the source URL above]

"The MMR vaccine is the only way to protect children against what is a highly infectious and potentially very serious disease," said the council's cabinet member for health and social care, Councillor Melanie Hampton.

[3] Research: Paramyxovirus enzyme complex structure
Date: Mon 17 Feb 2020

https://scienmag.com/atomic-structures-mapped-in-measles-mumps-flu-and-rsv/


- 1st study to map atomic structure of a key enzyme complex in paramyxoviruses, a family of RNA viruses
- Enzyme is responsible for assembling RNA molecules, providing a target for new antiviral drugs
- Although from a different family, coronavirus functions similarly
- Researchers used cryo-EM, a revolutionary technique that gives a clear view of proteins

Northwestern University researchers have, for the 1st time, determined the 3D atomic structure of a key complex in paramyxoviruses, a family of viruses that includes measles, mumps, human parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

This information could help others design and develop antiviral drugs for these viruses as well as for coronavirus, which functions similarly to paramyxoviruses.

"This takes some of the guesswork out of designing drugs," said Northwestern's Robert Lamb, who co-led the study. "Traditionally, you have to develop drugs randomly and hope you hit a target, but it doesn't happen very often."

To find the unique structure, researchers used cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The relatively new technique enables researchers to peer inside molecules to determine the 3D shape of proteins, which are often thousands of times smaller than the width of a human hair.

Before cryo-EM, researchers mainly used X-ray crystallography, which is incapable of capturing high-resolution images of this enzyme. Called a polymerase, the enzyme assembles RNA molecules.

"Crystallography only works for very orderly and organized proteins," said Northwestern's Yuan He, who co-led the study. "Virus polymerase complexes are too big to be crystallized and don't have uniformity."

Although the 1st documented case of mumps occurred in the 5th century and measles in the 9th century, researchers did not have the equipment to characterize their atomic structures until relatively recently. A trio of biophysicists received the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing cryo-EM, which ultimately opened the door for Lamb and He.

Cryo-EM works by blasting a stream of electrons at a flash-frozen sample to take many 2D images. For this study, He and his team captured hundreds of thousands of images of one sample of human parainfluenza virus 5 polymerase. The team then used computational algorithms to reconstruct a 3D image.

The resulting image was an irregular, round-shaped globule with a long tail made of 4 phosphoproteins (or proteins containing phosphorous). The structure contains more than 2000 amino acids and 5 proteins.

"Part of the image was expected," Lamb said. "But part of it was a surprise. 2 of the proteins are completely new. They have never been seen before."

Another surprise: the team found that this virus uses the same protein to switch between genome replication and transcription.

"This machinery has a dual-function," He said. "It gets both jobs done with one enzyme. The virus's genome is so small, and this gives it economy of scale."

Lamb and He hope this work can help others design and develop new drugs for illnesses such as measles and mumps, which have experienced outbreaks in past years.

"A lot of people don't want to get vaccinated, and they're getting the disease," Lamb said. "And for people who are vaccinated, it still takes 3 to 4 weeks for that vaccine to take effect. We need more antiviral drugs so people who get infected can be treated immediately."

Significance
------------
Parainfluenza virus 5 belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae, whose members pose significant health burdens to humans and animals. The viral RNA genome is packaged within a nucleoprotein complex that serves as the template for genome replication and transcription. The L protein is responsible for RNA synthesis, capping, and methylation, and requires a cofactor; the P protein, for RNA synthesis in vivo. This study provides a near-atomic resolution structure of a complete paramyxovirus L-P complex, an attractive target for drug design against paramyxoviruses. Comparisons to structures of other mononegavirus polymerases identify a large conformational rearrangement of the methyltransferase and CTD relative to the RdRp domain, a potential mechanism that could allow the complex to switch between genome replication and transcription.

[4] Measles complications

Complications of measles can include hepatitis, appendicitis, and viral meningitis, doctors warn
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This entirely preventable viral infection can affect many different organs in the body. The complications of measles can be many and varied, and more serious than people might realise, doctors have warned in the journal BMJ Case Reports after treating a series of adults with the infection.

In 2017, the global death toll from measles reached 110 000. Most of these deaths were in young children.

The authors treated 3 people with measles who had additional complications as a direct result of their infection.

The 1st case concerned a young man, who had only had the 1st of 2 doses of measles vaccine as a child. He was additionally diagnosed with hepatitis.

The 2nd case involved a young woman who developed appendicitis associated with measles.

In the 3rd case, a middle aged man complained of blurred vision and severe headache. He was diagnosed with viral meningitis, caused by his measles infection.

All 3 people recovered fully after appropriate treatment and care, and none had any long lasting health problems as a result of their illness.

But because measles suppresses the immune system, it has been associated with complications in every organ of the body, note the authors. Almost 1/3 of all reported cases are associated with one or more complications, they point out.

These can include pneumonia, febrile seizures, and encephalomyelitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord) which causes neurological problems.

Another possible complication of measles is SSPE (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), a progressive neurological disorder that causes permanent nervous system damage and leads to a vegetative state.

"Large outbreaks with fatalities are currently ongoing in European countries which had previously eliminated or interrupted endemic transmission," write the authors, adding that in the 1st 6 months of 2019 alone, 10 000 measles cases were reported in Europe.

They attribute the rise in new cases to negative publicity in the early 2000s linking the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine to autism, despite major studies proving otherwise. This prompted a fall in vaccine uptake and collective ('herd') immunity.

"Urgent efforts are needed to ensure global coverage with 2-dose measles vaccines through education and strengthening of national immunisation systems," they conclude.

Abstract
--------
Measles, which was once thought to be a disappearing viral infection due to effective vaccination, has been re-emerging globally, with increasing cases in adolescents and adults. This has been attributed to anti-vaccination campaigning in the early 21st century, which has resulted in a drop in overall herd immunity. In this case series we report 3 patients with complications secondary to measles who presented to a hospital in Malta in 2019. Through this series, we discuss the range of possible complications caused by the measles virus, ranging from mild viraemic symptoms to multiorgan involvement which could possibly lead to high-dependency care and may even be fatal. We also highlight recent global statistics which reflect the exponential increase in the incidence of measles, with a special focus on Europe. It is emphasized that vaccine education and compliance with the 2-dose measles vaccine should be implemented worldwide.
