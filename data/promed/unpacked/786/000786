The last line of paragraph 2 is not quite correct. Female ticks secrete a toxin that attacks the motor neurons leading to the paralysis discussed. But male ticks do take blood meals. Both sexes attack men and animals and both are haematophagous.

Lennox Applewhaite is quite right, I was wrong. Male ticks do take blood meals.

[My fault as Moderator. I should have caught it. And I worked with _Amblyoma variegatum_ in Guadeloupe in the mid-80s, counting the buggers on cattle peritoneums; a quick and easy method in the field. Anno domini I fear. - Mod.MHJ
