[Bluetongue is strictly seasonal in Israel, occurring between July and
December, generally peaking in October-November. The disease affects
clinically exotic and cross-bred breeds, with various severity rates, while
local Awassi sheep -- rather similar to caprines and bovines -- undergo
subclinical infections.
The BTV serotypes which have been recognised since 1951 in Israel are
2,4,6,10 and 16, with BTV-4 being dominant. The current outbreak has not
yet been serotyped.
