The number of confirmed dengue cases have reached 55 483 in Bahia up
to 17 Apr of this year [2009], which represents a 220 percent
increase compared to the same period in 2008. Of this total, 47
people have died [of dengue].

These numbers were released on Monday [27 Apr 2009] by the
Secretariat of Health of Bahia. The municipalities of Jequie,
Itabuna, Porto Seguro, Ilheus, and Salvador had practically half of
the confirmed [dengue] illnesses. Of this total, 389 people were
victims of DHF (dengue hemorrhagic fever). According to the bulletin
, 82 percent of the municipalities in Bahia recorded dengue cases.

According to the Endemic Coordination unit of Castanhal, of the 77
recorded dengue [cases] in the city, 19 were DHF. From January to
April [2009], with the increase in rainfall and the accumulation of
large amounts trash in the center and the periphery [of the city],
there was increased proliferation of the mosquito. According to the
Coordination unit, the disease tends to worsen in 2 situations: by
self-medication and when there is delay in receiving medical aid.

The Coordination of Endemics unit of the Secretariat of Health,
asserts that one of major challenges to be overcome are the many
wastelands [vacant lots] existing throughout the city. According to
the unit, a partnership was established with the Castanhal Department
of [Public] Works (Semob) to be sent information concerning such
land. The Semob should notify the owners. The population should also
be directed to not continue to discard trash on land that should,
indeed, be [kept] clean.

The most recent totals released by the Ministry of Health in early
April [2009] said that throughout the country dengue [viruses]
infected 161 414 people. The number is low, as it does not include
the new data provided by the state secretariats of health. One
example is Bahia. In the totals of the federal government were 41 093
[dengue] cases. The government of Bahia said that it reached 54 165
cases [that number is somewhat higher now. See the report from Bahia,
above. - Mod.TY]

Projections of cases can exceed the mark of 200 000 in all the units
[states] of the federation and the Federal District. The 3 states
that have highest number of cases are Bahia (54 165), Minas Gerais
(35 290), and Espirito Santo (30 634); 84 deaths have been recorded.
More than half of these deaths, 47, were recorded in Bahia.

Period covered by this update: 5 Mar-13 Apr 2009.
Summary
-------
The sum of CHF [Swiss Franks] 140 437 (USD 119 658 or EUR 95 033) has
been allocated from the International Federation's Disaster Relief
Emergency Fund (DREF) to support the Bolivian Red Cross (BRC) in
delivering immediate assistance to 9000 households (approximately 44
000 beneficiaries).

Since October 2008, Bolivia is experiencing a dengue outbreak
affecting 6 of the 9 departments [state or province equivalents] in
the country. To date, 25 people have died as a result of DHF and
there are approximately 56 000 cases of unconfirmed classic dengue.

Since October 2008, Bolivia has been facing a dengue epidemic. The
departments of Beni, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba are the most at risk
with a total of 279 120 people living in areas which have a high
incidence of dengue fever. Due to this situation, the Ministry of
Health and Sports declared a national alert due to the dengue
epidemic on 12 Jan 2009.

This year [2009] at least 25 people have died because of DHF,
approximately 56 000 unconfirmed cases of classic dengue have been
reported, and 6516 cases have been [laboratory] confirmed.

The dengue outbreak has surpassed the capacity of the national health
system due to the high number of infected people. Although
fumigations are constant, unless awareness raising amongst the
population takes place on vector control, the problem will remain.
The increased use of non biodegradable containers and inefficient
discarding of solid waste have led to the creation of breeding
grounds for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito. In addition, the high
demand for medical services is putting pressure on the public health
and social security system.

The following table shows [department (state or province equivalent)]
data as of 9 Apr 2009:

Department: unconfirmed / confirmed / deaths
Beni: 3304 / 246 / 0
Chiquisaca: 1085 / 290 / 1
Cochabamba: 4946 / 639 / 4
La Paz: 1115 / 504 / 1
Oruro: 109 / 30 / 1
Pando: 1246 / 42 / 1
Potosi: 50 / 20 / 0
Santa Cruz: 40 227 / 3939 / 17
Tarija: 4085 / 806 / 0

[The total number of dengue cases reported on 30 Mar 2009 was
estimated at more than 53 000 cases (see ProMED archive no.
20090406.1341). The total as of 13 Apr 2009, cited above, increased
to over 56 000 cases. One hopes that the epidemic is slowing.

The political and health crisis unleashed in Argentina by the
epidemic of dengue worsened today [24 Apr 2009] after the
organization Doctors Without Flags [Medicos sin Banderas in Spanish,
an Argentina-based non-governmental organization of physicians. -
Mod.TY] reported that there are 100 000 cases in the country, instead
of the 23 thousand estimated by the government.

"There are infected individuals who have no severe symptoms and many
others who have not come to the hospital because they self-medicate,
[therefore] official notifications are not realistic," said Ariel
Umpierrez, member of the organization. He added that there is much
concern and alarm because the northern provinces of the country face
a serious risk by the proliferation of dengue cases.

Umpierrez indicated that Doctors Without Flags calculated number of
patients in accordance with standards established the World Health
Organization (WHO) in facing any epidemic. He explained that the 1st
recommendation is to multiply by 5 the official [number of] cases,
which would exceed even the 100 000 infected individuals that this
organization considers there are already in the entire country.

The official estimates are incorrect, stressed Umpierrez, because
there are people who identify the symptoms as dengue and they know
they can fight it with paracetamol [acetaminophen], so they stay in
their homes.

"We're not saying that the national Ministry of Health Nation is
giving false figures. We are only warning that they are unrealistic;
laboratory confirmation is not the only reality," he said.

[Quantification of the actual number of dengue virus infections given
the wide spectrum of clinical severity over a large geographic area,
in the face of an outbreak, is always challenging. Intensive,
prospective studies that capture mild cases that do not enter the
health care system, invariably lead to an under-estimation of the
numbers of total infections. Capturing these milder case numbers
requires labor-intensive, and very costly household-level surveillance.

The dreaded dengue fever, which has killed 6 people and affected
hundreds so far this year [2009] is fast spreading in the Southern
Province compelling educational authorities to close down 7 schools
in the province, Health Services Director Dr JB Senarath said. He
said the cases reported indicated a 2-fold increase when compared
with the same period last year [2008].

Dr Senarath said that during the 1st 4 months this year [2009] there
were 137 cases of dengue reported from Matara and 65 from Galle,
while 6 of the effected had died. Doctors said in addition to the
usual symptoms of dengue fever the patients undergoing treatment at
hospitals in the South also showed signs of swelling of the liver and
the bloating of the abdomen causing them to question whether the
patients were suffering from dengue or some other disease.

Blood samples have been sent to Colombo for detailed examination.
Tangalle Medical Officer, Dr C Amarasinghe, had also said that
victims who are suspected to have died dengue had shown symptoms that
were different to those suffering from dengue. She said 15 such
patients were being treated at Matara and Karapitiya hospitals.

Zonal Education Director, SH Sunil, said the fast spreading dengue
fever had compelled the authorities to close until further notice the
Tangalle Balika MV; Tangalle boys National School; Tangalle Primary
School; Tangalle Model Primary School; Rahula MV; Polonnaruwa Junior
Vidyalaya, and Muslim Junior School.

He said several awareness programmes were conducted for school
principals and school children and despite the closure of schools
cleaning programmes would continue. Mr Sunil said the schools would
be reopened after health officials confirm that the situation had
returned to normal.

He said parents' ignorance as to the gravity of the problem had
aggravated the situation.

[The occurrence of symptoms not characteristic of dengue virus
infection mentioned in this report require a comprehensive laboratory
diagnosis to determine the etiology of the observed illness. ProMED
will be interested in finding out what the results of the laboratory
tests are, when they become available.

Municipal authorities in Mecca, Jeddah, and Taif are struggling to
control an outbreak of dengue fever in the cities, to the extent that
the World Health Organisation last month [April 2009] sent a
delegation to assess the situation.

While authorities have declined to comment on the outcome of the WHO
visit, various officials have given different figures for the number
of people who have contracted the disease, as well as different
accounts of the seriousness of the outbreak.

The mayor of Jeddah, Adil Faqeeh, told reporters in March [2009] the
number of people afflicted by dengue fever in his city had risen to
104 that month from 84 in February.

In the city of Mecca, the non-governmental National Society for Human
Rights (NSHR) reported last month [April 2009] that nearly 150 people
had been hospitalised with dengue fever in the past 3 months. Press
reports said the number of cases is rising and the disease has spread
to the city of Taif which, along with Jeddah and Mecca, is located in
Mecca [Makkah] province.

Moreover, the daily Okaz reported 2 weeks ago that Mr Faqeeh had
secretly reopened the municipality's crisis management unit, which
had been closed 2 years ago, last month.

However, the Saudi health minister, Dr Abdullah al Rabeeah, told a
press conference on 25 Apr [2009] that only 44 cases of dengue fever
have been reported in total since the outbreak of the disease in
December [2008]. "The ministry of health does not deny the presence
of the fever in [Mecca] province but it is at a very low rate
compared to other parts of the world. Serious efforts are under way
to contain its spread in the region" [he said].

Dr al Rabeeah also denied press reports there had been deaths as a
result of the disease in Mecca province. Okaz reported 2 weeks ago
that a man and a woman, both in their 20s, had died in hospital and
quoted the father of the man as saying dengue fever had been the
cause of his son's death.

According to Mr Faqeeh, the outbreak in Jeddah is concentrated in the
city's slums, where poor sanitation facilities, unclean water, and
the city's still incomplete sewage system all facilitate the spread
of the disease. Sewage in Jeddah is collected in a lake called the
"musk lake," which is a breeding ground for the mosquitoes that
transmit the disease [virus] and is located close to slum areas.

Mr Faqeeh launched an awareness campaign in March [2009] against
dengue fever. The government has spent an estimated 1.4 billion
riyals (United Arab Emirates dirham 1.37 billion) [about USD 373.3
million] on combating the disease, though it is unclear what the
funds have been spent on.

[There is a discrepancy between the numbers of dengue cases over the
past 3 months reported by the National Society for Human Rights (150
hospitalized cases) and those reported by the Ministry of Health (44
total cases). It would be of interest to know how many of these
reported cases are laboratory confirmed. Household water catchments,
rather than the sewage lagoon, are breeding sites of the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito vector of dengue virus, so that is where vector
control efforts should be focused.
