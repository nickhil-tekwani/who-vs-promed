The discovery of a plague-infected cat this month [April 2017] in far Northeast Albuquerque prompted a city health official to warn people not to feed feral animals, and to take precautions against disease when handling strays.

The cat's death, after the death of a pet dog from plague in March [2017], has raised concerns about the re-emergence of plague in North Albuquerque Acres, where the bacterial illness had not been observed since the late 1990s.

North Albuquerque Acres is in far Northeast Albuquerque, west of Tramway NE, including neighborhoods both north and south of Paseo del Norte NE.

Mark DiMenna, deputy director of the city's Environmental Health Department, said city officials have trapped about 30 stray cats in the area and are testing the animals for plague. Test results were not complete on [Mon 17 Apr 2017].

DiMenna said he doesn't expect the city to alter its trap-neuter-return program for feral cats in response to the infected animals. Under trap-neuter-return, cats living in feral colonies are trapped, sterilized, vaccinated, and returned to the area where they were found.

"We are not trying to leverage this to make any changes" to trap-neuter-return, DiMenna said in an interview. "I think the city is pretty committed to this program."

DiMenna urged groups and individuals who work with feral cats to take precautions, such as wearing gloves when they handle cats, and seeking prompt treatment for bites and scratches.

He also urged people not to put out food for feral cats, which can attract wild animals, such as skunks and raccoons, that can carry plague, in addition to predators such as coyotes that prey on cats.

People also need to be aware of clinical signs of plague in both cats and people, which in cats can include swollen lymph nodes, vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and the presence of abscesses, discharge, or bloody sputum. In humans include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, weakness, and painful swelling of the lymph nodes in the groin, armpit, or neck areas.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. Free-ranging carnivores, including feral cats, are particularly exposed to plague as they pray on its reservoir. - Mod.PMB
