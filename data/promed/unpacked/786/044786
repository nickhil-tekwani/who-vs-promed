A Scottish family had to be tested for tuberculosis (TB) after their cats contracted a strain of the infection that can be passed to humans. [NT], 43, from Kirkintilloch, had been feeding her cats the wild venison flavour of Natural Instinct pet food, which is being investigated by Food Standards Scotland over a possible link to TB in cats. Her beloved tabby, Jax, was ill for 9 months before he was diagnosed with the bovine strain of TB, and sadly he passed away in March [2019]. Her older cat, Charlie, is also infected and is currently being treated with antibiotics. Researchers at the University of Edinburgh, who are investigating a possible link between Natural Instinct wild venison cat food and TB, carried out a post mortem on Jax's body. They advised [NT] last week that she and her family should be tested for TB, as the bovine strain can be passed to humans. [NT], her son [AB], 21, and partner [RM], 38, all tested negative for TB. [NT] is keen to warn others, as she treated Jax for months, with no idea she was putting herself at risk of contracting the deadly infection. Dexter, another of her cats who passed away just before Jax, died with fluid in his lungs, and although no diagnosis was confirmed, [NT] suspects he, too, was infected with TB.

"Jax had abscesses on his legs and on his side," [NT] said. "The vets couldn't work out exactly what it was. They kept bursting them, and he had lesions all over his body. They sent him to a dermatologist, and they found it was a macrobiotic infection and said it was bovine TB. He was ill for 9 months, and we only got the results in March. My other cat, Dexter, passed away before we could get the results. He had fluid in his lungs, so we realised he probably had TB as well, as fluid in the lungs is one of the symptoms of TB. My other cat, Charlie, who is almost 5 now, has active TB and is on a course of antibiotics."

Nicole's son, [AB], was in the hospital with pneumonia around the time of Jax's diagnosis, leaving her even more worried, as symptoms of TB and pneumonia can be confused.

"During this time, my son was actually hospitalised," she said. "He was taken in with breathing problems and diagnosed with pneumonia. Jax had open wounds. I was cleaning him for about 9 months. I was exposed to it for 9 months. I just want to get it out there. There are other people with cats who won't know about this."

Natural Instinct is a luxury brand of raw pet food, and the wild venison flavour of cat food was voluntarily recalled in December [2018]. Food Standards Scotland and the Food Standards Agency in England are currently investigating a possible link between the Natural Instinct wild venison cat food and tuberculosis in cats.

A spokesperson for Food Standards Scotland said: "Food Standards Scotland is aware of 2 confirmed cases of bovine tuberculosis in domestic cats in Scotland and of a possible link to raw pet food. Scotland remains officially free of bovine tuberculosis in cattle. The risk of transmission to humans is very low. We are working closely with partner organisations including Health Protection Scotland and the Food Standards Agency on the ongoing investigation."

A spokesperson from Natural Instinct said, "Everything we do at Natural Instinct is done so with the best interests of our customers and their pets in mind."

[Investigations of tuberculosis cases in cats in England, found infected during 2018 by _Mycobacterium bovis_, led the investigators to suspect a batch of raw pet food produced by the British company Natural Instinct as the probable source of the feline tuberculosis (TB) cases in 13 cats. The evidence was presented as "compelling, if circumstantial." The event and paper were covered in posting 20190518.6474673.

According to the current media report, similar cases, probably related to raw pet food from the same source, have been identified in Scotland. - Mod.AS
