The Agriculture Ministry's Animal Health and Production Department said today [Mon 22 Apr 2019] that African swine fever [ASF] that was detected in Ratanakkiri's [Rotanokiri] O'Yadav district, has spread to Ou'Chum district.

Tan Phannara, the department's director, said the disease has spread in the province despite efforts to keep it confined to O'Yadav district's Soam Thom commune.

Efforts include spraying disinfectants, culling infected pigs, and banning the movement of pigs out of the area.

"We have not yet completely contained ASF in O'Yadav district and it has now spread to Ou'Chum district," Mr Phannara said. "Our working teams are now conducting a study to check which communes in the district have been hit by the disease."

"We received reports of sick pigs from the authorities in Ou'Chum district between 11 and 13 Apr 2019 and we have banned the transportation of pigs throughout the province," he added.

On 22 Mar 2019, ASF was detected by Rattanakiri [Rotanokiri] provincial authorities in O'Yadav district's Soam Thom commune and more than 500 pigs were culled.

Officials said then that the disease was spread via contaminated pork brought in across the border from Viet Nam.
