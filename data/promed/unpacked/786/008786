------------------------------------------------------
Summary
------
At 16∶18 on 8 Aug 2021, a hospital in Beijing Municipality reported a suspected case of inhalational anthrax. Six hours later, Beijing CDC reported that pleural effusion sample of the case tested positive for nucleic acids of _Bacillus anthracis_ using fluorescent real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). On 13 Aug [2021], one strain of _B. anthracis_ was isolated from dead cattle in the patient's village. On 19-20 Aug [2021], 2 samples of pleural effusion collected from the patient with 24-hour interval were negative for _B. anthracis_ both by real-time PCR and bacterial culture. This met the requirements for discharging anthrax cases from hospital isolation. A total of 127 close contacts of the case in Beijing were quarantined at designated sites or at home for 12 days from the last contact with the patient.

Investigation
------------
The patient was a 46 year old woman from Weichang Manchu and Mongolian Autonomous County, Chengde City, Hebei Province. The patient had sudden chest pain on 30 Jul 2021 at home with continuous tingling in the right chest, radiating to the right shoulder. The pain worsened when respiring deeply, accompanied by chest tightness, shortness of breath, and asthenia. However, there was no fever, cough, sputum, or hemoptysis. She went to the local county-level, and then prefecture-level, hospitals on 31 Jul [2021] and was suspected of cardiovascular diseases, such as myocardial infarction and aortic dissection. Fever appeared at 14∶30 on 1 Aug [2021]. After screening negative for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the fever clinic, the computed tomography (CT) examination at 21∶00 showed lesions in the right pulmonary hilar and mediastinum with suspected space-occupying lesions, bilateral pleural effusion, atelectasis in both lungs, and pericardial effusion. The results of 2 CT examinations by the hospitals in Beijing were similar.

The patient came to Hospital A in Beijing by an ambulance at 02∶00 on 3 Aug [2021], accompanied by her families. After screening negative for SARS-CoV-2 in the fever clinic, the patient was given symptomatic anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic treatments in the emergency department. Her pain was relieved. The results of the CT examination showed bilateral pleural effusion, atelectasis in both lungs, and space-occupying lesions in the mediastinum.

At 14∶00 on 4 Aug [2021], the patient was transferred to Hospital B by a Beijing Emergency Medical Center ambulance. The medical record for admission of the patient showed that she had no erythema, papules, or vesicles on the skin and no fever, nausea, or vomiting. Moist rales were found by lung auscultation, and the CT showed lesions in the right pulmonary hilar and mediastinum, with suspected space-occupying lesions, bilateral pleural effusion, atelectasis in both lungs, and pericardial effusion. The CT results were similar to previously reported cases. Other clinical findings were liver injury and hypoalbuminemia. A total of 200 mL of hemorrhagic pleural fluid was collected via the closed thoracic drainage method. The patient was treated with imipenem-cilastatinsodium injection and moxifloxacin hydrochloride sodium chloride injection. The 7th group of lymph nodes was positioned by endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and punctured, and some purulent secretions were observed in the puncture fluid. Metagenomic sequencing detected sequences of _B. anthracis_ in the puncture fluid.

Various samples of the patient were collected on 8 Aug 2021. The sample of pleural effusion was positive for nucleic acid of _B. anthracis_ by fluorescent real-time PCR. Serum antibody against _B. anthracis_ was positive by colloidal gold test (Table 1 - see URL above). As a confirmed case, the patient was transferred to the designated infectious disease hospital for quarantine and treatment on the same day. On 19-20 Aug [2021], 2 samples of pleural effusion within a 24 h-interval collected from the case were negative for _B. anthracis_ by real-time PCR and bacterial culture.

The patient's home is in the Bashang Grassland, which was a semi-pastoral area, and the patient often had close contact with cattle and sheep. The patient was also engaged in restaurant operations, so she often visited the meat wholesale market to buy beef and mutton every 2 or 3 days before the disease onset. However, contact with meat or blood of dead animals is more likely to cause cutaneous than inhalational anthrax. The patient had no sign of cutaneous anthrax, no erythema, papule, or vesicle, as shown in the medical records of Hospital B, so the probability of infection from exposure to meat from the market was very low.

The 2 cattle raised by the patient's brother-in-law died of an unknown illness in the morning of 26 Jul [2021] and were slaughtered at once in the backyard of the patient's house. At the same time, the patient's brother-in-law was told by the doctor that he might have cutaneous anthrax; he called from hospital to stop the slaughtering of the 2 cattle. The meat, hide, and other parts of the 2 cattle were disposed of outside the village. The slaughter site was immediately disinfected with 1000 mL of cresol soap solution, the ground was washed with a high-pressure water gun, and the sewage entered the drainage ditch through a drain. In the afternoon, and the next day, the other 2 cattle died and were buried directly. The spore-containing droplets produced by high-pressure water gun washing could have caused the infection of the patient because she had to pass the slaughter site to go to the toilet.

The patient's brother-in-law was 54 years old. He felt itchy on the back of his right hand on 23 Jul [2021] and found a rice-grain-sized rash that gradually reddened and became swollen and painful. The site of skin turned black after the ulceration without fever. In the morning of 26 Jul [2021], he went to the county hospital. The doctor suspected cutaneous anthrax but stained smear examination for the damaged skin was positive for cocci, and no bacilli were detected at the time. The doctor still prescribed levofloxacin infusion therapy for him.

The patient's brother-in-law received levofloxacin infusion therapy for 10 days. He went again to the hospital in town due to pain in his right hand. The hospital found his skin damage site on the back of his right hand to be black with eschar and reported the case. On 9 Aug [2021], the Chengde CDC reported real-time PCR negative results for nucleic acid of B_. anthracis_ of his skin smear sample, but positive for serum antibody against _B. anthracis_ by colloidal gold test. The source of infection for the patient's brother-in-law could have been _B. anthracis_ spores in the soil. The village is located within a historically anthrax-endemic region. The heavy rainfall this year [2021] might have caused the spores in the soil to be exposed on the surface and contaminated the grass. The time of infection could be the same as the cattle or when the patient disposed of the sick cattle.

On 9 Aug [2021], 3 samples of furs [hides] and 3 samples of beef were collected from the buried dead cattle. The beef samples were positive for nucleic acid of _B. anthracis_, and one strain of _B. anthracis_ was isolated by bacterial culture from one sample of the beef.

Discussion
----------
Under natural conditions, primary inhalational anthrax is rare and fatal. The droplets aroused by this high-pressure water gun should contain a relatively small number of bacteria. Healthy people washing the ground may not be infected, but the patient was not in good health and likely vulnerable. However, people with a history of common exposure were at the same risk, so we suggest that these people need to be quarantined.

The patient's first symptoms were atypical, with no fever in the early stage; the chest pain and tightness were suspected at first to be caused by cardiovascular disease. This perhaps was related to being exposed to particles containing lower levels of _B. anthracis_. The patient's medical history in multiple hospitals showed that no epidemiological exposure history was asked by the doctors, which should be one of the reasons for the misdiagnosis. The physicians should be informed to pay more attention to epidemiological history.

The doctors in the local hospitals of Hebei Province showed good awareness of cutaneous anthrax. The doctor in the county-level hospital immediately suspected anthrax and prescribed correct antibiotics for the patient's brother-in-law. Inhalational anthrax was hard to distinguish clinically from other illnesses and was once diagnosed with cardiovascular disease. New techniques like 2nd-generation sequencing would effectively assist the diagnosis. Medical staff should receive training in recognition and management of anthrax.

[A briefer version of what happened was published in Global Times (https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202112/1243764.shtml) and is worth reading for a quick overlook.

This is a puzzler. Pneumonic anthrax is usually very serious and lethal. Clinicians in the UK dealing with drug-related cases found that draining the lesion of toxin-filled bloody fluid was vital in promoting recovery. This was a pneumonic case, and 200 ml of bloody pleural fluid was removed from her chest. The infection appears to have been minimal, but it was laboratory confirmed. Her brother-in-law, who had butchered the 2 dead cows and developed a typical anthrax cutaneous lesion on the back of his hand, tested negative but was serologically positive.

How this woman became infected is not certain, but exposure to the high-pressure water-gunning of the slaughter site is a logical possibility. This would have produced an aerosol of large particles that would not have penetrated deep into her lungs but stopped at her bronchi. This would explain her fortunately modest infection. The family was fortunate.

Hebei Province is in north east China. For a description and map of the province, go to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebei. In past decades, livestock anthrax was common in this region, but lately it is largely unobserved and maybe just very sporadic. - Mod.MHJ
