Xinjiang is an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China in the northwest of the country. Xinjiang borders the Tibet Autonomous Region and India's Leh District to the south and Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the southeast; Mongolia to the east, Russia to the north, and Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India to the west (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang).

Given the location of the Xinjiang region which is bordered by regions and countries that have been affected by PPR, the likelihood that the disease would occur and be detected was high.

Official information obtained from the OIE's WAHID database, shows that the situation of PPR in these bordering countries and regions is as follows:
Tibet Autonomous Region: one outbreak reported in 2010 (see commentary in ProMED-mail archive no. 20100606.1887).
India: 128 outbreaks in 2012; 75 outbreaks from January to June 2013.
Afghanistan: 25 outbreaks in 2012.
Kazakhstan: disease reported as absent, no surveillance is specified.
Kyrgyzstan: disease reported as never occurred; general and targeted surveillance reported as control measures.
Pakistan: disease restricted to certain zone(s)/region(s) of the country); no quantitative data available.
Tajikistan: disease present, and recently reported in October 2013.
Russia: disease never reported; no surveillance specified.
Mongolia: disease never reported; general surveillance indicated as a control measure.
