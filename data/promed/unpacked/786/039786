Preliminary tests indicated the H5N1 strain of bird flu has infected
birds in 2 more villages in eastern Romania, authorities said
Thursday.
The samples were taken from several dead birds found in the villages
of Vlahi, near the Danube River, and Ostrov, near the border with
Bulgaria, said Grigore Mertoiu, who heads the local animal health
agency.
Access was limited to the villages and authorities said they would
cull thousands of domestic birds.
Mertoiu said the virus was likely brought to the villages by
migrating birds that were driven away from Danube wetlands that had
frozen over due to a cold spell. On Sunday [12 Feb 2006], the virus
was detected in the village of Topraisar, also in the Black Sea
region. Authorities began culling the domestic birds in the village
late Wednesday, an operation they said would last 10 days. However,
some villagers hid their fowl or tried to take them out of the
village.
Mertoiu said that 2500 birds would be culled in Vlahi later Thursday.
Topraisar Mayor Stelian Gheorghe was offering rations of bread, rice,
sugar, oil and mineral water to more than 1300 families to help
offset the loss of livelihood from the dead birds.
The deadly H5N1 bird flu strain was first detected in the Danube
Delta in October 2005. Thousands of birds were culled in the region,
one of Romania's poorest. There have been no reported human cases of
bird flu in Romania.

University experts [in Bern] are examining 3 dead swans found in
central Switzerland to see if they were infected with bird flu,
authorities said Thursday. The swans were found in the central
cantons (states) of Aargau, Solothurn and Schwyz, said Marcel Falk,
spokesman for the federal veterinary office.
The discovery of the dead swans was first reported to authorities
Wednesday [15 Feb 2006], Falk said. Results could be expected before
the weekend.
About 600 swans die of normal causes every year in Switzerland, 300
of which are normally noted by the authorities, Falk explained.
Heightened surveillance measures because of the threat of bird flu
could be leading to a higher count of swans that died of normal
causes than usual, he said.

A dead swan found in Slovenia this month had died of the lethal H5N1
avian flu virus strain, according to laboratory tests performed in
Italy, a government spokesman told Reuters on Thursday [16 Feb 2006].
This is the 1st confirmed case of bird flu in Slovenia, a tiny former
Yugoslav republic that joined the European Union in 2004.
"The lab tests from Italy confirmed the H5N1," spokesman Branko
Vidrih said. Slovenia sent samples of H5 virus from a swan found dead
in an area near the city of Maribor, less than 10 km (6 miles) from
the Austrian border last week.

Strong indications that the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu might have
spread to Kogi State emerged with the report by a poultry farm owner
in Lokoja, the state capital, that 70 out of 100 birds in his farm
suddenly died 2 days ago.
Disclosing this to the Nigerian Tribune on Wednesday [15 Feb 2006]
was the Director of Livestock Services in the state Ministry of
Agriculture and Natural Resources, Dr. Edward Abiola.
The director stated that the samples collected from the birds would soon be
sent to Abuja to determine whether the cause of the death of the birds was H5N1
virus or not. The Federal Government resolved on Wednesday to ban rearing and
stocking of poultry within residential premises in the Federal Capital
Territory (FCT), Abuja. All domestic birds in the Presidential Villa are to
undergo tests, and any of them that test positive for the H5N1 virus will be
destroyed.
Agriculture Minister Adamu Bello says all 4 confirmed cases have been
connected to one farm in northern Nigeria. None of that farm's
workers, however, have shown any signs of illness.
Bello, who is in charge of the bird flu campaign, said 40 farms
around Kano city had reported suspicious bird deaths. Reports have
been circulating that chicken farmers are hurrying to sell their
birds before they are culled, as the government compensation offered
in such cases is too low.
Juan Lubroth, senior official with the Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO), said poultry was still being moved around despite
an official quarantine.

[For somewhat clearer details, subscribers are referred to Nigeria's
follow-up report, sent to the OIE on 15 Feb 2006, accessible at
<http://oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/Nigeria_AI_15_02_2006.pdf>
It includes the data on 6 outbreaks, of which 2 are in Kano state and
4 in Plateau state. All the farms are commercial poultry production
units, mostly layers of over 40 weeks of age. The report concludes:
"Presence of the disease is now confirmed and an emergency plan
activated. Further investigation is being carried out all over the
country to determine the source of the infection and prevent its
spread." - Mod.AS]

Germany probably had avian flu for some months before tests earlier
this week confirmed that dead birds had carried the virus, a state
agricultural minister said in a TV interview on Thursday.
Till Backhaus, from the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern where the birds were
found, said the affected mute swans were not migratory and tended to stick to
one area. "This is why I assume ... that the virus must have been introduced in
autumn [2005]," Backhaus told public broadcaster ZDF.
German authorities said on Wednesday that 2 swans and a hawk found on
the Baltic Sea island of Ruegen were infected with H5N1. Further
tests should confirm later on Thursday whether it was the highly
pathogenic strain transmittable to humans.
Local officials said on Wednesday some 100 dead swans had been
spotted in the affected area.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the southern state of Bavaria have already
banned farmers from keeping poultry outdoors. A nationwide ban takes
effect on Friday [17 Feb 2006].

[ProMED-mail has been approached by subscribers who have
re-emphasised the need for accurate information on the species of
wild birds, when discussed.
The genus _Cygnus_ includes the following species:
Whooper swan, _Cygnus cygnus_;
Trumpeter swan, _Cygnus buccinator_;
Whistling swan, _Cygnus columbianus_;
Bewick's swan, _Cygnus bewickii_;
Black swan, _Cygnus atratus_;
Black-necked swan, _Cygnus melancoryphus_;
Mute swan, _Cygnus olor_.
The mute swan is a common temperate Eurasian species, often
semi-domesticated; descendants of domestic flocks are naturalized in
the United States and elsewhere. See picture at
<http://pdubois.free.fr/oiseaux/images/CygnusOlor1.jpg>
Responding to our query re migration patterns of this species, the
following information has been received from Dr Reuven Yosef,
Director of the International Birding & Research Centre in Eilat,
Israel:
"This species is a sporadic migrant to northern Israel. No one has
ever tried to study or understand during which years and what
ecological pressures (at the summer grounds) force the Mute Swans to
come as far south as Israel".- Mod.AS]

The Hungarian authorities have informed the European Commission of
confirmed cases of the H5 avian influenza virus in 3 dead wild swans
[of which species?!] found in the county of Bacs-Kiskun, in Southern
Hungary.
Samples from the dead birds are now being sent to the Community
Reference Laboratory in Weybridge [UK] for further tests to determine
whether this is the H5N1 strain.
The Hungarian authorities are applying the same precautionary
measures as other Member States in which the H5N1 virus has been
confirmed (Greece, Italy, Germany) or in which it is suspected
(Slovenia, Austria) in wild birds [As reported in a separate section,
H5N1 has been already confirmed in Slovenia].
The Commission will adopt a Decision at 1700 today on the
precautionary measures to be applied in Hungary, just as it did for
the other affected Member States. The precautionary measures include
the establishment of a 3-km protection zone around the area where the
swans were found and a surrounding surveillance zone of 10 km. In the
protection zone, poultry must be kept indoors, movement of poultry is
banned except directly to the slaughterhouse, and the dispatch of
meat outside the zone is forbidden except under very limited
conditions. In both the protection and surveillance zones, on-farm
biosecurity measures must be strengthened, and hunting of wild birds
is banned.
Disease awareness-raising activities for poultry owners and their
families must be carried out.
The avian influenza situation in all affected countries is being
reviewed by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal
Health, which is meeting today and tomorrow [16 and 17 Feb 2006].

[In view of several inaccurate news-wires on dates of sample dispatch to
reference laboratories and the expected results, we have approached the EU
Reference Laboratory in Weybridge [UK] for their information. The following
first-hand data were kindly and expediently provided today (16 Feb 2006) by the
laboratory's Director, Dr Ian Brown:
"Slovenia - tests completed, reports being issued;
Greece - further samples from 2 swans, H5 confirmed, tests in progress;
Germany - samples arrived today;
Azerbaijan - tests still in progress on materials received from poultry;
Hungary - samples expected tomorrow;
Austria - samples just received.
Dr Brown's commendable contribution to transparency is very much
appreciated. - Mod.AS]
