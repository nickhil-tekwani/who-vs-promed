One of the world's most baffling diseases may be spread by the wind. A new study has found that Kawasaki disease, which sickens 12 000 children a year in Japan and occurs in other countries including the USA and South Korea, is at its deadliest when the wind blows from northeastern China. The findings suggest that the illness may be caused by an airborne toxin from that region, but just which one remains unclear.

Kawasaki disease typically strikes children between 6 months and 5 years old. Common symptoms include fever, a blotchy red rash, and redness and sometimes peeling of the hands and feet. It can be treated with antibodies; untreated, it often leads to inflammation of the coronary arteries, sometimes causing aneurysms that can lead to internal bleeding or heart attacks. Some researchers believe Kawasaki to be an infection, but they have never identified the microbe responsible; others suggest it's an immune response to an unidentified toxin.

In previous research, mathematical ecologist Xavier Rodo and colleagues at the Catalan Institute for Climate Sciences in Barcelona, Spain, had suggested that seasons with large numbers of Kawasaki cases in both Japan and the USA coincide with times when the prevailing winds come from Central Asia. In the new work, they investigated that idea further.

The researchers examined health records from 1970 to 2010 in each of Japan's 47 administrative divisions. They looked at the days on which the most cases were identified in Tokyo and other major cities, and used computer models of airflow to find out where the air had come from in the previous few days. Because the incubation period for Kawasaki disease is unknown, the team looked at various lag times.

On the days most children became ill, tropospheric winds from northeastern China carry the etiologic agent of Kawasaki disease from its source to Japan, usually about 2 days before reaching Japan and 2.5 days before the children came down with symptoms, the team reports online today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This suggests, the researchers say, that the disease is borne on the wind and that it has an incubation period of only about a half-day.

They also looked at the possibility that the disease could be an infection spreading between children. However, in all the major cities, most children fell ill on the same days, and the infection peak in all cities died away as soon as the wind changed direction, which would be hard to explain if the children were infecting each other. "It must be in the form of a toxin or some other environmental agent," Rodo says. His team also found no relationship with days of high levels of pollen or common pollutants such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides.

The region implicated, the Northeast China Plain, is highly agricultural, so the researchers suggest that a toxin produced by a fungus living on the crops is a likely culprit. They conducted several flights from Japan to northeastern China (the opposite direction of the prevailing winds) and filtered the air they collected. They found many species of _Candida_, a yeast responsible for common human infections and also for symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease in some strains of mice. However, the researchers do not claim to have identified the exact cause of Kawasaki disease, and they are hoping to conduct more flights. They also plan to look in more detail at the cause of the disease in the USA.

"I think these authors have presented a dataset that is pretty conclusive that this is most likely a microbial toxin of some type," says environmental microbiologist Dale Griffin of the US Geological Survey in St. Petersburg, Florida. He notes that the techniques of tracking airflow back to a common origin are well established in environmental sciences.

Anne Rowley, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, Illinois, says the work is "very interesting" but she remains skeptical about the windborne toxin hypothesis, which, she says, would be unprecedented for a human disease. She notes that a number of diseases, including AIDS and polio, were attributed to unidentified toxins shortly before infectious agents were identified.

Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2014 May 19. pii: 201400380. [Epub ahead of print]. It presents quite an interesting hypothesis that is far from proven, especially when one uses the quite short incubation it appears to require (less than 24 hours). Because of this, the authors postulate a toxin, and given the multisystem disease and degree of immune stimulation, it likely has properties of a super antigen. Rodo et al's previous paper that is mentioned is Rodo X, Ballester J, Cayan D, et al: Association of Kawasaki disease with tropospheric wind patterns. Sci Rep 1, 152; doi:10.1038/srep00152(2011).

_Candida_ as a potential trigger in a presumably immunologically susceptible cohort is suggested by a murine model for Kawasaki's disease in certain inbred strains of mice (1). Intraperitoneal administration of CAWS (water-soluble extra cellular polysaccharide fraction obtained from a culture supernatant of _Candida albicans_) induced a coronary arteritis. The degree of coronary arthritis, seen most significantly in DBA/2 mice seemed by correlate with high levels of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (2). The vasa vasorum of the coronary arteries seemed to be a primary site for the process (3). Just how relevant this murine model is for human Kawasaki disease is still unclear, but it has been reported that children with Kawasaki's disease have higher antibody titers to _Candida_ cell wall beta-glucan than normal children (4).
