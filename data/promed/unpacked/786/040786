BLUETONGUE IN KOSOVO (FRY), TERRITORY UNDER UNITED NATIONS INTERIM
ADMINISTRATION
Emergency report
Report received on 10 Oct 2001 from the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Rome, Italy:
The FAO received the following information from the Veterinary Services of
the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK)/Joint
Interim Administrative Structure (JIAS):
Outbreaks:
Location / Date of suspicion / Date of confirmation / Number
Jazince village, Strpce district / 23/08/01 / 13/09/01 / 1
Vrebestica village, Strpce district / 29/08/01 / 13/09/01 / 1
Recice village, Podujevo district / 30/08/01 / pending / 1
Slatina village, Podujevo district / 30/08/01 / pending / 1
Korotiza village, Glogovac district / 12/09/01 / pending / 1
Sadovina village, Vitina district / 12/09/01 / pending / 1
Diagnosis:
The veterinary officers of the UNMIL/JIAS inspected the suspected flocks
and collected blood and serum samples. The latter were sent by airfreight
within 24 hours to the Official World Reference Laboratory for bluetongue
in Pirbright (United Kingdom).
Control measures:
The UNMIK/JIAS Veterinary Services have ear-tagged the suspected and
infected animals and notified the flock owners to ban the movement of all
their susceptible animals.
An executive decision is in preparation to officially ban animal movement
from the affected areas in Kosovo, the export of all live ruminants from
Kosovo, and imports from neighbouring countries/zones.
Actual implementation of the movement ban cannot be enforced at present, as
Kosovo is lacking the complex control systems required. These systems are
currently being put in place under the UNMIK/JIAS Kosovo Veterinary Service
strategy plan 2001-2003.
The Veterinary Services will inform animal owners in the 30 municipalities
of the outbreaks and movement ban, indicating the risks involved in
purchasing animals from the infected areas.
Culling of infected animals is also not a viable option at present given
the existing budgetary constraints. However, the outbreaks should be
limited by the climatic conditions, given the susceptibility of the insect
vectors to cold temperatures.
The Veterinary Services will initiate a mass vaccination campaign in spring
2002 to control the recurrence of the disease as part of a longer-term
containment and eradication campaign.

[Bluetongue is an orbivirus spread by _Culicoides_ species, i.e., biting
midges or gnats. It is also spread from dam to fetus or by contaminated
syringes. Outbreaks from countries in the region recently include Greece,
Bulgaria, Macedonia, and now Kosovo (see references above). Anyone with
insight into epidemiologic factors (e.g., vector density) that may explain
the apparent increase may want to let us know. - Mod.PC
