[A summary of the the disease was provided by Mod. AS in Equine infectious anemia: UK ex Romania 20100121.023 as part of an interesting and extensive comment. It is copied below:

"Infectious equine anaemia (EIA) or "swamp fever" is a virus disease of horses causing intermittent fever, anaemia, emaciation, and death. It can be transmitted by mechanical transfer of blood by biting insects and occurs typically in low-lying swampy areas. The disease was 1st described in France in 1843. The term "swamp fever" was 1st used by Torrance in 1903 in Canada, where this disease had been known before 1882. Although the infectious nature of this disease had long been suspected, a viral case was not definitely established until 1904. The virus was classified as a retrovirus in 1976 and later grouped with the lentiviruses (that is, non-tumour forming exogenous retroviruses) of which the human AIDS virus is also a member. As in other lentivirus infections, animals remain infected for life. EIA has a worldwide distribution. Early in the 20th century serious outbreaks occurred in France, Japan, and America. During the decade 1980 to 1989 the disease was reported in many parts of America, Asia (India, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand), Europe (Austria, France, Greece, Italy, Romania, USSR, and Yugoslavia), and Australia."

Since that posting between 2010 and the beginning of 2012, countries in Europe have continued to have problems with outbreaks of EIA and include the following according to the OIE WAHID database:

Belgium 7 outbreaks
Bosnia and Herzegovina
Croatia 8 outbreaks
France
Germany 30 outbreaks
Greece
Hungary 21 outbreaks
Italy 182 outbreaks
Latvia
Romania (epicenter) 3780 outbreaks
Russia 105 outbreaks
Serbia
Slovenia
United Kingdom 3 outbreaks
