"Fishy" mackerel taken off shelves
-----------------------------------
Frozen mackerel with high levels of histamine -- which caused an
allergic reaction in some customers who ate it -- has been identified
by the Health Ministry. The Ministry received a complaint from
someone who developed itching and a red face after eating mackerel
marketed by Yosef Melech Hadagim company (YMH Mehadrin) of Ashdod.
A lab found illegally high levels of histamine and warned the public
not to eat this type of fish from the Ashdod company with a
manufacturing date of Dec 2004 and a last date for sale of Oct 2005.
Inspectors instructed the company to collect the remaining fish from
store shelves. High levels of histamine can cause a drop in blood
pressure, itching of the skin, headaches, a burning sensation in the
mouth, redness in the face and even nausea, diarrhea or vomiting.

[The illness described here is certainly suggestive of scombroid,
also called histamine fish poisoning. Unlike many types of fish or
shellfish-related food poisoning, scombroid is not related to toxins
coming up through the food chain from dinoflagellates. It occurs
from the decarboxylation of histidine in the fish flesh into
histamine by contaminating bacteria, which is facilitated by
inadequate refrigeration. The incubation period is from 5 minutes to
an hour and the poisoning is generally gone within several hours. It
is not seasonal. Although the report refers to an allergic reaction,
scombroid is not an allergic reaction to the fish but rather the
ingestion of a mediator of allergy, histamine, produced in the fish.
