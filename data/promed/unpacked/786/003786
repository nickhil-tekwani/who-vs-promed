A recent outbreak of hand-foot-mouth disease, first recorded at Lakeland Union High School [LUHS, Minocqua, Wisconsin] last month [September 2015], has spread to 2 area elementary schools. An AV-W [Arbor Vitae Woodruff Elem School] nurse released a statement Friday morning [16 Oct 2015] notifying parents that there has been one documented case of the disease at the school. 2 days earlier, another MHLT [Minocqua-Hazelhurst-Lake Tomahawk Elementary School] nurse notified parents that there were 9 recorded cases at the Minocqua elementary school.

Since the beginning of the 2015-16 school year, Lakeland Union High School has experienced at least 12 documented cases of hand-foot-mouth disease. Last week [week of 12 Oct 2015], a LUHS administrator sent out a notification encouraging students and faculty to take preventative measures. In their notifications to parents, the practice nurses urged elementary students and staff to do likewise. "Anyone can get HFMD but it is primarily found in young children," they wrote.

The disease is caused by [a coxsackievirus]. Symptoms include severe sore throat, fever, nausea with or without vomiting, excessive tiredness, and blister-type sores in the mouth which may also appear on the hands and feet. The virus is primarily spread through direct contact with feces, mucus, and saliva. The virus has also been found in the fluid of the skin blisters.

Transmissions of this disease can be minimized by instructing individuals to take the following precautions: practice good hand washing with soap and water throughout the day, especially before and after meals and using the bathroom; disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as toys and doorknobs; do no not share any items such as water bottles with anyone; stay away from those who are sick until their fever is gone.
