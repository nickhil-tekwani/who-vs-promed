CDC is collaborating with public health officials in many states and the FDA to investigate an outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Saintpaul infections linked to imported cucumbers supplied by Daniel Cardenas Izabal and Miracle Greenhouse of Culiacan, Mexico and distributed by Tricar Sales, Inc. of Rio Rico, Arizona.

Public health investigators are using the PulseNet system to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. In PulseNet, the national subtyping network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories coordinated by CDC, DNA "fingerprints" of salmonella bacteria are obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak.

A total of 73 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Saintpaul have been reported from 18 states. The number of ill persons identified in each state is as follows: Arizona (9), California (28), Colorado (1), Idaho (2), Illinois (3), Louisiana (1), Massachusetts (1), Maryland (1), Minnesota (8), Nevada (1), New Mexico (2), North Carolina (1), Ohio (1), Oregon (2), South Dakota (2), Texas (6), Virginia (2), and Wisconsin (2).

Among persons for whom information was available, illness onset dates range from 12 Jan 2013 to 6 Apr 2013. Ill persons range in age from less than one year to 80 years, with a median age of 23 years. 60 percent of ill persons are female. Among 51 persons with available information, 14 (27 percent) ill persons have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Preliminary epidemiologic, laboratory, and trace-back investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that exposure to imported cucumbers supplied by Daniel Cardenas Izabal and Miracle Greenhouse of Culiacan, Mexico and distributed by Tricar Sales, Inc. of Rio Rico, Arizona are the likely source of this outbreak of _S._ Saintpaul infections.

In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods eaten and other exposures during the week before becoming ill. 30 (67 percent) of 45 ill persons interviewed reported eating various types of cucumbers purchased or consumed at multiple locations or restaurants. This proportion is significantly higher than results from a survey of healthy persons in which 44 percent reported eating cucumbers in the 7 days before they were interviewed. An additional 5 (11 percent) of 45 ill persons reported that they may have eaten cucumbers. No other foods that were reported eaten by interviewees were associated with illness.

Reviewing shipping records, with assistance from its partner state agencies, FDA traced cucumbers eaten by 6 ill people to the distributor, Tricar Sales, Inc., and further, to the suppliers, Daniel Cardenas Izabal and Miracle Greenhouse. On 24 Apr 2013, the suppliers were placed on Import Alert. Cucumbers from these 2 firms will be denied admission into the USA unless the suppliers show that they are not contaminated with salmonella.

The number of illnesses reported has declined substantially since a peak in early March 2013. Currently, there is no evidence that contaminated cucumbers are still on the market. However, due to the time it takes between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported, additional ill persons may be identified. CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill.

[ProMED awaits more information regarding the scope of this outbreak linked to cucumbers imported from Mexico. Most cucumbers, although eaten without cooking, are peeled prior to slicing. It is possible, as it is with other organisms, that the salmonellae were able to enter and replicate in the cucumber and did not exist solely on the surface. - Mod.LL]
