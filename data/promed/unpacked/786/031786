The state veterinarian has announced that several horses returning from out-of-state events have been sickened by equine influenza virus (EIV) in Tennessee. Equine influenza is highly contagious, and the virus is spread by contaminated stable equipment and infected coughing horses. Signs in horses may include fever, nasal discharge, cough, loss of appetite, and weakness. Sick horses cannot directly infect people with EIV.

"With EIV, it is much easier for horse owners to take preventive measures than to provide treatment," Interim State Veterinarian Dr. Doug Balthaser said. "Maintaining hygiene procedures with stable equipment and vaccinating your horses is a great start for prevention efforts. Your veterinarian can help you decide the best vaccination plan for your horse."

Other tips include:

- Isolate newly introduced horses or horses returning from events for 2 weeks.
- For events or stables, restrict entry to healthy horses only.
- Don't share equipment or supplies between horses, especially if one spikes a fever, has nasal discharge, or is coughing.

The C.E. Kord Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory now offers a full line of equine disease testing, including West Nile virus, equine infectious anemia (EIA), equine herpesvirus (EHV), equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and EIV. Contact a veterinarian for more information.

[Equine influenza is highly contagious and spreads rapidly among naive horses. Horses 1 to 5 years of age are the most susceptible to infection. Orthomyxovirus A/equine-2 was 1st recognized in 1963 as a cause of widespread epidemics and has subsequently become endemic in many countries, except for New Zealand and Iceland. China, Japan, and Australia experienced devastating epidemics of equine influenza affecting tens of thousands of horses in 2007. Before that, equine influenza had not been reported in China since 1993 and in Japan since 1972, and it had never been reported in Australia.

Endemicity is maintained by sporadic clinical cases and by inapparent infection in susceptible horses introduced into the population by birth, through waning immunity, or after movement from other areas or countries. A carrier state is not recognized for equine influenza. The clinical outcome after viral exposure largely depends on immune status; clinical disease varies from a mild inapparent infection to severe disease in susceptible animals. Influenza is rarely fatal except in donkeys, zebras, and debilitated horses. Transmission occurs by inhalation of respiratory secretions. Epidemics arise when one or more acutely infected horses are introduced into a susceptible group. The epidemiologic outcome depends on the antigenic characteristics of the circulating virus and the immune status of a given population of horses at time of exposure. Frequent natural exposure or regular vaccination may contribute to the degree of antigenic drift seen with specific strains of A/equine-2 virus in some parts of the world.
