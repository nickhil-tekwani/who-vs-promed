Human infection with avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses; associated animal health events
-----------------------------------------------------
From 2003 through 17 Dec 2012, 610 laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection have been officially reported to WHO from 15 countries, of whom 360 have died.

Since January 2012, 32 human cases of influenza A(H5N1) virus infection have been reported to WHO.

Since the last update on 5 Nov 2012, 2 new laboratory-confirmed human cases with influenza A(H5N1) virus infection were reported to WHO, one from Egypt and the other a fatal case from Indonesia.

Table: Laboratory-confirmed human cases with avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection reported between 5 Nov and 17 Dec 2012

Country / Province / Age(y) / Sex / Onset* / Hospitalisation* / Death* / Exposure

Egypt / Demietta governorate / 2 / F / 3 Dec 2012 / 1 Dec 2012 / surviving / backyard poultry (chicken and ducks)

Indonesia / West Java / 4 / M / 30 Nov 2012 / 5 Dec 2012 / 6 Dec 2012 / poultry (duck) in neighbourhood)

* dates thereof

Comment: based on previous years' observations, an increase in reported H5N1 influenza events in poultry is expected for this time of year. Sporadic human cases reported this month [December 2012] in countries with known influenza A(H5N1) virus activity in poultry are within the expected range. No onward sustained human to human transmission was reported.

Public health risk assessment of avian influenza A(H5N1) viruses: the public health risk remains unchanged.
