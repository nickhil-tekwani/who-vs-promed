If my memory serves, the vampire bats were not necessarily captured,
smeared with anticoagulant, and released, presumably to return to their
roost where mutual grooming would kill additional bats, as well as the
original captive. Instead, coagulants were applied in petroleum jelly, or
something similar, to the backs of cattle. Bats attacking or landing on the
cattle would acquire the coagulant, ingesting it during subsequent
grooming. Or perhaps that was an experimental approach that did not pan
out. Judging only from the vampire bat roosts I saw in Panama, I don't
believe vampire bats are as social as many of the insectivorous species, so
the cattle application might be more effective, if it worked.20
