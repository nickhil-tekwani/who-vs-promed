Increasing number of _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria cases in Madagascar
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Between January and the end of May [2015] the malaria epidemic hit 212 923 people; 187 deaths are recorded in health facilities in the country; 31 districts had their positivity rate increase during the epidemiological season.

Dr Arsene Ratsimbasoa, Director NMCP [National Malaria Control Program] explains: "remoteness of areas causing difficulty to the supply of medicines, lack of sanitary training forcing villagers to treat the disease their own way, and inadequate medication for a period, exploded malaria in some localities. The Atsimo-Andrefana region stands out, because the rate of positivity there reached 70 percent."

The official said 4 regions remain vulnerable to the epidemic of malaria, and are monitored in particular. These are the regions Atsimo-Andrefana, Atsimo-Atsinanana, Melaky, and Analamanga.

Actions like the campaign of indoor residual spraying (Caid) [French acronym] and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) are carried out in these localities.

For the Analamanga region, the epidemic is far from eradicated. Indeed, entomological monitoring by the Ministry of Health and its partners, such as the Pasteur Institute Madagascar, has identified 2 indigenous malaria-carrying mosquitoes, _Anopheles gambiae_ and _A. funestus_.

A NMCP technician notes that these mosquitoes survive in the capital in any season, while cases of autochthonous [contracted locally] malaria recorded in the capital and in the district of Ambohidratrimo rise to 87. Officials have, however, refrained from mentioning the number of deaths from autochthonous malaria in the highlands.

Apart from Caid, the NMCP counts on epidemiological monitoring to prevent the spread of the epidemic. "Autochthonous malaria survives in Analamanga region. To deal with the situation, we conducted spraying of households and their surrounds. The insecticide lasts 6 months. In case this does not bring the expected results, we are preparing the response," concluded Dr Arsene Ratsimbasoa.

Until the next epidemiological season, 1 633 776 doses of ACT drugs (artemisinin-based combination therapies) and 2 million rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are expected in August [2015].

[The epidemic of malaria increases in the Big Island. If mosquitoes are found infected, the disease may be endemic in the country and malaria cases could be observed in any period of the year. Malaria remains a major public health problem, despite the financial resources put into research and the fight against the disease. Note that so far there is no vaccine on the market against the disease.

Current strategies can significantly reduce the disease, among others indoor spraying, use of ITNs with long-lasting insecticide (LLIN), early diagnosis by rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), effective and well tolerated treatment with ACT. Some endemic countries, under the leadership of WHO have started eradication programs with the measures mentioned above combined with epidemiological monitoring and anti-gametocyte treatment (against the sexual part of the parasite's life cycle) with primaquine.

The WHO World Malaria Report for 2014 (http://www.who.int/malaria/publications/world_malaria_report_2014/wmr-2014-profiles.pdf) estimates that 30 percent of the population in Madagascar lives in highly malaria endemic areas and 70 percent in low endemic areas. In 2014, 387 045 cases were reported with 641 fatalities. Admissions were low in 2012 (below 32 cases per 100 000 population) but has increased since, and was in 2014 close to 48 cases per 100 000 population (WHO reference above).

The WHO World Malaria Report for 2014 also estimate that less than 40 percent of households are protected by insecticide treated nets (ITN), and less than 50 percent of cases received treatment with an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). - Mod.EP]
