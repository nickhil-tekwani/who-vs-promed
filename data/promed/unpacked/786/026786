Control measures
Measures applied: No vaccination; No treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute (AFBI), Vet Sciences Division, Stormont (National laboratory) / Birds / bacteriological examination / 9 Sep 2013 / Positive

[Fowl typhoid in chickens and turkeys is caused by _Salmonella gallinarum_ biovar gallinarum and is more often observed in the later growing period and in mature stock. Disease is often characterised by rapid spread with high morbidity and acute or subacute mortality. Red mites may be involved in the transmission of disease and persistence in poultry houses.

Clinical signs of fowl typhoid are typical of a septicaemic condition in poultry and include increased mortality and poor quality in chicks hatched from infected eggs. Older birds show signs of anaemia, depression, labored breathing and diarrhoea causing adherence of faeces to the vent.

For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, and references, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2013, Chapter 2.3.11, Fowl typhoid and pullorum disease, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.11_FOWL_TYPHOID.pdf (version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2012).

OIE's internationally agreed upon requirements pertaining to fowl typhoid and pullorum disease are spelled out in chapter 10.7. of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code, available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_1.10.7.htm.

Like other infectious diseases of poultry, prevention and control of fowl typhoid relies on the maintenance of high biosecurity and hygiene standards. Therefore, taking steps to prevent the introduction and spread of infection, and the prompt investigation and diagnosis of suspect disease are advised to both minimise the risk of bringing in the disease and the impact of an outbreak. It is therefore important to consider the risk associated with movements onto poultry premises of birds and chicks (including fancy breeds), hatching eggs and table eggs and associated equipment (e.g., egg trays, crates, etc.) from areas where _Salmonella gallinarum_ infection is present (http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla-en/disease-control/non-notifiable/fowl-typhoid/).

_Salmonella gallinarum_ is highly host adapted, and it is not considered to be a serious public health concern. In one survey, only 8 out of more than 450 000 isolations of _Salmonella_ from humans were _Salmonella gallinarum_. _Salmonella pullorum_ occasionally causes acute, self-limiting enteritis in people who eat massively contaminated food (http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/fowl_typhoid.pdf).

In 2012, 2 outbreaks of fowl typhoid were reported in Northern Ireland. That particular event was resolved on 27 Nov 2012. See ProMED-mail post 20121119.1415846.

Fowl typhoid is not a notifiable disease in the United Kingdom http://www.defra.gov.uk/ahvla-en/disease-control/non-notifiable/fowl-typhoid/; however, as an OIE Member, and the disease being notifiable, DEFRA does report it to the OIE.

According to information found in the immediate notification report, the event was confirmed on 9 Sep 2013 and resolved on 12 Sep 2013, but was reported to the OIE in mid-November 2013. - Mod.CRD
