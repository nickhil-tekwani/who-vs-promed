A few thoughts regarding the current outbreak of severe illness among gold
miners:
A study published in 2003 found that seropositivity to Marburg virus in
Congo DR was associated with working in local gold mines (1). Nevertheless,
as the moderator points out, the low case-fatality rate in this outbreak is
not consistent with Marburg virus infection. Outbreaks of leptospirosis and
Ebola have also been described in areas of gold mining activity (2).
Elemental mercury is used in some gold mining sites for purposes of
amalgamation and extraction (3). Acute exposure to mercury is associated
with severe illness, bloody diarrhea and, if mercury vapors are involved,
fever with pneumonia. Mercury poisoning is both preventable and treatable,
and this possibility must be considered.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Berger for reminding us of the
possibility of mercury poisoning. In an earlier discussion of an outbreak
of hemorrhagic fever in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (see ref below
19990523.0850), there was a discussion of possible toxic exposures that
could explain the outbreak (which ultimately was confirmed as due to
Marburg virus). We await more information on the etiology of these deaths,
and the outbreak (or outbreaks should there be more than one etiology
identified). - Mod.MPP]
