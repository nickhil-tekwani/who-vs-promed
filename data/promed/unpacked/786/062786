Pigs identified as possible vector for Hendra virus
---------------------------------------------------
Pigs are susceptible to the deadly Hendra virus and could potentially
transmit it to humans, Canadian researchers have discovered.

The virus occurs only in Australia and is carried by native fruit
bats. However, horses can catch the virus, most probably from
ingesting secretions from infected bats.

There have been 7 cases where the virus has been transferred from
horses to people, 4 of which proved fatal.

The 2 most recent fatalities involved equine veterinarians.

The research in Canada has shown that pigs are susceptible to the
virus. Two Landrace pigs, commonly used in the pork industry, and 5
Gottingen minipigs were inoculated with the virus, as well as half a
dozen guinea pigs, 2 of which died.

All test animals developed fever and depression. One of the 2 Landrace
pigs developed respiratory signs after 5 days and 1 of the Gottingen
minipigs developed not only respiratory signs but also mild
neurological signs. Virus was detected in all infected pigs at 2-5 days.

Clinical signs in the 2 infected Landrace pigs were more severe
compared to those observed in minipigs, the authors said. The Landrace
pigs were very sick at 5 days, with 1 developing severe depression,
respiratory distress, and possible neurological signs, requiring
euthanasia.

"Since infected pigs may shed virus through oral, nasal, and rectal
excretions, possible transmission through close contact with these
excretions may occur," the authors said. "This new finding indicates
that pigs are susceptible to Hendra virus infections and could
potentially play a role as an intermediate host in transmission to
humans."

The authors noted that a serological survey of 100 swine herds in
Queensland had found no antibodies against Hendra virus among 500
samples. "Lack of evidence for Hendra infection in domestic swine
stresses the importance of heightened on-farm biosecurity," they said.

"However, our findings may reinforce the concern about Hendra virus
infecting feral pigs if they are forced to share the same habitat as
fruit bats. This concern is based on the fact that Australia has over
23 million feral pigs living in Queensland, New South Wales, and the
Northern Territory, according to reports by Animal Control
Technologies."

The virus was first identified in 1994 as the cause of respiratory
illnesses in 13 horses and 2 people in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra.
The 1st fatality was a horse trainer.

[These pigs were injected with the virus, but the real question is
whether they are susceptible by inhalation or ingestion of the virus?
It is possible to transmit many diseases through direct inoculation
that may not transfer in the real world.

This novel work shows pigs are clearly susceptible, but their role in
transmission of the disease has not been proven by this work, only
theorized. If the work is repeated hopefully the diligent researchers
will take the next step and place non-infected pigs into the same
locality and see if there is natural transmission. - Mod.TG]
