Wheat streak mosaic and curl mites raise concerns
-------------------------------------------------
Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) has been detected in early planted
winter wheat and concern has arisen about this disease in volunteer
spring wheat, according to Marcia McMullen and Joel Ransom, North
Dakota State University (NDSU).

Most spring wheat volunteers may have germinated late enough to have
broken the green bridge necessary for the survival of the wheat curl
mite, which transmits WSMV. Although no evidence of disease has been
found in these volunteers, they should be destroyed prior to planting
another wheat crop.

Symptoms of WSMV have been observed in Minot in early planted winter
wheat [5 Sep 2009] "These fields probably were infected last fall
[2009] and the warm weather has increased mite development and virus
spread," McMullen says. "Later planted winter wheat [25 Sep 2009] in
the same area appears symptomless at this time." Growers with
symptomatic winter wheat still have time to plant another crop.

The risk of mite dispersal and virus spread from an infected field
tends to follow an oval-shaped pattern according to the prevailing
winds. Research suggests possible movement of up to 2 miles [3.2 km],
depending on mite numbers in source fields. "Spraying glyphosate
stimulates mites to seek a new, healthy crop," Ransom says. "The best
scenario for adjacent crops would be cooler temperatures and good
rainfall," McMullen says.

Oklahoma
--------
A disease with widespread incidence is barley yellow dwarf (BYD).
Many fields show areas with flag leaf discoloration consistent with
BYD. However, there usually was no or only little stunting associated
with this discoloration indicating that infection most likely
occurred in the spring rather than in the fall.

Arkansas
--------
Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) appears to be widespread, but it is too
early to estimate its impact on yield across the state. Plants with
stiff, upright, yellow (or purple) leaves likely are affected by BYD.
Plants with noticeable stunting likely will have a significant yield
and test weight loss compared to nearby healthy plants. Nothing can
be done about BYD now.

[Wheat streak mosaic
--------------------
_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_) is prevalent
in North America, Russia, Eastern Europe, and has also been reported
from Australia and Argentina. It can infect wheat, maize (some
cultivars), grasses, and also oats and barley in experimental
inoculations. Heavy WSMV infection can cause complete crop failure in
wheat. The virus is spread by the wheat curl mite _Aceria tulipae_.
Larvae acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants and remain
infectious for approximately a week. The virus is not transmitted
congenitally to the progeny of the vector. WSMV can also be
mechanically transmitted and seed transmitted at a low level. Control
of the mite vector is difficult but disease management may include
controlling volunteer wheat and grassy weeds to minimise inoculum.

An increase in WSMV incidence was reported from North Dakota in late
2009 (ProMED-mail post 20090907.3148) with associated risk of
inoculum via volunteer crops and grasses ("green bridge") for the 2010 crops.

Barley yellow dwarf
-------------------
Barley yellow dwarf (BYD) occurs worldwide and is the most
destructive of virus diseases of wheat. Grain yields may be reduced
by one third. It attacks a wide range of grass species (_Gramineae_)
including wheat, oats, rice, maize, rye, and barley. Oats are usually
considered more susceptible than wheat. Symptoms include leaf
discolouration from yellow to purple (depending on the host species),
stunting, reduced tillering, and empty seed heads. Plants infected in
autumn may not survive the winter or show severe symptoms when growth
resumes. Diseased plants often occur in circular patches within the
field, which are associated with colonisation by the aphid vectors.

BYD viruses have now been split into several species in the family
_Luteoviridae_ (mostly in the genus _Luteovirus_) and are
differentiated by their ability to be transmitted by various aphid
species and their virulence on a selected variety of oats. Some of
the viruses are transmitted equally well by several aphids, whereas
others can be transmitted by only one or 2 species. They cannot be
transmitted by seed, pollen, or mechanical means and cannot survive
in stubble or in the soil. Volunteer cereal plants or grassy weeds
may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management includes use of
resistant cultivars and control of the aphid vectors.
