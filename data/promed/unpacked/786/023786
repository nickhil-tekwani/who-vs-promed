The article about a _Salmonella_ outbreak in Mallorca prompted Antonia
Galmes of the Conselleria de Sanitat i Consum, Illes Balears, Spain to
respond with two concerns. The first concern was that epidemiological
information about cases diagnosed in the United Kingdom was published
swiftly rather than being delayed until information had been requested
'through the established routes'. The second was that some of the data had
been incorrectly described.
The article said that _Salmonella enteritidis_ phage type 1 had been
isolated from 284 guests of a particular hotel, and that 224 of the strains
were resistant to nalidixic acid. Dr Galmes made the point that all the
cases in an outbreak should belong to the same strain and also noted that
the 284 isolates were not all from travellers to Mallorca, as the article
implied, but were the total number of _S. enteritidis_ PT1 isolates
identified by the PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens in June 1998. The
local authorities were aware of 98 cases, reported by hospitals in Mallorca
and by German health authorities. Dr Galmes concluded that this was an
example of how European surveillance should not be conducted, as the first
goal of epidemiological surveillance was to investigate in order to
implement control measures, rather than to publish articles about it.
As editor of Eurosurveillance Weekly I must apologise for the publication
of factual errors. The latest figures from the PHLS Laboratory of Enteric
Pathogens, which refer to strains isolated in England and Wales, indicate
that a total of 132 isolates of _S. enteritidis_ PT1 have been made from
people who have travelled to Mallorca since the end of May 1998, 121 of
which are resistant to nalidixic acid. The data refer to patients who
stayed at various hotels and resorts, not only the one mentioned last week.
In terms of whether we are right in general to report the information
available on outbreaks as they arise, I believe that this is the
fundamental reason for the existence of Eurosurveillance Weekly. The aim is
not to subvert the activities of local or national surveillance systems,
but to augment them. International travel and trade provide opportunities
for international spread of communicable diseases. By providing a forum for
sharing information between public health professionals throughout Europe,
Eurosurveillance Weekly has the potential to improve case ascertainment and
assist in the collection of information needed to identify the sources and
vehicles of infection, with the result that control measures may be
implemented with greater speed and effectiveness. It does represent a
change from established patterns of working.
To make use of Eurosurveillance Weekly requires a degree of openness, for
which people have to trust that the provision of information is intended
for the public good. This is a fundamental tenet of total quality
management - problems should not be covered up; they should be acknowledged
frankly, discussed openly, and their causes investigated and dealt with
appropriately. 'Every defect is a treasure', because it means that the
surveillance system is functioning to pick it up, and the opportunity
exists to put it right.
