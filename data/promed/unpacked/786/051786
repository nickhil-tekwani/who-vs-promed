Sarawak is experiencing a "2nd wave" of the hand, foot and mouth disease
(HFMD), with a steady increase in the number of new cases reported since
May 2006. Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Dr George Chan said 403 new cases
were reported last week compared to 315 and 253 cases in the preceding 2 weeks.
The outbreak had earlier shown a downward trend from the middle of March,
when it hit its peak of 1345 cases in a week, to early May with 156 cases
in a week. However, the number of cases has since started to rise again and
the state Health Department has intensified its HFMD control operations,
including active case detection, health education and closure of preschools
where necessary. Earlier this week, 2 kindergartens in Miri were issued
2-week closure orders.
Dr Chan said the "2nd wave" could be due to the increased movement of
people during the May state election and the Gawai holidays in June. [for
more information on Sarawak's Gawai Dayak festival at the beginning of
June, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gawai_Dayak>] "We're giving people
the same advice as before, observe good hygiene and avoid bringing young
children to crowded places. "Also, we will ask preschools and kindergartens
to close if we find 2 or more cases in their premises," he told a press
conference here Friday [14 Jul 2006].
He added that the government would not be issuing a blanket closure order
at the moment because the number of serious cases was still low. "We will
be watching the situation very carefully. If there are a lot of serious
cases, or if the graph goes up very sharply and the disease is spreading
rapidly, we will consider closing all the kindergartens," he said.
Meanwhile, 66 new cases were reported in the state on Fri [14 Jul 2006],
with 10 children admitted to hospital. Kuching division had the highest
number of cases with 20 affected children. Other places with new reported
cases included Bintulu (10) and Mukah and Sibu with 8 each. The total
number of cases now stands at 11 935.

[Neither this nor the previous report indicates the identity of the
etiologic agent. HFMD is normally a benign disease of young children, but
historically there have been outbreaks of severe disease in Malaysia
associated with the prevalence of enterovirus 71. ProMED-mail would welcome
information on the identity of the virus responsible for this escalating
outbreak.
