African swine fever in Burkina Faso
-----------------------------------
See also: 19 Sep 2003, 29 Aug 2003
Translation of information received on (and dated) 24 Nov 2004 from Dr
Zacharie Compaore, director of veterinary services, Ministry of Animal
Resources, Ouagadougou:
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory
Date of suspicion: 24 Aug 2004
Date of confirmation of diagnosis: 17 Nov 2004
A single outbreak in Kadiogo Province, Ouagadougou district (in the central
part of the country)
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
sui / 149 000 / >800 / 601 / ... / ...
Diagnosis:
The diagnosis was made at Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute, South Africa.
On 8 Oct 2004, samples were sent to the laboratory; on 17 Nov 2004,
positive results were received. The delay in response is due to the fact
that the laboratory applied the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique
after obtaining negative results for antibody detection and after the
failure of 3 attempts at virus isolation on cell culture.
Epidemiology: the PCR identified genomic sequence is 99 per cent identical
to that of the virus isolated in the country in 2003 in Kompienga province.
Control measures:
- a decree notifying an outbreak of swine fever in Kadiogo province was
drawn up;
- instructions were sent to all regions to restrict the movements of swine;
- a census was made of swine farms for the purpose of cleaning and
disinfecting the affected farms (in progress);
- public awareness is being raised on the importance of respecting hygienic
measures.

[While we tend to see African swine fever more in East Africa, it is not
unknown in West Africa. Senegal had a "suspected" OIE report in September
of this year [2004] for which we are still awaiting confirmation.
ProMED-mail carried very detailed reports from Nigeria on an outbreak
killing over 50 000 pigs in 2001 (thanks to Dr Tayo Babalobi of the Vet
school at Ibadan), and Cameroon lost 75 per cent of the nation's pig
population in the late 1980s, according to personal communications from the
very knowledgeable Dr Fabian Ekue. - Mod.PC]
