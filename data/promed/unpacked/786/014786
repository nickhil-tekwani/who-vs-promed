Genetic studies show that the H5N1 avian influenza virus mutated multiple
times as it spread through an Indonesia family in May [2006], but the
significance of the changes is uncertain, according to a news report today
in Nature. The journal, basing its report on confidential genetic sequence
data, published a chart showing that a total of 32 mutations were
identified in viruses collected from 6 patients in the family case cluster.
Previous reports from the World Health Organization and other experts gave
the impression that only a few mutations had been found.
The case cluster in North Sumatra involved a 37-year-old woman who
apparently contracted the virus from poultry and then passed it to 6
relatives before she died. One of those 6, a 10-year-old boy, then passed
the virus to his father. WHO officials said in June 2006 that a specific
mutation found in the boy and his father marked the first laboratory
confirmation of human-to-human transmission of the virus.
On 23 May 2006, the WHO said genetic sequencing of 2 viruses from the case
cluster had shown "no evidence of genetic reassortment with human or pig
influenza viruses and no evidence of significant mutations." A month later,
at the end of an avian flu conference in Jakarta, WHO officials told
reporters the virus had mutated slightly when it infected the 10-year-old
boy, and the same mutation showed up in his father. The mutation didn't
make the virus more transmissible or virulent, officials said.
The genetic data obtained by Nature came from a presentation by University
of Hong Kong virologist Malik Peiris at a closed session of the Jakarta
meeting in June, the article says. The magazine says that 21 mutations were
identified in a virus from the father of the 10-year-old boy, involving 7
of the virus's 8 genes, suggesting that the virus was evolving rapidly as
it spread. In addition, from one to 4 mutations were found in viruses
collected from 5 other patients. The story says one of the mutations
confers resistance to the antiviral drug amantadine, a finding not reported
by the WHO.
However, the virus did not spread beyond the extended family, as the
article notes. "Many of the genetic changes did not result in the use of
different amino acids by the virus," the story says. "And there were no
amino-acid changes in key receptor binding sites known to affect
pathogenicity and transmissibility." According to the magazine, viruses
from 6 of the 8 cases in the cluster have been sequenced, but the WHO has
not shared the findings, saying they belong to Indonesia. The data have
been released only to a few researchers linked to the WHO and the US
Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention, the story says. Virologists
quoted by the journal asserted that the withholding of sequence data on
H5N1 is hindering scientists' understanding of the virus. But WHO staff
member Paul Gully replied, according to the article, that the agency's job
is investigating outbreaks, not doing academic research, and that labs
don't have the time or resources to do "high-quality sequencing" during
outbreaks.

[This report appears to be based on a commentary in the 'News' section of
'Nature' (Volume 442 Number 7099, dated 14 Jul 2006, page 114) by Declan
Butler, entitled "Family tragedy spotlights flu mutations : Human-to-human
transmission raises demand for DNA data". The original WHO statement
referred to in the above article was issued on 23 May 2006 and can be
viewed on the WHO website (URL below) and in ProMED-mail posts "Avian
influenza, human (72) - Indonesia, Iran 20060523.1455" and Avian influenza,
human (88) - China, Indonesia 20060622.1729.

The conclusion from these reports remains the same, namely that none of the
mutations observed (irrespective of their number) in the cluster suggest
that the H5N1 virus is evolving towards a highly transmissible pandemic
strain. Until the data are published in the open literature the reliability
of these conflicting sequence determinations will remain in doubt and the
authors should be prevailed upon to release their data in a scientifically
acceptable manner. - Mod.CP]

China's most recent human case of bird flu in south China's Guangdong
Province has been showing signs of recovery, sources with the local health
authorities said on Wed 21 Jun 2006. X-rays showed the shadow on the
patient's lungs had diminished, but he was still critically ill, said the
Health Bureau of Shenzhen City. The 31-year-old man was confirmed by the
Ministry of Health to have contracted bird flu on June 15, bringing China's
total human infections to 19. The man had been undergoing treatment for 8
days in a local hospital, which had the most advanced intensive care unit
in the city, said the bureau.
Meanwhile, medical observation of 98 people who had close contact with him
had found no suspected symptoms, such as pneumonia or bird flu-like
symptoms, said a statement from the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and
Prevention. Bird flu has killed 12 Chinese since 2005. The disease has also
infected 228 people and killed 130 worldwide, according to figures from the
World Health Organization (WHO).
Indonesian Health Minister Siti Sufari Fadillah announced Wednesday that
the investigation conducted by a WHO team on the world's largest cluster
death of bird flu cases in the country's North Sumatra province found the
virus was transmitted from animal to human, not from human to human. Seven
people in the same extended family died from the highly pathogenic H5N1
virus during June 2006, followed by the deaths of 2 siblings in Jakarta,
which the minister described as a cluster. It was the biggest reported
cluster of deaths, raising international concern on possible human
transmission in Indonesia. Senior Chinese health expert Shu Yuelong said
Wednesday there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission in China,
but warned the evolution of the virus was unpredictable. No trace of human
influenza had been found in the gene of the virus extracted from Chinese
bird flu patients either, said Shu, director of the National Influenza
Center under the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Hong Kong's health chief, York Chow, said on 16 Jun 2006 that the latest
human case of bird flu on the Chinese mainland might indicate the virus had
mutated and become as infectious in summer months as it is in cooler
months. But a WHO official said it remained unclear whether there were
truly distinctive seasonal patterns to outbreaks of the bird flu in
poultry. "We do know that the bird flu virus can survive for a time in
colder weather, but it's really not clear at this point whether the virus
is changing in such a way that it can survive in warm weather for a longer
period than it was previously able to," Roy Wadia, spokesman for the WHO
office in China, told Xinhua. "This is why it is so very, very important
that agricultural authorities anywhere share virus isolates bird flu from
animal outbreaks with the international scientific community," he said,
urging the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture to share isolates from 2005 and
2006 as soon as possible.

[Only China and Indonesia (and possibly Egypt) have reported onset of H5N1
influenza in humans during June 2006. The next most recent case was the
infant in Djibouti in April, proceeded by cases in Azerbaijan, Cambodia,
and Iraq in March, and in Turkey in January. Thailand and Viet Nam have
been free of cases of human infection throughout 2006. - Mod.CP]
