The United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed the presence of highly pathogenic H7N3 avian influenza (HPAI) in a commercial turkey flock in Chesterfield County, South Carolina. This is the 1st confirmed case of HPAI in commercial poultry in the United States since 2017. It appears this HPAI strain mutated from a low pathogenic strain that has been found in poultry in that area recently.

No human cases of this H7N3 avian influenza virus have been detected, and there is no immediate public health concern. As a reminder, the proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 deg F kills bacteria and viruses.

Samples from the affected flock, which experienced increased mortality, were tested at the Clemson Veterinary Diagnostic Center, part of the National Animal Laboratory Network, and confirmed at the APHIS National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa.  Virus isolation is ongoing.

APHIS is working closely with the South Carolina State Veterinarian's Office, part of Clemson University, on a joint incident response. State officials quarantined the affected premises, and birds on the property were depopulated to prevent the spread of the disease. Birds from the flock will not enter the food system.

As part of existing avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners are working jointly on additional surveillance and testing in the nearby area. The United States has the strongest AI surveillance program in the world, and USDA is working with its partners to actively look for the disease in commercial poultry operations, live bird markets, and migratory wild bird populations.

USDA will report this finding to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) as well as international trading partners. USDA also continues to communicate with trading partners to encourage adherence to OIE standards and minimize trade impacts. OIE trade guidelines call on countries to base trade restrictions on sound science and, whenever possible, limit restrictions to those animals and animal products within a defined region that pose a risk of spreading disease of concern.

All bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard enthusiasts, should continue to practice good biosecurity, prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through their state veterinarian or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593. Additional information on biosecurity can be found at <www.aphis.usda.gov/animalhealth/defendtheflock>.

Additional background:
Avian influenza (AI) is caused by an influenza type A virus that can infect poultry (such as chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, domestic ducks, geese, and guinea fowl) and is carried by free-flying waterfowl such as ducks, geese, and shorebirds. AI viruses are classified by a combination of 2 groups of proteins: hemagglutinin, or "H" proteins, of which there are 16 (H1-H16), and neuraminidase, or "N" proteins, of which there are 9 (N1-N9). Many different combinations of "H" and "N" proteins are possible. Each combination is considered a different subtype and can be further broken down into different strains. AI viruses are further classified by their pathogenicity (low or high), which is the ability of a particular virus strain to produce disease in domestic poultry.

[Avian Influenza (AI) is primarily an infection of birds. It is a highly infectious viral disease, classified according to its severity, with 2 recognized forms: HPAI, highly pathogenic avian influenza, also known as fowl plague, and low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI). AI viruses causing HPAI are highly virulent, and infected domestic flocks can experience high morbidity and mortality rates up to 100%. HPAI remains a high-priority concern for USDA APHIS as outbreaks have occurred in 2014-2015 (largest animal disease outbreak), 2016, and 2017. Most AI viruses are LPAI viruses and do not result in high mortality in wild birds or domestic poultry; however, strain mutation or reassortment to an HPAI virus can occur (through antigenic shift or antigenic drift). AI viruses are a significant concern to public health, such as H5N1, H5N6, and the Asian lineage H7N9. Human infection is generally uncommon, but fatalities have occurred after infection by certain strains.

Many avian species are susceptible to infection with HPAI viruses, including chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, guinea fowl, and a wide variety of other birds, such as migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Psittacine birds, such as parrots and cockatiels, are rarely affected. Mammalian hosts, including humans, may be vulnerable to infection by some AI strains, including HPAI H5 and HPAI H7subtypes.

AI viruses usually infect migratory waterfowl, particularly Anseriformes (ducks and geese) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds) that can carry LPAI viruses without showing illness. The wild bird reservoir of LPAI viruses is considered a major potential source of infection for domestic birds, particularly free- and open-range poultry. Following transmission from wild to commercial birds, the virus can mutate or reassort in gallinaceous poultry flocks, resulting in an HPAI virus.

The following are examples of how HPAI can be transmitted:
- Animal-to-animal contact: HPAI is usually transmitted via direct exposure to HPAI-infected birds, feces, or secretions from infected birds. When a hen is infected, the HPAI virus is also likely to be present on the eggshell and internal egg contents; however, to date there is no evidence demonstrating vertical transmission of the virus.
- Fomites: HPAI is easily transmitted by objects and may persist on an item for an extended period of time. For example, people, contaminated clothing, equipment, and vehicles can easily carry the virus.
- Wildlife: Contact with infected wild birds or their secretions, particularly wild waterfowl, is the most likely mode of introduction of AI into a poultry population.
- Airborne: Airborne transmission of HPAI is not likely a primary mode of transmission, although it may occur over short distances as an aerosol via contaminated dust. Incubation periods are variable; HPAI may be longer and differ per subtype. Typically, the incubation period in naturally infected chickens ranges from 3-14 days. The OIE recognizes the incubation period as 21 days.

Birds affected with HPAI show a variety of clinical signs involving the respiratory, digestive, reproductive, or nervous systems. Signs of LPAI are typically much milder. Appearance of clinical signs vary; domestic ducks and wild birds may not show clinical signs.

HPAI often causes morbidity and mortality rates in domestic poultry of between 90 and100%. Clinical signs in poultry commonly include marked depression with ruffled feathers, droopiness, soft-shelled eggs, sudden drop in egg production, loss of appetite, excessive thirst, swollen wattles and combs, diarrhea, incoordination, respiratory distress, and increased daily mortality.
