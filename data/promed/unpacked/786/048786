I'm an emergency physician in Northeastern Connecticut. While not battling
Lyme and Ehrlichiosis we have been hit a lot with the Raccoon rabies
strain. Mostly trying to keep people on the straight and narrow regarding
when prophylaxis is indicated and what is a significant exposure. The price
and availability of HDCV and RIG is obviously a big concern.
Yesterday we had a new variant of the rabies theme:
Five 10 and 11 year old kids walking home from school encountered a sick
raccoon in broad daylight at 3 PM twitching, frothing and having diarrhea.
The kids "rescued" the raccoon from some other more mean spirited
adolescents who were throwing rocks at the sick animal. They bundled it up
in their arms and were found by our paramedic petting the animal on the
sidewalk.
Animal control was called and (to the dismay of the kids) dispatched the
animal with a body shot and the head is being assessed for rabies (almost a
certainty to be positive).
So far 5 or 6 kids have been immunized.
Rabies is a new thing up this way as of late. We always had the bat (Silver
Haired) variant and in fact there was a death I believe in the other part
of Connecticut a while back traced to the bat strain. Another episode
involved a pony with rabies at a pony ride that exposed a bunch of kids.
The terrestrial [raccoon rabies has spread North as I understand it after
some rabid raccoons were released down South for hunting and the strain
spread North during the last decade or so. About 3 years ago it reached us
and every evening we would see staggering and dying raccoons in the roadway
(the initial die off followed by an equilibrium endemic infection).
Just thought this might be of interest to the group, a story for the
"trenches..."
