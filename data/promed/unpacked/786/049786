Hong Kong health officials reported Friday [30 Sep 2022] a case of human infection of rat hepatitis E virus (HEV). The case involves a 26-year-old man with underlying illnesses. He was found to have a deranged liver function during his treatment in Grantham Hospital. The patient is now in stable condition. His blood sample tested positive for rat HEV upon laboratory testing.

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP's) epidemiological investigations revealed that the patient resided in Tin Shui Wai. He did not have contact with rodents or rats, and had no travel history during the incubation period. "Based on the available epidemiological information, the source and the route of infection could not be determined. The CHP's investigation is ongoing," a spokesman for the CHP said.

The exact mode of transmission of rat HEV to humans is unknown at the moment. Possible routes of transmission include ingestion of food or water contaminated by rodents or their excreta, exposure to environments or objects contaminated by rodents or their excreta, and direct contact with rodents or their excreta. The usual HEV causing human infection is transmitted mainly through the fecal-oral route.

To prevent hepatitis E infection, members of the public should maintain good personal, food, and environmental hygiene. For example, they should wash hands thoroughly before eating, store food properly or in the refrigerator, not leave food at room temperature for a long time, and use 1:99 diluted household bleach for general household cleaning and disinfection as household detergent may not be able to kill HEV. High-risk individuals, such as elderly persons with a major underlying illness (especially those who have undergone organ transplantation), pregnant women, patients with chronic liver disease, and patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (also known as G6PD deficiency), who are infected with HEV may develop a serious illness, so they should exercise extra caution.

The five keys to food safety should be adopted when handling food:
- Choose (choose safe raw materials),
- Clean (keep hands and utensils clean),
- Separate (separate raw and cooked food),
- Cook (cook thoroughly), and
- Safe temperature (keep food at a safe temperature) to prevent food-borne diseases.

[Other means of prevention include the following:]
- Drink only boiled water from the mains or bottled drinks from reliable sources.
- Avoid drinks with ice of unknown origin.
- Purchase fresh food from hygienic and reliable sources. Do not patronize illegal hawkers.
- Clean and wash food thoroughly. Cook food, especially seafood (e.g., shellfish), pork, and pig offal thoroughly before consumption. Avoid raw food or undercooked food.
- Slice raw meat and offal into thin strips to allow thorough cooking, especially during hotpot or congee cooking.
- For sliced pig liver, depending on the thickness and quantity, boil at 100 deg C [212 deg F] or stir-fry in a hot skillet/wok for at least 3-5 minutes.
- Heating to an internal temperature of 90 deg C [194 deg F] for 90 seconds is required for cooking of molluscan shellfish. If possible, remove the shells before cooking as they impede heat penetration. Otherwise, boil at 100 deg C [212 deg F] until their shells open; boil for a further 3-5 minutes afterwards. Discard any shellfish that do not open during cooking.
- For meat and offal, make sure that juices are clear, not red, and blood is not visible when cutting the cooked meat and offal.
- When having hotpot, use separate chopsticks and utensils for handling raw and cooked foods to prevent cross-contamination.

In general, rodents (such as rats) can transmit multiple diseases to humans directly and indirectly. The public are advised to adopt the following measures:
- Eliminate sources of food and nesting places for rodents in the living environment.
- Store food in covered containers and handle pet food properly to prevent it from becoming food for rodents.
- Store all refuse and food remnants in dustbins with well-fitted covers.
- Empty dustbins at least once a day.
- Keep premises, especially refuse rooms and stairways, clean. Avoid accumulation of articles.
- Inspect all flower beds and pavements for rodent infestation regularly.
- Avoid the high-risk activities below to reduce rodent contact:
+ avoid rodent contact and places dirtied with rodent excreta;
+ avoid handling rodents with bare hands;
+ wash hands with liquid soap and water immediately after handling animals and disinfect contaminated areas; and
+ if a wound appears, clean the broken skin immediately and cover it properly with waterproof adhesive dressings.

Sridhar S, Chik-Yan Yip C, Hon-Yin Lo K, et al. Hepatitis E virus species C infection in humans, Hong Kong. Clin Infect Dis. 2021; ciab919; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab919.

Abstract
--------
"Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) variants belonging to _Orthohepevirus_ species A (HEV-A) are the primary cause of human hepatitis E. However, we previously reported that _Orthohepevirus_ species C genotype 1 (HEV-C1), a divergent HEV variant commonly found in rats, also causes hepatitis in humans. Here, we present a clinical-epidemiological investigation of human HEV-C1 infections detected in Hong Kong, with an emphasis on outcomes in immunocompromised individuals.

"Methods: A surveillance system for detecting human HEV-C1 infections was established in Hong Kong. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of HEV-C1 cases identified via this system between 1 Aug 2019 and 31 Dec 2020 were retrieved. Phylogenetic analysis of HEV-C1 strain sequences was performed. Infection outcomes of immunocompromised individuals with HEV-A and HEV-C1 infections were analyzed.

"Results: HEV-C1 accounted for 8 of 53 (15.1%) reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed HEV infections in Hong Kong during the study period, raising the total number of HEV-C1 infections detected in the city to 16. Two distinct HEV-C1 strain groups caused human infections. Patients were elderly and/or immunocompromised; half tested negative for HEV immunoglobulin M. Cumulatively, HEV-C1 accounted for 9 of 21 (42.9%) cases of hepatitis E recorded in immunocompromised patients in Hong Kong. Immunocompromised HEV-C1 patients progressed to persistent hepatitis at similar rates (7/9 [77.8%]) as HEV-A patients (10/12 [75%]). HEV-C1 patients responded to oral ribavirin, although the response to the 1st course was sometimes poor or delayed.

"Conclusions: Dedicated RT-PCR-based surveillance detected human HEV-C1 cases that evade conventional hepatitis E diagnostic testing. Immunosuppressed HEV-C1-infected patients frequently progress to persistent HEV-C1 infection, for which ribavirin is a suitable treatment option."

Additionally, a case was reported from Canada in 2019:

Andonov A, Robbins M, Borlang J, et al. Rat hepatitis E virus linked to severe acute hepatitis in an immunocompetent patient. J Infect Dis. 2019; 220(6): 951-955; https://academic.oup.com/jid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/infdis/jiz025/5288497.

A case was also reported in Spain:

Rivero-Juarez A, Frias M, Perez A B, et al. _Orthohepevirus_ C infection as an emerging cause of acute hepatitis in Spain: 1st report in Europe. J Hepatol. 2022; S0168-8278(22)00075-7; https://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278(22)00075-7/fulltext.

It is important to know that diagnostic testing for this virus, now reported in Europe and North America after 1st characterized in Hong Kong, can be problematic. - Mod.LL
