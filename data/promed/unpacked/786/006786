A Case of presumed PAME has occurred in Washtenaw County MI this summer.
The individual is a 41 year old man, otherwise healthy, who swam in a
warmed lake in late July at scout camp, getting much water in his nose. He
developed acute meningitis and confusion 6 days later, had CSF with 90%
PMN's and over 5,000 WBC, high protein, normal glucose, and MRI with
diffuse signal over the meninges. Cultures of blood and CSF were negative,
but direct microscopy of fresh CSF showed large ameboid cells engaging in
cytophagocytosis.
Treatment with IV and intraventricular amphotericin B, and oral rifampin
has resulted in survival with modest speech impairment. Notably, he
developed both a small temporal lobe abscess and a subdural collection
during the course of treatment (no middle ear or sinus disease present).
I have been unable to locate sequential radiologic studies of comparable
type in a survivor of PAME.
