Death toll of dengue fever rises to 427 in Indonesia
-------------------------------------------
The death toll of dengue fever across Indonesia since January 2004 has
increased to 427, while the number of sufferers has reached some 35 000, a
spokeswoman of the health ministry said on Friday. Jakarta is still the
mostly infected area, and 12 of the 30 infected provinces still have
extraordinary numbers of cases. The current attacks differ from the normal
5-year cycle mainly due to the change of rainy season from October,
November, and December to January and February. The disease has been
widespread in Indonesia since 17 Jan 2004.

[The case counts from Indonesia are obsolete as soon as posted, as the
epidemic spreads nationwide with daily more deaths recorded. ProMED would
be most interested to learn the age distribution of these deaths; previous
experience suggests they should be mostly children. - Mod.JW]

The State Health Secretary of Minas Gerais registered as of 2 Mar 2004,
1502 cases of dengue in 2004, including 6 cases of DHF. This compares with
646 cases of dengue in the first 2 months of 2003. The most affected
regions are Leste & Triangulo Mineiro.

Vietnam dengue cases double to 3300
------------------------------------------
Dengue fever has killed at least 5 people and infected 3300 others in
Vietnam so far this Year [2004], doubling the number of infections in the
same period last year [2003], a health official says.
The disease is found mostly in southern Vietnam, with 93 percent of the
patients from commercial hub Ho Chi Minh City and surrounding provinces in
the Mekong Delta.
Pham Ngoc Dinh, deputy director of the Institute of Hygiene and
Epidemiology in Hanoi, said so far Vietnam's northern region has not been
affected, but health officials have been warned about the possible
spreading of the virus. There is no vaccine for dengue fever.
Dengue fever, carried by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, normally strikes
Vietnam every year from April, the start of the rainy season.

According to these epidemiological bulletins, in the first week [of 2004]
there were 901 cases of dengue, including 82 (9.1 percent) cases of DHF.
Cases are increasing, and according to the national endemic service, the
situation is classified as an outbreak. The population under 15 years old
represents 50.2 percent of total cases.
Most cases are from the Capital District (144). The morbidity rate is 3.5 x
100.000 pop. Only 1 death is related to dengue. Circulating serotypes:
DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3 & DEN-4.
In 2003 there were a total of 26 996 cases of dengue (8.3 percent were DHF)
and the morbidity rate was 105.7 x 100.000 pop.

[ProMED welcomes Dr Rodriguez, who subscribed at the ProMED booth at the
ICID in Cancun, Mexico last week. We urge other ProMED readers to follow
his example in sending reports.
The source website has detailed maps, graphs, and tables showing the weekly
breakdown of cases by age group, sex, and administrative district for
malaria and dengue. It also has case reports for rabies, taeniasis,
cysticercosis, equine, and West Nile encephalitis, cholera, influenza, and
yellow fever. The report for epidemiological week no.1 (4-10 Jan 2004), is
the most recent to be posted. - Mod.JW]

Star looks to curb dengue at roadside bin sites
----------------------------------
Sanitation company Star Seychelles embarked on a campaign on Monday 8 Mar
2004, to clean waste bin sites across the country, partly in an effort to
quell the recent bout of dengue fever.
Star managing director Thomas Forgacs said that with a recently refurbished
bowser fitted with a high-pressure water cleaner, the project would entail
cleaning and disinfecting waste bin sites in Seychelles, which health
officials believe to be common breeding grounds for mosquitoes that could
be carriers of dengue fever.
Initial plans call for a routine cleaning of each site twice a year. Star
will begin in Victoria and work their way outwards from there.

Health authorities in New Caledonia have begun a new television advertising
campaign warning the population they need to take action to combat a fresh
upsurge in dengue fever.
Last year [2003] 17 people died from the dengue fever outbreak in New
Caledonia, which peaked in March and April.
An epidemiologist with the Pasteur Institute has told the Noumea daily
newspaper, Les Nouvelles, that he is alarmed at the latest statistics,
which show that the number of reported cases of dengue at the end of
February this year [2004] was the same as for February last year.
Our reporter, Sean Dorney, says a number of areas around Noumea have been
labelled high risk in terms of contamination potential. Health authorities
believe that the heavy rains that accompanied Cyclone Ivy and the current
hot weather have created ideal breeding conditions for the dengue-carrying
mosquito.

been reported to the Department of Health and Social Affairs (DASS) since
the beginning of that year, including 2317 confirmed by laboratory tests at
the New Caledonia Pasteur Institute. The serotype was dengue-1. - Mod.JW]
