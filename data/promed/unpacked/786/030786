A 2nd case of the virulent H5N1 strain of bird flu has been confirmed
at a farm by farming ministry Defra. The virus was 1st discovered on
11 Nov 2007 at Redgrave Park Farm near Diss on the Norfolk-Suffolk
border. Defra said the disease had now been confirmed at the nearby
Hill Meadow Farm, Knettishall.

The new infected premises is operated by the same company as the site
of the 1st outbreak, and all 9000 turkeys had already been culled.
Hill Meadow Farm [is situated] outside a 3 km (2 mi) protection zone,
which had originally been set up around Redgrave Park Farm, but
inside a wider restricted area covering Suffolk and parts of Norfolk.

A new 3 km (2 mi) protection zone around the fresh case has been
established, and a wider surveillance zone covering both sites has
also been imposed. [Hill Meadow Farm is just 8 miles (13 km) from the
1st outbreak at Redgrave Park Farm; a map is included in the URL above. Mod.AS]

In total, more than 28 000 birds were slaughtered following the
suspected outbreak of H5N1, a variant of the disease capable of being
transmitted to humans. The cull of poultry on 4 sites suspected of
being infected ended on 18 Nov 2007.

A 3 km (2 mi) protection zone and a 10 km (6 mi) surveillance zone
have been set up and the farm is co-operating with vets.

Defra are still waiting for the results of culls at 2 farms in
Norfolk -- Stone House, West Harling, and Bridge Farm, Pulham.

Fred Landeg, the acting chief veterinary officer, said the latest
results highlight the importance of vigilance from poultry farmers.
He added: "It is essential they practice the highest levels of
biosecurity and report any suspicions of disease to their local
Animal Health office."

A national and a local disease control centre have been established
in Bury St Edmunds, with text messages sent to all bird keepers
nationwide -- especially those in zones on the poultry register.

The cost of animal infections is thought to have cost the government
and taxpayers more than GBP 120m [USD 245.8m] this year [2007].

A 2nd case of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has been confirmed
on the Norfolk-Suffolk border, it was announced today [19 Nov 2007].
The news comes just days after confirmation of an outbreak at the
Redgrave Park farm, operated by Redgrave Poultry.

The declaration of a protection zone bans the movement of birds,
eggs, and carcasses into or out of the area and restricts other
movements within it.

However, the new farm is within a wider restricted zone that covers
Suffolk and much of Norfolk.

Hill Meadow Farm was identified as having "dangerous contact" with
the initial outbreak last week [11 Nov 2007] because workers for
Redgrave Poultry, which operates all 5 sites on which culls have
taken place, moved between the farms.

Defra said the birds appeared healthy when they were 1st inspected,
but a precautionary cull was completed on Saturday [17 Nov 2007].
Yesterday [18 Nov 2007] a Defra statement said 28 600 birds had been
culled at 4 premises.

"The laboratory test results today [19 Nov 2007] highlight the
importance of poultry keepers in the area being extremely vigilant,"
the acting chief veterinary officer, Fred Landeg, said. "It is
essential they practise the highest levels of biosecurity and report
any suspicions of disease to their local animal health office."

The operations director for Redgrave Poultry, Geoffrey Buchanan, said
Defra had told the company "a small number of turkeys" culled at Hill
Meadow Farm had tested positive for the H5N1 strain. "It stated that
on clinical inspection the flock appeared healthy, which indicates
the infection was in its early stages," he added.

According to the company, Hill Meadow is a seasonal farm that rears
turkeys for Christmas, and no birds have been slaughtered for food or
sent to customers. All staff at the farm have been offered
preventative medicines against avian flu.

A poultry market in the Aziziyah district of Riyadh was cordoned off
after inspectors identified 4 cases of bird flu there yesterday [19
Nov 2007] during a random inspection.

An emergency team, assigned by the Ministry of Agriculture to control
the deadly virus, cordoned the market off. The team comprises
officials from the police, the municipality, the ministries of health
and agriculture, and the National Commission for Wildlife
Conservation and Development (NCWD).

"There are 85 poultry shops in this market and each will have a
minimum of 1000 birds. The team plans to cull the birds and disinfect
the whole area to stop the virus from spreading," said Soliman
Al-Buthi, general manager of the Environmental Health Department at
the Riyadh Municipality. He added that the municipality is working
with the emergency team to tackle the problem. Al-Buthi stressed that
the situation is under control and called on members of the public to
help the authorities tackle the problem.

According to a statement issued yesterday [19 Nov 2007] by Muhammad
Al-Sheha, undersecretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, the
authorities have so far culled 222 000 birds in Al-Kharj, Durma,
Muzamiyah, and Al-Hayati.

Bird flu was discovered earlier this year [2007] in peacocks,
turkeys, and parrots at a house in the east of the Kingdom. This led
to a number of birds in the area being destroyed. The recent outbreak
of the disease has led to poultry farm workers being examined by
Ministry of Health doctors. All workers have so far tested negative.

"Farm workers were brought to hospitals in their respective regions
and were examined for bird flu. Clinical examinations revealed that
none of them had bird flu," Khaled Al-Mirghalani, Ministry of Health
spokesman, told Arab News yesterday [19 Nov 2007]. "We have given flu
vaccinations to all those who were tested," he added.

Al-Mirghalani said that the Kingdom has adequate stock of Tamiflu
tablets for use in case of emergencies. He added that there are no
vaccinations against bird flu and Tamiflu tablets are administered as
a treatment. "We're fully equipped with laboratories and drugs to
treat suspected patients, if any," said Mirghalani, adding that
citizens need to immediately report suspected cases. He also advised
people to keep away from birds, not to hunt them, not to touch dead
birds without gloves, and to only consume chicken and eggs that are
well cooked.

The Agriculture Ministry has called on poultry farmers to strictly
implement safety regulations. It also called on the public to inform
authorities about suspected bird flu cases by telephoning 01-403-0911.
