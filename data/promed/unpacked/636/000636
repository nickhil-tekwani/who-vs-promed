A flock of breeding turkeys on a farm in Maayan-Tzvi has been found infected by HPAI H5N1. The affected flock is composed of 35-week-old birds.

Preliminary clinical signs were observed on Friday (29 Oct 2021) in the males' coop only, numbering less than 400 birds.

The mortality increased, reaching a total of 9% during the same day [29 Oct 2021]. Individual animals presented neurological signs and stumbling. Necropsy revealed enteritis.

Samples were submitted to the Kimron Veterinary Institute, where HPAI H5N1 has been identified.

[A map presenting the location of Maayan Tzvi is presented at <tinyurl.com/3tehj92z>. As can be seen, this Kibbutz is located very close (about 1 km [0.6 mi]) from the large aquacultural farm (fishponds) of Maagan Michael, known to be densely visited by migrating birds during the migration season.

The above event is reported 5 days after Israel's official notification to the OIE of HPAI H5N1 affecting meat turkeys in Nahalal, located about 27 km [16.8 mi] to the northeast of Maayan Tzvi. This was the 1st H5N1 outbreak in Israel since 2015.

Subscribers are referred to the commentary of Mod.CRD in ProMED post no. 20211016.8699057.

Results of the epidemiological investigation of the event and information on the control measures applied are anticipated. - Mod.AS
