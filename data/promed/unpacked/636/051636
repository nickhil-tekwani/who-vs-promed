ANIMAL DISEASE ALERT

The Department of Natural Resources announced today that Chronic Wasting
Disease (CWD) has been detected in a sample from a wild deer near Roscoe in
Winnebago County. The young female deer was shot by a landowner in late
October 2002 because he believed it was ill. DNR Conservation Police
officers were contacted and collected the doe for testing at the Illinois
Department of Agriculture laboratory in Centralia. The animal was found to
be positive on the IHC test for CWD at this lab. A follow-up test conducted
today at the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa,
confirmed the diagnosis.
