[On 20 Jan 2020, a case of HPAI subtype H5N8 was detected in Brandenburg in a Greater White-fronted Goose, see ProMED-mail posting 20200123.6909182.

According to media reports, "Schleswig-Holstein's Agriculture Minister Jan Philipp Albrecht urged poultry farmers today to take extreme precautions and comply with biosecurity measures.

"Earlier, the Poultry Trade Association had already alerted the farms to increase safety measures, which include, for example, feeding animals in places that are inaccessible to wild birds.

"Moreover, surface water which can be accessed by wild birds must not be used as drinking water for the animals. And feed, litter and other objects with which poultry may come into contact must be kept out of reach of wild birds".
