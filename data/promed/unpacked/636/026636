In 2019, Washington had 2 outbreaks of measles, and one case of measles that was not part of an outbreak, totaling 87 cases. This is the most cases the state has seen since 1990. The 1st outbreak was January through May [2019] with 72 confirmed cases. The 2nd outbreak began 9 May 2019 and had 14 confirmed cases. It was declared over 28 Aug 2019.

The state is not currently in outbreak status, but measles is still circulating globally, and we could still see more cases in Washington.

City of Chicago health officials are investigating possible measles exposures linked to a recent measles case in the city. [See source URL for the dates, times, and locations of possible measles exposures that may have occurred on 12-17 Dec 2019.]

The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) says they have one of the highest measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination rates in the nation, meaning that most children and adults in Chicago are vaccinated and protected.

Between 2011 and 2019, there have been several confirmed cases of measles in Chicago, largely related to international travel. Most individuals in Chicago are protected from measles because they were vaccinated as children.

[4] Ukraine: IFRC final report
Date: Fri 20 Dec 2019
Source: ReliefWeb from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies [abridged, edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/ukraine/ukraine-measles-outbreak-dref-operation-n-mdrua009-final-report; original report: https://www.ifrc.org/en/appeals/


The measles outbreak in Ukraine has significantly worsened in 2018, as Ukraine reported more measles cases than all EU countries in the same year. Large-scale outbreak response measures have been undertaken since the start of the outbreak in 2017 to curb further spread of the disease and restore high routine immunization coverage; however, in 2018 the amount of the confirmed cases has increased 10-fold. In 2018, an average weekly increase of 11.2% brought the total number of measles cases to 54 481 (20 204 adults and 34 277 children), with 16 deaths. Since the beginning of 2019, prior to the DREF launch, more than 21 000 cases (7 deaths) have been registered, which is an absolute record for the country and [a] 300% increase from 2018's January and February months.

Despite the efforts of the national Measles Task Force [involving the Ministry of Health (MoH), key stakeholders and partners such as WHO, UNDP and the UNICEF] since 2017 to vaccinate every eligible child with the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) as they reach the appropriate vaccination age according to the national routine immunization schedule, the vaccination rate for 2018 decreased.

Multiple sources indicate a combination of possible reasons for low vaccination rates and the spread of the virus, such as low immunization rates in rural settlements due to high transportation costs, low vaccination awareness, and a high number of people in risk groups (e.g., HIV, TB, Chernobyl victims) with weakened immune system. Also identified as the main factor of the low immunization, vaccine refusal [has] become increasingly common in Ukraine, with parents correlating vaccination with potential health consequences for their children or [having] distrust in the quality of vaccines.

Throughout the DREF response that has lasted for 6 months (March-September 2019), measles outbreak statistics differed. The recorded numbers of measles cases of winter 2019 have decreased in spring and summer 2019; however, occasional monthly or weekly spikes of the caseload were recorded. Despite the mentioned, the overall trend showed gradual decrease of the cases.

There is a measles alert in Darwin. There has been confirmation of a further case of this highly contagious disease.

"This case is a returned traveller who acquired the disease while in Samoa during the severe outbreak there. The case was fully immunised but, unfortunately, as sometimes happens, still acquired a mild case of the illness," Dr. Peter Markey, acting director of the Public Health Unit at Top End Health Service said.

"People who are immunised and contract measles are not usually as infectious as others, but we still have to take the necessary precautions to prevent spread," Dr. Markey said.

The Centre for Disease Control is contacting people who may have had contact with this case to provide information and offer preventive treatment or booster immunisation as appropriate. [See source URL for locations and dates exposure may have occurred.]

"In addition, there have been measles cases reported in other Australian states and a big outbreak of over a thousand in New Zealand, so the public should ensure they are immune to measles and remain alert for symptoms," Dr. Markey said.

Up to one-third of people infected with measles will experience a complication. Complications are more common in young children and adults and include ear infections, diarrhoea, pneumonia and encephalitis (swelling of the brain) and may require hospitalisation.

A total of 7 new cases of measles have been confirmed in Hawke's Bay in the past 2 weeks, taking the total to 26 for the year [2019]. Hawke's Bay District Health Board Medical Officer of Health Dr. Rachel Eyre said the new cases were linked to an infant too young to be immunised, who had been hospitalised recently.

"Public health has worked hard over the Christmas break to identify other close contacts to identify those not immune (protected against measles) because of the high likelihood they could get it too," she said. Dr. Eyre said, as the cases were all closely linked, any risk to the wider general public was low.

[10] Papua New Guinea: 2 confirmed cases from Gulf and New Ireland provinces
Date: Wed 25 Dec 2019

https://news.pngfacts.com/2019/12/png-confirms-measles-cases-in-gulf-and.html


The Papua New Guinea (PNG) National Department of Health has confirmed 2 positive cases of measles on 22 Dec 2019 by laboratory test performed at our Central Public Health laboratory here in Port Moresby. Two of the positive cases are from the Gulf and New Ireland provinces, respectively. The suspected cases were detected through our heightened surveillance system due to the current measles outbreaks within our region.

In 2019, over a million children under 5 years were vaccinated; that is more than 95% of the national targeted population. However, because of the history of low immunization coverage in PNG, this could result in possible outbreaks of measles within PNG.

I urge the general public not to panic; we are working in close collaboration with the provinces. It is still uncertain if there are more measles cases in the communities, but we're taking all necessary measures to ensure the situation remains under control. New Ireland and Gulf provinces have already responded by sending out teams to investigate and carry out preventative measures including vaccination to targeted age-groups to control the situation.

The Department of Health acknowledges the support of the New Irelands Provincial Health Authority, Gulf Provincial Health Authority & Oil Search Foundation for assisting in the investigation of the suspected cases. The Oil Search Foundation assisted Gulf Provincial Health Authority with logistics, technical team support in terms of providing chopper, a medical team for the initial investigation, sample collection and shipment to the laboratory.

[11] Fiji: vaccination

https://fijisun.com.fj/2019/12/25/measles-outbreak-vaccination-for-39-years-and-over-possible/


People above the age of 39 can get vaccinated after Boxing Day [26 Dec 2019], Minister for Health and Medical Services Dr. Ifereimi Waqainabete said. Previously, target groups were from the ages of 19-39. Dr. Waqainabete said they had extra vaccines available, and this age-group could visit any health centre.

He had spent a day visiting health centres, villages and the Savusavu Sub-divisional Hospital in Vanua Levu, where the measles immunisation campaign was held on Monday [23 Dec 2019]. He complimented the efforts put in by doctors and nurses in making sure they reached out to the target groups since the outbreak was declared on 7 Nov 2019.

"I am confident that we will complete the vaccination of target groups by end of Christmas Eve [24 Dec 2019]," Dr. Waqainabete said. "Target groups are all children aged 6 months to 5 years, people born between 1980 and 2000, children who haven't received 2 doses of measles according to the national immunisation schedule, health workers, airport and port entry workers and hotel staff, and any person in Fiji traveling to overseas."

He said their advisory for measles against mass gather[ing]s continued. "Christmas and Boxing Day holidays are an opportune time for families to spend some quiet time together," he said. "I am confident that once we complete this immunisation campaign for the highest risk groups, we will be okay as a nation for the new year."

There are now 24 confirmed cases of measles in Fiji.

[12] Democratic Republic of Congo
Date: Fri 20 Dec 2019

https://www.msf.org/efforts-tackle-deadly-drc-measles-epidemic-remain-insufficient


Since January 2019, more than 288 000 people have contracted measles in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and more than 5700 have died from the disease. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), this is the largest measles epidemic in the world today and the largest recorded in DRC for decades. Efforts have been made at [the] national level, but more resources must be quickly committed and targeted to areas that are still suffering from this disease in order to stop this outbreak.

In areas with low immunisation coverage, vaccination can reduce infant mortality by 50%.

Several factors are contributing to the spread of the current epidemic in DRC. There is extremely low immunisation coverage in some regions of the country due to the lack of vaccines, vaccinators, or access to health structures.

On top of this, there are stockouts [shortages] of the measles vaccine in the country, difficulties in keeping the vaccine at the right temperature until injection (which reduces its effectiveness), and logistical difficulties in getting the vaccines to their final destinations. The needs are enormous, and the national vaccination programme cannot keep up. In 2019, measles spread to all 26 provinces of the country.

The epidemic is showing no signs of abating: 9605 new cases were reported in the last week of November [2019], the highest number since the start of the year. The fatality rate this year [2019], over 2%, is twice as high as in previous years. Nearly three-quarters (73%) of deaths are children under the age of 5.

In addition, measles cases remain underreported across the country. We have set up surveillance strategies to identify new areas affected by the epidemic in order to start interventions as soon as possible. For example, in Viadana, in the province of Bas-Uele, a small team went to assess the situation following a rapid increase in the number of cases notified in early December [2019].

What they found there far exceeded the data they had received. In a single school of about 300 children, more than 100 students were ill with measles. This assessment enabled us to immediately start medical activities for these children and organise a vaccination campaign.

A similar system has been set up in the 4 provinces of ex-Katanga, in the southeast of the country, where MSF has created "sentinel" sites. In October 2019, MSF put in place a decentralised laboratory in order to quickly analyse suspected cases of measles and rubella. Prior to that, the samples would have had to be sent all the way to Kinshasa for analysis, which took several months.

"When an epidemic is declared, medical care and vaccination must be combined to stop the spread of the disease," said Alex Wade, MSF head of mission in DRC. "Since mid-November [2019], the Congolese health authorities started measles supplementary immunization activities in the whole country.

"Meanwhile we continue to provide free quality medical care to patients," said Wade. "But for now, the epidemic is still several steps ahead of the medical-humanitarian response."

[MSF is] also active in the province of Kongo Central. To support the Congolese health authorities, on 13 Dec 2019 we opened a treatment centre for complicated measles cases in the general hospital in Matadi, capital of the province and the country's main port. A week earlier, another team had opened a similar facility a few hours' drive west, in the coastal town of Muanda. These treatment centres were overloaded within a few days after their opening, and teams had to relocate to larger structures.

In these treatment centres, MSF teams give specific attention to other illnesses associated with measles, such as malaria and malnutrition, which greatly increase the risk of death. But they also support the treatment of measles in the surroundings of these health zones by distributing treatment kits and strengthening surveillance and detection of new cases. They also provide free transport for patients who need to be transferred to clinics and hospitals.

Since 2018, MSF teams have been working to provide measles patients with appropriate care and undertake vaccination in various provinces of the country, including Ituri, Haut and Bas-Uele, Tshopo, Kasai, Mai-Ndombe, Kwilu, and Sud Ubangi. Between January 2018 and October 2019, a total of 46 870 patients were treated and 1 461 550 children were vaccinated by our teams in 54 health zones.

In collaboration with the Congolese Ministry of Health, [MSF] also helped to strengthen measles vaccination activities in areas where the Ebola outbreak continues to spread and, as a result, where vaccination coverage for other diseases has dropped dramatically. Unfortunately, many regions are still not vaccinated.

"Supplementary immunisation activities have been launched by the Congolese Ministry of Health, but there are still many health zones where the outbreak continues," says Wade. "We must wait until the end of these vaccinations to have a better understanding of the evolution of the epidemic.

"However, the current implementation of this campaign suggests that needs will persist, especially for children over the age of 5 who will not have been vaccinated during this period," Wade continues. "It will then be essential that humanitarian organisations and other responders pool all possible efforts to help the Congolese Ministry of Public Health to overcome this measles outbreak. Too many children have died from this easily preventable disease."
