In relation to the 'ticks and tapeworms statement' previously mentioned...
I think if you substitute 'vaccination' with the more accurate phrase
'treated' you will get a more accurate rendition of the quarantine changes.
Before pets are allowed to enter or reenter the UK they must be treated
against the fox tapeworm (_Echinococcus multilocularis_) using praziquantel
and ticks (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_) using an acaricide by a qualified
person in the county of origin. The document ..Memorandum on Rabies
Prevention and Control is available on the Department of Health Website at
<http://www.doh.gov.uk/memorandumonrabies/> and further information on the
Implementation of the Pet travel scheme, which will hopefully be applied to
other pets in 2001 is available on
<http://www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/quarantine/>

The reasoning behind the requirements for treatment of dogs for tapeworms
under the revised UK quarantine regulations is as follows:
_ Echinococcus multilocularis_, which is endemic in several continental
European countries including France, Switzerland, Austria and Germany, is
non endemic to the UK. This parasite which is extremely dangerous to humans
normally has a sylvatic life cycle (foxes harbor the adult, intestinal
stage and rodents harbor the larval stage) but both dogs and cats can
become infected with the intestinal tapeworm stage (by eating infected
rodents).
Humans can harbor the larval stage and become infected by ingestion of eggs
in the feces of the definitive host (foxes, dogs or cats). Humans develop
the larval stage of the parasite normally in the liver. The parasite in the
human is very difficult to treat (lobectomies and liver transplants are
used in several EU countries) and chemotherapy is difficult. It develops
relatively slowly in humans and it can take several years for symptoms to
show. There are several human cases of this disease every year in France,
Germany, Switzerland and Austria and, over the past 20 years or so, it has
in fact caused more fatalities than rabies in these countries. The tapeworm
treatment for pets (not vaccination) is designed to stop the parasite being
imported to the UK.
On a separate issue _E. granulosus_ is already endemic in the UK. There is,
for instance, a well documented focus in the Brecon area of Wales. The
treatment of pets is not therefore designed to keep this parasite out of
the UK as it is already there.

I believe the news report is a bit confused regarding vaccination against
tapeworm and ticks. The draft Pet Travel Scheme (Pilot Arrangements) Order,
Article 6 (4) states "animals will have to be treated for certain parasites
(the fox tapeworm, _Echinococcus multilocularis_, and ticks) to prevent a
risk of potentially serious zoonotic disease coming into the UK. This must
take place not less than 24 hours and not more than 48 hours before
embarkation for England."
