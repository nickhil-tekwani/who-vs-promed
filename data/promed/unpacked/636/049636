[Outbreaks reported here range from small flocks of several hundreds birds
to over 12 000 but do not appear to included highly concentrated, large
commercial operations. The numbers of poultry killed or destroyed are small
compared with the numbers seen in South East Asia. This outbreak may be
just be in its initial stages, however, as we have a wide geographic range
for the outbreak locations and not an overly large number of culled poultry
to date. We will keep you updated; latest information is available from the
OIE website at <http://www.oie.int/downld/AVIAN%20INFLUENZA/A_AI-Asia.htm>
