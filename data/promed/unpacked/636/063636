Lyme disease vaccine progress - USA (06) 981222232417

From: Patrick Goubau <goubau@mblg.ucl.ac.be>

The approval of a vaccine against Lyme disease by FDA is good news for the
US. From Lyme disease experts and vaccine manufacturers I hear that it is
active against _B. burgdorferi s.s._ but not against the different variants
present in Europe. For that reason it is at present not useable outside the
US. Even in the US it is far from perfect.
