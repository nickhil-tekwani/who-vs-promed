With 5 more horses testing positive this week [week of 8 Feb 2016] for the equine herpesvirus [EHV-1], the earliest Sunland Park can return to racing now is 23 Feb 2016.

That's left many trainers concerned, if the virus continues to spread; it could threaten next month's [March 2016] big stakes races at the track and possibly hurt their grading in the future.

"Right now it's holding us back on a lot of races, affecting us," said trainer Emilio Cadena of EC Racing Stables, who has 16 horses at Sunland Park. "owner-wise, they're asking a lot of questions."

As the EHV-1 virus continues to spread, concern among trainers and owners continues to rise. "Should you gallop? Should you not?" Cadena said. "Should you stay in?"

With graded stakes races like the Sunland Oaks and Sunland Derby on tap next month (20 Mar 2016), even if Sunland gets back to racing, one has to wonder whether the top horses will make the trip.

ABC-7 asked Cadena if he were training horses elsewhere whether he would bring his horses to Sunland Park for stakes races next month? "That's a no," Cadena replied. "I would not take the risk. I would stay where I was at."

The barns at Sunland Park remain under quarantine with 56 positives and 9 horses euthanized. Every single piece of clothing that comes in contact with the horses has to be completely cleaned.

"The quickest way to get back to racing is to get these animals back to good health, the entire community of horses there right now, all 1500 or 1600," said Katie Goetz, spokesperson for the New Mexico Livestock Board. "Their interest is the same as ours, which is to return these animals to good health."

Sunland Park spokesman Ethan Linder said he is confident the track is making progress against the virus. "I think we're making progress on a number of fronts," Linder said. "Getting horses back out of isolation and back to their home barns show that this is something horses can bounce back from. I think we just need to do our due diligence to monitor those still in isolation to get them back to their home barns as soon as we can."

Sunland Park officials admitted some trainers and owners could choose to skip Sunland's stakes races. Track officials also indicated they have reached out to Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, and to others in the industry, about whether the grading of its stakes races could suffer if top trainers don't bring their horses to the track this year.

The number of horses that have tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 now stands at 51 at Sunland Park racetrack, according to the New Mexico Livestock Board.

The last update, on 6 Feb 2016, said 3 horses have been released from isolation at the New Mexico track based on negative swabs and blood tests.

Based on no new cases in the past 14 days, 3 barns have been released from their individual exposure quarantines.

Since the outbreak was first confirmed by testing on 21 Jan 2016. 6 horses have been euthanized as a result of neurological problems arising from the infection.

Cases have been confirmed in 20 different barns within Sunland Park racetrack. 3 of the positive horses are from an adjacent training facility, Frontera, which is close to the Sunland Park track. Frontera has always been included in the original quarantine perimeter.

No movement of horses is being allowed in or out of the Sunland Park quarantine perimeter and biosecurity precautions have been introduced within the track environs to minimize the risk of spreading the virus.

Officials with the livestock board, state racing commission and Sunland Park are working together to control the outbreak.

EHV-1 is spread via a horse's nasal secretions -- either directly from horse to horse, or indirectly via human handlers, feed, and water buckets, grooming gear, riding tack, and trailers.

[This disease is easily spread and every barn should almost function as its own quarantine unit. Horses should have their temperatures taken twice each day, as sometimes the only detectable sign of illness is a slight rise in body temperature. Rest is essential for the horses.
