[Since these outbreaks are located close to the border with North Macedonia (where BTV-4 has been reported since July 2020-- see ProMED archive list below), it should not be unexpected that BTV-4 has now been reported in Greece.

According with the OIE WAHID database, since July 2020 North Macedonia has reported 56 outbreaks of BTV-4. For detailed information of these outbreaks, go to the following link https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/Immsummary, then select the disease and time period.
