The statement in the 3rd article that the "elephant herpes virus
occurs in the wild" is somewhat misleading, as research indicates
that the herpesvirus linked to this issue is a virus endemic to
African elephants, which has crossed into Asian elephants through
contact between these species in captive environments.

In African savanna elephants (_Loxodonta africana_) this virus is
typically associated with benign skin papillomas, but causes fatal
disease in Asian elephants (_Elephas maximus_). Similarly, some
studies cite evidence that benign Asian elephant herpesviruses can
also cause fatal disease in African elephants. An analogous situation
is seen in primates: cross-species infections with the human herpes
simplex virus may fatal disease in some non-human primate species (K

Is Toronto's big Rex to blame for demise of Hansa in Seattle?

A Canadian zoo is at the centre of a bizarre cross-border controversy
after animal-rights advocates in Washington state urged American
wildlife officials to halt a planned US-bound shipment of semen from
a Canadian elephant suspected of having bad seed. Biologists at
Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle are seeking sperm from 39-year-old Rex
-- an Asian elephant at the African Lion Safari west of Toronto -- to
impregnate 29-year-old Chai, who recently lost her 6-year-old
daughter Hansa to a newly discovered herpesvirus.

But critics, decrying the planned insemination as a "potentially
deadly game of Russian roulette" that could further spread the deadly
virus among North America's captive elephant population, are calling
on the US Fish and Wildlife Service to reject the Canadian
pachyderm's semen at the border. Unless and until the zoo can
definitively determine that the semen from this bull will not
transmit [the virus], the zoo should not proceed," argues a report
issued by the US-based group In Defense of Animals (IDA).

Bruce Upchurch, the elephant curator at the Seattle zoo, told CanWest
News Service yesterday [9 Dec 2007] there's "no scientific evidence"
to suggest Rex's semen poses a risk of transmitting the virus. "The
evidence and the experts are positive about continuing the breeding
program," he said.

Laura Richman, a research scientist at the US National Elephant
Herpesvirus Laboratory in Washington, DC, has endorsed the plan to
impregnate Chai with Rex's semen.

And Charlie Gray, superintendent of elephants at the African Lion
Safari, near Cambridge, Ontario, said Rex's semen is always tested
before any procedure and that it would never be used unless it was
shown to be disease-free. He argued in an interview yesterday [9 Dec
2007] that it's "absolutely not possible" for the herpes virus to be
transmitted via artificial insemination and that "there has never
been a correlation between an insemination and a herpes death." While
acknowledging that much is still unknown about the origins and
transmission of the virus, Gray said it "doesn't make sense" to halt
breeding programs that are crucial to the overall health of the
population. "We've had 11 Asian elephant births here since 1991," he
said, "and all 11 are still living." The IDA study -- which
recommends an immediate moratorium on all elephant breeding and
transfer programs in North America until more is known about the
virus -- notes that 2 elephants have died of herpes at what it calls
the "high risk" African Lion Safari, near Cambridge, Ontario.

The study also contends that artificial insemination, rather than
natural breeding, "would not reduce risk of transmission to females."
Hansa, one of the Seattle zoo's most popular attractions, died in
June [2007] after contracting a previously unknown strain of elephant
endotheliotropic herpesvirus, or EEHV.

The young female's death came 3 months after a previous attempt by
Woodland Park zookeepers to inseminate Chai with sperm samples from
Rex.

[It should be noted that not only has this semen been tested for the
presence of herpesvirus and found wanting, but that the risk is from
inter-species exposure. This semen is from an Asian bull elephant for
insemination into an Asian female elephant. - Mod MHJ]
