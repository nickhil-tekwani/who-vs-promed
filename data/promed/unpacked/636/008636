[1] Mauritius: plague concern

Plague is gaining ground in the Indian Ocean. While the last report shows 610 cases and 63 deaths in Madagascar [the latest numbers I have seen from Madagascar are 687 and 57 deaths. - Mod.LL], 2 cases including one death in the Seychelles, it is now the turn of Mauritius to record its 1st case of suspected plague. A man was placed in quarantine in Mauritius because of a suspicion of plague. The patient was admitted on [Mon 16 Oct 2017] at Souillac Hospital, a town located in the south of the island.

According to the protocol established in Mauritius, this hospital is empowered to take care of this type of patients. Analyzes have been carried out and the results are expected, says the newspaper L'Express de Maurice. Recall that the countries of the Indian Ocean zone are concerned of the spread of plague that is currently prevalent in Madagascar.

Unlike the Seychelles whose government has decided to suspend its air links with Madagascar, Mauritius or RÃ©union have decided to call for more vigilance of the 1st signs of plague in any person returning from this destination.

All passengers arriving from Madagascar are being followed up by Public Health department. This patient reported having fever, malaise, and sore throat after returning from Madagascar. After examination, he was thought to have an upper respiratory tract infection but was admitted to the isolation unit and started on doxycycline as precautionary measures, pending results of investigations. His throat swab culture on _Yersinia_ selective medium was negative. Since admission he has not had fever and has remained well. His blood culture has remained negative after 5 days incubation and he is expected to be discharged today, 17 Oct 2017. This was more a case under investigation than a suspect case, and it is considered that plague has now been excluded in this patient.

[ProMED thanks the EpiCore Global Surveillance Project member for this report. The case was imported from Madagascar and appears not to have been a _Y. pestis_ infection. If it had been the case, this would have been the 3rd country (the others being Seychelles, with any 2nd case not clearly documented, and South Africa) with imported cases. - Mod.LL
