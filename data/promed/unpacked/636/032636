I write in response to a previous posting [Lyme disease - USA (California)
20020518.4263], which said: "An active surveillance study done in 1988-1989
in my rural community of about 100 people showed that 24 per cent of the
study participants were seropositive (by IFA) for Lyme disease and 37 per
cent had definite or probable Lyme disease, 2 per cent also had babesiosis,
but we did not test for ehrlichiosis."
I wonder about the accuracy of serological tests for antibody to _Borrelia
burgdorferi_. If a healthy person with no history of a Lyme disease-like
illness has antibody to this etiologic agent, what does that mean? I am
certain that the above statement, that "24 per cent of the study
participants were seropositive (by IFA) for Lyme disease and 37 per cent
had definite or probable Lyme disease," is incorrect, given that a
serological test cannot determine whether a person is ill.
Tests for antibody to _Borrelia burgdorferi_ or other borreliae are
notoriously nonspecific and provide inflated estimates of the prevalence
and geographic distribution of this disease. While I have no doubt that
Lyme disease was underdiagnosed or even unrecognized until about 15 years
ago, I hope that nonspecific serological results are not being used to
change the perception of the importance of this disease so that it can be
added to the growing list of "emerging" diseases.
The meaning of "2 per cent also had babesiosis" also is unclear, and it
might have been a good thing that "we did not test for ehrlichiosis."

[Whether the screening test for Lyme borreliosis is the indirect
immunofluorescence assay (IFA) or the more commonly used enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA), there is a significant false positive rate in
patients who, based on clinical symptoms, are not likely to have active
disease. A western blot (WB) is particularly useful in increasing the
information gained from serology if the initial screening (ELISA or IFA)
test is inconclusive.
It is certainly the case that the relevance of a positive serology in a
totally asymptomatic person is unclear. Do such people, especially if with
a positive WB and in an area where the disease is endemic, need treatment?
Any comments on this cohort of patients would be appreciated.
The abstract below defines illness based on clinical findings, not
serological tests, which Dr Calisher so correctly points out, cannot be done.
The decision to begin treatment for Lyme borreliosis may be difficult, but
the use of clinical criteria and serologies as outlined in references 1 and
2 can put as much objective knowledge into the process as possible.

Here is the abstract of the paper cited by Phyllis Mervine (Am J Epidemiol
1992; 136: 1358-68) in the previous posting [Lyme disease - USA
(California) 20020518.4263]: "A 1 year prospective study of risk factors
for seropositivity to and contraction of Lyme disease among members of a
small rural community (population, approximately 150) was conducted in
northwestern California in 1988-1989. The initial rate of seropositivity
for _Borrelia burgdorferi_ for 119 current or former residents ranged from
15 to 20 per cent among 3 laboratories, with statistically significant
interlaboratory agreement. Questionnaires were completed by 93 current
residents at entry and 80 residents a year later to evaluate the
association of serologic status with 20 categorical and 47 continuous
variables. Seropositive subjects had resided in the study area about 2
years longer, were bitten by unspecified biting flies more often, and were
less likely to have engaged in hiking than seronegative subjects. One of 59
seronegative subjects seroconverted a year later (annual incidence 1.7 per
cent). The cumulative frequency of seropositivity for Lyme disease in the
study population was at least 24 per cent. Of 83 subjects examined
physically, 13 were diagnosed as having definite and 18 as having probable
Lyme disease. The seropositivity rate was significantly higher (38.7 per
cent) among individuals with definite/probable Lyme disease than in
asymptomatic subjects (13.5 per cent). Subjects who were seronegative or
free of Lyme disease reported nearly as many tick bites as subjects who
were seropositive or had a diagnosis of the disease. Age, time spent
outdoors in the fall multiplied by a clothing index, and woodcutting were
significantly associated with Lyme disease in logistic regression
analyses." - Mod.LL]
