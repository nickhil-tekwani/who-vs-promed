The carcases of 8 mute swans (_Cygnus olor_) from Caernarfon, North
Wales, were examined at post mortem by the Veterinary Laboratories
Agency Diseases of Wildlife Scheme (VLA DoWS).

The swan carcases had signs of severe trauma, with skin, soft tissue
and bony damage, and haemorrhage. Radiography failed to reveal any
evidence of bullet fragments and the trauma was suspected to be due
to predator attack.

The VLA provides surveillance for wildlife diseases in all
terrestrial vertebrate species in England and Wales under the VLA
Diseases of Wildlife Scheme (VLA DoWS) which is funded by DEFRA.

Quarterly and annual reports from the VLADoWS can be found on the VLA Website:
