'Sick' Raccoons Invading Area

Police said they've had at least 16 cases of "sick" raccoons staggering around the area in the past month.

The number of "sick" raccoons moving into Bridgeville and South Fayette has community leaders worried about the spread of disease by the wild animals. "Something is obviously wrong because I've never seen this many calls for sick raccoons," Bridgeville police Chief Chad King said.

King said he his police department has received 16 or 17 calls in the past two months for raccoons that appear to be disoriented or diseased. They don't necessarily have rabies, King said, but could have "a dozen other diseases." No one has been injured from any raccoons, although one apparently bit a Bridgeville resident's pet. The animal tested negative for rabies and is
doing fine.

He urged people to stay away from the animals and call 911 if they notice anything wrong.

"They look like a drunk raccoon," King said, alluding to them swaying and staggering while they walk.

Kings has contacted the Allegheny County Health Department and U.S. Department of Agriculture about the situation. The Department of Agriculture, which has offices in Coraopolis and South Park, is hoping to capture one of the animals so it can be tested for disease.

King said the cases have been reported "everywhere" in the borough, and cautioned people to not approach them. He added that there also are "quite a few" in South Fayette Township.

Last year, Allegheny County warned people walking on the Panhandle Trail in South Fayette to be on the lookout for rabid raccoons after a dog apparently fought with one last April. The county also worked in this area last summer trying to vaccinate the raccoon population.

[It is spring time, and our winters have been relatively speaking more mild than normal. Raccoons are likely on the move because of hunting and mating. As they socialize they may be exposed to distemper virus.

The clinical signs for rabies and distemper are extremely similar, but the ones so far have tested negative for rabies This suggests that it may be distemper virus.

Certainly there are other diseases that have to be ruled out first, but it should be considered in the differential. Rabies has been ruled out in the previous cases but caution should be foremost in the minds of observers and the next case could still be rabies.
