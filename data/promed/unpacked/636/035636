Local banana farmers are being urged to help the Ministry of
Agriculture in its quest to reduce the incidence of leaf spot disease
here, by cleaning up abandoned farms. The appeal came from acting
chief agricultural officer, Reuben Robinson, during a news conference
last week [4-10 Feb 2008] who said that the abandoned fields are
contributing to an upsurge in pests and diseases. He urged farmers
who have abandoned their fields to work along with the Ministry of
Agriculture and other relevant agencies, to clean up these fields.

Meanwhile, minister of agriculture, Montgomery Daniel, says areas
that are prone to be wet will have to be targeted in the drive to
reduce the incidence of leaf spot disease. Speaking at last week's
news conference, Minister Daniel noted that there is a higher
incidence of the disease in areas of high humidity, like the
Marriaqua Valley [Mesopotamia area].

He also explained that one of the reasons for the increased incidence
of leaf spot was a shortage of fertilizer, which resulted from
shipping problems.

[In banana crops, the term "leaf spot disease" is most often used to
refer to yellow sigatoka (YS) caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella
musicola_. However, it is sometimes also used for black sigatoka (BS,
black leaf streak) caused by _M. fijiensis_, septoria leaf spot
caused by _M. eumusae_, and a number of fungal pathogens in other
genera causing similar symptoms in different regions of the world. In
areas where more than one leaf spot pathogen is present, it is often
difficult to distinguish between them under field conditions and
laboratory analysis may be needed for a clear diagnosis.

Of the known leaf spot fungi, both yellow and black sigatoka have
been reported to cause serious problems in the Caribbean region. For
example, in 2004 a major campaign was conducted in the neighbouring
St. Lucia to combat YS (see link below). The report above may refer
to one or both of the sigatoka diseases. It is not clear why a lack
of fertiliser should increase disease incidence, but rather symptoms
may be more obvious on plants in bad condition.

BS affects only species of _Musa_ and is one of the most devastating
leaf diseases of bananas. It is present in the Americas, China, South
East Asia, and parts of Africa. The pathogen is spread through water,
wind, and on plant material, including suckers. Infection occurs on
the youngest leaves of the plant during and immediately after
unfurling. Older leaves are not readily infected. BS causes
destruction of leaf tissue, which affects the photosynthetic
capabilities of the plant and can reduce yields by more than 50
percent. Fruit produced on diseased plants can ripen prematurely
during commercial shipment and cause further losses. Disease
management includes frequent applications of fungicides,
phytosanitary measures, and cultural practices.

YS occurs in most banana growing areas and was first reported from
Java in 1902, long before BS appeared in Fiji in 1963. Symptoms and
epidemiology are similar to BS, but YS is considered less serious
because symptoms appear mainly on older leaves and therefore less
damage is caused to photosynthetic tissue. Also, there are more
cultivars of banana and plantain with degrees of resistance to YS
than to BS. YS has been replaced by BS in many areas, but YS is more
adapted to cooler temperatures and is often dominant at altitudes
over 1200-1400 m (3900-4600 ft) where BS is rarely seen.

The 3rd species in the genus, _M. eumusae_, has been identified only
recently and so far is only being reported from South East Asia and a
few locations in Africa.
