Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Russia
------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 27 Apr 2015 from Dr Evgeny Nepoklonov, Deputy Head, Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, Ministry of Agriculture, Moscow, Russia.

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (Final report)
Date of start of the event: 17 Apr 2015
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 21 Apr 2015
Date event resolved: 27 Apr 2015
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: Oct 2014
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N1
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic), laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Makarkin, Ikryaninsky, Astrakhanskaya Oblast [Astrakhan Oblast]
Date of start of the outbreak: 17 Apr 2015
Outbreak status: resolved 27 Apr 2015
Epidemiological unit: not applicable
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Dalmatian pelican: _Pelecanus crispus_(Pelecanidae) / - / 5 / 5 / 0 / 0
Affected population: The dead water birds were found in the Damchinsky area of the FGBI (Federal Centre for Animal Health) Astrakhan State Biosphere Reserve.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: The comparative analysis of the obtained nucleotide sequences of the H gene 258 bp fragment showed that the tested isolates belonged to an Asian lineage of highly pathogenic avian influenza (lineage A/Guandong/1/96 lineage, clade 2.3.2.1). Based on the H gene fragment nucleotide sequences, the given isolates were most similar to the type A H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus isolates recovered in Altay krai in 2014 (98.83 percent identity) and in Viet Nam and China over the period from 2012 to 2014 (98.44-98.04 percent identity). The hemagglutinin cleavage site of this virus includes several basic amino acids and has -RERRRKR- structure, which allows this virus to be characterized as potentially highly virulent.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs, screening, no vaccination, no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[During 2015, highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in Dalmatian pelicans has also been reported by Bulgaria and Romania.

The southern border of the Astrakhan Oblast is the Caspian Sea, eastern is Kazakhstan, northern is Volgograd Oblast, and western is the Republic of Kalmykia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrakhan_Oblast.

"Coastal areas of the Caspian Sea are a bird paradise, with many species of gulls, terns, and waterfowl. The northern (especially Volga delta), northeastern, and eastern coasts of the Caspian Sea lie on a major migration route between Europe and Asia. Tens of millions of migratory birds pass over the area twice a year, and hundreds of thousands nest there. Many birds stay for winter, and the wintering population of waterfowl in the Khazar Reserve is estimated to be over 600 000 birds" https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa1308.
