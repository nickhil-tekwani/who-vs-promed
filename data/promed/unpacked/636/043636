Disease attacks bora at Moblissa
--------------------------------
Farmers at Moblissa, Region 10 [Upper Demerara-Berbice] are concerned about a plant disease outbreak which has been killing their bora [snake bean] plants since February [2013].

"We noticed that at 3 weeks the plants dry from the bottom, then [the disease] kills the whole plant. We [thought] something [was] wrong with the seed, so we got 2 other sets [and] the same thing [happened] again," a farmer said.

It is from Moblissa that Linden [region capital] residents receive about a quarter of their fresh food.

[Snake bean (_Vigna unguiculata_ subsp. _sesquipedalis_) is an important tropical or subtropical legume vegetable crop. Other species in the genus include, for example, cowpea and mungbean. _Vigna_ is affected by a range of fungal, bacterial, viral, and nematode pathogens, several of which are shared with the genera _Phaseolus_ (common bean), _Glycine_ (soybean), and/or other legumes. Some of these legume pathogens may be seed transmitted, as seems to be implied in the report above, but it is not possible to conclude which disease may be causing the problems in Guyana.

For information on some _Vigna_ pathogens, see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives (listed below).
