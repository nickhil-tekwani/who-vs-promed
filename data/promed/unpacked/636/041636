Citrus trade resumes from "rest of Qld" zone
---------------------------------------------
From 13 Jan 2005, citrus from that part of Queensland outside the canker
quarantine area [RoQ] is permitted to be traded interstate without
certification that it has been treated for the disease.
Since the discovery of citrus canker in the Emerald district of central
Queensland, there have been tough restrictions on the movement of fruit
from other areas, such as Gayndah-Mundubbera. Strict surveillance has been
able to convince interstate authorities that the rest of the state is free
of citrus canker, says the DPI's Chris Adriaansen, and that will free
things up.
Approximately 20-25 percent of Queensland's citrus comes from that RoQ
zone, mainly limes and lemons. Traders can now operate freely with the
other states without any need for further certification other than the
treatment and certification that they were already applying for issues such
as fruit fly.

[This is good news for citrus growers and traders. This means that no
inspections, treatments or certification will be required to move fruit of
host plants from the RoQ to other States and Territories. The RoQ comprises
all of Queensland except the Pest Quarantine Area (PQA) around Emerald and
the Gayndah Mundubbera Management Zone (GMMZ). Movement of citrus plants
may still be prohibited for other reasons, such as citrus tristeza virus.
Fruit must still meet normal interstate entry requirements, such as fruit
fly treatment where applicable. The requirement for an Inspector's Approval
to allow for movement of host plants into the RoQ from interstate will be
lifted at the same time interstate movement restrictions are lifted.
Growers in the RoQ who are consigning fruit to Victoria, South Australia or
Western Australia will need to add a statement to their plant health
assurance certificates, which are already required for fruit fly and other
treatments. Growers should contact their DPI&F plant health inspector for
information. Movement restrictions for the GMMZ remain in force. Once
surveillance has been completed in the GMMZ, and provided no citrus canker
is found, DPI&F will apply to interstate authorities in February 2005 to
confirm pest-free area status for the GMMZ. This will mean that growers in
the GMMZ should have unrestricted interstate market access for citrus fruit
within the next few months.
