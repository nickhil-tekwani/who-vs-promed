[A ProMED-mail correspondent has drawn attention to 2 articles in the
current edition of The Lancet recalling the transmission of hepatitis
C virus associated with fibrinogen treatment. Although this practice
ceased around 1988 cirrhosis and other late-developing conditions
associated with hepatitis C virus infection may yet become apparent.

ProMED-mail is requesting information about the follow-up of
fibrinogen-treated patients in Japan and perhaps other countries
where fibrinogen treatment persisted for several more years. - Mod.CP]

A succinct account of the use of fibrinogen treatment, particularly
in obstetrics, is given in an article entitled, "Risk of
authoritarianism: fibrinogen-transmitted hepatitis C in Japan", by
Hideo Yasunaga, Department of Planning, Information, and Management,
University of Tokyo Hospital, Tokyo, Japan (The Lancet, 370, 2066-7,
2007). The abstract of the article reads as follows:

"In 1977, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) revoked all
licences for fibrinogen concentrate because of the risk for hepatitis
infection and suspected lack of effectiveness. However, in Japan,
fibrinogen concentrate was used routinely for treatment of obstetric
bleeding until 1988. Even in 1997, academic texts by Japanese
authorities in obstetrics still recommended that obstetricians use
the product. An estimated 10 000 cases of hepatitis C infection are
attributable to use of fibrinogen in Japan and are a result of
authoritarianism that hindered effective policy changes. Scientists
have a duty to refine repeatedly the quality of their evidence, and
policymakers need to adjust existing policies continually to accord
with the latest scientific evidence."

This article is complemented by an article by Carl Heneghan and
Rafael Perera, entitled, "Prevention of hepatitis C in Japan: a
lesson for us all", (The Lancet, 370, 1982-3, 2007).
