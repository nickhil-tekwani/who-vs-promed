Flin Flon has fared comparatively well during a mumps outbreak in northern Manitoba. A total of 98 cases of the highly contagious viral disease were reported across the Northern Health Region (NHR) in June 2017, with another 94 in July 2017.

"In a typical year, we'd see 0, maybe 3, 4, 5 cases. This is extremely high for us in the North," said NHR medical health officer Dr. Michael Isaac.

While numbers have yet to be finalized for August 2017, more than 60 cases had already been reported as of mid last week.

Additional cases were possible given the lag time between exposure to mumps and the presence of symptoms.

Isaac confirmed cases of mumps have been reported in Flin Flon in the past 3 months, but the number is lower than in other northern locations.

"In general, the number of cases that we've had in Flin Flon has been relatively lower than we've seen in some other parts in the region," he said. "That's not to say that the virus might not work its way into the community, given a bit more time.

"We've seen it in small communities, in First Nations communities, and in some of our larger communities as well. I would say for the most part, there hasn't been a community where we haven't seen at least a case or 2."

Mumps has been reported in all age groups.

The disease is characterized by fever, headaches, muscle pains and glandular swelling in the neck, chin and jaw. In serious cases, mumps can cause brain infections, meningitis, genital inflammation and swelling, and deafness.

Isaac confirmed none of the cases reported in the NHR have involved the more severe symptoms. "We're not seeing some of the significant and real consequences of the mumps," he said. "We just haven't seen much of that in Manitoba."

Mumps can lay dormant in a person for up to 3 weeks before symptoms present themselves. Most people receive a vaccination against the disease as children.

Isaac said a higher-than-average number of people in northern Manitoba are vaccinated, which reduces both the number of potential infections and the severity of symptoms.

"Our vaccination rates are actually a little bit higher than the rest of the province, which is contributing to the less severe cases we're seeing," he said.

Isaac said it's very difficult to say what is behind the northern outbreak. One possible reason is that mumps can spread more easily when people live in overcrowded housing and in smaller, tight-knit communities.

"It's just a lot easier for the virus to spread in those places," Isaac said. "People are out and about in the community, and your chances of being exposed to the virus on any given day may be higher than if you were living in Winnipeg."

Avoiding the mumps is as simple as receiving a vaccination. Isaac advises people to check their vaccination status and receive boosters if needed.

"If you haven't had a mumps vaccine in the past, we're encouraging people to go ahead and do that," he said. "That will offer some protection for sure."

People who suspect they have the mumps are advised to call ahead to a clinic or ER and book an appointment in advance.

"That helps from spreading the disease around unnecessarily when going through care," Isaac said.

For people who strongly suspect they have the mumps, Isaac says the best course of action is to self-isolate for 5 days.

"Once the 5 days is up, their chance of spreading the virus to anyone else is extremely low," he said.

Peterborough Public Health wants residents to check their vaccination records after 3 people were diagnosed with the mumps virus.

Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Rosana Salvaterra, said she wouldn't be surprised if more cases surfaced in the Peterborough area over the next few days.

"There have been more than 100 cases in Ontario alone, so it's definitely not surprising that we're seeing an outbreak here," she said.

Mumps causes fever, headaches and swollen salivary glands. The virus can put pregnant women at an increased risk for miscarriage, and some cases can lead to sterility in men.

"About 10 per cent of cases will go on to develop meningitis," Salvaterra said. "People can lose their hearing, and it can be permanent."

There is a vaccine for mumps, though Salvaterra said there are many people who may not have received a full dose of the vaccine.

Today, children get 2 rounds of vaccination before starting school.

But Salvaterra said there is a generation that only got one dose, which puts them at risk of contracting the virus.

"So check to make sure you've had 2 doses," Salvaterra said. "If you've had 2 doses, you've done the best possible thing to protect yourself, and about 88 per cent of those people will be protected."

Anyone who doesn't have the mumps vaccine is encouraged to call their health-care provider or visit the health unit.

The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services and the Municipality of Anchorage have warned Anchorage residents of a recent spread of mumps and are encouraging residents to update their vaccinations if necessary. Several new mumps cases have been diagnosed in the past few months, and there are now 13 confirmed cases of the disease in Anchorage. Most of these cases have occurred in young adults.

Mumps is a contagious viral disease with symptoms that include swollen and tender cheeks, fever, head and muscle aches, and fatigue that appear 2-3 weeks after infection. Males may also develop sore or swollen testicles. Some people do not have any symptoms, and, infrequently, persons with mumps may experience serious health effects.

Large outbreaks of mumps have occurred this year [2017] across the country. State health officials suspect a traveler from outside Alaska may have brought the virus to Anchorage.

Mumps is spread by coughing, sneezing, talking, and sharing cups or utensils. Infected people without symptoms may be able to spread the disease to others.

Alaskans can help protect themselves and their families from the spread of mumps by making sure their MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccinations are up to date. While some vaccinated individuals can still be infected, most people who have had 2 MMR vaccinations are immune to mumps. Young children and other people who have not been vaccinated are at a higher risk of contracting the disease.

Nearly all students in the Anchorage School District have had 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. Anyone unsure of their vaccination status should contact their health care provider.

A person with mumps symptoms should call their health care provider before going into a doctor's office to prevent spreading illness in the waiting room.

Orange County health officials have identified 3 confirmed cases of mumps over the last 2 months. The ages of those infected haven't been released or whether they're in a concentrated place. But, health officials say the risk of becoming infected is low, especially if you've been properly vaccinated against mumps.

If you're unsure, now's the time to check your records or ask your doctor. There's also a blood test that can show whether you're already immune. You also want to start monitoring for symptoms, which include fever, headaches, fatigue, loss of appetite, and the swelling of your face or jaw. These would show up around 16 days after infection.

Mumps is spread through direct contact with an infected person's saliva and droplets from coughing and sneezing. Local health departments offer vaccines to prevent mumps infection. If you're already showing symptoms, you should stay home and call your doctor.

[From 1 Jan-9 Sep 2017, 47 states and the District of Columbia in the U.S. reported mumps infections in 4439 people to CDC. In 2016, there were approximately 6366 cases reported to CDC; the number varies from year to year. See https://www.cdc.gov/mumps/outbreaks.html for a figure showing year to year reported case numbers.

Since the pre-vaccine era, there has been a more than 99% decrease in mumps cases in the United States. - Mod.LK

The state Department of Health's weekly mumps update Thu [28 Sep 2017] showed 24 Big Island mumps cases so far this year [2017].

The highly contagious virus has hit 419 people of various ages statewide this year [2017], the DOH reported. Hawaii County numbers continue to climb.

Those with confirmed or suspected mumps should "self-isolate" and avoid exposing others for 9 days after salivary glands swell.

Also, unvaccinated people exposed to mumps "should not attend school, work or travel from day 12 through day 25 after exposure."
