CHOLERA - COLOMBIA
==================
Colombia is experiencing its worst outbreak of cholera
since 1991, according to wire service reports. There are
over 800 reported cases since January 1; at least 10 have died.
The epidemic appears to have begun in the central province
of Tolima along the Magdalena River, spreading to at least 3
Atlantic coast provinces.
Health officials are on alert.
