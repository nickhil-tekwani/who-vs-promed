Rabies in Italy, October 2008
-----------------------------
On 21 Oct 2008, the national reference laboratory for rabies in Italy
confirmed a case of rabies in a fox in the Friuli-Venezia Giulia
Region of north-eastern Italy (marked in red on the map) [see the
above URL]. This fox was euthanized on 10 Oct 2008 after it attacked
a person who was out walking in a forest in Resia district, close to
the borders with Austria and Slovenia. The results were positive for
'classical' rabies virus by PCR testing [1].

Italy has been rabies free since 1995, although rabies has been found
in foxes in this area previously, most recently in 1992. In previous
cases foxes appear to have crossed the border from Slovenia and
Austria, although the risk of rabies in the northern and eastern
border regions of Italy has long been recognised. Local routine
preventive policies in Italy reflect the ongoing risk across the
borders, and include compulsory vaccination of domestic animals and
livestock which graze outside in those districts close to the border.

Local controls put in place in response to the present case include
vaccination and restriction of movement of dogs in the Chiusaforte,
Resiutta, Resia, and Venzone districts, enhanced surveillance of
wildlife, and oral vaccination of wild foxes.

This area is alpine and forested and not a major tourist destination.
However the following advice has been given for travellers from the UK:

Those who are travelling to the northern and eastern border regions
of Italy should avoid contact with wild and domestic animals.
However, if they are licked, scratched or bitten by a wild or
domestic animal they should wash the area thoroughly with soap and
water and seek urgent medical advice either in Italy, or on their
return from their GP [general practitioner physician] or NHS [National
Health Service] Direct.

Expert advice for health professionals is available from the HPA
Centre for Infections (CfI), Virus Reference Department (0208 200
4400) or the CfI duty doctor at (0208 200 6868).

[The Italian report to the OIE (ref.1 in the above article), includes
a map. Its Epidemiological comments say: "This is the 1st case of
sylvatic rabies in Italy after 13 years and the infection may have
been introduced in Italy from the East."

Located in northeastern Italy, Friuli-Venezia Giulia borders the
region of Veneto to the west, the republics of Austria and Slovenia
to the north and east, and the Adriatic Sea to the south. - Mod.AS]
