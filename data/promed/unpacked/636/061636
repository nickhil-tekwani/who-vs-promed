[In September 1996 there was a outbreak of _Legionella_ in the city of
Alcala de Henares, near Madrid, that seemed to spread via the water system.
The finding of _Legionella_ in water from showerheads in dwellings is
potentially pretty scary (might be nice to get some numbers--incidence, any
pattern vis a vis the city water delivery system. This might make some
interesting comparisons with the cholera epidemics in mid-19th Century
London that was traced to particular wells.) Some of the fault seems to lie
in an old water system -- dead ends that could harbor bacteria. Other
findings implicated cooling towers, but no evidence of _Legionella_ was
reported.
As a retrospective & history, this will have much more value with some real
numbers in it. Numbers infected, population composition, laboratory
confirmed, etc. (only 5 seropositive patients isn't quite up to the claims
of the report's title.) - Dave Coder (translator) <dcoder@u.washington.edu>

Excerpts:
Alcala de Henares, September 1996
The Most Extensive Legionella Epidemic in the World
---------------------------------------------------
Last September 11 [1996, Public Health Area 3 became aware that during the
previous two weeks Carmen Calzado Center and Principe de Asturias Hospital,
both in Alcala de Henares, were receiving an unusual number of patients
presenting with atypical pneumonia.
The Official College of Veterinarians of Madrid, conscious of the
responsibility assumed by the veterinary profession in the field of
environmental health prevention, exhaustively pursued events, which they
have summarized in this report.
Starting September 11 there began to appear in the press and the media in
general, news of the appearance of a growing epidemic of atypical pneumonia
in Alcala de Henares. As an immediate consequence, social unrest surged.
This news had an alarming impact, due in part to sensationalism in some of
the media, and also to memories of the not very distant cases of rapeseed
oil poisoning.
Alcala de Henares has approximately 160,000 inhabitants. This is a
traditionally working class area, with a complex and extensive social
structure, with all the complexity of a varied industrial area, city center,
services and bedroom community.
[Chronological summary
Sep.11: Detection of the outbreak, and beginning of sampling patients
Sep.20: Taking water samples
Sep.23: Confirmation of high titres of antibodies against _Legionella
pneumophila_ serotype 1 (Pontiac) in some patients
Sep.24: Start of application of preventive measures concerning water use
Sep.26: Increase in these measures, i.e., to abstain from using water
Oct.3: An outbreak of _Legionella_ is considered the most probable hypothesis
Oct.11: The outbreak of _Legionella_ is confirmed epidemiologically, and a
high risk zone is identified in the north part of Alcala de Henares; cooling
towers are implicated as a source of the infection.
Oct.18: The epidemic is considered controlled.
Chronology of events and actions:
--------------------------------
Sep.11-13: A growing number of cases of atypical pneumonia is confirmed in
Alcala de Henares. Start of the epidemiological investigation. Start of
collection of epidemiological data; opening of investigation of patients.
Clinical picture of atypical pneumonia. Median age of the cases: 68 years.
No response to amoxicillin or clavulanic acid; excellent response to
erythromycin. Grouping of cases in the north area of Alcala de Henares. No
detection of person to person transmission. Elimination of animals as the
source of infection. Discarded any implication of food in the outbreak.
Sep.14-18: A provisional hypothesis is pieced together that one can treat an
atypical pneumonia caused by _Legionella_ without considering infectious
causes, environmental effects, etc. There are no indications implicating
any toxin. The media are informed daily. There are requests for system
diagrams and technical information about the water distribution system in
Alcala de Henares.
Sep.20-22: Samples of running water are taken from the dwellings of those
affected and unaffected, water supply wells, water trucks and the fountain
in San Isidro Park.
Sep.23: The National Center of Microbiology reports the finding of high
titres against _Legionella pneumophila_ Serotype 1 in 5 patient samples.
Sep.24: They report that among the most probable hypotheses, the outbreak
could be caused by _Legionella_, and the Public Health office orders the
first preventive measures: Avoid aerosols of water in the home, prohibit
spray irrigation, stop cooling systems, and substitute baths for showers.
Sep.25: Technicians and specialists were assigned to the job of
investigating cooling towers in the areas at risk. Water samples were sent
to laboratories specializing in the detection of bacteria in environmental
water samples.
Sep.26: Hyperchlorination of the entire water distribution system in Alcala
de Henares. Cleaning of cooling towers to established standards in the high
risk zones and adjacent areas.
Sep.28: As a precaution even before taking water samples, closed automatic
car washes.
Sep.30: Correlation of bacteria in samples obtained from bathroom shower
heads and infection begin to appear in the dwellings of those affected by
_Legionella pneumophila_.
Oct.1: Perform the task of finding dead ends in the water distribution
system, verifying a lack of chlorination in some of them.
