A very intriguing report.
Is there a proposed pathogenesis or sets of microscopic lesions from
slaughter samples? Does it cause mild villous atrophy and less efficient
absorption in the small bowel? Does it induce some sort of change in
normal intestinal microbial flora and adversely affect
digestion/absorption? A mild, sub-clinical encephalitis (as in aborted
fetuses) causing a CNS (Central Nervous System) effect on the appetite? Or
do these animals simply have less "muscle mass" due to some affect on
skeletal muscle?
Those are a few of the possible pathogeneses I wonder about - as I am sure
the A&M group has questioned as well. Are these results (and possible
answers to these questions) published or pending publication?

Thanks for the interest in Neospora. I'll try to answer some of the questions.
1. Is the work published? Yes, an economic paper in May 1999 AABP, 2 papers
(1 regarding production losses, 1 regarding spatial association to wild
canids) in Nov 1, 2000 JAVMA, and one manuscript submitted to Preventive
Veterinary Medicine (ranch management risk factors).
2. Pathogenesis questions (listed in [1 above).
From a pathophysiologic standpoint there has not been, to my knowledge,
anything published to date to suggest mechanisms for the production losses.
Mark Thurmond had earlier published that positive serologic status for _N.
caninum_ in dairy cattle was associated with a 1 kg reduction in daily milk
production.
The studies performed by our group so far have been epidemiologic in
nature. Hopefully, these findings will interest researchers in the basic
sciences to formulate hypotheses like those you have suggested and then
test them.
