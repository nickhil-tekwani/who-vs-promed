[Castle wrote to USDA in early April 2002 asking for assistance in
clean-up so deadly disease would not be spread to Delaware Poultry
flocks
Sussex County, DE: Delaware Congressman Mike Castle today announced
the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has informed him
the Office of Management and Budget has approved $3.3 million to pay
for 186 technical staff to assist with the cleanup and disposal of
turkey carcasses and to oversee the ongoing Avian Influenza
situation. The funding comes from the Commodity Credit Corporation
Account at the USDA.
On 4 Apr 2002, Castle and Congressman Wayne Gilchrest and
Congresswoman Jo Ann Davis wrote to Secretary of Agriculture Ann M.
Veneman asking her to take the needed steps to address the deadly
disease which infected turkey flocks in their surrounding states.
"I am pleased the USDA has responded to our request to take control
and decontamination steps to prevent the spread of the Avian
Influenza virus on the Delmarva peninsula. We are very concerned
about the spread of the disease from the turkeys to the chickens
which could lead to extreme hardship for the poultry industry,"
Castle said. "Fortunately, Delmarva's chicken industry has escaped
this potentially devastating virus and I hope the workers on the
ground will continue to decrease the chances of the spread of this
disease."
Avian Influenza has been found in turkey flocks in North Carolina,
Virginia's Shenandoah Valley and West Virginia, and while the poultry
industry on Delmarva is not producing turkeys, many of these
companies have operations in these states. The Delmarva Delegation
is concerned about the spread of the disease from the turkeys to the
chickens, which could lead to extreme hardship. Japan has banned the
import of poultry products from Virginia and Pennsylvania and other
nations are considering a ban as well.

[It is time the USDA got involved to keep this disease from
spreading. The seriousness of this disease and the possibility of it
becoming highly pathogenic seems more likely. Let us hope that with
the USDA's help this disease will be brought under control rapidly. -
