The number of people who became sick with _E. coli_ O157 after eating
at a Harvey's restaurant in North Bay, ON, has jumped to 36, the
Ontario region's health authority reported Wednesday [22 Oct 2008].

The North Bay/Parry Sound District Health Unit said in a statement
that it was now investigating a total of 190 _E. coli_ cases, 36 of
which have been lab-confirmed to have originated from the fast-food
restaurant. These new cases show a dramatic increase from the number
of cases reported earlier this week.

"We believe the increase in the number of cases is largely due to
people who are still reporting symptoms and are within the expected
time frame of the outbreak," the statement released late Wednesday [22
Oct 2008] said.

The total number included 8 cases in other Ontario health unit
districts and one in Quebec. The majority were linked to the North
Bay Harvey's restaurant, which has been closed since last Sunday [19
Oct 2008]. The _E. coli_ patients range in age from 12 months to 90
years, the health unit said.

Food samples taken from the restaurant on the night it was closed
have tested negative for the bacteria.

[The vehicle for the spread of this potentially fatal pathogen
remains undetermined. The lack of positive ("smoking") cultures from
various foods in the restaurant makes elucidation somewhat more
difficult. An exact food diary of what each affected patient ate can
help to point to a vehicle when compared to a control group.
Cross-contamination in the restaurant is still a concern. If no other
restaurants in the Harvey's chain are linked, attention should be
paid specifically to a local ingredient or process. - Mod.LL]
