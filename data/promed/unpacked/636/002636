ANNOUNCEMENT (05): CALL FOR EPICORE VOLUNTEERS

EpiCore now has over 1500 members in 130 countries, but we still need more help!

EpiCore is an innovative surveillance program that draws on the knowledge of a global community of human, animal and environmental health professionals to verify information on disease outbreaks. When a ProMED moderator identifies an event for which additional information would be helpful, the moderator sends a request for information (RFI) to EpiCore members in the geographical region affected. EpiCore members may then respond to the RFI via a secure web platform, providing additional information as available. The ProMED moderator may then include useful information in subsequent ProMED posts (some examples below). The identity of EpiCore members is kept confidential, but members may choose to include their identity and affiliation in any ProMED posts or may choose to keep them confidential.

Are you interested in joining EpiCore? Members must have an advanced degree in the human or animal health fields (e.g., human or veterinary medicine, nursing, public health, microbiology) plus a knowledge of the basic principles of epidemiology, infectious disease, and/or related fields. All EpiCore members must have at least 2 of the following qualifications:

- An advanced degree in Public Health or a related field (e.g. MPH)
- Health professional certification or licensure (e.g. MD, DVM, RN)
- At least 3 years of experience in human or animal health
- Current affiliation with a medical center, university, Ministry of Health, Department of Health, or other health-related organization including NGOs & private sector organizations
- Successful completion of a Field Epidemiology Training Program

If you meet these requirements and want to be part of a cutting edge disease surveillance initiative, visit http://epicore.org, and apply today! A small commitment really can have a big impact on public health.
