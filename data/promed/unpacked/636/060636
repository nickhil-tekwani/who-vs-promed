Livingston ponds have West Nile virus
-------------------------------------
For the 1st time since 1997, a mosquito warning has been issued for the
Livingston area, after 3 mosquito pools tested positive for West Nile virus.

Allan Inman, manager for the Merced County Mosquito Abatement District,
said about 150 mosquitoes were collected on Foster Farms property on 10 Jun
2005, and the results were relayed to the district on Monday [20 Jun 2005].
Last week, a dead crow found on Foster Farms property also tested positive
for the virus.

The department looked at 27 pools of mosquitoes, with about 50 insects in
each, Inman said. The 1st 24 tested negative. A mosquito warning hasn't
been issued in the county since 1997, when Western Equine Encephalitis was
found among mosquitoes.

The Merced County Health Department had already sent a health advisory to
local health care providers last week [3rd week June 2005], after the
crow's tests proved positive for the virus.

Richard Rios, program manager of community health services for the health
department, said doctors and hospital staff need to be aware that West Nile
has been found in the county.

His agency is looking for specific help: "We want doctors to let us know
about cases of encephalitis or meningitis," Rios said, because those
diseases could be caused by the virus.

Rios said the county had given the abatement district maps of areas with a
high number of people over the age of 55. From those maps, Inman said, the
district can determine where to concentrate its spraying, because older
people are more vulnerable to West Nile.

On Monday [20 Jun 2005] morning, after the mosquitoes were found to harbor
the virus, Inman said his staff was in Livingston spraying around an
assisted-living facility.

Inman said his crews planned to spray the Livingston area Monday [20 Jun
2005] night, focusing on territories north of Walnut Avenue and south of
Highway 99. The spray the abatement district uses is not harmful to either
people or animals, Inman said.

Along with the spraying, Inman said there will be surveillance flights this
week [4th week June 2005] to look for back yards that have pools with
stagnant water in them, because they are perfect breeding grounds for
mosquitoes. Inman said his department has only about USD 400 000 left out
of a USD 1.9 million budget, and he's worried about running out of money
before mosquito season is over. "We're holding out hope that the state
passes the budget that has USD 12 million for abatement districts," Inman
said. "Otherwise, we may have to tap into our emergency line of credit, and
technically, we could get to a point where we couldn't treat areas for
mosquitoes."

[2] USA (Kansas): CDC reports 1st case of West Nile for 2005

1st US West Nile case of 2005 in Kansas
---------------------------------------
Kansas has reported this year's 1st human case of West Nile virus in the
United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.

The virus, 1st reported in the Western Hemisphere in 1999, has been found
in birds, mosquitoes or horses in 14 states, the CDC said. This means that
mosquitoes can easily transmit the virus to people, it said.

"This season's 1st human case of West Nile virus reminds us of the
importance of taking precautions to avoid becoming ill," said Dr Lyle
Petersen, director of CDC's Division of Vector-borne Infectious Diseases.

"It's impossible to predict what this year's [2005] season will hold. So
everyone who spends time outdoors should take steps to protect themselves
from mosquito bites and West Nile virus."

The CDC did not release details on the Kansas patient.

West Nile virus infection, common in north Africa, parts of Europe, Asia
and the Middle East, causes mild or no symptoms in most people it infects.
But it can cause a dangerous brain inflammation in some people, especially
the elderly.

Since it was 1st reported in New York in 1999, the virus has made nearly 17
000 Americans ill and killed more than 650. In 2004, 2535 human cases and
98 deaths were reported to the CDC, with most cases in Western states.

It has wiped out populations of crows, jays, and similar birds who are
susceptible and spread to every U.S. state except Alaska and Hawaii, as
well as parts of Canada and Mexico.

CDC recommends wearing long sleeves and trousers to protect against
mosquito bite and using insect repellent. "In addition to DEET and
permethrin, repellents containing picaridin and oil of lemon eucalyptus
have recently been found to provide reliable and long-lasting protection
from mosquito bites," the CDC said in a statement.
