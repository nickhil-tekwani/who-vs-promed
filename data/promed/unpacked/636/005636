A Rift Valley fever (RVF) outbreak has been reported in Kamonyi District, weeks after RVF wreaked havoc in livestock in Eastern Province. The disease has been detected in cows that died in the district's 4 sectors of Rukoma, Kayenzi, Ngamba and Nyarubaka.

Rwanda Agricultural Board reports, as of [30 Jun 2018], at least 11 cows died from RVF, one cow is showing signs of RVF disease, and 24 have aborted in the process. Rukoma sector has so far been hit hardest by the outbreak, with 8 cows killed, one showing signs of RVF, and 5 have aborted. Also, 2 more cows died of RVF in Ngamba and one in Kayenzi, and the most abortion cases (19) were identified in Nyarubaka sector, where one cow also died.

Dr. Solange Uwituze, the RAB Deputy Director General in charge of Animal Resources Research and Technology Transfer, said they are currently treating infected cows while vaccination continues in the affected areas. "Actually, the district had previously had animals vaccinated against RVF disease for farmers raising cows near River Nyabarongo. Unfortunately, the disease spread to areas due to stagnated water brought about by recent heavy rains," she told The New Times.

She added: "We are now vaccinating non-RVF-infected cows and calves under 3 months of age, especially in susceptible areas, while those which were infected are being treated." Dr. Uwituze also cautioned livestock farmers and the public to wear protective gear while treating or touching infected or dead cows to ensure self-protection against further spread. But she advised that the most important thing is that farmers should raise their cows in cowsheds, saying they are safer places to protect against diseases like the deadly fever.

Before striking Kamonyi, more than 100 cows were killed by RVF disease in the Eastern Province's Ngoma, Kirehe and Kayonza districts since April, pushing the Ministry of Agriculture to impose restriction on cattle movement in the province to avoid further spreading to other parts of the country. However, Dr. Uwituze said that despite the restricted movement, cattle business will continue to operate, but warned farmers to keep the animals away from wetlands.

Last year, the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources introduced a new livestock insurance scheme that will provide financial support to farmers in the event of death of their cattle as a mechanism to minimize risks and losses that farmers encounter. However, the scheme remains a work in progress.

[According to the above report, RVF, expressed mainly by cattle death and abortions, became active in Rwanda in April 2018, in the districts of Ngoma, Kirehe and Kayonza, in the southwest of the Eastern Province. Kamonyi, addressed in the report here, is a district in Rwanda's Southern Province.

An administrative map of Rwanda and detailed districts maps are available at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Districts_of_Rwanda#Eastern_Province.

In the absence of data on the number of susceptible animals on the affected holdings, the mortality rate in cattle is not known. Based on accumulated field observations and experimental RVF infection trials, the mortality in adult cattle is not expected to exceed 10 percent. So far, no human cases have been reported in Rwanda. 

The tests upon which RVF has been confirmed and statistics pertaining to the number, locations, morbidity and mortality rates in Rwanda's animal population, are expected to be included in the due official immediate notification to the OIE. 

Kenya submitted its immediate notification on 8 Jun 2018; follow-up reports have been submitted on 15 Jun, 22 Jun and 2 Jul [all 2018]. A summary of the Kenyan event (in animals) and a map are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000027108_20180702_182326.pdf.

On 29 Jun 2018, FAO issued an official RVF Alert for Eastern African countries. The veterinary services and livestock farmers' communities in the region were advised to remain vigilant to the potential occurrence and spread of RVF in humans and/or animals. - Mod.AS
