Cases of flesh-eating bacteria may be on the rise in Hawaii. Necrotizing fasciitis is a disease that quickly eats away at the layer between a person's skin and muscles, and in some cases it can lead to death. Doctors on the Big Island say they've come across about 6 to 7 patients with the flesh-eating bacterial [infection] in the past month [August-September 2013].

One of those patients recalled what led to him losing flesh from his leg. He says he was surprised and shocked at how quickly the bacteria spread. The 71-year-old from Kihei, Maui, described it as a "very scary and emotional event." His doctor said if [the patient had] waited any longer to go to the hospital, his condition could have been a lot worse. "He was actually touch and go for the 1st few days; we had him in the intensive care unit, and these types of infections can just overwhelm the body," said Dr. Dan Hudak, who works at the Hilo Medical Center.

The patient traveled to the Big Island to visit family and house sit for a friend. While there he decided to take a long bike ride. He came across a large lilikoi [yellow passion fruit] on the path and when he stopped to pick it up, he scraped his leg. "It was bleeding a little bit so I had to clean that off," he said. But bacteria found its way into his body. It possibly happened when he went swimming with his open wound in the pond. Then, 24 hours later, he came down with a 104-degree fever and noticed a change of color throughout his leg. "It was red and hot and what they call cellulitis," he said.

The condition of his leg had worsened 2 days later, and his friends took him to the hospital. Doctors removed the dead skin and tissue before it was too late. The patient will spend another week in the hospital before being let out. He's scheduled to have a skin graft.

Meanwhile, health officials warn that these cases happen, and it's not just in the water. If you have a break in your skin, it can happen to you anywhere certain bacteria live. If your tissue gets infected, you should notice the pain and the affected area should feel soft. "On the surface you don't see a lot, but when you touch the wound or touch the area, it's so painful," said Dr. Sarah Park, Hawaii State Department of Health.

Cases of this flesh-eating bacterial [infection] might not be as rare as we thought in the past. "The prevalence of this necrotizing fasciitis seems to be significantly increasing over the past few years," said Dr. Hudak. A spokesperson for Hawaii County told KITV4 that it closed Ahalanui Park Thursday [26 Sep 2013] after hearing about this incident, and it will work with the state to have water tests done.

[Necrotizing fasciitis, also called "flesh-eating disease," is a rapidly progressive infection that destroys the soft tissues covering muscle (fascia). Most commonly the pathogen enters the body through a break in the skin, like a cut, scrape, burn, insect bite, or puncture wound. Most people who get necrotizing fasciitis have other health problems that include diabetes, kidney disease, cancer, or other chronic health conditions that weaken the body's immune system.

Patients usually complain of intense pain in the involved region that initially may seem out of proportion to the external appearance of the overlying skin. Aggressive surgical debridement of all necrotic tissue and administration of antibiotics are necessary. However, surgical intervention is often delayed after hospital admission, because these infections can be difficult to recognize in their early stages, and deep muscle necrosis may not be appreciated early on. The commonest type of bacteria causing necrotizing fasciitis is _Streptococcus pyogenes_ (group A streptococcus or GAS), but fungi (such as mucor) and other bacteria, such as _Aeromonas hydrophila_ (http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/562854), _Vibrio vulnificus_, _Staphylococcus aureus_, and mixtures of multiple aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species, can cause necrotizing fasciitis.

The specific microbial etiologies in the Hawaii outbreak are not specified in the news release above. GAS are the most common causes of necrotizing fasciitis. Mucormycotic necrotizing fasciitis has been described following traumatic injuries sustained, for example, in tornados. _V. vulnificus_ infections are acquired following wound contamination with salt water. _A. hydrophila_ infections can follow wound contamination with freshwater, as well as brackish water.

In the case mentioned in the news report above, the fact that the patient went swimming with his open wound in the pond suggests possible _A. hydrophila_ infection.

Each year in the US, GAS cause about 650-800 cases of necrotizing fasciitis (an incidence rate of about 0.2 per 100 000), and the CDC says that the incidence is not rising (http://www.cdc.gov/features/necrotizingfasciitis/).

Most cases of necrotizing fasciitis likely occur randomly and are not linked to similar infections in others. However, GAS infections can be highly contagious: skin lesions, poor personal hygiene, and crowded conditions, e.g., in shelters for the homeless, would be expected to facilitate GAS spread from person to person.

A description of the microbial etiology of the cases involved, patient characteristics, and any epidemiologic linkages among the patients would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
