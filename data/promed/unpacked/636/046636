The Norwegian Institute of Public Health (Folkehelseinstituttet; FHI) has been notified of an ongoing outbreak with the bacterium _Serratia marcescens_, which has been detected in several of the country's hospitals. A total of 33 cases have now been reported from 3 of the country's 4 health regions. FHI is now contributing to the outbreak work by coordinating a group with representatives from all health regions, says senior physician Arne Taxt at the Institute of Public Health.

In addition, the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Norwegian Medicines Agency are involved in the investigative work. The purpose is to get a broad overview of the situation and stop the outbreak. It is currently unclear what the source of infection is, and where the infection may have spread. The working group works systematically to map the extent of the outbreak, find routes of infection, and to investigate whether there may be a common source of infection, says Taxt.

The outbreak was discovered in October 2022 when hospitals in Helse Midt-Norge reacted to an increase in the number of patients in the region who were diagnosed with _Serratia marcescens_. Seven of these turned out to be identical bacterial strains with the same genetic profile. Helse Midt-Norge then also examined earlier patient samples, and has identified a total of 9 cases with the same bacterial strain from 2022 and one from 2021. Last week, 3 health organizations in Helse Sør-East also announced the discovery of this bacterial strain in a total of 7 patient samples from 2022. Three deaths have been reported where the infection may have been a contributing factor.

As of 22 Nov 2022, FHI has identified 33 cases in the 3 health regions Health Central Norway, Health West and Health South-East. So far, no common cause of infection has been identified in the patients, and further investigations are ongoing, he concludes.

_Serratia marcescens_ is a commonly occurring bacterium that, among other things, thrives in water and moist environments, as well as in hospital environments. It rarely causes disease in healthy people, but can cause serious disease in patients with weakened immune systems. Infections with _Serratia marcescens_ can be treated with antibiotics.

[Norway is divided into 5 geographical regions: Northern Norway, Trøndelag (Central Norway or Midt-Norge), Western, Southern, and Eastern Norway (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Norway). A map of Norway showing its 5 regions can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regions_of_Norway#/media/File:Norske_landsdeler_H.png.

Norway is further divided into 4 health regions: Northern, Central, Western and Southeastern (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_health_authority_(Norway)).

A total of 33 cases of _Serratia marcescens_ have been reported in 3 of the country's 4 health regions, Central Norway, Health West and Health South-East. Of these patients, 17 were infected by _S. marcescens_ that have the same genotype in 2 of the regions, Health West and Health South-East. No common source for these infections has been identified as yet.

_Serratia marcescens__ is a Gram negative bacillus and a member of the Enterobacterales family. Although not normally part of the human flora, it is an important pathogen, especially in healthcare settings in adult and pediatric patients. Colonized or infected patients and contaminated environmental surfaces represent important reservoirs for _Serratia_ in a healthcare setting. Transmission through carriage on the hands of healthcare personnel and on sinks and other hospital equipment are important routes in many nosocomial outbreaks.

_S. marcescens_ has caused NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) outbreaks due to contamination of intravenous (IV) fluids (see ProMED-mail post Serratia marcescens - Venezuela (02): (CA) NICU, fatal 20120417.1103584). Contaminated liquid soap used for handwashing has also been found to be a source in another NICU outbreak (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18782359). A multistate outbreak of _S. marcescens_ bloodstream infection was reported in 2009 to be associated with contamination of unopened prefilled heparin and saline syringes manufactured by single company, which grew _S. marcescens_ that genetically matched clinical isolates (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19822828).

We await the results as the investigation of this outbreak continues. - Mod.ML
