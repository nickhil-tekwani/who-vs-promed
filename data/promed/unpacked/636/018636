During epidemiological week [EW] 17 2008 [20-26 Apr 2008], 2 probable
cases of sylvan [jungle] yellow fever [YF] were reported in Peru. The
1st case was a 23-year-old unvaccinated man from the Loreto
department [equivalent of state or province. - Mod.TY]; the probable
location of infection is under investigation. The 2nd case is a
21-year-old man of unknown vaccination status from Tocache Nuevo (
Tocache district and province), San Martin department. He became ill
during EW 15 [6-12 Apr 2008].

During EW 1-17 of 2008, there were 13 reported [YF] cases in Peru,
including 3 confirmed cases, 6 probable cases, and 4 discarded cases.
All of the confirmed cases died.

In March 2008, the Ecuador Ministry of Health recommended yellow
fever [YF] vaccination for all travelers to the following provinces
in the Amazon Basin: Morona-Santiago, Napo, Orellana, Pastaza,
Sucumbios, and Zamora-Chinchipe. Based on this information, CDC has
expanded its current yellow fever vaccine recommendations for Ecuador
to include all areas of the provinces listed above, which extends the
defined yellow fever risk area to these provincial borders. This is
in addition to the current recommendation for yellow fever
vaccination for travelers going to areas along the eastern slopes and
to the east of the Andes Mountains. At present, yellow fever
vaccination is only required for travelers entering Ecuador if they
are greater than one year of age and if they are coming from a
country in the yellow fever endemic zone
(<http://wwwn.cdc.gov/travel/yellowBookCh4-YellowFever.aspx#667>.)

[Although the sporadic cases of sylvan YF reported are indeed
unfortunate, considering that they were preventable by vaccination,
from a public health standpoint it is fortunate that spread did not
occur to populated areas where there is risk of an urban cycle of YF
virus transmission. Recent dengue outbreaks in these countries
indicate that there are _Aedes aegypti_ vectors present and the risk
of urban YF is real.
