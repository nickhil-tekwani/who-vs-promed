Foot-and-mouth disease, Bulgaria
--------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 25 Feb 2011 from Mr Nikola T
Belev, [president of the OIE Regional Commission for Europe, delegate
to the OIE, OIE regional representation for Europe], Sofia, Bulgaria

Summary
Report type: follow-up report no 5
Start date: 4 Jan 2011
Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 4 Jan 2011
Report date: 25 Feb 2011
Date submitted to OIE: 25 Feb 2011
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: October 1996
Manifestation of disease: sub-clinical infection
Causal agent: Foot and mouth disease virus
Serotype: O
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (basic)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country
Outbreaks: there are no new outbreaks in this report

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or
inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: no changes in the epizootic situation have
been observed since the last outbreak (31 Jan 2011). The daily
clinical examinations of the susceptible animals are continuing in the
villages of the municipalities at risk (Tsarevo, Malko Tarnovo,
Sredets Primorsko, and Sozopol).

Furthermore, the 2nd round of blood sampling has been conducted
during the last 2 weeks and will be finalized at the end of this
week.

In 10 villages nearby the Turkish border and the villages within the
10-km [6 mi] zones around the outbreaks, 100 percent of the
susceptible animals are sampled, while in all other villages samples
were taken according to an estimated 5 percent prevalence and 95
percent confidence; large herds of susceptible animals (larger than 50
animals) are sampled every 7 days.

All tested animals were negative for FMD.

Control measures
Measures applied: control of wildlife reservoirs [as previously
published, this includes hunting restrictions. - Mod.AS]; movement
control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of
infected premises/establishment(s); no vaccination; no treatment of
affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: FMD National Reference Laboratory (national
laboratory)
Tests and results
Species / Test / Test date / Result
Cattle / Non-structural protein ELISA / 25 Feb 2011 / Negative
Sheep & goats / Non-structural protein ELISA / 25 Feb 2011 /

FMD in Bulgaria: EC partly lifts protection measures after successful
implementation of EU rules
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Using the new Comitology procedure for the 1st time, the European
Commission decided yesterday [1 Mar 2011] to reduce the areas under
restriction in Bulgaria due to foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The new
'Comitology Regulation', which entered into force on 1 Mar 2011, lays
down the rules on how Member States can exercise control of the
Commission's implementing powers, press office of the European
Commission Representation in Sofia announced.

Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) was first diagnosed in a wild boar shot
by hunters at the end of 2010 in the region of Burgas in southeast
Bulgaria, close to the border with Turkey, and later testing of
samples from farmed animals rendered positive FMD results.
Consequently, the Commission defined high- and low-risk areas in
Commission Decision 2011/44/EC prohibiting the dispatch of susceptible
animals from both these areas and the dispatch of products derived
from susceptible animals from the high-risk area. This decision also
provides for the rules applicable to the dispatch from those areas of
safe products. As safe are considered those products that either had
been produced before the restrictions and are originating from outside
the restricted areas or that had undergone an effective anti-virus
treatment.

No new outbreaks have been reported since 31 Jan 2011 and
surveillance has been implemented with satisfactory results in
Bulgaria. It is therefore possible to reduce the size of the high-risk
area to the 2 municipalities only (Malko Tarnovo and Tsarevo) and to
include in the low-risk area only the 3 surrounding municipalities of
the Burgas region.

[During the event, FMD lesions have been observed in a wild boar and
in local Bulgarian cattle (in which, 2- to 10-day-old mouth lesions
were recorded; see item 2 in ProMED-mail posting 20110120.0236).
Thorough surveillance activities and rigorous control measures,
commendably applied by the Bulgarian authorities, have led to the
current satisfactory situation, which enabled the alleviation of the
quarantine measures.

The initial detection of FMD in a wild boar, adjacent to the Turkish
border, led to the circumstantial suspicion that the origin of this
outbreak was Turkish Thrace. There have been also other hypotheses.

The actual situation in Turkish Thrace, officially recognized by the
OIE as an "FMD-free zone with vaccination", deserves to be revisited
and thoroughly investigated. In the apparent absence of clinical
complaints/observations there, an urgent performance of a surveillance
operation, covering large and small ruminants, is prescribed. Ideally,
wildlife (particularly boars) should be included. - Mod.AS]
