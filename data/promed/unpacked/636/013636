The New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets today [16
Oct 2008] reported the finding of tuberculosis (TB) in a captive red
and fallow deer herd in Columbia County. The finding of TB is the
result of routine disease testing conducted by the Department.

While commonly thought of as a lung disease, TB may affect nearly any
organ in livestock. Animals infected with TB may at 1st look normal,
but as the disease progresses, they may become thin and weak.

During routine testing, one fallow deer in the herd had a positive
reaction to a TB screening test and was subsequently euthanized. A
postmortem examination, along with laboratory testing at the USDA
National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa
confirmed the state's diagnosis. Further testing is currently
underway to identify the specific strain of TB affecting the animal.

The presence of TB in this captive deer herd could threaten the
health of wild deer populations as well as the health of nearby
domestic animal populations. Thus, the affected herd has been
quarantined, and animals on nearby farms will undergo testing over
the next few weeks to ensure that the disease has been contained to
this one herd.

The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC)
will be looking for signs of TB in wild deer in and around Columbia
County. DEC biologists intend to examine and collect samples from
both road-killed and hunter-harvested deer to be sure the infection
has not spread to New York's wild deer population.

Hunters or others who handle deer should take basic precautions, such
as wearing protective gloves when field dressing deer and minimizing
exposure to blood and other body fluids. When field dressing deer,
hunters should be alert to abscesses in the lungs and rib cage,
intestines, liver or stomach. Anyone seeing these signs or other
unusual lesions in deer should contact DEC at 518-402-8965.

The New York State Department of Health (DOH) is also monitoring the
situation. While strains of TB affecting deer can be transmitted to
humans, there is no evidence of such in this situation.

New York State has worked for more than 70 years to earn and maintain
a TB-free status for livestock. Sporadic outbreaks of TB have
occurred since it was eradicated, with the last case in cattle
detected in 1992 and the last case in captive deer detected in 1995.
Due to the limitations of current TB tests, depopulation of animals
in infected herds is the only long term strategy to contain the
disease. In both 1992 and 1995, the disease was successfully
contained and eliminated in this manner, minimizing the impact of
these isolated outbreaks to domestic livestock populations.

Livestock owners concerned about TB are welcome to call the New York
State Department of Agriculture and Markets at 518-457-3502.

[The comment that "The presence of TB in this captive deer herd could
threaten the health of wild deer populations as well as the health of
nearby domestic animal populations" is a little odd. It is odd
because TB is a disease requiring close contact for transmission
between animals, so it is confusing to believe a fallow deer could
pass TB to nearby domestic animals, unless these animals share common
feeding grounds on the same premises.

Because TB is a slow, insidious disease, the deer may have had the
disease prior to being brought to the premises. This press release
does not tell us whether New York requires TB testing prior to
intrastate shipment. - Mod.TG]
