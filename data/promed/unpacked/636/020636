We appreciate the moderator's thoughtful commentary on our report but need
to clarify that the present serotype 5 outbreak is clearly not linked to
strain replacement associated with conjugate pneumococcal immunization.
We have previously reported dramatic reduction in IPD in children since
immunization for infants was introduced in 2003 with no evidence of strain
replacement in that group. However, the phenomenon of herd immunity
impacting distribution of disease in adults has not yet been observed in
BC. [Incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease after introduction of the
Universal Infant Immunization Program, British Columbia (2002-2005)
<http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/publicat/ccdr-rmtc/06vol32/dr3214ea.html>]
The immunized cohort is seeing no excess of serotype 5 disease. Rather, as
posted, serotype 5 disease is being seen almost exclusively in indigent
drug using adults who have had neither direct (nor as yet, indirect)
benefit from heptavalent conjugate. The outbreaks in Alberta and BC are
most likely resulting from introduction of a previously rare strain to a
uniquely susceptible group of indigent IDUs [injecting drug users] with no
prior immunity. It is unnecessary and in this case inaccurate, to ascribe
them to strain replacement associated with immunization.

[We appreciate Dr Patrick's clarification that the Vancouver cases of
invasive pneumococcal disease are occurring in an unimmunized population
(and, importantly, not occurring in the immunized cohort) and thus are
unlikely to represent serotype replacement.
It is nonetheless important to be aware of this phenomenon. As cited in the
report mentioned by Dr Patrick above, in Alberta, a rise in non-vaccine
serotype pneumococcal disease was seen in the >65 age group following
widespread introduction of heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in
children and it was noted that this "finding raises the potential of
serotype replacement as the cause of invasive disease in the >65-year age
group." We in no way meant to impugn the well-documented benefits of the
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. - Mod.LM]
