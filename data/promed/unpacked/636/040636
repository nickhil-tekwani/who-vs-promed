Fatal rabies case in the Moscow region
--------------------------------------
An emergency situation has been declared in the Noginsk area of the Moscow
region [oblast] where a fatal case of rabies has been reported. All those
who have had contact with the fatal case are under observation.

It is inferred that the deceased patient, a 42 year old man, contracted
rabies in August 2008 when he was bitten by a sick fox. He did not
immediately seek medical treatment and was admitted to hospital only much
later, when his condition had deteriorated. He died on 31 Dec 2008.
