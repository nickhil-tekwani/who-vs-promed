New blackleg threat to British crops
------------------------------------
The entire potato industry gathered in North Yorkshire [England] for
British Potato 2009 (BP2009). One of the technical seminars put on by
the Potato Council brought growers valuable information of a new
_Dickeya_ pathogen, a major new disease threat to potato production.
Scientists have discovered a new bacterial pathogen in the genus
_Dickeya_ that causes plants to wilt and tubers to rot. Symptoms are
almost indistinguishable from 'traditional' blackleg (_Pectobacterium
atrosepticum_) but the disease appears to be more aggressive and
causes damage in a wider range of conditions and at lower bacterial loadings.

The pathogen, currently referred to as '_Dickeya solani_', is a close
relative of _Dickeya dianthicola_ that has caused damage to crops on
the continent since the 1970s. But unlike _D. dianthicola_, the new
pathogen thrives under a range of conditions, according to SASA's
[Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture] Gerry Saddler.

Mark Prentice, [British] Potato Council, is keen for seed growers in
particular to help establish an adequate defence strategy. "The high
health of British seed is a huge selling point. At the heart of our
high health status lies the Safe Haven Certification Scheme. Some 60
percent of the British seed area is in the scheme and seed growers
who are members of the scheme can now have the logo printed directly
on to their seed bags. It is important that we continue to raise
awareness of plant health benefits."

Potato seed growers warned over blackleg
----------------------------------------
A recent conference warned that a particularly aggressive bacterium
is wreaking havoc among mainland European potato growers. Losses
brought about by _Dickeya solani_ rose 5-fold between 2002 and 2007
in the Netherlands, costing its industry 25 million euros latterly.
Gerry Saddler, of the Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture
agency [SASA], said that if the UK did not take action, then a
similar level of loss might be expected. Part of this loss would be
due to seed crops failing inspections with the infection. The
immediate knock-on effect would be a weakening of the seed potato
export trade, which brings, for example, about GBP 20 million [USD 33
million] annually into Scotland.

Under the more common name of blackleg, dickeya and other similar
bacteria are now the major reason seed crops are downgraded in
northern Europe. Israel also now has a major problem as a result of
imported infected seed. As a bacterial disease that likes moist
conditions, the incidence fluctuates year on year, but the overall
trend is upward. There are indications that irrigation water may also
play a role in spreading the disease.

Within 2 weeks, a consultation will be launched proposing that there
be a "nil tolerance" for crops entered for certification if the
disease is found. If this move is approved, then it will come into
force for the 2010 crop.

[Blackleg of potato caused by _Pectobacterium carotovorum_ subsp.
_atrosepticum_ (previously _Erwinia c._ subsp. _a._), as well as soft
rot caused by _Dickeya dianthicola_ (previously _Erwinia
chrysanthemi_) can cause severe losses in potato crops. However, an
even more virulent form of blackleg emerged in recent years as a
major threat spreading in Europe and Israel. The cause of this more
virulent blackleg has only been identified as a new bacterial species
earlier in 2009. The new pathogen still awaits final taxonomic
classification but is currently referred to as _Dickeya solani_.
Symptoms resemble "traditional" blackleg and include wilting of
plants and tuber rot, but the disease appears to be more aggressive
and causes damage under a wider range of conditions and at lower
bacterial loadings.

All 3 bacterial species are spread with contaminated plant or other
material, by mechanical means, and water. Disease management includes
seed tuber handling and cultural techniques, use of clean planting
material, and phytosanitation to prevent introduction of the
pathogens from external sources. Low levels of seed tuber infection
pose a major risk of pathogen spread and certification schemes are a
vital part of disease management for these pathogens.

It is feared that the new _D. solani_ will cause more damage and may
be more difficult to manage due to its adaptability to a much wider
range of growing conditions. In addition, preliminary results from
Europe indicate that, once established, the new species will rapidly
displace others and take over as the principal cause of blackleg-like
symptoms in potato crops.
