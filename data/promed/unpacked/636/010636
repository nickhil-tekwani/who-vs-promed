I must take exception to the comments from Jon Rosenberg, M.D.
His concept would allow or even encourage health officials to make
information reporting decisions that could affect human health and even
life. This sounds like censorship?
I note that the recent note on Plague in New Mexico on ProMED-mail is what
finally resulted in a CDC response. In that case, the CDC explained the
occurrence and what a person or doctor could look for as an early warning
sign (sick cats rather than rats).
If such an early report on St. Louis Encephalitis in Jefferson Parish had
been made, there is a very good chance that several of the cases might have
been avoided. Unfortunately, I started the reporting when the first victims
were already in the hospital. The health authorities only then joined the
reporting. And the local reporting never quite matched what was reported
here!
Information is important. I joined this list because the CDC was not
talking about Ebola during the last outbreak. I travel and I want to know
what I am facing when I do. Now I find that this list also addresses issues
in my own local(ity). Please keep the information flowing.
