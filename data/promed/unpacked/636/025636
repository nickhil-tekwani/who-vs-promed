Health officials in the Dominican Republic are reporting an increase in malaria cases in 2018.

According to a Diario Salud report [computer translated], 438 cases have been reported year to date compared to just 360 during the same period in 2017.

92 percent of the malaria cases were due to _Plasmodium falciparum_ and the remainder were _P. vivax_ or mixed infections.

One death has been reported.

In the last month, 31 cases of malaria have been reported, of these, 27 are indigenous and 4 are imported, 3 from Venezuela and one from Guyana.

[Autochthonous malaria has been reported from the Dominican Republic over the past 15 years, documented especially by malaria in returning visitors. The main problem is the proximity to Haiti, where malaria is endemic, and asymptomatic carriers from Haiti start local transmission in the Dominican Republic. One solution could be screening upon arrival, or if that is not possible, a course of treatment for instance with artemether/lumefantrine upon arrival, ending with a single dose of primaquine to inactivate gametocytes, as recommended by WHO (Policy brief on single-dose primaquine as a gametocytocide in _Plasmodium falciparum_ malaria. WHO, Geneva January 2015; https://www.who.int/malaria/publications/atoz/policy-brief-single-dose-primaquine-pf/en/). - Mod.EP
