[2] Rubella epidemic: Is vaccine enough? Japan

Excerpts:
Expansion of the epidemic of rubella continues. The cumulative number of patients reported by 11 Nov this year [2018] is 2032, exceeding 2000 for the 1st time in 5 years since the epidemic in 2013, when more than 14 000 patients came out.

Generally, it takes about a year and a half to manufacture MR vaccines from scratch in Japan, and the vaccine expires one year after going to the market. According to the current Japanese system, it is difficult for vaccine manufacturers and distributors to keep stocks in large quantities, except for regular vaccinations for children, and there are hundreds of thousands of annually available stocks as voluntary inoculations and emergencies.

Since October 2018, the country has asked manufacturers to add additional MR vaccines intensively to 5 prefectures in Tokyo, Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama, and Aichi prefectures where rubella is prevalent.

Women who want to become pregnant and those cohabiting family of pregnant women are preferentially vaccinated in October.

The supply of MR vaccine and rubella alone vaccine is in short supply since the outbreak of measles in Okinawa Prefecture in March this year [2018].

For adults only, we recommend MMR vaccination.

Although the government has set the goal of "eliminating rubella in 20 years," the disease can affect the Tokyo Olympic Games as well as preventing the attainment of the goal as it is. On 22 Oct 2018, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that pregnant women who had no vaccination or past history of infection not travel to Japan because rubella was prevalent there.

The country has a responsibility to take specific measures to stop the outbreak of rubella, but the epidemic continues to expand, and it is also necessary for individuals to take action to prevent infection. People who live in endemic areas and who lack rubella antibodies should undergo antibody testing and vaccination.

When a woman up to about 20 weeks gestation is infected with rubella virus, a baby born may develop a disease called "congenital rubella syndrome," with heart disease, deafness or cataracts. Because pregnant women cannot receive rubella vaccines, women who do not have antibodies need to be vaccinated twice before pregnancy. Because some people cannot be vaccinated due to immunodeficiency etc., it is necessary to prevent rubella outbreaks in society as a whole.

[Rubella cases in Japan closely monitored (in Hong Kong): The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) [in Hong Kong] is closely monitoring an increase in the number of rubella (also known as "German measles") cases in Japan and appealed to the travellers and members of the public for vigilance and reiterated that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the disease.

According to the information from the health authority of Japan, an ongoing outbreak of rubella is being observed in the country. A total of 1289 cases of rubella have been recorded in 2018 (as of 17 Oct 2018) with 914 cases reported in the past 6 weeks, as compared to 93, 126 and 163 cases recorded in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Among these 1289 cases in 2018, 1062 (82.4%) were affected males with 63% of them aged between 30-49 years. The cumulative incidence in 2018 was highest in Chiba (37.6 cases per million population), followed by Tokyo (32 cases per million population) and Kanagawa (17.9 cases per million population).

Immunisation against rubella is the most effective way to prevent the disease. People who intend to travel to Japan are advised to review their vaccination history and past medical history. People who had received rubella-containing vaccine documented by vaccination record, past history of laboratory confirmed rubella infection, or positive blood test for rubella antibody are considered to be immune against rubella. Otherwise, they can be considered as non-immune to rubella.

"As rubella-containing vaccine is contraindicated in pregnant women, all pregnant women and women preparing for pregnancy who are non-immune to rubella should not travel to Japan during the outbreak period," a spokesman for the CHP said on 23 Oct 2018.

For those without rubella vaccination, with unknown vaccination history or unknown immunity against rubella, they are advised to consult their doctor for advice on vaccination, which is usually given together with mumps and rubella vaccines as the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) combined vaccine. As it takes about 2 weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop and provide protection against rubella, non-immune travellers are advised to plan and get vaccinated ahead, except pregnant women and women preparing for pregnancy (Excerpted from https://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/201810/23/P2018102300850.htm).

Japan has not had a consistent vaccination policy against measles, mumps, rubella, and as a result, there are pockets of non-immune, susceptible individuals in the country. See the following publication:

Y Tanaka et al. History repeats itself in Japan: Failure to learn from rubella epidemic leads to failure to provide the HPV vaccine. Hum Vaccin Immunother. 2017 Jul; 13(8): 1859-1860. doi: [10.1080/21645515.2017.1327929].

Due to gaps in herd immunization resulting from politicized transitions in vaccination policy by the [Japanese] government, there were outbreaks of rubella with 17 050 cases reported between the years of 2012 and 2014 and 45 cases of congenital rubella syndrome reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance of Infectious Diseases from week 1, 2012 to week 40, 2014. Currently, the majority of recent rubella epidemic cases are occurring among adults aged 20-40. There still exist large populations susceptible to rubella in Japan. - Mod.LK
