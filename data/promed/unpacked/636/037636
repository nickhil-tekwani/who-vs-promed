[1] COVID-19 in minks, Greece, 1st outbreaks

Greek authorities have found COVID-19 in mink at 2 farms in northern Greece, an agriculture ministry official said on Fri 13 Nov 2020.

The COVID-19 strain in mink had not mutated, the official said, adding that 2500 mink at one farm in the northern Kozani region would be culled.

The discovery comes days after Danish authorities launched a plan to cull Denmark's entire population of 17 million mink after discovering a different strain of coronavirus in the animals.

The breeder at the farm had also contracted coronavirus, and tests were being conducted on workers, the official said.

Fur trade is an important local industry in Kozani and nearby Kastoria, where the 2nd farm is located. The population of mink is estimated at hundreds of thousands in Greece

[2] OIE updated assessment of COVID-19 in animals
Date: Thu 12 Nov 2020

https://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/oie-statement-on-covid-19-and-mink/?fbclid=IwAR3y6B84EzR7lhyFfH-XIy8zg8aafPXm0E0-6RdxBw7X103FzR5v0X9P4Ac&cHash=83a7e5fc23


The risk of susceptible animals, such as mink, becoming a SARS-CoV-2 reservoir is generating worldwide concern, as it could pose a continued public health risk and lead to future spillover events to humans. Recent surveillance findings in Denmark suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, introduced into minks through contact with humans, is evolving through viral mutation and has been reintroduced to humans.

The OIE acknowledges that such events could have important public health implications. While the COVID-19 pandemic is currently sustained through human-to-human transmission, there are concerns that the introduction and circulation of new virus strains in humans could result in modifications of transmissibility or virulence and decreased treatment and vaccine efficacy. Yet, the full consequences remain unknown, and further investigation is needed to fully understand the impact of these mutations.

Close collaboration between animal and public health authorities is imperative to better identify and reduce the impact of this disease. Furthermore, a global One Health approach is needed to understand risks for animal and human health as well as ecosystem health as a whole.

The OIE calls on countries to protect animal health and welfare, and consequently public health, by implementing effective risk management measures. Actions should be taken to:

- Prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between humans and susceptible animals, by implementing national risk reduction strategies;
- Monitor susceptible animals, such as mink and racoon dogs, as well as humans in close contact with them, for SARS-CoV-2 infection, adopting a One Health approach. Active monitoring is recommended as it might be difficult to detect early infections in these animals, especially mink;
- Report animal cases to the OIE through the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS);
- Share genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from animals and other research findings with the global health community.

To support countries in the implementation of these measures, the OIE has developed guidelines for people working with susceptible farmed animals as well as with wild mammals in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The OIE will continue to engage with its members, experts and partners, notably the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), to update technical guidance as new scientific findings and information become available.

[Greece has become the 7th country detecting COVID-19 in its farmed minks (map presenting the 2 locations, at https://tinyurl.com/yyypujrh). It follows Netherlands, Denmark, Spain, USA, Italy and Sweden. The situation in other mink-farming countries is yet to be revealed.

There is no direct reference to farmed minks in OIE's Code; the reporting of COVID-19 in minks is based upon its definition as an "emerging" disease and of mink as being an "animal." OIE is intensively engaged in combatting this emerging zoonotic disease in animals (details in OIE's COVID-19 Portal at https://tinyurl.com/wfpedwb).

OIE's WAHIS interface presents, in the section "country information" the sub-section "animal population," in which the figures submitted by each member country in its obligatory annual report are presented. The downloaded table, per country, includes animal numbers, density, and number of their establishments in the country/region (See https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Countryinformation/Animalpopulation; select a region/country/year). Minks are not included, though being farmed in some countries for generations (e.g., in North America since the 1860's, in Denmark since the 1920's), and known to be currently farmed in dozens of countries.

Allowing the inclusion of minks in the WAHIS database and encouraging member countries to submit the relevant figures (numbers of breeding minks and of their farms/holdings) deserve to be considered; this may support the implementation of the actions recommended in the above OIE document; in particular, active monitoring and reporting.

The Greek cases in minks, including their epidemiological and clinical aspects, are yet to be reported to the OIE. - Mod.AS
