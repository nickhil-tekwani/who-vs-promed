Outbreak of foot and mouth disease suspected in the province of Salta,
state of Tartagal
--------------------------------------------
Last Saturday, the National Agrifood Health and Quality Service (SENASA)
issued a statement announcing that a case of foot and mouth disease (FMD)
is suspected in the province of Salta in the state of Tartagal.
The statement indicates that lesions were detected on the feet of pigs that
were being held in a municipal slaughterhouse in Salta. Once the disease
was suspected, samples were obtained to confirm the diagnosis and, with the
assistance of the national police, measures were implemented in accordance
with current regulations.
The statement by SENASA added that the area presumably affected is located
in a zone that has been established under a sanitary alert with the
"purpose of protecting the rest of the national territory, in light of the
outbreaks during July [2003] in the neighboring countries of Bolivia and
Paraguay."
In these areas, all species susceptible to the disease are vaccinated, and
an intensive control program that includes the reporting of suspected
outbreaks is being implemented. SENASA has informed the international
sanitary organizations, and professionals from the Pan-American Center for
Foot and Mouth Disease will visit the area over the coming days in order to
carry out a joint evaluation.
On 7 July [2003], the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) declared
most of Argentina's territory "free of foot and mouth disease with
vaccination", since there were no outbreaks registered in the country for a
period of 18 months <http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en_fmd.htm>.
In July 2003, outbreaks of the disease -- which does not affect humans but
causes enormous economic losses to the [dairy] cattle and beef industries
-- were detected in the border zones of Paraguay and Bolivia with
Argentina. Since then, SENASA declared a sanitary alert in the region, with
a series of measures that include the revaccination of thousands of heads
of cattle and swine and the control of movement of animals along the borders.

No foot and mouth disease in Salta
----------------------------------
"The epidemiological survey produced no evidence that suggests that we are
facing an outbreak of foot and mouth disease." Such was the statement of
SENASA on 31 Aug 2003 regarding the suspicion of an outbreak of the disease
in Salta, Tartagal. In any case, the agency is awaiting the results of the
analysis of the samples obtained.

[The authorities were prudent to act so swiftly. There are other diseases
-- such as vesicular stomatitis -- that produce lesions similar to those
caused by FMD and testing is required to make the distinction. We await
official confirmation of the eventual test results. - Mod.TG]
