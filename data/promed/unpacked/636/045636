SEA LION DIE-OFF - SUB-ANTARCTICA
*********************************

At least 700 New Zealand sea lion pups and five cows have been found dead
on Dundas Island, near Antarctica. The pups represented about 30% of the
breeding colony on the island, part of the Auckland Islands, 200 miles
south of New Zealand.

The New Zealand sea lion, with an existing population of 11,000 to 15,000
is one of the most threatened species of sea lion. Mike Donoghue, of the
Department of Conservation, indicated that this die-off is worrisome and
that efforts will be made to determine its etiology. Possible causes being
considered at this time are viruses, bacteria and toxic algal blooms.
Results of preliminary testing should be available in about three weeks.

Dozens of Hooker sea lion breeding cows may be the casualties of the as yet
undiagnosed disease that is killing that endangered species in the
sub-Antarctic Islands. Only 20 cows had returned after their normal two
days at sea to feed pups on Enderby Island yesterday, when normally 150
should have been on shore.
Department of Conservation spokesman Mike Donoghue said if the cows had
died or were dying at sea it would be disastrous for the long-term recovery
of the Hooker sea lion population which may be already decimated by the
disease. Of the 350 to 400 pups normally on Enderby, scientists counted 111
dead and 150 were unaccounted for yesterday, he said. Nineteen percent of
the adult population was also affected by the disease, which starts with
lesions and progresses to paralysis before death.
Rough weather yesterday stopped scientists going to assess the situation at
nearby Dundas Island where 80% of the Hooker breeding population lives.
Seven hundred dead pups were found there on Thursday.
Samples are being examined at Massey University, but it will be two weeks
before any results are known.
The squid fishing season began yesterday amid criticism from the Forest and
Bird Protection Society and Greenpeace. Squid fishing industry spokesman
Andrew Branson said operators were told to be careful and watch out for sea
lions. However he did not see why the season should be put on hold by what
was happening to the sea lion population.
"This event seems to be occurring by natural means. Fishing hasn't had
anything to do with it," he said. Under the Fisheries Act a specified
number of accidental sea lion kills is allowed before the fishery is closed
down. Last year it was 64. However, a figure hasn't been set for this
season because of the disease. Last year, the season was closed early
because too many sea lions were caught in nets. It was estimated $20m of
[the squid] quota was uncaught.
