The [New South Wales (NSW) State] Department of Primary Industries (DPI) has issued a warning to dog owners, following a recent spate of serious brucellosis (_Brucella suis_) infections in dogs.

DPI Senior Veterinary Officer Pigs and Poultry, Amanda Lee, said 4 dogs in NSW have recently tested positive for the _Brucella suis_ strain of the disease, which originates in pigs.

"Brucellosis (_Brucella suis_) is a serious infectious disease of pigs that can be passed on to other animals and people through contact with urine, blood, saliva and reproductive materials," Dr Lee said.

"Two pig hunting dogs in north-western NSW have recently tested positive for brucellosis after suspected contact with an infected feral pig in the Moree area. Both dogs presented separately to private veterinarians with clinical signs suggestive of brucellosis infection, including fever, enlarged lymph nodes and enlarged testicles."

DPI has been assisted by Local Land Services in the investigations.

Dr Lee said 2 other cases highlight the risk of brucellosis being transmitted to pups at birth.

"We've also confirmed that a Bull Arab cross living in Sydney [NSW], and a Great Dane cross pup in Walgett [NSW] have tested positive for this disease," Dr Lee said. "Neither of the dogs have had any known contact with feral pigs, and we suspect the disease may have been passed on by their mother at birth. It is a crucial reminder for people to be aware of their animal's history and to purchase or obtain pups from reputable breeders."

DPI recommends that dogs confirmed infected with brucellosis be euthanased because of the potential risk to people.

Director of Communicable Diseases Branch NSW Health Dr Vicky Sheppeard said NSW Health is in contact with the owners of the infected dogs and vets who treated the dogs.

"Brucellosis in humans is a potentially fatal disease, and symptoms may include intermittent fever, sweating, lethargy, loss of appetite, headache, and back pain," Dr Sheppeard said. "It is essential that people who are at an increased risk of brucellosis infection, including feral pig hunters, farm workers, vets and abattoir workers, practice good personal hygiene and wear protective clothing when in close contact with potentially infected animals."

Owners who are concerned that their dog may have signs of Brucellosis should contact their local veterinarian to have it assessed. The veterinarian will notify a Local Land Services inspector or an inspector with DPI if they consider the case suspect for brucellosis.

[Brucellosis is a bacterial infection caused by Gram-negative coccobacillus (short rods).

Brucellosis is a serious, globally distributed zoonotic disease. Humans are susceptible to infection by _Brucella suis_, _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_, and _B. canis_, and can have lifelong symptoms of undulating fever, enlarged lymph nodes, malaise, and arthritis.

Consumption of unpasteurized dairy products confers the highest risk for brucellosis in disease-endemic areas. However, hunters and owners of hunting dogs are at high risk for transmission of brucellosis from wildlife. Sporadic transmission of _B. canis_ from pet dogs to their owners has been reported. We caution the public about the potential for transmission to humans in contact with infected dogs and wild hogs.

Smooth _Brucella_ spp. express the immunodominant O side chain on the lipopolysaccharide of their surface. Therefore, this side chain forms the antigenic basis of diagnostic tests, such as the card test. The _B. abortus_ plate antigen (BAPA) test can detect smooth species. Because _B. canis_ does not express the O side chain on its surface, serologic tests for _B. canis_ differ from tests for _B. abortus_, _B. suis_, or _B. melitensis_. Therefore, _B. suis_-infected dogs are unlikely to have positive results for _B. canis_ tests and vice versa.

Although transmission of _B. suis_ from dogs to humans has not been reported, _B. suis_ is 2nd only to _B. melitensis_ in its pathogenicity to humans. Therefore, dogs exposed to feral hogs should be tested for _Brucella_ spp. and monitored for clinical signs, while keeping in mind that sensitivity and specificity of _B. abortus_-specific tests is unknown. If a pet is infected with _B. canis_, a long course of antimicrobial drugs and spaying or neutering to prevent breeding is advisable but might not be completely effective.

Because _B. suis_ is more pathogenic to humans than _B. canis_, and its mechanisms of pathogenesis in dogs can vary, the same recommendations might not be true for _B. suis_-infected dogs. Given the serious zoonotic implications of _B. suis_ infections, euthanasia of the affected pet may be advocated by regulatory agencies and physicians treating exposed humans.

Little information, including that for pathogenesis or duration of bacteremia, is available for _B. suis_ infections in dogs. Therefore, blood cultures might not reliably detect _B. suis_-infected dogs. For _B. canis_ infections, only animals certified free of _Brucella_ spp. by 2 consecutive serologic or blood culture tests conducted 4-6 weeks apart can be used as breeding stock in kennels. If an outbreak occurs in a kennel, all infected animals should be isolated and euthanized after showing positive test results. The premises should also be thoroughly disinfected before restocking.
