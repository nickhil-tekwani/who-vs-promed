Trichinellosis in pigs and humans from New Zealand
---------------------------------------------------
The parasite _Trichinella_ (assumed _T. spiralis_, to be confirmed) has
been found in home killed pig meat derived from a farm in Whangamata,
Coromandel and 2 people have been hospitalised with symptoms of
trichinosis. Pig meat consumed by the 2 people has tested positive by
pepsin digest for _Trichinella_, the cause of trichinosis.
The Ministries of Agriculture and Forestry (MAF) and Health are cooperating
in the investigation.
The suspected cases involve the farmer and his neighbour, both from
Whangamata, Coromandel. They both consumed meat from a domestic pig
slaughtered at the farm and butchered by a local butcher.
The farm has been declared a Restricted Place under the Biosecurity Act,
preventing the movement of live pigs and pig meat off the property.
Leftover meat has been impounded. The farm is not a commercial pig farm.
All pigs on the property (30, including 5 captured feral pigs) will be
blood tested (ELISA) and restrictions will remain on the property until it
has been completely destocked of pigs. All pigs will be subject to pepsin
digest on muscle samples during destocking. Tracing movements of live pigs
and pig meat from the farm is being undertaken, as will surveillance in
feral rats and cats, to determine where the infection has come from. The
captured feral pigs present on the farm have been destroyed, and have
tested positive by pepsin digest on diaphragmatic muscle.
Trichinosis is notifiable to both the public and animal health authorities
in New Zealand. _Trichinella spiralis_ is known to occur at low levels in
wildlife cycles in parts of New Zealand, involving rats, cats, and feral
pigs. Spill-overs into domestic pigs and humans are rare events. The last
case in pigs was in 1997, and in humans 1964. An assurance surveillance
programme operates for export and domestic market.
Information on the animal health status of New Zealand with respect to
_Trichinella spiralis_ can be found in the following two publications:
Liberona HE, MacDiarmid SC. _Trichinella spiralis_ in New Zealand.
Surveillance 15 (1) 17-18. 1988.
Paterson K, Black A, Reichel MP. Porcine trichinosis diagnosed in the
Rotorua area. Surveillance 24 (4) 6-8. 1997.

[Trichinellosis was last found in pigs in New Zealand in 1997. It is
important that the authorities send samples of the larvae to the WHO/FAO
Trichinella Reference Centre in Rome. - Mod.EP]
