Pet rats as a source of hantavirus in England and Wales, 2013
-------------------------------------------------------------

Background
----------
We report the detection of a strain of Seoul hantavirus (SEOV) in pet rats in England and Wales. The discovery followed an investigation of a case of haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Wales. Hantavirus RNA was detected via real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and classic RT-PCR in pet rats belonging to the patient. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the virus to be a SEOV that is similar, but not identical, to a previously reported United Kingdom strain from wild rats.

In January 2013, a male patient in north Wales suffering from acute kidney injury and clinically presenting with haemorrhagic fever and renal syndrome, tested seropositive (IgG 1:10 000) for Seoul (SEOV) and Hantaan (HTNV) hantavirus using indirect immunofluorescence (Euroimmun, Germany). A previous blood sample from October 2012, taken for unrelated purposes, was retrospectively obtained and tested. This sample demonstrated no antibody to hantavirus thus confirming seroconversion as defined by Heyman et al., 2007 [1]. Epidemiological assessment identified the patient's 2 pet agouti rats (_Rattus norvegicus_) as a possible source of the hantavirus.

Virus investigation
-------------------
Due to the patient's serious clinical condition the pet rats were in the care of the original breeder in England (Oxfordshire). They were housed in a separate building to that of the breeder's pet rat colony. Blood samples from both rats, and urine from one of the 2 rats, were obtained and processed for RNA extraction using RNeasy kit (Qiagen). The extract was tested using a modified version of a previously published real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for the dual detection of HTNV and SEOV [2].

The urine and blood samples tested positive and results were rapidly communicated to the incident control team, which included representatives from Health Protection Agency (HPA, Porton and Colindale), Thames Valley Health Protection Unit (HPU), Public Health Wales (PHW), Environmental Health (EH) and Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA). Due to uncertainties regarding the prevalence of this virus within the pet rat population in the United Kingdom (UK), the nature of its transmission, and the potential seriousness of human disease in this particular instance, the owner's consent was obtained to euthanize the 2 pet rats and remove them for further testing at the HPA Porton.

One of the rats was processed as previously described [3] and viral RNA sourced directly from lung tissue was subjected to additional characterisation of the virus through standard Sanger sequencing on a 3130xl sequencer (Life Technologies). Sequencing of the S segment was achieved, confirming the virus was indeed a strain of SEOV similar, but not identical, to previously isolated UK SEOV strains: Humber (wild rats) [3] and IR461 (laboratory rats) [4]. We have provisionally designated this [new] strain 'Cherwell'. Comparisons between Cherwell and Humber S segments highlighted a total of 47 nucleotide differences, 36 within the open reading frame (ORF) resulting in one amino acid difference (methionine to isoleucine) at position 247. Phylogenetic analysis placed the Cherwell S segment within the same group as the corresponding segments of Humber and IR46. The sequence (1769 nucleotides) was released to GenBank under accession number KC626089.

Following confirmation of hantavirus infection in these 2 rats, blood samples were obtained with the owner's permission, from 21 of the breeding colony rats and processed in the same way. Guidance was provided to the breeder to minimise the potential risk of infection while caring for the remaining rats, should they be positive. On the day of sampling, 7/21 rats had detectable RNA specific to HTNV/SEOV in blood. Preliminary sequence data indicates the same Cherwell strain in these rats.

Investigation of human contacts with rats
-----------------------------------------
A blood sample was obtained from the patient's partner in Wales; this was negative for IgG antibodies. Blood samples were also obtained from the breeder and her spouse in England. The breeder, who had most contact with the rats in the breeding colony, had a low positive titre to HTNV and SEOV (IgG 1: 100). The breeder's spouse tested strongly positive with an IgG titre of 1: 10 000 to HTNV and SEOV, strongly suggesting hantavirus infection. Retrospective investigation of his medical records showed that he had been admitted to hospital in late 2011 with an undiagnosed viral illness resulting in acute renal impairment and thrombocytopenia. It is now considered highly likely that this was due to hantavirus infection; an archived blood sample from this admission was retrospectively tested and demonstrated an IgG titre of 1: 1000 to HTNV and SEOV.

In summary, of 4 people exposed to this particular population of rats, 2 had been clinically ill with renal impairment and were strongly seropositive, one had a low level of antibody with no clinical illness, and one was seronegative.

Discussion and conclusions
--------------------------
In January 2013, we reported the isolation of a UK strain of SEOV (Humber) from wild rats in north-east England (Jameson LJ, Logue CH, Atkinson B, Baker N, Galbraith SE, Carroll MW, et al. The continued emergence of hantaviruses: isolation of a Seoul virus implicated in human disease, United Kingdom, October 2012. Euro Surveill. 2013;18(1):pii=20344. Available from: http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20344 PMid:23305714). We now report a 2nd SEOV strain from the UK which is similar, but genetically distinct from the Humber isolate and laboratory-associated IR461 isolate. Further research will continue to investigate the relationship of these 3 strains. The pet rats identified in this investigation are part of a wider pet rat community which partakes in national and international shows and fosters international sharing of rats. Currently, the prevalence of SEOV in the UK pet rat community is unknown, but if SEOV infection was widespread, there would be implications for the wider (non-UK) pet rat community.

[Previously [see: See: Seoul virus - United Kingdom: (England) 1st detection 20130104.1482194] Moderator TY commented that the appearance of Seoul virus in England is not surprising, given its wide distribution around the world and the propensity of brown rats to move along routes of international commerce, most often by cargo ships, which accounts for the presence of Seoul virus in brown rats in port cities. This new Eurosurveillance report gives further support for that observation.

Hantaviruses are viruses that exist predominantly in wild rodents. When transmitted to humans, they can cause the clinical syndromes, hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS] or hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome [HPS]. Previously one of these hantaviruses, Seoul virus, had been detected in wild rodents in the north of England [J Med Virol. 1994;43] and in Northern Ireland [McKenna P, Clement J, Matthys P, Coyle PV, McCaughey C. Serological evidence of Hantavirus disease in Northern Ireland. J Med Virol. 1994;43(1):33-8]. In the present report a hantavirus, identified as Seoul virus, has been isolated from a patient in Wales with serious kidney diseases, contracted from a pet rat which had been obtained from a rat breeder in the English Midlands, whose rat colony contained Seoul virus-infected animals

This is further confirmation of the presence of Seoul virus in the UK, and its potential as a human pathogen beyond Asia. Given that _Rattus norvegicus_ is ubiquitous in the UK, it will be important to determine the extent of human exposure to this virus. These findings confirm the existence of a hantavirus in the UK and will allow further studies to evaluate its prevalence as a human pathogen.
