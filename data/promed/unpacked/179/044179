U.S. flu outbreaks in the rise
The winter flu season is rapidly getting worse, with influenza outbreaks
occurring in 26 states, federal health experts said Thursday. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the number of states
reporting outbreaks rose from 10 to 26 in two weeks. Arizona, Colorado, New
York, Tennessee and Texas were most affected, the agency said. Influenza
outbreaks were also reported in Alabama, Alaska, California, Connecticut,
Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan,
Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Dakota, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia. Most
of the outbreaks have been in nursing homes, though there also have been
outbreaks among children and young adults, the CDC said. A new flu strain,
seen for the first time in Australia and New Zealand during June 1997, has
been detected in California, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Missouri, New
York, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. The CDC said this
winter's flu vaccine provides protection against the new Type A/Sydney
strain but it may be "less than optimal." The new strain is very similar to
another strain included in the vaccine, the agency said.
