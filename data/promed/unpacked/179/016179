[This is a formal confirmation of what was reported earlier in the local
newspapers. From this brief account it is hard to tell whether the 3 other
villages affected were as a result of contaminated meat purchased in
Sukhbazar (which the modest case numbers would indicate), or whether each
of those villages had livestock deaths. It is similarly difficult to
interpret what "P.H. measures taken" means -- whether the remains of the
butchered cow were just left at the "dumping ground" or whether they were
buried "in" the dumping ground. It would have been better if this cow and
the others had been burnt at the dumping ground. Burial is seldom deep
enough, and dogs and other canids will soon excavate and scatter a
shallowly buried carcass. And the remains of any butchered carcass will be
rich in spores. - Mod.MHJ]
