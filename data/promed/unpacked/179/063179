Queensland health authorities have issued an alert to residents living in the Brisbane area after another measles case was identified. The Queensland Health Service and Metro South Hospital were made aware of the case yesterday [28 Feb 2019]. It is understood the infected person visited multiple locations on Brisbane's south side between 16 Feb and 23 Feb 2019 [full list of the locations can be found at the URL above].

The alert marks the 32nd measles outbreak case around the country since Christmas [25 Dec 2018] and the 2nd in Queensland. A person travelling back to Australia from South East Asia was identified as the state's 1st case just 2 weeks ago after presenting to the Sunshine Coast Hospital on 16 Feb 2019. Around Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia have recorded the highest numbers of infected people with 27 cases identified across both states.

A total of 203 patients who contracted measles in 2019 have died as of [22 Feb 2019], the Department of Health said on Friday [1 Mar 2019]. The number of measles cases between January and February 2019 was at 13 470, health spokesperson undersecretary Eric Domingo told radio DZMM. There were only 4300 cases in the 1st week of February [2019]. Most of the cases were recorded in the National Capital Region, Cagayan, and Mimaropa, Domingo said.

The government declared a measles outbreak early February [2019] after hundreds of children contracted the airborne disease in Metro Manila and parts of Central Luzon and Central Visayas. The measles outbreak may wane in April [2019] as the DoH moves to vaccinate some 12 million Filipinos against the disease, health secretary Francisco Duque III said earlier. The Department of Education is also considering a "no vaccination, no enrolment policy" to push more parents to avail of anti-measles shots.

Some 32% of 1500 Filipinos had trust in vaccines, a poll conducted by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 2018 showed. A vaccine scare triggered by an allegedly deadly dengue vaccine may have triggered further distrust in the government's immunization program, Duque said in an earlier interview.

A case of measles has been discovered in Auckland, prompting health authorities to begin contacting patients who may have been exposed to the highly contagious disease. On Thursday [28 Feb 2019], the Auckland Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) warned that it had been notified of an individual with measles who attended the Clendon Medical Centre on 3 occasions between 19 Feb and 21 Feb [2019].

The increasing measles outbreak has infected about 1300 people with one death across Myanmar as of mid-February this year [2019], an official from the Public Health Department told Xinhua on Wednesday [27 Feb 2019]. In early February [2019], a child under 5 years old died of encephalitis, a complication caused by the measles, in the Mandalay region.

The Yangon region accounted for about 50% of nationwide cases due to the lack of full immunization coverage in some townships, said Dr Aung Naing Oo, assistant director of the Central Extended Immunization Division under the Public Health Department. The outbreak is occurring mainly in the townships of Hlaingthayar, Shwepyithar, Dagon Seikkan, and South Dagon in Yangon.

The Ministry of Health and Sports is conducting a measles vaccination drive for children aged between 19 months and 15 years. About 1276 laboratory-confirmed cases of measles, a potentially serious infectious disease caused by the measles virus, were reported in Myanmar in the whole of 2018.

[Measles immunization was initiated in Myanmar during 1987, with the 1st dose targeting children under 9 months http://www.searo.who.int/myanmar/areas/immunization_measlescampaign/en/. Although measles infection mainly affects young children, the people who were born before 1987 or who opted out prior to the full implementation of the immunization program are susceptible to the infection as well. - Mod.YMA

https://www.radio.cz/en/section/panorama/measles-outbreak-in-czech-republic-as-vaccination-rate-drops-below-protective-threshold


The World Health Organization [WHO] is ringing alarm bells as an increasing number of European countries, including the Czech Republic, are fighting an outbreak of measles. Measles cases in Europe tripled in 2018, and the reasons are the same: immunization hesitancy, which has interfered with maintaining a high coverage rate in the population, and greater movement of people.

WHO reports that before the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, major outbreaks were a common global occurrence, with 2-3 outbreaks occurring annually. These outbreaks led to approximately 2.6 million deaths each year. Since the MMR vaccine was introduced, the numbers decreased to almost zero, and in countries with a high coverage rate of around 95%, measles was practically eradicated.

In the last decade, doctors have registered an increase again around Europe and more recently in the USA. This is directly linked to the fact that an increasing number of parents are refusing to get their children vaccinated for fear of side effects. The link between low vaccination rates and outbreaks is well established and documented by WHO data on immunization rates and outbreaks. France, Italy, Greece, and Romania are suffering severe epidemics; the Baltic and Scandinavian countries have very few cases and some months record no cases.

In the Czech Republic, the outbreaks are fairly recent. In 2016 there were just 7 cases registered. In 2017 it was 142 cases, and in 2018, it was 182 cases. In January and February of this year [2019] the number has already reached close to 100 cases, with 70 of them registered in Prague. Epidemiologist Zdenka Jagrova says that, given the growing hesitancy to immunization in Europe and the spread of the disease from country to country, the situation is serious. In 2007, the Czech Republic had an immunization rate of 98%. However, since 2013 it has dropped steadily. In 2017 it was just 84%. And now it is reported to be as low as 73% in some areas. According to Hana Cabrnochova, the deputy chair of the Czech Immunization Association, parents are seriously underestimating the risk of refusing to get their children vaccinated.

https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2019/measles-outbreak-now-at-121-cases.page


The Health Department today [28 Feb 2019] announced the measles outbreak in the Orthodox Jewish community is now at 121 cases since the outbreak began in October [2018]. The vast majority of cases are children under 18 years of age (108 cases), and 13 cases are adults. There are no deaths associated with this outbreak, although there have been complications, including 8 hospitalizations and one child who was in the intensive care unit. Of the 121 cases, 31 are newly identified, including 5 diagnosed in the past week and 26 who were identified retrospectively (that is, they recently had the illness and were identified after symptoms subsided). Most cases have been reported from zip codes in Borough Park and Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Four cases, including the initial case of measles, acquired measles on a visit to Israel, where a large outbreak of the disease is occurring. One case was acquired from the UK and one from Ukraine.

Since the outbreak began, the department has worked with elected officials, community organizations, and religious leaders to conduct extensive outreach in the community to educate residents in these zip codes about the risks associated with measles and the importance of vaccination. This effort has resulted in over 7000 people receiving the MMR vaccine. In December [2018], the department announced mandatory exclusions for students in selected zip codes in Borough Park and Williamsburg who have not received the required number of doses of MMR vaccine.

Twenty-one of the 31 additional cases are connected to a single yeshiva in Williamsburg. This yeshiva went out of compliance with the Health Department's exclusion order in mid-January [2019], allowing an unvaccinated student who had measles but had not yet begun presenting symptoms.

Last week, the Department expanded vaccination recommendations for providers serving the Orthodox Jewish community to include an early, extra dose of the MMR vaccine for children aged 6-11 months who live in Williamsburg and Borough Park.

UNICEF warned today that global cases of measles are surging to alarmingly high levels, led by 10 countries [see URL], accounting for more than 74% of the total increase, and several others that had previously been declared measles-free. Globally, 98 countries reported more cases of measles in 2018 than in 2017, eroding progress against this highly preventable, but potentially deadly disease.

Poor health infrastructure, civil strife, low community awareness, complacency, and vaccine hesitancy in some cases have led to these outbreaks in both developed and developing countries. For example, in the USA, the number of measles cases increased 6-fold between 2017 and 2018, reaching 791 cases. More recently, the USA has seen outbreaks in New York and Washington state.

"Almost all of these cases are preventable, and yet children are getting infected even in places where there is simply no excuse," said Fore. "Measles may be the disease, but all too often, the real infection is misinformation, mistrust, and complacency. We must do more to accurately inform every parent to help us safely vaccinate every child."

To fight measles, UNICEF is issuing an urgent appeal to governments, healthcare providers, and parents to do more to contain the disease by
- understanding that vaccines are safe and effective and can save a child's life;
- vaccinating all children between the ages of 6 months to 5 years during outbreaks;
- training and equipping health workers so they can provide quality services; and
- strengthening immunization programmes to deliver all lifesaving vaccines.

About the Measles and Rubella Initiative
-------
UNICEF is part of the Measles and Rubella Initiative, a private-public partnership of 5 global partners including WHO, CDC, United Nations Foundation, and American Red Cross that have been spearheading a global push towards measles and rubella elimination.

[8] US Congressional testimonies

https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/rep-degette-leads-hearing-on-measles-outbreak-and-vaccinations


On Wednesday [27 Feb], US representative Diana DeGette (D [Democrat]-Colorado) chaired a hearing in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce to discuss the current nationwide measles outbreak and concerns about vaccine hesitancy. As of 21 Feb [2019], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 159 cases of measles in 10 states.

Before the hearing, DeGette said lawmakers will consider the need for new, stricter federal regulations regarding vaccine exemptions. She noted that Colorado's kindergarten MMR vaccination rate of 89% is among the lowest in the country. Colorado is one of 17 states that allow an exemption for personal beliefs, in addition to religious and medical exemptions.

The hearing included testimony from 2 top health officials: Dr Nancy Messonnier [from CDC] and Dr Anthony Fauci from the National Institutes of Health [NIH]. Both agreed the spread of measles continues to be a public health concern in the USA, even though the disease was declared eliminated in the USA in the early 2000s. Outbreaks in multiple states in recent years have reignited concerns about "anti-vax" parents who chose not to vaccinate their children.
