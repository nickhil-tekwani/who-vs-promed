A Survey of Citrus Viroids in Campania (Southern Italy).

Within a certification program of citrus, a survey covering 14 citrus
fields not previously screened were randomly selected in seven areas of the
Campania Region of southern Italy to evaluate the presence and distribution
of citrus viroids in the region.
During the last 3 years, 112 trees were visually inspected and sampled
including 14 'Navelina', 8 'Washington navel', 13 'Biondo Commune', 10
'Tarocco', 6 'Valencia late', 1 'Sanguinello', and 1 'Vanilla' sweet
oranges (_Citrus sinensis_), four sour oranges (_C. aurantium_), 21
'Commune' and 7 'Monreale' clementines (_C. clementina_), 8 'Common' and 2
'Avana' mandarins (_C. reticulata_), 8 'Ovale di Sorrento' and 6 'Zagara'
lemons (_C. lemon_), 2 Tangelos (_C. reticulata_ x _C. paradisi_), and 1
grapefruit (_C. paradisi_). Nearly all (37 of 38) mandarin and clementine
trees showed cachexia-like symptoms.
Severe bark scaling that is characteristic of exocortis disease was
observed on a single 'Ovale di Sorrento' lemon, the only tree incidentally
found to be grafted onto the exocortis-sensitive trifoliate orange
(_Poncirus trifoliata_) rootstock, since sour orange (_C. aurantium_) is
the main rootstock used in Campania. Samples (104 of 112) that had been
graft-inoculated into Arizona 861-S1 'Etrog citron' (_C. medica L._) on
rough lemon (_C. jambhiri Lush._) rootstock showed typical viroid symptoms.
Viroid infection was confirmed by sequential polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis analysis (2) and molecular hybridization of imprinted
membranes (1).
Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd), Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), and Citrus viroid
III (CVd-III) were the most frequently detected, accounting respectively,
for 67.9, 86.6, and 84.8 percent of the infected samples. Citrus viroid IV
(CVd-IV) and Citrus bent leaf viroid (CBLVd) were found in 24.1 and 13.4
percent of the sources. CBLVd was detected in sweet orange ('Tarocco' and
'Biondo Commune') and lemon ('Ovale di Sorrento' and 'Zagara'), while
CVd-IV was detected in sweet orange ('Tarocco', 'Biondo Commune', and
'Washington navel'), lemon ('Ovale di Sorrento' and 'Zagara'), clementine
('Commune'), and sour orange. Most trees (82.1 percent) were infected with
more than one viroid species.
The most frequent viroid combinations were CEVd + HSVd + CVd-III (40.2
percent), HSVd + CVd-III (16.1 percent), and CEVd + CBLVd + HSVd + CVd-III
+ CVd-IV (12.5 percent).
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of CEVd, CBLVd, HSVd, CVd-III, and
CVd-IV in the Campania Region and the 1st report of CBLVd and CVd-IV in Italy.

[Scientists T. Ito, H. Ieki and K. Osaki at the Department of Citrus
Research, National Institute of Fruit Tree Science, Kuchinotsu, Nagasaki
859-2501, Japan. <itotaka@affrc.go.jp> developed a multiplex RT-PCR to
detect 6 citrus viroids: Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd), Citrus bent leaf
viroid (CBLVd), Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), Citrus viroid III (CVd-III),
Citrus viroid IV (CVd-IV) and Citrus viroid OS (CVd-OS) and Apple stem
grooving virus (ASGV, synonym: Citrus tatter leaf virus (CTLV)) from citrus
plants. The multiplex RT-PCR was also designed to distinguish CVd-I-LSS (a
distinct variant of CBLVd) from CBLVd. By the multiplex RT-PCR, 1-8
fragments specific to the pathogens were simultaneously amplified from 1
sample and identified by their specific molecular sizes in 6 percent PAGE.
The results of the multiplex RT-PCR were consistent with those of other
diagnoses, such as uniplex RT-PCR, to detect each of the pathogens. The
multiplex RT-PCR provides a simple and rapid method for detecting various
viroids and ASGV in citrus plants, which will help diagnose many citrus
plants at a time. Further information on eradication of citrus viroids is
given in the links below. - Mod.DH]
