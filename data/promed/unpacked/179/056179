GeoSentinel sites and network members are increasingly reporting serious
wound infections in those injured in the tsunami. Aeromonas and pseudomonas
are not unexpected in this situation, but these findings have not yet been
well publicized in all the guidelines put out on tsunami-related disease
risks. All such wounds that appear infected should be treated with
intravenous therapy with more than routine antistreptococcal and
antistaphylococcal therapy while appropriate cultures are pending.
From Pat Charles in Australia
-----------------------------
Have had 2 patients who have returned from Phuket. The 1st had multiple
skin lacerations, 3 of which were very deep. Swabs from 2 of these grew
_Aeromonas hydrophila_. It was resistant to amoxicillin,
amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cephalexin. It was susceptible to ceftriaxone,
the carbapenems, aminoglycosides, and ciprofloxacin. The 3rd deep
laceration cultured _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, which was susceptible to all
standard anti-pseudomonals.
The 2nd patient had extensive superficial areas of skin disruption. Some of
these were cellulitic, and _Aeromonas hydrophila_ was cultured.
Susceptibilities were identical to the above patient. Patient also had some
degree of aspiration pneumonia and was treated with meropenem, then changed
to ciprofloxacin, and is doing well.
From Pam Konecny in Australia
-----------------------------
A 56 year old patient from Sri Lanka was injured in the tsunami while in a
beach hut in Tangalle and was washed 1 km inland to a rice paddy. [The
patient suffered] multiple superficial lacerations and 2 deeper soft tissue
injuries, to the right leg and left iliac crest, [which were] debrided
"locally" and at Colombo hospital. The microbiology and histopathology to
date is as follows:
- probable disseminated mucormycosis arising from the deep leg wound
- multiresistant _E. coli_ sensitive to chloro and meropenem only
- a multiresistant Gram negative rod (GNR), likely _Acinetobacter sp_,
sensitive to meropenem
- a GNR, closest resemblance to _Alcaligenes piechaudii_, sensitive to
ceftazidime, meropenem, pipericillin, timentin
- _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, fully sensitive to antipseudomonas drugs
- MRSA from initial swab in one superfical ulcer, sensitive to vancomycin
- probable _Aeromonas sp._
- _Proteus sp._
- some things on the vibrio plates to be identified
- no _Burkholderia_ yet!
From Elizabeth Teeland, Mondial Assistance, Australia
-----------------------------------------------------
I was in Phuket last week tracking patients for Mondial Assistance. Most
had infected lacerations to lower limbs and aspiration pneumonia. The leg
wounds had been debrided 2 and 3 times in some cases, and the commonest
organisms isolated were _E. coli_, _Aeromonas hydrophila_ and unidentified
Gram negative organisms.
From Prativa Pandey in Kathmandu
--------------------------------
Some of our expatriates from Nepal who were hurt during the tsunami are
undergoing treatment in Bangkok for wound infections. I will keep track of
what infections they have had.
From Francesco Castelli in Brescia Italy
----------------------------------------
A few days ago, we admitted a young woman who returned from the tsunami
area with infected leg wounds. The wounds were due to traumatic injuries
acquired during the tsunami. No specific microorganisms were isolated from
the wounds. She was discharged after broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy.
