Anthrax has been detected in 2 sable antelopes in Edwards County, near Barksdale, Texas. This is the 1st confirmed [anthrax] case in the state this year [2013].

The affected premises has only exotic animals, so no domestic livestock are involved in this case. The Texas Animal Health Commission (TAHC) has issued a quarantine requiring proper disposal of carcasses before the quarantine can be released. Burning destroys the causative agent, preventing soil contamination and reducing the chances of future outbreaks.

"The TAHC will continue to closely monitor the situation for possible new cases across the state. Producers are encouraged to consult their veterinary practitioner or local TAHC office if they suspect they are having an anthrax outbreak or if they have questions about the disease or vaccination of livestock," Dr TR Lansford, TAHC Assistant Executive Director for Animal Health Programs, said.

[This exotic deer ranch is of some 2000 acres (809 ha) downstream from Barksdale. Some 12 sable antelope were found dead but none of the other species -- black buck, kudu, axis, white tails -- appear to have been affected, so far. All the carcasses have been burnt and the other deer vaccinated.

The origin of this outbreak remains obscure though the owners claim that the ranch has not been affected before. As it has been dry up until now the deer have probably been getting bought-in hay, possibly alfalfa. But these exotic deer ranches in West Texas tend to be under new ownership. The old ranchers are dying out and their kids are now metropolitans uninterested in the hard work, and therefore sell off the land in pieces, not infrequently 500 acre (202 ha) lots, attractive to lawyers and doctors wanting a hunting camp. This might seem large to European farmers but in west Texas it is just a back yard, too small to do much with. Most working ranches are 10 000 to 80 000 acres (4000-32 000 ha) -- with some over 100 000 acres (40 500 ha).

Sable antelope live in savanna woodlands and grasslands during the dry season, where they eat mid-length grasses and leaves. Sables will visit salt licks and have been known to chew bones to collect minerals. They are diurnal, but are less active during the heat of the day. Sable antelope form herds of 10 to 30 females and calves led by a single male, called a bull. Sable antelope males will fight among themselves; they drop to their knees and use their horns (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sable_antelope). Their horns would make a very attractive office wall trophy among the competitive male Texans. Thus, their ranching and the fat price asked when you shoot one -- I cannot describe it as "hunting." - Mod.MHJ
