The federal government insists it is on top of Australia's biosecurity after a "very concerning" outbreak of oyster disease became the latest issue to threaten produce.

Pacific oyster mortality syndrome [POMS] was detected in South Australia last week [week of 26 Feb 2018], joining fruit fly in Tasmania as a recent issue to hit the agriculture sector.

Assistant Agriculture Minister Anne Ruston said the government had acted quickly to protect markets.

"Australia has a great reputation for its responses to biosecurity, but it is of a concern and something that should be taken very seriously," Senator Ruston told reporters in Canberra.

POMS causes rapid death and high mortality rates in farmed Pacific oysters and can spread quickly.

Tasmania's AUD 24 million-a-year [about USD 24 million] oyster industry is still recovering after an outbreak of the disease was first detected in early 2016, contributing to low stocks for last year's [2017] pre-Christmas harvest.

POMS was detected last week in Adelaide's Port River, but has not yet been found in any of the state's 8 oyster growing regions.

"It is very concerning and we need to make sure we're doing everything we can to contain it in the area that it is," Senator Ruston said.

Labor's agriculture spokesman Joel Fitzgibbon said oyster disease had joined white spot in prawns, which last year [2017] crippled Queensland's prawn industry, blueberry rust, and fruit fly as recent biosecurity issues.

"This very deeply concerning most recent event surely now calls upon the government to give both our producers, growers, fishers and markets some confidence the government is across these issues," Mr Fitzgibbon told AAP [Australian Associated Press].

He believes exporters will be concerned over recent developments and accused the government of "staying quiet" on the issue.

But Senator Ruston said the government had a proven track record on dealing with breaches.

"What Australia has shown is that while we aren't immune to pest and disease outbreaks, what we have done is put in place extraordinary measures to respond to them," Senator Ruston said.

[Ostreid herpes virus 1 (OsHV-1) was first detected in France in 2008 and was identified as the cause of mass mortality of Pacific oysters (_Crassostrea gigas_). Microvariant genotypes of OsHV-1 have since been detected in association with mass mortality in Pacific oysters in several European countries, in New South Wales (NSW), and Tasmania (Australia). In NSW, mass mortality associated with OsHV-1 Î¼Var in farmed Pacific oysters first occurred in the Georges River in 2010 followed by the Hawkesbury River in 2013 and was termed Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome (POMS). The high mortality rate and seasonal recurrence (in summer months) of POMS has caused significant economic damage to the NSW oyster industry.
