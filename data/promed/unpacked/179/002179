NAME, SHAME & BLAME IN REPORTING

I note the moderator's comments apropos the outbreak of _S.enteritidis_ PT4
associated with lightly cooked shell eggs. Whilst open information is a
laudable aspiration, and one all workers in communicable disease
surveillance and control would aspire to, "name, shame and blame" may not be
the best, and is not the only way to get there.
Name, shame and blame may well cause many contries to withdraw from
collaboration in surveillance activities as they fear the economic
consequences of admitting a problem. It may well be better initially to
involve countries in international collaborations, build their skills and
infrastructure and allow the sharing of data within expert groups. This is
more likely both to acheive the goal of protecting the public health and of
moving towards open information sharing at international level.
It would be interesting to know if the information was shared with the food
safety authorities in other countries which may have been exposed to the
contaminated batch.
The comments also imply that there are some countries where a traveller can
be reassured that it is safe to eat lightly cooked shell egg. I would advise
people not to eat lightly cooked shell egg anywhere -- in which case naming
the country is not relevant to the protection of the individual traveller

[We take to heart the comments of the eminent director of the UK´s Public
Health Laboratory Service. We certainly never meant to imply that it is
safe to eat undercooked shell eggs anywhere. He nevertheless seems to
believe in the value of public health authorities knowing the country of
origin of the contaminated eggs, so why not the public at large?
On the matter of the economic consequences of admitting a problem, we should
have thought it was in any country´s own self-interest to ensure that the
products they export -- or indeed sell domestically -- are safe for human
consumption. The UK has taken enormous pains to keep BSE-infected beef out
of its exports (& home consumption), East Africa is struggling mightily to
ensure that its frozen fish exports are free of pesticide contamination, &
Belgium is no doubt energetically cleaning up its dioxin in meat & eggs
problem (see ProMED-mail archives).
Are Bangladesh, Egypt, Pakistan & Thailand really better off for denying
that they have endemic cholera, rather than upgrading the water supply to
their food processing plants to avoid contaminating the products, for both
export & internal consumption? While WHO does not name the countries of
origin of the imported cholera cases notified to it, the European &
Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO) highlights incidents of
importation of plant pests from countries which have not reported their
presence - Mod.JW]
