Tashkent is tightening border controls and migration in a bid to prevent
the possible spread of plague from neighboring Turkmenistan, according to a
health official. "We recently held a session of the national anti-epidemic
commission, where we adopted a number of measures to prevent the spread of
plague from Turkmenistan to Uzbekistan," Nurmat Atabekov, head of the
sanitary and epidemiological control department, told IRIN from the
capital, Tashkent, on Mon 5 Jul 2004.
His comments followed recent media reports claiming that there had been
reported cases of plague in the northern Turkmen province of Dashoguz,
bordering Uzbekistan. "We got information from mass media reports that the
situation in border regions of Turkmenistan [with regard to plague] is
complicated, but we haven't been able to get official confirmation from
Turkmenistan," Atabekov added.
"Normally in such cases, quarantine and restrictive measures are taken. We
are trying to minimize the migration of the population [in border regions],
preventing [trade in] cattle and livestock products, and strengthening
health control of the people crossing the border," the Uzbek health
official maintained.
According to the Uzbek Health Ministry, some staff members of its
quarantine and contagious infections service and 28 epidemiological teams
were now working in the steppe areas of Khorezm, Navo'i and Surkhandarya
provinces, Karakalpakstan and Ustyurt plateau, bordering Turkmenistan.
Moreover, in Khorezm province and Karakalpakstan, 7 anti-epidemic mobile
teams have been sent, who were taking necessary preventive measures on the
ground.
Also in an effort to avert plague, cattle breeders, geologists, and oil
workers have been vaccinated against plague along with some 15 000 camels
in the region. "We conduct continuous monitoring of the rodent population
for vermin. In these regions, plague bacteria is being detected in both
fleas and rodents," Atabekov said.
According to him, in the former Soviet Union there were 16 areas that were
natural foci for plague and 1 of them was in Central Asia. "The whole
territory of Turkmenistan is an endemic foci of plague. Therefore, they
should not ignore that," he said.
"If there are cases of the infection, they should immediately let us know,"
he noted, adding that the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)
countries earlier agreed on sharing epidemiological information. "We agreed
that we would regularly provide information on the situation with regard to
infectious diseases. In cases of quarantine and extremely dangerous
infectious diseases, we are to inform each other immediately. But
unfortunately Turkmenistan doesn't provide that information."
"We don't know what the overall situation in terms of infectious diseases
and of extremely dangerous infectious diseases, particularly plague, is
[there]," he stressed. "During Soviet times, there wasn't an anti-plague
service in Turkmenistan. An anti-plague station in Astrakhan [Russia] was
carrying out those activities for them. But now, in the post-Soviet era, we
don't know the pace of the anti-plague work there, the scope of it and
whether it is really being carried out."

Turkmenistan says no infectious diseases
----------------------------------------
Authorities said Mon, 5 Jul 2004, that no dangerous diseases have been
detected in Turkmenistan recently, in an apparent response to recent media
reports of a plague outbreak in the country's north.
"The epidemiological situation on Turkmen territory is favorable," the
Extraordinary Anti-Epidemics Commission said in a statement. "No cases of
any dangerous diseases have been reported."
An opposition Turkmen website, Gundogar, reported in Jun 2004, citing
unspecified sources, that Turkmenistan's northern Tashauz province was hit
by a plague outbreak. It did not say how many cases had been reported
there, but said 2 were fatal.
Rumors of the plague in the north have been circulating in the Turkmen
capital, Ashgabat, for weeks and some residents have stopped buying meat
and dairy products that came from outside the city. On Fri, 2 Jul 2004,
fearing the plague may spread to its territory, neighboring Uzbek
authorities announced restrictions on the movement of people and livestock
along the Turkmen border.

[ProMED-mail would appreciate more information regarding whether plague --
in any form -- has been diagnosed in Turkmenistan. According to the WHO
Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response Plague Manual, Kazakhstan
was the only former Soviet republic reporting plague. The first reports
were from 1989. In the 1989-1997 period, 11 cases with 4 deaths were
reported from the Guriev and Kzyl-Orda regions
