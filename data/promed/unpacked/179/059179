Pennsylvania: Contaminated Scallions Identified as Cause of Hepatitis Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------
Contaminated scallions, chopped up raw in salsa that was served free
to every table at a Chi-Chi's restaurant in western Pennsylvania,
almost certainly caused the large outbreak of hepatitis A in the
region, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said yesterday
[Fri 21 Nov 2003].
Food preparation at the restaurant in Monaca, Pennsylvania, amplified
the problem, health experts said. Bunches of scallions, also called
green onions, were stored together in large buckets for 5 days or
more with the ice they had been shipped in from Mexico. As a result,
even if only some bunches were tainted with hepatitis A virus when
they were delivered, it would have quickly spread to all the other
scallions. The ice water in the bucket became, essentially,
"hepatitis soup," said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at
the University of Minnesota who has investigated many hepatitis
outbreaks. When it was time to use the scallions, they were rinsed,
chopped, refrigerated for about 2 more days, and then added to the
salsa, which was made in 40- to 80-quart batches that were kept in
the refrigerator for up to 3 days.
The outbreak, which has killed 3 people and made 575 other Chi-Chi's
patrons ill, is the nation's biggest outbreak of hepatitis A from one
source. The Chi-Chi's restaurant, now closed, is in the Beaver Valley
Mall, about 25 miles northwest of Pittsburgh. The people who became
ill ate there from mid-September to late October 2003. A preliminary
investigation by the Food and Drug Administration indicates that the
scallions came from Mexico.
Genetic tests on viral samples from patients who ate at Chi-Chi's
showed that the virus infecting them is very closely related to one
isolated from victims of hepatitis A outbreaks caused by scallions in
Tennessee and Georgia in September. In those cases, the scallions
were traced to suppliers in Mexico. The F.D.A. said yesterday that
border inspectors were stopping scallion shipments from several
Mexican suppliers.
How the scallions became contaminated is not known. Hepatitis A virus
is spread by fecal matter from infected people, particularly those
who fail to wash their hands after using the restroom. The virus can
survive in food, though it does not multiply outside the body. The
report by the disease control agency noted that children work on the
scallion farms in Mexico, and would be especially likely to spread
the virus. Hepatitis A is a common childhood disease in developing
countries, Dr. Osterholm said. Children are far more likely to be
infected than are adults because most adults in the developing world
had the disease in childhood and became immune to it.
Sewage-contaminated water could also have been the culprit, whether
it was used to irrigate the scallions or wash them in the field, or
to make the ice used in shipping. Rinsing at the restaurant did not
remove the virus, possibly because fecal or viral particles stuck to
the scallions or were trapped inside them. Scallions cannot be
disinfected because it would take so much chlorine that they would
become inedible, Dr. Osterholm said. The government has been advising
consumers to avoid eating raw scallions, but they are safe if
thoroughly cooked.

[This press report does not add any new information to the more
detailed MMWR report posted on ProMED-mail as "Hepatitis A,
restaurant related - USA (PA) (06) 20031121.2893". The evidence
regarding the origin of the hepatitis A virus responsible for the
outbreak in Pennsylvania remains to some extent circumstantial. It
would be interesting to know the extent of the "sequence similarity"
observed between the hepatitis A viruses isolated from affected
individuals in the Pennsylvania outbreak and the earlier outbreaks in
Tennessee and Georgia in September, in comparison with hepatitis A
viruses currently circulating in Mexico. - Mod.CP]
