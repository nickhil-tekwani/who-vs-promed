An outbreak of bird flu has led to a "commerce war" threatening El
Salvador's poultry industry, as more Central American countries prevent
Salvadoran birds from passing their borders for fear of the deadly virus.
Honduras closed its borders to Salvadoran poultry on 7 Apr 2001, when it
detected bird flu in chickens close to the border. The ban had a
devastating impact on El Salvador's $20 million annual business with
Honduras -- 80 percent of its egg market.
More countries stopped buying Salvadoran chickens and eggs, because the
products had to first cross Honduran borders to reach other Central
American nations. On Monday, El Salvador blocked the entry of Honduran
dairy products, arguing they were illegally mixed with powdered milk.
"These are 2 totally different problems," said Arturo Flores, spokesman for
the El Salvador Agriculture Ministry. The 2 countries plan to meet Saturday
to negotiate a solution.
A team of technicians will inspect Salvadoran farms to determine whether
the illness is present.
Bird flu is a virus normally found only in poultry, but recently began
spreading to humans. In 1997, dozens of people in China got sick, and 4
died. Thousands of chickens also died before the country slaughtered 1.2
million more to prevent the disease's spread.
So far, no chickens have died in El Salvador or Honduras, officials said.
Although El Salvador's Ministry of Agriculture has stressed there's no
proof the flu is even present, President Francisco Flores admitted Thursday
the virus may thrive throughout Central America and Mexico.
