Student Health Services reports that, as of 1400 Thu 14 Dec 2006, 62
undergraduate students have fallen ill with a gastrointestinal illness. The
symptoms are a sudden onset of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea that passes
in 6 to 12 hours. More than 80 per cent of the students have been treated
at the on-campus Student Health Services; the remainder have been sent for
outpatient treatment to local hospitals. DC Department of Health officials
have been on campus Wednesday and Thursday. This afternoon the DC
Department of Health notified Student Health Services that preliminary lab
tests of students who have fallen ill show the presence of norovirus.
Norovirus infection is a self-limiting illness, meaning that it resolves
over time on its own. Most of the students who have been sickened since
Tuesday have recovered. However, the virus is easily transmitted from
person to person. Members of the university community are advised to engage
in very frequent hand washing and good hygiene. To read more about
norovirus, see <http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/revb/gastro/norovirus.htm>.
Norovirus has an incubation of 24 to 48 hours; therefore it is advisable
for members of the community to exercise good hygiene in order to prevent
the spread of the virus.

[This health advisory notice is being relayed in the context of reports of
norovirus infection in Europe, Japan, and in California. Many CUA students
will soon be traveling to their home states and there is a risk of spread
of the outbreak to the wider community. - Mod.CP]
