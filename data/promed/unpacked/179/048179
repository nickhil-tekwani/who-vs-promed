Influenza activity continues to rise slowly in the WHO European Region due to A(H3N2)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary

Influenza activity continues to rise slowly in the WHO European Region due to A(H3N2)
• This issue is based on data for week 3/2012 reported by 46 Member States in the WHO European Region. Consultation rates for influenza-like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infection (ARI) continue to be relatively low in most countries of the Region, but with many countries reporting increasing activity.
• 29 % of sentinel specimens tested positive for influenza, which is an increase over last week: 95% of these were influenza A.
• Of the 352 influenza A viruses from sentinel sources that were subtyped, 99 % were A(H3N2).

Current situation: week 3/2012

Trends in clinical activity were reported by 42 countries: 20 stable, 19 increasing and 3 decreasing. At the same time, ILI and ARI consultation rates remained at low levels in most countries of the WHO European Region. Similar to the previous week, consultation rates were highest in young children. Of the 41 countries reporting on the geographical spread of influenza: 12 reported no activity; 7 local activity; 18 sporadic activity; and 4 countries (Finland, Iceland, Italy and Spain) regional activity. Intensity was reported to be low in most countries reporting on this indicator, except for Bulgaria, Iceland, Italy and Spain, where influenza activity was at medium levels.

Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI): week 3/2012

11 countries reported data from sentinel hospital-based surveillance for SARI: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, the Russian Federation, Serbia and Ukraine. The number of SARI hospitalizations remained largely unchanged compared to the previous week, except in Kazakhstan, which reported increases in SARI hospitalization – mainly in children aged 0–4 years. A total of 122 respiratory specimens was collected from SARI patients, of which 10 (8%) tested positive for influenza with 6 being subtyped, all as A(H3N2). 6 countries so far (Albania, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Romania and Ukraine) have reported influenza detections in SARI patients during the course of this influenza season.

Virological situation: week 3/2012

Sentinel outpatient clinics collected 1469 respiratory specimens, 422 (29 %) of which tested positive for influenza viruses: 401 (95%) were type A and 21 (5%) were type B. Of the 352 influenza A viruses subtyped, 349 (99%) were influenza A(H3N2) and 3 (1%) were A(H1N1)pdm09. In the 18 countries testing 20 or more sentinel specimens, influenza positivity ranged from 0% to 85%, with a median of 22% (mean: 25%). In addition, 525 non-sentinel specimens were reported positive for influenza: 504 (96%) type A and 21 (4%) type B. Of the influenza A viruses, 189 were subtyped: 173 (92%) as A(H3N2) and 16 (8%) as A(H1N1)pdm09.

Cumulative virological data: weeks 40/2011 – 3/2012

During this period, 3436 influenza virus detections were reported: 3226 (94%) were influenza A and 210 (6%) were influenza B. Of the influenza A viruses, 2099 were subtyped: 1985 (95%) as A(H3N2) and 114 (5%) as A(H1N1)pdm09.

In addition, 56 influenza viruses were characterized antigenically: 46 were A(H3) A/Perth/16/2009 (H3N2)-like; 2 were A(H1N1)pdm09 A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)-like; 2 were B/Florida/4/2006-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); 2 were B/Bangladesh/3333/2007-like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage); and 4 were B/Brisbane/60/2008-like (B/Victoria/2/87 lineage). Of 95 influenza viruses characterized genetically, 1 belonged to the A(H1N1)pdm09 group represented by A/Astrakhan/1/2011; 1 belonged to the A(H1N1)pdm09 group represented by A/St Petersburg/100/2011; 5 belonged to the B/Bangladesh/3333/2007 clade (Yamagata lineage); 2 belonged to the B/Brisbane/60/2008 clade (Victoria lineage); and 86 belonged to the A/Victoria/208/2009 A(H3) clade – 63 in the group represented by A/Stockholm/18/2011 (group 3), 19 in the group represented by A/Iowa/19/2010 (group 6) and 1 in the group represented by A/Johannesburg/114/2011(group 7).

Comment

Influenza activity has increased consistently over the past several weeks, but influenza detections remain low compared to the same period of the 2010/2011 season. Influenza A and B viruses are co-circulating in the Region, with the vast majority of detections in both outpatient clinics and hospitals being A(H3N2).

[These data are consistent with the impression that the onset of the annual seasonal influenza season is delayed. Currently the predominant virus isolated throughout Europe is an A/(H3N2) virus and not the previously predominant A/H1N1)pdm virus. - Mod.CP]
