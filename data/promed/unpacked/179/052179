The MSPP (Ministere de la Sante Publique et de la Population) has
reported 171 304 cholera cases and 3651 deaths nationwide, as of 1 Jan 2011.

The North-East Department remains severely affected, where as many as
100 new cases a day have been reported by the MSPP. The response has
been hampered by logistical difficulties and a lack of beds.

In the South Department, a total of 2733 cases and 142 deaths have
been reported. In the South-East, a total of 1226 cases and 161
deaths were notified in the reporting period. Nippes is currently
under-served by health partners; 955 cases and 97 deaths have been
reported in that department by the MSPP.

According to current MSPP data, the epidemic is stabilizing in some
parts of the country, mainly in Artibonite, but it is rising in
others, particularly in the south.

Exact epidemiological data is not available for Port-au-Prince and
the surrounding West Department.

[3] Diarrhea - Colombia (Bolivar)

There is a possible outbreak of cholera [although the term cholera is
used here, ProMED has no information to confirm this as the cause of
the flooding-associated diarrhea - Mod.LL] among the victims who are
in temporary shelters in the Bolivar department, which has worried
the authorities. The threat looms over all those affected in the
municipalities of Soplaviento, St. Kitts, and St. Stanislaus Kostka,
north of Bolivar, who are today living in schools and other shelters
after the waters of the Canal del Dique flooded their homes.

To counter the epidemic, the health authority launched a departmental
contingency plan that involves taking water samples and inspecting
the food that the population is consuming. "For now, we are
monitoring the situation by visiting the affected areas and warning
people about the risk they run if they do not consume safe food,"
said Larry Lazarus, an official of the Government of Bolivar.

[5] Cholera - Zimbabwe

A cholera outbreak has been detected in one of Harare's oldest
suburbs, Majubheki in Mbare, with at least 20 households having
reportedly been affected. This has raised concern over the spread of
the infamous epidemic that claimed over 4000 lives and affected
thousands more countrywide in 2008.

Chairman of the Harare Residents Trust in Majubeki Samuel Mapurisa
said affected residents were taken to Matapi (Mbare) Poly Clinic
after suffering from severe stomachaches, diarrhea and vomiting.

The Epidemiology and Disease Control director in the Ministry of
Health, Dr Portia Mananganzira, could neither confirm nor deny the
Harare outbreak but said the probability of such an outbreak was high.

"I cannot confirm the outbreak, but I would not be surprised, because
cholera cases have recently been reported in Manicaland and
Mashonaland West provinces. Going into 2011, 69 cases of cholera had
been reported in Mashonaland West," she said.

[6] Cholera - Papua New Guinea (East Sepik)

<http://www.thenational.com.pg/?q=node/15390>


The cholera outbreak in East Sepik has spread to Ambunti district's
Iniok village and neighboring villages from the Tunap sub-district.
At least 10 people have been confirmed dead since 31 Dec 2011, with
unconfirmed reports of more casualties.

Ambunti-Dreikikir district administrator Solomon Hopkos confirmed
this last Friday [31 Dec 2010] after being alerted by community
affairs officers of Xstrata Copper company, which is developing the
Frieda River copper-gold project in the district. Its helicopter flew
health officials and necessary medical drugs from the Burui health
centre to the affected communities.

District health officer Dominica Wain, who is currently in the
affected villages to assess the situation, said: "As of 29-30 Dec
2010, more people are being affected, and the death toll is increasing."

Since cholera is waterborne, contaminated waste in the river will
prove fatal, because there are many villages along the banks of the
Sepik River, and it could spread to villages downstream.

A Staff member at the Port Moresby General Hospital's cholera
treatment centre (CTC) reportedly became ill after coming into
contact with a patient's feces and vomit on Wednesday [29 Dec 2010].
This happened as people with cholera-like symptoms from the city and
parts of Central continued to go in numbers to the CTC for treatment
since last Friday [24 Dec 2010].

The 12-bed centre has been full since the start of the long weekend,
with patients experiencing severe diarrhea. Staff had to work around
the clock to treat those patients and attend to new admissions. As of
yesterday morning [30 Dec 2010], 9 people were admitted, bringing the
number of admissions to 273 for December 2010.
