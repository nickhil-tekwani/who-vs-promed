Avian Influenza Found in New York Live Bird Market; Japan and Taiwan Halt Poultry Exports from New York
--------------------
USDA's National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) has confirmed H5N1 (presumably low pathogenic) from a live bird market in New York. According to USDA's agreement with Taiwan, FSIS has been notified to amend the FSIS Export Library to state that the export of poultry meat and meat products from the State of New York to Taiwan is prohibited effective immediately.

This is also the situation for Japan. Japan's avian influenza bans cover product produced from birds from farms in the banned state, as well as from birds slaughtered/eggs laid in the state; product processed in the state; and product that was stored in or transited the state, except after final packaging for FSIS meat products and after official sealing for table shell eggs.

Japan has agreed to exempt product from poultry slaughtered (or eggs laid) and shipped out of (or packaged with final packaging for FSIS meat products or officially sealed for table shell eggs) New York prior to 12 Dec 2012. Combined with previous "ineligible dates" from other bans, this means that the following dates are now ineligible for Japan (from New York):

- Products produced prior to 22 Feb 2008;
- Product produced on or after 11 Apr 2008, but before 15 Jan 2009;
- Product produced on or after 11 Feb 2009 but before 25 Dec 2009;
- Product produced on or after 20 Dec 2011 but before 31 Aug 2012; and
- Product produced on or after 12 Dec 2012.

[It has become expected that Japan, Taiwan and often times Russian markets will ban poultry/poultry products, including eggs from markets identified as having low pathogenic strains of avian influenza.

Avian influenza (AI), commonly known as "bird flu," is caused by a virus that can infect domesticated and wild birds, including chickens, turkeys, pheasants, quail, ducks, geese, and guinea fowl. AI virus strains are classified into 2 groups by pathogenicity, or the ability of the virus to produce disease, in domestic chickens. Highly pathogenic (HPAI) virus strains are extremely infectious, often fatal to domestic poultry, and can spread rapidly from flock-to-flock. Low pathogenic (LPAI) virus strains occur naturally in wild birds without causing illness, but some are capable of mutating into HPAI viruses. It is believed to be this capacity to mutate that causes other countries to ban the poultry products.
