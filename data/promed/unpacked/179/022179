MYSTERIOUS DISEASE RAVAGES INDIANA MELON INDUSTRY
--------------------------------------------------
Farmers in southwestern Indiana are tilling watermelon fields and leaving
the crushed melons to rot in the sun instead of waiting to gather final
truckloads for traditional Labor Day markets.
A sporadic soilborne disease, unique to the region for several years, has
returned this summer and ruined at least a third of the lucrative crop. The
so-called "sudden wilt" baffles scientists, threatens the state's melon
industry and has farmers calling for government help. Melons have been a
part of southwestern Indiana agriculture for generations. Seedless and
nonseedless varieties alike thrive on the sandy, well-drained soils.

[The disease in watermelon is similar to vine decline in other cucurbits.
Vine decline is a world-wide disease (parts of the USA, Central America,
Mexico, Israel, and Spain) of cucurbits, and is particularly prevalent in
arid cropping areas. A number of fungi (_Fusarium oxysporum_ f. sp.
_niveum_, _Acremonium cucurbitacearum_, _Monosporascus cannonballus_, and
_Pythium aphnidermatum_), and at least one phloem-limited, walled bacterium
belonging to the gamma-3-proteobacteria, have been associated with the
disease. The disease in Indiana, often called "sudden wilt" but now more
properly named "vine decline" was first observed in 1989. Disease intensity
was high in 1998 and 1999, but in other years the disease is of much less
significance. The use of transplants, plastic mulch and irrigation
exacerbate disease induction. Race-specific resistance is available for the
disease induced by _F. oxysporum_ f. sp. _niveum_. -Mod.DH
