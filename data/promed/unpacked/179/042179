The Ministry of Health of Guatemala confirmed the existence of 5 cases of
leptospirosis, a disease transmitted by rats, in the municipality of Los
Amates (Department of Izabal), the Director of Epidemiology of the Ministry
of Health, Mario Gudiel, informed this news agency Friday.
"The Ministry had known (of the cases) and ordered treatment of 5 persons
affected by the disease, put none of these [cases are in danger of death",
signaled the official at a press conference.
Gudiel negated that the reported cases were related to the appearance of
plagues of rats in various municipalities of the Departments of Peten, Alta
Verapaz and el Quiche, all to the north of the capital.
[Over the past few weeks and again the past several days there have been
periodic reports in the Central American press about 'plagues of rats';
countries reporting this occurrence have included Guatemala, Honduras and
Nicaragua. Belize, Costa Rica and Nicaragua have reported cases of
leptospirosis this year. See ProMED-mail postings above - MPP.
The first case of invasion of rats was observed in el Peten, last June and
the week before other denouncements surged in diverse communities of Quiche
and Alta Verapaz.
The Vice Minister of Agriculture for el Peten, Luis Larrazabal, assured
that the adult population of rats was eliminated in some 70 communities of
this department, and that the teams were displaced to work in two other
steps planned for the elimination of the breeding sites.
