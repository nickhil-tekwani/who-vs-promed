The Department of Health [DOH] has confirmed that dengue in the region is
rising with 858 recorded cases compared with the 647 cases within the same
period last year [2008].

DOH-CAR [Cordillera Administrative Region] medical officer III and
anti-dengue program coordinator, Dr Alexei Marrero, reported that dengue
cases in Kalinga, Ifugao, Benguet, Apayao, and Abra have significantly
increased compared with last year [2008]. On a brighter note, cases in
Baguio decreased to 194 compared with the 261 cases recorded last year
[2008] while Mt Province has 62 recorded cases down from the 72 cases last
year. There were also 34 non-CAR dengue cases that were admitted in
hospitals in the region, Marrero said.

Marrero also confirmed that there 6 dengue related deaths have occurred
this year [2009], compared with the 4 deaths last year. On community
outbreaks, DOH recorded an outbreak in Lagawe, Ifugao last week and in
Tabuk, Kalinga 2 weeks ago.

According to Marrero, the DOH has already intensified its campaign against
dengue in terms of advocacy and Information, Education and Communication
(IEC) campaign. The office is also providing logistics and technical
assistance to different hospitals in the region.

The DOH is also currently implementing dengue-free schools initiatives by
providing mosquito insecticide treated curtains to selected areas
throughout the region. Clinical Dengue Management Trainings are also
provided to different hospitals and Rural Health Units (RHUs) and Dengue
Vector Surveillance -- orientation for teachers.

Dr Marrero also reminded the public of the health department's 4S campaign
against dengue -- Search and destroy of mosquito breeding grounds, Self
protection, Seek early consultation, and Say no to indiscriminate fogging.

Meanwhile, with the onset of the rainy season and as dengue cases are again
on the rise, president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has ordered the DOH to
intensify the campaign against dengue through its public health educational
programs.

In a statement, deputy spokesperson Anthony Golez stated that the president
asked local government units and national health officials to cooperate in
combating the scourge, which has claimed a number of lives in depressed
communities.

"The important thing is the cooperation of all. With the LGUs [local
government units] and their health officials, with the national health
officials, support of the DOH, particularly our hospitals, is needed by
families or patients with dengue today. They need to work together to
prevent or reduce cases of dengue," Golez quoted the president as saying.

Dengue fever claims 7 lives in Haripur
--------------------------------------
Dozens of new dengue fever cases have been reported in various parts of
Haripur [district, North-West Frontier Province] after 7 people died from
the virus, a private TV channel reported on Sunday [27 Sep 2009]. According
to the channel, at least 7 patients diagnosed with dengue fever died last
week [week of 20 Sep 2009] in Khanpur, Pind Gujran, Khoi Nara, Raniwah, and
other parts of Haripur. Dozens of new dengue patients have also been
admitted to hospital, the channel added.

Talking to the channel, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Member National
Assembly Sardar Muhammed Mushtaque urged the health department to send
doctors to the area to help deal with the situation. At least 25 deaths and
as many as 1800 dengue fever cases have been confirmed in the country. This
is posing a serious problem for the country and is putting further strain
on an already inadequate health infrastructure.

Patients with dengue fever in city hospitals are on the rise as this
mosquitoborne disease takes a turn for the worse with the advent of
monsoon, medical experts said. Doctors at different hospitals and clinics
said that on average 10-15 patients are coming to hospitals with dengue
fever every day. A medical officer of Shishu Hospital said, "If the
condition of patients is serious we advise them to get admitted into the
hospital, otherwise we discourage any admission as it is a mosquitoborne
disease and might infect other child patients." [This implies that the
hospitals are infested with _Aedes aegypti_ dengue virus mosquito vectors.
- Mod.TY] Only 11 patients were admitted to the hospital till Thursday
night [24 Sep 2009], said the doctor on duty.

Dr Saroj, senior medical officer of Shomorita Hospital, told The Daily Star
yesterday [25 Sep 2009] that at least 20 dengue patients had been treated
at the hospital in the last 2 weeks. On average 8-10 patients come to visit
doctors every day, he added. "8 dengue patients are now undergoing
treatment at the Central Hospital on Green Road and we have had patients
over the past one month," said assistant director of the hospital Dr Fahim
Ahmed. 14 dengue patients were treated at Holy Family Red Crescent Hospital
till Thursday evening [24 Sep 2009], said information officer of the
hospital HM Ashim.

The influx of patients with symptoms of dengue is more at the private
hospitals and clinics in the city than the public ones. A large number of
dengue patients have been admitted to private hospitals and clinics,
sources at the medical service centres said.

Sources at the Shaheed Suhrawardy Hospital said as the number of swine flu
patients dropped the authorities are now using the swine flu corner for
treating dengue patients.

The government's Dengue Control Room failed to provide the number of
affected people but unofficial sources said it is already much higher than
last year [2008].

City dwellers of different areas, including Goran, Basabo, Dhanmondi,
Khilgaon, Shantibag, Rajarbagh, Mirpur, and Gandaria said the mosquito
eradication programme of the Dhaka City Corporation (DCC) was not visible.
"I did not see any activities of DCC to control mosquitoes this season
though the area is dirty and water-logging is very common," said Sheikh
Sahidul, a resident of Shantibag. DCC mayor Sadeque Hossain Khoka told The
Daily Star, "Fogging is going on in residential areas and we are spraying
larvicide on water bodies after removal of garbage." A meeting with
lawmakers of Dhaka and DCC officials concerned would be held soon to work
out a plan to create mass awareness among people as the situation is
worsening, he said.

According to the dengue study group of the Department of Disease Control of
the Health Directorate, the mosquitoborne disease dengue has emerged as a
public health problem in Bangladesh since its 1st outbreak in 2000.

Dr M Mushtuq Husain, senior scientific officer of the Institute of
Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), a government institute
that monitors prevalence of diseases, said the number of dengue patients
had increased in the hospitals because of monsoon and it is the opposite in
case of swine flu. People with sudden onset of high fever but with no
respiratory problem or common cold symptoms can also be suspects of dengue
syndrome, experts said.

The _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito bites in the early morning and evening. This
mosquito breeds in a small collection of clean water in residential houses,
especially domestic containers, according to the epidemiologists. According
to the World Health Organization's guidelines, people should avoid mosquito
bites, use long-sleeved shirts and protective clothing, sleep under
preferably insecticide-treated mosquito nets, and destroy all in-house and
adjoining breeding sources of _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes (containers,
coconut shells, cans, used tyres, earthen pots, flower vases, etc.)

Jalisco [state] is the leader in dengue [virus] infections. In one week 340
cases were reported, the greatest number in the entire country, or an
average of 2 people infected each hour.

Jalisco has lived its worst week related to dengue, so far this year
[2009]. With 340 official reports [of dengue cases], 240 of classical
dengue fever and 51 of DHF, it was the state with the greatest number of
reports in the country in epidemiological week 36 of 2009 (6-12 Sep 2009),
leaving behind the states of Veracruz, Colima, Guerrero, Michoacan, and
Tabasco, which are the leaders in total [annual] cases and which are still
above [Jalisco] in the national rankings. Moreover, in reaching 1408 ill
people [with dengue], it failed the challenge of the state Secretariat of
Health, which was to reduce [the number of dengue cases] by at least 10 per
cent of the total for 2008, which was 1441 cases.

The 340 cases also were the greatest number recorded in the state in one
week so far in 2009. And finally, to obscure the picture, the average of
confirmed infections reached 48.5 per day during this period (an average of
2 every hour), the worst record in the year [2000] and which resulted in
Jalisco rising one spot (to 6th place) among the states with more dengue in
the country.

These figures emerge from the latest report from the National Center of
Epidemiological Surveillance and Disease Control (CENAVECE) of the federal
Health Secretariat (SSA) and were released only 18 days after the state
governor Emilio Gonzalez said the dengue cases were declining in the state
and 13 days after an official of the Jalisco Health Secretariat (SSJ),
Alfonso Gutierrez, said that in 2 weeks the outbreak of the epidemic in
Guadalajara, where the greatest number of this contagious [transmissible]
disease transmitted by the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_ is occurring, would
have been controlled.

The goal of the SSJ to "have 10 per cent fewer cases than last year (that
is 1300 compared to 1441 in 2008) announced 4 months ago (Publico, 23 May
2009) by Fermina Espinoza Riestra, chief of Vectors and Zoonoses, has been
left far behind.

The epidemic outbreak in Jalisco represents a 293 per cent increase in the
dengue cases registered in the state last year [2008] for the same dates,
when there were 358 [dengue virus] infections, only one of which evolved to
DHF.

It is worth noting that these figures from the latest report from the
National Center of Epidemiological Surveillance (CENAVECE) may include
patients whose date of onset was recorded up to 2 weeks before, so it is
possible to expect that an upward trend of infections prevails since the
outbreak of dengue remains active, as evidenced both in the federal agency
that reports having 1378 additional cases under study (289 suspected of
classical dengue fever and 1089 [suspected cases of] DHF), and in the
influx of hundreds of patients to hospitals in the metropolitan area of
Guadalajara. Added to this are the projections of specialists from the
University Committee on Emerging and Reemerging Diseases at the University
of Guadalajara, who believe that the outbreak will remain active at least
until November 2009 (Publico, 11 Sep 2009).

Questioned yesterday [22 Sep 2009] about all this, the Jalisco secretary of
health, Alfonso Gutierrez Carranza, simply responded that "dengue now does
not have seasons", and contrary to its behavior in previous years, when it
was assumed that the winter season concluded the transmission cycle of this
[virus] infection (as had been announced by his chief, Emilio Gonzales, 3
weeks ago), now [transmission] "year round" can be expected, but assured
that in the organization "we are here working ... we are not going to lower
our guard."

The advance of dengue has put the health authorities on alert in Dourados.
According to the numbers announced on Friday [18 Sep 2009] by the
Epidemiological Surveillance Nucleus of the municipal Secretariat of
Health, from January [1st] to present, 964 suspected dengue cases have been
recorded in the municipality. Of this total, there are 705 confirmed cases
and 26 pending cases. These numbers are even more alarming when compared
with the total of dengue cases recorded last year [2008] in Dourados. The
number of recorded cases as of last week is 312 per cent above the total of
suspected cases diagnosed as dengue last year [2008] when, for the whole
year, there were just 232 cases. Now among the positive [dengue] cases in
the municipality it is 2100 per cent this year [2009] compared to the
numbers in 2008, when there were just 32 cases, a quantity far less than
the 705 confirmed cases up to now in Dourados.

According to Roberto Oliveira of the Epidemiological Surveillance Nucleus,
Dourados is currently facing a dengue outbreak. The increase in the number
of cases noted by specialists is the result of the introduction of [dengue]
virus type 2 into the municipality. In previous years, the [dengue] virus
circulating in Dourados was type 3, which made a large proportion of the
population protected against the disease [caused by that dengue virus
serotype. - Mod.TY]

"Dourados is living through a dengue outbreak because the great majority of
these cases are concentrated in neighborhoods such as Jardim Ouro Verde,
Portal de Dourados, and Vila Industrial. The situation is worrisome now
that the number of cases is far above that expected for the area for this
time of year. It is important to recall that the greatest incidence of
dengue cases in previous years was in summer, which begins in December," he
commented.

In an attempt to halt the progression of dengue, about 15 days ago the city
began using a new larvicide to combat the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which
is the agent that transmits dengue [virus]. The biolarvicide diflubenzuron
is designated as the new weapon in the fight against dengue in Mato Grosso
do Sul. The product promises to be more effective than those used previously.

[It would be of interest to learn how effective the new larvicide is in
reducing _Aedes aegypti_ populations. Presumably, the abundance of this
dengue virus vector is being monitored.

Ceara recorded, between Friday of last week [11 Sep 2009] up to last [Fri
18 Sep 2009], 31 new cases of dengue. The news bulletin released by the
state Secretariat of Health shows that this year [2009], 4462 cases in 108
of the 184 Ceara municipalities have been confirmed.

Regarding the numbers of dengue hemorrhagic fever cases and those with
complications, the bulletin did not indicate any changes. There were 20
confirmed DHF cases and 5 deaths from the disease. Until now 18 cases of
dengue fever with complications have been recorded, with 11 deaths.

<promed-port@promedmail.org>

[Ceara has about 8.2 million inhabitants, this gives us a focus, a little
over 54 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. Considering that the outbreaks are
relatively localized, we must have areas with very high incidence. The
mortality rate is 0.20 per 100 000, but the lethality, considering 38
serious cases, reaches 42 per cent -- absurdly high. Of course there may be
a serious bias in the classification of cases. - Mod.LJS
