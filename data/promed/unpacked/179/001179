Identification of bovine popular stomatitis virus infection in buffalo calves in North India
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Between 18 to 20 Aug 2015, 4 buffalo calves of 1 month of age were reported ill with symptoms of circular and flat skin erosions on ear pinna [auricle], along with papules on muzzles, lips, and forehead from Government Livestock Farm 2 (GLF-2) of Hisar district of Haryana state in India. Within 10 days of the 1st observation, a total of 11 buffalo calves were affected out of 55 calves in a herd. 2 calves which were severely affected running with high fever, were off feed and had erosion/small vesicles on the dental pad, gums, and tongue, and eventually died within 3 days. Clinical signs indicated pox virus infection.

Biopsy samples and autopsy samples were collected and processed for histopathological examination and molecular diagnosis. DNA was extracted from these samples and conventional PCR was performed using orthopoxvirus and pan-parapox virus specific primer pairs. The pan-parapoxvirus primer pair PPP-1 and PPP-4 (Inoshima et al, 2001), amplified a corrected sized and specific band of 594 bp, corresponding to a partial sequence of B2L gene, which confirmed it to be a parapoxvirus infection. The PCR amplicons were sequenced and phylogenetic tree was constructed, which confirmed the presence of bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) in the samples. The B2L gene sequence from these samples of BSPV showed nucleotide identity of 84 per cent with the orf virus (ORFV) and 83 per cent with pseudocowpox virus (PCPV).

These analyses confirmed that it was a bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) infection in the herd of buffalo calves.

Bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) is a mostly-benign, wide-spread disease of cattle, caused by an epitheliotropic double-stranded DNA poxvirus of the genus _Parapoxvirus_ (PPV), which also includes the closely related contagious ecthyma of sheep and goats (orf, scabby mouth) and other diseases. It may, at times, be confused with early signs of vesicular diseases in cattle such as FMD and vesicular stomatitis.

Orf infections in humans can include the finger, hand, arm, and face, following contact with infected sheep or goats. Other body parts may occasionally be affected as well (such as, penis by infection from the hand during urination). The same guidelines to animal keepers/caretakers, in relation to orf, are applicable in relation to BPSV: good personal hygiene should be observed and gloves used when treating infected calves.

Pictures of BPSV lesions in calves and on human hands are available at http://tinyurl.com/pz4gw9y.

We are very grateful to Dr Maan and his colleagues for bringing this 1st-hand, science-based information to our subscribers' attention. It would be interesting to note if BPSV has been observed in buffalos elsewhere. - Mod.AS]
