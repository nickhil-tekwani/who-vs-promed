Germany's national disease control center says a further 94 people
have been sickened by the deadliest _E. coli_ outbreak in modern
history. The Robert Koch Institute [RKI] said the number of registered
infections in Germany rose to 2325 Tue 7 Jun 2011, with those in other
European countries still standing at about 100.

The institute adds the latest figures indicate that the number of new
cases is declining, a sign that the epidemic might have reached its
peak. But it cautions that it is not certain whether the latest
decrease will continue in the coming days.

It said the number of people suffering from a serious complication
that may lead to kidney failure among those sickened rose by 12 to
642.

At least 21 people have already died from the _E. coli_ [O104]
outbreak in Germany, where some 2200 infections have been registered,
mainly centered in and around Hamburg. But other cases have spread
throughout the nation and beyond, with another death and even more
cases reported in other European countries, including Sweden, Denmark,
the Netherlands, and elsewhere. Most of those infected are believed to
have visited Hamburg or other parts of northern Germany.

Over the weekend [4-5 Jun 2011], fresh sprouts became the latest
suspected culprit. On Sun 5 Jun 2011, Gert Lindemann, agriculture
minister for the western state of Lower Saxony, said officials were
conducting lab tests on samples from a farm in the Uelzen district
near Hamburg. Indications were apparently so strong that sprouts were
the cause of the outbreak that the state's Consumer Protection and
Food Safety Ministry recommended consumers avoid eating them. By the
next afternoon [6 Jun 2011], however, the ministry revealed that 23 of
40 samples taken from various locations on the sprout farm had tested
negative for the bacteria. The remaining 17 samples must still be
examined, the ministry said. Later that day, ministry officials said
suspicions remained that the sprouts may have caused the outbreak.

Evidence does, however, indicate the outbreak is somehow linked to
Hamburg's large wholesale produce market, the same place where the
contaminated Spanish cucumbers were found, though officials remain
uncertain whether the contamination occurred on the farm or during
shipping, storage, or packaging. "In recent days we've had long
conference calls with other agencies and have determined that clues
repeatedly point to Hamburg's wholesale market," an unnamed Bremen
health ministry official told 'Spiegel'. "It seems to play some kind
of role or another."

Vendors at the huge market hall, which is as large as 30 football
fields, have suffered immensely from a general fear of raw produce
arising from the RKI's daily renewal of its recommendation for
consumers to avoid tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce. Meanwhile, the
initial warning about Spanish cucumbers has sparked diplomatic
tensions with Spain, which is now demanding compensation for lost
sales. Though many of the some 150 fruit and vegetable wholesalers at
the Hamburg market have voluntarily handed over their produce for
testing, all of it coming back _E. coli_-free, some report they are
still unable to sell up to half of their products. Thousands of
cartons go to waste each day, shipped off for compost or biogas
plants. With the produce destroyed, it may be too late to ever
discover the bacteria's origin, experts warn.

"As the 1st people took ill, the contaminated batch had probably long
since been sold," said Lothar Wieler, director of the Institute of
Microbiology and Epizootics at Berlin's Free University. As the 1st
HUS [hemolytic uremic syndrome] cases emerged, the vegetables would
have already been eaten or thrown out, ultimately leaving the source a
mystery. But therein lies the fatal mistake of the German health
authorities. 18 valuable days were lost between when the 1st patient
came down with diarrhea around 1 May 2011, and when the RKI was
finally alerted.

While part of this may be because those infected waited until their
cases became severe [enough] to see a doctor, the delay also [may]
indicate that German doctors were not properly prepared to report and
handle the outbreak. Many failed to consider the possibility of an _E.
coli_ infection at all, sending patients with diarrhea home with a
prescription and failing to take stool samples. But the larger problem
is that local German health authorities are given abundant time to
relay news of _E. coli_ infections in their area. Infections, evidence
of _E. coli_ sources, and even resulting deaths must be reported to
state authorities just once a week, at the latest on the 3rd working
day of the week following initial identification. State authorities
then have another entire week before they must inform the RKI. "Why
can't this just be directly sent electronically?" asked Wieler of the
Institute of Microbiology and Epizootics in Berlin.

In the meantime, investigators are focusing on cucumbers, tomatoes,
lettuce and, most recently, sprouts. They have monitored every
domestic producer, following their channels of distribution, but
without success. With so much time gone by, hope of finding the source
appears to be running out.

[Enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC), in my experience, is rarely
thought about by primary clinicians. It is likely that, if the
outbreak had occurred in the USA, there would have been some delay in
recognizing the outbreak as well. This might be compounded by the fact
that most labs do not specifically test for EHEC unless asked to do so
and are likely to use sorbitol-MacConkey agar, which does not pick up
non-O157 strains. These strains require testing for the Shiga toxin
directly.

As previously discussed in this thread, and as stated above, it is
certainly likely that the contaminated vehicle (whether sprouts or
not) is no longer available for testing. - Mod.LL]

A GTA (Greater Toronto Area) man who traveled to Germany has Canada's
1st suspected case of _E. coli_ [O104] connected to outbreaks in
Europe, Ontario's chief medical officer of health has confirmed.

In a news release Mon 6 Jun 2011, Dr Arlene King said the man, who
lives in Peel Region, had recently traveled to Germany where he had
eaten local food including vegetables. Preliminary tests showed the
presence of the same toxin linked to _E. coli_ overseas.

Lab results confirming the findings are expected in a few days. The
man, who has not been identified, was released from hospital last week
[week of 1 Jun 2011].

"The risk to Ontarians from this outbreak is very low," King said,
adding that local health units have been advised to report any cases
of _E. coli_ from recent travelers to Germany.

A case of the _E. coli_ (EHEC) bacterial infection has been diagnosed
in Helsinki, the Finnish National Institute for Health and Welfare
said Fri 3 Jun 2011.

The properties of the _E. coli_ bacterium found in the patient are
similar to those exhibited by the deadly bacteria in Germany. The
patient has been in Germany recently and is now recovering, the
institute said.
