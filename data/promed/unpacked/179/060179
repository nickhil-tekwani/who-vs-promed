The Health Department in American Samoa says it has confirmed the acute rash outbreak as cases of chikungunya, [infection by] a virus similar to dengue fever [clinically and epidemiologically, but in a different virus family - Mod.TY].

The 3 samples sent off island for testing have been confirmed as the virus, which are the 1st confirmed cases of chikungunya [virus infection] in American Samoa.

The virus is transmitted to people by mosquitoes, with the most common symptoms being fever and joint pain, and other symptoms including headache, muscle pain, joint swelling, or rash.

The Department of Health's acting medical director, Dr Fuimaono, says they are glad to now know the exact type of illness they are dealing with. "We've been encouraging and we've been informing our community, that this is symptomatic where we treat it with Tylenol and lots of fluid. The bottom line is prevention; so far we have about 100-plus cases; we're happy now that we know what sort of guide that we're going to [with that] confirmation of the chikungunya."

Dr. Fuimaono says they are still awaiting the results of 20 other specimens sent off island, but dengue has been ruled out for most of them.

[There is no indication in the above report from where and how chikungunya virus arrived in American Samoa and initiated the outbreak. There have been chikungunya virus outbreaks in the Pacific Islands recently this year (2014; see citations below), and it is tempting to speculate that the virus came from one of these islands. Once in American Samoa, spread of the virus is not surprising because it has had dengue virus transmission in the past, and the same mosquitoes that transmit dengue can transmit chikungunya virus as well.
