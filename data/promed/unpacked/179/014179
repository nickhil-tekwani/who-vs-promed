Veterinarians have issued a warning about a serious bacteria outbreak that could kill your dog.

The [bacterial disease] is called "leptospirosis" or "lepto" for short. [The bacterium] infects dogs by burrowing into their skin, then, it spreads throughout the dog's body.

More cases of the bacterial infection are being found in Chicago, especially in the Lake View area.

Leptospirosis is spread through [contact with the urine of infected rodents] and if left unfound, can be deadly for dogs.

"While we're all super excited about 70 deg F [21 deg C] weather, it is sort of the perfect storm for leptospirosis exposure," said Dr Natalie Marks of Blum Animal Hospital.

Doctor Marks says there's been an uptick of dogs being tested for and contracting leptospirosis.

"We are unfortunately, the rattiest city in the US. We were just given that title. So we have a very high population of rodents. We've had unseasonably warm and rainy weather," Dr Marks said. She says that's the perfect breeding ground for leptospirosis. It's sprouting up all over the country and now in Chicago.

"Some dogs can be carriers of lepto where all we see is an increase in thirst and urination or we can see a full blown very severe infection, where dogs come in with a fever, they may have yellowing to their skin, they're vomiting, and having diarrhea," Dr Marks said. It can also cause liver or kidney failure.

"I'm a little worried," said the owner of a 10-month-old puppy. "My greatest concern would be if there's a way of cleaning up the dog park areas to make sure they're clean and taken care of, so we can keep this from being a breeding ground."

Dr Marks says there are concerns for dogs who live in close quarters in urban areas. "Dogs that live off of alleyways, dogs that go to the dog park, or the dog beach and are drinking water out of Lake Michigan; dogs that go to the dog run where there is communal dog water bowls or drink out of store front water bowls, are definitely more at risk," Dr Marks said.

There is a vaccine available for dogs. Vets ask pet owners to make sure they ask for one that covers all 4 strains found in Chicago.

Leptospirosis can also spread to humans. In New York City, 3 cases were identified and 1 person died from the infection.

[In doing some searches this article appears quite similar to some articles from September 2016 and from 2014. If there is evidence of exposure we would appreciate hearing from some veterinarians.

Leptospirosis is a disease caused by infection with _Leptospira_ bacteria. These bacteria can be found worldwide in soil and water. There are many strains of _Leptospira_ bacteria that can cause disease. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, which means it can be spread from animals to people. Infection in people can cause flu-like symptoms and can cause liver or kidney disease. In the United States, most cases of human leptospirosis result from recreational activities involving water. Infection resulting from contact with an infected pet is much less common, but it is possible.

Lepto generally enters through mucus membranes, not generally through intact skin, but it is possible.

Dog parks and other areas where dogs congregate are an area of concern. Those managing the dog parks could and perhaps should post signs that communal water dishes will be removed and owners are responsible for bringing their own dish. A water source should be provided, but this can be used by the owners to fill their own bowl for their pet.

Vaccinations against the disease are available and owners should be encouraged to have their pet vaccinated.

Owners whose pets are diagnosed with the disease should be cautious about cleaning urine or putting their hands in the animal's mouth. Gloves work well for these activities. It is also suggested you follow your veterinarian's suggestion for treatment for your pet as well as safety for yourself.
