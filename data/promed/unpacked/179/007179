The Department of Ag, Sea and Fisheries (PKP) Maros Regency announces
a level one alert for anthrax, which has infected a local's cow.

This level one alert from the PKP dept. follows the sudden death of a
cow in Tinggito township, Tenriangkae village, Mandai sub-district,
Maros on Mon 5 Apr 2010 at 22.00 Central Indonesian Time.

The death of [this] cow brings the total of cows suddenly dying to 3.
The 1st was found last week and tested positive for anthrax after
laboratory tests.

"Now we (PKP dept.) are on level one alert. We must be careful not to
have any more dead cows," said the Head of the PKP in Maros, Sri
Alam, on Tue 6 Apr 2010. [The owner] had already lost 2 cows
suddenly, which later tested positive for anthrax. One of them had
not been vaccinated. Sri Alam stated that the cow that died last
Monday was not yet confirmed with anthrax or not. "This cow, we are
not yet certain whether it died of anthrax or not," She said.

In the meantime, the field officers of the Section for Prevention of
Transmissible Disease in Maros, Isdarjid said that with the finding
of the 2nd case in the same location, field officers would be
particularly vigilant in their examinations. "We are undertaking
disinfectant spraying twice a day in the [owner's] cow sheds," he
reported. Several of the pens were being isolated and no other
animals permitted to enter this area. The PKP dept. immediately
buried the cow carcass to prevent spread of the anthrax bacteria. The
regulations stipulated that the carcass be buried 2 meters deep and
covered in lime. Before burial, the carcass was burned and sprayed
with disinfectant.

On Mon 5 Apr 2010, another cow was found dead of suspected anthrax in
Tinggito village. Of 20 people tested, 3 results have come through so
far and all found to be negative.

[Our thanks to Sharon for finding this report and Jonathan for his
fast translation.

This report seems to be ongoing events in the same village in the
last posting, in which 5 people were infected, and 3 died.
Fortunately, there were no human cases associated with this 2nd dead
bovine with anthrax. There are various questions raised by this
report -- confirmation procedures, vaccine efficacy, why the cowshed
was disinfected and with what chemical -- but we are constrained by
the quality and quantity of facts in the original report by
Tribun-Timur. - Mod.MHJ]
