After confirmation of the deaths of 2 monkeys from yellow fever in
the region of San Jose do Rio Preto, the state of Sao Paulo issued a
new alert for the disease. According to the State Health Department,
with this confirmation, all people who live or visit the Grande and
Parana River region must be vaccinated [against yellow fever virus].

Vaccination begins next Mon 7 Apr 2008, but only people who are not
immunized or who received a dose of the vaccine more than 10 years
ago need to be vaccinated.
