CDC is collaborating with public health officials in multiple states
across the USA and with the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety
and Inspection Service (USDA/FSIS) to investigate an ongoing
multi-state outbreak of _Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- (pronounced 'four
five twelve eye minus') infections in humans. An investigation that
used interviews comparing foods eaten by ill and well persons is
showing that eating Banquet brand pot pies produced by the ConAgra
Foods company is the likely source of the illness.

Between 1 Jan 2007 and 15 Oct 2007, at least 181 isolates of
_Salmonella_ I 4,[5],12:i:- with an indistinguishable genetic
fingerprint have been collected from ill persons in 33 states. Ill
persons whose _Salmonella_ strain has this genetic fingerprint have
been reported from Arizona (1 person), Arkansas (3), California (6),
Colorado (2), Connecticut (3), Delaware (5), Georgia (2), Idaho (7),
Illinois (5), Indiana (3), Kansas (2), Kentucky (8), Massachusetts
(6), Maryland (5), Maine (1), Michigan (3), Minnesota (6), Missouri
(13), Montana (4), Nevada (6), New York (8), Ohio (8), Oklahoma (1),
Oregon (3), Pennsylvania (14), Tennessee (5), Texas (4), Utah (2),
Virginia (6), Vermont (2), Washington (13), Wisconsin (21), Wyoming
(3). Their ages range from less than 1 to 87 years with a median age
of 20 years; 52 percent of ill persons are female. At least 33 people
have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.

Advice to consumers
-------------------
ConAgra Foods has issued a voluntary recall of frozen pot pies that
may be linked to this outbreak. The following brands of frozen pot
pie products are subject to this recall:
Banquet
Albertson's (sold at Albertson's)
Food Lion (sold at Food Lion)
Great Value (sold at Wal-Mart)
Hill Country Fare (sold at HEB)
Kirkwood (sold at Aldi)
Kroger (sold at Kroger)
Meijer (sold at Meijer)
Western Family (now discontinued; previously sold at a variety of
small retailers)

These frozen pot pies include all varieties in 7 oz (about 200 gm)
single serving packages bearing an establishment number "P-9" or
"Est. 1059" printed on the side of the package. These frozen pot pie
products were distributed to retail establishments throughout the
USA, Puerto Rico, and the Caribbean islands. These products could
still be in consumers' freezers, so it is important that consumers
look for and return or discard these products. Consumers should not
eat these products.
