A rabid kitten came into contact with 15 people from 4 Manalapan families, who are all currently undergoing rabies treatments [presumably post-exposure prophylaxis], Manalapan Township Health Director David Richardson said on Tuesday [26 Nov 2013]. The kitten came from a cat colony at a work site in [the town of] Perth Amboy. An employee of the work site brought the kitten, and its sibling, to his home in Manalapan. The man brought the kitten to a local veterinary hospital because it began to act fatigued and it eventually progressed to paralysis. The vet euthanized the kitten and prepared it for rabies testing, according to Richardson.

The 2nd kitten is currently in a restricted 6-month quarantine in a Freehold [township] home where it has limited human interaction. The kitten shows no signs of illness currently, Richardson said. The Perth Amboy Animal Control and Middlesex County public health authorities are examining the area where the kittens were found. They are not aware of other human exposures to rabies at this point. Richardson said that this situation is a time to remind residents to be cautious of wild animals, including stray cats and kittens. "Rabies is still present and circulating in wild animals, notably raccoons and bats," Richardson said in the press release. This kitten in particular did not have any wounds and was adopted because the feline looked thin. "Though well intentioned, this situation has evolved into a dangerous, potentially life threatening situation, costing tens of thousands of dollars to properly manage and prevent human rabies disease," Richardson said.

In the United States transmission of rabies from cats or kittens to humans has been very rare. People are usually infected following a deep bite or scratch by an infected animal. The comatose condition of the kitten suggests that the risk of transmission of rabies virus from the kitten to its human handlers was low. However transmission can also occur when infectious material -- usually saliva -- comes into direct contact with human mucosa or fresh skin wounds.

Little information has been provided about the origin of the kitten and how it came to be infected, particularly since a kitten from the same litter remains healthy. Further information would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
