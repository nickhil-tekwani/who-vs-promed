Kazakh Ministry of Agriculture: Chinese fruits contain heptachlor
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Kazakh Ministry of Agriculture ordered inspectors to tighten control
over import of Chinese fruits due to detection of heptachlor in the
products, reported Megapolis.

The ministry ordered state inspectors to tighten phytosanitary
quarantine control over Chinese products, to take action in order to
secure the Kazakh market from such products.

The reason for such measures is detection of heptachlor, a health
damaging pesticide, in fruits such as lemons, mandarins, nuts, and
oranges imported from China. This pesticide is used in agriculture
for insect pest control and can cause serious damage to human health.

Heptachlor is a manufactured chemical and doesn't occur naturally.
Heptachlor was used extensively in the past for killing insects in
homes, buildings, and on food crops. These uses stopped in 1988.
Currently it can only be used for fire ant control in underground
power transformers. Products with heptachlor should be destroyed.

Maral Rakhimzhanova, expert of Sanitary and Epidemiological
Inspection of Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan, said: "Last year
[2008], when heptachlor was detected in Chinese fruits, they were
sent to Health Inspection Services, which confirmed the fact. All
regions were required to check all production coming from China.
Chief sanitary officer sent a letter to all regions with request to
forbid import of Chinese fruits, and 25 tons of Chinese fruits were
sent back to China."

[Heptachlor is an insecticide similar to chlordane. However there is
no reliable information on human exposure. In animals there is
evidence of liver damage, hyperexcitability, and fertility decreases.
Lifetime exposures and very high levels have shown liver failure in
animals, but similar evidence does not exist in humans. - Mod.TG]
