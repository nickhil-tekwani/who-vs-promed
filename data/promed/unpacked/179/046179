The investigation of an outbreak of unknown origin in Angola has
revealed extremely high levels of bromide in plasma sampled from
several affected patients.

As of 19 Nov 2007, over 390 cases had been identified and treated at
the Municipal Hospital in Cacuaco. About 64 percent of those affected
are children under 15 years old.

Toxicological tests carried out in Munich, Germany detected very high
levels of bromide in 5 out of 6 plasma samples taken from affected
patients. Bromide intoxication has been one of the working hypotheses
being explored by WHO and partners as a cause of the outbreak.

The laboratory results provide an important focus for testing on
human, environmental and food samples to confirm these bromide
levels. Additional samples are currently on the way to a laboratory
in the UK for testing for bromides.

On Wed 21 Nov 2007, WHO deployed further technical and operational
support to assist Angolan health authorities, including a field
coordinator, a clinician, 2 epidemiologists, a food safety expert, a
laboratory specialist, and a logistician. This team will support
further epidemiological studies, case management, social mobilization
and risk communication, environmental investigations and laboratory
testing to confirm the cause of the outbreak and to support response
and control measures.

[Bromide can mimic the physiological path of chloride in the body. A
hypochloremic state may develop because of this similarity. The
chloride is displaced and excreted by the kidneys. Hence, the
treatment is to load the body with chloride, often in the form of
salt, which forces the body to excrete the bromide.

Multiple clinical signs possibly related to the neurological system
may occur. These have included slurred speech, ataxia, headaches, and
possible signs mistaken for epilepsy. Reflexes may be altered, either
increased or decreased. (Horowitz, 1997; Fried and Malek-Ahmadi,
1975; Wacks, Oster, et al., 1990; Carney, 1973). Almost always, the
patient appears slow, sluggish or sleepy.

It will be interesting to see what the labs conclude from the samples
as well as the epidemiology of these cases. - Mod.TG]
