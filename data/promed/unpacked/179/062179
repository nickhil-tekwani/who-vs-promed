Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) was first reported by Chinese researchers in 2011 as the world's 1st tick-borne febrile infection caused by the SFTS virus (1). In Japan in 2013 in Yamaguchi Prefecture the 1st SFTS patient to develop was reported (2). In recent years, there have been reports of cases of suspected direct infection from pet animals such as dogs and cats (3). The epidemic in Japan is confined to western Japan west of Shizuoka prefecture, and cases are reported every year, but SFTS cases in the Kanto region as an estimated infection area have not been reported so far. This time, we conducted a retrospective survey of so-called unknown fever patients who were suspected of having tick-borne rickettsia infection but could not be diagnosed and reported that the first case of SFTS virus infection was confirmed in Chiba prefecture.

We performed an anti-SFTS virus antibody screening test using paired sera for 242 patients with fever of unknown origin (for the past 12 years) by the ELISA method using SFTS virus HB29-infected HuH-7 cell-lysing antigen. Since an increase in antibody titer was confirmed in one of these cases, a gene detection test was performed using real-time RT-PCR targeting the SFTS virus NP gene. As a result, a 6.27 x 10^2 copy / mL SFTS virus gene was performed from the acute phase serum was detected. The SFTS virus NP gene was also detected by conventional RT-PCR targeting the SFTS virus NP gene. From the phylogenetic tree analysis, the SFTS virus detected was J1 type, which is a Japanese type (Fig.[available at the source URL above]). In addition, in the indirect immunofluorescence method using SFTS virus-infected Vero cells as an antigen, the anti-SFTS virus antibody was negative in the acute phase serum, but the convalescent phase serum was 640 times more positive. Based on the above, this case was retrospectively diagnosed as a SFTS patient.

This patient was a male in his 70s and visited a nearby doctor in 2017 with complaints of fever and rash. The patient's place of residence is the area where Japanese spotted fever is endemic in the Minami-Boso area of Chiba prefecture. The inspection was carried out. In the indirect immunofluorescence method using acute phase serum and convalescent serum, the antibody titer against _Rickettsia (R.) japonica_, which is the causative agent of Japanese spotted fever, is 20 times or less, and the antibody titer increases from the acute phase to the convalescent phase. Was not recognized. In addition, DNA was extracted from the scab from a tick [bite] and PCR was performed, but the gene of _R. japonica_ was not detected. Based on the above, this case was reported to the local health center as negative for Japanese spotted fever.

Chiba Prefecture is one of the few epidemics of Japanese spotted fever and scrub typhus in the Kanto region, and patients are reported every year, but SFTS patients have not been reported so far. This time, a retrospective survey of patients suspected of having rickettsia but who could not be diagnosed revealed that these were SFTS cases, which was the 1st report of a patient infected with the SFTS virus in the Kanto region. This suggests that SFTS patients are potentially present in areas where tick bites are common and rickettsiae such as Japanese spotted fever has been reported. In addition, the importance of differential diagnosis of rickettsiae and SFTS has been reported in the past in SFTS endemic areas (4). Based on these facts, even in areas where SFTS patients have not been reported at this time, if these rickettsial diseases are suspected, it is desirable to also perform SFTS testing as a differential diagnosis while paying attention to clinical differences (5). On the other hand, it has been reported that the SFTS virus has a natural infection cycle, and when an animal having an antibody prevalence above a certain level exists, the risk of SFTS virus infection in that area increases (6). Therefore, we believe that it is an urgent issue to evaluate the risk of the area including humans through the survey of wild animals, and in Chiba Prefecture, we started collecting blood samples from wild animals such as deer, wild boar, araiguma [raccoon], and kyon [Reeves' muntjac or barking deer]. The risk of developing tick-borne infections will be assessed from a serum epidemiological study. In SFTS endemic areas, it is important to educate not only agricultural and forestry workers who are often bitten by ticks, but also hunters and veterinarians who often come into contact with animals to prevent SFTS virus infection.

[The report above provides an interesting historical overview of SFTS in Japan. It also presents a strong case for including SFTS in differential diagnoses when cases of _R. japonica_ infections are suspected. The report indicates that SFTS virus has become established in Japan. There were cases every year from 2013 to present. Cases were widely disbursed geographically in 2018, with 24 prefectures reporting infected individuals. There were 96 cases in the 1st 11 months of 2019. Since there is no vaccine, the best way to avoid infection is to avoid tick bites and contact with infected pets, especially cats.

SFTS is a serious disease and of significant public health concern. Although SFTS virus infections may be serious, there is evidence for subclinical or mild infections as well, so the previous numbers may be an underestimate of the total number of infections. There is also some evidence for person-to-person direct transmission of the virus, but that appears to be a rare event. The virus is doubtless endemic in several countries in Asia, and cases have occurred previously in Japan. Apparently, there are 2 previously reported affected individuals who acquired their infections directly from an SFTS virus-infected cat. No mention was made of tick transmission in that instance. The possible route of transmission from the cat to the veterinarian and veterinary nurse via exposure to blood or other bodily fluids is not mentioned (see Severe fever w/ thrombocytopenia synd. - East Asia (02): Japan (MZ) 20181211.6204927).

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. Images of a longhorn tick, _Haemaphysalis longicornis_, the SFTS vector, can be seen at http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/pests/paralysis-tick/haemaphysalis-longicornis-description.htm. - Mod.TY
