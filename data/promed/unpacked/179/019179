Bluetongue upsurge in the Mediterranean basin
---------------------------------------------
In ProMED's posting of 6 November, the moderator remarked about the need to
explain the spread of bluetongue virus(BTV) in the region. In response, I
have put together some notes and comments.
The upsurge of BT has been observed, since 1999, in 2 distinct extension
areas within the Mediterranean basin. One is an eastern epizootic,
reportedly associated with BTV serotype 9, which initially affected Turkey,
mainland Greece, and Bulgaria. The other is a western epizootic, which
arose in December 1999 and January 2000 in Tunisia, close to the Algerian
border, reportedly associated with BTV serotype 2. These were the first
recordings of bluetongue in mainland Greece, Bulgaria and North Africa.
During 1999, outbreaks were reported also in the Greek islands close to the
Turkish coast, namely Lesbos and the Dodecanese islands [Rhodes, Kos and
Leros. - Mod.AS. These outbreaks were found to be associated with BTV
serotype 4 and, possibly, with serotype 16 and other serotypes. Lesbos was
also affected by BT in 1979 [BTV serotype 4.- Mod.AS and the Dodecanese
islands in 1998.
The eastern epizootic reportedly continued, during 2000, in Turkey. In 2001
it extended to north western Greece, close to the Albanian border and the
Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia. Later, it further spread north
west, to Kosovo and Serbia in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, where
outbreaks have been confirmed as far north as latitude 45 degrees 30
minutes N. Of the countries at risk in the region, only Albania and
Montenegro have not reported bluetongue. The outbreaks in 2001 were again
associated with BTV serotype 9, suggesting perhaps that the virus had
overwintered in the region. Vector studies conducted in Greece during the
BT outbreak in 1999 failed to identify midges of the species _Culicoides
imicola_, but detected large numbers of _C. obsoletus_ and other species,
which are regarded as less efficient vectors of bluetongue.
On the western front, outbreaks of BTV serotype 2 infection started again
in June 2000, affecting the Tunisian coastal districts until October. In
July and August the disease was recorded, for the first time, in the
contiguous coastal areas of neighboring Algeria. From there it seems to
have been carried by infected vectors to Europe. During 2000, outbreaks of
bluetongue were reported in Italy: in August on the island of Sardinia and
in November on the island of Sicily and in Calabria -- the first time on
Italy's mainland. In October it was recorded on the island of Corsica
(France) and in October and November on Spain's Balearic Islands, last
infected in 1960. Mainland France and Spain remained free.
In July 2001, clinical cases of bluetongue reappeared in Corsica, and in
August and September in Sardinia and Calabria, suggesting that the virus
might have overwintered in France and Italy. Bluetongue was also detected,
in 2000 and 2001, to be present near the border between Lazio and Tuscany,
north of Rome on the west side of Italy at the same latitude as Corsica,
extending southwards below Rome. No new outbreaks have been reported,
during the 10 first months of 2001, in Spain's Balearic Islands nor in
North Africa.
Virus characterisation studies in Corsica indicated that the 2001 outbreaks
have been associated with the same BTV serotype 2 responsible for outbreaks
in 2000. Entomological surveillance identified large populations of
_Culicoides imicola_ in affected areas in France and Italy.
In March 2001, BTV serotype 9 was identified in the south of Italy, east of
the area where serotype 2 had been reported in 2000 and remained active in
2001. [Italy is thus currently affected by 2 BTV serotypes; consequently,
it decided to use a bivalent vaccine, as approved by the EU. - Mod.AS.
One possible reason for the changing pattern of bluetongue disease in the
Mediterranean region is global warming, which would be expected to extend
northwards the geographic range of vectors from warmer climates. Associated
with this is also the possibility that global warming will not only affect
the geographic range of vectors but also increase the permissiveness of
unconventional vectors to BTV multiplication when reared at elevated
temperatures, as suggested by Wittman and colleagues (1998)in their paper
on _Culicoides Nebulosus_ [4th International Congress of Dipterology, 6-13
Sept, Keble College, Oxford, UK. Abstracts volume, pp. 248-9. This topic
needs to be investigated thoroughly, in view of the serious potential
implications for livestock production in Europe if the trend continues.
Other factors could also be involved and these obviously need to be
identified and described.

[Dr Roeder's summary and comments on the rapid spread of BT into most
European countries along the Mediterranean are indeed timely. Until
recently, BTV activity was restricted to the areas south of latitude 40
degrees; its reported confirmation, in Yugoslavia, as far north as 45
degrees is alarming and should be of great concern. Since similar
developments might not be excluded in the western hemisphere as well as in
southern latitudes, enhanced surveillance is essential. Additional factors,
such as seasonality, altitudes, the role of attenuated vaccine strains, the
genetic susceptibility in various sheep breeds and the possible involvement
of _Culicoides_ species other than _C. imicola_ are to be considered
carefully. Bovines are the sentinels of choice for seroconversion. The
traditional stamping-out policy, as recently applied in newly-infected
areas, deserves reassessment. - Mod.AS
