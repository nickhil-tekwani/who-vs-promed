The basidiobolomycosis warning for Arizona prompted a question on a bat
discussion group in which I participate.
E. L. Cockrum (University of Arizona) is revising his book:
Rabies, Lyme Disease, Hanta Virus and Other Animal-Borne Human Diseases in
the United States (1997, Fisher Books, Tucson, ISBN 1-55561-138-9).
As part of this he has been trying to track down the link mentioned between
basidiobolomycosis and bats. He noted that [he found on the web the CDC
MMWR (Morbidity and Mortality Report) for August 20, 1999/ 48(32);710-713,
the basis of the newspaper >article. This report includes that the fungus
"has been isolated throughout the world from decaying vegetation and soil
and from the GI tracts of reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insectivorous
bats." A source citation is given. However the article cited DOES NOT
mention any bats (nor the amphibians, reptiles and fish).
Subsequently one reference was posted to batline. It was
Chaturvedi VP, Randhawa HS, Khan ZU, Singh N, and Kini S
Prevalence of Basidiobolus ranarum Eidam in the intestinal tract
of an insectivorous bat, Rhinopoma hardwickei hardwickei Gray,
in Delhi. Sabouraudia 1984;22(3):185-9
This reference notes "A more extensive sampling of bat species including
their guano is indicated to elucidate the role of Chiroptera in the
biological cycle of _B. ranarum_."
Is anyone aware of additional cases in which this fungus has been found in
bat intestinal tracts or guano?
