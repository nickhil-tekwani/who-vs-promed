Deer at Fort Carson (Colorado) had wasting disease
-------------------------------------------
A mule deer buck killed last month [December 2004] by a hunter at
Fort Carson has tested positive for chronic wasting disease (CWD),
the state Division of Wildlife has confirmed.
Fort Carson is the farthest south that wildlife officials have found
the disease along the Front Range.
Kathi Green, Colorado wildlife division disease coordinator, said the
adult mule deer buck was the 2nd one to be tested for chronic wasting
disease in El Paso County.
A hunter who shot the deer last month [December 2004] submitted a
sample to the wildlife division for testing. The Veterinary
Diagnostics Laboratory at Colorado State University confirmed Friday
[28 Jan 2005] that the animal had the disease.
A Colorado Springs resident reported a sick deer to the wildlife
division last April [2004]. That animal also tested positive for the
disease, officials said.
