Newcastle disease outbreak eradicated by veterinarians in the Novgorod region
------------------------------------------------------
Veterinarians have controlled an outbreak of Newcastle disease [NCD] in
wild birds in the Chudovskom area of the Novgorod region. This information
was released by the regional veterinary directorate to Novosti's
correspondent on 8 Dec 2004.
The 1st mortalities of wild birds in the city of Chudovo and in the
suburban settlement Korpovo were recorded by veterinarians in October 2004.
City pigeons were the species predominantly affected. Laboratory analyses
have established that the cause of death was NCD, a list A disease of
avians, which is absolutely harmless to humans and domestic (non-poultry)
livestock.
In the Chudovskom area, the veterinary authorities immediately applied
preventive measures, including free-of-charge revaccination of domestic
poultry in private and cooperative farms. According to information from the
veterinary directorate, 100 per cent of the domestic birds received an
(intranasal) vaccination.
Wild birds that could become disease carriers (vectors) have been shot or
caught in the vicinity of poultry farms. "No new cases of NCD in wild birds
have been yet observed, during December, in Chudovo or Korpovo", said the
director of the Regional Veterinary Directorate. According to data from the
directorate's management, similar outbreaks had not been recorded in the
Novgorod region for at least 12 years. [The Novgorod region is located in
the northwestern part of Russia, south and adjacent to the Leningrad
region. The area's surface is 55 300 square kilometers, the human
population about 1 million.]

[The only wild bird species mentioned are pigeons; further details would be
helpful. Outbreaks of Newcastle disease in pigeons, caused by pigeon
paramyxovirus-1 subtype (PPMV-1), were reported during 2003/2004 from
several European countries, including Austria, Belgium, Norway, and Sweden.
Not all pigeon variant viruses (PPMV-1) show virulence for chickens, but
some have caused serious outbreaks. A laboratory confirmation -- or
otherwise -- of the outbreak reported from the Novgorod region is
anticipated. According to the Office International des Epizooties' manual
of standards, Newcastle disease is defined as an infection of birds caused
by a virus of avian paramyxovirus serotype 1 (APMV-1) that meets one of the
following criteria for virulence:
a) the virus has an intracerebral pathogenicity index (ICPI) in day-old
chicks (_Gallus gallus_) of 0.7 or greater.
or
b) multiple basic amino acids have been demonstrated in the virus (either
directly or by deduction) at the C-terminus of the F2 protein and
phenylalanine at residue 117, which is the N-terminus of the F1 protein.

According to OIE's epidemiological statistics, 11 NCD outbreaks have been
reported from Russia during the first 9 months of 2004, in the following
regions (oblasts): Altayskiy kray, Bryansk, Nizhegorodsk, Moskva (city),
Smolensk and Ivanovsk. It will be important to determine whether pigeons
were among the affected birds. - Mod.AS]
