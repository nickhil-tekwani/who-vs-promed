Avian botulism has killed up to 7 000 birds and continues to spread in wildlife refuges south of Klamath Falls [Oregon].

Dry and hot conditions have contributed to the rapid spread of the disease, according to the Herald and News.

Refuge workers have been removing dead birds to limit the infections of live birds.

Ducks have been most affected because they've concentrated at Tule Lake in California while Lower Klamath Lake [California] remains dry.

The waterfowl cannot fly for about a month while they're molting. That leaves them no way to leave the diseased marsh.

Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with
warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Outbreaks of
botulism in wild aquatic birds are a natural phenomenon in North America. - Mod.PMB]]
