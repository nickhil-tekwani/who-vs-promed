During the 1st 4 months of 2011, there were 10 cases of Lyme disease
in Donetsk, Ukraine and more than 300 cases of people bitten by ticks.
Unfortunately, people come to health facilities late when they are
symptomatic, not right after a tick bite.

Every year, there are more and more cases of Lyme disease. In 2010,
there were 190 cases, which is 10.5 percent more than in 2009. The
greatest numbers of cases were registered in Artemovsk, Slavyansk,
Kramatorsk, Donetsk, Gorlovka, and Makeyevka. The main cause of growth
in the number of Lyme disease cases is an increase in the number of
ticks and their expanding habitat. The number of people bitten in 2010
was 4057, which is 20 percent more than in 2009.

[In 2011, Gorlovka city was the most affected by Lyme disease. In
Donetsk, there were 10 cases. Most of the people affected are
residents of urban areas visiting the countryside during the weekend
and getting bitten as a result of neglecting preventive measures. -

"Lyme borreliosis has been reported in all administrative regions of
Ukraine with an "increasing tendency." The hard tick _Ixodes ricinus_
has been found to be the main vector of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ there.

Abstract [in 2008 post]:
-----------------------
Cases of human Lyme borreliosis (LB) are registered in all
administrative regions of Ukraine and in the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea with an increasing tendency. The hard tick _Ixodes ricinus_ was
proven to be the main vector of _Borrelia burgdorferi_ s.l., the
causative agents of LB. We identified active natural LB foci in which
almost 25 percent of the adult _I. ricinus_ ticks contained borrelias,
and more than 30 percent of the human population were seropositive for
Lyme borreliae.

The role of _Mus musculus_, _Microtus arvalis_, _Myodes glareolus_,
_Apodemus agrarius_, and _A. sylvaticus_ in the transmission cycle of
the LB agent(s) was revealed. Combined foci and cases of LB/TBE
(tick-borne encephalitis) mixed infection were registered in 8
oblasts. A considerable spectrum of different clinical manifestations
of LB has been found, including erythema migrans [red patches on the
skin that move around] in 64.9 percent of cases, neurologic symptoms
in 26.1 percent, rheumatic affliction in 24.7 percent, and
cardiovascular problems in 8.3 percent."

The Donetsk region is located in southeastern Ukraine with an area
that is 4.4 percent of the entire territory of Ukraine and a
population of about 4.6 million people (2006)
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_Oblast). The Donetsk region's
climate is mostly continental, which is characterized by hot summers
and relatively cold winters. Its largest towns include Donetsk city,
Artyomovsk, Slavyansk, Kramatorsk, Gorlovka, and Makeyevka. The
regional center is Donetsk city.
