--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
While several clinical and immunological parameters correlate with disease severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 infection, work remains in identifying unifying correlates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that can be used to guide clinical practice. Here, we examine saliva and nasopharyngeal (NP) viral load over time and correlate them with patient demographics, and cellular and immune profiling. We found that saliva viral load was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 risk factors; that it correlated with increasing levels of disease severity and showed a superior ability over nasopharyngeal viral load as a predictor of mortality over time (AUC=0.90). A comprehensive analysis of immune factors and cell subsets revealed strong predictors of high and low saliva viral load, which were associated with increased disease severity or better overall outcomes, respectively. Saliva viral load was positively associated with many known COVID-19 inflammatory markers such as IL-6, IL-18, IL-10, and CXCL10, as well as type 1 immune response cytokines. Higher saliva viral loads strongly correlated with the progressive depletion of platelets, lymphocytes, and effector T cell subsets including circulating follicular CD4 T cells (cTfh). Anti-spike (S) and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG levels were negatively correlated with saliva viral load showing a strong temporal association that could help distinguish severity and mortality in COVID-19. Finally, patients with fatal COVID-19 exhibited higher viral loads, which correlated with the depletion of cTfh cells, and lower production of anti-RBD and anti-S IgG levels. Together these results demonstrated that viral load - as measured by saliva but not nasopharyngeal -- is a dynamic unifying correlate of disease presentation, severity, and mortality over time.

"CXCL10, a chemokine that attracts activated T cells expressing CXCR3, was identified as the most important positive correlate of higher saliva viral load.

The association of older age, heart failure, cancer, and certain forms of immunosuppression with higher viral loads suggests a possible interplay between these factors (1-4,27) Our study evaluating saliva not only confirms the association of higher viral load with these and other known COVID-19 risk factors including hypertension, and chronic lung disease, but demonstrates that these factors have an additive effect in overall viral load levels, which may contribute to the increased risk of severity in individuals with multiple risk factors (4) . Our study also found that saliva viral load was significantly higher in males, a known risk factor in COVID19, associated with a distinct immune response than what is seen in females (3,41-43). Therefore COVID-19 risk factors may be reflective of a baseline capacity of the host to support viral replication, predisposing those with multiple risk factors to higher viral loads and worse outcomes. The high early viral replication in a given host is likely a reflection of failed innate immune responses including interferon-mediated antiviral defense. Indeed, impaired innate antiviral defense is seen with the COVID-19 risk factors including advanced age (44), metabolic syndrome (45), cancer (46), and immunocompromised status. In addition, recent work has also shown increased expression of ACE2 in the lungs of individuals with COVID-19 risk factors (47), which may further predispose those with pre-existing conditions to higher viral replication."

"While sera from 89% of patients displayed some neutralization capacity during their disease course, NAb (neutralizing antibody) generation prior to 14 days of disease onset emerged as a key factor for recovery. These data indicate that COVID-19 mortality does not correlate with the cross-sectional antiviral antibody levels per se, but rather with the delayed kinetics a of NAb production."

The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare announced on [10 Jan 2021] that it has confirmed a mutant of the new coronavirus in 4 men and women who arrived at Haneda Airport from Brazil. Takaji Wakita, director of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said that although there are some commonalities with the mutants reported in the United Kingdom and South Africa, there are some differences, so he sees them as a new type. There is no evidence of high infectivity or severity, and it is under investigation.

The 4 arrived from the state of Amazonas in northwestern Brazil on [2 Jan 2021] and tested positive for airport quarantine. Of these, a teenage woman is asymptomatic, a teenage man has a fever, a woman in her 30s has a sore throat and headaches. A man in his 40s is hospitalized due to poor respiratory condition.

New mutant strain of new coronavirus detected in returnees from Brazil
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
- New mutants have been detected in returnees from Brazil that share some of the mutations in common with those of concern for increased infectivity.
- The mutant strain is limited to information on gene sequences, and it is difficult to determine infectivity, pathogenicity, effects on testing methods and vaccines, etc. at this time.
- It is desirable to keep the infected person of the mutant strain under control in a private room and to carry out an active epidemiological survey including the source of infection, tracking and management of close contacts, clinical course, etc.
- Even for mutant strains, as in the past, it is recommended that individuals' basic infection prevention measures include avoiding 3-cs [closed spaces, crowded places, and close-contact settings], wearing a mask, and washing their hands.

On [6 Jan 2021], the National Institute of Infectious Diseases detected a new mutant strain of the new coronavirus in 4 travelers arriving from Brazil on [2 Jan 2021.

The novel mutant belongs to the B.1.1.248 strain (*1) and has 12 mutations in the spike protein (*2). Similar to VOC-202012 / 01 and 501Y.V2 of mutant strains that are concerned about increased infectivity, N501Y mutation is observed at the receptor binding site (*3) of peplomer protein, and E484K mutation is observed like 501Y.V2.

Mutations in E484 have been reported as escape mutations (*5) from monoclonal antibodies (*4) that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 (1,2). Furthermore, experimental data (3) that the E484K mutation was found in the escape mutant strain (*6) from the recoverer plasma and the mutation of E484 reduced the neutralizing antibody titer of the pseudotype virus (*7) in the recoverer plasma by about 10 times. (4) reported that it is difficult to suppress viral cell infection in vitro (in vitro) even in the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody induced in the serum of COVID-19 recoverers. Has been done. That is, there is a concern that the conventional immunity against the virus may be diminished against the virus having the E484 mutation.

In Brazil, there are reports of reinfection cases with mutant strains showing the E484K mutation of the B.1.1.248 strain (2021/01/06) (5), but they are not the same as the novel mutant strain.

*1 B.1.1.248 system:
Classification by molecular phylogenetic ID by Pangolin (COVID-19 Lineage Assigner Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages, https://cov-lineages.org/lineages.html ) , which is a classification method used for coronavirus disease . The UK VOC 20 2012/01 corresponds to B.1.1.7 and the South Africa 501Y.V2 corresponds to B.1.351. The new Brazilian mutant is classified as B.1.1.248 and is part of the B.1.1.28 lineage (downstream lineage) that was widespread in Brazil.

*2 Spike protein:
One of the proteins that make up the coronavirus. It is the part that is present on the surface of the virus and binds to human receptors when infecting cells, and this mutation can affect the susceptibility to infection.

*3 Receptor binding site:
The part of the spike protein that binds to receptors on the surface of human cells when the virus infects them.

*4 Monoclonal antibody that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2:
A single type of antibody that has the function of suppressing infection with the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). When infected with the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), various types of antibodies are produced from multiple immune cells in the body, but one type of antibody is usually produced from one immune cell. Among them, the antibody obtained from the cells obtained by selecting cells that produce antibodies that bind to the surface of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and suppress infection to cells, and proliferating only those cells. It is used for medical treatment.

*5 Escape mutation:
A gene mutation that makes it difficult for factors that inhibit the infection and growth of viruses, such as antibodies, to work. A viral mutant with such a mutation is called an escape mutant.

*6 Escape mutant strain from recoverer plasma:
A mutant strain resistant to antibodies found in recoverers as an immune response to new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection. By culturing the virus in vitro ( in vitro ) in the presence of the antibody, it is a mutant strain that has become predominant in the method of inducing and selecting a mutation resistant to the antibody.

*7 Pseudo-type virus:
A virus that expresses the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein on the surface of another virus particle, which is artificially created for the purpose of experiments and antibody tests.

[Seek and ye shall find. This virus is demonstrating rapid mutations that are being associated with increased transmissibility and possibly increased severity in certain instances (see section 4[B] below. It is clear that transmission has been increasing in both the northern and southern hemispheres. A key question is whether this is due to mutations favoring this or is it due to relaxing of guard with suboptimal adherence to NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions), or is it a mix of both? The isolates in Japan from northern Brazil are different from both the UK and South African variants.

More information is needed on whole genome sequencing of isolates in many countries that have been experiencing major increases in transmission to see if areas with surges are also experiencing increased prevalence of variant viruses. - Mod.MPP]

The Secretariat of Health of the State of Bahia (Sesab) confirms the 1st case of reinfection by SARS-CoV-2, through genetic sequencing. The E484K mutation was observed in the genetic sequence of the virus present in the 2nd episode, which is a mutation originally identified in South Africa. The patient in question, a 45-year-old woman residing in Salvador, contracted COVID-19 twice in an interval of more than 90 days, according to reports issued by Hospital São Rafael -- in May and October 2020.

On [22 Dec 2020], Hospital Sao Rafael officially communicated to the Bahia State Health Department (Sesab) about the suspected case of reinfection. From the analysis of samples sequenced by the SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Surveillance Center in real time in Brazil, of which the Central Public Health Laboratory of Bahia is part, the following conclusions were reached:

1. The 2 samples are grouped on 2 different sides and belong to 2 different sublineages: B.1.1.33 the sample from the 1st collection and B.1.1.248 the sample from the 2nd collection;
2. They present a profile of different mutations;
3. The identification in the sample referring to the 2nd collection (case of reinfection) of the mutation found in the new South African variant in the protein Spike located in the RDB (E484K).
In addition to genetic sequencing, other tests were performed, such as the quantification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, collected at different times in the case in question.

Suspected reinfections
Another 118 suspected cases of reinfection are being investigated in the state of Bahia in patients aged 5 to over 80 years. Of this total, there are 82 notifications for females and 36 for males.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dear Editor,

We have detected a confirmed case of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 with the 2nd episode due to the 'new variant' VOC-202012/01 of lineage B.1.1.7. The initial infection occurred in the 1st wave of the pandemic in the UK and was a mild illness. 8 months later, during the 2nd wave of the pandemic in the UK reinfection with the 'new variant' VOC-202012/01 was confirmed and caused a critical illness.

A 78 year old man with a history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, diabetic nephropathy on haemodialysis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), mixed central and obstructive sleep apnoea, ischaemic heart disease, with no history of immunosuppression, presented with fever during haemodialysis on [2 Apr 2020]. There were no other symptoms and he was discharged home. He had a mild illness with an uneventful recovery. Combined nose and throat (NTS) swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

E gene cycle threshold (Ct) value was 26.8, ORF1a Ct value was 26.4. Our service has been routinely screening all haemodialysis patients under our care since the 1st surge of infections in London; a total of 22 routine NTS swabs were sent between [5 May 2020] and [1 Dec 2020] and all tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (using the Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG assay detecting antibodies targeting viral nucleocapsid 'N' antigen) were detectable on 6 occasions between [4 Jun 2020] and [13 Nov 2020] with no evidence of antibody waning seen.

On [8 Dec 2020] a routine repeat NTS was sent. The relative light unit (RLU) value was 1348. A repeat sample was sent on [14 Dec 2020] and tested with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), with Ct values of 27.5 and 27.9 respectively. On [14 Dec 2020], he presented to A&E with a 3 days history of shortness of breath (SOB) which had worsened overnight. He was brought in by ambulance in extremis, very short of breath (SOB) and unable to talk, with severe hypoxia, leading to emergency intubation. Severe COVID-19 pneumonia complicated by myocardial infarction with resulting trifascicular block and atrio-ventricular (AV) dissociation and pulmonary oedema was diagnosed. He was admitted to ITU [intensive therapy unit] treated with co-amoxiclav, clarithromycin, dexamethasone, and required cardiac pacing, haemodynamic vasopressor support, haemofiltration.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of the viral genome was performed in house on stored aliquots of the samples collected on [2 Apr 2020] and [8 Dec 2020]. Briefly, samples were sequenced with a multiplex PCR based approach according to the modified ARTIC protocol with version 3 primer set. 85.92% genome coverage was obtained on the sample dated [2 Apr 2020]. Phylogenetically, the isolate belonged to lineage B.2, with no mutations observed in the S region. 95.6% genome coverage was obtained on the sample dated [8 Dec 2020]. Phylogenetically, the isolate belonged lineage B.1.1.7 and accumulated 18 amino-acid replacements across the genome. The following amino-acid replacements were observed in the 'S' region: N501Y, A570D, D614G, P681H, T761I, S982A, D1118H. Also, deletions were present in the spike region: Y144 (21991-21993) and HV 69-70 (21765-21770).

The WGS results confirm reinfection with a different lineage 8 months after initial infection in the absence of significant immunocompromise. The reinfection was with the 'new variant' VOC202012/01. This variant has been recently identified in the UK, and is rapidly spreading, especially in London and the South East of England and South Wales and may be responsible for a surge in new cases here [England] (1). The 'new variant' is characterised by numerous mutations in the spike region which causes diagnostic escape in PCR assays using the 'S' gene as a target for amplification (1,2). The numerous spike region mutations also raise questions about possible immune escape and/or vaccine evasion and likelihood of reinfection.

Reinfection has been confirmed before in a handful of cases worldwide, but confirmation of reinfection relies on WGS and so cases may be drastically underreported. Regular PCR screening of our dialysis cohort and access to in-house WGS allowed reinfection to be confirmed in this instance. The development of reinfection in this case may just reflect waning immunity after 8 months since primary infection in a high-risk individual with multiple comorbidities. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were still present shortly before onset of reinfection, with no evidence of antibody waning. This may raise some concerns about immune evasion by this new variant, which is a concern with the high number of spike region mutations seen. We have no assay for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies recognising spike antigen, and neutralising antibody studies are pending. The antibodies detected recognise 'N' antigen, so drawing conclusions is difficult. The group of mutations identified in VOC-202012/01 appears to have significantly increased transmissibility compared to previously described mutations or haplotypes, but there is as yet no evidence of increased pathogenicity associated with these mutations (1). In this case the initial illness was mild, and the reinfection with the new variant was critical/life-threatening. More severe illness on the 2nd episode has been reported before in confirmed reinfections not caused by VOC- 202012/0 (1,4). Rapid work on learning about immune, vaccine and diagnostic escape is needed, as are data on severity of illness caused by VOC202012/01.

[This case is disconcerting given the history of detectable neutralizing antibodies prior to the onset of illness. Is this a harbinger of the coming future with these variants and immune escape/evasion or was this a rare event? The severe clinical presentation on the reinfection also raises concerns about antibody-dependent enhancement (with spill over concerns re: vaccination). As I've said before, this virus keeps throwing curve balls at efforts of understanding what is going on, how to treat it and how to prevent it. - Mod.MPP]

The government on Sunday [10 Jan 2021] recorded 245 new coronavirus cases, including 224 local transmissions, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to date to 10 298. The Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration (CCSA) said that aside from the 224 local transmissions, 21 infections were found among new arrivals in the country and in quarantine centres. No new deaths were reported, leaving the accumulated toll at 67.

CCSA spokesman Taweesilp Visanuyothin said Samut Sakhon was the province with the most new local infections (73), followed by Chon Buri (49), Samut Prakan (23), Bangkok (22), and Rayong (15). The figures in Samut Sakhon included 22 migrant workers found in active testing, he added.

Thais returning from work at the Sky Complex casino in Myawaddy to Mae Sot district of Tak led the tally of imported infections -- with 17 cases -- while 2 Thai nationals arriving from Turkey and India tested positive for COVID-19. 2 foreigners -- a US citizen from the United States and a Hungarian -- wrapped up the infections from overseas.

The infected Thai nationals who worked at the Myawaddy casino returned to Mae Sot through a checkpoint on Thursday [7 Jan 2021], after Thailand temporarily opened the border to allow them to escape the outbreak in the Myanmar border town.

The virus has spread to 58 provinces since the new outbreak started in mid-December [2020], with Samut Sakhon logging the highest number of infections at 3261.

Mainland China saw its biggest daily increase in COVID-19 cases in more than 5 months, the country's national health authority said on Monday [11 Jan 2021], as new infections in Hebei province surrounding Beijing continued to rise.

A county in the northeastern Heilongjiang province on Monday [11 Jan 2021] moved into lockdown after reporting new novel coronavirus infections, state television also reported separately.

Hebei accounted for 82 of the 85 new local infections reported on [10 Jan 2021], the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement, with Liaoning Province also reporting 2 new cases and Beijing reporting one new case. The country also saw 18 new imported infections from overseas.

The total number of new COVID-19 cases stood at 103, the highest since 127 cases were reported on [30 Jul 2020]. Though the new cases being reported in recent days remain a small fraction of what the country saw at the height of the outbreak in early 2020, authorities are moving aggressively to curb the spread of the disease and prevent another national wave of infections.

Shijiazhuang, Hebei's capital and the epicentre of the new outbreak in the province, is in lockdown, with people and vehicles barred from leaving the city as authorities move to curb the spread of the disease. Public transport in the city has also been halted. The city's steps are in line with a usual package of COVID-19 restrictions local authorities in China implement when they see a cluster emerge.

Wangkui county, under the jurisdiction of Suihua city in Heilongjiang province, reported 8 new asymptomatic cases and moved on Monday [11 Jan 2021] to close all non-essential businesses, banned people from leaving the city and blocked all non-essential traffic, state television also reported. Each family in the county can have one person leave their home once every 3 days to buy necessities, the report said.

Hebei's highway authority said on Monday [11 Jan 2021] that multiple sections of highways in the province have been closed for COVID-19 prevention and that vehicles registered to Shijiazhuang and Xingtai will be asked to go back. The latter city has also reported COVID-19 cases in recent days. The NHC reported 76 new asymptomatic patients for all of mainland China, up from 27 a day earlier. China does not count these individuals, who are infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes the disease but not exhibiting symptoms, as confirmed COVID-19 cases.

Total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 87 536, while the death toll remained unchanged at 4634.

Liaoning has been reporting cases since 18 Dec 2020, with the total during this period (as of 10 Jan 2021) being 86 cases. Heibei started reporting this current outbreak on 2 Jan 2021, and as of today 10 Jan 2021 there have been a total of 269 cases. The last major outbreak in Beijing ran from 11 Jun 2020 to 5 Jul 2020 when there were a total of 336 cases reported - during that period there were also 21 cases reported in Hebei associated with that outbreak.

The National control measure involves total lockdown in the affected areas, so far with success in interrupting transmission.

[Weekend artifact is prominent. Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Ghana. Countries showing marked decreases in reports include the USA (down 33.1% in the past 48 hours, Brazil down 50.4% in the past 24 hours; globally the total reported cases is down 28.9% in the past 48 hours and the global reported deaths is down 46.1% in the past 48 hours.

In the past 24 hours, the USA (217 396), the UK (54 940), and Brazil (29 792) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 8277 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (9-10 Jan 2021).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (11 countries -- down from 16 countries yesterday 9 Jan 20210) include the USA, UK, Brazil, Russia (22 851), Italy (18 625), South Africa (17 421), India (16 085), France (15 944), Colombia (15 537), Germany (15 018), and Mexico (10 003). A total of 51 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours (down from 57 countries on Friday 8 Jan 2021); 23 of the 51 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 13 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region (note the biggest decrease is in the European countries).

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 19.4%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 18.5%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 17.2% increase in daily reported cases and an 18.5% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: Even with weekend artifacts related to decreased reporting of newly confirmed cases and deaths, there are still over half a million newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, and comparative 7-day averages demonstrate continued growth of the pandemic in terms of reported cases and deaths, especially in Brazil and the USA. The global cumulative reported cases are over 90.6 million with over 1.94 million reported deaths. The elevated comparative 7-day averages are probably indicative of the Christmas and New Year's holiday travel and gatherings. - Mod.MPP]
