A Vaccine for All Types of Influenza
-----------------------------------------
Scientists are making a vaccine that could give lifelong protection
against all types of flu in a single jab. Currently, at risk people
in the UK -- the elderly and ill -- need annual flu jabs, and there
is no jab available yet guaranteed to beat avian influenza.
Biotechnology firm Acambis, in Cambridge, UK says it hopes its jab
will target numerous mutations that presently allow flu to evade
attack. However, the work is very early and is years off being tested
in humans.
Each year, winter flu kills around 4000 people in the UK. Globally,
between 500 000 and one million people die each year from influenza.
If the avian influenza virus currently circulating in Asia were to
mutate and spread from person to person, it could kill as many people
as the 1918 Spanish flu, which claimed between 20 and 40 million
lives, experts have warned.
Current influenza vaccines work by giving immunity to 2 proteins
called hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, which are found on the
surface of flu viruses. However, these proteins keep mutating, which
means doctors have to keep making new vaccines to keep up. Scientists
at Acambis' laboratory in the US, together with Belgian researchers
at Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, are focusing
their efforts on a different protein, called M2, which does not
mutate, as well as other technology that they cannot disclose yet for
commercial reasons. If successful, a single shot of the vaccine could
protect a person against all strains of influenza virus, they
believe. Dr. Thomas Monath, chief scientific officer at Acambis,
said: "We aim to avoid the need for annual re-engineering and
manufacture of the new product, something that is not yet possible
with existing vaccines. The need to develop a new vaccine each time a
different influenza strain emerges often results in long delays
before a population can be protected. The technology also has special
importance as a potential means of protecting human populations
against pandemic influenza strains. So far, the vaccine has only been
tested in animals. The scientists said it would take several years
before large-scale human trials could be done.
Professor Maria Zambon, a flu expert at the Health Protection Agency,
said: "We welcome advances in the process of developing novel flu
vaccines and vaccination techniques. However, this vaccine is still
very early in a vaccine development pipeline, and it will take some
time to establish how this vaccine performs in human trials and
whether it can proceed to being licensed for use in the UK."
Professor Karl Nicholson, professor of infectious diseases at
Leicester University, said: "It would be enormously helpful to
mankind to have just the one vaccine, but, sadly, I think it is a
long way off." He said it might be 10 years before any such product
could be ready for widespread use in humans.

Avian Influenza Vaccine Called Effective in Human Testing
-----------------------------------------------
Government scientists say they have successfully tested in people a
vaccine that they believe can protect against the strain of avian
influenza that is spreading in birds through Asia and Russia. Health
officials have been racing to develop a vaccine because they worry
that, if that strain mutated and combined with a human influenza
virus to create a new virus, it could spread rapidly through the
world. (The vaccine cannot lead to such a situation, because it is
made from killed virus.) Tens of millions of birds have died from
infection with the virus and culling to prevent the spread of the
virus. About 100 people have been infected, and about 50 [112 and 57
as of 5 Aug 2005 - Mod.CP] have died from this strain of the avian
influenza virus, called A(H5N1). So far, there has been no sustained
human-to-human transmission, but that is what health officials fear,
because it could cause a pandemic. And that fear has driven the
intense research to develop a vaccine.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, said that while the vaccine that has
undergone preliminary tests could be used on an emergency basis if a
pandemic developed, it would still be several months before that
vaccine is tested further and, if licensed, offered to the public. He
cautioned: "We don't have all the vaccine we need to meet the
possible demand. The critical issue now is, can we make enough
vaccine, given the well-known inability of the vaccine industry to
make enough vaccine."
An earlier human vaccine against A(H5N1) avian influenza virus was
prepared after it 1st appeared in the world, in Hong Kong in 1997.
That vaccine was never fully developed or used, and the strain has
mutated since then. In interviews over recent days, Dr. Fauci has
said that tests so far have shown that the new vaccine produced a
strong immune response among the small group of healthy adults under
age 65 who volunteered to receive it, although the doses needed were
higher than in the standard influenza vaccine offered each year. The
vaccine, developed with genetic engineering techniques, is intended
to protect against infection, not to treat those who are sick.
Further tests are expected to be conducted among 2 groups -- people
65 and older, and children -- over the next several months. Dr. Fauci
expressed confidence that they would confirm the success of the 1st
tests and answer remaining scientific questions.
Because the vaccine is made in chicken eggs, "a potential major
stumbling block" to successful mass production is the number of eggs
farmers can supply to vaccine manufacturers, Dr. Fauci said. If
manufacturers can overcome such hurdles, the new vaccine could go far
in averting a possible pandemic of human influenza, Dr. Fauci said.
Only a small number of human cases of A(H5N1) influenza have been
found. Although a few cases may have been transmitted from person to
person in Asia, the A(H5N1) strain has not garnered enough strength
to spread widely among humans anywhere. As of Friday [5 Aug 2005]
night, according to the World Health Organization in Geneva, the
avian strain has killed 57 of the 112 people it has been known to
infect in 4 countries. They are Cambodia (4 cases), Indonesia (one
case), Thailand (17 cases), and Viet Nam (90 cases).
The additional tests are needed in part to determine the optimal dose
of vaccine; how many shots people will need for protection; and
whether adding another ingredient called an adjuvant to the vaccine
could raise the potency of lower doses, stretching the number of
people that could be protected. Even when these tests are completed,
more time will be needed before the Food and Drug Administration can
license the human vaccine and before policy makers determine the when
and how it should be administered.
Government researchers and others developed the vaccine, which is
produced by Sanofi-Pasteur, a French vaccine company that is now part
of Aventis. The government could decide to release the product under
emergency conditions if an A(H5N1) influenza pandemic struck before
the testing process was completed. Although cautioning that the
vaccine has not been fully tested, Dr. Fauci said that the initial
test findings have given the federal government enough confidence to
start the process of adding millions more doses of the vaccine to the
2 million it has bought. The present supply is stored in bulk form,
and "we cannot put it in vials until we find out what the right dose
is," Dr. Fauci said. The manufacturer needs to know the dose and
regimen to determine how much more vaccine it can produce and make
available to the United States and other customers.
Scientists had to test the human avian influenza vaccine on
volunteers, because the A(H5N1) strain differs in significant ways
from the conventional strains that cause human influenza. Also, the
influenza shots that are offered each year are derived from the human
strains that are circulating most widely at the time experts choose
the components of the next vaccine. Human influenza viruses mutate
enough each year to force changes in the standard vaccines. Such
vaccines produce a broader and stronger immunity, because recipients
build up an immunity to influenza from repeated immunizations and
exposure to the influenza virus. In a sense, the standard annual
influenza shots are booster doses. But the A(H5N1) vaccine is a
primary immunization because, having had no exposure to that virus,
people lack any immunity to the avian strain.
The United States is thought to be the only country that has produced
a human vaccine against the A(H5N1) influenza strain. Australia,
Canada, France, Japan [and the UK] are among countries where
scientists are trying to develop human avian influenza vaccines,
according to the World Health Organization.
Dr. Fauci's institute also contracted with Chiron, which is based in
Emeryville, California to make another A(H5N1) vaccine. But tests of
the Chiron vaccine have not started because of delays related to
prior contamination found in Chiron's plants. Dr. Fauci said his
institute has 8000 doses of the Chiron human A(H5N1) vaccine and
hopes to start testing it in volunteers in late fall. The tests will
follow the same steps taken with the Sanofi-Pasteur vaccine, he said.

[ProMED-mail has no commercial or other association with any of the

reports. The information is posted merely to give an impression of
the state of progress in development of vaccine for use in
containment of a possible pandemic influenza virus arising in the
course of the current H5N1 avian influenza outbreak in East Asia.
The problem with the approach described in the 1st report is that it
is innovative and a long way from resolution and, therefore, an
unlikely option for containment of a pandemic strain whose appearance
may be imminent. Its advantage is that it does not depend on close
matching of the H (or N) antigens. The approach described in the 2nd
report is disadvantaged by the lapse of time between choice of
vaccine strain and appearance of a pandemic virus which may have
diverged by progressive genetic mutation, or may even have acquired
non-homologous H (and/or N) antigens by reassortment. - Mod.CP]
