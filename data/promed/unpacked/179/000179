Please find below some information about the 2 imported cases of cholera in
France that have been notified recently to the WHO.
The first one concerned a 3-year-old girl, who started to suffer from
diarrhea and vomiting the day after coming back from holiday in Bali
(Indonesia). The National Reference Center for vibrios confirmed on 30 May
[2001 that it was _Vibrio cholerae_, group 01, type Ogawa. Clinical
evolution has been satisfactory.
The second case has been confirmed by the National Reference Center on 19
Jun [2001, with isolation of _Vibrio cholerae_, group 01, type Ogawa. The
patient was a 27-year-old woman, coming back from Lome, Togo. She recovered
after hospitalisation and treatment.
Every cholera case occurring in France is systematically notified to the
WHO. The origin of contamination and microbiological type, when identified,
are also declared. As a general rule, clinical and biological information
about the case and place of contamination are available directly from the
WHO in Geneva (Epidnations).

[We thank Dr Quatresous for these important details. It is a pity that WHO
does not include them in its published Notifications. Togo has notified 194
cases of cholera (16 fatal) occurring between 10 and 30 Jun 2001 (Source:
WHO/WER 13 Jul 2001, Notifications of diseases received from 6 to 12 Jul
2001). Indonesia has not notified any cases of cholera this year. - Mod.JW
