[1] Shortening coronavirus quarantine period
Date: Wed 25 Nov 2020 1:32 AM ET

https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/11/25/938744923/cdc-likely-to-recommend-shortening-coronavirus-quarantine-period


Federal health officials are likely to shorten their recommendation for how long people should quarantine to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus from the current 14 days to as few as 7.

Current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendations call for 2 weeks of isolation from the last contact with a person known to have COVID-19. However, Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said Tuesday [24 Nov 2020] that health officials were rethinking that recommendation, citing "a preponderance of evidence that a shorter quarantine complemented by a test might be able to shorten that quarantine period."

"We are actively working on that type of guidance right now, reviewing the evidence, but we want to make absolutely sure," he said, adding that "these kind of recommendations aren't willy-nilly."

The exact language of the new guidelines and when they might be announced remains unclear, but according to a federal official who asked not to be named because they weren't authorized to speak publicly about the issue, the recommended quarantine time is likely to be just 7 to 10 days for people who then test negative for the virus.

Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said she would welcome such a revision. "I was really glad to hear CDC is considering this," she told NPR in an email. "Shortening quarantine recommendations to focus on the period of time during which the vast majority of people who are exposed to the virus are likely to become contagious is a smart, pragmatic move that is likely to boost compliance."

"Right now, contact tracing efforts in the US are severely hindered by deep disincentives for contacts of cases to quarantine," Nuzzo said. "A 7 or 10-day quarantine recommendation may be easier for people to bear and hopefully may help get more contacts of cases to comply."

Last month [October 2020], the CDC revised its language on what it defines as "close contact" with a COVID-19 infected person. Previously, health officials considered close contact to be spending 15 consecutive minutes within 6 feet [2 m] of a person with a confirmed case. But the CDC changed its definition to being within 6 feet of an infected person for a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.

The change followed a study by the CDC and Vermont health officials finding that multiple short exposures to people confirmed to have COVID-19 led to transmission of the virus.

[From the beginning of this pandemic, global, regional, and country level guidance have been updated periodically as more information about the virus became available about the virus, its transmission, infectious period, shedding times, and other factors impacting the epidemiology. The operating words here are 'practical' and 'pragmatic', yet evidence-based so as to ensure that the transmission chain is effectively disrupted, while ensuring that essential activities can be continued as best as possible.- Mod.UBA]

[2] COVID-19 mutations and infectious potential
Date: Wed 25 Nov 2020 18:32 GMT

Coronavirus has not mutated to become more infectious, according to a scientific study that debunks a widespread theory.

Most coronavirus cases seen globally feature a specific genetic mutation called D614G which is different to the original strain that emerged in Wuhan last year [2019] and experts feared was more infectious than the original version.

But UCL [University College London] researchers looked at more than 46 723 cases of COVID-19 from 99 countries and assessed how mutations appeared and if they altered transmissibility.

Scientists identified 12 706 total mutations in SARS-CoV-2 -- the virus which causes COVID-19 -- and none of them were found to boost infectivity.

This includes D614G which is found on the spike of the coronavirus and allows it to bind to human cells, a mechanism that allows it to infect people.

Other academics doing lab studies, not genetic reviews, had previously found D614G made the virus more infectious but the UCL researchers believe it became dominant by chance, not by design.

They say their conclusions may disagree with previous findings due to different methodologies and that D614G became so prevalent because it was an early mutation which happened to get carried around the world in the early days of the pandemic, not because it is more infectious.

UCL scientists found the D614G mutation in 77.8 per cent of all cases but say it does not make the virus more infectious. The study, published in the journal Nature Communications [see reference below], explains mutations in coronaviruses can develop in three different ways.

These are: mistakes resulting from copying errors as the virus replicates inside the human body; through interactions with other viruses infecting the same cell; and changes induced by the host's or a person's own immune system.

Most mutations to SARS-CoV-2 are due to the later, the researchers discovered. First and corresponding author Lucy van Dorp, of UCL Genetics Institute, added, 'Fortunately, we found that none of these mutations are making COVID-19 spread more rapidly, but we need to remain vigilant and continue monitoring new mutations, particularly as vaccines get rolled out.'

Based on a modelling of the virus's evolutionary tree, the scientists said they found no evidence any of the common mutations are increasing the virus's transmissibility.

Instead, they found most common mutations have a neutral impact on the virus, neither hindering or enhancing its ability to spread.

[3] Malaysia: outbreak in PPE manufacturing plant, shortages
Date: Tue 24 Nov 2020

Malaysia's Top Glove Corp., the world's largest maker of rubber gloves, said Tuesday [24 Nov 2020] it expects a 2-to-4-week delay in deliveries after more than 2000 workers at its factories were infected by the coronavirus, raising the possibility of supply disruptions during the pandemic.

Top Glove said it has temporarily stopped production at 16 factories in Klang, a town outside Kuala Lumpur, since [17 Nov 2020] to screen workers, with its remaining 12 facilities in the area operating at much reduced capacities.

The government on Monday ordered 28 Top Glove factories in Klang to shut down in stages to allow workers to undergo screening and mandatory quarantine after 2,453 factory workers tested positive for COVID-19.

The health ministry reported [23 Nov 2020] 1511 more cases in the area on Tuesday [24 Nov 2020], but didn't say how many were factory workers. The cluster contributed to a record daily high of 2188 cases nationwide, bringing Malaysia's total cases to 58 847. The cluster in the Klang area is currently the most active in the country with 4036 cases.

Top Glove says it produces about 90 billion rubber gloves a year, about one quarter of the world's supply, and exports to 195 countries. It has seen profits soar amid rising demand for its products due to the pandemic.

"We expect delays in some deliveries by about 2 to 4 weeks, as well as a longer lead time for orders, and estimate a possible 3% impact on projected annual sales for financial year 2021," Top Glove said in a statement.

"To minimize the impact on our customers, we are allocating sales orders to unaffected factories and rescheduling deliveries where possible," it said, without elaborating.

It said it is working closely with the authorities and implementing stringent health measures, including daily disinfection of the workers' dormitories and its factories. Top Glove reportedly has about 13 000 workers at its 28 factories in Klang.

It employs a total of 21 000 workers in its 41 factories in Malaysia and 6 others in Thailand, Viet Nam, and China.

[Ensuring a constant supply of basic personal protective equipment (PPE) which includes gloves for the rapid responders and healthcare workers is an essential component of the control measures towards the COVID-19 pandemic.

PPE for coronavirus (COVID-19) includes surgical masks, particulate filter respirators (N95 or equivalent), gloves, goggles, glasses, face shields, gowns, and aprons. The ability to limit the transmission of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting requires infection prevention and control measures, and PPE is a fundamental element thereof. This is essential to limit the acquisition and transmission of the virus to protect both health professionals, the patients they care for, and the wider community. Protecting health professionals not only limits disease spread, but also ensures that there are adequate numbers of staff to cope with inevitable increasing demands for healthcare services in the weeks and months ahead.

When used correctly, PPE functions as a physical barrier to the transmission of infectious particles present in bodily fluids. It also protects patients from transmission via the contaminated hands or clothing of healthcare staff.

The greatly increased need for PPE caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has caused PPE shortages, posing a tremendous challenge to healthcare systems, which is likely to be further compounded by temporary or long term shutdown of manufacturing facilities due to COVID-19 cases. - Mod.UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet).

Data by country, area, or territory for 25 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov25_1606386566.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 39.5% of daily case numbers and 22.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 25.2 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Colombia, and Argentina. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Chile and Costa Rica. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Peru, Panama, and Guatemala.

- The European region reported 41.1% of daily case numbers and 59.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 17.5 million. Countries not reporting cases today (25 Nov 2020) include Israel, Sweden, and Kazakhstan, among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Poland, Russia, Italy, Germany, Ukraine, and UK. There are 24 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 6.8% of daily case numbers and 9.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.89 million cases. Iran is dominant, with continuing record-breaking highs, followed by Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, and the UAE. Libya reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000, while Sudan, and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.46 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, followed by Algeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Botswana, Ghana, Uganda, Nigeria, Mozambique, and Angola.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 0.34% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.85 million cases. Malaysia is dominant, followed by Japan, Philippines, South Korea, French Polynesia, Guam, Mongolia, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 10.4% of the daily newly reported cases and 6.7% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 10.5 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically unchanged on the regional levels with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 80% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. At the country level, Malaysia has overtaken Japan as the dominant country in the Western Pacific region; Italy maintains dominance in the European region, although France has the highest cumulative case count. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (182 955), Brazil (45 449), and India (44 699) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 113 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (24-25 Nov 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include the USA, Brazil, India, Italy (25852), Russia (23 675), Germany (20 825), UK (18 213), France (16 282), Poland (15 356), Ukraine (13 882), Iran (13 843), and Mexico (10 335). A total of 61 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 61 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and 2 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 13%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 10.8%.

Impression: The global daily reported cases continue to increase with over 600 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.UBA]
