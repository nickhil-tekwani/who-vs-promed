The investigation into the current outbreak of _Salmonella_ has been helped
by the public reporting 79 sightings of dead birds to the Ministry of
Agriculture and Forestry (MAF). MAF earlier made an appeal for help in the
investigation into an outbreak of _Salmonella_ in sparrows is suspected to
be linked to an increase of reported cases in humans.
Last week the Canterbury Medical Officer of Health, Dr Mel Brieseman, said
37 human cases of the disease have been notified in the past 10 weeks.
Most cases, including the death of a 70-year-old Christchurch man, involved
a strain not normally seen in humans, called type 160, the same strain
killing sparrows in Canterbury, Marlborough, Manawatu and Waikato.
There have since been sightings of dead birds in other areas from Northland
to the West Coast, with groups of up to 400 dead birds being reported,
though most sighting are still confined to Canterbury.
The MAF program coordinator, Roger Poland, said they had not yet identified
one particular strain of _Salmonella_ as causing all of the deaths so it
was too early to determine if it was spreading throughout the country.
The health authorities are currently carrying out tests to establish links
to the sparrow deaths, as well as investigating a number of cases of
salmonellosis in humans.
