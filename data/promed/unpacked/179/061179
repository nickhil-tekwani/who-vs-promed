The Ministry of Health is investigating a cluster of 14 suspected cases of hepatitis A that have occurred over the last 3 weeks in Trio Village, Stann Creek District. One such case has been confirmed by laboratory testing.

Hepatitis A is a food and waterborne disease with symptoms that may include yellowing of the eyes and skin, dark urine, light-colored stool along with mild fever, vomiting, diarrhea and loss of appetite among others. This self-limiting disease can also be contracted from close contact with infected individuals.

The Ministry advises the public to take necessary precautions (as listed below) to prevent contamination and spread of the virus:
- Wash hands properly using soap and clean water especially before preparing or serving food, after using the toilet and after changing diapers.
- Wash all vegetables, fruits and other raw food with clean water before eating it.
- Do not consume contaminated water or ice. Boil and treat all drinking water with chlorine.
- Disinfect contaminated dishes, toilets and common surfaces.

Since the start of the year [2013], a few cases have been identified, mainly in the rural communities of the Corozal, Cayo and Toledo Districts. We are aggressively conducting house-to-house health education and environmental cleanup campaigns to treat the cases in all the affected areas.

[Belize is located on the northeastern coast of Central America. It is the only country in the area where English is the official language, although Kriol and Spanish are more commonly spoken. Belize is bordered to the north by Mexico, to the south and west by Guatemala and to the east by the Caribbean Sea. Its mainland is about 290 km (180 miles) long and 110 km wide. It supports a population of 312 698 inhabitants (2010 census). A map of Belize can be accessed at: http://www.lonelyplanet.com/maps/central-america/belize/.

Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe illness. Hepatitis A virus is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and water, or through direct contact with an infectious person. Hepatitis A is associated with a lack of safe water and poor sanitation. Improved sanitation and the hepatitis A vaccine are the most effective ways to combat the disease. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms and fulminant hepatitis (acute liver failure), which is associated with high mortality.

The disease can wreak significant economic and social consequences in communities. It can take weeks or months for people recovering from the illness to return to work, school or daily life. In developing countries, countries with transitional economies, and regions where sanitary conditions are variable, children often escape infection in early childhood. These improved economic and sanitary conditions may initially lead to a higher susceptibility in older age groups and higher disease rates, as infections occur in adolescents and adults, and consequently, large outbreaks can occur.

Several hepatitis A vaccines are available internationally. All are similar in terms of how well they protect people from the virus and their side-effects. No vaccine is licensed for children younger than one year of age. Nearly 100 percent of people develop protective levels of antibodies to the virus within one month after a single dose of the vaccine. Even after exposure to the virus, a single dose of the vaccine within 2 weeks of contact with the virus has protective effects. Still, manufacturers recommend 2 vaccine doses to ensure a longer-term protection of about 5-8 years after vaccination. Millions of people have been immunized worldwide with no serious adverse events. The vaccine can be given as part of regular childhood immunization programmes and can also be given with other vaccines for travellers.
