I would strongly agree with Dr. Calisher's remarks [archive no.
20080216.0614] and would like to emphasize the use of
immunohistochemistry (IHC) to detect viral antigens in fixed tissues.
Brazilian and Rockefeller scientists used "viscerotomy" to collect
tissues from fatal diseases surveilling for yellow fever by
histopathology. This technique obviated the difficulties of
collecting fresh tissue or blood and transporting via an intact cold
chain from remote sites. Pathological changes were highly indicative
of yellow fever in that setting and the system worked very well
(history discussed in articles reprinted in Soper, Fred L, ed J
Austin Kerr Building the Health Bridge. Selections from the works of
Fred L Soper 1st 1970, Indiana University Press Bloomington loc
78-77804 567pp).

Much later several of us thought that there would be potential
problems if yellow fever were re-introduced into the great cities of
Brazil in the face of dengue hemorrhagic fever. We found that
application of IHC could differentiate the 2 infections provided
selected monoclonal antibodies were applied (Hall WC, Crowell TP,
Watts DM, Barros VLR, Kruger H, Pinheiro F, Peters CJ: Demonstration
of yellow fever and dengue antigens in formalin-fixed
paraffin-embedded human tissues by immunohistochemistry. Am J Trop
Med Hyg 45:408-417, 1991). In addition to delineating the diagnosis
in 2 diseases that could not be distinguished reliably on purely
histopathological grounds, IHC would help in the diagnosis when virus
had cleared from serum, antibody tests were equivocal (a notorious
problem with flaviviruses), and fresh material was unavailable.

In 1995 when Ebola virus was epidemic in Kikwit, DRC several
scientists looked past the intensive attention focused during this
period to surveillance of sporadic virus activity over the broad
expanse of sub-Saharan Africa. Cases might be suspected, but the
danger and logistics of obtaining and moving samples to a central
area for diagnosis would prevent sampling the occasional suspicious
patient to answer the question of interepidemic virus activity. Skin
biopsies were obtained in expectation of finding vascular involvement
by IHC in these hemorrhagic fever patients. In fact, endothelium,
fibroblasts, and other cell types were involved in all patients
sampled (Zaki S, Sheieh W-J, Greer PW, Goldsmith CS, Ferebee T,
Katshitshi J, Tshioko FK, Bwaka MA, Swanepoel R, Calain P, Khan AS,
Lloyd E, Rollin P, Ksiazek TG, Peters CJ: A novel immunohistochemical
assay for the detection of Ebola virus in skin: implications for
diagnosis, spread, and surveillance of Ebola hemorrhagic fever. J
Infect Dis 179 (Suppl l):S36-47, 1999).

I hope this temporal span of a surveillance concept evolving with
increasing technology will emphasize the use of IHC and other
techniques that can be used on post-mortem tissues under conditions
of very limited infrastructure.

and very practical diagnostic test to the yellow fever diagnostic and
surveillance tool kit.
