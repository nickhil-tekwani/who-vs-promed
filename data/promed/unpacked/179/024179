Dengue, chikungunya and Zika in the context of COVID-19
-------------------------------------------------------

Situation summary
In the Region of the Americas, between epidemiological week (EW) 1 and EW 49 of 2021, a total of 1 324 108 cases of arboviral diseases were reported. Of those, 1 173 674 (89%) were dengue cases, 131 630 were chikungunya cases, and 18 804 were Zika cases.

Figure 1 shows the circulation pattern of dengue, chikungunya and Zika in the last 14 years. Since 2014, the impact of the introduction of chikungunya [December 2013] is observed. Similarly, after the introduction of the Zika in 2015, there was a widespread circulation of the virus in 2016. However, the circulation of dengue has continued to predominate.

In the Region of the Americas, the total number of cases of arboviral disease reported in 2021 as of EW 49 (1 324 108 cases) represents approximately a 45% relative decrease compared to the same period in 2020 (2 408 928 cases). In 2021, as of EW 49, in the Region of the Americas, during the first semester of 2021 an upward trend is observed in cases of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, which reached their peak in EW 14, EW 22 and EW 26, respectively (Figures 2-4).

In the Region of the Americas, dengue is the arbovirus that causes the highest number of cases, with epidemics that occur cyclically every 3 to 5 years. In 2019, the highest number of dengue cases occurred in the Region of the Americas; more than 3.1 million cases were reported, including 28 203 severe dengue cases and 1773 deaths. Additionally, the simultaneous circulation of other arboviruses, such as chikungunya and Zika, both transmitted by the same vector, _Aedes aegypti_, which is present in almost all the countries and territories of the Region of the Americas.

Since 2020, the circulation of the dengue virus and other arboviruses has been occurring simultaneously with the active transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in endemic countries and territories in the Region of the Americas. Meanwhile, new variants of concern of SARS-CoV-2 are detected and inadequate coverage of the vaccine against COVID-19, in endemic areas of these arboviruses where the public health and social measures to prevent COVID-19 are relaxing, pose a complex epidemiological situation, a high demand in health services, as well as a constant challenge for health systems in all its components and levels, including epidemiological surveillance.

Also, in December [2021], several countries in the Region could experience an increases in precipitation, which, depending on its magnitude and impact in the endemic areas of the aforementioned arboviruses, could constitute an additional burden of arbovirus diseases for health systems in affected areas.

The following is the epidemiological situation of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika in the Region of the Americas.

Dengue
------
Between EW 1 and EW 49 of 2021, a total of 1 173 674 cases of dengue were reported in the Region of the Americas, with a cumulative incidence rate of 118 cases per 100 000 population. The highest cumulative incidence rates have been reported in the following subregions, in decreasing order:
- the Southern Cone with 323 cases per 100 000 population,
- the Andean subregion with 89 cases per 100 000 population, and
- the Central American Isthmus and Mexico with 56 cases per 100 000 population.

In 2021, as of EW 49, of the 1 173 674 cases reported in the Region, 492 418 (42%) were laboratory-confirmed, and 2821 (0.24%) were classified as severe dengue. The highest number of severe dengue cases were reported by the following countries:
- Colombia with 864 cases,
- Honduras with 851 cases, and
- Brazil with 346 cases.
Also, during the same period, a total of 387 deaths were reported in the Region (case fatality rate [CFR]: 0.033%).

All 4 dengue virus serotypes (DENV 1, DENV 2, DENV 3, and DENV 4) are present in the Americas Region. In 2021, as of EW49, co-circulation of all 4 serotypes was detected in Colombia, Guatemala, Mexico, and Venezuela while in French Guiana, and Martinique, serotypes DENV 1, DENV 2, and DENV 3 have been co-circulating, and in Argentina, Honduras, and Paraguay, DENV 1, DENV 2, and DENV 4 have been co-circulating.

Advice to member states
-----------------------
Given the coexistence of COVID-19 with dengue and other arboviruses in several countries and territories of the Region of the Americas, the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) urges member states to continue strengthening surveillance, diagnosis, triage, and adequate treatment during the syndemic due to COVID-19 and arboviruses in endemic areas. At the same time, member states should establish strategies to facilitate access to health services for patients with dengue and other arboviruses, in addition to strengthening risk communication, so that patients with warning signs attend the health center in a timely manner. PAHO/WHO recommends the adequate triage of patients both for the timely detection of dengue warning signs and to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infections acquired in health care services.

PAHO/WHO reminds member states of the guidelines published in the 10 June 2020 PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on dengue and other arboviruses, available at: https://bit.ly/3mM1H36, as well as those recommendations related to COVID-19 included in the PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Alerts and Updates on COVID-19, available at: https://www.paho.org/en/epidemiological-alerts-and-updates.

[The above epidemiological update provides an interesting overview of occurrence of cases of infection by 3 important arthropod-borne virus diseases in the Americas during this time of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it seems odd that the advice to member states, above, does not mention mosquito vector control. Several promising new approaches to _Aedes aegypti_ vector control and _Wolbachia_ arbovirus inhibition are being implemented in the Americas currently.
