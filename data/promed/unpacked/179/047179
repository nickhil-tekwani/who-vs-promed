Werner D, Kronefeld M, Schaffner F, Kampen H. Two invasive mosquito species, _Aedes albopictus_ and _Aedes japonicus japonicus_, trapped in south-west Germany, July to August 2011 .
---------------------------------------
Summary: Adult females of 2 invasive species, _Aedes albopictus_ and _Aedes japonicus japonicus_, were collected for the 1st time in July and August 2011 in Germany. Previously, only immature stages of these species had been found in the country. Repeated detection of these species reveals the Upper Rhine Valley in southwest Germany to be a particularly sensitive region for the introduction and establishment of exotic mosquito species that needs careful observation.

As part of nationwide mosquito monitoring activities, 2 invasive mosquito species, _Aedes albopictus_ and _Ae. japonicus japonicus_, were trapped in the Upper Rhine Valley in southwest Germany (federal state of Baden-Wurttemberg), in the summer of 2011. Neither of these culicid species had been previously collected in Germany as adult specimens.

Background

_Ae. albopictus_ is a most efficient vector of numerous arboviruses. After its introduction into Italy in the late 1980s, it is now widely distributed in the Mediterranean region and continues to spread. While this species actively moves within short distances, the most important mode of long-distance dispersal is passive transportation by vehicles. Although _Ae. j. japonicus_ has been found carrying West Nile virus in the field, and its vector competence has been demonstrated in the laboratory for several viruses, the role of this species in the natural transmission of pathogens is unclear.

In summary, our study provides evidence of a 2nd introduction of _Ae. albopictus_ into Germany and the persistence of _Ae. j. japonicus_ in southwestern Germany. Our findings confirm that the German Upper Rhine Valley is a suitable area for the introduction and establishment of invasive species, further highlighted by our finding of an adult _Cs. longiareolata_. It is characterised by a very mild climate likely to offer suitable climatic conditions for the establishment of thermophilic exotic mosquito species. Our results call for further search for mosquito adults and immature stages, particularly of _Ae. albopictus_, in 2012 along the major traffic axes in southwestern Germany through intensified monitoring. Should additional adults or even immature stages of _Ae. albopictus_ be found, control measures such as insecticiding, reduction of potential breeding sites, and public health education should immediately be implemented. The further spread of _Ae. j. japonicus_ in southern Germany can probably only be prevented by extensive public education on the developmental demands of this species and appeals to the public to avoid producing artificial man-made breeding sites.

[It has been predicted that _Ae. albopictus_ is likely to expand its range into more northerly areas of Western Europe. The above report indicates that those predictions were accurate, and suggests that intensified mosquito surveillance will be increasingly important. Establishment of the 2 _Aedes_ species mentioned above would open the door to outbreaks of several arthropod-borne viruses, chikungunya and dengue viruses among them, should populations of these vector mosquito species reach substantial densities. Eradication of these 2 species in this area of Germany is unlikely.
