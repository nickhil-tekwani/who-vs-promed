Niger appealed for international help on Wednesday to cull poultry after an
outbreak of deadly avian flu, saying it lacked the necessary means to carry
out a slaughter in the affected areas. The semi-desert former French colony
is the 2nd sub-Saharan African nation after neighboring Nigeria to confirm
the presence of H5N1, a strain of bird flu which has killed more than 90
people in Asia and the Middle East since 2003.
The government in Niger, one of the poorest nations on earth, has ordered
the systematic culling of poultry in affected zones to stop the disease
spreading but said it needed equipment such as protective suits and
chemicals before it could begin.
"The cull has not started. It will not start until we have the appropriate
material," animal resources minister Abdoulaye Jina told Reuters. "We are
expecting the special overalls very shortly."
Tests on domestic ducks from Magaria, a town in southern Niger a few
kilometres from the border with Nigeria, showed positive results for H5N1,
the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) said on Monday.
Bird flu is only the latest scourge to hit Niger, where many outside the
capital Niamey live in mud-brick buildings on the edge of the Sahara desert
and one child in 4 dies before the age of 5 even in a normal year.
Drought and a locust plague left an estimated 3.6 million people -- 1/3 of
the population -- short of food in 2005 with malnutrition rates among
children particularly high in the border region with Nigeria where bird flu
has been found.
The head of the environmental protection brigade in the zone around Magaria
told Reuters he had not yet been given the order to begin culling poultry
but other measures had been tightened. "There is no movement of poultry in
the region. The sole avian farm in the town remains isolated and under
permanent surveillance," Commander Adamou Djibrila said.
The government said poultry would be killed in a 3 km (2 mile) radius
around infected sites, while all transport would be checked within a 10 km
security perimeter. The 20 avian farms around the country would be placed
under surveillance, government spokesman Mohamed Ben Omar said.
Experts fear weak detection systems in Africa -- which has an estimated 1.1
billion chickens, many in backyard farms -- combined with the easy movement
of birds across borders and limited awareness about the disease, could help
its spread.
Nigeria said on Monday that bird flu had been detected in 2 more of its
states, confirming fears the outbreak was widening in Africa's most
populous country. Several of the affected areas lie on or near the border
with Niger.
Niger had already banned poultry imports and the transport of poultry
between regions in a bid to stop bird flu taking hold in new areas. It
proposes to compensate farmers and householders 1000 CFA francs (USD 1.81)
per domestic bird destroyed in culls.

In such a poor country, culling of birds may protect the health of the
people -- only to have them die of starvation. It seems that a case could
be made for vaccination in some areas in an attempt to curb the spread of
disease. - Mod.TG]

Greece confirmed 3 more cases of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in
migratory birds on Wednesday, bringing the number to 19 since the disease
was first reported in the country in February 2006. The 3 swans were found
in the north, the same area where all other cases of bird flu have been
reported, the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement.
Greece is awaiting the results of tests on 7 other wild birds suspected of
infection, but has had no suspect domestic poultry cases.
Since the first case of bird flu was discovered in February 2006, Greece
has implemented a series of precautionary measures to stop the spread of
the disease. These include a 10 km (6 mile) quarantine around the areas
where the infected fowl were found. The Agriculture Ministry said no
further precautionary measures were needed.
According to wildlife experts, an unusually large number of migratory birds
have arrived in Greece this winter, forced south from their usual wintering
grounds by severe weather conditions in northern Europe.

Hungary has confirmed new cases of bird flu in a dead mallard and a gull
found in 2 different places near Budapest, and in 2 dead swans in southern
Hungary, a government spokesman said on Wednesday.
The announcement comes after the government confirmed Hungary's 8 case of
the H5N1 virus on Tuesday, detected in a swan just outside Budapest.
The mallard was found in Szentendre, a town north of Budapest, while the
gull was found in Szazhalombatta, 30 kilometres (20 miles) south of the
capital.
One of the dead swans reported on Wednesday was found 100 km south of
Budapest in Dunaszentbenedek, while the other was found in Nagybaracska,
where last week other dead swans had already tested positive for the H5N1
strain of avian influenza.
"Hungarian experts believe that the birds died most probably due to the
H5N1 virus, which in extreme cases could also endanger humans, but the
final word will have to be made by the Weybridge laboratory (in the United
Kingdom)," spokesman Andras Batiz said. The H5N1 virus has not been
detected in domestic poultry in Hungary.
