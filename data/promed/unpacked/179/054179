The director of epidemiology at the Ministry of Health, Miriam Morales,
said on Friday [7 May 2010] that an outbreak of Chagas disease, confirmed
in a community of Caracas, should not generate concern.

After confirming 4 cases and 5 more cases under investigation in the same
community, she said that the situation was being controlled by a joint team
of the Ministry of Health and the Environmental Health Directorate of the
Metropolitan District of Caracas.

"There is an alarming situation, but the outbreak is very focused, and we
have determined that there is no food for mass consumption involved. The
Ministry and the local health authorities are trying to determine which
foods [the most common form of transmission of the disease - Mod.EP] were
consumed that caused the infection in these people," Morales said, and went
on to say that field studies were being conducted to rule out a large
presence in the area and surrounding areas.

Morales underlined the importance of informing the general population of
such situations to generate social awareness about proper food intake and
maintenance of suitable housing conditions. In this regard, she said: "We
must inform people about the importance of safe food consumption and safe
cooking of the food prior to consumption."

She insisted that both in Venezuela and in other countries where similar
outbreaks have occurred, the cause of the disease is eating foods that have
been contaminated by the vector. Regarding the condition of the 4 cases of
confirmed Chagas disease, the epidemiologist said that they are
hospitalized, in stable condition and being treated.

The national director of epidemiology prioritized the importance of seeing
a doctor for any symptoms, because early treatment prevents complications.

The main symptoms of Chagas disease are frequent and persistent fever
between 39-40 C, abdominal pain, and feeling unwell.

The official said that the Ministry of Health is working in coordination
with the regional directorates of health in all aspects related to disease
prevention and the national plan of vector control, among which include
dengue fever, Chagas, and malaria.

[The usual alimentary transmission of Chagas has so far been with fruit and
sugar cane juice, which probably have been contaminated by the triatomid
bugs or their feces. The largest such outbreak was confirmed in Caracas in
2007 (see below), and another outbreak linked to contaminated guava juice
was reported in 2009. - Mod.EP
