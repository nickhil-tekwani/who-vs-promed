Turkish regions along the Bulgarian border are taking measures to
prevent the spread of food-and-mouth disease [FMD] from Bulgaria even
though the Bulgarian authorities claim the infection came from
Turkey.

The Turkish authorities have suspended all movement or evacuation of
animals in the region of Kirklareli, known in Bulgaria as Lozengrad,
the Bulgarian national radio reported citing Hasan Cebi, head of the
agricultural directorate in the province.

The measure will be in place until 9 May 2011. What is more, the
authorities in European Turkey are moving to start immunization of
local domestic animals against FMD. According to EU sources, the
European Commission has provided Turkey with 850 000 immunization
doses even though the Turkish state has not provided official
information.

"We've introduced these measures because of the FMD outbreak in
Bulgaria. We have urged the local population to be careful in order
not to allow the spread of the disease," the Kirklareli official is
quoted as saying.

In January-February and then again since mid March Bulgaria has been
struggling to contain the spread of FMD, a disease that does not
affect humans [but] is devastating to livestock.

[Though the Bulgarian news agency has titled the above report "Turkey
Moves to Protect Itself from Bulgaria's FMD Outbreak," the information
on animal movement restrictions, if confirmed, can also be interpreted
as indicative of locally suspected virus circulation. On the other
hand, the due immunization in Kirklareli, with vaccine provided by the
EC, could also be interpreted differently.

Since Turkish Thrace (including Kirklareli) is
officially/internationally recognised as an "FMD-free zone with
vaccination," all susceptible animals there are expected to have been
properly vaccinated (and hence protected). According to the prevailing
policy, in Thrace a trivalent vaccine (serotypes O,A, Asia 1) should
be used (in Anatolia, a bivalent vaccine, except cattle on the eastern
frontier). According to programme, bovines are vaccinated twice a year
(spring and autumn); ovine and caprine animals, once a year (in
Anatolia, in the autumn; in Thrace, in the spring; this is in need of
confirmation).

The FMD vaccines which have been used in 2010 were reportedly
produced by 3 contracted vaccine producers, one of them being local.
The current decision to (re?)vaccinate is in need of explanation. Has
the vaccine's quality (or certain batches thereof) been put in doubt?
Is a single annual vaccination of small ruminants conferring
protection for the entire year? Was the timing of their vaccination
(spring) optimal?

A recent report on Turkey's FMD control scheme and situation (see
also archived 20110107.0091) is available at
http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/commissions/docs/excom79/App16.pdf.
According to the said report, the total livestock population in Thrace
(which includes 5 districts: Istanbul, Canakkale, Tekirdag, Edirne,
Kirklareli) is as follows (2009 figures; in brackets, Kirklareli's
figures):

Cattle - 448 248 (106 228);
Buffalo - 7684 (1612);
Sheep - 643 764 (164 200);
Goat - 163 742 (42 212).

The destination of the 850 000 vaccine doses, reportedly provided by
the EC, is to be clarified. For a single vaccination of all cattle in
Thrace, 1.3 million monovalent vaccine doses are required. Is the
vaccine intended for one round of (booster) vaccination of the large
and small ruminants in one district, namely Kirlareli? - Mod.AS]
