Global COVID case level, deaths decline
---------------------------------------
After a recent decline, global COVID-19 cases last week stabilized, with countries in some parts of Asia still the main hot spots, the World Health Organization (WHO) said today [10 Aug 2022] in its weekly update on the pandemic.

Surges still accelerating in Japan and South Korea
--------------------------------------------------
Countries reported nearly 7 million cases last week, with the Western Pacific region the only WHO region to report rising cases. Surges are still underway in Japan, which is in its 7th wave. Japan's daily cases today [10 Aug 2022] topped 250 000 today for the 1st time, according to Kyodo News. [https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2022/08/09894e497929-japans-daily-covid-19-tally-hits-record-250000-cases.html]

In South Korea -- also experiencing a surge -- cases reached a 4-month high today [10 Aug 2022], reporting more than 151 000 cases, according to Yonhap News. Health officials said they expect daily cases to soon pass the 200 000 level. [https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20220810001652320?section=business/health]

Of nearly 7 million cases reported to the WHO last week, the 5 countries reporting the most cases were Japan, the United States, South Korea, Vietnam, and Turkey.

Deaths declined 9% last week compared to the previous week, with about 14 000 fatalities reported, the WHO said.

BA.5 omicron subvariant lineages continue to increase their dominance, rising from 68.9% to 69.7%. Meanwhile, BA.4 decreased slightly, as did BA.2 and BA.2.12.1. The WHO said BA.5 descendent (BA.5.X) are increasing in diversity, with more mutations in both the spike and non-spike regions of the virus. "WHO continues to monitor all lineages, including descendent lineages of VOCs [variants of concern], to track an increase in prevalence and change in viral characteristics," the WHO said.

US continues slow decline in cases, but not deaths
--------------------------------------------------
In the United States, the 7-day average for new daily cases is 108 820, according to a Washington Post analysis. The level is slowly declining from 7-day averages that were in the 130 000 range at the end of July [2022]. Deaths, often a lagging indicator, aren't showing a similar decline, with the 7-day average for new daily deaths at 499, according to the Post. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/national/coronavirus-us-cases-deaths/?itid=sf_coronavirus_sn_coronavirus-us-cases-deaths_1&state=US]

Meanwhile, a new survey on impacts of the pandemic on Americans from the Annenberg Public Policy Center found that more than half (54%) know someone who died from COVID-19 and 31% know someone who has experienced long COVID. However, 41% said they have returned to their "normal pre-COVID life," up from 16% in January [2022].

[2] Booster dose: heterologous vaccine approach

Mix-n-match COVID boosters may produce more durable immunity
------------------------------------------------------------
A single-center study today [10 Aug 2022] in JAMA Network Open finds longer-lasting humoral and cellular immune responses in US adults given a Johnson & Johnson (J&J) COVID-19 vaccine booster rather than a Pfizer/BioNTech booster after receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine at least 6 months earlier. [C. Sabrina Tan, Ai-ris Y. Collier, Jingyou Yu, et al. Durability of Heterologous and Homologous COVID-19 Vaccine Boosts. JAMA Netw Open. 2022;5(8):e2226335. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.26335]

Researchers from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center led the study of 68 adults in Boston given either a Pfizer or a J&J COVID-19 booster 6 or more months after receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. Enrollment took place from 12 Aug to 25 Oct 2021, and follow-up lasted 4 months.

The median age of the 41 recipients of a J&J booster was 36 years, while it was 35 in the 27 Pfizer recipients. Of all participants, 82% were women, 78% were White, 10% were Asian, 6% were Black, 6% were Hispanic or Latino, and 4% were of more than one race.

Antibodies fell dramatically 4 months after Pfizer booster
----------------------------------------------------------
Both boosters were tied to improved humoral and cellular immune responses, including against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern such as omicron. A Pfizer booster was tied to a rapid rise in omicron-neutralizing antibodies that peaked at a median titer of 1018 in week 2, and then dropped 6.9-fold to 148 at 4 months. In contrast, after a J&J booster, omicron-neutralizing antibodies rose, peaking at a median titer of 859 in week 4, and then fell only 2.1-fold to 403 by 4 months.

The findings, the researchers said, show that both COVID-19 vaccine strategies (same or different booster) increase omicron-neutralizing antibody and T-cell responses in Pfizer vaccine recipients but that responses at 4 months were higher after the J&J booster than after the Pfizer version.

"A heterologous mix-and-match vaccine strategy was associated with durable antibody and T-cell responses against the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant," they wrote. "These data suggest potential immunologic benefits of mix-and-match heterologous COVID-19 vaccine regimens and emphasize the importance of durability for COVID-19 vaccine boosting strategies."

The authors noted that previously reported rapid waning of SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses and clinical effectiveness after 3rd and 4th doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine has led to recommendations for frequent mRNA vaccine boosting, "which may be challenging to sustain as a long-term policy in the developed world and difficult to implement in the developing world," they wrote. "Future studies could explore reduced booster doses as well as omicron-containing boosters."

["The US Food and Drug Administration approved heterologous booster shots in October 2021, and the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently reduced the interval between primary and booster jabs from 6 to 5 months for those who originally received Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines. People who were given the J&J jab as their primary vaccine have been advised to get a booster shot after at least 2 months.

The CDC has made it clear that Comirnaty and Spikevax vaccines are the preferred option for boosters, due to the risk of serious adverse events associated with the J&J shot. While the mRNA jabs are recommended, the CDC said, a J&J booster may be considered for those who have had a reaction or an allergy to the mRNA vaccines, cannot access an mRNA booster, or wish to get the J&J shot despite the safety concerns.

After analysing the available evidence, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) last month (July 2022) said heterologous boosting "appears as good as or better in terms of immune responses than a homologous booster". The regulator has recommended that a mix-and-match strategy be considered for booster vaccinations to alleviate issues associated with vaccine acceptance, supply, and availability.

In September last year (2021), the UK drugs regulator MHRA approved the Pfizer-BioNTech, AZ and Moderna vaccines as boosters -- but the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has advised a preference for either Comirnaty or half of a Spikevax dose to be used for booster vaccinations. The AZ vaccine may be considered as a booster in situations where the mRNA jabs cannot be offered, the JCVI said.

Still, as booster use gets underway, with Israel even administering 4th shots, vaccine equity remains a major issue -- only 9.4% of people in low-income countries have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, according to Our World in Data.

World Health Organization head Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned against blanket booster programmes, saying there will be enough vaccines to inoculate the global adult population against COVID-19 if wealthy countries do not hoard doses."

[3] Omicron subvariants
Date: Tue 9 Aug 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/08/omicron-subvariants-gain-more-ground-including-ba46-midwest


Omicron subvariants gain more ground, including BA.4.6 in the Midwest
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Though the 7-day average for new daily COVID-19 cases is slowly declining, the more transmissible and immune-evasive omicron subvariants became even more dominant last week, with an offshoot called BA.4.6 gaining traction in some Midwestern states.

As health officials brace for a possible spike in activity after school starts and people begin gathering more indoors in the fall, new surveys shed light on vaccination uptake prospects, both in kids and in adults ages 50 and older.

Highest BA.4.6 proportions in Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska
--------------------------------------------------------------
In its weekly variant proportion updates today [9 Aug 2022], the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said the proportion of BA.5 viruses in sequenced samples last week rose from 84.5% to 87.1%, while BA.4 declined slightly, from 8.2% to 6.6%. However, the proportion of BA.4.6 viruses rose from 4.2% last week to 4.8% this week.

Midwestern states -- Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska -- are seeing the highest BA.4.6 proportions, where it makes up 13.2% of sequenced specimens. The subvariant has also been reported in other US regions, especially in the east.

Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in children last week grew for the 4th consecutive week, the American Academy of Pediatrics said in its latest weekly update. Nearly 97 000 cases were reported for the week ending [4 Aug 2022], and kids' illnesses are trending upward just ahead of the start of the new school year.

Polls shed light on vaccine uptake ahead
----------------------------------------
A recent poll from the Kaiser Family Foundation that assessed parents' views on vaccinating their children against COVID-19 found that many were reluctant owing to worries about safety and not enough testing. Others expressed concerns about access barriers. Nearly half of Black parents said they were concerned about taking time off work to get their young children vaccinated, and nearly half of Hispanic parents had concerns about getting their child vaccinated at locations they trust.

Also, a majority of parents of children under 5 said messaging about the vaccine from federal officials is confusing, especially where to get to the vaccine.

Meanwhile, a new poll from the University of Michigan revealed that 61% of people older than 50 who have already had at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine are likely to get vaccinated this fall [2022] with updated boosters that will include an omicron variant component. Levels were highest in seniors, Black adults over 50, and low-income groups.

Also, the poll suggested that intention to get the updated booster might increase if health providers specifically recommend them.
