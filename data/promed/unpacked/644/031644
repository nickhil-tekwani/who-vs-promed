Bacterial diseases infecting South Dakota wheat
-----------------------------------------------
There's an outbreak of bacterial disease in wheat
in South Dakota this year, says Lawrence Osborne,
SDSU Extension plant pathologist. The main
problems are black chaff and bacterial stripe.
"Infection occurs through wounds or natural
openings in the leaf, which may develop into
streaks and water-soaked tissue, usually
accompanied by yellowish to whitish ooze," he
says. "In dryer parts of the day, the ooze
appears shiny or scaly on leaf surfaces on or
near the dark, sunken streaks within the affected
leaves."

Some leaves may have an orange cast, but this
bacterial disease's appearance should not be
confused with tan spot, a fungal disease. "Tan
spot typically produces small diamond- or
lens-shaped, tan lesions on leaves, bordered with
bright yellow halos," Osborne says. "Stagonospora
blotch, another fungal leaf blight, may most
closely resemble the bacterial symptoms. Neither
fungal disease produces shiny or slimy ooze like
the bacteria, and the fungicides used against tan
spot will not help with bacterial disease."

Crop rotation, resistant cultivars, and proper
nutrient management are the primary means for
stopping black chaff. "Residue removal or burial
will help limit inoculum in a field, but for some
areas, may be impractical or undesirable," he
says. "Rainy weather, especially when high winds
are involved, tends to favor plant wounding and
thus, bacterial infection."

[2] _Heterodera filipjevi_ - Oregon, first report

nematode _Heterodera filipjevi on wheat in
Oregon. Plant Dis 2008; 92(7): 1136; DOI:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Plant and soil samples from an irrigated winter
wheat (_Triticum aestivum_) field near Imbler
(Union County), Oregon, were evaluated for root
diseases during April 2007. The field exhibited
patches with as much as 90 percent plant
mortality. Previous crops were winter wheat
(2004), chickpea (_Cicer arietinum_, 2005), and
spring wheat (2006). Stubble was baled and
removed, and the field was cultivated before
replanting to winter wheat in October [2006].
Patches of stunted seedlings (3- to 5-leaf stage)
appeared in March 2007. Stunted seedlings
exhibited chlorotic or necrotic lower leaves,
healthy younger leaves, few or no tillers,
rotting of lower culms and crowns, and light
brown roots with little or no branching. Signs
and symptoms of fungal pathogens were present on
affected plants.

Most small grain fields in Union County are
infested with _Heterodera avenae_ [cereal cyst
nematode] but none of the roots, on either
healthy or stunted plants, exhibited the bushy
branching pattern typical of sites where _H.
avenae_ females penetrate and encyst. Extraction
of motile nematodes from soil revealed high
populations of _Pratylenchus neglectus_,
_Tylenchorhynchus_ spp., and a species initially
thought to be _H. avenae_. Cysts were also
extracted.

During PCR (polymerase chain
reaction)-restriction fragment length
polymorphism identification of _H. avenae_
collected in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, 4
restriction enzymes applied to amplified DNA of
cysts from the Imbler field consistently revealed
a pattern identical to that of a _H. filipjevi_
DNA standard and distinct from patterns of _H.
avenae_, _H. schachtii_, and _H. latipons_.
Morphological evidence confirmed that the
specimens were _H. filipjevi_, a member of the
'_H. avenae_ Group'Â’ of cereal cyst nematodes.
Cysts were lemon shaped and light brown. As
described for _H. filipjevi_, cysts hatched much
more readily and at lower temperatures than
populations of _H. avenae_.

Detection of _H. filipjevi_ in Oregon represents
a new record for the occurrence of this species
in the United States and for North America. The
pathotype and resistance genes for incorporation
into wheat, barley, and oat are being identified.

[Black chaff and bacterial stripe of wheat are both caused by
_Xanthomonas campestris_ pv. _translucens_. The site and extent of the
symptoms depend on the strain of the bacterium, the affected cultivar,
and environmental conditions. Black chaff occurs primarily on the
glumes [ears], bacterial stripe primarily on the leaves and/or leaf
sheaths. The bacterium can be seed borne and persists on crop residues
in the soil, tolerating warm as well as freezing temperatures.

Cereal cyst nematode, _H. avenae_, can cause significant yield losses
on most cereal crops when populations are high. All wheat cultivars
are susceptible, but some do not support cyst formation. Other species
in the genus affect a range of different crops. Disease management for
cyst nematodes includes crop rotation and the use of partly resistant
cultivars to keep populations low. Elimination of cyst nematodes from
infected fields is usually not possible.
