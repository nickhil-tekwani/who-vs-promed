Freshway Foods is voluntarily recalling products containing romaine lettuce
with a use by date of 12 May 2010 or earlier because they have the
potential to be contaminated with _Escherichia coli_ O145. The products
were sold under the Freshway brand and Imperial Sysco brand. The company is
working with the FDA to inform consumers of this recall.

This recall includes romaine lettuce products sold by Freshway Foods for
food service outlets, wholesale, and in-store retail salad bars and delis;
no other products are involved. Freshway Foods does not produce bulk,
prepackaged romaine or bagged salad mixes containing romaine for sale in
supermarkets, and therefore these products are not included in this recall.

The recalled romaine lettuce products were sold to wholesalers and food
service outlets in the following states east of the Mississippi river:
Alabama, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New
Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. The recalled
romaine products were also sold for distribution to in-store salad bars and
delis for Kroger, Giant Eagle, Ingles Markets, and Marsh stores in the
states listed.

The recall comes after FDA informed Freshway Foods on Wed 5 May 2010, that
a previously unopened product sample in a New York state laboratory tested
positive for the bacterium.

[The contaminated lettuce found in NY has not yet been reported to be a
genetic match to the outbreak strain. Distribution to food service outlets
on or near them can explain the cases reported on college campuses.

It should be noted that if a laboratory is using sorbitol-MacConkey (sMAC)
plates to identify VTEC by virtue of O157's inability to ferment sorbitol,
the non-O157 strains will be missed unless Shiga toxin is directly tested
for. - Mod.LL]
