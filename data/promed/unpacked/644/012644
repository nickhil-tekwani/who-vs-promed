[1] Guinea: Ebola viral RNA in semen

A study of Ebola virus disease survivors in Guinea has added to previous evidence that the virus can persist for as long as 9 months in the semen of survivors, reinforcing the concern about a risk of sexual transmission for months after recovery.

An international team of researchers tested 98 semen samples from 68 Ebola survivors in Conakry and Macenta, Guinea, from March through October 2015, according to their 3 May 2016 report in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results for Ebola RNA were positive for 10 samples collected from 8 men up to 276 days (9 months) after their 1st symptoms.

The proportion of specimens that tested positive decreased over time, with positive results for 28.6% of specimens (4 of 14) obtained between 1 and 3 months after disease onset, 16.7% (3 of 18) collected at 4 to 6 months, and 6.5% (2 of 31) obtained at 7 to 9 months, the report says.

The researchers did not determine whether the samples contained infectious virus. "Semen probably does not remain infectious during the whole period, and viral isolation and sequencing will soon be performed ... to determine the infectivity of samples," they wrote.

In a study published in October 2015, Ebola RNA was found in the semen of 11 of 43 Ebola survivors who were tested between 7 and 9 months after their illness. And reports published in 2015 suggested that an Ebola case in a Liberian woman was probably caused by sexual transmission from her husband, an Ebola survivor.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that Ebola survivors abstain from sex or use condoms for up to 6 months after Ebola infection if semen testing is unavailable.

http://www.africanews.com/2016/05/05/ebola-virus-can-reside-in-a-survivor-s-semen-up-to-12-months-study-finds/. A new study conducted in Guinea confirms the Ebola virus (EBOV) may remain in a survivor's semen up to one year. The new report confirms the study conducted in October 2015 in Sierra Leone. Researchers believe that fragments of the virus could remain permanently in the body of survivors and pose a danger for their sexual contacts [those who had contact, intimate and otherwise, with the recovering EVD males]. The French and Guinean researchers who have followed the 450 healed patients have performed 98 levels of sperm testing on 68 men. The Ebola virus has been detected on 8 of them 9 months after they were healed. The researchers also noted that the persistence of the virus in the seminal fluid decreased with time.

According to researchers, the virus was present in 28.5 percent of samples collected between 1-3 months [following being declared free from EVD]. Between the 10th and the 12th month, it was estimated that 3.5 percent of the samples tested positive for Ebola virus before disappearing completely at the end of one year.

Prior to the outbreak, Ebola virus had only been detected in the semen of a few male survivors by cell culture (maximum duration 82 days after disease onset).

According to the Institute of Research for Development based in Guinea in collaboration with other agencies, these results "put the emphasis on the need to recommend, at the international level, the use of condoms by survivors in the months following their healing."

These 2 news items reference the same study. It appears rare that individuals [3.5% (1 of 29]) have detectable RNA up to one year in the semen, and 0% (0 of 6) beyond 12 months.

An earlier report on survivors in Sierra Leone found viral RNA up to 284 days (9 months) after onset of disease, with a decreasing trend in both in proportion of PCR-positive semen specimens and viral quantity over time [Deen GF et al. Ebola RNA persistence in semen of Ebola virus disease survivors--preliminary report. N Engl J Med 2015; doi:10.1056/ NEJMoa1511410]. This current report from Guinea adds further evidence of long-term persistence of viral RNA for up to 9 months among survivors, with the same decreasing trend over time. As in Sierra Leone, [the authors] cannot yet draw conclusions about the infectivity of the semen.

I recommend reading the commentary by Dr. Ian Crozier cited below which discusses the findings.

1 May 2016 Liberia: 2 Ebola patients released from ETU
http://gnnliberia.com/2016/05/01/liberia-two-ebola-patients-released-etu/
[The 2 Liberian children who contracted Ebola virus disease (EVD) from their mother and were taken by health authorities for exclusive treatment at the ELWA [Eternal Love Winning Africa]/MSF [Medecins Sans Frontieres] Ebola treatment unit [ETU] have survived.

According to the Deputy Minister of Health and Chief Medical Officer of Liberia Dr. Francis Kateh, the 5-year-old and 3-year-old boys who contracted the disease from their 30-year-old mother (who died from EVD at the Redemption Hospital, in the western Monrovia suburb of New Kru Town on 29 Mar 2016) were discharged from the ETU on Friday [29 Apr 2016].

Their mother is reported to have imported the disease from Guinea, where she contracted it from her husband, who also died of EVD.

Dr. Kateh said the 2 boys survived after being treated with Z-Mapp. He said all those who came in direct contact with the index case in the latest Ebola outbreak have completed the 21-day observation period without any confirmed case.]

2 May 2016: Potential Impact of Sexual Transmission on Ebola Virus Epidemiology: Sierra Leone as a Case Study

[Background:
Sexual transmission of Ebola virus disease (EVD) 6 months after onset of symptoms has been recently documented, and Ebola virus RNA has been detected in semen of survivors up to 9 months after onset of symptoms. As countries affected by the 2013-2015 epidemic in West Africa, by far the largest to date, are declared free of Ebola virus disease (EVD), it remains unclear what threat is posed by rare sexual transmission events that could arise from survivors.

Conclusion/Significance. Our results show that reductions in the per-sex-act transmission probability via abstinence and condom use should reduce the number of sporadic sexual transmission events, but will not significantly reduce the epidemic size and may only minimally shorten the length of time the public health community must maintain response preparedness. While the number of infectious survivors is expected to greatly decline over the coming months, our results show that transmission events may still be expected for quite some time as each event results in a new potential cluster of non-sexual transmission. Precise measurement of the convalescent period is thus important for planning ongoing surveillance efforts.]

(http://iiardpub.org/ijaes/get/Effect%20of%20Ebola%20Virus%20Disease.pdf)].

[Abstract.
Bush meat is a special delicacy of the Ibarapas, hence, a survey of the effects of Ebola Virus disease outbreak on consumption of bush meat in Ibarapa region of Oyo state was conducted. Questionnaires were randomly administered on 630 respondents in the 3 local governments in the region. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and likert rating scale. Findings revealed that outbreak of Ebola virus disease has implication on consumption of bush meat in the study area and has affected the livelihood of the marketer. Bush meats consumed in the area were also found to include squirrel, rodents, antelope, snake, alligator, bush fowl etc. Investigation revealed that consumption of animals such as bats and big rats were forbidden in some places in the studied area.

Also, choices of bush meat consumed were found to depend on availability, delicacy, price, nutrition and custom.

Respondents agreed that bush meat if not properly cooked can transmit not only EBOV but other diseases.

Respondent agreed that not all wild animals can transmit EBOV. The study therefore concluded that there should be adequate education on mode of transmission and prevention of EBOV by stakeholders, such as Health officer and extension workers.]

2016. Unique human immune signature of Ebola virus disease in Guinea

[Summary.
Despite the magnitude of the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa, there is still a fundamental lack of knowledge about the pathophysiology of EVD. In particular, very little is known about human immune responses to Ebola virus. Here we evaluate the physiology of the human T cell immune response in EVD patients at the time of admission to the Ebola Treatment Center in Guinea, and longitudinally until discharge or death. Through the use of multiparametric flow cytometry established by the European Mobile Laboratory in the field, we identify an immune signature that is unique in EVD fatalities. Fatal EVD was characterized by a high percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing the inhibitory molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1, which correlated with elevated inflammatory markers and high virus load. Conversely, surviving individuals showed significantly lower expression of CTLA-4 and PD-1 as well as lower inflammation, despite comparable overall T cell activation. Concomitant with virus clearance, survivors mounted a robust Ebola-virus-specific T cell response. Our findings suggest that dysregulation of the T cell response is a key component of EVD pathophysiology.]

5 May 2016: New study shows Ebola survivors may be at risk of severe vision loss
http://www.news-medical.net/news/20160505/New-study-shows-Ebola-survivors-may-be-at-risk-of-severe-vision-loss.aspx
[A new study has shown [Ebola virus disease (EVD)] survivors may be at risk of severe vision loss or blindness weeks after being declared virus-free. The research is being presented at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) this week in [USA, Washington State, Seattle].

Findings show about 1 in 5 Ebola survivors develops uveitis several weeks after being discharged from treatment centers, with 1/ 3 of those patients developing severe vision impairment or blindness. The results highlight the urgent need for eye care specialists and resources in the Ebola-survivor population.

Vaccine
------
3 May 2016: Ebola vaccine--Promising Phase I trials
http://medicalxpress.com/news/2016-05-ebola-vaccinepromising-phase-trials.html
[The clinical phase I trial of a potential vaccine against the dreaded Ebola virus has been successfully completed at 4 partner sites in Africa and Europe. The safety of the tested vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, which induces persistent antibodies against the virus, has been confirmed. The results are currently published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

"The results for tolerability, safety, and the immune response to the vaccine candidate are very promising," explains Prof Marylyn Addo. The antibodies which developed against the virus were still detectable after 6 months. Addo is convinced that "with this, a single vaccine could provide lasting protection against Ebola." The infectious disease specialist, who works for the German Center for Infection Research at the University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf (UKE) in Hamburg, led the trial in Hamburg. A total of 158 healthy adult volunteers were tested in Hamburg, as well as at the partner sites in Geneva (Switzerland), Lambaréné; (Gabon) and Kilifi (Kenya).

The scientists involved are participants in VEBCON, a consortium of experts founded by the WHO [World Health Organization], the goal of which is rapid and coordinated clinical testing of the Ebola vaccine in Africa. A vaccine is still urgently needed, since the current Ebola epidemic has not yet been completely defeated, and future outbreaks cannot be ruled out. ...more]
