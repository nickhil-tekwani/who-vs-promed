Planning to sell Ol' Paint? After September 1, Texas law will require
equine, including horses, donkeys, mules and asses, have a test for Equine
Infectious Anemia (EIA), (also known as "Coggins" or "Swamp Fever") within
12 months before the animals undergo any change of ownership. The law
exempts nursing foals changing ownership with their test-negative dams, and
equine sold to slaughter. Persons who sell equine and fail to comply with
the law, passed as House Bill 1732 in the 76th Texas Legislature, commit a
Class "C" misdemeanor.
"Buying test-negative animals will reduce the chance of taking home an
infected animal," said Dr. Terry Beals, executive director of the Texas
Animal Health Commission (TAHC), the state's livestock health regulatory
agency. "It's a real shame to buy an untested horse, get home, and find out
later that the animal is i nfected and has exposed your best horse to the
disease."
EIA is a viral disease spread from an infected equine to a 'clean' equine
by blood-to-blood contact. Biting flies can mechanically carry the disease
from one horse to another, and unsterilized medical instruments or blood
transfusions can also put equine at risk. (Mosquitoes are not capable of
spreading EIA.) Like some other viral diseases, EIA can strike as an acute
infection, in which the animal becomes very ill and dies. At the other
extreme are infected equine that show no signs of being ill, but test
positive for the disease. These equine pose a threat, as no one suspects
the animal has a health problem, even though it is a reservoir for disease.
"Our 12 governor-appointed commissioners have proposed regulations that
will bring us in line with the new change-of-ownership testing law and
clarify conditions for selling equine to slaughter without a test," said
Dr. Terry Beals.
"The commissioners have struggled with the question of the untested equine
moving through a market to slaughter," he said. "At this point, they are
against it. However, until their final vote is cast and regulations are
adopted, we recommend that markets require a test for all horses, even if
they are expected to be sold for slaughter. If, however, the markets elect
to sell untested equine to slaughter, the animals will be allowed to move
only to the plant under a restricted permit, known as a VS 1-27, issued by
a TAHC inspector or veterinarian."
"The commissioners will address the proposals and may adopt them as
regulations at their mid-September meeting in Austin. The law, however,
will be in effect September 1, requiring that the equine have an EIA test
within the past 12 months. The person transferring the ownership is
responsible for having the equine tested, whether the animal is traded or
sold at a public auction or private sale, or is just given away."
TAHC commissioners, each of which represent the public or a segment of the
livestock industry, have proposed the following:
* Foals that are nursing and are less than 8 months old would be exempt
from EIA testing, if they undergo change of ownership with their dam. The
mare, however, must have tested negative for EIA within the previous 12
months.
* Zebras would be exempt from the change-of-ownership testing rule.
* If an equine is not tested, it could be sold only direct to a slaughter
plant, where a blood sample would be collected for testing at state expense.
Testing for EIA is relatively simple. An accredited veterinarian must draw
the blood sample, complete the accompanying paperwork, and send the
specimen and document to one of the 60+ laboratories in Texas approved by
the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to conduct EIA tests. Results
generally take three to five days, if the specimens are handled by mail.
"After the USDA establishes guidelines, some horse markets may set up
'off-site' laboratories, to expedite EIA testing just prior to the sale,"
said Dr. Beals. "Thanks to new technology, test results can be available in
only a few hours. To prevent disappointment, sellers should call ahead
before hauling an untested horse to a market."
If an equine tests positive at the market lab, the owner may elect to have
the animal tested again. After a second blood sample is collected and sent
to the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory, the animal is to be
taken home, under a restricted movement permit, issued by a TAHC inspector.
While awaiting test results, the equine in question, and all other equine
on the premise of origin are to be quarantined.
"If the confirmation test is positive, this animal will be handled as any
infected equine, according to TAHC regulations," said Dr. Beals. He
explained that the animal would be permanently identified with the official
"74A" on the upper left shoulder, unless the animal is euthanized
immediately. Other equine on the premise would be considered as exposed to
the disease and would remain under quarantine until tested negative for the
disease at least 60 days after the infected animal is removed.
To help prevent the spread of disease, TAHC regulations require
EIA-infected equine to be euthanized, sold for slaughter or sent to a
research facility. If the animal must be kept, it is to remain permanently
quarantined at least 200 yards from other equine. In l998, 370 equine
tested positive for the disease in Texas.
"Infected equine will be allowed to move through the market to slaughter,
as they are permanently identified with the 74-A brand and are inspected
within 24 hours prior to entering the market," he said. As part of the
inspection, the TAHC or USDA-accredited veterinarian will ensure that the
animal has no clinical signs of the disease and has a normal temperature.
The animal will move under the VS 1-27 permit and must remain isolated
under a roof at the market, and remain on the premises no longer than 24
hours.
"Other aspects of the EIA regulations will not change," explained Dr.
Beals. A negative EIA test within the previous 12 months is required for
equine transported to events, races, trail rides, assemblies, or other
gatherings, where they will commingle with other equine. The EIA test
document, called a VS 10-11, is adequate proof of testing. Equine used
exclusively for ranch work are exempt from EIA tests, unless they are
undergoing change of ownership.
