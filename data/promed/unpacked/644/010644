Officials of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) Veterinary Services would like to clarify the posting "PRO/AH/EDR> Avian influenza (08): USA (IN) poultry, HPAI revised to LPAI H7N8, update," dated Sun 17 Jan 2016 and the moderator comments provided on the items.

The USDA has not revised or recanted the finding of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H7N8. The detection of H7N8 avian influenza in the index flock was a highly pathogenic strain. Subsequent surveillance around this index flock identified additional, low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H7N8 cases, which the USDA has also reported.

Ten cases have been reported. The 1st avian influenza detection in Dubois County, Indiana was of an H7N8 HPAI of North American lineage, based upon partial sequence data from the HA and NA genes. Of 9 additional cases detected during zone surveillance, 8 have been confirmed with LPAI H7N8 of North American lineage, again based upon partial sequence data from the HA and NA genes. The HPAI and LPAI partial sequences are nearly identical except for the insertion in the HA gene imparting the high pathogenicity for the HPAI virus. The remaining case is suspect by H7 PCR and is undergoing further analysis.

As the moderator indicated, North American LPAI from wild waterfowl can mutate to HPAI, generally as a result of replication in poultry.

As the moderator also indicated, this is not the same virus that caused the outbreaks in 2014-2015. Those viruses contained the Eurasian H5.

We hope this information will be helpful to your readers in understanding the current avian influenza situation in Indiana.

[We are very grateful for Dr Levings' clarification.

It seemed odd to me that the lab and a press release would make such a mistake. It was not clear from the release that this indeed was subsequent testing from around the original flock. - Mod.TG]

Highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI], United States of America
------------------------------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 15 Jan 2016 from Dr John Clifford, deputy administrator, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, USA

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 11 Jan 2016
Date of confirmation of the event: 15 Jan 2016
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 2015
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H7N8
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Dubois County, Dubois, Indiana
Date of start of the outbreak: 11 Jan 2016
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 43 500 / - / 900 / 42 600 / 0
Affected population: commercial turkey flock

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment
As part of existing avian influenza response plans, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), in conjunction with the Indiana State Board of Animal Health, are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation in the nearby area and have begun enhanced surveillance and testing in the area. State officials have quarantined the affected premises and implemented movement controls. Depopulation of birds on the premises is underway. The highly pathogenic H7N8 strain is of North America lineage.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country; quarantine; surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; stamping out; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; zoning; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: disinfection/disinfestations; official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste

Diagnostic test results:
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 15 Jan 2016 / Positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory) / Birds / virus sequencing / 15 Jan 2016 / Positive
National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) (national laboratory) / Birds / virus isolation / - / Pending

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This is the 1st reported case of HPAI in 2016 in the United States. However, unlike the recent AI event reported in 2015 which was caused by a Eurasian H5 strain (last detected in June of 2015), this event was caused by a North American H7 subtype. As already noted in posting 20160118.3944747, the animal health authorities have conducted enhanced surveillance around this index flock and have detected additional cases of the H7N8 subtype. The USDA reports that these additional cases of H7N8 are of low pathogenicity (see information at http://tinyurl.com/z4d4h4p). Although they are of low pathogenicity, the risk remains that these low pathogenic strains could mutate to HPAI (as occurred with the index flock), and, consequently, the US authorities are taking appropriate sanitary measures to prevent this from happening. - Mod.CRD
