China: New human case of bird flu confirmed
---------------------------------------------
China's Ministry of Health has confirmed a new human case of bird flu
in eastern Anhui Province, according to the Anhui Provincial Health
Department. A 16-year-old boy student in Bengbu City of Anhui
province died on Tuesday night [27 Mar 2007], a spokesman for the
health department said. The boy developed symptoms of fever, fear of
cold and muscle aches, and also demonstrations of pneumonia on 7 Mar
2007. He was sent to hospital on 18 Mar 2007, but a medical operation
failed to save his life, as his illness worsened quickly, the
spokesman said. Tests by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and
Prevention on Tuesday [27 Mar 2007] on the patient confirmed that he
had been infected with the bird flu virus strain H5N1.
Local health authorities said they are closely monitoring those who
had close contact with the patient. So far, they have showed no
symptoms of the disease, and there has been no bird flu epidemic
reported in Bengbu. According to Anhui health authorities, China's
Health Ministry has conveyed the information to the World Health
Organization, health agencies in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and some countries.
China has reported a total of 24 human cases of bird flu since 2003,
including 15 deaths. On 28 Feb 2007, a 44-year-old woman in east
China's Fujian Province was confirmed by the health ministry to have
contracted bird flu virus. The patient, who is still being treated in
hospital, had eaten chicken together with her family before the
infection, but her husband and son have not fallen ill.

China: Update on human bird flu death in Anhui
-----------------------------------------------
A teenage boy has died after falling ill with the bird flu virus,
Chinese state media reported on Thursday [29 Mar 2007], confirming
the country's 3rd case of human infection from the virus so far this
year [2007].
The 16-year-old student from Bengbu in eastern China's rural Anhui
province died late on Tuesday [27 Mar 2007], the Xinhua news agency
reported, citing a provincial health official. The boy was admitted
to hospital on 18 Mar 2007 after falling ill with a fever and signs
of pneumonia.
Tests by China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed
he had H5N1, which can spread from birds to humans through close
contact. But health authorities appeared to have little idea how the
boy came into contact with the virus. Initial investigations failed
to reveal that the boy had any "history of exposure to fowl that died
because of illness," Xinhua reported. Animal health experts have also
failed to find signs of the virus among birds in the area.
The World Health Organization has been notified of the death as has
Hong Kong and some other governments, the report said. China has now
reported a total of 24 human cases of H5N1, including 15 deaths,
since 2003. The virus has spread to more than 50 countries, raising
experts' fears it could mutate into a form that can easily pass from
person to person, risking a pandemic. China, with the world's largest
poultry population and millions of backyard birds roaming free, is
seen as key to the fight against bird flu.

Fujian, Hunan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Shanghai, Hubei, and Xinjiang
Uygur. A farmer in the eastern province of Anhui was diagnosed

Indonesia: Bird flu patient dies at Dr. Soetomo hospital, Surabaya
-----------------------------------------------
A 39-year-old bird flu patient at Dr. Soetomo Hospital here [died]
early Wednesday [28 Mar 2007] morning after having been treated for
several days. Hospital spokesman Dr. Teguh Sylvaranto said the woman,
a resident of Jetis village in Mojokerto district, East Java died of
H5N1 virus-induced liver and kidney failure. He said her body had
been handed to the family members for burial in Mojokerto.
According to Dr. Teguh Sylvaranto, she was the 2nd bird flu patient
who died at Dr. Soetomo Hospital, after the death of another patient,
also from Mojokerto, a week earlier. He pointed out that of 11 bird
flu suspects who had been treated in the hospital, 4 tested
H5N1-positive, and the remainder tested negative.
There are at least 81 confirmed human cases of bird flu in Indonesia,
with 64 of them fatal. Data from the World Health Organization (WHO)
said there were 274 confirmed human cases of avian influenza A virus
infection worldwide, 167 of whom were fatal. [As of 28 Mar 2007, the
WHO lists 284 human cases of avian H5N1 influenza and 169 deaths
worldwide and the total number of fatalities in Indonesia as 63.
Presumably, the East Java case described in this report may be the
64th fatality. - Mod.CP]
Meanwhile, Indonesia agreed on Tuesday [27 Mar 2007] to resume
sending bird flu samples to laboratories overseas after a 2-day
meeting on the issue organized by WHO. Health Minister Siti Fadillah
Supari was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying Indonesia expected a
guarantee that the samples would not be used to develop commercial
bird flu vaccines.
"We will resume sharing bird flu samples with the World Health
Organization immediately," the health minister said.
