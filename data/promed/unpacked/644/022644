In response to the [27 Sep 2014] ProMED request for information about possible neurological manifestations of enterovirus D68 [EV-D68] (Archive number 20140927.2809908), we would like to share the following information from the province of British Columbia (BC), Canada.

Among the 8 laboratory-confirmed cases of EV-D68 detected as of [30 Sep 2014] in BC, there were 2 individuals reported to the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) with paralytic symptoms, including a child aged 5-10 years and a young adult aged 15-20 years. Both are male, previously healthy and had symptom onset in late August 2014. They reside several hundred kilometres apart and are not epidemiologically linked. Unlike other areas affected by EV-D68, a general increase in severe respiratory illness visits to emergency rooms or hospitals has not yet been observed in BC. However, all public primary and secondary schools had been closed in BC due to a teacher's strike that recently ended and with school only having resumed from summer recess on [22 Sep 2014].

The younger child presented with a 5-day history of fever, cough, rhinorrhea and congestion. Household members, both adult and pediatric, had similar cold-like symptoms. Two days prior to admission, the child experienced headache and neck pain radiating to the left shoulder, worsened by coughing. The child developed sudden onset of left arm weakness. Examination at admission identified left arm flaccid paralysis and areflexia without any sensory findings. CSF examination showed elevated leukocytes consisting of a mix of neutrophils and lymphocytes with slight predominance of the latter, normal glucose and elevated protein (0.5 g/L). MRI identified asymmetric swelling from C2 to T1. Nerve conduction and EMG examination confirmed findings consistent with anterior horn cell involvement but normal sensory findings. CSF was negative for enterovirus RNA but the nasopharyngeal swab was PCR-positive for enterovirus/rhinovirus, subsequently confirmed to be EV-D68 by sequencing of the 5' UTR at the BCCDC. Serology was IgM positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae but nasopharyngeal swab was PCR-negative. There was no improvement in neurological symptoms during the 9-day course in hospital and the child was discharged with outpatient follow-up. There remains no neurological improvement nearly one-month post-admission.

The young adult had a prior history of shingles in the late spring and respiratory symptoms over the past 2-3 months. For the current episode, the patient awoke with right arm weakness and presented to hospital with one-day history of flu-like symptoms including mild fever, general aches and fatigue. No other family members had cold-like symptoms. The patient rapidly deteriorated over the ensuing 24 hours with difficulty breathing requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. CSF specimen showed elevated leukocytes consisting of a mix of neutrophils and lymphocytes with slight predominance of the former, normal glucose and elevated protein (0.63 g/L). CSF was negative for enterovirus and VZV, but tracheal aspirate was positive for enterovirus/rhinovirus, determined by sequencing to be EV-D68 at the BCCDC. MRI showed longitudinal high signal within the cervical cord. Nearly one month post-admission, the patient still requires assistance with ventilation.

The detection of EV-D68 from respiratory specimens in association with neurological findings does not prove causality particularly in the absence of virus detection in the CSF. It is possible that other etiologies were present and that the detection of EV-D68 was the result of contemporaneous viral shedding. In the current outbreak, EV-D68 has more often been reported in association with severe respiratory illness but neurologic findings in association with EV-D68 have also been reported previously elsewhere [1-3]. Most laboratories do not currently have the capacity to diagnose or characterize EV-D68 in order to systematically assess the extent of its circulation or the spectrum of its clinical involvement. Given the seriousness and prolonged duration of paralytic findings in these 2 recent cases of laboratory-confirmed EV-D68 in BC, we thought it was pertinent that we share this information. A comparison of EV-D68 gene sequences collected from patients across the 2014 outbreak in North America is also warranted and may help identify unique virus features associated with more severe complications, including possible neurologic manifestations.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Danuta Skowronski and colleagues for their rapid response to our RFI (request for information) on the reports of a polio-like illness possibly associated with infection with enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) and for sharing the details of these 2 patients. The above report submitted by them is the 1st official report describing clinical history, physical examination, supportive laboratory and MRI studies and epidemiologic studies conducted on cases matching the case definition provided by CDC: Patients less than or equal to 21 years of age with acute onset of focal limb weakness occurring on or after [1 Aug 2014]; and an MRI showing a spinal cord lesion largely restricted to grey matter. The absence of identification of the EV-D68 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) does not necessarily rule out etiology as recovery of poliovirus (another member of the enterovirus family) from CSF is not a frequent occurrence.

A disturbing mention in the above report is that primary and secondary schools opened late following the summer recess (on 22 Sep 2014), so that these early cases of neurologic disease were identified before the expected surge in cases of EV-D68 seen when children who may be shedding the virus are congregated in the school setting.
