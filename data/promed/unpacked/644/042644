A former slaughterhouse worker who was videotaped abusing ailing
cattle in a case that led to the largest beef recall in U.S. history
said in a jailhouse interview that he was only following orders. Luis
Sanchez said he felt bad when he saw how the cows were treated at
Chino-based Westland/Hallmark Meat Co., and insisted that his boss
taught him to use a forklift to move so-called downer cows along the
slaughter line. "That's how I was taught. He taught me to do the
work. I didn't know it was a serious crime," Sanchez told the San
Bernardino Sun in an interview published Friday [7 Mar 2008].

Sanchez, an illegal immigrant from Mexico, was being held at the
Adelanto Detention Center on immigration charges. He was charged with
animal cruelty in the slaughterhouse case, but he also faced charges
in 2 unrelated drug cases.

Sanchez's ex-boss, Daniel Ugarte Navarro, 49, has pleaded not guilty
to 5 felony counts of animal abuse and 3 misdemeanor counts of
illegal movement of a non-ambulatory animal. The counts carry a
maximum prison sentence of 5 years, 8 months, prosecutors have said.
Navarro will be assigned an attorney by the county public defender's
office at his 24 Mar 2008 arraignment.

Last month [February 2008], the Agriculture Department issued the
recall after the Humane Society of the United States released
undercover video of workers forcing sick and crippled cows to stand
with electric prods and forklifts. Sanchez appeared in the video
using an electric prod. Sanchez said he learned the company was
handling the cows differently than other slaughterhouses from truck
drivers who brought the animals to the plant. He said his supervisor
told the workers to use care when federal inspectors were around.
Sanchez, who 1st came to the slaughterhouse about 10 years ago, said
he doesn't understand why he's in jail. "I think it's unjust that I'm
here. Where are the people in charge?" he told the newspaper.

[In discussing this situation with a senior Louisiana Farm Bureau
colleague, he offered the opinion that the activities at the Chino
plant were probably common knowledge in local livestock sale barns in
and around Chino. The arrested slaughterhouse worker had been working
at the plant for 10 years and at some point was taught how to use a
forklift to move downers. Logically, he was not the 1st to be doing
this there, as someone (the "teacher") had already developed the
forklift skills with sufficient opportunities for the lift to be made
available.

USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has formally rescinded
Hallmark/Westland Meat Packing Co.'s supplier of the year award from
the 2004/2005 school year and requested they return the physical
award, which was a plaque. "The award was rescinded because of
evidence FSIS obtained that the establishment had the practice of
occasionally slaughtering cattle that, although the cattle passed
ante-mortem inspection, became non-ambulatory prior to entering the
slaughter operation," USDA spokeswoman Angela Harless told
Meatingplace.com.

Since 2000, AMS has not allowed non-ambulatory cattle to be processed
for sale as beef to AMS for distribution through USDA's Food and
Nutrition Service to programs like the school lunch program.

The plaque is probably the least of Hallmark's worries. CEO Steven
Mendell has been subpoenaed to appear before a House committee next
week to explain downer cow animal abuse at the Chino, California
plant that led to the largest beef recall in history.
