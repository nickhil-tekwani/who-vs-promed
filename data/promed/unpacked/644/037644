Cholera Reported in Merida
Fifteen cases of cholera (and two deaths) were reported by health
authorities in Merida. According to Rafael Gonzalez, president of the Merida
Health Corporation, the outbreak began approximately 3 months ago in the
southern zone of Lake Maracaibo [adjacent to the state of Merida.] It is
presumed that the origin of the current outbreak of cholera is related to
the consumption of contaminated fish that came from the state of Zulia
[where Lake Maracaibo lies.] Authorities of [the neighboring states] of
Tachira and Trujillo declared an epidemiological alert, and have started
campaigns of disease prevention and information of the communities that are
near the focal point of the disease. Likewise, the state of Merida has taken
measures to prevent the spread of the disease toward the region of the Andes
and other parts of the country.
