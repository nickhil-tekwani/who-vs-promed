A comment on SARS transmission
------------------------------
[The following comment from Dr Joseph Dudley relates to the New England
Journal of Medicine (NEJM) paper on SARS transmission at Amoy Gardens in
Hong Kong, reported in ProMED-mail post: "SARS - worldwide (17): China (HK
SAR), transmission." - Mod.CP]
I find it exceedingly interesting that so much effort and energy seems to
be focused on identifying exotic, rather than prosaic, mechanisms for the
transmission of SARS in Hong Kong and mainland China (the focus being on
raccoons, dogs, and palm civets rather than on commensal rats and domestic
cats in Guangzhou, or upon airflow engineering, and aerosolization
quotients instead of rat contamination and transmission)
<http://www1.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2004-01/05/content_295598.htm>.
As hypothesized by Stephen Ng,
<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/hot/sars/news/aug1503rats.html>,
the contamination of the ventilation system by feces and urine from a
single infected rat -- whose territory was located in the ventilation
shafts and in other areas of the upper floors of the building in question
-- would appear to be an equally effective and efficient -- if not nearly
as elegant or complex -- mechanism for the spread of the 2003 SARS outbreak
at the Amoy Gardens complex in Hong Kong as that proposed by Yu and
colleagues in their NEJM paper
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/350/17/1731>.
The Hong Kong government appears to have invested a considerable amount of
effort and resources into refuting Ng's idea that rats might have been
involved in the etiology of the 2003 SARS outbreak in the Amoy Gardens
complex. See press release at
<http://www.info.gov.hk/gia/general/200402/28/0228205.htm>.
Nonetheless, I submit that Occam's Razor might well be an appropriate tool
for cutting through much of the current confusion and obfuscation on this
issue, although the implications which follow therefrom -- that urban rats
and cats may be serving as reservoirs and vectors for the SARS virus in
Hong Kong -- and/or mainland China -- are extremely unsettling and,
perhaps, even frightening in terms of their long-term epidemiological and
public health significance <http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=58133>

[Dr Dudley has added the following further comment in response to an
observation by a ProMED-mail moderator (MPP) that a more generalized
spread, nearly impossible to interrupt, might be seen if a large number of
freely roaming animals were involved in transmission. - Mod.CP]
Although SARS obviously didn't originate in rats, the current evidence
seems to indicate that what we are witnessing and tracking at this time is
a significant evolutionary event involving the process of the tentative
early stages of the establishment ["adaptation"] of a newly-mutated viral
pathogen (the SARS coronavirus) in a new stable reservoir host (rats, cats,
humans, etc.).
If we are fortunate, the SARS virus, in its current form, may not be able
to establish itself as a self-sustaining zoonotic pathogen within rat
populations, and the disease may only occur in rats as a transient and
dead-end secondary host (in which case, the closing of wildlife street
markets -- for raccoons, dogs, palm civets, etc. -- could successfully
prevent subsequent outbreaks). The current data do suggest that this may in
fact be the case at present.
It cannot be ruled out that the hypothesized role of rats in the Amoy
Gardens outbreak could have involved mechanical transmission rather than
urine/fecal contamination (as might have occurred had a rat crawled/swam
out of a SARS-contaminated toilet and then tried -- successfully or
unsuccessfully -- to exit the toilet room by means of the ventilation fan
opening or by means of a ventilation shaft).
It seems possible, however, that if the intensive rat-eradication efforts
undertaken at the sites in Guangzhou or Hong Kong, where SARS outbreaks
occurred, were, in fact, successful, or nearly so, we could still have a
possibility of latent SARS infections circulating in such a very small
number of individual rats that we would not expect the disease to have
revealed its presence in urban rat populations at this early date; at least
until the next time there is a recurrence of the reported scenario in
Guangzhou this year, in which several rats infected with SARS were trapped
in an apartment of an isolated SARS victim who has no known contacts with
any of the suspected wildlife hosts for the SARS virus
<http://www1.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2004-01/05/content_295598.htm>.
For all of these reasons, it is extremely important for any and all
potential SARS reservoirs and transmission mechanisms to be thoroughly, and
exhaustively, investigated. We must also recognize that what is true for
the SARS virus today may not necessarily be true tomorrow, as demonstrated
over the past year with the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. Demonstration
of past recombination events in the SARS-CoV lineage indicates this virus
has a clear potential for rapid unpredictable change that makes this
pathogen an extremely challenging adversary for drug and vaccine
development well as for public health management (Rest & Mindell 2003).
