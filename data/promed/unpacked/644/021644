Scientists in Ohio are reporting a long-awaited advance toward making
the workplace safer for more than one million machinists in the
United States who may be exposed to disease-causing bacteria in
contaminated metalworking fluids. Those fluids become airborne during
machining of metal parts.

In the report, Jagjit S. Yadav and colleagues (1) note that a
bacterium called _Mycobacterium immunogenum_ was 1st identified in
2000 as the potential cause of a mysterious disease that had been
occurring among machinists. The illness, called hypersensitivity
pneumonitis (HP), is an inflammation of the lung resulting from the
body's immune reaction to bacteria, mold, and other airborne particles.

At HP outbreak sites, _M. immunogenum_ is known to colonize
metalworking fluids, used to cool the cutting tools that grind
metals. Workers inhale the infectious particles as they spray into
the air from drills and other cutting tools. HP's symptoms include
fever, cough, shortness of breath and chills. The scientists describe
their first-of-its-kind identification of 33 proteins in _M.
immunogenum_ that seem to be involved in triggering the immune
response likely responsible for HP. Those proteins could serve as the
basis for a test to identify workplace contamination with _M.
immunogenum_ and targets for developing medications or vaccines to
treat and prevent the condition, the study says.

[_M. immunogenum_ is a member of the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group,
but appears to differ from other members of this group by subtle
mutations in rpoB, hsp65, the hypervariable region of 16S rRNA and
other housekeeping genes. The _Mycobacterium chelonae-abscessus_
group are non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) (that is, a grouping
outside of the _M. tuberculosis_ complex). The _ M.
chelonae-abscessus_ group are rapidly growing NTM species (RGM) that
produce mature growth on agar plates within 7 days of incubation.
Non-pigmented RGM are grouped within the _M. fortuitum_ complex and
include _M. fortuitum_ and the _M. chelonae-abscessus_ group. The
intermediately growing NTM include _M. marinum_ and _M. gordonae_,
are pigmented, and require 7-10 days to produce mature growth on agar
plates. Slowly growing NTM include _M. kansasii_ and _M.
avium/intracellulare_ complex and require more than 7 days to produce
mature growth on agar plates.

Nosocomial outbreaks of infections due to non-pigmented RGM species
are generally related to use of contaminated water or fluid skin
markers in cosmetic plastic surgery (Safranek TJ, et al.
_Mycobacterium chelonae_ wound infections after plastic surgery
employing contaminated gentian violet skin-marking solution. N Engl J
Med 1987; 317: 197-201; abstract available at
<http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/317/4/197>)
and to implanted devices and injection sites.

Not only has _M. immunogenum_ been identified as the potential cause
of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in industrial metal-grinding
machinists (see Wilson RW, et al. _Mycobacterium immunogenum_ sp.
nov., a novel species related to _Mycobacterium abscessus_ and
associated with clinical disease, pseudo-outbreaks, and contaminated
metalworking fluids: an international cooperative study on
mycobacterial taxonomy. Int J Syst Evol Microbiol. 2001;51:1751-64,
and Wallace RJ Jr, et al. Presence of a single genotype of the newly
described species _Mycobacterium immunogenum_ in industrial
metalworking fluids associated with hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
Appl Environ Microbiol. 2002;68:5580-4), this microorganism has been
reported to cause health-care associated infections and outbreaks
originating from use of contaminated injectable solutions or skin
antiseptics during invasive cosmetic procedures in Argentina (del
Castillo M. et al. Mesotherapy-associated outbreak caused by
_Mycobacterium immunogenum_ [letter]. Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the
Internet]. 2009 Feb [date cited]. Available from
<http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/15/2/357.htm>).
_M. immunogenum_ has also been isolated from corneal scrapings in 4
patients who developed infectious keratitis after surgical correction
of myopia in Sao Paulo, Brazil (JLM Sampaio et al. J Clin Microbiol
2006; 44:3201-7. Available at:
<http://jcm.asm.org/cgi/content/full/44/9/3201>).

_M. immunogenum_ has also been cultured from a biopsy specimen of a
chronic leg ulcer that developed in a 55-year-old man from the
Netherlands after he returned from traveling in Guatemala and Belize
