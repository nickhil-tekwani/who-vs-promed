A woman from the Central Anatolian province of Sivas died on Thursday
[8 May 2008] at an Ankara hospital where she was being treated for
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a viral disease contracted from a
tick bite which can be fatal.

The woman, who herself had removed the tick that bit her 10 days ago
as she grazed her cattle, died on Thursday [8 May 2008] at Ankara
Numune Hospital, where she had been transferred from a Karabuk
provincial hospital that she initially checked into after falling ill
a few days after the bite. She was buried in her home district of
Eflani in Karabuk. She is survived by her 2 children.

Meanwhile, in the Central Anatolian city of Sivas, 10 children with
tick bites were taken to the Sivas State Hospital in the past 2 days.
The ticks on the children's bodies were removed by medical staff at
the hospital. One of the children's tick bites was noticed by the
child's teacher, who immediately notified the parents. Their
hospitalization follows that of 6 other children, also taken to the
hospital in Sivas on Wednesday [7 May 2008] with symptoms of
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.

Officials at the Sivas State Hospital repeated their warning against
trying to remove a tick from the body oneself, advising instead that
people go to the nearest hospital or clinic for medical staff to
remove the tick.

In the past 5 years, 94 people have died in Turkey of Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever. People who have come into contact with a tick
should be monitored for 10 days following contact and seek
professional medical care if symptoms of fever, headache, nausea,
vomiting or diarrhea present themselves.

Turkish Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Foundation
(KLIMIK) President Haluk Eraksoy pointed out that ticks become active
in spring and summer, so necessary measures should be taken now.
Eraksoy said we must learn to live with ticks, accepting them as a
reality of life in this geography.

"This is the most active period for ticks. As we cannot completely
eradicate ticks, we must take preventive measures at once. They
multiply in spring, and this increases the possibility of their
contact with human beings. We expect this to continue also in summer," he said.

As to the reason why tick bite cases have surged in recent years,
Eraksoy said: "Some put the blame on global warming or environmental
pollution. Some suggest that the ticks are carried by migratory birds
to Turkey. Yet, there is no generally accepted explanation for its
origins." He indicated that in regions where tick bite cases are
frequent, doctors should be briefed about the illness and that people
engaged in animal breeding should be trained about how to safeguard
against ticks, such as wearing apparel that will not allow ticks to
attach to the body.

Eraksoy noted that Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is known under
different names around the world and that it is hosted by arthropods
such as ticks. He stated that they are planning to organize an
international conference in Istanbul in June [2008] in cooperation
with the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious
Diseases to discuss all viral hemorrhagic fever diseases. "This will
be a great opportunity to exchange experiences on this subject. This
is a first of its kind. Many authorities in the field will attend the
conference from the US, the EU, Iran, Nigeria and South Africa," he said.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is caused by infection with a
tick-borne virus classified in the genus _Nairovirus_ of the family
_Bunyaviridae_. CCHF virus is found in Eastern Europe, particularly
in the former Soviet Union. It is also distributed throughout the
Mediterranean, in northwestern China, central Asia, southern Europe,
Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. In fact, its
range coincides with that of its tick vector.

Ixodid (hard) ticks, especially those of the genus, _Hyalomma_, are
both a reservoir and a vector for the CCHF virus. A representation of
a _Hyalomma_ tick can be found either at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvrd/Spb/mnpages/dispages/cchf.htm>, or by
accessing the press report at the URL above. Numerous wild and
domestic animals, such as cattle, goats, sheep and hares, serve as
amplifying hosts for the virus. Transmission to humans occurs through
contact with infected animal blood or ticks. CCHF can be transmitted
from one infected human to another by contact with infectious blood
or body fluids. Nosocomial spread of CCHF has also occurred in
hospitals due to improper sterilization of medical equipment, reuse
of injection needles, and contamination of medical supplies.

Immature _Hyalomma_ ticks (nymphs and larvae) feed on small mammals
and birds and adults ticks on the larger mammals and livestock as
well as birds. Infected ticks become carriers of the virus and can
pass on the virus to the next generation of ticks as well as to
mammals, birds and humans when the ticks seek a blood meal.
Fortunately, ticks prefer feeding on animals and birds rather than on humans.
