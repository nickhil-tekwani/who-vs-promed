The Associate Diagnostic Knowledge Base for Infectious and Parasitic
Diseases of Man indicates that the encephalopathy occurring in the two
children in the Congo is most likely due to an enterovirus which has
disseminated to the brain.

Both children had received aspirin. Could these be cases of Reye syndrome?

Is it possible that these two unfortunate cases are suffering from an
extreme enteroviral infection, either Coxsackie ( A or B?), or enterovirus
type 70/71? They both had GI symptoms, both exhibited encephalopathy, CNS
symptoms such as hypertonia and hypereflexia, and coma.
The second case also exhibited pulmonary and cardiac problems, as well as a
mild hepatosplenomegaly. They would fit a susceptible age group.
The only other similarities in these two cases are the use of aspirin
precipitating the onset of coma - Reye's Syndrome?

Having read the piece on the Vanga hospital paediatric cases I couldn't
help but thinking of Reye's syndrome as a provisional diagnosis. Perhaps
[the attending physicians] can [post mortem] or viscerotome (liver) the
first case for fatty changes. Local doctors, healers and general public
should be warned about haphazard use of aspirin in febrile children. Will
be most interested to know of progress on these cases.
