State health officials are warning of a growing outbreak of salmonellosis in Michigan. Since the beginning of March 2016, there have been 20 cases of salmonellosis in Michigan directly tied to people handling baby chicks and ducklings. 6 people ended up in the hospital.

"While raising baby chicks and having fresh eggs can be fun and educational, poultry owners should be aware that chickens and other birds can carry germs that can impact human health," said Dr Eden Wells, Michigan Department of Health and Human Services chief medical executive.

Some of the cases have been linked to feed and farm stores where people purchased baby poultry. "Live baby poultry can carry _Salmonella_ and still look healthy. Poultry do not get sick like people do from this bacterium," said Dr James Averill, state veterinarian, Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

State officials expect the number of cases will rise.

[Information from the State of Michigan reported that the predominant serotype was _S._ Enteritidis but other serotypes have been observed as well.

Small animals such as chicks, ducklings, mice, and baby turtles are common vehicles for salmonellosis for 2 reasons: they are small enough to handle and they carry salmonellae. 2 ways to minimize the risk: aggressive hand washing after contact and choosing other pets such as dogs or cats. - Mod.LL
