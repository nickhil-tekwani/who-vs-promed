Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: On 18 Dec 2010, the Official Veterinary Services (OVS) were informed by the owner of a holding in the municipality of Sertanopolis (State of Parana) on a recumbent bovine showing limb stiffness which was detected during routine inspection. Next day, when the OVS were going to visit the holding, they were informed by the stockman that the animal was dead.

The OVS went to the holding to collect information and samples for the diagnosis of the cause of the death. As it is an area where rabies is present in herbivores, samples were taken for the diagnosis of this disease and for differential diagnosis, as recommended by the national protocol. The animal was properly buried on site. The animal was a beef breeding cow almost 13 years old at the time of death, according to information obtained during the epidemiological investigations.

According to regulations and routine procedures to be implemented in case of suspected neurological diseases, the sample was tested for rabies and it was negative. As it was an adult animal negative for rabies, the sample was sent for laboratory analysis within the surveillance system for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).

On 11 Apr 2011, a negative histopathological result for BSE was obtained in a laboratory accredited by the OVS. The sample was sent to the National Reference Laboratory, National Agricultural Laboratory (LANAGRO-PE), Recife, Pernambuco, for BSE diagnosis and it tested positive on 15 Jun 2012 by immunohistochemical test.

The delay between the 2 tests was caused by an incident occurred in one of the laboratories of the accredited network for the diagnosis of BSE. That led to overload the system and to prioritize the diagnosis of samples which met BSE-risk characteristics, as established by the OIE. The sample belonged to the group "fallen stock" and to the age group "over 9 years," according to the Article 11.5.22 of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code. This classification led to consider the sample as showing a low diagnosis priority level, which resulted in a longer than expected delay from histopathological to immunohistochemical tests.

According to the procedure manual on response to the occurrence of a BSE event in Brazil and as it is the 1st occurrence in the country, the sample was sent for confirmatory diagnosis to the OIE Reference Laboratory for this disease, Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA), Weybridge, United Kingdom. The sample tested positive in immunohistochemical test on 6 Dec 2012.

The epidemiological investigation shows that the animal's death was not caused by BSE and suggests that it may be an atypical case of the disease occurring in the oldest animals. Information collected during the epidemiological investigation shows also that the animal was reared in an extensive system on grazing.

Note by the OIE: Brazil is still recognized by the OIE as having a negligible BSE risk in accordance with Chapter 11.5. of the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code.

[This is the 1st report of BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) in Brazil. While the OIE regards Brazil as a negligible risk, there are some countries who may view this differently, especially as they look at meat that may be exported.

The determination of this case as a sporadic case may take some investigation or analysis. Without such an analysis to prove this was a sporadic case, there is a large shadow of doubt that may creep over countries importing product from Brazil.

Other countries and likely the OIE will be looking to see what type of surveillance program Brazil may put into effect. With an eye toward the export markets, Brazil will likely analyze the situation and put into place a surveillance mechanism and a thorough investigation of the situation.
