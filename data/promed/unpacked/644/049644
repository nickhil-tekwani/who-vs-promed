Measles outbreak kills 110 in Zambia
------------------------------------
An outbreak of measles in Zambia has affected more than 6200 people
and claimed at least 110 lives, the Zambian Health Ministry has
reported. Currently, the total number of people affected by the
disease in the country stands at 6252, Ministry of Health
spokesperson Kamoto Mbewe was quoted as saying by the Zanis news
agency Thu 5 Aug 2010. Mbewe said the capital city of Lusaka was the
worst hit with 106 deaths recorded out of 4928 cases, according to a
Xinhua [news agency] report.

Mbewe asked the people not to panic as the Ministry is doing
everything possible to address the issue and that an immunisation
programme was on in full swing.

[On Fri 9 Jul 2010 the Zambian Ministry of Health reported
approximately 3000 cases of measles and 62 deaths. At that time [8
Jul 2010] speaking to journalists in Lusaka, Dr Mwaba said there were
still sporadic cases of measles in the country, though the situation
was being contained. 4 weeks later with 6252 cases and 110 deaths
this has proved to have been an over-optimistic statement.

Most of the cases (79 percent) and most of the deaths (96 percent)
have occurred in the capital Lusaka contradicting the assertion that
the scale of the outbreak is partly a consequence of inability to
reach outlying districts with vaccine due to flooding. It would
appear that the outbreak is still far from resolved.

Lusaka is located in the east of Zambia. The HealthMap/ProMED-mail
