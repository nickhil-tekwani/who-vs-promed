Tuberculosis, an infectious disease that is transmitted by coughing, is the leading cause of death attributable to a single pathogen. In China, which has the 2nd highest number of tuberculosis cases in the world, massive rural-to-urban population shifts over the past 15 years have coincided with large increases of the disease in cities. These recent increases have typically been attributed to the importation of tuberculosis by migrants traveling from rural settings where the incidence of tuberculosis infection and disease have been historically higher than in urban settings.

An international team of scientists, led by Chongguang Yang, Ph.D., a postdoctoral associate at the Yale School of Public Health, studied the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis over 7 years in Songjiang, a district of Shanghai that has experienced influxes of rural migrants and subsequent increases in the local burden of tuberculosis. The findings are published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases.

By combining spatial, pathogen genomic and epidemiological data from tuberculosis cases, the research team determined that more than 2-3rds of migrants who harbored bacteria found to be within genetic clusters were likely infected after their arrival in Songjiang and that source cases who were born in Songjiang were as likely to infect migrants as migrants were to infect residents. Importantly, none of the probable transmission links between migrants and residents were uncovered through standard [contact] tracing investigations, highlighting the importance of genomic analysis to trace transmission of this respiratory pathogen.

This suggests the need for new interventions that not only improve screening and case finding among new migrants, but also help to interrupt transmission occurring within cities."

"Our analysis suggests that increasing tuberculosis notification in Songjiang was not only due to importation of disease from rural areas, but also attributable to local transmission chains involving both migrants and residents," said Yang. "This suggests the need for new interventions that not only improve screening and case finding among new migrants, but also help to interrupt transmission occurring within cities."

This research provides a clear example of how leading-edge approaches for combining pathogen genomic and spatial data with more traditional questionnaire-based public health investigations can provide important, actionable insights for public health practitioners, said Ted Cohen an associate professor at Yale School of Public Health and co-senior author of the study. "In this case, the complex patterns of local transmission in Songjiang occurring between and amongst residents and migrants would not have been understood without all of these data."

The research has important implications for other cities in eastern China, such as Beijing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, where rural to urban migration is also common and tuberculosis notifications are increasing. Interventions that can improve access to timely diagnosis and care for migrants, who often must contend with administrative and socioeconomic barriers to medical care and experience challenging living and working conditions within cities, can help to mitigate the risk of transmission within cities and protect both migrants and residents.

Summary
-------
Background
----------
"Massive internal migration from rural to urban areas poses new challenges for tuberculosis control in China. We aimed to combine genomic, spatial, and epidemiological data to describe the dynamics of tuberculosis in an urban setting with large numbers of migrants.

Methods
-------
"We did a population-based study of culture-positive _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ isolates in Songjiang, Shanghai. We used whole-genome sequencing to discriminate apparent genetic clusters of _M. tuberculosis_ sharing identical variable-number-tandem-repeat (VNTR) patterns, and analysed the relations between proximity of residence and the risk of genomically clustered _M. tuberculosis_. Finally, we used genomic, spatial, and epidemiological data to estimate time of infection and transmission links among migrants and residents.

Findings
--------
"Between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2015, 1620 cases of culture-positive tuberculosis were recorded, 1211 (75 percent) of which occurred among internal migrants. 150 (69 percent) of 218 people sharing identical VNTR patterns had isolates within 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of at least one other strain, consistent with recent transmission of _M. tuberculosis_. Pairs of strains collected from individuals living in close proximity were more likely to be genetically similar than those from individuals who lived far away--for every additional km of distance between patients' homes, the odds that genotypically matched strains were within ten SNPs of each other decreased by about 10 percent (OR 0·89 [95 percent CI 0·87-0·91]; p<0·0001). We inferred that transmission from residents to migrants occurs as commonly as transmission from migrants to residents, and we estimated that more than 2-3rds of migrants in genomic clusters were infected locally after migration.

Interpretation
--------------
"The primary mechanism driving local incidence of tuberculosis in urban centres is local transmission between both migrants and residents. Combined analysis of epidemiological, genomic, and spatial data contributes to a richer understanding of local transmission dynamics and should inform the design of more effective interventions."

ProMED-mail previously reported a study by Yang and colleagues that used genotyping of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) isolates collected from patients in Shanghai to establish transmission patterns (Tuberculosis, MDR - China: (Shanghai) primary, neighborhood outbreaks, 2009-2012 20161216.4702532). Although transmission of tuberculosis is thought to usually require close, repeated or prolonged contact with a contagious individual in a poorly ventilated environment, such as households or homeless shelters, Yang et al found that genomically clustered cases did not have anything in common other than living in the same neighborhood or using the same public facilities such as food markets. Only a small number of cases were traced to household contacts.

This Shanghai MDR-TB outbreak was similar to a MDR-TB outbreak in Singapore, where a neighborhood outbreak was linked to use of cybercafes at a shopping mall (ProMED-mail Tuberculosis, MDR - Singapore (03): (AMK) linked to 2012 cybercafé outbreak 20160622.4302632).

In the present study reported above of culture-positive tuberculosis in Songjiang, a district adjacent to downtown Shanghai, Yang and colleagues used combined analysis of epidemiological, genomic, and spatial data to disclose transmission links among migrants and residents. They reported that more than 2-3rds of migrants in genomic clusters were infected locally after migration and that source cases who were born in Songjiang were as likely to infect migrants as migrants were to infect residents.
