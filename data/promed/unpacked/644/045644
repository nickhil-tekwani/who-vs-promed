Whale expected to wash ashore today in Ventura County, the 2nd there in a week
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another dead blue whale was floating toward shore Thursday [20 Sep 2007] in
the Santa Barbara Channel, as puzzled experts try to determine why at least
3 of the huge mammals have died off the Southern California coast in less
than 2 weeks.
Tracked by government aircraft, the 60 foot (18 metres) blue whale -- a
member of the largest species on Earth -- was drifting toward the Ventura
County coast and was expected to wash ashore sometime today. Scientists
said they didn't know where it would land. Last week [10-14 Sep 20-07], a
dead blue whale beached about 10 miles up the coast from Ventura and
another was found in Long Beach Harbor before being towed out to sea.
Joe Cordaro, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said he couldn't recall a similar spate of blue whale deaths off
California or anywhere else. "There's something a little different going on
right now," he said, "and we don't know what it is."
The latest blue whale was spotted Wednesday afternoon [19 Sep 2007] by
Derek Lee, a vacationing marine biologist who was sailing to Channel
Islands Harbor in Oxnard after a few days off Santa Cruz Island. "We got 50
feet away from it, took pictures and rounded it twice," said Lee, who works
in Northern California's Farallon National Wildlife Refuge. "It was
floating belly up, freshly dead and intact."
Lee phoned Cordaro, who alerted scientists in the region's Marine Mammal
Stranding Network, a group of experts from marine institutes, government
agencies and the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. After the whale
beaches today, biologists will begin the elaborate process of determining a
cause of death. The whale that washed ashore last week had numerous broken
bones, suggesting it was hit by a ship in one of the Santa Barbara
Channel's busy shipping lanes.

[Although one of these delightful creatures may have been hit by a ship, it
is unlikely that all 3 suffered the same fate. Just as we have had some
rather unusual weather patterns on land this year, that likely also affects
the oceans.
It seems unlikely the cause of the problem would be domoic acid or toxic
algaes since we currently have no reports of other species being affected.
And without more information it is difficult to speculate.
We hope there will be more informative information when the necropsy and
testing have been completed.
