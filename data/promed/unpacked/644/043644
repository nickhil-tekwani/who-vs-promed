A health official said Thursday [20 Nov 2008], 3 Zimbabweans have
died of cholera in neighboring South Africa, where dozens of people
have come in search of treatment after an outbreak back home.

So far 3 Zimbabwean patients have died since Saturday [15 Nov 2008].
The latest casualty was recorded Wednesday evening [19 Nov 2008],
said Phuti Selobi, spokesman for the health department in the border
town of Musina.

South Africa has identified a total of 72 cholera cases. All but 2 of
them are Zimbabweans, Selobi said.

Zimbabwe is grappling with a cholera outbreak that has killed 73
people in recent weeks, about half of them in the town of Beitbridge,
just across the border from South Africa, according to state media in Harare.

South African health officials have stepped up their efforts to check
for the disease on the border, amid signs the disease is reaching
deeper into the country, Selobi said.

A truck driver who arrived from Zimbabwe has been diagnosed with
cholera, the KwaZulu-Natal health department said on Wednesday [19
Nov 2008]. Spokesperson Leon Mbangwa said that the man had been
placed in an isolation ward in Durban's Addington Hospital. He said
the man had left Zimbabwe last Thursday [13 Nov 2008] with his
brother and arrived in Durban on Saturday morning [15 Nov 2008].

The truck driver and his brother checked into a local Durban lodge on
that morning. By evening the man was vomiting and suffering from
diarrhea. He was first admitted to City Hospital before being
transferred to Addington Hospital.

"He was in a semi-coma condition at that time, so it was hard to get
information from him. It has emerged that where he was in Zimbabwe
where people were suffering from diarrhea," said Mbangwa. He said
that tests had confirmed that the man had cholera. His brother was
under observation.

Poor sanitary facilities, intermittent water supplies and poor refuse
management have led to a cholera outbreak in Masvingo. Although no
deaths have been officially recorded to date, sources spoken to by
RadioVOP indicated that about 5 people have already died due to
cholera and related illnesses. More than 450 cases of cholera have
been recorded in health centres in the province since Friday [14 Nov 2008].

The most affected areas are Rujeko suburbs, Mushandike, and
Mpandawana Growth point in Gutu and Chivi district. Health officers
were on Monday [17 Nov 2008] deployed at Mushandike Resettlement area
where they are said to be treating the victims.

Medical staff at Masvingo General Hospital who spoke on condition of
anonymity said a number of people were being ferried to the
Provincial hospital for cholera treatment.

An official at Rujeko clinic said more than 200 cases of cholera were
recorded since Thursday last week [13 Nov 2008].

At least 26 people are suffering from cholera in the Kinkakassa
Village, in the southern Congolese Pool District, a source close to
the World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Office for Africa told
PANA here on Wednesday [19 Nov 2008]. The outbreak was first reported
about 2 weeks ago, but no deaths from the disease have so far been reported.

Cholera was diagnosed in Kinkakassa following a dramatic surge of
diarrhea cases in the area. Samples taken by NGO Medecins d'Afrique,
which is working under a socioeconomic rehabilitation and development
project funded by the European Union, were forwarded for analysis to
the Brazzaville national public health laboratory, where the
diagnosis of cholera was confirmed.

[8] Cholera - Guinea-Bissau
Date: 19 Nov 2008

(IRIN) report [edited]
<http://allafrica.com/stories/200811190981.html>


After more than 6 months of battling cholera in Guinea-Bissau the
epidemic is now easing health officials say, though they admit they
have not identified its root causes or put in place measures to
prevent future outbreaks.

Thus far, 221 people have died and 13 921 have been infected,
according to the Ministry of Health.

"All the factors that cause cholera remain unaddressed: poverty,
deficient sanitary services, lack of drinking water," Umaro Ba, head
of the cholera unit at the capital Bissau's Simao Mendes hospital,
told IRIN. "And more importantly in the future we need to put in
place a strong prevention programme."

At the epidemic's peak in the final week of September 2008, 1376 new
cholera cases were registered and 19 people died, according to the
ministry of health, but from 9 to 16 Nov 2008 just 128 new cases and
no deaths were reported.

A decrease in cholera cases is partly due to the end of the rainy
season, according to Ba, as the disease is spread by bacteria in
contaminated water.

The strong mobilization from UN agencies, communities, local and
international NGOs, and donors also helped contain the disease,
according to Johannes Mooij, technical adviser at the Simao Mendes hospital.

Health Ministry officials say cholera broke out in May 2008 in the
southern region of Tombali, but they still do not know how it spread
to the capital, home to the highest number of victims. Nor do
epidemiologists understand why the isolated Bijagos Islands had the
highest per capita caseload.

At least 100 people have died in the past 4 weeks after an outbreak
of acute watery diarrhea (AWD) in and around the town of Abudwaaq, in
Galgadud region of central Somalia, medical sources said on 18 Nov 2008.

"Since 3 Oct 2008, 100 people have died in Abudwaaq town; there are
some people who have died in the villages around it but we don't have
numbers for them," said Mohamed Jama, the only doctor in the area.
"This is the highest mortality rate I have witnessed in my career."

Jama said that so far 500 cases of AWD had been registered in the
hospital, where a treatment centre was set up. "These are the ones
who made it here. We are getting reports of people dying in the
outlying villages, but unfortunately we cannot reach them."

He blamed the outbreak on contaminated water drawn from wells and
"barkads" (water catchments).

At least 2 people have died and more than 1500 are hospitalized
following a suspected outbreak of cholera in the southern
Philippines, health officials said Wednesday [19 Nov 2008].

National Epidemiology Centre chief Eric Tayag said the patients "were
showing cholera symptoms" and most came from the settlement of
Tagoloan in southern Misamis Oriental, where heavy rains has caused
minor flooding which could have contaminated the drinking water supply.

A Red Cross official in Manila told AFP the charity's chapter in
Misamis Oriental had confirmed that 2 people had died and that 9 out
of the 10 villages in Tagoloan were reporting suspected cholera cases.
