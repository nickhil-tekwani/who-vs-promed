[It is good that the fighting cock owners reported the disease to
SENASA officials, or that disease intelligence information identified
the outbreak before it spread. Newcastle disease in a fighting cock
population is hard to control and can easily spill over into
commercial flocks by the movement of people and fomites. - Mod.PC]
