[Brucellosis does occur from time to time in swine herds in Europe.
These infections generally originate from contact with wild boars
that are infected.

ProMED-mail's animal health moderator Dr. Arnon Shimshony has
published a nice review of Brucellosis suis in swine -- see
Infectious Disease News - Porcine Brucellosis: another common
zoonosis in pigs
<http://www.infectiousdiseasenews.com/article/40915.aspx>. Of note,
if this turn out to be serovar 2, it is entirely possible that the
strain might not be zoonotic -- see discussion in Brucellosis,
porcine - Germany: (MV), serovar 2 20080923.2995

Dr. Shimshony points out that control can either be through
depopulation or test and slaughter combined with quarantine. It
appears the approach in this case will be the slower but economically
less painful (in short run) approach using test and slaughter. It
would be interesting to understand what motivated the decision in
this case as cleaning up a herd infected with brucellosis can be
challenging and time consuming.

OIE WAHID report referenced above. - Mod. PC]
