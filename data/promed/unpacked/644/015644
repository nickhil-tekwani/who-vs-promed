South Dakota's chronic wasting disease (CWD) testing update -- 2007
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 2532 total samples were collected since 1 Jul 2007. Most
samples are from the Black Hills and from prairie hunting units in
Fall River, Custer, and eastern Pennington counties of western South
Dakota. Some samples were collected in Grant and Deuel Counties in
East River. Most samples were taken from hunter-harvested animals.

Results
-------
As of 30 Jan 2008 we have received results from the SDSU (South
Dakota State University) Diagnostic Lab or Wind Cave National Park on
2531 samples listed below; one result is pending. [These comprised]
474 elk, 600 mule deer, and 1457 white-tailed deer

Of the 2531 samples tested to date, we have found one CWD positive
elk and 15 CWD positive deer. Below is a summary of these animals:

1. White-tailed female from Unit BD3 in Pennington County. (Hunter Harvest)
2. Elk female from Unit H3B in Custer County. (Hunter harvest)
3. White-tailed female from Unit BD3 in Pennington County. (Vehicle Kill)
4. White-tailed male from Rapid City in Pennington County. (Vehicle Kill)
5. White-tailed female from Unit 21A in Pennington County. (Hunter Harvest)
6. White-tailed male from Unit 27B in Fall River County. (Hunter Harvest)
7. Mule deer male from Unit 27A in Fall River County. (Hunter Harvest)
8. Mule deer female from Unit 27B in Fall River County. (Hunter Harvest)
9. White-tailed female from Unit CU1 in CSP [Custer State Park] in
Custer County. (Hunter Harvest)
10. White-tailed male from Unit 27A in Fall River County. (Hunter Harvest)
11. White-tailed female from Unit 27B in Fall River County. (Hunter Harvest)
12. Mule deer male from Unit 27B in Fall River County. (Hunter Harvest)
13. Mule deer male from Unit 27A in Fall River County. (Hunter Harvest)
14. Mule deer female from Unit BD4 in Fall River County. (Sick/Surveillance)
15. Mule deer female from Unit 27B in Fall River County. (Hunter Harvest)
16. White-tailed female from Unit 27B in Fall River County. (Hunter Harvest)

In summary:
South Dakota Department of Game Fish and Parks has found 16 cases of
CWD (one elk, 15 deer) in free ranging cervids in the testing period
1 Jul 2007 to present.

To date, South Dakota has found 74 cases of CWD (54 deer and 20 elk)
in free ranging deer and elk since testing began in 1997. Wind Cave
National Park accounts for 17 of these animals (9 elk, 8 deer). A
total of 17 378 wild deer and elk have been tested for CWD since 1997.

Hunters may get their animal tested for chronic wasting disease by
making their own arrangements directly through the SDSU Diagnostic
Lab at (605) 688-5171

[Fall River County is in the southeastern corner of SD (see map at
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_River_County,_South_Dakota>;
Custer adjoins it immediately to the north; and Pennington is on
Custer's eastern border and north of the Pine Ridge Reservation. Or
all these affected deer came from one tight corner of the state. Even
without denominators of deer submitted from other counties there
appears to be a region of high risk for cervid CWD in south eastern
SD. This raises a question as to how many deer were submitted from
the Pine Ridge Reservation as from these data it would not be at all
unlikely for this disease to be there, or at least needs
investigation if this disease is ever to be cost-effectively controlled.

If you go to the Nebraska Game & Parks Commission "Chronic Wasting
Disease" you can click on their CWD map & tabular data sub-page:
<http://www.ngpc.state.ne.us/wildlife/guides/cwd/maps.asp>. From
this you will see that nearly all the cases seen in NE deer are in
the "Panhandle" or far western segment of the state, with a tight
little cluster in Sioux County, NE, abutting Fall River County, SD.
Historically there is a larger series in the SE corner of that
panhandle indicating problems in northern Colorado.

For maps & data on CWD in Colorado go to:

Wyoming Game & Fish Department -- <http://gf.state.wy.us/index.asp>
-- has yet to release their CWD data for 2007.
