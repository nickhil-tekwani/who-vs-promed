Indigenous Services Canada confirms that the cluster event in one household in the Stoney Nakoda First Nation was caused by common seasonal respiratory viral infections such as influenzae B, human metapneumovirus, entero, and rhinovirus. We cannot comment on any patient's medical history or condition for privacy reasons. However, there is no ongoing health risk to the community or general public.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Wadieh Yacoub for his prompt response to our request for information concerning an outbreak of an acute influenza-like respiratory illness that apparently involved 15 people whose ages range from a few months to late teen years from a single household in an Indigenous community near Calgary, Canada. The individuals in the household were said to have been sick for several days. The illness was fatal in an infant and required hospitalization in the other 14.

The Stoney Nakoda are an Indigenous people in Western Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakoda_(Stoney)). They live in a community about 60 km (about 37 mi) west of the city of Calgary, in the southern portion of the Canadian province of Alberta (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calgary).
