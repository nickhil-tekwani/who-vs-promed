Kenya: 6 People and Dairy Cattle Die After Rabid Dog Attacks
---------------------------------------------------
At least 6 people have died in the last 6 months in Bomet District after
being bitten by dogs infected with rabies following an outbreak of the
disease. The Veterinary Department has subsequently launched a baiting
exercise and has killed 950 dogs and 75 cats in the last 3 weeks. The
District Veterinary Officer, Dr David Soo, told the Press in his office
that the department had in the last 3 weeks vaccinated 5000 dogs in
Longisa, Ndanai, Siongiroi, Bomet Central, Mutharakwa and Sigor Divisions
since the exercise started.
Soo confirmed that the rabid dogs had also killed 5 dairy cattle in the
same period. Soo further revealed that 10 dogs have died of rabies in
various parts of the district and several cats had also succumbed to the
disease for lack of treatment [vaccination].
