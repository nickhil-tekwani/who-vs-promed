Situation summary in the Americas

In 2019, 3 countries in the region of the Americas (Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru) have reported confirmed yellow fever cases occurring between December 2018 and February 2019.

In 2018, there were 5 countries and territories in the region of the Americas that reported confirmed cases of yellow fever: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, and Peru.

The following provides a situation summary of the countries that reported confirmed yellow fever cases in 2019:

In Bolivia, a confirmed yellow fever case was reported in a 17-year-old unvaccinated male with onset of symptoms on 11 Feb 2019 and probable site of infection in Villa Tunari, Cochabamba department, an area considered at risk for yellow fever. There have been no reports of epizootics [cases in non-human primates] associated with this case. Samples were tested at the National Center for Tropical Diseases (CENETROP, per its acronym in Spanish) and confirmed for yellow fever by IgM detection and PCR technique.

The last previous confirmed yellow fever case had been reported in the province of San Ramon, Beni department, in 2018. In the last 5 years, Bolivia has reported 6 confirmed cases, the majority of which occurred in La Paz department.

Brazil is currently in the period historically recognized as having the highest transmission (seasonal period), which occurs between December and May. The expansion of the historical area of yellow fever transmission to areas previously considered risk-free led to 2 waves of transmission (Figure 1), one during the 2016-2017 seasonal period, with 778 confirmed human cases, including 262 deaths, and another during the 2017-2018 seasonal period, with 1376 confirmed human cases, including 483 deaths.

In the current seasonal period (2018-2019), 50 confirmed human cases, including 12 deaths, have been reported in the states of Sao Paulo (46 cases) and Parana (4 cases). In Sao Paulo, the municipalities considered as probable sites of infection are Eldorado (15 cases), Iporanga (12 cases), Cananeia (4 cases), Cajati (3 cases), Barra do Turbo (2 cases), Jacupiranga (2 cases), Caraguatatuba (1 case), Registro (1 case), Pariquera-açu (1 case), Serra Negra (1 case), Sete Barras (1 case), Juquia (1 case), and Vargem (1 case); the probable site of infection for 1 case remains under investigation. With the exception of Serra Negra, Vargem (bordering the state of Minas Gerais), and Caraguatatuba, the rest of the municipalities are in the southern part of the state of Sao Paulo.

The probable sites of infection for the 4 confirmed cases in the state of Parana are Guaraqueçaba (2 cases) and Adrianopolis (2 cases) municipalities.

Among confirmed cases, 90% (45/50) are male, and the median age is 43 years (range 18 to 87 years). All of the deaths occurred among confirmed cases in the state of Sao Paulo.

To date, the number of human cases reported during the current 2018-2019 seasonal period is substantially lower than observed during the 2 previous seasonal periods, when the number of cases surpassed that which was reported in several decades. Nonetheless, the occurrence of cases and epizootics in the southern part of the state of Sao Paulo and in the state of Parana indicates the progression of transmission towards the southeast and south regions of the country (Figure 2), with the possibility of reaching bordering countries such as Argentina and Paraguay.

In the 2018-2019 seasonal period, most of the confirmed epizootics (90%) were reported in the southeast region of the country (27/30). In epidemiological week (EW) 4 of 2019, a confirmed epizootic was also reported in the south region in the state of Parana, in areas where yellow fever virus circulation was not detected since the re-emergence of the virus in 2014.

In Peru, between EW 1 and EW 8 of 2019, 9 cases of yellow fever were reported, including one confirmed case and 8 probable cases that remain under investigation.

In the last 5 years (2014-2018), a total of 121 yellow fever cases were reported in Peru, of which 21 were confirmed and 100 cases were classified as probable.

Advice for national authorities
The Pan American Health Organization / World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) encourages member states with areas at risk for yellow fever continue efforts to immunize the at-risk populations and to take the necessary actions to keep travelers informed and vaccinated prior to traveling to areas where yellow fever vaccination is recommended.

Recommendations for international travelers regarding yellow fever vaccination are available at http://www.who.int/ith/en/.

The guidelines pertaining to laboratory diagnosis and vaccinations are the same as those published in the 7 Dec 2018 PAHO/WHO epidemiological update 1.

[Since there is no indication of occurrence of _Aedes aegypti_ urban yellow fever (YF) virus transmission, it is assumed that all cases are the result of sylvan (forest) transmission. Although YF incidence is not as frequent as it was last year (2018), the situation for Brazil warrants close surveillance, since the YF transmission season for the current year (2019) is just beginning. The percent vaccination coverages for the affected municipalities in Sao Paulo state are not mentioned. Statewide, the 6.5 million individuals already vaccinated represent just 53.6% coverage of the population, far short of the 80% or more necessary to provide good YF coverage. One hopes that the nationwide vaccination campaign planned for this year (2019) will focus on the areas where the YF cases have occurred. These sylvan YF cases are of concern because of the risk of introduction of the virus into urban and suburban settings where _Aedes aegypti_ vector mosquitoes are abundant and could initiate a rapidly spreading urban outbreak.

The Peruvian and Bolivian cases are not surprising, since YF virus is endemic in forests of the Amazon Basin areas, and there is an ongoing risk of YF cases if individuals who reside in or visit these areas are not vaccinated.
