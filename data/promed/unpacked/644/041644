Abstract
---------
Canine leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease in many countries. This review examines potential drivers for increased diagnoses of canine leptospirosis in the United States and Canada, using the epidemiologic triad of agent-environment-host as a template.

_Leptospira_ spp. are classified into more than 250 serovars, but in many laboratories only 6 are routinely tested for in serologic agglutination tests of canine sera. Leptospiral infections in dogs may potentially go undetected with unemployed or currently employed diagnostic methods.

Disease transmission from infected reservoir hosts usually occurs via urine-contaminated environmental sources such as water. Direct contact between infected and susceptible individuals, environmental factors such as climate changes in temperature and/or rainfall, and increasing number and urbanization of reservoir hosts may greatly increase dog exposure risks.

A dog's lifestyle may influence exposure risk to leptospirosis, but vaccination based on proper identification of circulating serogroups dramatically reduces post-exposure infections.

Regrettably, resistance to vaccination by veterinarians and dog owners leaves a large number of dogs at risk for this zoonotic disease.

Dog owners are being warned about leptospirosis, with warnings of growing case numbers of the potentially deadly disease could worsen as wet weather continues.

The number of claims for leptospirosis treatment has exploded, with a 250% rise from February to September [2022], as rain conditions worsened across eastern Australia, according to insurance company PetSure.

Leptospirosis, a bacterial disease affecting both humans and animals like dogs, is spread through the urine of infected animals, with rats being the most likely culprit for infection in Australia.

With the disease spreading through contaminated water, there are warnings that those in flood-affected areas are at a heightened risk, and continuing wet weather could expose more dogs and people, according to University of Queensland Associate Professor Rowland Cobbold.

"The more water you have around, the more wet the environment, the more likely the disease is to survive and the higher likelihood of leptospirosis exposure," Professor Cobbold said.

Many dogs who contract the disease only have mild signs; however, they can go on to develop kidney failure and jaundice, with many passing away after becoming infected, according to PetSure vet adviser Dr Betty Chan.

"The signs of leptospirosis in dogs vary but generally may include fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, depression, weakness, or a reluctance to move," she said.

Not only is the disease debilitating for pets and stressful for owners, but it can also be costly.

The average cost of treatment sits at AUD 4330 but can run as high as AUD 18 482 in some cases, according to PetSure.

There has been an explosion of cases across NSW in recent years, according to University of Sydney senior lecturer in veterinary science Dr Christine Griebsch.

"It started in the City of Sydney; there was then more of a spread to other areas of Sydney and outside. This year has seen a surge of cases on the south coast and also in Newcastle," Dr Griebsch said. "There were no recorded cases in dogs since 1976, then one case in 2017, 2 in 2018, and now there's been 60 cases in the past 2 years."

The south coast is of particular concern with over half of the cases of dogs being reported in this area.

Dr Griebsch agreed La Nina is likely to be contributing to the rise in case numbers.

"The highest risk is when it's really, really wet, as it survives in moist environments like soil and water puddles," she said.

According to PetSure, the highest number of claims was in August [2022], which coincided with rainfall 34% above average.

Pet owners who live in high-risk areas like the south coast and Newcastle are urged to get their dogs vaccinated, Dr Chan says.

However, vaccination might not be enough according to Professor Cobbold.

"The main problem with the vaccine is it's not 100% effective. There are about 200 strains of leptospirosis, and the vaccine only covers 2. Most of the time, dogs don't get those 2 strains," he said. "Vaccines will help protect dogs, but unfortunately, they aren't completely effective."

Dr Griebsch recommends dog owners stay vigilant with their pets to avoid them getting sick.

"The most important risk mitigation strategy is to avoid contact with stagnant water like ponds and water puddles," she said. "If there's an area where there have been cases, I would also maybe avoid doggie daycare.

"I also get a little bit twitchy when I see these doggie water bowls outside of cafes and such. I wonder whether they've been left out overnight and whether rats have had access to them. I would be very careful to let my dog drink out of these communal water bowls."

[These 2 articles on leptospirosis seem to both point out that there are more serovars than our vaccinations contain. It seems like the 5-7 serovars in the USA vaccine is more than the 2 serovars in the Australian vaccine. Depending upon what serovars are circulating the most in Australia, perhaps they could examine the US vaccine for licensure in Australia. I realize this sounds simple, but if it could be accomplished, it would give more protection to the dogs in Australia.

"Leptospirosis in dogs
------------------------
"Dogs are susceptible to infection by many leptospiral serovars, with clinical signs of leptospirosis ranging from mild, subclinical infection to acute kidney injury, hepatopathy, respiratory disease, or death. Diagnosis includes serologic testing and identification of leptospires in tissues, blood, or urine. Doxycycline is the primary drug used for treatment in dogs, along with appropriate supportive care. Polyvalent vaccines are available for prevention. Specific serovars in a geographic area vary, so vaccines with the appropriate types should be used. Because it is a zoonotic disease, clinicians must remain vigilant for leptospirosis and should be aware of its different clinical presentations.

"Leptospirosis in dogs is an infectious disease caused by bacteria in the genus _Leptospira_.

"Dogs are the maintenance host for _Leptospira interrogans_ serovar Canicola, and before widespread vaccination programs, serovars Canicola and Icterohaemorrhagiae were the most common serovars in dogs in the US. The prevalence of canine serovars has shifted significantly in the past few decades, and the serovars that cause disease in dogs are likely to vary with geographic region and the presence of reservoir hosts. Unfortunately, current understanding of the serovars that cause natural disease in dogs is limited by the fact that isolation of leptospires is rarely performed; thus, studies to date have relied on serologic data.

"Unfortunately, the results of serologic testing (with the microscopic agglutination test [MAT]) do not reliably predict the infecting serovar in dogs (or humans) with leptospirosis; thus, the true infecting serovar is unknown in most cases. However, it is likely that the serovars that cause disease in dogs are those circulating in local wildlife.

"Knowledge of the infecting serovar in dogs is essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine development; it is less important for clinicians managing individual cases.

"It is currently not known whether specific serovars are associated with specific clinical signs of leptospirosis in dogs, and there is no published evidence to guide therapy based on serovar identification. It is, however, extremely important for veterinarians to maintain a high index of suspicion for leptospirosis, because this is a zoonotic disease and has a wide range of clinical presentations in dogs. Any age, breed, or sex of dog is susceptible to leptospirosis, and the diagnosis should not be excluded on the basis of signalment or lifestyle. Canine leptospirosis is not restricted to large-breed dogs, male dogs, or dogs with a predominantly outdoor lifestyle.

"Clinical signs and test results of leptospirosis in dogs
---------------------------------------------------------------
"Acute kidney injury has been the most common presentation for canine leptospirosis in recent years. Dogs affected by leptospirosis might show clinical signs that include lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, and polyuria, oliguria, or anuria.

"Serum biochemistry or serum blood gas analysis might show abnormalities such as azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, and hypo- or hyperkalemia.

"Urinalysis might show abnormalities such as hyposthenuria, isosthenuria, or minimal concentration; proteinuria; glucosuria (with normal blood glucose); cylindruria; hematuria; or pyuria.

"Dogs that survive acute kidney injury may return to baseline or progress to chronic kidney disease. Leptospirosis should also be considered in any dog with previously diagnosed chronic kidney disease that develops acute-on-chronic kidney injury.

"Polyuria and polydipsia in the absence of azotemia is also observed in some dogs with leptospirosis, possibly as a result of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Leptospirosis could also potentially be associated with renal tubular acidosis.

"Acute liver disease can accompany acute kidney injury in dogs with leptospirosis, or it can occur alone. Clinical signs might include icterus, vomiting, anorexia, and lethargy.

"Serum biochemical analysis might show the following abnormalities:
- increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity
- increased ALT activity (usually less increased than ALP activity)
- increased bilirubin concentration

"Muscle pain, stiffness, weakness, trembling, or reluctance to move can occur in dogs with leptospirosis. These signs can be the result of vasculitis, myositis, or nephritis. Myalgia is commonly reported in human leptospirosis and is associated with the septicemic phase of the disease.

"Less common manifestations of canine leptospirosis include bleeding disorders, suspected to be caused by vasculitis. Clinical signs may include petechial hemorrhages, epistaxis, melena, and hematemesis. A CBC might show mild to moderate thrombocytopenia (not severe enough to cause spontaneous bleeding). Coagulation testing might show increased fibrin degradation products, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) or prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).

"Pulmonary hemorrhage is now one of the most common clinical signs in outbreaks of human leptospirosis. This is a less common finding in canine leptospirosis; however, cough or dyspnea, or radiographic abnormalities have been noted in a number of affected dogs.

"Uveitis is an uncommon manifestation of leptospirosis in dogs. It appears to be infrequently associated with experimental canine leptospirosis; however, rare case reports exist.

"Additional clinical signs reported in dogs with leptospirosis include vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, hypothermia, oculonasal discharge, lymphadenopathy, effusions, and edema.

"Other nonspecific CBC changes might include neutrophilia, lymphopenia, monocytosis, or mild anemia.

"Thoracic radiographs might show diffuse or caudodorsal reticulonodular pulmonary opacities, likely because of pulmonary hemorrhage. Abdominal radiographs might be normal or might show renomegaly or hepatomegaly.

"Changes noted on abdominal ultrasound examination might include renomegaly, pyelectasia, increased cortical or medullary echogenicity, perinephric effusion, hyperechoic renal medullary band, hepatomegaly, hypoechoic liver, gallbladder abnormalities, or abdominal effusion or edema. These changes are not specific for leptospirosis, and absence of these findings does not exclude the diagnosis.

"Gross necropsy findings can include jaundice, effusions, and petechial or ecchymotic hemorrhages on any organ, pleural, or peritoneal surface. The kidneys and liver might be enlarged, and lungs can be wet, heavy, and discolored. The liver is often friable with an accentuated lobular pattern and might have a yellowish-brown discoloration. The kidneys might have white foci on the subcapsular surface. Microscopic findings in the liver could include mild random hepatocytic necrosis, nonsuppurative hepatitis, and intrahepatic bile stasis, while swollen tubular epithelial cells, tubular necrosis, and a mixed inflammatory reaction can occur in the kidneys.

"Diagnosis of leptospirosis in dogs
-------------------------------------
- Combination of the following findings: acute azotemia, cholestatic liver disease, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, and glucosuria with normal blood glucose
- Serologic testing to detect antibodies, combined with PCR assay to detect organisms

"The results of all diagnostic tests should be interpreted in light of the animal's vaccination history, clinical signs, and clinicopathologic findings. The table Comparison of Tests Used to Diagnose Leptospirosis in Dogs summarizes the currently available tests and their advantages and disadvantages. A combination of acute and convalescent MAT titers and PCR assays on blood (early stages of disease) or urine (later stages of disease) is recommended.

"Treatment of leptospirosis in dogs
---------------------------------------
- Supportive care, together with specific antimicrobial therapy
- Doxycycline to eliminate both the leptospiremic and carrier phases of infection

"Supportive measures for acute kidney injury and liver disease might include fluid therapy, with electrolyte supplementation as necessary; correction of acid-base disorders; antiemetics; phosphate binders; hepatic support medications; or appetite stimulants.

"Renal replacement therapy with intermittent hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should be considered for dogs that are anuric or oliguric despite appropriate supportive therapy. Antimicrobial therapy is indicated whenever leptospirosis is suspected and should be instituted before confirmatory test results are available. There are limited case reports in dogs, but no experimental studies, to guide selection of antimicrobial protocols for this species.

"Current recommendations are to treat with doxycycline (5 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours, for 2 weeks). For dogs that cannot tolerate doxycycline, initial therapy with a penicillin is appropriate; however, this course of therapy should be followed by a 2-week course of doxycycline treatment to eliminate the renal carrier phase of infection. Enrofloxacin or clarithromycin might also be used to eliminate the carrier phase. Dogs recently exposed to leptospirosis can be treated prophylactically with oral administration of doxycycline for 14 days.

"Prevention of leptospirosis in dogs
--------------------------------------
Commercial bacterins for dogs are available for serovars Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Grippotyphosa, and Pomona in the US. It is not known whether vaccinated dogs are susceptible to infection with other serovars, although there is some experimental evidence for cross-protection. In general, currently available vaccines provide good protection from disease for at least one year, and also reduce renal colonization and urine shedding. Concerns exist regarding hypersensitivity reactions after leptospiral vaccination in dogs; however, vaccination against _Leptospira_ (an organism that can cause fatal disease) is safe in most cases, and studies have shown no significant increase in hypersensitivity reactions, compared with other vaccinations. Adverse reactions are perhaps associated with the use of more highly purified vaccines. Prior recommendations for vaccinating every 6 months are also no longer justified.

Zoonotic risk of leptospirosis in dogs
------------------------------------
Because leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, all veterinary personnel should take appropriate precautions when handling known or suspected infected animals. Such dogs do not need to be placed in isolation; however, they should be nursed with barrier precautions, paying particular attention to avoiding exposure of skin or mucous membranes to urine or blood. Infected dogs should be allowed to urinate in designated areas that can subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. The organisms are killed by all commonly used disinfectants. Owners of dogs recently diagnosed with canine leptospirosis should be advised of the zoonotic nature of the disease and contact their physicians with any health concerns. Owners should wear gloves when cleaning up urine and should wash their hands after handling the dog, at least until the course of antimicrobial therapy is completed.

"Key points
-------------
- Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease found in multiple wild and domestic species, including dogs, and often transmitted by direct contact with urine or other body fluids of an infected host, although environmental contamination by urine can lead to transmission if conditions are suitable.
- Diagnosis is by serologic testing, along with one or more methods to identify the organism in tissues or body fluids.
- The treatment of choice is doxycycline, with appropriate supportive care as needed. Other antimicrobials, such as enrofloxacin, may also be effective. Vaccines can be used for prevention. Multistrain vaccines that include locally prevalent serovars should be used.
- Zoonotic infections are not common; however, occupational exposure is a risk factor. The principal route of transmission is by contact with infectious body fluids." - Mod.TG
