Up to 400 000 people could be infected by a single cow with BSE (bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, mad cow disease) entering the food chain,
according to a report by an official EU (European Union) scientific
committee.
The report, prepared by the EU Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) on human
exposure risks of BSE via the food chain, has been released on the Internet.
It is not known what the threshold dose for infection is, or what effect
repeated low doses of infected meat might have.
Its worst scenario involved a single infected animal entering the food
chain, with the full carcass being processed into food products including
the so-called "specified risk materials" (SRM) -- the brain, spinal cord and
certain internal organs. It suggests up to 400 000 people could be exposed
to infected material in such a circumstance.
"Recent evidence suggests in countries with a reported low incidence, the
actual rate of BSE infected animals entering the food chain is not nil," the
report stated. "Presently available methods to prevent an infected animal
entering the food chain are far from being satisfactory."
A single infected animal could contaminate up to 116 tons of minced meat
product. The SRM tissues presented the greatest risk to human health because
they contained the highest concentration of BSE infectivity. "Intestines
used from young infected animals are of particular concern since they become
infectious in an early stage of the BSE incubation.The SSC is aware of the
direct human consumption of both intestines and brain material by many
population groups within the EU and now has evidence of brain and spinal
material being used in common meat products such as pates and sausages."
The report removes any comfort to be drawn by those countries, such as
Ireland, with a relatively low BSE infection rate. "Since there is
inter-member state transfer of animals, crossborder trading in animal organs
and marketing of offals, ingredients and processed foods into and out of
most EU member states, it is reasonable to conclude that the risk of human
exposure to BSE infectivity within any one country is not necessarily linked
to the geographical burden of infectivity in the cattle within that member
state."
It said the "ideal level" of protection of consumers from exposure to BSE
infectivity is "the absence of infected animals from the human food chain."
If this could not be reasonably guaranteed, the second level of protection
involved "the removal of SRMs" from processing. "Failure to do so is likely
to expose a large number of consumers to an unnecessary risk."
The risk of BSE-infected meat is associated with its transfer to humans in
the form of variant Creutzfeld Jacob Disease (vCJD or nvCJD). The disease is
invariably fatal but so far is comparatively rare. About 50 cases have been
diagnosed in the UK, including one in Northern Ireland. One has been found
in the Republic of Ireland.

What the Irish Times article refers to is the Scientific Steering
Committee's "OPINION OF THE SCIENTIFIC STEERING COMMITTEE ON THE HUMAN
EXPOSURE RISK (HER) VIA FOOD WITH RESPECT TO BSE," adopted on 10 Dec 1999,
and placed on the EU DG Health Consumer Protection Web Site on 4 Jan 2000
at:
http://europa.eu.int/comm/dg24/health/sc/ssc/out67_en.html
It is a 27 page document in pdf format.
Given that a short media report cannot reflect the full picture of 27 pages
and will inevitably select the "juiciest" quotes of the worst case scenario
of those considered in the Report, I think that the article is reasonably
correct factually.
However, while it states that the scenario it gives is based on 'the full
carcass being processed into food products including the so-called
"specified risk materials" (SRM) -- the brain, spinal cord and certain
internal organs', it does not add the Report points out that:
"7 Member States of the European Union are removing SRMs (BE, FR, *IRE,*
LUX, NL, PT and UK). AT, DE; DK, HE; SF, and SW do not have an SRM-ban in
place, Italy and Spain request removal of SRM from animals from Countries
with BSE."
In view of the fact Ireland is among the countries removing SRMs, it may be
judged that the omission of that information from the article in the Irish
Times is misleading to its readers.
