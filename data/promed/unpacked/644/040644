On 22 Oct 2012, the Hellenic Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (KEELPNO) reported 5 new malaria _Plasmodium vivax_ autochthonous cases in Greece.

- 2 cases are located in Karditsa regional unit, Thessaly region (cf. map 1 [available at the source URL above]). It is the 1st time that this area is reporting autochthonous malaria _P. vivax_ cases. According to KEELPNO, these cases are considered to have a direct epidemiological relation with a cluster of 8 imported cases.

- 3 other cases were reported in Laconia regional unit, Peloponnese region. These 5 cases had onset of symptoms between weeks 38 and 42 (between 17 Sep and 21 Oct 2012).

- To date, a total of 16 autochthonous cases infected in 2012 has been reported in 4 different regions in Greece:
4 in East Attica regional unit. The 1st autochthonous malaria case was reported on 18 Jun 2012 (cf. eWEB no. 224; [http://www.episouthnetwork.org/sites/default/files/bulletin_file/eweb_224_04_06_12.pdf]). 8 in Laconia regional unit, Peloponnese region. 1 in Xanthi regional unit, East of Macedonia and Thrace region. 2 in Karditsa regional unit, Thessaly region.

Comment
-------
The occurrence of new cases in Laconia regional unit was not unexpected considering the establishment of a local transmission cycle of _P. vivax_ malaria in this area.
On 1 Oct 2010, one case was reported in Xanthi regional unit. It was the 1st time that this area reported _P. vivax_ autochthonous cases.
The report of a _P. vivax_ malaria case in the new area of Karditsa regional unit strongly suggests an extension of the circulation of malaria in other areas in Greece.

[The 5 reported cases bring the total number autochthonous _P. vivax_ cases in Greece this year [2012] to 16. We have previously pointed out that genotyping is mandatory to understand the transmission and ProMED-mail will be happy to post these data when available.

The present report underlines that the outbreak is not under control despite the increased surveillance and active case detection in the vicinity of the cases.

With the incubation period as long as 8 to 9 months it can be difficult to determine exactly where the patient was infected, and this makes active case detection less effective. - Mod.EP
