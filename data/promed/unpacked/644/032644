Advice for Eco-tourists
-----------------------
I read with interest the recent observations on vampire bats. I recall
that during my association with the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory in Panama
there was a Boy Scout troop from the Canal Zone that ran into the
problem. They camped out in a jungle area, in a prepared camp where the
sleeping platforms were raised off the floor. Apparently not having to
worry about ground-dwelling critters, a number of the kids did not use
mosquito nets, to the bats' delight. As these were the days of duck-embryo
vaccine and 21 shots in the tummy area, they learned a memorable
lesson. Considering the boom in eco-tourism, I think this makes the point
that if you are going to sleep or camp outside in vampire bat areas, you
had best take precautions.
