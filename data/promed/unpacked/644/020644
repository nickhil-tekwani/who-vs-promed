Hundreds of French tourists fell violently sick at a posh Greek hotel, creating what one visitor called an "apocalyptic" scene that had guests vomiting in the swimming pool and hallways. A mysterious vomiting bug is sweeping through a 5 star resort on the island of Rhodes and has sickened hundreds of French tourists who are now demanding answers.

One visitor described the nausea-inducing scene at the Lindos Imperial Resort and Spa to French daily La Depeche this week. "Like hundreds of other holidaymakers, my family and I suddenly came down with vomiting and acute diarrhea. My wife even got sick in a restaurant," the tourist, who spent 20 000 euros on the 2-week trip for his family, told the paper. "I saw people vomit in the pools and hallways... everywhere. It was Dantean, apocalyptic."

In a meeting the angry and ill guests had with management, they were told little about what was causing the outbreak. The manager reportedly tried to minimize the number of sick, saying there were at most 100 ill people.

A press release from the resort said: "The island of Rhodes is presently impacted by a virus that's in the air, but the food and water have nothing to do with it." The vagueness of the explanation has done little to satisfy the tourists' desire for answers.

[The pathogen causing this "Dantean" event on the Island of Rhodes is most likely a norovirus. The following is a short summary from WebMD about the virus (http://www.webmd.com/children/norovirus-symptoms-and-treatment):

"Nothing can ruin a vacation like a bout of vomiting, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Noroviruses have become notorious for sending hundreds of cruise ship passengers at a time running for their respective bathrooms and for steering entire ships back to port early.

Back on dry land, noroviruses also have a big impact on people's health. The CDC estimates that noroviruses are responsible for more than half of all food-borne disease outbreaks each year. And noroviruses are the most common cause of diarrhea in adults and the 2nd most common cause in children.

Noroviruses are a group of viruses that cause inflammation of the stomach and large intestine lining (gastroenteritis); they are the leading cause of gastroenteritis in the USA. The norovirus was originally called the Norwalk virus after the town of Norwalk, Ohio, the location of the 1st confirmed outbreak in 1972.

Noroviruses are sometimes called food poisoning because they can be transmitted through food that has been contaminated with the virus. They aren't always the result of food contamination, though. Noroviruses are also sometimes called the stomach flu, although they aren't the influenza virus." - Mod.LL
