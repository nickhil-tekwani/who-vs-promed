INFLUENZA A/H5N1, CLINICAL FINDINGS
***********************************
A ProMED-mail post
Date: Fri, 13 Feb 1998 19:06:44 +0800
From: Charles H. Calisher <calisher@usa.healthnet.org>
Source: The Lancet 351:467-471, 1998
Origin: The H5N1 study group of The Hospital Authority of Hong Kong, The
Chinese University of Hong Kong and The University of Hong Kong.

A paper entitled "Clinical features and rapid viral diagnosis of human
disease associated with avian influenza A H5N1 virus" appeared in The
Lancet. It documents data on the first 12 cases of H5N1 influenza in Hong
Kong. The key findings are these:
Patients ranged from 1-60 years of age. Clinical presentation was that of
an influenza-like illness. Five patients had clinical or radiological
evidence of pneumonia at the time of presentation to hospital and two
others developed pneumonic changes after hospitalisation. Bacteria commonly
associated with community-acquired pneumonia such as _Streptococcus
pneumoniae_, _Haemophilus influenzae_ and _Staph. aureus_ were not isolated
from the respiratory tract or blood cultures in any of the patients. All 7
patients older than 13 years had severe disease (4 deaths) whereas children
5 years or younger had relatively less severe disease with the exception of
one who died with Reye's syndrome associated with intake of aspirin.
Gastrointestinal manifestations, elevated liver enzymes, renal failure
unrelated to rhabdomyolysis and pancytopenia were unusually prominent in
these patients. Factors associated with severe disease (i.e., those
requiring intensive care or ventilator support) included older age, delay
in hospitalisation, lower respiratory tract involvement and a low total
peripheral white blood cell count or lymphopenia at admission.
The results of type and subtype specific rapid diagnostic tests for
detection of influenza A in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal aspirates were
compared. An H5-specific reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
assay was the most sensitive test for rapid diagnosis. A commercially
available enzyme immunoassay (Directigen Flu A; Becton Dickinson) was more
sensitive than direct immunofluorescence for rapid viral diagnosis of H5N1
infected patients. Later in December 1997, when influenza A H3N2 and H1N1
began to co-circulate in the human population, rapid exclusion of H5N1
influenza in those specimens positive for influenza A by type specific
(reactive with the influenza A nucleoprotein, i.e., reacts with all human
influenza A) rapid tests became important. A diagnosis of H5N1 influenza
could be reliably excluded in those specimens that were strongly reactive
by immunofluorescence (i.e., >10 fluorescent positive cells / spot) with
the influenza A type specific reagent but negative with the H5 subtype
specific monoclonal antibody pool.
