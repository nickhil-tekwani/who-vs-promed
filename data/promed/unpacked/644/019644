Children poisoned by dairy goods in Ukraine
-------------------------------------------
17 children from the Novovodolazskaya boarding school in the Kharkov
Region, Ukraine, aged between 6 and 14, were admitted within 24 hours to
the infection section of the local district hospital with signs of acute
food poisoning. The preliminary reason given for the disease is substandard
food, Tass learned from the press service of the Ukrainian Ministry for
Emergencies on Sun, 23 May 2004.
The number of sick children in Kharkov increased as well. According to the
regional center of the Ministry for Emergencies, already 117 children aged
2 to 7 years have fallen ill, with 101 being hospitalized. 16 children
whose disease is not very serious are being treated at outpatient
departments. They are being provided with all forms of medical treatment.
According to medics, the state of hospitalized children is not serious.
Doctors have not ruled out dysentery.
It was established during the investigation by law enforcement bodies,
along with a special commission of the regional administration, that a
businessman who supplied dairy products to children's pre-school
establishments purchased uncertified milk and sour cream from private persons.
Under a contract, he was duty-bound to purchase them at a dairy.

[It is suggested that uncertified -- possibly unpasteurized -- dairy
products were the culprit in this multicentric outbreak. - Mod.LL]
