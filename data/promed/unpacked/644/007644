[1] Europe: easing restrictions for the holiday season
Date: Wed 25 Nov 2020 12:16 AM GMT +1

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/france-britain-lift-coronavirus-lockdowns/2020/11/24/fc27662c-2e60-11eb-9dd6-2d0179981719_story.html


Leaders in France and Britain on Tuesday [24 Nov 2020] announced tentative easings of lockdown restrictions heading into the Christmas holiday season while acknowledging that the coronavirus was far from under control.

The decision to reopen shops, resume indoor entertainment, and allow limited holiday gatherings appeared to rub up against a consensus among scientists, who have underscored the risks of indoor socializing and have warned of the danger in lifting restrictions too rapidly. But many European leaders seem reluctant to keep their economies closed or to stand in the way of family members seeing each other after a year marked by long periods of strict confinement measures and social isolation.

French President Emmanuel Macron began a national address Tuesday [24 Nov 2020] by outlining what restrictions would remain in place in the coming weeks: "We will have to continue to stay at home, to telecommute when possible, to give up private meetings, family gatherings, and all nonessential travel." But he outlined a 3-step deconfinement plan under which nonessential shops could reopen starting Saturday [28 Nov 2020] and cinemas and theaters could welcome back audiences in mid-December [2020]. Restaurants would need to remain closed into January 2021, he said, and an evening curfew would remain in place. But exceptions would be granted for Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve so that people could "share these moments together among family," Macron said.

Vaccination, he added, would begin in late December [2020] or early January [2021] and would not be mandatory.

In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced plans for the national lockdown to end [2 Dec 2020], to be replaced by a region-by-region tiered system of restrictions. Most of the country would be in the highest 2 tiers, requiring the closure of restaurants and pubs except for takeaway service. But in many places, shops, gyms, and salons would be allowed to reopen, and indoor and outdoor spectator sports could resume.

On Tuesday [24 Nov 2020], the 4 nations of the United Kingdom -- England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland -- also agreed to an easing of restrictions that would allow loved ones to meet during the Christmas period. From [23 to 27 Dec 2020] up to 3 households can form a "Christmas bubble" and mix indoors. During those few days, Britons will be able to travel across the country and move between tiers.

Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove told Sky News on Tuesday [24 Nov 2020] that families will have "something closer to a normal Christmas."

In Spain, the government is reportedly considering limiting family and other social gatherings over the holidays to just 6 people, in addition to imposing a 1 a.m. curfew on [24 Dec 2020 -- Christmas eve] and [31 Dec 2020 -- New Year's eve]. According to the newspaper El Pais, the government's draft document, titled "Proposals for COVID-19 public health measures for the celebration of Christmas fiestas," recommends socializing only with other members of the same household and limiting all outside contacts to 6 people.

Germany could follow soon. Chancellor Angela Merkel is to meet with leaders of the country's 16 federal states Wednesday [25 Nov 2020] to determine whether to extend a month-long November lockdown, which closed bars and ended eat-in dining but kept schools and stores open. Draft proposals would extend restrictions but include the possibility of a week-long ease in contact restrictions over the Christmas week, allowing gatherings of up to 10 people and an unlimited number of children under age 14.

But behind the easing of restrictions are continued concerns over case numbers, hospitalizations, and death tolls, which suggest Europe is barely past the peak of the 2nd wave.

"We have slowed down the circulation of the virus, but it remains very present in France as in the entire Northern Hemisphere," Macron said in his speech. "We must continue our efforts." In France, at least, the numbers have shown some sign of improvement after nearly a month of lockdown. On Tuesday [24 Nov 2020], the Health Ministry recorded 9155 new cases of coronavirus infections in the previous 24 hours but still a relatively high death toll of 458 in the same period, in keeping with totals recorded in previous weeks.

In comparison with the spring [2020], France's current occupancy of hospital intensive care units is similar to the level when the country loosened restrictions after the 1st wave of the novel coronavirus. As of Monday [23 Nov 2020], the country reported 4438 ICU cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. On [28 Apr 2020], the day Macron announced plans to loosen measures, 4307 ICU cases of COVID-19 were recorded. But France's hospitals are more saturated now than they were the 1st time around: numbers have been declining for only a week, compared with 2 weeks of declines before the springtime loosening of restrictions, and there are 31 449 hospitalizations now, 14 percent more than in the spring [2020].

In Britain, Tuesday's [24 Nov 2020] announcement of loosened restrictions for the Christmas holidays came shortly after the government said the latest daily death toll was 608, the highest recorded since May [2020]. And unlike in May [2020], when Johnson announced the 1st easing of restrictions after 4 weeks of emptying hospitals, numbers still are rising. There were 13 767 COVID patients in British hospitals on Monday [23 Nov 2020], the most since [22 Apr 2020] and double what they were a month ago. ICU occupancy is still rising. The only small comfort is that the rate at which hospitals are filling may have started slowing in the past week.

The British government urged people to continue to exercise caution, especially with those who are vulnerable. 'Tis the season to be jolly, but it's also the season to be jolly careful, especially with elderly relatives," Johnson said in a news briefing Monday [24 Nov 2020].

Macron warned citizens that if the government's public health guidelines were not followed, the virus could well return. He cautioned against overconfidence despite the brief respite of the holiday season. "There are always a lot of uncertainties, and we have to keep a lot of humility in this matter. This virus has taught us that," he said.

[2] Ecuador: reinfection

ref: Prado-Vivar B, Becerra-Wong M, Guadalupe JJ, et al. A case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in Ecuador. Lancet Infect Dis 2020; published online 23 Nov 2020; doi: 10.1016/S1473-3099(20)30910-5.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reinfection have been reported in Hong Kong, Belgium, the Netherlands, and the USA.[1,2,3,4] Here we report the 1st confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in Ecuador and South America. For full methodological details, see the appendix (pp 1, 2 [available at the source URL above]).

On [12 May 2020], a 46-year-old man presented in Quito, Ecuador, with 3 days of intense headache and drowsiness. On [16 May 2020], he took a rapid antibody test that was positive for IgM and negative for IgG. On [20 May 2020], the patient tested positive on RT-PCR (ORF3a gene, Cq=36.85). Subsequently, the patient's symptoms improved, and he tested negative on RT-PCR on [3 Jun 2020] (appendix p 4).

On [20 Jul 2020], the patient presented once again with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. This time the symptoms were more severe and included odynophagia, nasal congestion, fever of 38.5 deg C [101.3 deg F], back pain, productive cough, and dyspnoea. He received an RT-PCR test on [22 Jul 2020], with a positive result (N gene, Cq=30.82). Despite having moderate symptoms and dyspnoea, the patient did not require hospitalisation, and his clinical status improved after several days. A 4th RT-PCR test was done on [4 Aug 2020], which was negative (appendix p 4). Finally, an ELISA quantitative antibody test was done on [18 Aug 2020], showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG (34.1 NovaTec Units [NTU]) and IgM (54.2 NTU; both interpreted as positive).

SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing was done using Oxford Nanopore Technologies' MinION, following the ARTIC Network protocols. [5] Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 1st infection variant belonged to clade 20A and lineage B1.p9, whereas the 2nd infection variant belonged to clade 19B and lineage A.1.1 (appendix p 4). The mutation loci and amino acid changes are described in the appendix (p 5)). No shared mutations were observed between the 2 sequences, further suggesting that both variants resulted from distinct evolutionary trajectories.

Although reinfections with coronaviruses that cause the common cold have been reported previously,[6] the symptoms of reinfections are usually milder than those of the primary infections. It was therefore surprising that our patient showed more severe disease with the 2nd infection than with the 1st, especially because the patient did not have any additional clinical conditions that could explain it. Increased severity of 2nd SARS-CoV-2 infections has been reported previously: in a healthy man aged 25 years in Nevada, USA,[2] and in an immunocompromised woman aged 89 years in the Netherlands, which resulted in her death.[4]

The protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is not fully understood; however, protection against severe disease has been shown in animal models and inferred in humans infected with the virus.[7] Interestingly, the antibody test performed during the first infection event showed the presence of specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and no IgG. However, it is not possible to use conventional antibody tests to determine whether a protective immune response developed.

[There continue to be case reports of reinfection with the SARS-CoV-2. In this case, the implicated viruses came from different clades albeit the time between infections was short (approximately 60 days). The virus continues to show us how we are still very much on the upward slope of the learning curve with its impact. Perhaps more in-depth immunologic studies on these individuals may increase our knowledge base. - Mod.MPP]

Data as received by WHO from national authorities, as of 10am CET 22 Nov 2020

Global epidemiological situation
--------------------------------
This past week, the global acceleration in case incidence has slowed down, with around 4 million new cases reported; however, death rates continue to increase with over 67 000 new deaths reported (Figure 1). The European and South East Asia Regions continued downward trends in weekly cases; however, the European Region remains the largest contributor to new cases and new deaths in the past 7 days. The Region of the Americas reported increases in both new cases and new deaths and the Region continues to account for the greatest proportion of cumulative cases and deaths. While case numbers remain relatively low, the African Region reported the highest increase in new cases (15%) and deaths (30%) this week. The Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions also reported an increase in new cases and deaths this week.

As of [22 Nov 2020] there have been over 57.8 million cases and 1.3 million deaths reported globally since the start of the pandemic.

In the past week, the 5 countries reporting the highest number of cases were the United States of America (reporting over 1.1 million cases, a 14% increase from the previous week), India (over 280 000 cases, an 8% decrease), Italy (over 230 000 new cases, a 3% decrease), Brazil (over 200 000 new cases, a 17% increase) and France (over 170 000 new cases, a 16% decrease).

Situation by WHO region
-----------------------
- African Region
In the [African Region], the weekly incidence of new cases reached over 47 000 this week with around 1000 new deaths reported, accounting for 15% and 30% relative increases when compared to the previous week, respectively (Figure 3). The highest new case and death counts were reported in South Africa, Algeria, and Kenya.

In Rwanda this week, cases have increased by 25%, with 226 new cases (17.4 cases per 1 million population) reported. Local authorities are enhancing preventative measures in prisons and detention centres following 3 outbreaks reported in Kigali, Southern and Eastern provinces.

In Zimbabwe, 334 new cases (22.5 cases per 1 million population) were reported this week, with a gradual increase being observed in recent weeks after an initial wave of cases earlier this year [2020]. In Matabeleland Northern Province in the North West of the country, there have been reports of a cluster of confirmed cases affecting approximately 100 students at a boarding school, resulting in the closure of the school. Overall, the country has reported over 9 000 confirmed cases and nearly 300 deaths. The characteristics of the cases show most cases (57%) occur in those aged 20-40 years with a greater proportion of females in older age groups. Deaths are largely occurring in those aged 40-80 years and males account for a greater percentage of deaths in these age groups.

Figure 3: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO African Region, as of [22 Nov 2020]

- Region of the Americas
In the Region of the Americas, the weekly incidence of new cases reached over 1.6 million this week with over 22 000 new deaths reported, accounting for 11% and 15% relative increases when compared to the previous week (Figure 4). The majority of these were reported from the United States of America, with over 1.1 million new cases (9918 cases per 1 million population), followed by Brazil and Mexico.

Cases in the United States of America continue to rise, showing a 14% increase in the past 7 days, while deaths increased by 23%. The 3 states reporting the highest number of cases were Illinois, Texas, and California. With the Thanksgiving holiday on [26 Nov 2020], many states are implementing additional public health and social measures, and the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have discouraged domestic travel. Nonetheless, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screened more than 2 million air passengers on [20 and 21 Nov 2020], in the 2 days after the federal government issued a travel warning and it is estimated that some 50 million Americans may be travelling this Thanksgiving.

On the island of Puerto Rico, relatively low levels of transmission have been sustained over several months with 4600 new cases (91 cases per 1 million population) reported last week. However, weekly deaths have trended upwards in recent weeks, from a low of 26 new deaths/week observed last October [2020], to 90 new deaths reported last week. The highest numbers of cases in the country have been reported in the Metro, Bayamon, and Caguas health regions. Women account for a slightly higher proportion of cases (54%), with an overall median age of 41.5 years.

While Argentina currently accounts for the 3rd-highest number of weekly cases (over 62 000 new cases, 1745 cases per 1 million population) and deaths (around 3200), both new cases and new deaths have been trending downwards since mid-October [2020]. There has, however, been a slight increase in cases in 8 neighborhoods of the Buenos Aires metropolitan area (Balverna, Boca, Colegiales, Constitucion, Nunez, Palermo, Parque Chacabuco, and Vila Urquiza) and cases have stopped decreasing in Cordoba and Rosario; raising concerns that this may signal a broader shift in trend in the coming weeks.

Figure 4: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Region of the Americas, as of [22 Nov 2020]

- Eastern Mediterranean Region
The number of new weekly cases (250 746) and deaths (6299) continues to rise in the Eastern Mediterranean Region, 5% and 10% higher respectively than the previous week (Figure 5). Since August [2020], the number of new weekly cases and deaths has risen in the Region, when fewer than 80 000 new cases and 2500 new deaths were reported per week. Iran, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Iraq, and Lebanon reported the highest numbers of new cases.

The number of new cases in Iraq has declined by 20% over the past week to 16 640 cases (1092 cases per 1 million population). The number of weekly new cases has declined since the week of [19 Oct 2020] when there were 25 629 new cases. The number of new deaths has also declined steadily and Iraq reported an 11% decline from last week to only 302 deaths. WHO concluded a COVID-19 prevention and awareness campaign that targeted approximately 4 million people, including refugees and internally displaced people in the Kurdistan region.

Jordan is reporting 36 800 new cases this week, a 1% rise from last week and the 2nd-highest number of incident cases in the Region (after the Islamic Republic of Iran). The number of new weekly cases has continued to increase since August [2020] when there were fewer than 50 cases reported. Jordan has the highest number of new cases per 1 million population in the Region with 3612 new cases per 1 million. Last week nearly half of the cases were reported from the capital, Amman, followed by Irbid, Aqaba, and Zarqa. Although most cases have been in the 25-34 age group, around 80% of deaths last week were in those aged 55 and over. Jordan also has the highest number of new deaths per 1 million population in the region with 45.9 deaths per 1 million population. The number of weekly deaths has increased since August, but in the past week declined by 11% to 468 new deaths.

The number of new cases in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, increased by 78% last week to 8 430 new cases (1652 cases per 1 million population). This represents the highest number of new cases since the pandemic began, and is higher than the previous peak of over 6200 cases reported in the 3rd week of September [2020]. Gaza remains a pressing concern as itis ill-equipped to face a major spike in cases due to poor living conditions and a fragile healthcare system.

Figure 5: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region, as of [22 Nov 2020]

- European Region
In the past week, the number of new cases reported in the European Region declined by 6% to 1.77 million, after a decline of 10% in the previous week (Figure 6); in a sign that the re-introduction of stricter public health and social measures in a number of countries over the last few weeks is beginning to slow down transmission. Despite this reduction in new cases, the Region still accounts for 44% of global new cases and 49% of global new deaths. New deaths in the Region have continued to rise with 32 684 new deaths reported in the past week.

This week, Italy reported the highest number of new cases in the Region and 3rd-highest globally, with 235 979 new cases (3902 cases per 1 million population); however, cases may have peaked given the slight (3%) decline reported. The number of new deaths increased by 26% to 4578 new deaths (75 deaths per 1 million population). The northern Italy provinces of Valle d'Aosta, Bolzano, and Piemonte report the highest number of cases. Media reports have highlighted concerns of the large number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care, and the growing number of health worker infections, straining local healthcare capacities.

The number of new cases in the United Kingdom fell by 13% from last week to 149 027 new cases (2195 cases per 1 million population), while the number of new deaths remained similar. This decline in new cases represents the 1st weekly decline since late August [2020]. Since [24 Aug 2020], the number of COVID-19 tests conducted daily has increased from 179 000 to 330 000 on [13 Nov 2020] (7-day daily average). The number of patients admitted to hospital has also grown from fewer than 100 per day at the end of August [2020], to 1600 on [14 Nov 2020]; however, this is considerably lower than hospitalizations in early April [2020], when there were over 3000 patients admitted daily. The United Kingdom currently has the 5th-highest number of new cases in the European Region, and the 8th highest number worldwide, however, per capita case incidence remains lower than many other countries in the Region.

Poland reported 152 357 new cases (4026 cases per 1 million population), a 10% fall from last week. The number of new deaths has risen by 35% to 3243 new deaths (or 85 new deaths per 1 million population). Cumulative cases have been highest in the south of Poland, in the provinces of Silesia and Lesser Poland, and in central Poland, in the provinces of Mazowieckie and Greater Poland.

Figure 6: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO European Region, as of [22 Nov 2020]

- South East Asia Region
The South East Asia Region has observed a continued decline in the number of weekly new cases since mid-September [2020] with over 351 000 cases reported, while the number of weekly new deaths has remained at similar levels over the past 4 weeks with 4 706 deaths (Figure 7). The regional trend is largely driven by the decline in cases in India, which comprises 80% of the Region's new weekly cases. Countries with the highest number of weekly new cases were India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Myanmar.

In Myanmar, a 74% increase in cases was observed in the past week, with over 11 000 new cases (204 cases per 1 million population) reported. The number of total new deaths was 188, a 36% increase compared to the previous week. This trend is a change from the decrease in cases observed since the week commencing [12 Oct 2020]. The government has extended the existing COVID-19 prevention measures until the end of November [2020], including the temporary suspension of international and domestic flights. Health authorities are concerned about a potential increase in cases following gatherings which occurred during the recent election and are closely monitoring the situation.

In Sri Lanka, 3580 new cases (167 cases per 1 million population) were reported in the past week, a 29% increase compared to the previous week and the highest number of cases reported in a week since the beginning of the pandemic. The number of new deaths reported was 30, continuing the upward trend in the number of deaths observed in the past 5 weeks. Due to increasing cases, public health and social measures have been introduced. In the Colombo and Gampaha Districts in Western Province, there are movement restrictions in 18 divisions which will be continued in the coming weeks, as well as in 8 districts where restrictions will be lifted this week.

In Bangladesh, a gradual increase in the weekly number of cases observed since October [2020] continued, with over 14 000 new cases (90 cases per 1 million population) in the past week (a 26% increase compared to the previous week). Although there had been a downward trend in deaths since the beginning of September [2020], a 43% increase was reported in the past week with 177 new deaths compared to the previous week. National authorities have closed schools and educational institutions since [17 Mar 2020]. Most school children in Bangladesh do not have access to the internet, so the government is broadcasting lessons on television, and universities are providing classes online. Despite relatively stable testing, the proportion of positive tests has slightly increased over the past month, suggesting an increase in cases and spread of the disease.

Figure 7: Number of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported weekly by the WHO South-East Asia Region, as of [22 Nov 2020]

- Western Pacific Region
Over the past week, the Western Pacific Region recorded over 36 000 cases and 439 deaths. The Region observed a continued increase of cases, with a 9% increase compared to the previous week, while deaths remained stable compared to the previous week. Varying patterns of trends were observed in the Region, where countries including Japan, Republic of Korea, Mongolia, and Australia reported an increase in cases compared to the previous week, whereas countries including the Philippines, French Polynesia, Guam, China, and Singapore observed a decreasing trend. Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, Republic of Korea, and French Polynesia reported the largest number of new weekly reported cases (Figure 8)

Japan reported the largest number of daily cases since the beginning of the outbreak with over 2000 cases reported per day for 5 consecutive days, and 13 502 new cases (107 cases per 1 million population) reported in the past week, a 41% increase from the previous week. There has been a resurgence in cases over the past 3 weeks following a relatively stable number of cases in September and October [2020]. The largest number of daily cases to date were observed in prefectures including Tokyo and surrounding prefectures, Osaka and Hokkaido. The COVID-19 alert level in Tokyo Prefecture has been raised to the red level, which is the highest of the 4 categories. The number of newly reported deaths in the past week was 91, which was an increase by 28%.

Mongolia observed a sharp upward trend with 166 new weekly cases (51 cases per 1 million population), following a period of low levels ranging from 0 to 17 weekly cases from July to October. The number reported this week was more than twice the number reported in the previous week. On [11 Nov 2020], Mongolia reported its 1st case of COVID-19 transmission in the community. Although there have been many imported cases reported, this case in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar was the 1st instance of transmission within the country. Two separate clusters were detected soon after in Selenge province which borders the Russian Federation. One of the clusters in Selenge was traced back to an event in early November [2020], which has led to local clusters with linked cases in the provinces of Darkhan-Uul, Govisumber, Orkhon, and Dornogovi. Mongolia declared a state of emergency on [12 Nov 2020]. No deaths have been reported in Mongolia since the beginning of the pandemic.

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet).

Data by country, area, or territory for 24 Nov 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesNov24_1606267273.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 43.1% of daily case numbers and 23.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 25.0 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Canada, and Argentina. Peru, Chile, and Panama also reported more than 1000 cases. And countries/territories reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Puerto Rico and Paraguay.

[Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours include Pakistan and Madagascar, among others. The number of countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours has rebounded from 53 yesterday (23 Nov 2020) to 59 today (24 Nov 2020) but less than 63 on Friday (20 Nov 2020). In the past 24 hours, the USA (177 833 ), India (44 276), Brazil (33 445), and Poland (32 733) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 744 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (23-24 Nov 2020). Noteworthy is crossing another million mark -- there have been over 60 million cases reported with over 1.4 million deaths.

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include the USA, India, Brazil, Poland, Russia (24 326), Italy (23 227), Sweden (17 265), Germany (16 258), Iran (13 721), Ukraine (12 287), UK (11 299), and Mexico (10 794). The USA will cross the 13 million case mark in the next 24 hours, and Germany will cross the 1 million case mark later on this week if transmission continues at the same level in both countries.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts are virtually stable having increased by 0.60%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 11.7%. In the USA, representing 30.3% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, the comparative 7-day averages show a 10.8% increase in confirmed cases and a 37.6% increase in daily reported deaths.

Impression: The comparative 7-day averages show a possible leveling off in daily reported cases but a continued increase in reported deaths. The USA shows continued uncontrolled transmission. - Mod.MPP]
