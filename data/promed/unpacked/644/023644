Rabies control programs will be successful in countries of Indian
subcontinent by following these measures.
As Dr. Oscar has put it rightly, first a political will is needed.
Ironically, it is public health experts of a country who have to make a
strong case to the politicians. They should be armed with a surveillance
data. Surveillance is poor for most diseases!
For control of the dog population, an alloy of the following measures are
obligatory. Sterilization of male and female dogs on a large scale. Here
animal right groups have to agree and support this movement, as euthanasia
of dogs is a sensitive issue.
Along with this a combination of vaccine baits and injectable vaccines are
needed. Only one will not do. There is a variation in dog behavior when an
approach is made to them for vaccination. All pets can be vaccinated
easily, but for that a strong legislation is needed. Although if pet owners
are educated then in most cases they get their pet vaccinated.
Dr. Pandey's letter creates doubt with regard to the efficacy of sheep
brain phenolized killed vaccine. In a control program, economic feasibility
study should be given priority. Rabipur and other TCV are available only in
cities like Kathmandu. They are certainly very costly.
When I worked as a veterinary surgeon in a remote village of the Rajasthan
state of India, I saw a man die of a dog bite because he took it casually.
Without education of the public, any control program will fail.
Even if control measures are followed strictly and comprehensively then
action will shift to wild and sylvatic canines. A follow up of control
programs and regular monitoring will need to be in place.
Finally for Nepal, what about the border with India? A rabies control
program in conjunction with Bihar State (Bordering Nepal) and Uttar Pradesh
will be more effective.
