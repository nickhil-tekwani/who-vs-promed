Farmers are being advised to keep a look out for tick infestations and treat animals promptly, following abnormally high numbers of sheep ticks being blamed for lamb deaths in parts of the UK. It is unusual for ticks to be a problem before May, but dry and sunny weather conditions this spring [2015] appear to have accelerated infestations.

Sally Harmer, animal health specialist at Clynderwen [Carmarthenshire County] and Cardiganshire [Ceredigion] Farmers, says several farms in north and mid Wales are reporting an unusually high level of sheep tick infestations. "Some lamb deaths have been reported due to the large numbers of ticks causing severe anaemia," she says. "Lambs are more at risk than older sheep, because the older animals do develop some immunity, but anything can get bitten and infected."

One farmer whose flock has been badly hit is JR, of Bwlchyddwyallt, Tregaron [Ceredigion]. 10 days after turning out a group of New Zealand Romney hoggets on to the hill their health deteriorated. "Their condition nose-dived, they were very weak," says JR, whose land rises to 300 m (1000 ft). "We brought them in and found they have large numbers of ticks around their jaws and necks. It really knocked them for 6." Mr JR quickly treated the group, but it was too late to save one of the animals.

As part of its lifecycle, the sheep tick needs a blood meal from a host animal. Adult females are most likely to be found attached to the head, legs or other areas of skin not covered by wool. Their feeding can also cause abscesses in the joints, spine, and internal organs of lambs, leading to a condition known as tick pyaemia [septicemia in which secondary foci of suppuration occur and multiple abscesses are formed].

Tickborne fever, an illness characterised by a sudden high fever for between 4 and 22 days, can be a problem in some areas. Ticks also transmit louping ill -- a viral disease of the nervous system -- which can cause high mortality. The disease affects the brain and symptoms include poor coordination, paralysis and convulsions.

Mr Rees believes his New Zealand Romneys, which had been bought in, could have been affected because they hadn't previously been exposed to ticks. "There were some of my neighbour's sheep mixed in with them -- hardy, small Welsh ewes -- and they didn't have a tick on them," he says. Although he experienced problems with ticks a few years ago, he recalls that infestation was later in the year. "I wouldn't expect to see ticks this early in the season," he admits. Ticks are inactive in the winter and only start seeking a host when the mean maximum weekly temperature exceeds 7 deg C [44.6 deg F].

Ms Harmer advises farmers to treat their flocks promptly to prevent losses, especially in flocks on rough and unimproved pastures where the natural increase in numbers coincides with the turnout of ewes and young lambs. "Cypermethrin and alphacypermethrin can be used to treat and prevent ticks in flocks," she says. "Both prevent and treat blowfly but should not be used in lambs under one week of age." Deltamethrin can also be used, but has no blowfly recommendation. "Organophosphate sheep dips are also effective in preventing and controlling ticks; however these are not licenced for use in showers or jetters," says Ms Harmer.

[Ticks can have significant effects on sheep welfare, production, and health. There are several tick species in the UK; the most prevalent and most important vector of disease-causing pathogens in UK and Europe is the species _Ixodes ricinus_. This tick has a 3-year life cycle; eggs, larvae, nymph, and adult. Each stage requires one blood meal. They have been increasing in Britain in recent decades. Ticks are inactive in the winter and only start questing for a host when the mean maximum weekly temperature exceeds 7 deg C (44.6 deg F).

Although the "health deterioration" of the New Zealand Romney hoggets, described above, could have been caused by anemia due to the feeding of large number of ticks on the animals, the cause of the mentioned disease and mortality deserves to be thoroughly investigated.

These ticks may transmit in sheep 3 important diseases:
1. Louping ill -- a viral disease, its symptoms being wobbly gait, trembling, seizures, or even sudden death.
2. Lamb pyaemia ("cripples") -- resulting from bacterially (such as staphylococci) infected tick bites, can cause lameness, paralysis, ill thrift, and death in young lambs.
3. Tickborne fever (TBF) -- causes by the rickettsia _Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, which causes reduced immunity (respiratory/joint infections) and reproductive problems (see reference). _A. phagocytophilum_ can infect not only sheep but is shown to also infect cattle, goats, horses, dogs, cats, moose, reed deer, roe deer, rodents and humans (causing human granulocytic anaplasmosis).
