Sources of information on treatment of smallpox cases
-----------------------------------------------------
Interesting hypothesis and questions. A possible resource would be the
Chemical Casualty Care Division, US Army Medical Research Institute of
Chemical Defense, Aberdeen, MD. Their website is accessible at
<http://ccc.apgea.army.mil>. From there, go to their contact link. They
work directly with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on
many of these issues and may be able to help answer these questions.
Another resource is the CDC Emergency Preparedness and Response Cell
Emergency Operations Div, phone number 770 488 7100. This is a 24hr number.

Possible application of interferon-gamma in treatment
-----------------------------------------------------
With respect to inhibition of smallpox infection, like many other DNA and
RNA viruses studied, the poxvirus _Vaccinia virus_, at least (and all
herpesviruses) are sensitive to nitric oxide (1-5). [There are presumably
no data available relating directly to _Variola virus_ (smallpox virus). -
Mod.CP
Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by NO synthase which has different isoforms
in different tissues. All of these isoforms are induced by inflammatory
cytokines such as Interleukin-12, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (1,6). While excessive activation of NO release might lead to
hypotension, this could be monitored and treated. Therefore consideration
should be given to administration of IFN-gamma to smallpox patients.

Fever in smallpox
-----------------
William Baine raises the question of fever and the outcome of smallpox. It
could be helpful to read what Christie had to say (AB Christie (editor).
Infectious diseases: epidemiology and clinical practice. Edinburgh &
London: Livingstone, 1969). On page 198 he refers to the onset of the
disease: "The temperature reaches its height by the second day; 103 F (39.4
C) is commonly found, but it may rise to 104 or 105 F (40 or 40.5 C) even
in cases that are not to prove unduly severe." On p. 201: " The amount of
fever and the severity of the symptoms are proportional to the profuseness
of the rash... " In the gravely ill patient, the fever continues, the rash,
instead of forming dry scabs, becomes slimy and forms foul sloughs, the
patient's condition becomes more and more wretched till death occurs...".
Christie's classic textbook was written by himself alone, based on his
extremely vast experience as a clinician and a public health officer of
many years experience. He wrote only on diseases with which he had solid
personal experience and observations. He held a special appointment, among
many others, of consultant on smallpox, Ministry of Health in England when
smallpox was still very common in many countries.

[These are interesting observations and discussions. Among other things,
however, they do not answer the question posed by Dr Baine. This thread is
straying away from the original subject, that is, the US response plan in
the event of bioterrorist attack, which is concerned predominantly with
containment by vaccination. Termination is imminent. - Mod.CP
