Health Surveillance for airline passengers
-------------------
A spokesman for the Department of Health (DH) 25 Mar 2003 called on members
of the public who had travelled from Hong Kong to Beijing in flight CA 112
on 15 Mar 2003 or from Beijing to Hong Kong in flight CA 115 on 19 Mar 2003
to call DH's hotline 2961 8968 for health advice.
The plea follows the detection of 9 atypical pneumonia cases among members
of a Beijing tour organized by a Hong Kong travel agent.
The tour comprised 35 tour members and a staff member of the travel agent.
They left for Beijing in flight CA 112 on 15 Mar 2003 and returned to Hong
Kong in flight CA 115 on 19 Mar 2003.
Investigation revealed that a couple who joined the tour, both aged 44, had
developed symptoms during their stay in Beijing on 18 Mar 2003. They were
admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital on the evening of 22 Mar 2003 and are now in
stable condition.
On receiving the notification on 23 Mar 2003, DH immediately contacted
other members of the tour. Among them 3, one man and 2 women aged between
27 and 50, were also confirmed to have developed atypical pneumonia
symptoms. They were admitted to Tuen Mun Hospital and Pamela Youde
Nethersole Eastern Hospital for treatment. They are in stable condition.
6 other members of the tour who had been reported to have coughs, 3 men and
3 women aged between 32 and 61, were admitted to hospitals for close
surveillance earlier. Four of them, comprising 2 men and 2 women aged
between 32 and 51, were confirmed today to have infected with atypical
pneumonia. They are receiving treatment in Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The
fifth person, a 61-year-old man, is still under observation in Tuen Mun
Hospital. The sixth person, a 48-year-old woman, was discharged yesterday.
It is suspected that the couple contracted the disease from a passenger, a
man aged 73, who sat close to them on their way to Beijing. The man was
feeling unwell after visiting his brother in Ward 8A of Prince of Wales
Hospital earlier this month.
DH has informed the Airport Authority, the Civil Aviation Department and
the airline concerned. Advice was also given to the airline concerned to
disinfect the airplanes.
DH is tracing the crew members and passengers who had taken these two
flights, for surveillance purposes.
The spokesman reminded members of the public who have respiratory symptoms
including fever, chills, malaise and cough to avoid traveling by plane
before recovery.
It is prudent for tourists to adopt the following precautionary measures to
prevent atypical pneumonia:
Build up good body immunity by having a proper diet, regular exercise and
adequate rest, reducing stress and avoiding smoking;
Maintain good personal hygiene, and wash hands after sneezing, coughing or
cleaning the nose;
Maintain good ventilation; avoid visiting crowded places with poor ventilation;
Do not share towels;
Consult a doctor promptly if you develop respiratory symptoms and fever.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) multi-country outbreak - Update 9
Updated travel advice
On 15 Mar 2003, WHO issued a travel advisory in response to the growing
international threat posed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
Since then, WHO has conducted daily teleconferences with health authorities
and WHO team members on the scene in all areas affected by SARS.
WHO also receives detailed bulletins from ministries of health in the most
heavily affected areas reporting on any SARS-related events that might
alter understanding of the behaviour of this new disease.
Today's communications included a report, from the Hong Kong department of
health, providing detailed preliminary data on the detection of 9 atypical
pneumonia cases among members of a Beijing tour organized by a Hong Kong
travel agent. Investigation of these cases, including tentative
identification of the index case, has progressed rapidly. The Hong Kong
department of health is tracing, for surveillance purposes, the crew
members and passengers who had taken 2 flights. The general public has been
informed and a hot-line has been set up.
WHO epidemiologists in Geneva, together with experts tracking outbreaks in
affected countries, have decided today that, based on the information
available at present, there is no need to change previous WHO advice.
WHO continues to recommend no travel restrictions to any destination. WHO
advises travellers to remain alert to the symptoms of SARS. These include
high fever, respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and
difficulty breathing, and should report these symptoms promptly.
As of today, 487 SARS cases have been reported from 12 countries.
A number of persons with SARS have taken long distance flights after
becoming ill. Thousands of passengers who travelled in the same flights
have been traced in Germany, Canada, Singapore and the United States. No
cases have been discovered among these contacts. Today's report of a
possible transmission of SARS on board a flight is undergoing
investigation. As "close" contact is possible during a flight, in
passengers sitting close to an infected person, such transmission cannot be
ruled out. The evidence to date indicates that in-flight transmission is
very unusual.
Health authorities and hospital staff the world over are now alert to the
symptoms of SARS. Suspect cases are being quickly detected and promptly
reported. Proper isolation and management of cases has greatly reduced the
risk of transmission of newly detected cases to others.
WHO advice to travellers is being kept under constant review. SARS is an
emerging disease. Knowledge about is clinical behaviour, response to
treatment, and modes and risks of transmission are continually evolving.
WHO is confident that, in the present climate of heightened awareness and
rapid and detailed reporting, data useful in understanding SARS and issuing
sound public health advice are being rapidly collected and rapidly made
available.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank subscriber John Herbert
<j_a_herbert@yahoo.com> for sending information following a radio
announcement on this advisory.
According to the very thorough investigation of the cases as presented
above, it appears as though the transmission would still qualify as "close
contact" with the chain of transmission being sitting close to an infected
individual on a plane, and then being a member of a tour group that spends
hours together on a daily basis for multiple days. We await further
information from the investigation of this event. - Mod.MPP]
