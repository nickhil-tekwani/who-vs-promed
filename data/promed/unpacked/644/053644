An official communication by the CVO on the 8th ASF case in wild boar on Polish territory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On 10 Jul 2014, an 8th case of African swine fever (ASF) in wild boar in Poland has been confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory for African swine fever (the National Veterinary Research Institute).

Infection with ASF virus has been confirmed in a dead wild boar that was found in a forest area located in the municipality of Grodek (Bialystok County, Podlaskie Voivodeship), approximately 1.5 km [about 0.9 mile] from the nearest village of Wiejki and approximately 6 km [about 3.7 miles] from the border between Poland and Belarus.

Sample for ASF was collected from the wild boar on 8 Jul 2014 and was sent to the NVRI in the framework of the national ASF surveillance programme. In accordance with the results of laboratory tests performed by the NVRI and received on 10 Jul 2014, the RT-PCR test produced positive results.

The 8th case of ASF in wild boar has been confirmed -- as the previous 7 cases -- in the vicinity of the border, within the area indicated in Part II of the Annex to Commission Implementing Decision 2014/178/EU, and therefore subject to proper restrictions.
