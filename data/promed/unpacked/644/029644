2nd bird flu confirmed
----------------------
Another outbreak of bird flu was confirmed at a duck farm in South
Jeolla Province, Friday [7 Jan 2011]. The government said ducks at
the farm in Yeongam tested positive for the virulent strain of the
H5N1 avian influenza.

This comes just one week after outbreaks of the highly contagious
bird disease in Iksan, North Jeolla Province, and Cheonan, North
Chungcheong Province, on 31 Dec 2010, raising concerns that the
disease may be spreading across the country.

The country has already been grappling for more than 2 months with
the fast-spreading foot-and-mouth disease.

Quarantine officials said initial on-site tests confirmed that the
ducks in the latest case were infected with the H5N1 strain. All 14
500 birds on the farm and 84 400 birds on 4 other farms within a
500-meter radius from the outbreak have been ordered to be culled as
a precautionary measure.

South Korea had been hit by avian influenza 3 times before.
