An egg recall has expanded to more than half a billion eggs, and
federal officials say 2000 illnesses have been reported connected to
the salmonellosis outbreak.

Eggs from an Iowa producer linked to an outbreak of salmonellosis had
sparked a nationwide egg recall this past week. That has expanded to
a 2nd egg producer, Hillandale Farms. The firms sold eggs to
wholesalers and distributors in numerous states, and the eggs were
distributed nationwide.

The CDC issued the following guidelines for consumers:
-Don't eat recalled eggs or products containing recalled eggs.
Recalled eggs might still be in grocery stores, restaurants, and
consumers' homes.
-Consumers who have recalled eggs should discard them or return them
to their retailer for a refund.
-Individuals who think they might have become ill from eating
recalled eggs should consult their health care providers.
-Keep eggs refrigerated at all times.
-Discard cracked or dirty eggs.
-Wash hands, cooking utensils, and food preparation surfaces with
soap and water after contact with raw eggs.
-Eggs should be cooked until both the white and the yolk are firm and
eaten promptly after cooking.
-Do not keep eggs warm or at room temperature for more than 2 hours.
-Refrigerate unused or leftover egg-containing foods promptly.
-Avoid eating raw eggs.
-Avoid restaurant dishes made with raw or undercooked, unpasteurized
eggs. Restaurants should use pasteurized eggs in any recipe (such as
Hollandaise sauce or Caesar salad dressing) that calls for raw eggs.
-Consumption of raw or undercooked eggs should be avoided, especially
by young children, elderly persons, and persons with weakened immune
systems or debilitating illness.
