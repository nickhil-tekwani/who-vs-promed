Fatal Illnesses Associated With a New World Arenavirus - California, 1999-2000
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The California Department of Health Services (CDHS) and the University of
Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) recently identified evidence of infection with
an arenavirus in three patients hospitalized with similar fatal illnesses.
This report summarizes the investigation of these cases.
Patients had onset of illness during June 1999-May 2000. They were aged 14,
30, and 52 years; all were female. Two resided in southern California and
the third in the San Francisco Bay area. The patients did not have any
activities in common, and none had a history of travel outside California
during the 4 weeks preceding their illness. Illnesses were associated with
nonspecific febrile symptoms including fever, headache, and myalgias.
Within the first week of hospitalization, lymphopenia (25-700 per mm3) was
observed in all 3 patients, and thrombocytopenia (30,000-40,000 per mm3)
was seen in 2. All 3 patients had acute respiratory distress syndrome and 2
developed liver failure and hemorrhagic manifestations. All patients died
1-8 weeks after illness onset. Arenavirus-specific RNA was detected in one
or more materials from each patient using a nested RT-PCR assay. In
addition, infectious arenavirus was recovered from materials from the
14-year-old patient by cultivation of the virus in monolayer cultures of
Vero E6 cells; virus isolation attempts on materials from the 30-year-old
patient are under way. The nucleotide sequence of the PCR products
amplified from the patients essentially were identical and shared 87%
identity with the Whitewater Arroyo (WWA) virus, prototype strain.
[Whitewater Arroyo virus is a novel arenavirus recovered from a _Neotoma
albigula_, the white-throated woodrat, from Whitewater Arroyo in McKinley
County, New Mexico in the early 1990s -Mod.CP. Serologic assays (indirect
fluorescent antibody assay and IgG enzyme immunoassay) for arenavirus
antibody were negative for all three patients.
Family members of the three patients were interviewed about activities and
potential exposure sites during the month before illness onset. One patient
reportedly cleaned rodent droppings in her home during the 2 weeks before
illness onset; no history of rodent contact was solicited for the other 2
patients.

[Arenaviruses are rodent-borne enveloped negative-stranded RNA viruses.
Viruses classified in the family _Arenaviridae_ cause viral hemorrhagic
fever syndromes in Africa and South America and one virus that causes
aseptic meningitis. The Old World arenaviruses include Lassa fever virus
and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus. The latter is associated with the
house mouse (_Mus musculus_), and is the only Old World arenavirus that
occurs in the Americas where it is an infrequent cause of aseptic
meningitis in humans. The South American hemorrhagic fever viruses belong
to the Tacaribe complex or New World arenaviruses (e.g., Guanarito, Junin,
Machupo, and Sabia viruses). Prior to the isolation of Whitewater Arroyo
virus, the sole New World arenavirus known to be indigenous to North
America was Tamiami virus found only in Southern Florida where its primary
host is the cotton rat _Sigmodon hispidus_. Phylogenetic analysis of
nucleocapsid protein gene sequence data indicates that Tamiami virus is the
new world arenavirus most closely related to Whitewater Arroyo virus.
An addendum to the MMWR Report states that WWA virus is found in North
America among woodrats (_Neotoma_ spp.)and has not previously been known to
cause disease in humans. Of 20 _Neotoma_ spp. with species status, 9 occur
in the United States. The geographic range of these species incorporates
most of the United States. At least 5 of the 9 U.S. species may harbor the
virus; however, complete description of its distribution requires further
study. The abundance and habits of woodrats suggest that potential contact
between _Neotoma_ spp. and humans is limited.
The Addendum also states that CDHS and UTMB, in cooperation with CDC and
other agencies, are continuing to investigate these 3 cases. A
determination of the spectrum of illness with WWA will require increased
clinical surveillance and community studies to define a precise
disease-to-infection ratio and case fatality. Appropriate laboratory
diagnostic tests are being developed to support these efforts. In clinical
specimens, the virus is either present in low concentrations or is
difficult to isolate with methods commonly used for other arenaviruses.
Efforts are under way to evaluate whether specific detection of virus
antigens in blood or tissues, presence of specific IgM in the serum of
patients, or postmortem diagnostic tests (e.g., immunohistochemistry) can
be added to virus isolation and RT-PCR for laboratory diagnosis of
infection with this virus. - Mod.CP
