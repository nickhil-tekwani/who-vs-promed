5 Dec 2022 marked 80 days of responding to the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Uganda and 7 days since the last confirmed case in one of the worst hit districts called Kasanda. A total of 36 contacts were actively being followed-up in 4 districts, a follow-up rate of 100% in the past 24 hours.

That was a huge relief from mid-to-late October [2022] when up to 10 new cases were being reported every day.

Further good news was that 8 of the 9 districts that had registered Ebola cases had not recorded any new case in the last 21 days. Kagadi district had not registered a new case in over 67 days, Bunyangabo in 66, Kyegegwa in 37, Masaka in 33, and the rest in over 21 days.

The World Health Organisation says for an area to be declared Ebola-free, it should spend 42 days (2 21-day incubation cycles of the virus) without any new cases reported.

That means that Uganda is not yet Ebola free. On 5 Dec 2022, 14 safe and dignified burials of Ebola fatalities were conducted in Mubende and Kassanda and total alerts validated from districts with active contacts within the past 24-hours were 436, of which 42 met the suspected case definition and 16 were evacuated.

But the Minister of Health, Dr Jane Ruth Aceng has said that if no new case is reported by 17 Dec 2022, then the country will be on the journey to be declared Ebola-free.

On 20 Sep 2022, the Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of _Sudan ebolavirus_ (SVD) after a case managed at Mubende Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in Mubende district was confirmed through testing at the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI). This followed investigations by the National Rapid Response Team of suspicious deaths that had occurred in the district earlier in the month. This is the 1st time in more than a decade that Uganda reports an outbreak of _Sudan ebolavirus_.

But on 1 Dec 2022, Uganda also announced that all Ebola beds are empty as the last known patient of the Ebola disease had recovered and been discharged from a hospital. Health officials said they hoped that signals that the spread of the virus has slowed dramatically, if not stopped altogether.

"Happy to announce that we discharged the last Ebola patient," said the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health, Dr Diana Atwine, on Twitter, "God has seen us though this epidemic."

The last batch of 4 patients were all at Mubende Hospital. They included 3 women and a 1-year-old baby.

Dr Paskar Apiyo, a consultant physician heading the Mubende Ebola Treatment team said discharging the patients was a milestone.

Mubende Hospital registered 111 Ebola disease patients of whom 62 recovered and 49 died. This was seen as a positive achievement. "With the experience we have attained here in Mubende, I think if there is another Ebola outbreak in Uganda, more people are going to survive. We are going to write what has been here and it will change the story about Ebola," said Immaculate Atuhaire.

But, according to some reports, this aggressive containment effort that led to the waning of the outbreak also means a quickly arranged trial of experimental ebolavirus vaccines faces formidable hurdles.

A report by Jon Cohen, Senior Correspondent for the journal 'Science', said the goal of the so-called ring trial is to test the efficacy of the vaccines by giving them to contacts of known cases but the number of potential participants is dwindling fast.

"The plan was to start the trial as soon as early December, but it may have to be called off or redesigned," Cohen wrote, "The issue is sensitive, given the amount of effort put into securing vaccines."

He said roughly USD 9 million (about Shs 33 billion) in funding for the trial had been raised and necessary permits obtained.

He said multiple people close to the study -- including 3 Ugandan researchers -- refused to speak on the record about the prospects for rolling out the trial vaccines.

But, he added, Mark Feinberg, who heads International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), a New York City-based nonprofit that has the rights to a _Sudan ebolavirus_ vaccine, had said, "Whether the study will start or not I think is an open question."

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), as of 25 Nov 2022, Uganda had 141 confirmed cases, 55 of whom had died. WHO tallies include another 22 deaths as likely due to the virus, which had spread, alarmingly, to Kampala, the heavily populated capital.

The last confirmed case was diagnosed on 13 Nov 2022, save for a stillborn baby on 27 Nov whose mother had already recovered. After 42 days have passed without a case, the outbreak officially will have ended.

But epidemiologist Mike Ryan, director of WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, cautioned at a press conference in early December that there were still "significant gaps in tracing some of the chains of transmission," which means new cases and their contacts may soon surface.

"Ebola always has a sting in its tail," he said.

Chance to test vaccine
----------------------
Researchers had hoped for a chance to test new Ebola vaccines. A vaccine has been approved since 2019 for the _Zaire ebolavirus_, which has caused multiple outbreaks in several countries, including a widespread epidemic in West Africa that ran from 2013-2016. But monkey studies suggest that vaccine will not work against the genetically distinct _Sudan ebolavirus_ behind this Uganda outbreak.

In October 2022, when Dr Aceng announced that healthcare workers were already testing some new Sudan Ebola treatment options and that 3 vaccine candidates would be evaluated in the coming weeks, she revealed some details.

She said the initial plan is to gauge efficacy in primary Ebola contacts within 29 days of exposure, with a goal of immunising contacts of 150 confirmed Ebola patients, which would be about 3000 contacts. She said the trial plans have been finalised and that trials would likely begin in mid-November.

The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he welcomed Uganda's vaccine trial announcement. He added that involving Uganda's researchers is key to building capacities for safe and effective vaccinations.

When the new Ebola cases surfaced, several vaccines for the _Sudan ebolavirus_ were in development, and Ugandan health officials on 2 Dec 2022, approved testing 3 candidates. But at the start of the outbreak no manufacturer had enough doses in vials to ship.

The 3 candidate vaccines recommended for the trial by an independent WHO expert panel include Sabin Vaccine Institute's ChAd3-SUDV, cAdOx1 biEBOV from Oxford University/Jenner Institute/Serum Institute of India and Merck/IAVI's SV-SUDV.

To start phase 3 trials in Guinea during the West Africa Ebola outbreak in 2015, it was 7 months from declaration to arrival of vaccines. This was a great achievement and set historical records at the time. That trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of vaccines against the _Zaire ebolavirus_ -- the one responsible for the West Africa outbreak and more recently, outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But there are no licensed vaccines against the _Sudan ebolavirus_ species responsible for the current outbreak in Uganda, thus the need for the current trial.

The trial is led by Uganda's Makerere University and co-sponsored by the Ministry of Health and WHO. WHO worked with the Ugandan government and researchers to design the protocol for the trial, ensure regulatory and ethical processes were speedy, to train research teams and to install the cold chain that will preserve the vaccines at optimal temperature.

Prof Bruce Kirenga, the Principal Investigator for the vaccine trial, said 9 research teams had been recruited and trained ready to be deployed in the districts where the trial will take place.

"We hope that through the trial we will provide sufficient information to know how effective one or more of the candidate vaccines are, although it will take time to gather quality data," Dr Yonas Tegegn Woldemariam, the WHO Representative in Uganda. "We are working hand in hand with all partners involved to ensure that the trial will be delivered to high scientific and ethical standards."

At the time of Cohen's writing, doses of vaccines developed by the nonprofit Sabin Vaccine Institute and, separately the University of Oxford were expected to arrive in Uganda in a few days.

Cohen said an expert committee organised by WHO says the most promising of the vaccines, originally developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada before being taken up by Merck and then licensed to IAVI, has lagged farther behind because company did not realise until nearly a month into the current outbreak that it had 100 000 old but viable doses frozen in bulk supplies.

"The vaccines may arrive too late to assess their worth, however," Cohen wrote, "To be eligible for the ring trial, participants must have been exposed to an infected person within 21 days. As of week 2 of December 2022, only a few hundred people -- about 20 per case -- remain eligible. Without new cases, that number decreases each day."

Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo, WHO's main representative helping organise the study, said at the early December 2022 press conference the trial was "imminent" but had no set launch date.

Even if the ring trial does not launch, Feinberg says he hopes Uganda will stage a phase 1 safety study of the IAVI/Merck vaccine -- most likely in healthcare workers. If it triggers immune responses that mirror the ones seen with the successful _Zaire ebolavirus_ vaccine, the new data, combined with studies that show immunised monkeys have solid protection against the virus, could persuade regulators to approve it for use in future outbreaks.

The Uganda outbreak highlights the need for a more streamlined outbreak response system. "People got these doses together really, really quickly," says Nicole Lurie, US director for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations -- but perhaps not fast enough to save lives. "We need a reserve of (investigational) vaccines so they'll be at the ready for the next outbreak," she says.

One answer, says Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, is to stockpile experimental vaccines on the continent -- for Ebola and other emerging diseases -- and agree on trial protocols ahead of time. "We have to crack this," he says, noting that to store COVID-19 vaccines GAVI supplied Uganda and many lower income countries with -80 deg C [-112 deg F] freezers that could be repurposed for other vaccine stockpiles.

Berkley acknowledges that creating and maintaining stockpiles would cost money, and it also means periodically throwing away vaccines that expire and replacing them. Still, he says, "It would have been awfully nice to have had 100 000 doses ready to go at the start of this outbreak. That's where I think we have to go next."

[It is a dilemma that has been experienced before that just as a vaccine trial is about to start, there are too few cases for statistical significance. But it is wonderful news that the cases have dropped off. The vaccine trial will be able to inform safety and immunogenicity and that is important information to gather before there is another outbreak of _Sudan Ebolavirus_. How protective the vaccine is cannot be tested effectively with so few cases, but this trial will be a significant start. - Mod.LK]

[2] _Zaire ebolavirus_ vaccine: safety, immunogenicity
Date: Wed 14 Dec 2022
Source: Medical Xpress [edited]
https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-12-trial-safety-immunogenicity-ebola-vaccines.html

Ebola epidemics occur periodically in various sub-Saharan African countries. While vaccines exist and have already received WHO Prequalification against the _Zaire ebolavirus_ species, it is essential to pursue and intensify efforts to supplement the available data to develop a safe and effective Ebola vaccine strategies in adults and children alike.

The PREVAC international consortium, which includes scientists from Inserm and from institutions in Africa, US, and UK, has published the results of a large-scale randomized clinical trial in West Africa in the New England Journal of Medicine [see citation below]. These results confirm the safety of 3 different vaccine regimens, and suggest that an immune response is induced and maintained for up to 12 months.

In a context where many sub-Saharan African countries regularly face Ebola outbreaks, vaccines are seen as a central tool to fight the spread of the disease. Since 2019, two vaccines have obtained WHO Prequalification against the _Zaire ebolavirus_ species: the vaccine rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP developed by Merck, Sharpe & Dohme, Corp., and the Ad26.ZEBOV and MVA-BN-Filo vaccine regimen from Johnson & Johnson.

Beyond these advances, research on Ebola vaccines must continue. Indeed, additional data are needed in order to establish the most appropriate recommendations regarding the use of these vaccines, in different categories of the population.

3 vaccine regimens tested
-------------------------
This is the goal of the PREVAC international consortium. Starting in 2017, a vast, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial mobilized African, European, and US research teams working together in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Mali. It is one of the largest Ebola vaccination trials to date -- conducted with both adults and children aged 1 year and older.

The trial aimed to measure the rapidity, intensity, and durability of the immune responses generated by 3 different Ebola vaccine regimens, involving the vaccines mentioned above. It also evaluated the safety and tolerability of the various products administered.

- The 1st vaccine regimen tested consisted of injecting one dose of Ad26.ZEBOV followed 56 days later by one dose of MVA-BN-Filo.
- The 2nd regimen consisted of injecting one dose of rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP.
- Finally, the 3rd regimen started with one dose of rVSVdeltaG-ZEBOV-GP followed 56 days later with the same vaccine as a booster.

In total, the trial included 1400 adults and 1401 children between 1 and 17 years of age, who were randomized into several groups to test and compare the 3 regimens versus placebo.

The data obtained suggest that all 3 regimens are safe and well-tolerated in adults and children. After vaccination and within the 7 days that followed, the majority of the participants reported pain at the injection site and other minor symptoms (fever, muscle and joint pain, headache, etc.), which generally disappeared after 7 days.

The 3 regimens also generated a rapid increase, after 14 days, of the amount of antibodies directed against the virus, with a peak at between 1 and 3 months after the 1st vaccination. While it's not yet possible to say whether this immune response prevents infection, current scientific literature suggests a strong correlation between the amount of these antibodies and the level of protection against the virus. These antibodies were detected up to 12 months after the 1st injection.

"The data collected during this clinical trial are valuable because they help confirm the safety and potential efficacy of the available vaccines, making it possible to refine the vaccination recommendations during both _Zaire ebolavirus_ epidemic and inter-epidemic periods, in populations at risk," explains the trial's principal investigator, Yazdan Yazdanpanah.

"This trial is marked by a high participant retention rate thanks to the unwavering involvement of all the professionals in the field, and the population's adherence to the research that led to these results," explains principal investigator Mark Kieh.

"The PREVAC trial is a real example of success for international research in emerging and re-emerging infections. We show that with solid collaboration founded on strong partnerships, we can advance Ebola research in the areas of the world most affected by the disease," says H Clifford Lane, NIAID Deputy Director for Clinical Research and Special Projects.

Also see Jeremy Faust (https://insidemedicine.substack.com/p/new-ebola-vaccination-study-looks):
"Because this trial was done during a time when Ebola was not circulating in the population or places studied, no cases were detected. So, we do not know how many cases would have been prevented if an outbreak had occurred. But earlier work gives scientists a pretty good idea that antibody titers above 200 units per milliliter are likely to provide clinically relevant protection (that's based on non-human primate research). In this study, the vaccine responders (that is, most of the participants) were found to have far higher levels than the 200 units/mL cutoff, often in the thousands range. Their levels peaked 1-3 months after vaccination, and waned somewhat by one year."

I reached out to the lead author of the study, Dr Yazdan Yazdanpanah. He confirmed that the study contains "no information on correlations between antibody titer levels and disease outcome. That said, the study never sought to do that. While vaccine efficacy against infection, severe disease, or death would be nice to have, these data are adequate to move ahead with. The news is just what we were hoping for."] - Mod.LK
