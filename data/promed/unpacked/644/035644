The incidence of dengue fever in this city has been stabilized 2
weeks after the implementation of anti-dengue initiatives by the City
Health Office (CHO).
City health officer Dr. Rodel Agbulos said the number of dengue
admissions in hospitals decreased to 10 per week from 15 a week after
the "Dengue Noise Barrage" and heightened information and education
campaign were conducted.
Although lower than the previous weeks, Agbulos said the weekly
dengue cases are still higher than the average 8 cases per week
during the same time last year [2006].
Since January up to the 1st week of April this year [2007], 154
dengue patients were admitted in hospitals in this city, Agbulos said.
He noted this number is 57 per cent higher than the reported dengue
cases during the same period last year [2006].
Agbulos advised the public to continue their anti-dengue efforts,
like environmental sanitation, covering and weekly cleaning of water
containers, collection and disposal of all unusable tin cans, jars,
bottles and other items that can collect and hold water and cleaning
roof gutters of debris and leaves.
Agbulos said health officials were prompted to declare a dengue alert
and undertake anti-dengue initiatives after they noted a gradual
increase in the number of cases in the past 6 weeks.
The city health office, in coordination with barangay officials, held
last month [March 2007] a simultaneous noise barrage and massive
clean up activities in 8 barangays [political subdivisions of the
city. - Mod.TY] where the most numbers of dengue cases came from.
Agbulos stressed that the effort to minimize if not eradicate dengue
fever requires public support and cooperation.

[Although cleanup campaigns are an important measure to eliminate
vector breeding sites quickly and reduce dengue virus transmission,
the long term challenge will be to change human behavior to maintain
the area clean enough to permanently reduce _Aedes aegypti_ populations.

The Healthcare and Nutrition Ministry warns that mosquito breeding
will increase with the heavy rains experienced during this New Year
season, leading to the spread of dengue, chikungunya and other
mosquito-borne diseases.
There were 15 000 dengue cases in 2004/2005, the highest ever number
of dengue cases reported.
The main reason was heavy rain. This year [2007] too the situation is
similar, Healthcare and Nutrition Ministry sources said.
"There are plenty of mosquito breeding places within Colombo city
limits, but there are no adequate laws to arrest the owners and file
cases against them. Some tire sales shops in Colombo display used
tires which create very good breeding places for mosquitoes," they said.
Healthcare and Nutrition Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva has ordered
the Epidemiology Unit to finalize the Mosquito Breeding Control Act
as soon as possible in order to take legal action against such
persons, the sources said.

Health officials in New Caledonia have issued an alert against a
possible epidemic of dengue fever after 2 cases were reported in the territory.
A dengue outbreak killed 20 people there in 2003, and the government
says the latest cases show the people affected had not been traveling
outside the territory.
It says this indicates that local mosquitoes are responsible, and the
government is taking seriously the risk of an epidemic.

[An excerpt of the following letter in the April 2007 issue of
Emerging Infectious Diseases (cited above) follows. - Mod.TY]

"We have found that relative bradycardia is a notable clinical
feature of dengue fever in Singapore. To our knowledge, this sign has
not been previously associated with dengue. Awareness of this
possible clinical finding could help in the early recognition of
dengue and potentially reduce complications and death associated with
dengue virus infection. Clinical features that can be used in the
initial assessment of febrile patients are essential tools for
clinicians, especially in limited resource settings.
During the 2005 Singapore outbreak, we observed relative bradycardia
in several patients with dengue fever. We therefore performed a
case-control study comparing febrile dengue patients to patients with
other infectious diseases. Dengue fever may adversely affect cardiac function."

Summary of the Current Situation in Paraguay:
The Paraguayan government has continued the epidemiological alert
throughout the national territory in light of recent cases of dengue
and dengue hemorrhagic (DH).
Up to 9 Apr 2007 (Epidemiological Week/ EW No. 15), as a follow-up to
the 15 Mar 2007 update, the Ministry of Health of Paraguay reports
the following:
* 25 021 reported cases of dengue
* 52 cases of DH
* 13 deaths: 5 from atypical dengue, 6 from DH, and 2 from unconfirmed dengue
* Case-fatality rate: 11.5 percent
* Affected departments: Capital, Cordillera, Amambay, Central,
Concepcion, and Paraguari
Details:
Date of Occurrence: In October 2006, an increase of dengue cases
appeared with the DEN-3 [virus] serotype.
Specific Area of Impact: Cases have been reported in 17 of the 18
departments [state or province equivalents. - Mod.TY] in the country.
1. Brief Description of the Adverse Event
From 1 Jan to 9 Apr 2007, 25 021 cases have been reported
nationally. To date, 52 cases of DH have been reported. There have
been 13 deaths: 6 from DH, 5 from atypical forms, and 2 from unknown
causes. The case-fatality rate for DH to date is 11.5 per cent. Of
all reported cases of DH, 55 per cent have occurred among males. The
most affected age group are persons age 15 to 29 years (37 per cent
of the total), followed by those age one to 14 years (35 per cent).
The behavior of this epidemic has varied throughout the country. The
departments exceeding the average reporting rate for the country are,
in order of frequency, Capital, Cordillera, Amambay, Central, and
Concepcion, followed by Paraguari. The Capital shows an incidence
rate of 1357.2 cases for every 100 000 inhabitants.
Reports indicate that the peak of the epidemic occurred between EWs 8
and 9; although Amambay and Concepcion Departments showed an increase
in the incidence rate of reported cases during EWs 11 and 12. Toward
EW 12, it became clear that rates were falling in all departments,
with the exception of Amambay, Cordillera, and Paraguari, where they
remained stable.
With regard to hospitalizations from dengue, 3420 people were
admitted to hospitals due to some warning sign for dengue. On 8 Apr
2007, there were 25 hospital admissions. The curve since the month of
February 2007 shows daily fluctuations with a declining trend.
2. Main Activities Being Carried Out in the Health Sector
* The Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare of Paraguay
continues to coordinate door-to-door vector control activities to
eliminate breeding sites, in coordination with the National Emergency
System (SISNE).
* Regarding impact assessment of the vector control activities,
entomological samples have been taken using the LIRA method (for its
Spanish name; Rapid Assessment of _Aedes aegypti_ Index) in the
Municipalities of Villa Elisa, San Antonio, and Nemby, yielding
average infestation indices of 3.8 per cent, 7 per cent , and 5.5 per
cent, respectively. These indices are above the expected one per cent
rate. The larvae collected were mainly 3rd and 4th stage, which
indicates that these breeding sites have been in place for at least 7
days and thus were not eliminated in the vector control activities.
* Regarding epidemiological surveillance reports received in the last
3 weeks, the number of suspected cases has increased in the Asuncion
neighborhoods of Sajonia, Le Petit, Tacumbu, and Barrio Obrero, all
of which are in the process of undergoing door-to-door spraying with
portable equipment operated by staff from the National Service for
Malaria Elimination (SENEPA). The 7th spraying cycle using heavy-duty
machinery is near completion in Asuncioon and Central Departments.
Due to an insufficient number of heavy-machinery teams and heavy
rains over the last week, it has not been possible to reduce the
cycle to less than 7 days [Fumigation to reduce adult mosquito
populations in the face of an on-going dengue epidemic provides only
temporary reduction of virus transmission. Without very frequent
fumigation or elimination of breeding sites, as indicated below,
newly emerged adults will resume transmission if viremic people are
present as a source of infectious blood meals. - Mod.TY].
* The Situation Room is still hard at work, run by professionals from
the General Directorate of Health Epidemiology (DGVS).
3. Main Activities Being Carried Out by PAHO
* Involvement in SISNE meetings and providing technical support to
their discussions.
* Involvement in the disbursement of financial resources from
projects funded by the Spanish Agency of International Cooperation
(AECI) and by the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) of the
United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for
purchasing drugs, medical supplies, trituration equipment, as well as
for developing consultations and training activities.
* Active and broad involvement in discussions on field interventions
and decision-making processes.
* Reviewing and adjusting the Plan of Response of the PAHO/WHO
Representation in Paraguay (PWR-PAR) to the Epidemic of Dengue and
Dengue Hemorrhagic, Paraguay, 2007.
4. Main Activities Being Carried Out by Other Sectors
SISNE-operated vector control activities have been completed in
Asuncion and Central Departments, pending a few remaining properties
and closed-up dwellings that still need to be checked; this activity
will continue until the end of April 2007. Partial data on these
activities show the following general results:
* Of a total of 173 000 properties in Asuncion Department, 99 863
have been assigned to the National Directorate of Statistics,
Surveys, and Censuses (DGEEC). Of these, 58 291 were buildings free
of breeding sites, 7618 buildings had breeding sites eliminated, 4362
had been treated [fumigated? - Mod.TY] but did not eliminate breeding
sites, and 6215 have not yet been addressed. A total of 13 678
dwellings are uninhabited. To the date of collection of this
information (30 Mar 2007), 25 229 febrile patients have been
identified in the dwellings covered.
* For Central Department, 51 874 properties have been dealt with. A
total of 27 318 had no breeding sites, 2530 had eliminated breeding
sites, 1831 had treated their breeding sites, and 6650 have breeding
sites yet to be addressed. A total of 7041 are uninhabited dwellings.
* During the last 2 weeks of April and the beginning of May 2007, one
final activity will be carried out in Asuncion within the framework
of the Plan, namely revisiting those blocks at greatest
epidemiological risk. The Technical Advisory Group is now in the
process of compiling selection criteria for this. In Central
Department, activities related to closed or uninhabited dwellings and
to unwilling households will remain in the hands of the Government,
with logistic support from SISNE.

[It is good to see that this substantial dengue epidemic appears to
be subsiding. The situation in Paraguay illustrates the dilemma that
national health authorities face when the earliest cases are detected
and resources to respond are limited. Is it better to respond
aggressively at 1st, not knowing whether the outbreak is simply a
small, self-limited one not meriting the cost and effort (and adverse
publicity of "over-reacting") or the beginning of a major epidemic
that could easily get out of hand. With the benefit of retrospective
analysis, the Paraguay situation suggests that epidemic emergency
preparedness needs to be permanently in place, honed periodically
with simulation exercises, and that rapid response teams to assess
risk need to be in place. Had the high _Aedes aegypti_ indices been
known early on as the 1st cases appeared in October 2006, aggressive
Ministry of Health response would doubtless have been earlier.
Moreover, it probably would have been difficult to attract
international aid before the epidemic reached crisis proportions.
Where is it best to invest scarce financial and human resources when
there is an urgent need for competing schools, roads, health centers, etc.?
The WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that
affects infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The
clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile
illness with rash (although some infants and very young children may
develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume,
and die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] is a potentially deadly complication
that is characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often
with enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory
failure. The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in
temperature accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific
constitutional symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues
for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly
with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF
cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In
severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after
a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of
circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical
state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no
specific treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical
management by experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the
lives of DHF patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy,
mortality may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
