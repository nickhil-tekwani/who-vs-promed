The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed on Thursday [27 Dec
2007] a single case of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 bird
flu virus in a family in Pakistan but said there was no apparent risk
of it spreading wider.
A statement from the UN agency said tests in its special laboratories
in Cairo and London had established the "human infection" through
presence of the virus "collected from one case in an affected
family." But it said a WHO team invited to Pakistan to look into an
outbreak involving up to 9 people, from late October to 6 Dec 2007
had found no evidence of sustained or community human-to-human
transmission. No identified close contacts of the people infected,
including health workers and other members of the affected family,
had shown any symptoms and they had all been removed from medical
observation, the WHO added.
The outbreak followed a culling of infected chickens in the Peshawar
region, in which a veterinary doctor was involved. Subsequently he
and 3 of his brothers developed proven or suspected pneumonia. The
brothers cared for one another and had close personal contact both at
home and in the hospital, a WHO spokesman in Geneva said. One of
them, who was not involved in the culling, died on 23 Nov 2007. His
was the human-to-human transmission case confirmed by the WHO. The
others all recovered. "All the evidence suggests that the outbreak
within this family does not pose a broader risk," the WHO spokesman
told Reuters. "But there is already heightened surveillance and there
is a need for ongoing vigilance."
It was the 1st human-to-human case of H5N1 transmission in Pakistan,
while others have been confirmed in Indonesia and Thailand in similar
circumstances of what the WHO calls close contacts in a very
circumscribed area.
