Tanzania on [Mon 18 Jun 2018] issued an alert following an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in Kenya and Rwanda. Mary Mashingo, Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, said the government has instructed district, municipal and city councils to ensure that the public is well informed on the disease, which has killed 6 people in Kenya.

"We're fully aware of the outbreak of the disease and we've put in place all measures to ensure that our people are free from the disease," Mashingo told journalists in the country's capital, Dodoma.

There was so far no documented RVF case in the country, said Mashingo.

Mashingo directed the councils to ensure that all animals are sent in formal slaughtering areas where there are certified livestock specialists.

Rift Valley fever is a mosquito-borne viral disease that is endemic in parts of Africa. It affects both humans and livestock and spreads through infected blood, milk or the bite of infected mosquitoes.

[The concern of the Tanzanian public and animal health authorities about the potential appearance within their territory, of RVF -- which is currently circulating in their north-eastern and north western neighbors, Kenya and Rwanda respectively --, can be clearly perceived by visiting the map presenting the RVF-affected regions during the previous major RVF epidemic in eastern Africa. This event took place between February and May 2007, involving Tanzania, Kenya and Somali. The map is available at http://www.who.int/csr/don/RVF2007050.jpg.

The epidemiologic and clinical aspects of the 2007 event in Tanzania were addressed in Ref 1. The paper's abstract follows:

"In January 2007, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever (RVF) was detected among humans in northern Tanzania districts. By the end of the outbreak in June 2007, 511 suspect RVF cases had been recorded from 10 of the 21 regions of Tanzania, with laboratory confirmation of 186 cases and another 123 probable cases. All confirmed RVF cases were located in the north-central and southern regions of the country, with an eventual fatality rate of 28.2 percent (n = 144). All suspected cases had fever; 89 percent had encephalopathy, 10 percent hemorrhage, and 3 percent retinopathy. A total of 169 (55 percent) of the 309 confirmed or probable cases were also positive for malaria as detected by peripheral blood smear. In a cohort of 20 RVF cases with known outcome that were also positive for human immunodeficiency virus, 15 (75 percent) died. Contact with sick animals and animal products, including blood, meat, and milk, were identified as major risk factors of acquiring RVF".

Notably, Tanzania's Ministry of Livestock has not mentioned mass vaccination among the preventive measures to be undertaken. This falls in line with the view expressed in FAO's recent RVF manual (Ref 2). the document says:

"Mass vaccination in the face of an outbreak has never been successfully applied. This is because of the hyperacute nature of the outbreaks and the difficult environmental conditions often prevailing at onset. Without subsidized vaccine banks, the quantities available at the time of an outbreak -- whether predicted or not -- are often insufficient for mass vaccination. It has been estimated that the best-case scenario for procuring and positioning vaccines in the face of an expected epizootic episode, when vaccine production needs to be re-activated, is 147 days. This is prohibitively long, even if decision-makers were able to commit funds at the first indication of an early warning.

"National experts suggest that targeted vaccination of critical populations believed to be involved in the initial amplification of the virus can pre-empt outbreaks, or has the potential to do so. Irrespective of the above considerations, it makes sense to focus vaccination on the hotspots for emergence (as indicated by risk maps). This approach warrants further consideration and piloting. (...) Protecting animals at hotspots would reduce the impact of the outbreak on the livelihoods of affected communities."

[The outbreak of RVF in neighboring Kenya is due to the heavy rains and floods. There is no mention in this Tanzania alert if these rainy conditions prevail there as well. If they do, there is additional justification for the issuance of the alert. RVF virus is a bunyavirus and, as with some other mosquito-borne viruses, can be transovarily transmitted in _Aedes_ vector mosquitoes. Eggs with the virus can remain viable for many months and when flooded hatch with emerging adult females ready to bite and transmit the virus to humans and a variety of domestic animals. It is much better to be on alert and prepared than to be surprised by an outbreak. - Mod.TY
