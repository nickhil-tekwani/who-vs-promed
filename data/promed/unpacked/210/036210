Tough measures intensified to stop bird flu spread
--------------------------------------------------
The National Steering Committee for Bird Flu Control organised a meeting in
Ho Chi Minh City on Friday [14 Jan 2005] to discuss the implementation of
urgent preventive measures against the bird flu epidemic in southern provinces.
According to the Veterinary Department, the bird flu is spreading widely
and quickly. In December 2004, there were 39 bird flu outbreaks in 12
provinces and cities across the country. By 13 Jan 2005, the country
experienced as many as 84 outbreaks in 16 cities and provinces, including
Hau Giang, Bac Lieu, Tra Vinh, Long An, Dong Thap, An Giang, Binh Phuoc,
Can Tho, Tien Giang, Kien Giang, Ca Mau, Nam Dinh, Lam Dong, Ben Tre, Ha
Nam and Hanoi.
The Veterinary Department said that, due to low temperatures, the bird flu
would be spreading and developing faster in the regions which were earlier
hit by the epidemic, even in those areas having large poultry farms and
slaughter houses. Minister of agriculture and rural development Cao Duc
Phat stressed that preventing bird flu is a matter of great urgency. It is
essential to raise public awareness of the danger of the bird flu and
provide farmers with basic knowledge about preventive measures to help them
curb the epidemic, Mr Phat said.
Head of the Veterinary Department Bui Quang Anh warned that if tougher
measures are not implemented in the next 2 weeks, the epidemic will likely
spread to south-eastern provinces. He also underlined the need for
appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the disease to ensure safety
of food supplies for the upcoming lunar New Year Festival.
Vice chairman of the HCM City People Committee Nguyen Thien Nhan asked
local people not to eat poultry products without clear origin, not to buy
or sell poultry without clear origin, not to breed poultry [this unusual
requirement is probably related to the backyard breeding of poultry by city
dwellers within the densely populated urban areas. - Mod.AS], and not to
transport poultry illegally.
Meanwhile, the prime minister instructed provincial and the municipal
People's Committees, relevant ministries and sectors to mobilise all
resources and take drastic measures to isolate and extinguish outbreaks of
avian flu at the first signs. The ministries of agriculture and rural
development, health, and culture and information should closely co-operate
with provincial and city People's Committees to disseminate information on
this serious disease and on how to prevent and control the epidemic.
Inspection of transporting and slaughtering poultry must be tightened to
prevent the spread of the disease. Illegal poultry imports through land and
sea routes must be stopped while quarantine for imported animals at border
gates must be strengthened, the PM said.

Bird flu spreads to Vietnam's northern region
---------------------------------------------
Bird flu has just been detected in Hanoi capital city and northern Ha Nam
province, raising the total number of localities hit by the disease to 16,
local newspaper Youth on Saturday quoted the country's Animal Health
Department as saying. The bird flu was spotted in a flock of 400 ducks, a
flock of 600 chickens in Hanoi's Long Bien urban district, and a flock of
100 ducks in Ha Nam's Ly Nhan district.
Since last December [2004], Vietnam has detected 84 outbreaks in 16 cities
and provinces, namely Hanoi, Ha Nam, Nam Dinh, Lam Dong, Ben Tre, Ca Mau,
Kien Giang, Tien Giang, Can Tho, Binh Phuoc, An Giang, Dong Thap, Long An,
Tra Vinh, Bac Lieu and Hau Giang, which have killed and led to the forced
killing of nearly 168 000 fowl.
Also, the country has recently discovered 6 human cases of bird flu
infections, at least 4 of whom died. To curb the spread of bird flu among
poultry and persons, Vietnam is considering the possibility of vaccinating
fowls and researching into vaccines for humans.
"With the permission of the Ministry of Health, we are probing into
vaccines to prevent people from [contracting] bird flu. We hope that there
will be vaccines for [testing soon]," said Pham Ngoc Dinh, deputy director
of the National Institute for Hygiene and Epidemiology.
Prime minister Phan Van Khai, on Friday [14 Jan 2005], asked People's
Committees in cities and provinces and some ministries to mobilize all
forces to isolate and then contain new bird flu outbreaks, and monitor the
transport and trade of fowls more closely to prevent potential spread of
the disease.
After facing bird flu outbreaks from December 2003, Vietnam in late March
2004 declared an end to the bird flu that killed 17 per cent of its poultry
population, causing a total loss of 1.3 trillion Vietnamese dong (82.8
million dollars) to the local poultry industry. Since December [2003], the
disease has killed at least 24 people in the country.

[Avian influenza seems to continue its renewed epizootic in Viet Nam at a
rapid pace. Its spread into the north, including Vietnam's capital city
Hanoi, is rightly a cause of great concern to the Vietnamese authorities;
the situation in Viet Nam should be a cause for concern internationally.
Since our previous posting last week, when 9 provinces and cities were
reportedly infected, the following 6 provinces -- in addition to Hanoi --
have been added: the southern provinces Kien Giang, An Giang, Tra Vinh and
Hau Giang, and 2 northern provinces, Ha Nam and Nam Dinh. An administrative
map of Viet Nam can be seen at
