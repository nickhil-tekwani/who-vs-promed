Anthrax has been detected on a farm in regional Victoria after a sheep died from the bacterial infection. The dead sheep was found on a property at Swan Hill near the NSW [New South Wales] border, which has since been quarantined, Victoria's agriculture department said on [Thu 1 Mar 2018].

"We are taking the necessary steps to reduce the likelihood of this detection impacting more livestock. Some local measures have been put in place and at-risk livestock are being vaccinated," chief veterinary officer Dr Charles Milne said. However the veterinary officer has said the discovery wasn't unusual and it wouldn't impact the movement of people or vehicles.

"Incidents commonly occur during the warmer months when it's drier and the cattle and sheep forage deeper into the soil when eating grass," Dr Milne said. He said the disease was a naturally occurring bacteria that is present in soil in parts of Northern Victoria.

Agriculture Victoria veterinarians and animal health staff are responding to a positive case of anthrax identified in a sheep on a property near Swan Hill. Anthrax has been identified as the cause of death for one animal.

Victoria's chief veterinary officer, Dr Charles Milne, said the affected property had been quarantined and biosecurity requirements have been put in place. "We are taking the necessary steps to reduce the likelihood of this detection impacting more livestock, some local measures have been put in place and at-risk livestock are being vaccinated," he said. "Quarantine controls will not affect the movement of local people or vehicles, including school bus routes."

Livestock anthrax is enzootic in Victoria so a repeat outbreak following the many outbreaks of last summer is not unexpected. A fair question would be whether this sheep that died had been vaccinated before the summer vaccine season started. I suspect not. Livestock vaccination is the best and most cost effective way of preventing new cases in high risk areas. And the vaccine is very cheap. Pennies compared to the potential value of animals at risk. - Mod.MHJ]
