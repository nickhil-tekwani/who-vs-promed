[According to the notification, no cases have been recorded in the
(1322, later vaccinated) swine (on the same farm/village?). It will
be interesting to note if this means absent or rather subclinical
infection with the Asia 1 FMD virus, which caused disease in cattle.

One of the control measures reportedly applied was
"dipping/spraying," a measure generally applicable for the control of
external parasites; has this been done to prevent further spread by
insect vectors? clarification will help.

It will also be helpful to obtain clarification to the vaccination,
in response to the outbreak, of the swine with a monovalent serotype
O vaccine and not with the serotype involved, namely FMDV Asia 1.

A map, showing the location of the outbreak, is included in the notification.
