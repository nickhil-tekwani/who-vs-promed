Bangladesh: Death from undiagnosed illness in Northwest
-------------------------------------------------------
Bird flu experts are part of a team investigating the unexplained
death of 3 people in northern Bangladesh, the official BSS News
Agency reported on Wed 14 Feb 2007.
Bangladesh has so far reported no cases of avian influenza. "The
Health Directorate of Dhaka formed a 5-member medical team comprising
bird flu experts and sent them to the village and started an
investigation into the disease", the BSS report said.
The investigation followed the death of a 32-year-old man on 26 Jan
2007. His wife, 24, died last Friday [9 Feb 2007] after becoming ill
with similar symptoms, the report said without giving details.
Another man died in hospital in Dhaka on Mon 12 Feb 2007. Two others
-- including the sister of one of the deceased -- were also taken ill
and hospitalised in serious condition, BSS said. All came from the
same village of Beloya, Thakurgaon district, in northwestern
Bangladesh.

[The description of the illness is too slight to hazard an opinion as
to its nature at this juncture. Further information on this cluster
of cases from an informed source in the region would be appreciated.
