"The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) is launching an ambitious modernization project of its World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS).

WAHIS is the OIE internet-based computer system that processes data on animal diseases in real-time from Member Countries and some non-Member Countries and territories and then informs the international community through its Interface. Ten years after it was launched and 4 years after major upgrades, the demands on the WAHIS information system have outgrown its capacity. Consequently the OIE is in the process of developing a new system (WAHIS+).

In order to ensure the new WAHIS+ meets the needs of our stakeholders, we are seeking input from people and organizations using animal health data through the completion of a voluntary survey "Building the new WAHIS+ together", available in English, French and Spanish.

The goal of this survey is to determine users' needs regarding data access and display, as well as to provide suggestions for the new WAHIS+.

Please spend 15-20 minutes of your time to answer the survey and feel free to share the questionnaire with other users that may be interested to be part of the survey.

To complete the survey, please click on the following link by 27th April 2017: http://www.esurveyspro.com/Survey.aspx?id=4e78ca08-2f86-41ed-940d-cb00e0f62e5b

This survey is also available from the WAHIS Interface < http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Wahidhome/Home> as well as from the OIE web site home page http://www.oie.int

We greatly value your input. We thank you very much in advance for your collaboration.
