Estonian Poultry Culled After Newcastle Disease Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------
Estonia's biggest poultry firm AS Tallegg began slaughtering 237 000
chickens Wednesday [7 Nov 2007] after an outbreak of Newcastle
disease, which is highly contagious for birds but poses no risk for
humans. The operation at the company's farm near Tallinn also
involves the destruction of 1.65 million eggs, officials said.

AS Tallegg said its stock was insured. In addition, Estonia's
Veterinary and Food Board said the state would pay the company EUR 1
million [USD 1 467 405] in compensation. Tallegg said it expected its
egg production to be back to normal by the end of next summer. The
company has already decided to vaccinate all its new egg-laying
chickens in future against Newcastle disease.

"The eggs produced by infected chickens are not a health risk for
people who eat them," said Teet Soorm, head of Tallegg's board.

The destruction of chickens and eggs in farms where the Newcastle
disease has been found is obligatory under European Union rules. The
outbreak of the virus was confirmed on Monday [5 Nov 2007] after
tests carried out in the U.K. at the request of Estonian health
authorities turned out positive.

Newcastle disease has occurred in several E.U. member states in
recent years -- there was an outbreak in southern Estonia in July --
as well as other east European countries such as Ukraine.
