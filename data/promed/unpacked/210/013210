Due to findings of citrus black spot (CBS) in Argentinian lemons in European ports, Argentina declared an export ban for at least 15 days. The country is putting rigorous measures into place. A plan of action is being developed which is to include additional measures to minimise the risk of CBS spreading before the end of the 2020 export season.

After regulations were tightened for South African [see ProMED-mail post 20140603.2516043] and Brazilian citrus imports to Europe, exporters are afraid to lose their markets. Therefore they are taking control of the situation in their own countries.

[Citrus black spot (CBS) caused by the fungus _Phyllosticta citricarpa_ (previously _Guignardia citricarpa_) is one of the most serious diseases of the crops in Asia and regions of the southern hemisphere. Symptoms can occur on leaves but are most severe on fruit. They include sunken lesions of varying size, shape and colour, depending on stage of fruit or leaf development. The disease may also lead to post-harvest losses since fruit that may not show visible symptoms while on the tree may develop characteristic lesions in storage under suitable conditions. Fungal strains which do not cause symptoms also exist. CBS causes significant losses due to premature fruit and leaf drop, as well as disfiguration of fruit for fresh markets.

Spores are produced under fallen leaves and sometimes on fruit. Spread occurs by air currents, on contaminated plant material (including nursery plants or scions with latent infections) and by mechanical means. The disease is particularly virulent late in the season and losses tend to be most severe in late maturing varieties. All commercial citrus cultivars are susceptible to varying extents, except for sour orange (_Citrus aurantium_). Disease management includes fungicides, phytosanitation and pathogen exclusion. Once established in a region, eradication of a sporulating fungus such as _P. citricarpa_ is considered impossible.

CBS had been introduced into the USA by unknown means (ProMED-mail post 20100412.1183). This emphasised the risk to northern hemisphere citrus industries and the European Plant Protection Organisation (EPPO) included CBS in their A1 quarantine list. When large numbers of quarantine detections (ProMED-mail post 20131204.2090761) implied that certification of disease freedom at point of origin was not working effectively, an import ban was considered to protect European citrus. However, stricter EU regulations were approved instead (see ProMED-mail post 20150714.3509850). The report above suggests that these measures are still not effective, but that at least they seem to have led to a hightened awareness of exporters.

A study suggesting that the CBS pathogen is already present in Europe was considered unconvincing by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The disease was recently reported from the non-European Mediterranean region (Tunisia, ProMED-mail post 20200127.6923517), but so far, CBS has not been confirmed in Europe. It remains a threat to the region, national surveys and monitoring are ongoing (for more information see links below).
