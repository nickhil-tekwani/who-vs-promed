The 1st human case associated with the H5 bird flu in the United States was detected in a Colorado man. The Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention] (CDC) shared information on the case with the public on Thursday [28 Apr 2022], adding the "public health risk assessment remains low." The CDC adds people who have job-related or recreational exposures to infected birds are at a higher risk of infection and should take appropriate precautions.

The CDC has been monitoring people exposed to H5N1 virus-infected birds since the outbreaks were first detected in wild birds and poultry in late 2021. To date [28 Apr 2022], H5N1 viruses have been found in US commercial and backyard birds in 29 states and in wild birds in 34 states. CDC has tracked the health of more than 2500 people with exposures to H5N1 virus-infected birds, and this is the only case that has been found to date. Other people involved in the culling operation in Colorado have tested negative for H5 virus infection, but they are being tested again out of an abundance of caution. Several wild birds have tested positive for the virus in Colorado.

"This is the 2nd human case associated with this specific group of H5 viruses that are currently predominant, and the 1st case in the United States," part of a news release from the CDC reads. "The 1st case internationally occurred in December 2021 in the United Kingdom in a person who did not have any symptoms and who raised birds that became infected with H5N1 virus. More than 880 human infections with earlier H5N1 viruses have been reported since 2003 worldwide, however, the predominant H5N1 viruses now circulating among birds globally are different from earlier H5N1 viruses."

The 40-year-old man who tested positive was isolating as of Thursday [28 Apr 2022], as he was only experiencing fatigue. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) is reporting the positive result is due to direct exposure to infected poultry at a commercial farm in Montrose County. The person, who is an inmate at a state correctional facility in Delta County, was working with poultry as part of a pre-release employment program where participants have the opportunity to work for private employers and be paid a prevailing wage. The affected flock has been euthanized and disposed of under the guidance of the USDA and CDA. All members of the response team, including other inmate workers, were provided personal protective equipment while working on the farm.

"We want to reassure Coloradans that the risk to them is low," said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist, Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. "I am grateful for the seamless collaboration between CDC, Department of Corrections, Department of Agriculture, and CDPHE, as we continue to monitor this virus and protect all Coloradans." CDPHE adds human infections of the H5 viruses are rare.

[The above report mentions the 1st human case of avian influenza A/H5N1 in the United States. The 1st human case with this specific virus group was reported in December 2021 in the UK. The predominant H5N1 viruses now circulating among birds globally are different from earlier H5N1 viruses. The case had a history of direct exposure to poultry.

Typically human cases of zoonotic/avian influenza viruses are preceded by outbreaks in poultry; there have been numerous outbreaks of avian influenza A/H5N1 in USA and Canada, with loss of over 31 million birds in the US commercial poultry industry in 2022 (https://www.wattagnet.com/blogs/27-agrifood-angle/post/44969-breaking-down-us-avian-flu-cases-by-flock-type).

Mod.TG comments: "As one looks through the postings of the rampage of avian influenza, it becomes abundantly clear this virus is sweeping through the country like a grim reaper. The virus is merciless to both domestic birds and some species of wild birds in the USA and Canada.

"Destroyed bird counts are increasingly going up. This means live bird counts are going down, affecting eggs and meat birds and decreasing wildlife. As dead bird counts mount, the cost is rising in the grocery stores, and in the cost of replacement birds" (from Avian influenza (106): Americas (Canada, USA) mixed flocks, HPAI H5N1 20220429.8702913).

"Because of the possible threat bird flu viruses pose to human health, [it is important to conduct] research to learn more about these viruses, for example, where they spread, how they spread, and what kinds of disease they cause. This includes antigenic characterization, antiviral resistance, genetic characterization, serology and assessment of bird flu viruses' ability to cause disease and spread in animal models. This information, coupled with disease surveillance information, can help scientists better understand the risk these viruses pose to human health" (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/risk-assessment-research.html).

Using the WHO animal-human interface review dated 14 Apr 2022, we understand that most human cases were sporadic infections exposed to A(H5) viruses through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, including live poultry markets (https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/influenza-at-the-human-animal-interface-summary-and-assessment-7-april-2021). Since the viruses continue to be detected in animals and related environments, further human cases can be expected.

Even though small clusters of A(H5) virus infections have been reported previously, including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that influenza A(H5) viruses have not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans; thus, the likelihood is low.

Strong surveillance is needed at the health facility level for cases presenting with the respiratory illness and history of handling poultry. With the COVID-19 pandemic far from over, this remains a challenge and requires continued advocacy. Human infections with microorganisms of animal origin must be suspected among the population when human-animal interfacing is common. Surveillance for influenza viruses both in poultry/animal and human population, together with early laboratory confirmation of such viruses to detect antigenic drift or shift conferring human-to-human transmission of these viruses, is critical for a timely response to avoid any large-scale public health event.
