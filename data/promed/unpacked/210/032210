Anthrax has broken out in Chama District of the Eastern Province.
Principal Veterinary Officer Joseph Sitali says the disease has
already killed a number of wild animals. Dr. Sitali, however, could
not give the number of animals that have died from the disease so far.

He told agriculture Deputy Minister Daniel Kalenga in Chipata on
Wednesday [1 Oct 2008] that it has been difficult to control the
disease due to inadequate resources.

And Provincial Agriculture Coordinator Obvious Kabinda said there is
a need for urgent measures to control anthrax.

Dr. Kabinda said the disease was earlier reported in South and North
Luangwa National Parks.

[Recently, most anthrax reports from Zambia have involved the Western
Province -- see below -- without a whisper of any livestock or
wildlife cases in the Eastern Province. Obviously, reality is
different. In 1987-91, there were multiple outbreaks involving a wide
range of species in the South Luangwa National Park. In a severe
epidemic in 2001, some 120 hippos (_Hippopotamus amphibius_) and 4
buffaloes (_Syncercus caffer_) were reported dead of anthrax, but the
actual numbers were far greater. The aerial photographs of the dead
hippos clogging the Luangwa river were numbing.

We would appreciate a more complete account of the present situation
in the province. The news report wording would imply that livestock
deaths have been occurring, as the response activity has involved
senior provincial agriculture officers.

Chama is in the northern portion of the province, near the border
with Malawi. For a closer look, go to:
