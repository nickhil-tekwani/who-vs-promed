Federal officials will take samples from deer during next month's hunting
season so they can be checked for a condition called chronic wasting
disease (CWD), state wildlife officials said.
The tests are part of the government's effort to find common factors among
people affected by a fatal brain condition known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease (CJD) or a variant of the disease (vCJD).
With help from Maine game officials, the national Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Agriculture Department's (USDA)
Animal, Plant, Health Inspection Service (APHIS) will test 300 samples from
deer brain stems.
The samples are to be taken from deer heads left with butchers and packers
who process meat from deer shot in Maine during the hunting season, which
begins for Maine residents Saturday and ends Nov. 27, a spokesman for the
state Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Department said.
Similar tests have been conducted on samples from game shot in several
other states.
The CDC has conducted extensive interviews with families of young adults
who have been affected by vCJD or CJD, and found 3 of the affected young
adults had eaten deer meat at some time in their lives, Maine game
officials said.
Deer samples from western Maine are being tested because a 28-year-old
woman who was diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in 1997 is believed
to have consumed venison from the area more than 20 years ago when she was
a child. The same woman also had consumed elk from a western state when she
was young.
"What they're doing is looking for any possible link or clue as to why
someone relatively young would be affected by this disease," state game
department spokesman Mark Latti said Monday.
Maine game officials said they are cooperating with federal officials even
though they said there is no known relationship between CWD and any other
illness affecting animals or people, including CJD.
Chronic Wasting Disease is an abnormality in the brain causing affected
deer and elk to become emaciated and exhibit behavioral changes. The
disease has been found in farmed elk in 3 states, but all 4500 deer and elk
samples analyzed outside affected areas in the United States have tested
negative.
Under the microscope, brains from animals affected by CWD appear similar to
brains of humans affected by Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
