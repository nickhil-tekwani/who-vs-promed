[Today the staff of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, across the street
from the University Hospital in Rio de Janeiro, received an official
recommendation to get YF vaccination at the Hospital, which is free for
them. Members of the public are waiting for mass vaccination to start,
because at present they have to pay for their shots unless they can show
they are travelling to an endemic area in Brazil or elsewhere. - Mod.JW
