Perhaps it is worth noting that lentiviruses ...
in their end-stages... can give rise to prion
diseases (i.e., subacute encephalopathies). That
is the significance of studying, teaching and
co-citing 3 classic articles by Bjorn Sigurdsson
(Sigurdsson, 1954a; Sigurdsson, 1954b;
Sigurdsson, 1954c; Smith, 1984; Smith, 2001).

[CAE and maedi-visna (MV) are exclusively animal
diseases; the above comparative medicine
observations are, in fact, an excellent example of the 'One Health' concept.

Bjorn Sigurdsson's papers addressed "three slow
infections of sheep" in Iceland: a viral one
(Maedi-Visna), a bacterial one (paratuberculosis,
Johne's disease) and Rida (suggested to be
similar to the prion disease scrapie). Their
dramatic spread within the highly susceptible
local sheep caused tremendous losses. Most
probably, all 3 were introduced by rams imported
for breeding purposes from Germany. To control
these diseases, it was eventually decided to cull
a large proportion of Iceland's sheep population.

The following recent paper can be added to the references:
