An Australian epidemiologist who is in Fiji to help local health
authorities control dengue virus says the current mosquito eradication
campaign in the country is not effective. (?Tony Stewart), one of two
experts assisting the Fiji Health Ministry, says mosquitoes will continue
to breed despite the spraying programme.
Meanwhile, the `Daily Post' reports that 10 children are among 25 new
dengue fever cases admitted to hospital in the capital, Suva. Already four
people have died in the latest outbreak.

[Last we heard, there had been three deaths. If this report is accurate,
there now have been four. This, however, is not an official report. If
anyone can provide accurate and up-to-date information on this situation,
we would appreciate it.
As for the comment that the mosquito campaign is not effective, that may be
because when insecticides are sprayed and people close windows and blinds
when the spraying truck passes, the insecticide does not enter the house,
which is where the target mosquitoes are. The only effective means is
source reduction (destruction of mosquito breeding habitats) and killing of
adult mosquitoes. We shall have to await more definitive reports as to why
the Australian consultant considers the campaign ineffective. - Mod.CHC
