21 persons, including 2 children and 10 women, have fallen ill reportedly
due to anthrax in certain localities of Murshidabad district in West
Bengal, a senior health officer claimed today.
While 5 persons were diagnosed as reportedly having the disease today [18
Apr 2004], 16 others were diagnosed yesterday in Shibnagar, Bhagirathpur
and Ghatpara localities, Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr Sachhidananda
Sarkar said after visiting the affected villages.
The disease was believed to have been caused after consumption of meat of a
sick cattle a few days back, Sarkar said, adding the medical team has
collected samples from the affected areas.
The villagers have been advised not to consume meat of any sick cattle, he
said. An 8-year-old child and another 10-year-old are among those affected
by the disease, he added.
7 persons had fallen sick in adjoining Dangapara village in Domkal police
station area months back, the CMO said.

[If ever there was an argument for a standard control programme with
regular annual vaccination of the village cattle (at least) in West Bengal,
this would be it. Each report of human and/or animal cases we get from
India demonstrates a reactive response instead of a proactive structured
programme. Note that they had adequate warning from the prior cases in Domkal.
If you want to maintain anthrax in your region this is the way to do it: do
nothing in an endemic/enzootic region until there are cases. I have said
this before and I will say it again -- that if there are human cases of
anthrax, it is usually because of shortcomings of the responsible
veterinarians, not by the physicians. If one prevents cases in livestock,
one automatically prevents human cases, unless it is an industrial exposure
to contaminated animal products. If any of our Indian members have
information to add, we would appreciate hearing from them. Our thanks to
Joseph for this prompt referral. - Mod.MHJ]
