Typhoid fever increasing in Kyrgyzstan
-------------------------------------
Osh City
------
Beginning in July 2004, 103 patients were hospitalized in the infectious
disease department with a preliminary diagnosis of abdominal typhus
[typhoid fever - Mod.LL]. 24 were confirmed by lab data (3 in July, 12 in
August, 7 in September, and 2 in October 2004). 4 cases of paratyphoid
type-B were also diagnosed in October 2004.
Currently, 3 more people with a preliminary diagnosis of typhoid fever, and
4 with a confirmed diagnosis, have been admitted to the local hospital.
Talass City
------
Beginning in August 2004, in Talass City (Karaburinskiy village), 71
patients were hospitalized with a preliminary diagnosis of typhoid. 38 of
them were confirmed in the laboratory. One of the patients died due to
intestinal hemorrhage. There were also 2 cases of paratyphoid type-B
reported in the same village.
Batken City (Batken village)
------
110 confirmed cases of typhoid have been registered in Batken village since
June 2004. Presently, 15 patients with a confirmed diagnosis are receiving
treatment in the Batken Infectious Diseases Hospital.
Jalalabad city (Nookensk village)
------
From 8 to 20 Oct 2004, 63 patients were hospitalized with a preliminary
diagnosis of typhoid, 38 of them confirmed by laboratory analysis.
Most of the patients are schoolchildren. The likely hypothesis of the cause
of the outbreak in that school may be the use of contaminated water for
drinking. So far, 2 cultures of typhoid bacillus were obtained from a local
river.

[Kyrgyzstan is still experiencing problems with water cleaning systems,
especially in remote regions, resulting in so many outbreaks in different
parts of Kyrgyzstan. - Mod.NR]
[Laboratory confirmation could be a positive Widal test (antibody specific
for the typhoid bacillus) or by culture. - Mod.LL]
