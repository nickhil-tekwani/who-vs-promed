All beekeepers on Kangaroo Island are being asked to participate in a round of surveillance for American Foulbrood and Small Hive Beetle, with testing costs covered by PIRSA [Department of Primary Industries and Regions, Southern Australia], as recent discoveries have the industry in high alert.

PIRSA is also holding workshops so that all beekeepers on the Island understand these pests, how to look out for them, and how to participate in the surveillance. The department said it is important that all persons keeping honeybees attend a workshop, even if not yet registered, or just keep a hive for interest.

Small Hive Beetle was first detected in Kangaroo Island hives in January 2021. It is a free-flying, fast-moving beetle that eats bees, honey and pollen. It can cause hive death and contaminate honey.

It is believed to be confined to hives in the Hanson Bay area. It is not notifiable, but beekeepers are encouraged to report detected or suspected Small Hive Beetle to PIRSA.

American Foulbrood was originally detected in honey from hives on the Island in May 2020. It is a bacterial disease that, if unmanaged, kills hives and ultimately whole apiaries.

It is highly infectious, and can be easily spread via honeybees, honeybee products, honeybee property, and the beekeeper. It is a notifiable disease, so all detected or suspected cases of American Foulbrood must be reported to PIRSA, and all beekeepers must implement biosecurity practices.

Everyone on the Island is asked to assist by ensuring no bee products (including honey, wax and pollen), beehives, bees, beehive material and equipment are brought onto the Island. PIRSA is also requesting all persons with honeybees on Kangaroo Island to inspect all their hives in the next 5 weeks in an effort to identify any further occurrences and prevent further spread.

[American Foulbrood (AFB) is caused by _Paenibacillus larvae_, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium known for its ability to cause this severe and notiÔ¨Åable disease of honeybees. _P. larvae_ is endemic to bee colonies worldwide. Its spores are highly resilient and can survive in honey for years.

The infection can be transmitted to larvae by nurse bees or by spores remaining at the base of a brood cell. The susceptibility of larvae to AFB disease decreases with increasing age. Larvae cannot be infected later than 53 hours after the egg has hatched.

Larvae can be killed rapidly at an early age when they are curled at the base of uncapped brood cells. Adult worker bees will remove these dead larvae leaving only an empty cell. Other larvae will die later on in their development, when they are in an upright position, filling most of the brood cell. Often the larvae or pupae will die after brood cell capping.

The small hive beetle (_Aethina tumida_) is native to sub-Saharan Africa, but has spread to North America, Australia, the Philippines, and other locations. It can be a destructive pest of honeybee colonies. - Mod.PMB
