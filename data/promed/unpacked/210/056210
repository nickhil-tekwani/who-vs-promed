Pigs and avian flu
------------------
[Re: Avian influenza - Eastern Asia (44): Indonesia, pigs, RFI]
Could culled chickens be used (illegally, of course) as food for
pigs? Farmers hate to waste anything and might not understand the
finer points of infectious disease transmission.

[Dr Despommier's query is appropriate. Feeding of chicken manure,
often including chicken carcasses or parts thereof, to food animals
-- herbivores included -- has been widely practiced in many
countries. Most countries require that the recycled material be
derived only from farms considered free of infectious diseases. Some
countries allow it only in certain species and/or husbandry methods.
