The number of cases of scarlet fever in the [Swindon] area is still abnormally high for this time of year, despite the usual season for the illness coming to an end.

Public Health England [PHE] is reporting 656 cases of the illness, which typically affects children, in the Avon, Gloucestershire, and Wiltshire area since September [2014]. Nationally there have been 8305 cases in the same period, more than 4 times the 10-year average.

There is no vaccine for the disease, so health officials have advised anyone with symptoms to seek help from their GP, who will normally prescribe a dose of antibiotics.

Dr Ayo Oyinloye, the Consultant in Public Health Medicine at Swindon Council said: "Relatively high levels of scarlet fever for the time of year, compared to recent years, continue across the country. This national trend also applies to Swindon and surrounding areas. Scarlet fever is a mild illness in most people and can be treated effectively with antibiotics. It usually affects young children, although adults are not immune. Symptoms include a sore throat, fever, headache and rash, and those with symptoms should seek advice from their GP. You can catch scarlet fever by inhaling airborne droplets if someone with the illness coughs or sneezes in the air near you.

"Swindon Council would like to reiterate the advice given by Public Health England that to reduce the risk of infection, and minimise spread, people should practise good hand hygiene and remember to cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze and to wash their hands afterwards. All used tissues should be disposed of immediately."

The cause of the outbreak is not known, but the unseasonably mild winter is one possibility. "Health experts are looking into the possibility that a new strain of the illness has developed."

Last month PHE contacted all nurseries and schools to advise them of how to deal with the illness and take precautions to prevent it spreading. Lawn Primary School, which has had no known cases of the disease, has taken a number of precautions to minimise the risk following advice from PHE. Headteacher Kelly James said: "As with all letters we get regarding illnesses we follow the guide given to us. "All parents are sent a copy of the letter and all the staff are told as well as letters going up in our 1st aid areas. I think in cases like this then making sure everyone is informed is the key. In the spring time we also carried out a full clean of the school to make sure that any surface the children came into contact with was cleaned to make sure the risk of cases was reduced."

Group A streptococcal infections: 4th update on seasonal activity, 2013/14
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Surveillance of scarlet fever continues to show high levels of notified cases in England but with early signs of a possible reduction in incidence [1-4]. GP consultations for pharyngitis/scarlet fever via the GP sentinel (syndromic) surveillance also indicate a slight reduction in disease incidence [5]. Routine laboratory reports and isolate referrals of invasive group A streptococcal (iGAS) disease remain within the usual seasonal levels.

Investigations continue in an attempt to identify the reasons for the unusual escalation in scarlet fever this season including microbiological investigation of scarlet fever isolates sampled from across the country. Interim guidelines to assist local health protection staff in managing outbreaks of scarlet fever in schools and nurseries have been issued [6].

Due to rare but potentially severe complications associated with GAS infections, continued vigilance is recommended.

Scarlet fever
-------------
A total of 8305 scarlet fever cases have been notified so far this season (week 37 2013 to week 17 2014 [9 Sep 2013-27 Apr 2014]; figure 1), with week 15 of 2014 [7-13 Apr 2014] seeing the highest number of scarlet fever notifications received in one week (1069) in England. Numbers of notifications dropped subsequent to week 15, with 405 notified for week 17 [21-27 Apr 2014], although further notifications may still be received for the most recent weeks. The time series follows a similar pattern when assessed according to date of onset, with week 14 [31 Mar-6 Apr 2014] having the highest number of cases.

Assessment of the most recent 4-week period (weeks 14 to 17 [31 Mar-27 Apr 2014]) continues to indicate substantial elevation across all areas in England compared to the same period last year [2013]. In the Greater Manchester area the number of scarlet fever notifications are twice as high as those reported for the same 4 week period last year (101 compared to 44), with all other areas in England notifying between 4 and 15 times more cases.

Cumulative rates of notification this season are shown in figure 2. Highest rates of notified cases have been seen in the East Midlands (35.2), Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire (27.7), Thames Valley (21.6), North East (20.2), and Cumbria and Lancashire (18.4).

87 percent of notifications received this season have been in children aged less than 10 years, the median age remains 4 years (range less than 1 year to 90 years). The proportion of notifications seen in males (49 percent) and females remains similar.

Invasive group A _Streptococcus_ (iGAS)
---------------------------------------
The number of iGAS [invasive Group A _Streepotococcus_] isolate referrals, defined as isolation of GAS from a normally sterile site, to the Respiratory and Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Reference Unit at Colindale PHE from laboratories in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland so far this season (week 37 2013 to week 16 2014 [9 Sep 2013-20 Apr 2014]) continues to remain within normal levels, with a total of 924 isolates referred (range 691 to 1098 for the same period in the previous 5 years; figure 3). Only laboratories in London (73), East Midlands (52), and the South East (113) have referred numbers of isolates above average for January to April this season [2014] compared with the previous 5 years (59, 45, and 107 respectively). Isolates are still being received for specimens taken in April [2014] and as such, these numbers may increase.

Currently the iGAS strain type diversity remains similar to what is normally seen; emm1 remains the most common type identified so far in 2014 (26 percent; January to April). The proportion of referred isolates which have been identified as emm3 type is slightly high this season compared to last season (23 percent compared with 14 percent), and given the increased severity of disease associated with emm3 strains this warrants close monitoring.

No changes have been identified in iGAS isolate antimicrobial susceptibility patterns from routine laboratory reporting this season (weeks 37 2013 to 16 2014 [9 Sep 2013-20 Apr 2014]), with 5 percent of those tested being non-susceptible to erythromycin, 9 percent tetracycline, and 3 percent clindamycin, all similar to previous years [7]. There have been no reports of penicillin resistance in iGAS isolates in England to date.

Whilst the early suggestions of a drop in incidence are welcome, we maintain a cautious optimism and continue to closely monitor the situation over the coming weeks. The Easter school holidays [5-21 Apr 2014] may have facilitated a reduction in transmission but they will also affect timeliness of notification and access to GPs. Surveillance systems based on out-of-hours GP consultations for week 17 [21-27 Apr 2014] also showed a drop in consultations for pharyngitis and persistent sore throat [8].

Investigations are underway to explore the possible reasons behind the exceptional increase in scarlet fever. Microbiological investigations are being conducted through a sentinel sampling scheme being undertaken in collaboration with PHE Regional Microbiology laboratories and selected NHS laboratories. New guidelines on the public health management of scarlet fever outbreaks were developed to support Health Protection Teams [HPT], working closely with schools, nurseries and colleagues in local authorities, to control outbreaks in child care settings and protect vulnerable children and adults [6].

Clinicians, microbiologists and HPTs should continue to be mindful of potential increases in invasive disease and maintain a high index of suspicion in relevant patients as early recognition and prompt initiation of specific and supportive therapy for patients with iGAS infection can be life-saving. Invasive disease isolates and those from suspected clusters or outbreaks should be submitted to the Respiratory and Vaccine Preventable Bacteria Reference Unit at Public Health England, 61 Colindale Avenue, London NW9 5HT.
