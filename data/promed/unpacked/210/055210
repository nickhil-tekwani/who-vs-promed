Minnesota health officials confirmed Mon 16 May 2016, that they detected and investigated a salmonellosis outbreak beginning in April 2016 continuing into May 2016 that they linked to Taylor Farms Organic Kale Medley Power Greens sold at Sam's Club locations in the state. Federal officials also detected a person in Virginia sickened by the same strain and are monitoring the situation for additional victims.

A total of 7 people -- 6 in Minnesota and 1 in Virginia -- have been confirmed as all having _Salmonella [enterica serotype] Enteritidis_ infections that have the same DNA fingerprint, according to the CDC.

"In early May [2016], Minnesota health officials notified CDC about an investigation into salmonellosis in their state. CDC is monitoring PulseNet for any additional illness with the same DNA pattern nationally," CDC officials said Mon 16 May 2016 in an email response to questions from Food Safety News. "It has been several weeks since the last illness occurred. If additional cases of illness are identified, CDC will work with states to obtain information about foods consumed before becoming ill."

The April-May outbreak was traced to a packaged organic salad product distributed nationwide to Sam's Club retail locations by Taylor Farms of Salinas, CA, said a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH). All 6 Minnesota victims reported eating Taylor Farms Organic Kale Medley Power Greens Mix before becoming ill.

Neither the MDH nor the Minnesota Department of Agriculture posted outbreak information or otherwise notified the public about the outbreak or their investigation of it. "The illnesses began between April 3 and April 26. One person was hospitalized, and all are recovering," MDH Information officer Doug Schultz said Monday in response to questions from Food Safety News. Schultz confirmed much of what Pacific Coast Fruit Co. posted in a 6 May 2016 notice on its website. The produce company intended the notice to inform its customers and employees that it had not handled any of the implicated salad, which Sam's Club quietly pulled from shelves across the country.

"Sam's Club was an extremely cooperative and proactive partner in the investigation; they pulled the implicated product from their store shelves nationwide on 4 May 2016 and directly notified all customers who had purchased the product in Minnesota since 1 Mar 2016," the MDH spokesman said.

Minnesota health officials notified the FDA about the outbreak and investigation in early May. The federal agency joined the investigation at that time, Schultz said.

"The FDA is not requiring any action from Taylor Farms and we are not issuing any formal recalls. We will continue to work with the MDH and MDA (Minnesota Department of Agriculture) regarding this issue," according to a statement Taylor Farms sent to trading partners on 6 May 2016 and provided to Food Safety News on 15 May 2016.

Minnesota's health department spokesman said he could neither confirm nor deny reports that the implicated organic salad from Taylor Farms was exclusively distributed to Sam's Club locations. "This would be a question better posed to FDA and/or Taylor Farms. All of the Minnesota cases were exposed to product purchased at Sam's Club locations," Schultz said.

[It appears that this small outbreak tied to packaged kale salad from a large chain is over, but it remains unclear what the distribution of the product was. - Mod. LL
