Tinned sardines eaten for lunch by an impoverished family killed one child
and sent to the hospital four other members.
[A man] of Barangay Rawis, this city, told reporters he bought on credit a
tin of Atami sardines from a neighborhood store and served it without prior
cooking because his children were very hungry and it was already 1 oÂ’clock
in the afternoon.
They then took a siesta. But he woke up with a headache and feeling
nauseated. He couldn't move and realized his body was paralyzed. He turned
to his sleeping children and saw them turning red. They wouldn't wake up.
He screamed for help until neighbors came and brought them to the hospital.
[The man] and his three other children, 8, 6, and 4 were all confined at
the Bicol Regional Training and Teaching Hospital. But his youngest, a
three-year-old was beyond help.

[My first thought was botulism, but the incubation period is probably too
short. Further information concerning the diagnosis or official responses
to prevent further poisoning incidents would be appreciated. - Mod.ES]
