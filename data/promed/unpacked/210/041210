Malaria parasites identified in Loudoun Mosquitoes
-----------------------------
Health authorities say they have discovered malaria-carrying mosquitoes in
2 Loudoun County neighborhoods, several miles from where 2 teenagers became
ill with the disease in a rare outbreak over the summer.
The finding marks the first time in at least 20 years that mosquitoes
carrying the parasite have been identified in a U.S. community where humans
were also infected with malaria, according to Richard W. Steketee, chief of
the malaria epidemiology branch of the federal Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention in Atlanta. Federal and state authorities said they would do
more tests on the Loudoun insects to confirm the results.
"Having 2 cases of domestically transmitted malaria, and finding 2 pools of
positive mosquitoes, hasn't happened for decades in the U.S.," said David
Goodfriend, director of Loudoun's health department. Officials in Maryland,
less than a mile from one of the infected mosquito pools in Loudoun, have
arranged for a military team of malaria experts to help eradicate other
infected mosquitoes, according to Lynn Frank, chief of public health
services in Montgomery County. Frank said and for the first time, officials
will test mosquitoes trapped in Montgomery for malaria.
Health officials emphasized that the strain of malaria-causing parasite
found this week in mosquitoes near the Potomac triggers a highly
unpleasant, but comparatively mild, form of malaria [_Plasmodium vivax_]
that can be easily treated -- not the strain that kills millions of people
in the developing world. The findings have prompted additional anti-malaria
measures, including more larvicide application in areas where mosquitoes
breed and new traps. Additional adult mosquito spraying is also under
consideration. Mother Nature also could offer help in the battle,
authorities said. As the weather gets cooler, fewer people spend long
periods of time outside, and the onset of winter should also kill off many
mosquitoes. One of the pools of infected insects was found this week at the
Lansdowne development east of Leesburg, about 6-1/2 miles from the Cascades
and Sugarland Run areas, where the teenagers who were infected lived.
Another pool was found along a waterway called Broad Run, about 2 miles
away -- and 4 miles from where the teenagers lived. Goodfriend said the
malarial mosquitoes found this week probably were different from the ones
that infected the teenagers, since the anopheline mosquitoes that transmit
the disease usually don't fly more than about a half mile. Officials also
believe that someone other than the 2 teenagers already identified was the
source of the parasites in the mosquitoes discovered this week. But no
other human cases of malaria have come to light. "There is malaria out
there, and we have to pay attention to it," the CDC's Steketee said. "It's
rare, but it's not a non-problem." Clarke Mosquito Control, the company
Loudoun has hired to trap mosquitoes, found the first pool of
malaria-infected mosquitoes Wednesday in a trap that was set up at the
request of a local retirement community concerned about West Nile. The
technicians crushed the 4 [mosquitoes] and used the same test used overseas
by the U.S. military and international agencies to identify malaria. It was
positive. Local and state officials in Maryland requested help from
specialists at the Uniform Services University of the Health Sciences, the
Bethesda-based academic health center for the military. The school is
sending a team of malaria experts to help Maryland and Virginia officials
develop a comprehensive strategy to monitor and fight the outbreak, said
Frank of Montgomery.

[It is not surprising that mosquitoes tested positive. _Plamodium vivax_
produce gametocytes -­ the form that infect the mosquito -­ at the same
time the patients become ill, and the 2 patients therefore most likely have
infected some mosquitoes before being treated. The positive finding of
malaria-infected mosquitoes could also indicate that immune carriers were
or are present in the community, unknowingly infecting mosquitoes. The best
guarantee against a continued risk of malaria is the coming of autumn and
winter, as the parasite cannot develop in the mosquito when it gets cooler.
