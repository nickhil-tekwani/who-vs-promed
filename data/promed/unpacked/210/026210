[There is very little to go on here. However, knowing they collected wild mushrooms is likely the problem. It can be very easy to misidentify a mushroom, and hence have a toxic variety instead of a safe, tasty morsel.

There are no clinical signs, and although not specified, I guess stomach upset may be one sign. Consequently, it becomes impossible to make a suggestion regarding which mushroom it may have been. - Mod.TG
