The deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu has been discovered in western
Kazakhstan, officials said on Wednesday [22 Mar 2006].
"Cases of highly pathological bird flu [H5N1] have been confirmed by
laboratory tests in a dead wild bird from the Caspian shore
[Mangistau province]," an official at the Kazakh agriculture ministry
said on Wednesday.
No cases of humans contracting bird flu have been reported in
Kazakhstan, which saw an outbreak of the disease in animals in the
north of the country in August 2005.
In an effort to stave off outbreaks in domestic birds, preventive
measures are already under way in western Kazakhstan, including mass
vaccination of domestic birds, particularly backyard poultry. "As of
Wednesday, 32 800 domestic fowl have been vaccinated against the
highly pathogenic avian influenza in the area," the agriculture
ministry official stated.
Asylbek Kozhimuratov, head of the Kazakh agriculture ministry, said
that all domestic poultry had been vaccinated in Mangistau province.
Vaccination is under way in another western province, Atyrau, which
is believed to be vulnerable to the virus [northeast of the Caspian
Sea; see map
<http://www.supertravelnet.com/maps/index.php?action=showmap&country=189_0_4&language=1>].
Some 40 000 doses of vaccine have been provided for that purpose,
according to the ministry.
Kazakh authorities have not yet resorted to mass culling of poultry
in the area. "There has not been any culling of domestic birds
because avian flu has been registered only in wild birds so far,"
ministry officials said.
But officials have called for people to take care to prevent
transmission of the virus. "People should follow hygiene norms and
avoid contact with wild birds; especially they should prevent their
children from such contact," Kozhimuratov added.

[Data on the species of the affected wild birds will be helpful, as
well as confirmation and details from a reference laboratory.
Kazakhstan's population exceeds 16 million; according to FAO
statistics, in 2005 the egg-production industry exceeded 13 million
laying hens. The term "mass vaccination" within a population of such
magnitude is not applicable if -- as reported -- 32 800 domestic fowl
have been vaccinated.
It will be interesting to obtain details (producer, viral strains
included) of the vaccine and the vaccination regime applied. - Mod.AS]

Veterinary officials confirmed a bird-flu outbreak in poultry near
Romania's capital, the Bucharest Daily News reported Wednesday.
The officials said dead poultry found in a village near the capital
were infected with the H5N1 strain of avian influenza and immediately
ordered quarantine in the area.
Disinfection checkpoints were set up around Magurele in Ilfov County,
about 50 miles southwest of Bucharest, and the officials began
testing for bird-flu virus in other poultry.
In the meantime, quarantine was lifted in 3 areas of Constanta
County, on the Black Sea coast.
The total number of bird flu outbreaks in Romania was about 50. Apart
from thousands of birds already destroyed, the officials said more
than 100 000 birds would be killed to stop the bird flu virus from spreading.

[3] Israel (Jordan valley), turkeys: 7th outbreak

The Agriculture Ministry said on Thursday that dead birds found in a
poultry coop in the Jordan Valley tested positive for the deadly
strain of avian flu, confirming the virus was continuing to spread
across the country.
The ministry's announcement was based on interim results from the
test that indicated it was highly probable the virus was of the
[virulent] strain. The tests, however, were not completed at the time
of the announcement.
Moshav Beqaot was quarantined Wednesday after dozens of turkeys were
found dead, and Thursday morning the Veterinary Services began
culling the flocks in the 4 poultry coops in the community.
These are the only coops in a 3-km radius from the moshav, therefore
culling will not take place in nearby communities. The Veterinary
Service imposed a 10-km-radius quarantine in the area.
Israel has culled some 400 000 infected turkeys and chickens since
discovering the bird flu virus in southern Israel last week. Infected
farms have been isolated and Israel is planning to compensate farmers
[economically hurt] by the virus.

[The laboratory confirmation of the 7th outbreak, in Beqaot, might be
surprising given the low mortality initially observed. But it seems
that H5N1 mortality might begin gradually. Such was the case in the
outbreak described in yesterday's (22 Mar 2006) update, according to
data kindly provided by Dr Beny Perelman (whose name was regrettably
omitted). Increased mortality was first observed in 1 out of 10
chicken houses. The affected house contained 16 000 broilers;
mortality increased from 10 birds per day to 400 the next day and to
more than 800 by the following day. Speedy diagnosis is crucial to
enable culling during early stages of the outbreak, preventing peak
viral emission.
According to the provisions of the Animal Disease Ordinance,
compensations for culled animals cover only direct losses (namely
their market value), not indirect costs such as lost income,
out-of-production period, disinfection costs, etc. For healthy or
suspected-but-not-confirmed culled animals, full compensation is
paid; if the culled animals are infected, only half the prescribed
compensation is payable by law. Obviously this policy breeds heated
deliberations and may cause delays. To obtain realistic compensation
(which will ensure early and reliable notifications of suspect
cases), the poultry breeders' union has demanded that the government
officially proclaim the AI outbreak "a national nature disaster",
allowing realistic compensations.
According to plan, by the end of the week, Israel will have destroyed
about 1 million birds. - Mod.AS]

[4] Albania, poultry: H5N1 confirmed

Albania found its 2nd case of H5N1 bird flu in poultry near the
capital, but there was no evidence the virus had made people ill,
despite [the fact that] some farmers had eaten infected birds,
officials said on Thursday.
The Agriculture Ministry said tests at a British laboratory at
Weybridge confirmed H5N1 in 4 dead chickens in the Peze Helmes area,
some 10 km (6 miles) west of the capital Tirana.
Ministry spokesman Rexhep Shahu said teams were working to cull some
600 chickens and disinfect the coops in the area. "Tests have found
no sign of the virus in people," he said.
Albania confirmed its 1st case of H5N1 3 weeks ago in a chicken in
the southern Sarande region, near the Greek border.
The villagers in Peze Helmes said they had eaten some of their
chickens recently, thinking they died of other causes.
"We don't know what to do. We see the Prime Minister on television,
chicken leg in hand, inviting us to eat them," one villager said.
"Now we are told to kill them. Why? Were the ones he ate better ones?"
The bird flu virus has spread rapidly since the beginning of
February, and is now present in most European countries. Although
essentially an animal disease, bird flu has killed more than 100
people since 2003.
The vast majority of human cases have become infected by direct
contact with infected live or dead poultry. The World Health
Organisation says there is no evidence that the disease can be
transmitted to humans through properly cooked food.
A local vet said many households slaughtered the birds and ate them
despite official advice to bury them and disinfect the area. All
residents of the village had blood samples taken.
The bird flu scare has caused Albanian sales of chicken meat to fall
by 80 percent. A truck with covered number plates dumped 80 chickens
in a ditch on the road by the road to Albania's international airport
on Wednesday.

All states have been ordered to conduct comprehensive sampling of
birds nationwide following the discovery of 3 new bird flu cases in
Perak yesterday. "Previously, sampling was done in affected areas
only, but now it has to be carried out in all states," Agriculture
and Agro-Based Industry Minister Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin said in the
Parliament lobby.
The latest bird flu cases were detected in Kampung Changkat Legong
near Gopeng, at the Titi Gantung Agriculture Training Institute in
Bota, and at Taman Lapangan Perdana in Ipoh. Muhyiddin said Malaysia
was no longer exempt from the avian flu virus. "We are worried about
the rapid spread of the virus. We have intensified our contingency
plan to control the situation," he said.
Muhyiddin believed that migratory birds were the likely cause of
avian flu infection in Malaysia, which compounded efforts to contain
the spread, as it is near impossible to control migratory birds. One
preventive measure, he said, was banning the slaughter of poultry in
wet markets and in the open. So far, no one has been infected in
Malaysia. The minister said the Federal Territory and Perak
governments had approved the ban on open slaughtering of
poultry. "The states, which have the power to stop open
slaughtering, should do so before it's too late," he said.
In the meantime, the ministry will step up its education and
awareness campaigns on bird flu among villagers, as the cases have
been found in villages and not commercial farms. "We will also
discuss with the state governments whether all birds in their
villages should be culled," he added. Muhyiddin said there was a
manpower shortage in his ministry but other departments and agencies
were helping out. "Our personnel have been stretched to the limit
working day and night." He said he would ask the Cabinet to increase
the number of virologists to ensure faster results from sample tests.
"It now takes about 2-3 days -- and is still manageable. But we don't
want to wait 2-3 weeks if we have tens of thousands of samples coming
in," he said. Muhyiddin said he would meet Dr Chua tomorrow to
discuss further measures.

The 3 cases of bird flu detected in Perak yesterday were the latest
in a series of outbreaks since the first was discovered in Setapak,
Kuala Lumpur, in February 2006. Swab samples taken from live birds in
Kampung Changkat Legong near Gopeng tested positive for the deadly H5N1 virus.
"2 free-range chickens in the village were found infected following
random testing within the 10-km radius of Kampung Changkat Tualang,
where avian flu was first detected in the state," Perak Agriculture,
Agro-based Industry and Tourism Committee chairman Datuk Mohd Radzi
Manan told newsmen at Kampung Changkat Legong yesterday.
The virus was also found in 6 samples of broiler chicken within the
Titi Gantung Agriculture Training Institute in Bota, and in samples
taken from dead burung gembala kerbau (cattle egret) in Taman
Lapangan Perdana in Ipoh. "One of the 2 dead cattle egrets, which
were discovered by Taman Lapangan Perdana residents, tested positive
for the H5N1 virus. The state Veterinary Services Department is still
investigating the origins of the dead birds," he said, adding that
all test results were released on Monday night.
Results of random tests conducted on birds and poultry in other parts
within the 10-km radius of Kampung Changkat Tualang since last week
had yet to come back, he added. Kampung Changkat Legong village head
Othman Isa said there had been no report of sick chickens from the
300 villagers. "If not for the test results, we would not have known
that our chickens had been infected. They look so lively and strong,"
he said hours before the culling exercise of 1500 free-range chickens
in the village.
At the Titi Gantung Agriculture Training Institute, veterinary
officers culled 1000 poultry and 800 quails.
In Ipoh, state veterinary officer Dr Wan Mohd Kamil Wan Nik said
culling would not be carried out at Taman Lapangan Perdana, as the
origin of the dead egrets could not be determined. He urged pet
owners and those who rear poultry within their compounds to alert the
authorities (Tel: 05-546 1322) of any dead or sick animals.
In Butterworth, the health authorities are monitoring areas within a
10-km radius of Permatang Bogak in northern Seberang Perai.
Deputy Agriculture and Agro-Based Industry Minister Datuk Seri Mohd
Shariff Omar said the areas included Kepala Batas, Bumbung Lima,
Tasek Gelugor, Pongsu Seribu, Teluk Air Tawar, Penaga, Bagan Ajam,
and Sungai Dua.
