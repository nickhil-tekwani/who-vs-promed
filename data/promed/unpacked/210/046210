Unpasteurized Milk Causes E. Coli Infections in 2 Metro Detroit Kids, Authorities Say
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two metro Detroit children have been infected with _E. coli_, authorities said Friday, 26 Aug 2016. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services [MDHHS] says the transmission was from ingestion of unpasteurized milk. The separate cases have been reported in Oakland and Wayne counties. Officials are now reminding residents of the potential risks associated with consuming raw milk.

Symptoms include stomach cramps and vomiting. Most people get better within one week, but serious complications can develop [such as kidney failure and seizures - Mod.LL].

Share programs exist where members own part of a cow and in return receive raw milk. These programs are not inspected or regulated and are not available in stores. "The public should be aware that raw milk and other unpasteurized dairy products have not been heat treated and, therefore, pose a potentially serious risk to human health," said Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive for MDHHS.

[Although not specifically stated, the _E. coli_ is most likely to be an enterohemorrhagic serotype such as O157:H7. Unlike most _E. coli_, these organisms are zoonotic and can be transmitted from raw milk and other unpasteurized dairy products.

In the March 2012 issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (Langer AJ, Ayers T, Grass J, et al: Nonpasteurized dairy products, disease outbreaks, and state laws -- United States, 1993-2006. Emerg Infect Dis. 2012; 18(3): 385-91 http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/3/11-1370_article), the authors report on 121 foodborne outbreaks (with 4413 cases of reported illness) caused by contaminated dairy products, and 73 (60 percent) were involved with unpasteurized dairy products. 65 (54 percent) involved cheese (42 percent made from unpasteurized milk) and 56 involved fluid milk (82 percent involved unpasteurized milk). In these outbreaks, _Campylobacter_ spp was responsible for 54 percent of the outbreaks, followed by _Salmonella_ spp (22 percent), enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (13 percent), _Brucella_ spp (4 percent), _Listeria_ (4 percent), and _Shigella_ spp (3 percent).

Clearly, pasteurized milk can also transmit disease, and 48 outbreaks were reported. The source of contamination was reported in only 7 (14 percent), of which at least 4 resulted from post-pasteurization contamination by an infected food handler.

The reader is directed to the article for additional information and discussion.

Classical zoonotic organisms such as _Brucella abortus_, _Brucella melitensis_, _Mycobacterium bovis_, _Salmonella_ species, _Listeria monocytogenes_, _Campylobacter_ species, _Yersinia_ species, _Coxiella burnetii_, and _E. coli_ O157:H7 are associated with the ingestion of raw milk. Non-zoonotic organisms such as _Streptococcus pyogenes_, _Salmonella_ Typhi, _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_, _Shigella_ spp, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi A, _Salmonella_ Paratyphi B, enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and hepatitis A have also been associated with the ingestion of raw milk. - Mod.LL
