INFECTION CONTROL - MASSACHUSETTS, USA & REQUEST FOR INFO
=========================================================
Date: Tue, 4 Jun 1996 09:43:55 EST5EDT
From: "David Hamer" <dhamer@HIID.HARVARD.EDU>

I serve as the director of Infection Control for Spaulding
Rehabilitation Hospital in Boston, MA. Admissions to our facility
largely consist of referrals from other hospitals in the Boston area,
mostly from the large Harvard, Tufts, and Boston U. teaching
facilities. As all of these institutions have growing problems with
multiresistant bacteria, our facility serves as a catchment center
for resistant organisms (like a large fish high up in the feeding
chain with progressive accumulation and concentration of heavy metals
in their tissues). Consequently, we have growing problem with MRSA
and VRE.
One year ago, we had an average of 10 patients with MRSA in
the hospital at any one time whereas now we have about 25. The
number of patients with VRE at any one time has rapidly escalated
from 5 to 15 in the same time period. The vast majority of these
individuals are found (by screening) to be infected or colonized at
the time of admission. We also have intermittent eruptions of
_C. difficile_ and sporadic cases of highly resistant gram-negative
bacilli. Penicillin-resistant pneumococci are fortunately rare.
*************REQUEST
The explosion in cases of MRSA and VRE has placed a significant
burden on the hospital in terms of expenses related to isolation
precautions and microbiology lab time. Any input on how to cope with
this growing menace would be appreciated.
