FMD situation update
--------------------
The spread is steadily slowing down, but new towns and cities with
non-vaccinated animals are affected. Japan is in the rainy season and
heavy rain in Miyazaki seems to delay the quarantine work.

As of 21 Jun 2010, the total number of PCR-confirmed outbreaks [cases]
was 291.
The number of destroyed animals, accumulated until 21 Jun 2010, was:
162 174 swine, 37 102 cattle, 17 goats and sheep.

Foot-and-mouth outbreak hits trucking firms, accommodation facilities
in Miyazaki
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two months after the 1st case of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] was
reported in Miyazaki Prefecture, the disease has not only devastated
the prefecture's livestock industry, but is also wreaking havoc on
trucking and tourism-related businesses.

In the Miyazaki Prefecture town of Kunitomi roughly 30 km [approx 20
mi] southwest of Kawaminami, where many cases were reported, around 10
trucks sit in the parking lot of a company that transports feed for
cows.

"We're uncertain about the future. If this doesn't end quickly, then
our company won't last," the firm's 52-year-old president said in a
bitter tone as he gazed out a window to the empty trucks.

The company picks up feed sent over from Australia and other locations
at Shibushi Port in Kagoshima Prefecture, and carries it to farms in
central Miyazaki Prefecture. Since the outbreak of FMD, the number of
cattle being slaughtered has increased, and orders for feed have
dropped. Sales in June [2010] were reportedly about 30 to 40 percent
of the previous year's [2009] figure.

Amid the adverse conditions, the firm receives a call from a
tired-sounding farmer in the affected area, asking for feed to be
brought out. Workers disinfect a truck, which heads out to the
hard-hit area. "If we don't take them feed right up until the end, who
will?" a company member asks.

In a Miyazaki Prefectural Government survey of 620 commercial and
industrial companies in central Miyazaki Prefecture, 85 percent of the
companies said they had suffered poorer sales or other adverse effects
from the outbreak. Two-thirds of firms in the transportation industry
said their sales had fallen anywhere from 30 percent or more to 70
percent or more.

"We are seeing financial damage from harmful rumors like, 'Vehicles
with Miyazaki number plates are not allowed in or out' which has
extended even to trucks carrying vegetables or pianos out of the
prefecture," a representative of the Miyazaki Trucking Association said.

The tourism industry has also been affected. Figures from the
178-member Miyazaki Hotel Ryokan Organization show that accommodation
and conferences for 34 000 people were cancelled over a period of
about one month after the outbreak, causing a loss of 265 million yen
[2.92 million USD] in bookings. "If you added souvenirs and meals that
figure would be 10 times greater," the association's secretary general
said.

Even tours to the Miyazaki Prefectural Government headquarters, which
entered the spotlight with the appearance of Miyazaki Gov. Hideo
Higashikokubaru, have been affected. Before the outbreak, an average
of 1500 visitors arrived each day, but that figure now stands at
around 400 -- nearly one-quarter. On 1 Jun 2010, just 64 visitors -- a
record low -- turned up.
