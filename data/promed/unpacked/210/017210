BSE in Japan - fourth case (OIE Emergency Report)
-------------------------------------------------
Dr Toshikazu Ijichi, director of Animal Health Division, Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo, reported on 13 May 2002 that a
Holstein cow aged 6 years and one month kept on a dairy farm in Shiranuka
Gun, Hokkaido Prefecture was slaughtered at the abattoir on 10 May 2002.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
bov / 56 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 1
The brain sample from the cow tested positive to the enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay based bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) screening
test required by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for all cattle
slaughtered at abattoirs since 18 Oct 2001. The test was carried out at
Hokkaido Prefectural Kushiro Public Health Center, Kushiro City, Hokkaido
Prefecture.
The brain sample was sent to the Obihiro University of Agriculture and
Veterinary Medicine,Obihiro City, Hokkaido Prefecture for confirmation,
where western blot analysis and immunohistochemical examination yielded a
positive result on 12 May 2002.
The source of agent/origin of infection are under investigation.
Control measures are as follows. The dairy farm in Hokkaido Prefecture
where the BSE case was found has been placed under movement control by the
Kushiroe Livestock Hygiene Service Centre. All animals that were kept with
the infected cow [are being/have been] identified. The feed used on the
farm, as a possible source of infection, is being subjected to
epidemiological investigation.
Note from the OIE Central Bureau: This is the fourth BSE case reported in
Japan. As from now, any further cases of BSE in Japan will no longer be
notified in Disease Information but will immediately be incorporated into
the table on the number of reported cases of BSE worldwide (excluding the
United Kingdom), which can be consulted on the OIE website
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/en_esbmonde.htm>.
[Japan's official report on its first BSE case, sent on 10 Sep 2001,
indicated that the nature of the diagnosis was "clinical and laboratory";
in their initial, preliminary report of 10 Sept 2001, and mentioned
dystaxia of the suspected cow. In all 3 subsequent cases (reported to OIE
on 22 Nov 2002, 05 Dec 2002, and 13 May 2002) the nature of diagnosis was
indicated as "laboratory". However, the Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun,
reporting on the fourth case on 13 May 2002, said that "veterinarians, on
Thu (09 May 2002), diagnosed the cow with a suspected case of neural
paralysis in the left front leg".

We hope the Japanese authorities will be able to shed more light on the
clinical aspects of the last 3 cases. - Mod.AS].

UK agency to review "over 30 month" rule for BSE control
--------------------------------------------------------
The British Food Standards Agency (FSA) is to review the "over 30 month"
(OTM) rule, which currently prohibits the sale of meat for human
consumption from cattle aged over 30 months at slaughter. This rule was
introduced in 1996 and has had a major impact on reducing the risk to
public health by significantly limiting the number of BSE infected animals
which might otherwise have entered the food chain. The review will consider
whether any changes to the rule could be made without increasing the risk
to public health.
Other measures such as the "specified risk material" (SRM) controls are to
remain as they are. The SRM rule specifies that the parts of cattle most
likely to carry BSE infectivity (including brain tissue and spinal cord)
must be removed before they enter the food chain. The FSA's review of BSE
controls, published in December 2000, recommended that the OTM rule be
reviewed in 2002 in the light of the overall decline in BSE in the UK and
specifically the impact of the tightened feed controls in 1996.
Sir John Krebs, chairman of the FSA, said: "The agency's primary concern is
to protect the consumer from BSE risk. As with all the BSE controls, this
rule should be maintained for as long as it is needed to protect public
health. But it is right to update our assessment and management of risk in
light of the latest scientific evidence. We will be seeking advice from the
top experts." A joint FSA/SEAC (Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory
Committee) risk assessment group will provide scientific input to the
review. Professor Peter Smith, the chairman of SEAC, will chair this group.
SEAC provides independent expert scientific advice to government on BSE
issues. The group's risk assessment will be considered by SEAC.
The FSA will hold 2 public meetings; firstly, to gather views and concerns
from stakeholders about the review, secondly, to consult on any proposals
for change that come out of the review. Recommendations will be submitted
to the agency's board and its decisions will form the basis of advice to
ministers.
Duncan Sinclair, a beef market analyst from the British Meat and Livestock
Commission, said that if the regulation is relaxed and animals born after
2000 are allowed on to the market, then an additional 60 000 prime cattle a
year would enter the market. "A gradual transition back to normal is the
preferred route," he said. He added that with the opening up of
third-country export trade there would be no real risk of flooding the
market, and that if the scheme is relaxed it would mean that all cattle
over 30 months that are slaughtered would be tested for BSE. At present
these cattle are destroyed and do not enter the food chain.

Agency consults on BSE and sheep report
---------------------------------------
The BSE Stakeholders' Group has advised the Food Standards Agency board on
new precautionary measures against the theoretical risk of BSE in sheep.
The agency's advice to consumers is unchanged. It is not advising against
the consumption of lamb, mutton, and goat meat. This applies to all age
groups, including babies or other groups who may be considered vulnerable.
The group (made up of scientists, farming, food industry, and consumer
group representatives) considered risk reduction measures that would be
proportionate to what remains a theoretical risk.
Against a background of scientific uncertainty, their report recommends the
following precautionary measures:
-- seek European Community-wide removal of all sheep intestine pending
further investigation of the effectiveness of sausage casings processing in
removing potential sources of infectivity;
-- communicate the higher theoretical risk of infectivity in mutton and
goat meat from older animals to communities which are more likely to eat
such meats (namely Muslim and African-Caribbean communities). Doing so
would enable them to make their own informed choices. The Muslim community,
for instance, eats around 20 per cent of sheep meat, most of which is
mutton. The African-Caribbean community is known to eat goat meat;
-- continue to advise consumers as a whole on the theoretical risk,
including the advice that if BSE were present in sheep, eating lamb rather
than mutton is likely to reduce the risk;
-- provide parallel advice and information to organizations catering for
infants and children (such as local authorities, schools, and nurseries) so
they can make their own informed choices;
-- seek agreement from the baby food industry to introduce voluntary
country of origin labelling for baby food containing lamb, so that parents
have maximum choice to select from other countries if they wish. The agency
should ask the European Community to accelerate the country by country BSE
risk categorization;
-- set a clear priority for the development of a rapid diagnostic test for
BSE in sheep. The agency has already highlighted the urgent need to develop
a validated rapid test to detect the possible presence of BSE in sheep.
FSA chair, Sir John Krebs, said: "Ongoing studies of the current sheep
flock indicate that no sheep have tested positive for BSE. However, this is
an evolving area of science and there are considerable uncertainties. While
no sheep alive today are likely to have been exposed to any original source
of infectivity, the theoretical risk that BSE could be present in sheep by
virtue of transmission, and masked by scrapie, remains.
"The Board of the Agency will examine this report very carefully in
deciding what further measures are appropriate in dealing with the
theoretical risk of BSE in sheep. We need to make proportionate choices in
acting on what continues to be a precautionary basis. This report does not
change the agency's advice, which remains that we are not advising against
the consumption of lamb and mutton."
The report is published for public consultation and will be considered,
along with responses, at the agency's board meeting on 13 Jun 2002.

Fears over BSE in chicken
-------------------------
Fears that the infectious prion proteins that cause BSE could be present in
chicken fillets have been raised after bovine protein was found in breast
fillets tested by the Irish Food Safety Authority (FSAI).
The tests on Dutch imports follow a report by the United Kingdom's Food
Standards Agency in Dec 2001 that undeclared pig proteins had been used to
"bulk up" chicken from Holland and Belgium. The FSAI also found undeclared
hydrolysed collagen in 26 per cent of the chicken fillets. Species-specific
DNA tests on 30 chicken samples then revealed that 17 contained bovine DNA,
porcine DNA, or both. As yet, the authorities have been unable to trace the
source of the undeclared bovine material. Peter Smith, chairman of SEAC,
the UK government's advisory body on BSE and its human form, variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in ProMED-mail as (vCJD) or cjd (new
var.)], told New Scientist: "If the source of the bovine material was fit
for human consumption under EU regulations, then these findings pose no
significant health risk. The problem is we don't know."
It is not illegal to add proteins to chicken, provided the additives are
included in labelling of the meat. Protein additives are often extracted
from old animals, which are not suitable for sale as meat, or from body
parts such as skin, bones and ligaments. But this process does not destroy
prions, the infectious proteins that cause BSE.
Wayne Anderson, chief food scientist at FSAI, told the Guardian newspaper
that there is a theoretical risk of BSE contamination. "The presence of
bovine proteins in chicken is disgusting. What if it is material not
controlled under the EU's specified risk material restrictions?" he says.
However, FSAI's director, Alan Reilly, was anxious to play down the risk.
He told New Scientist: "There may be many explanations for the bovine
material, but we won't know until the Dutch authorities come back and tell us.
"It is possible the bovine DNA signal is due to casein, a protein found in
milk, which is often added to chicken and not linked to BSE," he says. "And
the collagen protein could be from chicken skin." But Reilly confirmed that
bovine DNA had been found in all the samples containing collagen.
Yvonne Huigen, a spokesperson from the Inspectorate for Health Protection
in the Netherlands, says Dutch officials are trying to identify the source
of the bovine additive. She said, however, that there was no reason to
restrict chicken exports: "At the moment we are dealing with a labelling
problem, it is not a health problem."

BSE - Scientific Steering Committee publishes new advice
---------------------------------------------------------
Brussels: The Scientific Steering Committee (SSC), which advises the
European Commission on BSE related issues among other things, on 22 May
2002 published an opinion adopted at its meeting last week, which examined
the current age of 12 months for the removal from the human food chain of
the bovine vertebral column ("T-bone").
For animals born after the implementation of the feed ban, the SSC
confirmed its opinion of 12 Jan 2001 that such animals bear a low risk of
BSE infection provided that feed ban has been, and continues to be,
properly implemented and enforced. The SSC took the view that neither the
available research results nor the results of the 2001 rapid BSE testing
programme supported raising the age limit for bovine animals born before
the feed ban came into force. The SSC asked member states to assess the
human exposure risk before and after the implementation of risk management
measures, including the total feed ban. The SSC will then be in a position
to revisit and update its opinion on human BSE risk related to specified
risk material (SRMs).
The European Commission considers that this advice opens the possibility to
start discussions with the member states on raising the age limit for the
removal of vertebral column in cattle born after the new feed ban. This
discussion will have to take account of evidence on the effective
enforcement of the ban.
The SSC also updated its assessments of the geographical BSE risk in
Austria and Finland and concluded that both countries should remain
classified as GBR III, which means that BSE is present at a low level.
However, in both countries the internal system is considered to be secure
and the risk of new infection of cattle born after the total feed ban of
2001 is very small.
The SSC adopted an opinion on the safety of bovine embryos and the safety
of animal-derived rennet. Bovine embryos are considered not to pose a risk,
provided the protocols prescribed by the International Embryo Transfer
Society (IETS) are respected. The rennet opinion addresses the variable
potential risk of animal rennet depending upon its source (bovines, small
ruminants, or pigs) and use (food or pharmaceutical).
The SSC also adopted an opinion on the efficacy in terms of TSE infectivity
of a new process for animal waste treatment by alkaline hydrolysis at
elevated temperature and pressure.

36th BSE case in the Netherlands
--------------------------------
On 13 May 2002, BSE was detected in an 8 yearold cow on a farm in Ubbergen
(Gelderland). This is the 36th BSE case in the Netherlands since 1997, and
the 8th in 2002.
The cow, Marie 49, born 9 May 1994, was slaughtered on 29 Apr 2002 in an
emergency slaughterhouse. It reacted positively to the rapid BSE test on 03
May 2002; this was confirmed in the laboratory on 13 May 2002. No clinical
signs have been observed among the other 101 cows on the farm. As usual, an
investigation is being carried out regarding the feeding on the farm, with
special reference to the feed given to the affected cow during her first
months of life.
All cows on the farm are to be destroyed. Animals that had been moved to
other farms are to be traced and destroyed as well.

New case of mad cow disease, Denmark
------------------------------------
The 8th case of BSE has been detected in Denmark. The cow, a 5 years and 6
months old red Dane dairy cow from an organic farm on the Baltic island of
Bornholm, was slaughtered on 25 Apr 2002. The case was discovered by
routine testing at slaughter. The sampled brain tissue tested positive at
Steins Laboratory and was forwarded to the National Veterinary Institute in
Copenhagen for confirmation. The cow was born and lived its entire life on
the same dairy farm of 127 milkers and 127 calves.
Following the final confirmation of the diagnosis, all animals on the farm
were destroyed, as well as 46 other animals that had been sold to 12 farms
in Denmark. In addition, all bovines older then 24 months on these 12 farms
are to be checked for BSE [at slaughter?].
The positive slaughtered cow was destroyed together with 3 other cows at
the slaughterhouse -- one which was slaughtered immediately before her and
2 cows slaughtered after her.
The feed source on the affected farm is being investigated; the results
will be published. It has been found that no animal originating in the
affected farm has been exported.

UK warns of BSE risk from imported beef: Polish, Zimbabwean, SA cattle named
---------------------------------------
CAPE TOWN: The Food Standards Agency (FSA) of the UK warned the British
public last week that meat from Polish, Zimbabwean, and South African (SA)
cattle older than 30 months may pose a "slightly higher BSE risk" than
other imported beef sold legally.
It said that, although the amount of beef imported from Poland, Zimbabwe,
and SA was low and risk controls applied, "major retailers are already
acting to protect the public" after discussions with the agency. It said
the European Commission (EC) had already classified Poland as likely to
present a BSE risk. But no risk assessments had been carried out in SA or
Zimbabwe.
The UK has not imported beef from Zimbabwe since August 2001 because of
foot and mouth disease restrictions but the latest UK trade statistics for
2001 indicated that 29 tons of beef were imported to the UK from SA.
According to the SA Meat Industry Company (Samic) website, SA was one of
Britain's biggest beef export markets until the BSE ban. BSE and subsequent
problems like foot and mouth disease have hit British farmers hard and
there has been a strong drive in the UK to encourage British consumers to
buy from their local producers.
The FSA said it was asking the EC to expedite its risk assessments for
Zimbabwe and SA. The European Union (EU) risk categories range from 1
(highly unlikely there is a BSE risk) to 4 (BSE risk is confirmed at a high
level).
SA's Directorate of Veterinary Services forwarded a full report to the EU
in January. SA was positive it would be accepted as a beef importer to the
EU, he said.

BSE in Poland
-------------
Poland's first case of a cow infected with bovine spongiform encephalitis
(BSE) has been detected in a slaughterhouse near Krynica, Malopolska
province. The European Union will not introduce new restrictions on the
importation of Polish beef, but exports to central and eastern Europe may
become a problem, as all the Baltic states banned imports of Polish cattle,
beef, and meat products based on beef early last week.
The start of the year promised to bring a watershed in the beef market.
Unexpectedly, Polish meat exports to the former Soviet Union increased and
demand for beef also increased at home. Producers managed to win consumers'
confidence that Poland was a country free from BSE. The consequences of
discovering the first case of the disease may mean a big headache for
producers.
Many experts say the case does not alter the fact that Poland is a low risk
country for the occurrence of the disease. The EU has confirmed this
opinion. The European Commission has offered assurances that it will not
introduce new restrictions on imports of Polish beef. "The EU does not have
to be afraid of imports from Poland, because there have been strict
controls of imported meat for a long time," said Beate Gminder,
spokesperson for the EU commissioner for consumer protection.
The EU has classified Poland among "high risk BSE" countries -- category 3
on a scale of 1 to 4 [seems to contradict previous paragraph. - Mod.SH].
Only about 20 meat plants in Poland, out of 3500, have the right to export
beef to the 15 member states. They buy cattle from breeders who offer
guarantees that the animals were not fed animal-derived feed and did not
die in suspicious circumstances. Other meat plants which produce either for
the domestic market or for export to countries other than EU member states
do not offer such guarantees.
Veterinary surgeon general Piotr Kolodziejczyk said the detection of the
disease would make the Polish supervision system over the slaughter of
cattle and the safety of Polish beef more reliable in the eyes of the EU.
Still, in his opinion, the situation for producers may deteriorate due to
the lost confidence among domestic consumers. "Painting bleak scenarios may
unnecessarily provoke panic among consumers," Kolodziejczyk said. "We
already know its scope and implications from western Europe."
Beef exports to central and eastern European countries are also threatened.
Przemyslaw Chabowski, head of the Polish Union of Meat Producers, Exporters
and Importers, said that the occurrence of further outbreaks of BSE is an
unrealistic threat. But one should not forget that western cattle were
imported to Poland in the 1990s that may have been infected, he cautioned.
"If there are more outbreaks of the disease, we may witness another crisis
in the beef market," said Chabowski. "It remains unknown how foreign buyers
will behave. The situation may especially alarm companies that made
painstaking efforts to sign contracts with Ukraine and Russia."
The first repercussions caused by BSE in Poland have come from Lithuania.
The Lithuanian state service for food control and veterinary science
introduced a ban on imports of Polish beef on 6 May 2002. The head of the
Lithuanian veterinary services said a meat plant in Vilnius has imported 88
tons of beef from Poland this year, but the beef was tested and had a
safety certificate. Representatives of Polish exporters say the decision of
the Lithuanian services was political, and the BSE case in Poland was only
an excuse to introduce a ban on imports of Polish beef. Latvia, Estonia,
and Ukraine followed suit, and have banned Polish beef imports since 7 May
2002.
Poland's credibility will certainly not be helped by the fact that it is
still not known where exactly the infected cow came from. It has transpired
that the trader who supplied the cow to the slaughterhouse produced false
documents of the animal's origin.

Polish BSE cow's mother herd located
------------------------------------
Cracow: Poland's first known BSE -infected cow originally came from a herd
in Rzepiennik Strzyzewski, southern Poland, genetic experts concluded (on)
Wed, 15 May 2002.
Local officials have said that 2 other animals in the same herd known to be
related to the sick cow have also been found. All 3 animals will be put to
sleep, after which their brains will be vivisected.

[Additional data on the evolving BSE situation and related steps in Poland
have been compiled from several Polish electronic sources, mainly "Zrodlo:
Internet z dnia", 5-10 May 2002. We are very grateful to Mr Shlomo Dori for
his translations.
1. The Polish police arrested 2 people in connection with the illegal
transfer of the infected cow (a dealer and an official) accused of
documents forgery.
2. The 9 year old animal was suspected for BSE within the mass screening
testing scheme; it did not manifest clinical symptoms. The cow arrived at
the slaughterhouse with other animals probably -- but not certainly --
coming from the same farm. The fact that the cow did not carry
identification (such as ear tags) caused a long delay in the tracing of the
farm. For these investigations, genetic techniques have been applied. The
police argued that if the cow had been properly identifiable, the
investigation could be completed within minutes instead of more than 48 hours.
3. The owner insisted that he had never used meat and bone meal on his
farm. [Even if this is found to be true, it does not exclude the use of
milk-replacers].
4. The case underlined the worrisome lack of official and general
identification of cattle in Poland. A steering committee headed by the
deputy minister of agriculture has been established and is engaged in the
planning and coordination of the nationwide identification of Polish
cattle. This will include the ear tagging of each head in the national herd
with 2 ear tags, accompanied by an individual identity card. The project is
planned to become operational on 1 Sep 2002, with a budget of 20 million
Euros secured by the government. Specific new legislation will be required.
The services of an internationally recognized computer company have been
sought.
5. The authorities are to launch a campaign against illegal ("gray")
slaughter outside the slaughterhouses. - Mod.AS]
