The agriculture ministry announced on Sunday [13 Apr 2014] a suspected outbreak of bird flu that killed at least 1100 chickens at a farm in Taragi, Kumamoto Prefecture, prompting the prefectural government to order the culling of 112 000 chickens kept there and at another nearby farm run by the same operator.

The ministry also ordered a ban on the shipping or moving of chickens and their eggs within a the 3-km [1.8 mi] radius of the 2 farms, and requested that reporters not approach the farms to prevent further spread of the suspected H5-type avian influenza outbreak.

In an apparent bid to ease public concerns, government officials noted in a statement that no cases of bird-to-human bird flu infection through eating chicken meat or eggs have been found in Japan.

According to the Kumamoto prefectural government, the farmer, whose name is being withheld, first discovered 70 chickens dead on [Fri 11 Apr 2014], and another 200 on Saturday [12 Apr 2014]. The farmer then reported the events to a local office of the prefectural government, which conducted a preliminary bird flu test Saturday on 5 live chickens and another 5 dead ones [of which] one live chicken and 5 dead chickens were found positive for the H5-type of bird flu.

The prefectural government also conducted a DNA test on Sunday [13 Apr 2104] on those samples that found 2 of the 5 dead birds positive for the same strain of the virus, prompting the central government to hold a cabinet meeting and issue a warning to the public.

If confirmed, this would be the 1st bird flu outbreak in the country since one in the city of Chiba in March 2011, and the 1st-ever case at a chicken farm in Kumamoto Prefecture.

Japan has ordered the slaughter of some 112 000 chickens after officials confirmed bird flu infections at a poultry farm in the south on Sunday [13 Apr 2014]. DNA tests confirmed the H5 strain of the virus at a farm in Kumamoto prefecture that kept 56 000 birds, after its owner reported Saturday [12 Apr 2014] a lot of sudden deaths among his poultry, the agriculture ministry said in a statement.

Officials also ordered the culling of another 56 000 birds at a separate farm run by the same owner after treating it as a location of possible infections, the ministry said.

It was the 1st confirmed outbreak of bird flu in Japan in 3 years.

The ministry has however been warning farmers about infection risks, citing the continued spread of the disease in Asia, including neighbouring South Korea.

Local authorities on Saturday [12 Apr 2014] banned movement of chickens from the 2 affected farms as well as other farms in their vicinities. Authorities were sanitising areas around the 2 farms and testing birds at other area farms. Officials were also setting up areas to disinfect vehicles travelling on major roads around the affected farms to prevent the virus from spreading further.

The government will dispatch a team of officials and experts to identify the cause of the latest infections and to assist local authorities to take necessary measures.

Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga held a meeting with selected ministers, including agriculture minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, to discuss the outbreak. "The government will take thorough measures to prevent wider infections," Suga told the meeting.

Chickens infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza have been found at a poultry farm in the town of Taragi in Kumamoto Prefecture, southwestern Japan, the farm ministry said on Sunday [13 Apr 2014].

A total of some 112 000 chickens at the farm and another the same farmer operates in the village of Sagara in the prefecture will be culled to prevent the disease from spreading.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries convened a panel of experts to discuss measures to deal with the incident. While the route of the infection is still uncertain, Prof Toshihiro Ito of Tottori University, chairman of the panel, told reporters after its meeting that migratory birds may have brought bird flu viruses from South Korea hit by the disease.

The ministry also dispatched a team of experts to the farm for a full investigation. Farm minister Yoshimasa Hayashi instructed participants in a meeting of a task force set up in the ministry to enhance measures for the prevention of the disease's spread.

[South Korea suffered during January and February 2014 an epizootic of HPAI H5N8 in ducks and chickens. The most recent outbreak reportedly started on 23 Feb 2014; the epizootic is, officially, regarded as "continuing". The disease was initially observed in wild birds. All outbreaks are presented in the interactive map available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=14668.

No human infection has been reported. The recent South Korean follow-up report to the OIE included the following epidemiological comment:

"The H5N8 subtype of viruses have a series of basic amino acid at the hemagglutinin (HA) cleavage site such as LREKRRKR/GLF or LRERRRKR/GLF, which means highly pathogenic to chickens.
- The intravenous pathogenic index was 3.0, which means highly pathogenic to chickens. Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency (QIA) injected intravenously 0.1 ml of the 1/10 diluted virus into each of 10 6-week-old SPF chickens. All birds died within 24 hours.
- QIA submitted the genetic information to GenBank and submitted manuscript to scientific society (Emerging Infectious Disease, MS#EID-14-0233) about the brief situation of outbreaks and the genetic information on 27 January 2014."

For the letter in EID mentioned (reference below), addressing the genotyping of the South Korean H5N8 isolates, see item 3 in ProMED-mail posting 20140316.2336816. The Korean authors reported that the 3 viruses isolated from domestic ducks and wild birds were designated as follows:

1. A/breeder duck/Korea/Gochang1/2014 (H5N8) ("Gochang1"),
2. A/duck/Korea/Buan2/2014 (H5N8) ("Buan2"), and
3. A/Baikal Teal/Korea/Donglim3/2014 (H5N8) ("Donglim3").

There is a recent media-sourced information on HPAI H5N1 in North Korea (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140410.2396190). This event is in need of official notification including information on the laboratory tests applied. Genotyping, and confirmation of the serotyping by an international reference laboratory are anticipated.

The final serotyping results of the Japanese isolates and their pathogenicity index are expected soon.
