Avian influenza in felines
---------------------------
Re "Leopard dies from bird flu in Thailand" in ProMED-mail posting AVIAN
INFLUENZA - EASTERN ASIA (24), Fri 13 Feb 2004:
The said report is really an unusual observation, but it may not be the
first report of influenza in animals of the cat family. A paper published
in the Chinese Journal of Veterinary Science reported the isolation of
influenza A virus from specimens taken from a tiger [in 2002] that showed
clinical symptoms and died; the isolate caused severe disease and death in
experimentally infected cats (see abstract below).
Regarding the origin of the tiger virus, feeding the tiger with birds
infected with avian influenza virus should be considered one of the
possibilities. The so called "species barrier" between avian influenza
virus and mammals may be very weak, and some types of avian influenza
viruses have the potential to cross the barrier and infect other animals
directly, causing severe disease -- if those animals are exposed to
sufficient amounts of virus or through an adequate route of administration.
Consequently, the public -- especially in AI-affected rural areas -- should
be educated not to feed any animals sick or dead chickens. I believe it is
relatively common for the village farmers who breed free-range chickens to
feed their dogs, pigs, etc. their sick or dead chickens. The importance of
personal protection while handling sick or dead chicken also deserves to be
stressed.
The above-mentioned paper was published in Chinese; I have translated the
abstract into English:
XIA Xian-zhu, GAO Yu-wei, HU Rong-liang et al. The First Finding of Tiger
Influenza by Virus Isolation and Specific Gene Amplification. Chinese
Journal of Veterinary Science, March 2003, Vol. 23, No.2, Pages 107-110.
Abstract: An influenza virus-like isolate was obtained from the specimen of
a tiger [which] died [in 2002] of high fever, anorexia, and [seizures]. This
virus was confirmed to be influenza virus by characteristics of its
morphology, physiochemistry, biology, and serology.
Further analysis was performed by amplification of the specific nucleic
acid [sequence] of the influenza virus nucleoprotein gene. A 464-bp cDNA
fragment, being amplified from both the virus cell culture and the
suspension of specimens, was compared with the published sequences of
influenza virus types A, B, and C, with homology of 84.9, 35.0, and 24.8
percent, respectively, indicating that the virus is an influenza virus type
A isolate. This virus has been designated as A/tiger/Harbin/01/2002.
3 domestic cats 3 months of age were infected with the virus by intravenous
inoculation. One of the infected cats survived the infection and the other
2 were seriously sick and eventually died of the infection. The ill cats
presented similar clinical signs and pathological changes (characterized by
pneumonia) to those of the tiger.
This is the first report [demonstrating] that influenza virus type A exists
in tigers.

[Dr Zhiru Guo is gratefully acknowledged for the reference and commentary.
The information provided in the paper underlines 2 important points: first,
the alleged potential of a (probably) avian influenza virus to cross the
species barrier and infect felines. Second, the possibility that the
described influenza virus was prevalent in China's poultry during 2002. It
will be important to determine the genetic profile of this isolate and its
relationship to other isolates, and particularly to the virus involved in
the current pandemic and to strain(s) involved in human cases.

Bird flu kills exotic species
-----------------------------
After killing millions of chickens and ducks across Asia, bird flu is
feared to have jumped to more exotic species, possibly killing a leopard
and cranes in Thailand and pheasants in Taiwan.
The UN Food and Agriculture Organisation warned that the disease -- which
has killed 14 people in Vietnam and 5 in Thailand -- still has not been
controlled in several Asian countries. "Cambodia, China, Indonesia, and
Laos continue to report new outbreaks in poultry," FAO said. Around 80
million chickens have been slaughtered across Asia, excluding China, to curb
bird flu's spread, it said.
In Thailand, Minister of Natural Resources and the Environment Prapat
Panyachatraksa said Friday that tests showed that a clouded leopard died of
bird flu on 27 Jan 2004 at Khao Khiew Zoo in Chonburi province, 70 km south
of Bangkok, and a tiger fell ill but recovered [he did not say if the tiger
had been confirmed as a case].
The World Health Organization said that if confirmed, this could be the
first known case of the disease found in an exotic animal or a member of
the cat family [See previous item]. 2 separate tests showed the leopard had
succumbed to bird flu, but the exact strain was unclear, Prapat said.
Officials were awaiting the results of a 3rd test. A zoo official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity, said the leopard might have eaten chicken infected
with bird flu. [Presumably the chicken was fed raw -- cooking kills the
virus. - Mod.JW].
Prapat also announced that tests were being carried out on more than 200
cranes that died at Bungboraphet Bird Park in Nakhon Sawan province.
In Taiwan, officials ordered a pet-bird farm in Taiwan's southern Tainan
County to kill about 300 birds, including Swinhoe's pheasants -- a
once-endangered indigenous bird with a short white crest and a blue head.
The culling was ordered after test results showed some of the birds were
infected with H5N2, a less dangerous strain of bird flu that has not jumped
to humans.
10 governments in the region have been dealing with strains of bird flu
since South Korean officials reported an outbreak in December 2003. Some
Asian countries, as well as the United States, are being hit with a milder
bird flu strain not thought to pose a danger to people.
FAO said governments in poorer countries have responded slowly to fight
bird flu because of a lack of resources, such as qualified veterinary
staff. "In addition, the urgently required administrative and political
structures to run an effective emergency campaign are often not yet in
place," it said.
On Friday, the World Bank said it would give Vietnam a USD 10 million loan
to help its poultry industry, which has been ravaged by the flu.
WHO officials have expressed concern that China may also be suffering human
cases given the broad range of poultry infections in that sprawling country,
which has confirmed avian flu in 14 of its 31 regions. China's Agriculture
Ministry reported on Friday confirmed bird flu outbreaks in fowl in 7 more
locations, including Shanghai.

Thai zoo isolates pandas over bird flu concerns
-----------------------------------------------
A zoo in northern Thailand has isolated 2 endangered giant pandas over
fears they may catch bird flu after a leopard in another zoo is believed to
have died from the disease, officials said Saturday. The pandas are
healthy. But authorities are worried that scores of chickens scampering
freely around the Chiang Mai Zoo in the country's north may sicken the
pandas if the birds are infected with bird flu, the zoo's director Tanapat
Pongpamorn said. Workers at the zoo were trying to keep wild roosters and
hens from coming close to the pandas, Tanapat said. "Those chickens were born
in the wild. They roam the zoo everywhere,"he said. "We're doing our best."
He said veterinarians were checking the health of the pandas regularly and
discussing the results with Chinese experts. The pandas have been rented
from China for 10 years for USD 250 000.
Last month, officials ordered the closure of the bird sections at zoos
across the country over bird flu concerns after the carcasses of 2 crows
that tested positive for the virus were found near a flamingo cage at
Bangkok's Dusit Zoo.
Natural Resources and the Environment Minister Prapat Panyachatraksa said
Friday that more test results were being awaited to confirm the exact type
of bird flu the leopard had. Based on early tests, it was not clear whether
the leopard had the same variety of avian flu that has infected people, or
a milder strain.
The World Health Organization said it had little information about the
case, but if confirmed, it could be the first known time the disease has
jumped to exotic animals or members of the cat family. [But see first item in
this posting].
