Last of Eastern Cape's infected ostriches culled
-----------------------------------------------
The last 2000 ostriches infected with bird flu have been culled, and tests
are now under way to establish whether the Eastern Cape is finally free of
the deadly virus. The culling brings the total number of ostriches
slaughtered since the outbreak of the disease in August 2004 to around 27
000, more than half of the ostrich population in the province.
The infected ostriches slaughtered last week [3rd week of December 2004]
were on 3 farms in the Graaff-Reinet district, said national agriculture
department spokesman Segoati Mahlangu. Should no more infected birds be
found, the export ban on ostrich meat may be lifted by around June 2005.
"We are now busy with re-stocking trials on one of the infected farms to
establish whether or not the area is now free of the virus," said Mahlangu.
"As soon as the tests are completed in January [2005] -- and the results
are positive -- farmers will be allowed to start re-stocking farms. The EU
ban stipulates that 6 months must expire from when the last infected bird
was culled before the ban may be lifted, and we will therefore continue our
surveillance of the Eastern Cape, as well as the rest of the country," he said.
Oudtshoorn-based Ostrich Business Chamber general manager Anton Kruger said
the huge impact of the disease had been softened somewhat by the increase
in local demand for ostrich meat. "This has left us with the challenge to
ensure that the local demand continues to be met when the export ban is
eventually lifted. "It will take the farmers who had to cull their birds
between 3 to 5 years to recover from the disaster," he said.
