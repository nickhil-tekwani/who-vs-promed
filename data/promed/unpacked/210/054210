Lambs in Republic linked to suspect NI farm
--------------------------------------------
Lambs processed at a Co Roscommon factory last Tuesday are from the same
load identified by the Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister yesterday as
likely to test positive for Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD). The 248 lambs
processed at the plant are believed to have passed through the farm at
Meigh, Co Armagh, which the Northern authorities believe contain a positive
case of the disease.
Last night, Ms. Brid Rodgers, the Northern Minister for Agriculture,
confirmed following preliminary tests at Meigh that she believed the
suspect sheep had suffered from the disease. A Department of Agriculture
spokesman in Dublin said last night their investigators believe the sheep
came into the Republic from the Co Armagh farm which was supplied from Britain.
The statement came following an admission from Kepak, Athleague, that the
248 lambs delivered to it on 20 Feb 2001 were not the property of the
farmer in whose name they were supplied. It said it had been told by
Department of Agriculture investigators on Monday the lambs may have
originated in Northern Ireland or the UK.
As a result the Department of Agriculture placed 12 farms belonging to farm
operatives and holding pens belonging to the factory under surveillance.
The Department of Agriculture spokesman said he was still confident,
despite the link to the Armagh farm, that the disease could be kept out of
the Republic because the lambs had only been on the premises for a few
hours before being slaughtered.
The Northern authorities said a consignment of 200 sheep was bought at a
market in Carlisle, England, over a week ago -- before the disease was
confirmed in Britain -- and transferred to Northern Ireland for slaughter.
However, Department of Agriculture officials yesterday traced a number of
them to a farm in Meigh, near Newry.
Ms. Rodgers ordered the farm, which straddles the border, to be placed
under restriction and have an 8 km surveillance zone established around it
as a precautionary measure. It is believed most of the sheep from the
suspect consignment may have ended up in the Republic.

The Northern Ireland Ministry for Agriculture has announced (13:40, 1 Mar
2001) confirmation of a case of FMD in Northern Ireland, raising fears of
the first outbreak in Northern Ireland since 1941.
The Irish Department of Agriculture is expected now to introduce stringent
controls nationwide in an attempt to prevent further spread of the disease
to the Irish Republic. Fears surrounding the animals transported to Co.
Roscommon from the Armagh farm have intensified.
