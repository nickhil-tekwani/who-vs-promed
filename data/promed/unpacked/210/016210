The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare said that ground squirrels south of Kuna in the Morley Nelson Birds of Prey Conservation Area have tested positive for plague and that humans and pets should avoid the area. The bacterial disease responsible for the deaths of an estimated 50 million people in the 14th century, or nearly 60 percent of Europe, was found by Idaho Fish and Game officials, testing positive in 7 dead squirrels sent to the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials said they found 24 die-off sites. Ground squirrels are routinely tested, as plague has appeared in ground squirrel populations before.

The plague area of approximately circular shape extends just south of Kuna to the Snake River, bordering Interstate I-84 to the north and nearly to Mountain Home eastward.

Clinical signs of plague in humans include headache, weakness, fever and chills. 2 cases of plague in Idaho among humans happened in 1991 and 1992. Both recovered.

Dogs or cats with clinical signs of fever, vomiting or loss of appetite should see a veterinarian immediately. Protect pets with flea repellent products and do not allow them to roam free. Rolling in or picking up a dead squirrel by dogs should not be permitted.

Plague has not been detected in any other animals at this time.

[Plague is primarily a disease of wild rodents. It is caused by the bacterium _Yersinia pestis_, which is mainly spread by the bites of infectious fleas. The bacterium is not native to North America. When it was introduced, it became established in some rodent populations. Some species are particularly susceptible. For example, _Y. pestis_ caused the extinction of entire colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs. Small rodents such as deer mice and grasshopper mice are suggested to act as the reservoirs. Larger species like squirrels and chipmunks are considered to be more vulnerable to infection.

A map of the affected area can be accessed at http://healthmap.org/r/awKj. - Mod.PMB]

[Plague, caused by _Yersinia pestis_, is enzootic among rodents in the western USA. Humans can be infected through 1) the bite of an infected flea carried by a rodent or, rarely, other animals; 2) direct contact with contaminated tissues; or 3) in rare cases, inhalation of respiratory secretions from infected people or animals.

Plague is a potential bioterrorism agent. Human infections are rare but can be life-threatening. The plague case-fatality rate depends on the clinical presentation (that is, bubonic, septicemic, or pneumonic) and timing of initiation of antibiotic therapy; if untreated, the case-fatality rate is over 50 per cent for bubonic plague and approaches 100 per cent for pneumonic plague. Rapid laboratory identification can help guide therapy.

Domestic cats and dogs can also contract plague from infective fleas. They may carry infected fleas home to their owners. Cats may serve as a direct source of infection. There are many flea treatments and repellents appropriate for pets available. Some products may be suitable for dogs but not cats, or may be suitable for an adult but not a younger animal. Be sure to consult your veterinarian, as some products may be toxic to cats, kittens, and puppies, even resulting in fatalities.

Clinical signs in pets involve a localized swelling, such as under the jaw in cats, but also in the inguinal region or under the front leg (the armpit if you will), lethargy, anorexia, and fever. Please take your pet to a veterinarian if you notice any abnormalities.

Veterinarians should protect themselves by wearing gloves when examining these swellings. A bubo that ruptures may infect the veterinarian or even the pet owner if the pet owner is the one palpating the swelling.

Another form of the disease is the respiratory form. Cats may acquire this form and can spread it to their owners or the veterinarians through infected expiratory droplets. People are also prone to the respiratory infection.

You should also be aware that the fleas that hitchhike into your home via a pet vehicle can also transmit disease to you, the owner, or caretaker of the pet. Sleeping in the same bed with dogs has been associated with plague in enzootic areas. Plague patients with no history of exposure to rodents can be infected by _Y. pestis_ if their pets carry infected rodent fleas into the home. Veterinarians always should recommend flea control to dog and cat owners.
