Oman reports 1st [MERS] death
Saudi Arabia announces new death, bringing its toll to 53
---------------------------------------------------------
The 1st known case of [MERS] coronavirus in Oman succumbed to the deadly virus on [Saturday] morning [9 Nov 2013] after battling the illness for 12 days.

The 68-year-old Omani from the country's northwest region was first diagnosed with [MERS] on [29 Oct 2013] at the Adam health centre, about 200 km [124 mi] northwest of Muscat, but he was moved to the Nizwa Hospital as he had a persistent fever, where he tested positive for the virus.

According to a press release issued by the Ministry of Health, the patient was suffering from multiple chronic diseases, including diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease.

"He was under the best medical care but his condition kept deteriorating and on Saturday morning [9 Nov 2013] he breathed his last due to lung failure," a spokesman for the ministry said.

During a recent interaction with media Dr Ahmad Bin Mohammad Al Saeedi, Oman's Minister of Health, had said: "We have examined 129 cases over the last year and all tested negative for this virus. We have a strong surveillance system which has also been appreciated by the WHO."

Symptoms of [MERS] infection include renal failure and severe acute pneumonia, which often result in a fatal outcome. The 1st patient had a "7-day history of fever, cough, expectoration and shortness of breath". MERS has an estimated incubation period of 12 days.

Meanwhile, Saudi health authorities announced on Sunday [10 Nov 2013] a new death caused by [MERS], bringing to 53 the number of fatalities in the kingdom from the coronavirus.

The health ministry gave no details on the latest death in the country most affected by the disease that first appeared in the Gulf state in September 2012.

The virus has so far cost 64 lives worldwide, according to a [4 Nov 2013] update by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Experts are struggling to understand [MERS], for which there is no vaccine.

It is considered a deadlier but less-transmissible cousin of the [SARS] virus that erupted in Asia in 2003 and infected 8273 people, 9 per cent of whom died.

Like [SARS], [MERS] appears to cause a lung infection, with patients suffering from [fever], cough, and breathing difficulty.

But it differs in that it also causes rapid kidney failure and the extremely high death rate has caused serious concern.

In August [2013], researchers pointed to Arabian camels as possible hosts of the virus.

[The report on the fatal case in an Omani citizen refers to the case reported in ProMED-mail post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (78): Saudi Arabia, Oman, WHO, RFI 20131101.2032982.

The media report above also mentions a report of a fatality in Saudi Arabia having been announced over the weekend (10 Nov 2013). No further information on this fatality is given, nor are there any details of another fatality in Saudi Arabia on the Saudi MOH website as of the time of writing this report. ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate receiving clarification of this report from knowledgeable sources.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update, 10 Nov 2013
----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHO has been informed of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Qatar.

The patient is a 48-year-old man with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on [25 Oct 2013] and was admitted to a hospital on [31 Oct 2013]. He is currently in a critical condition. Preliminary investigations reveal that he frequently visited animal barns. The patient did not recently travel and has had no contact with a previously laboratory-confirmed case with MERS-CoV.

Globally, from September 2012 to date [10 Nov 2013], WHO has been informed of a total of 151 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 64 deaths.

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Health care providers are advised to maintain vigilance. Recent travellers returning from the Middle East who develop SARI should be tested for MERS-CoV as advised in the current surveillance recommendations.

Patients diagnosed and reported to date have had respiratory disease as their primary illness. Diarrhoea is commonly reported among the patients and severe complications include renal failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with shock. It is possible that severely immunocompromised patients can present with atypical signs and symptoms.

Health care facilities are reminded of the importance of systematic implementation of infection prevention and control (IPC). Health care facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus to other patients, health care workers and visitors.

All Member States are reminded to promptly assess and notify WHO of any new case of infection with MERS-CoV, along with information about potential exposures that may have resulted in infection and a description of the clinical course. Investigation into the source of exposure should promptly be initiated to identify the mode of exposure, so that further transmission of the virus can be prevented.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions.

WHO has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to advise the Director-General on the status of the current situation. The Emergency Committee, which comprises international experts from all WHO Regions, unanimously advised that, with the information now available, and using a risk-assessment approach, the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not at present been met.
