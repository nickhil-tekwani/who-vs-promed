Disease leads to hospitalization of 8 more in Maua
---------------------
The State Secretary of Health, Luiz Roberto Barradas Barata, said that the
cases could be due to hantavirus [infection].
Another 8 persons were hospitalized in the Nardini Hospital in Maua, after
having presented with the same symptoms as the mysterious disease that led
to the death of 3 persons in the city since Thu 17 Jun 2004. With these
additional hospital admissions, 9 individuals are now under observation
with the same clinical picture. Secretary Barata already spoke of the
possibility of hantavirus [infection as the etiology].
All of the persons presently hospitalized live in the region of Primavera
Garden, where the 3 prior deaths [a husband, wife, and sister-in-law] died
on early Thursday morning and Saturday night. They had headache and fever,
body and abdominal pains, spots on the skin [rash], and acute hemorrhage.
The hospitalized cases have been subjected to a battery of tests (blood,
urine, and chest xray) in Nardini Hospital in order to identify the
disease. According to the Secretary of Health of the Municipality, these
patients presented with stable clinical pictures. In addition, the 4th case
[the 23-year-old female mentioned in the 2nd newswire below] is improving.

4th person with mystery disease in Maua
-------------------------
Another person was hospitalized, suspected of having contracted the same
disease which led to the death of 3 members of the same family in the city
of Maua. Health authorities in the municipality are awaiting results of
exams to know what disease is responsible for these deaths.
According to the Secretary of Health of Maua, Vilma Maria dos Santos, none
of the proposed hypotheses have been discarded, including hantavirus
[infection], a serious viral infection [contracted from] rodent
droppings. All of the cases presented with symptoms of headache, fever,
body and abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, light-headedness (giddiness),
spots on the skin (rash) and acute hemorrhages -- similar to those seen
with hantavirus [these are also symptoms of dengue hemorrhagic fever,
Brazilian hemorrhagic fever, and leptospirosis, to mention a few other
possible diseases. - Mod.MPP].
This 4th case, a 23-year-old, was admitted on Sat. [19 Jun 2004] to the
Nardini Hospital in the city. She lives in Guapituba Garden, which is next
to Primavera Garden, the neighborhood where the first 3 fatal cases lived.

[More information on this apparent cluster of deaths would be
appreciated. It is tempting to consider hantavirus infection as the most
likely differential diagnosis in the wake of the early cluster in Brasilia,
suggesting that the hantavirus season is beginning in Brazil. While the
predominant presentation of clinical illness caused by hantavirus infection
in the new world involves significant respiratory symptoms, it is possible
these have been omitted from the newswire while other manifestations were
more evident. Obviously, we await more information from knowledgeable
sources on results of epidemiologic and laboratory investigations. - Mod.MPP]
