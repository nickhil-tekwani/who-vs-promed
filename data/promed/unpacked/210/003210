A suspected African Swine Fever [ASF] outbreak has been reported in Rubanda district. The disease has been reported in Nyamweru, Hamurwa and Bubaare sub-counties.

According to Joanita Kobugabe, Rubanda District Information Officer, about 53 pigs have died in Igomanda parish, Nyamwweru Sub County last weekend.

Cosma Twesigwome, Rubanda District Agriculture Officer says that many pigs in the affected sub-counties have been observed with ASF-like symptoms. Twesigwome says that some of the symptoms include: high fever, depression and loss of appetite, reddening of the skin, particularly ears and snout, vomiting and diarrhoea.

She also added that samples from the carcasses and infected pigs have been sent to the animal laboratory Centre in Mbarara branch for investigations and that they have also resolved to impose quarantine against the sale, consumption and movement of pigs.

African swine fever is a highly contagious viral disease characterized by fever, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and exhaustion in pigs. The disease is highly infectious; infected pigs must be slaughtered and their carcasses buried or incinerated. The disease was last month reported in Ibanda district but was later contained.

[ASF is endemic in Uganda; outbreaks regularly occur in its neighbors as well.

According to OIE's data, a total of 3 ASF outbreaks were recorded by Uganda for the year 2018, involving 1534 susceptible pigs, of which 46 were clinically affected; 36 of them died. Stamping out is not applied; this is not surprising, given the endemic nature of the disease.

Rubanda is a district in the Western Region of Uganda; until 2016, it was a county within the neighboring Kabale District (map at https://tinyurl.com/yxms8hag). - Mod.AS
