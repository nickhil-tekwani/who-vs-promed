Wild ducks carrying bird flu virus registered in Siberia
--------------------------------------------------
Wild ducks that had been infected with bird flu, but recovered from
it, were registered in the Altai territory, the Tomsk region, Buryatia
and the Ust-Ordyn Buryat autonomous district, a regional department
of the Russian agriculture watchdog told Itar-Tass on Tuesday [19 Jun 2007].
"These birds either had contact with infected birds or carried the
virus themselves to recover," the source said. "47 probes exposed
genetic material of the virus and presence of antibodies in blood
serum."
Measures are being taken throughout Siberia to prevent a bird flu
outbreak. As of 19 Jun 2007, no bird flu cases of poultry have been
registered so far," the source said.
Around 6 million poultry are located in high-risk zones of the
Siberian federal district. Around 4.4 million of them have already
been vaccinated.

[Details on the clinical and pathological observations, respective
numbers of tested and positive wild ducks, lab results and
particularly the strain detected, will be helpful.
Russia's last follow-up report to the OIE was sent on 19 Mar 2007;
all the outbreaks ocurred in poultry in European Russia. For their
