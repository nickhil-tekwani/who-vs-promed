Due to unavailability of life-saving drugs, 7 children have died of diphtheria during the last few weeks at the Children's Hospital [Lahore, Punjab province].

Many other children are at grave risk. "Reports of diphtheria cases are reaching the health secretariat from some other parts of the province (Punjab)," a senior official told Dawn. He said that, being an acute toxin-mediated disease, diphtheria has a terribly high mortality ratio. Provision of the drug diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) from Russia, the only country which has been producing and supplying the medicine to the international market, is lacking, he said. The official said the order was placed to purchase the drug in September [2015]. "It is a matter of grave concern that the same could not be supplied so far."

Children's Hospital Medical Director Dr Ehsan Waheed Rathore confirmed diphtheria-related deaths at his hospital, saying more children were arriving from all over the province, as the "peak season" of this fatal disease had started. He said that an 11-year-old girl died on [Fri 4 Dec 2015]. She was put on a ventilator for intensive care due to complications but could not survive.

He said diphtheria, which had almost been eliminated in most parts of the world, was thriving in a few countries, including Pakistan. He said the Children's Hospital alone had received 26 children with severe complications since the winter season started in October [2015].

"The health department provided on [Fri 4 Dec 2015], 40 vials of the drug to avert any further tragedy," Dr Rathore said, adding that all the 26 children besides the 7 who succumbed to the disease had been confirmed as patients of diphtheria in the clinical investigations.

Punjab Health Director General Dr Amjad Shahzad said that although the deaths took place in recent weeks, the process to officially declare them diphtheria-related deaths was underway. He said the purchase order for the provision of the life saving [DAT] was placed on [22 Sep 2015] in view of the season of the disease. He said that, unfortunately, the medicine could not be procured due to certain reasons. For instance, he said, the finance department had refused to process the procurement for the diphtheria drug for this season when the EPI [Expanded Program on Immunization] officials failed to produce the record of consumption of the same medicine that was procured last year (2014). "Last year (2014), 2000 vials were purchased, but only 26 diphtheria cases were reported," he said. He said the EPI officials were supposed to dispose of the unused drug due to short expiry. As the process of constituting a committee to dispose of the previous expired drug was delayed, the finance department raised an objection to the new one in the absence of the details of previous consumption. "We had hardly managed 100 vials on an emergency basis from the World Health Organization when the diphtheria-related deaths emerged," said Dr Amjad.

[Certainly, the lack of diphtheria anti-toxin is an issue here for the treatment of individuals who have developed diphtheria. Primary protection against deaths from this toxin-mediated disease is, however, vaccination with toxoid to prevent the disease itself.

Most complications of diphtheria, including death, are attributable to effects of the toxin. The severity of the disease and complications are generally related to the extent of local disease. The toxin, when absorbed, affects organs and tissues distant from the site of invasion. The most frequent complications of diphtheria are myocarditis and neuritis. Myocarditis may present as abnormal cardiac rhythms and can occur early in the course of the illness or weeks later, and can lead to heart failure. If myocarditis occurs early, it is often fatal. Neuritis most often affects motor nerves and usually resolves completely. Paralysis of the soft palate is most frequent during the 3rd week of illness. Paralysis of eye muscles, limbs, and diaphragm can occur after the 5th week. Secondary pneumonia and respiratory failure may result from diaphragmatic paralysis. Other complications include otitis media and respiratory insufficiency due to airway obstruction, especially in infants. - Mod.LL]
