Rwanda: 'foot-and-mouth' disease reported in Nyagatare
------------------------------------------------------
Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], a highly contagious disease has been
reported in Nyagatare district of the Eastern Province.

Officials from the Rwanda Animal Resources Development Authority
(RARDA) said that the fatal viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals
such as cattle was confirmed present about 2 weeks ago.

Dr Theogene Rutagwenda, the director general of RARDA said that about
244 cows have been diagnosed with signs of the disease. "These are
all within Katabagemu sector (umurenge), whose cattle are now under
quarantine," he revealed.

"As we continue to investigate where the disease might have come
from, the situation is not alarming. In fact, we have managed to
contain it with no severe developments seen," Dr Rutagwenda told The
Business Times.

He said that veterinary officers in the districts have vaccinated
about 78 268 cows in the surrounding areas.

According to experts, FMD is a highly variable and transmissible
virus, which can be spread even by animals that are not vulnerable to it.

Nyagatare, the former Umutara Province, borders Uganda in the North
and Tanzania in the East.

The country's largest district has the biggest amount of cattle in
Rwanda. It is said to accommodate over 60 percent of the country's
cattle population. The disease has all along been a threat to the
district due to the high population of cattle kept on a free range
farming system.

In 2006, the [threat of the disease] forced district authorities to
pass by laws on foot-and-mouth disease as one of the strategies to
prevent further effects in the area.

The government considers transformation of the agriculture sector
from subsistence to commercial as key to improving the lives of the
local population.

Initiatives such as One-Cow-Per-Family and artificial insemination
are established to boost milk production

FMD), Pirbright, the FMD serotypes identified so far in Rwanda are O
and SAT2. Rwanda's cattle population is estimated at 1.16 million, in
about 375 000 establishments.

An official confirmation of the reported outbreak, and details on the
FMD virus serotype involved and the vaccine strains applied, are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
