Russia (Samarskaya Oblast): HFRS Cases in Tolyatti Reaches 48
--------------------------------------------------
3 more cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) have
been registered in Tolyatti during the past 7 days. According to
physicians, people admitted to the hospital state that their illness
usually developed at the beginning of the week, immediately after a
weekend spent in a dacha [a country cottage].
In total there are now 48 reported cases of HFRS in the town of
Tolyatti. According to head of the State Epidemiological Surveillance
Center in Tolyatti, Vladimir Drobishev, the most dangerous time for
HFRS is November. There have already been 27 cases of HFRS during
November, and the month is not over yet. The main reservoirs of the
disease are field-voles and forest mice.

[In a previous post, Professor Henttonen made the following comment,
equally relevant here: "Nearby regions (including Samara, south of
Ulyanovsk) are well-known for the high number of Puumala hantavirus
infections, spread by the bank vole (_Clethrionomys glareolus_) and
consequent human epidemics. Thousands of people have become ill in
the worst years, and some of these epidemics, like the one in Samara
a couple of years ago, have also been reported in ProMED-mail [see
references below].
Nephropathia epidemica, the mild form of hemorrhagic fever with renal
syndrome (HFRS), caused by Puumala hantavirus, is only rarely fatal
(case fatality rate clearly less than 1 percent). Human infections
typically occur in late autumn or early winter, when the bank voles
often invade human dwellings. Human infection occurs as the result of
exposure to rodent feces and detritus. There is no transmission of
infection from human to human. - Mod.CP]
