Lakeway officials are reporting an increase in reports of raccoons and foxes displaying symptoms of canine distemper throughout the city.

Distemper in raccoons is usually caused by the canine distemper virus. The distemper virus is fatal and is closely related to the human measles virus. The virus is contagious and spreads easily between raccoons and dogs, and the disease leads to progressive deterioration of mental and motor skills in canines.

Dog owners may protect their pets from canine distemper and rabies by having them routinely vaccinated and by making sure dogs do not come into contact with wildlife.

Infected raccoons will appear disoriented with crusted eyes, have mucus coming from their noses, and show shortness of breath. A raccoon with distemper may also display many signs associated with the rabies virus; it is not possible to tell the difference without viral testing. Infected raccoons may become suddenly aggressive and dangerous.

Anyone who encounters an animal that is displaying signs of distemper should keep children and pets away from the animal and contact the Lakeway Police Department at 314-7590.

The 1st signs of canine distemper are in the respiratory system. The mucus membranes and respiratory tract show the 1st signs of distemper infection. If the raccoon is infected, the eyes and nose will have a lot of discharge. Eyelids may be crusted over and unable to be fully opened. The raccoon may cough, have trouble breathing, and have a fever.

During the respiratory attack, the distemper virus will attack the gastrointestinal system. The raccoon will begin to vomit, even if it is barely eating. The raccoon will have diarrhea. The loss of water from the vomiting and diarrhea will cause dehydration and weakness. The raccoon will move slowly and lose weight because of a loss of appetite as the disease progresses. During the gastrointestinal phase, the footpads of the raccoon will become thick and hard.

The distemper virus continues to the neurological system. Neurological symptoms are the most noticeable because the raccoon will often come out of hiding during this phase in the progression. The raccoon will wander aimlessly without its usual concern for concealment or protecting its young. If a raccoon is out in the open during the day, something is probably wrong with it.

Distemper will cause seizures in the raccoon, usually starting in the jaw and moving on to full body seizures. The raccoon is mentally unstable during this phase and may suddenly become aggressive without warning or provocation.

[Canine distemper virus is the pathogen most frequently causing outbreaks at the carnivore wildlife-domestic interface. As distemper and rabies affect the central nervous system, they both cause behavior disorders. In raccoons, distemper usually results in stumbling and lack of 'shyness', they can seem 'dumb' and/or 'friendly'. Rabid raccoons also might lose their fear to humans and other animals and they may become slower and are brought into stupor, but they present profuse salivation, indiscriminate biting, and odd vocalization. It is very important to make sure to keep the vaccination schemes of all dogs in the area up to date, including both rabies and distemper.
