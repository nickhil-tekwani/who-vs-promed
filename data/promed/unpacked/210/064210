On [10 May 2022], the Ohio State Racing Commission revealed that a single case of strangles had been confirmed on the backstretch of Thistledown Racing in North Randall. Three barns were placed under quarantine, and no horses were allowed on or off the grounds at that time.

The OSRC released the following update on the case to the Paulick Report on [13 May 2022]:

From over 250 swabs from the 3 quarantined barns, there was one swab that returned a suspect test for _Strep. equi_. That horse was located in the same stable as the first confirmed positive. The horse with the suspect test for _Strep. equi_ was removed from the grounds and placed into isolation on the same farm as the 1st horse.

The barn that had the horse with the suspect remains in quarantine. The other 2 barns at Thistledown have been released from quarantine.

Horses are allowed to ship into Thistledown, however, once on the grounds they are not allowed to leave until the horses who are stabled in the affected barn at Thistledown complete the 2nd swab in approximately 2 weeks.

Strangles is a highly contagious respiratory bacterial disease which is characterized by swelling in a horse's lymph nodes around the horse's head and jaws. The swollen lymph nodes will sometimes abscess, and the abscesses may rupture and drain through the skin or into the guttural pouch, which may cause additional infection and complications.

In addition to this characteristic swelling, symptoms of strangles may also include fever, lethargy, loss of appetite and nasal discharge. The lymph node swelling tends to appear several days after the 1st signs of fever.

Strangles can be passed between horses through nose-to-nose contact but also inanimate objects that are shared between horses.

Most horses recover well from strangles but young horses or those with compromised immune systems can be especially vulnerable.

[_Streptococcus equi_ (strangles)
--------------------------------
Disease name: _Streptococcus equi_ equi is also known as "Strep equi" or strangles.

Disease type: bacterial infection

Transmission: _S. equi_ is spread from horse to horse through direct contact. Horses can also contract the disease by coming into contact with contaminated surfaces. The disease is highly infectious.

Frequency: _S. equi_ is extremely common. Most horses are exposed and/or infected at a young age.

Incubation period: 3-14 days.

Carrier status: Horses who have been infected but are clinically healthy can continue to incubate and shed the bacteria. A recovered horse may be a potential source of infection for at least 6 weeks after the clinical signs of strangles have resolved. Some horses that have recovered from the disease can become long-term, periodic shedders and can cause outbreaks when introduced to new herds.

Shedding period: Horses infected with _S. equi_ are a source of infection to others and often continue to shed for up to 6 weeks post recovery.

Latency: _Streptococcus equi_ is present during the incubation period, and the horse can be a carrier without any clinical signs.

Severity: low

Clinical signs:
- fever, usually preceding other clinical signs by 24-48 hours
- abscesses in the mandibular lymph nodes (in the throatlatch and below the jaw)
- nasal discharge: often thick white and yellow mucus
- inflammation of the throat
- difficulty swallowing
- wheezing
- cough
- purpura hemorrhagica: bleeding from the capillaries, which causes red spots on the mucous membranes and swelling of the limbs and head (rare; only in cases with complications)
- swelling of the muscles (rare: only in cases with complications)

Diagnosis: Diagnosis is made through culture of nasal wash, nasal swab, or pus aspirated from abscesses or through PCR testing.

Treatment: Supportive care is the primary treatment. Use of antibiotics in infected horses is restricted to those with severe clinical signs such as respiratory difficulty, as most horses recover without antibiotic treatment. Horses treated with antibiotics early in the course of infection may avoid lymph node abscesses but may not develop immunity to the disease. Treatment decisions should be made by a veterinarian.

Prognosis: Good: Strangles is rarely fatal and horses usually make a full recovery in 3-4 weeks with few complications. Horses who have been infected with strangles can maintain long-term immunity to that bacterial strain.

Prevention: An intranasal vaccine is available but is not effective against all infections. Any surfaces that are contaminated with mucus or other nasal discharge from infected horses pose a threat of infection to healthy horses. After an outbreak, cleaning should involve removal of all organic material from surfaces and subsequent disinfection of water containers, feeders, fences, stalls, tack, and trailers.

Biosecurity: _S. equi_ outbreaks can be hard to prevent because of the prevalence of subclinical carriers (clinically healthy horses who shed the bacteria for weeks or even years after recovery). Outbreaks are common, especially in facilities with high horse traffic where new horses are frequently moved between stables or herds. Whenever possible, new horses should be quarantined for up to 3 weeks when being introduced to a new facility. High standards of hygiene should be maintained in facilities to decrease chance of horses contacting contaminated surfaces. To prevent indirect infection during an outbreak, handlers should avoid coming in contact with susceptible animals after handling infected animals. Handlers should wear protective clothing, avoid using the same equipment on multiple animals, and disinfect hands and equipment when moving between animals.
