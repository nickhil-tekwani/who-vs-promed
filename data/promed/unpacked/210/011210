The Department of Health is today [Mon 3 Apr 2006] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob disease.
This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of the disease thought to
be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Fri 31 Nar 2006:
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
-----------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 110
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 45
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 155
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 161
(The next table will be published on Mon 8 May 2006)
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 6 Mar 2006, the
total number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD has increased by one.
Consequently the overall total has increased from 154 to 155. The number of
vCJD cases still alive remains at 6, therefore the overall total number of
definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) has increased from 160 to 161.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the UK is
now in decline (see following report). The number of deaths due to definite
or probable vCJD in the UK during the 12 months of 2005 remains 5. The peak
number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in 2001, 17 in
2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, and so far 2 in 2006. - Mod.CP]
Totals for All Types of CJD Cases in the UK during 2005
-------------------------------------------------------
As of 31 Mar 2006, in the UK in the year 2005 there were 121 referrals of
suspected CJD, and there were 63 deaths from sporadic CJD, 6 from familial
CJD, 3 from iatrogenic CJD, 5 GSS (Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome
cases, and 5 deaths from vCJD. The corresponding figures so far for the
first three months of 2006 are: 22 referrals, 16 deaths from sporadic CJD,
2 from familial CJD, 2 from vCJD, 2 from GSS and none from iatrogenic CJD.

A detailed description of the 1st case of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(vCJD) in Japan, originally reported in February 2005, has just been
published [1,2]. The patient was a 51-year-old man who had spent around 24
days in the United Kingdom in 1990, during the bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak. He is known to have eaten mechanically
recovered meat during his visit, and although exposure in other European
countries he visited, including France and Japan, cannot be excluded, it is
thought that he may have been exposed to the BSE agent during his UK visit.
If exposure in the UK was the source of his infection, then the incubation
period to illness onset was 11.5 years.
It is also noted that the patient's illness duration was unusually long, at
42 months, and that periodic synchronous discharges (PSD), which have not
been reported in other vCJD cases, appeared on the patient's
electroencephalogram, 12 months before death. The working group reporting
on the case suggest that the World Health Organization vCJD case definition
[3] be revised to state that PSD does not exclude the possibility of vCJD.

The WHO definition of patients with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(vCJD) should be revised to prevent cases being missed, according to a Case
Report in the Lancet journal. Masahito Yamada and colleagues detail the 1st
Japanese case of definitive vCJD. 19 months after the onset of symptoms an
electro-encephalogram (EEG) showed no periodic synchronous discharges
(PSD). However, the brainwave pattern appeared after 30 months. There have
been no previous reports of PSD on EEG in vCJD.

[The case report cited by Mariko Toya is entitled "The 1st Japanese case of
variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease showing periodic electroencephalogram",
by Masahito Yamada on behalf of the Variant CJD Working Group,
Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Surveillance Committee, Japan. The following are
some extracts from the Case Report.
"In the 1st half of 1990, this Japanese patient had spent about 24 days in
the UK, 3 days in France, and 2 weeks in other European countries where
vCJD has not been reported. He had no history of surgery or blood
transfusion, or a family history of prion disease. Electroencephalogram
(EEG) showed diffuse slowing, but no periodic synchronous discharges (PSD).
In Dec 2001 brain MRI showed hyperintensity in the caudate, putamen,
thalamus, and cerebral cortex, with higher intensity in the caudate and
putamen than the thalamus. EEG suggested the presence of PSD. The diagnosis
of probable sporadic CJD was supported by EEG and MRI findings. He died of
pneumonia in Dec 2004. Autopsy showed findings characteristic of vCJD,
including florid plaques and the Parchi type 2B or Collinge type 4 pattern
of protease-resistant PrP.
This is the 1st Japanese case of definite vCJD. The progressive
neuropsychiatric disorder was consistent with vCJD, although the illness
duration was unusually long compared with most vCJD cases reported to date
(median 14 months). The findings 19 months after onset of symptoms, showing
the pulvinar sign on MRI and the absence of PSD on EEG, together with the
clinical features, fulfilled the criteria of probable vCJD. However, 30
months after onset, PSD appeared on EEG, and the pulvinar sign on MRI
disappeared following an increase in intensity of other grey matter nuclei,
fulfilling the criteria for probable sCJD. There have been no previous
reports of PSD on EEG in vCJD, although conversion of a positive to
negative pulvinar sign on MRI has been described in a few vCJD patients.
This case shows that PSD does not exclude the possibility of vCJD.
The authors suggest revision of the WHO vCJD case definition 3 to prevent
missing cases of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

Everyone could be susceptible to vCJD infection via blood transfusions but
their genes could determine how it will affect them, a study suggests. So
far, all cases of vCJD in humans have been in people with one particular
genetic profile. But mouse tests by the National CJD Surveillance Unit and
Institute for Animal Health scientists suggest those with other gene types
are at risk.
The Lancet Neurology journal said incubation periods could be longer for
some. To date, 161 cases of vCJD have been reported in the UK, 18 in France
and 12 in the rest of the world -- most of those of UK origin. At present,
it is not clear how susceptible people might be to transmission of vCJD
through routes such as blood transfusions. As there is currently no test
for the disease, this could mean that someone receives blood or blood
products from someone who is carrying vCJD but does not know it.
The researchers focused on differences in a gene which makes the normal
version of the rogue "prion" protein involved in vCJD. The gene encodes for
2 different types of amino acid -- methionine (M) or valine (V). Amino
acids are the building blocks of proteins. Everyone has 2 copies (alleles)
of the gene, so they can be MM, MV or VV. Virtually all those who have
developed vCJD so far have had the MM genotype, carried by around 40
percent of the population. There has only been one exception -- an MV
patient developed the disease following a blood transfusion. Around 50
percent of the population are MV, while the rest carry the VV genotype.
The researchers altered mice to have one of the 3 human genotypes, or a
bovine form, before injecting them with brain material from cases with vCJD
or the related cattle disease BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy).
Post-mortem brain tissue tests were used to see if there were signs of BSE
or vCJD.
BSE was transmitted to mice with bovine genes, but not to those with human
ones, which the researchers say shows there is a significant "species
barrier" which could explain why relatively few people have been infected
and developed vCJD.
However, vCJD was successfully transmitted to mice with all three human
genotypes, but behaved differently in each. Transmission occurred least
easily in the 16 VV mice compared to the 16 with the MV gene pattern and
the 17 with MM. However, most of the MV animals did not develop clinical
signs of vCJD during their short lifetime compared to those with MM, most
of whom did. Only one mouse with VV showed signs it had contracted the
disease, though it had no clinical symptoms.
Writing in Lancet Neurology, the researchers led by Jean Manson at the
Institute for Animal Health, said: "Our findings raise concerns relevant to
the possibility of secondary transmission of vCJD through blood
transfusion, blood products or contaminated surgical instruments." They
added: "For human-to-human vCJD infection it should be assumed that all
genotype individuals -- not just MM -- can be infected, that long
incubation times can occur, and that a significant level of subclinical
[symptom-free] disease might be present in the population."
In an editorial in the journal, Dr Corinne Lasmezas, of the Department of
Infectology at Scripps Research Institute in Florida, agreed with the
researchers' conclusions. She added: "Some MV individuals, and a very small
number of VV individuals, could become asymptomatic carriers. "In this
regard, it is unfortunate that only 10 percent of the population carries 2
V alleles, reducing the impact of this partly reassuring finding."
