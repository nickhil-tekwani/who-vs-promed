Lemon juice (and presumably citric acid) can be used to dissolve heroin and
avoid the need to heat it. Part of any infectious disease problem may
result from not heating the heroin and water, allowing microorganisms to be
injected. Lemon juice or citric solutions are excellent media for growing
_Candida_ fungus. Use of lemon juice was more common in Europe and this
practice has been associated with severe fungal infection (_Candida_
endophthalmitis) in the eye (leading to impairment of vision), cutaneous
abscesses, scalp abscesses, endocarditis, costochondritis, and widely
disseminated infection. Use of lemon juice or citric acid solutions should
be discouraged.
Another problem which might explain the symptoms (remote rank speculation)
is wound botulism, which occurs when the drug user injects into muscle
rather than vein. Local reaction to the injection leaves an ischaemic locus
allowing anaerobes to grow (tetanus [_Clostridium tetani and _C.
botulinum_). Symptoms are usually due to muscle paralysis, and this might
explain the breathing failure.

"Impure" heroin toll rises
-----------------------------
Injections into muscles are a factor in the deaths. Another drug addict in
Glasgow has died from an illness believed to have been caused by a batch of
impure heroin. It brings to nine the number of deaths in the past
fortnight. Eight of the dead were women.
Eleven more users are known to be affected by the illness, the source of
which is being investigated by a special Strathclyde Police unit. Grampian
Health Board and police have re-examined a recent drugs-related death in
their area and say there may be similarities with the Glasgow deaths.
Strathclyde chief constable, John Orr, said claims that heroin had been
contaminated were being investigated. "I think there has been an apparent
relationship between some of these deaths and certain activities. It's a
matter for investigation. I have set up a special unit to look at this and
we will investigate vigorously every one of these deaths. If someone has
supplied such drugs and we can prove it enough to satisfy a criminal court,
then that person will be arrested, it's as simple as that."
Brian Cowan, a consultant at the Victoria Infirmary, said the hospital was
seeing a number of cases, many of them young women. "Some of them go on to
develop a fatal, what looks like a septicaemic illness," he said. A number
suffered multiple organ failure and ended up in intensive care. Despite all
the therapy, a large number of them are dying and that's very unusual."
The illness is potentially so serious that Glasgow-based drugs worker
Andrew Horne has advised some heroin users to smoke and not inject the
substance, until the cause is confirmed.
The first 13 addicts to be hit by the illnesses were service users of Mr
Horne's organisation, Turning Point Scotland. He said: "We don't really
know why woman are affected, but it is possibly because women are more
prone to skin popping (injecting) when they inject straight into the
muscle. Our advice to heroin users is that if you are skin popping or
finding it difficult to find a vein then switch to smoking in the interim
until the health board has completed its investigation." Despite the fact
the cause has not been traced, Mr Horne said he believed it was a "one-off
problem". In his 17 years working in the drugs services in London, Dublin
and Glasgow he had never seen anything like the "current catastrophe".

Fourteen of the 19 addicts affected by the illness over the past two weeks
are women in their 20s and 30s. The early cases were identified in the
Govanhill area in the south of Glasgow. However other cases have now come
to light north of the River Clyde. Health officials, who have warned there
could be further casualties, said those affected had a serious abscess as a
result of injecting into muscle or accidentally injecting outside a vein.
The most likely explanation is contamination of either the drugs injected
or the citric acid used to dissolve the heroin before it is injected, the
officials added. However tests on one batch of citric acid have proved
negative and it is thought the problem is more likely to be the heroin itself.
There is no evidence that the illness is spread from person to person and
the wider community is not at risk.

[This morning I spoke with Dr. Ahmed, Greater Glasgow Health Board, who
generously provided some extra details. If my notes are correct ... 8/9
dead are women. Some 17 - 18 drug addicts presented themselves when the
news was broadcast but only 9 were seriously affected; the rest were more
fussed than affected. In general the cases cluster (see above for Govanhill
and north of the Clyde). The problem is that the heroin addicts will not
commit themselves to hospital even when promised adequate methadone and
thus have progressed seriously when seen again. They tend to not respond to
antibiotics and present an overwhelming systemic clinical picture. Their
white cell counts have ranged from 50 to 150,000; normal infections would
show 10 or so. Also a high urea in absence of other liver function
abnormalities. At autopsy there is tissue oedema and necrosis;
bacteriologic recoveries have been of commensals and not explanatory of the
severe condition seen.
Heroin has been sent to Guys Hospital for further toxin & microbiological
testing; they have had problems acquiring adequate numbers of heroin
samples. Sera from nine cases have been sent to DERA, Porton Down, to test
for the presence of PA antigen. There was no evidence of fungal infection
at this time. They are currently re-examining samples for anaerobic
infections. At this time citric acid has been ruled out as a contributor.
All deaths are being autopsied.
In Glasgow it is not unusual to have 1-2 addict deaths per week. What
triggered the realisation of this outbreak was when one hospital had three
dead addicts and then called around to see if anyone else was having a
similar experience. Cumulatively they were.
He has been in touch with his counterparts in Oslo.
I am very grateful to Dr Ahmed contacting me when he is clearly so very
busy. I hope I have recorded his comments correctly. They are clearly as on
top of the situation as anyone could be while still awaiting a diagnosis. -
