The H5N1 strain of bird flu has been reported in more localities
across Viet Nam, raising fears of a possible epidemic, official and
media reports said Friday [6 Feb 2009]. The latest outbreak occurred
on a farm in Mekong delta's Ca Mau province, where 300 unvaccinated
ducklings died of the virus, said the national animal health department.

The Hanoi-based office in its earlier reports said avian influenza
had been found in ducks in nearby Soc Trang province and Nghe An
province in the country's central region. The state-run Thanh Nien
newspaper said Friday [6 Feb 2009] that southern Bac Lieu has been
added to the list of bird-flu hit provinces.

"Epidemics could spread easily because of cold weather and local
residents' habit of letting the ducks run around in rice fields,"
Thanh Nien said, adding that thousands of infected poultry have died
or been culled this year [2009].

Earlier this month [February 2009], Viet Nam's capital Hanoi issued a
ban on the widespread use of motorbikes or bicycles to transport
poultry and livestock for fear it could help trigger an epidemic.

However, state media has frequently reported that meat products
continued to be transported by motorbike into the city daily despite the ban.

The communist state, which has been hit by bird flu since 2003,
reported a human case this year [2009], an 8-year-old girl from
northern Thanh Hoa province who has now recovered.

Her 13-year-old sister died in hospital earlier but was not tested
for H5N1 before the burial, health officials said.

Viet Nam has recorded 52 human deaths of bird flu, the 2nd highest
toll after Indonesia, where the virus has killed 115 people.

[The following information is derived from the commentary by
moderators YMA/MPP in PRO/MBDS posting 20090207.0556 (Avian influenza
- MBDS region (06): Viet Nam):

At present, the provinces in Viet Nam affected by H5N1 infection in
poultry within the last 21 days are Ca Mau, Soc Trang, Nghe An and
Bac Lieu provinces. Bac Lieu is the latest province reporting an H5N1
outbreak, while this outbreak is likely to spread from the
neighboring provinces, Ca Mau and Soc Trang, which reported the H5N1
outbreak recently and are under quarantine.

In the meantime, Ca Mau province has reported new H5N1 outbreaks in 5
hamlets. The previous outbreak was on 2 Feb 2009. Current updates on
the H5N1 situation in Viet Nam are available (in Vietnamese) on the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development website at
