Massive yellow fever [YF] vaccination follows the finding of 14 dead
monkeys in the Pinalito Reserve, San Pedro. Investigation has shown
it was unlikely the monkeys died of poisoning. A specimen from one of
them has been sent to the virus institute in Pergamino; the lab
result will be known in 25-30 days. There have been no more monkeys
found dead in the last 2 days [31 Jan & 1 Feb 2008].

One monkey died in Colonia Paraiso, only 6 km from the town of San
Pedro, causing some alarm. But this may have been a captive monkey
that was sick and released by its owner, fearing it had YF.

The government has sent 10 000 doses of YF vaccine to San Pedro and
10 000 to Puerto Iguazu. YF vaccination posts have been set up at the
entrance to the international bridge linking Argentina with Brazil
near the Iguassu Falls, at the hospital in Puerto Iguazu, and in the
provincial capital, Posadas; 2000 people have been vaccinated in the
last week. Vaccinators are going from house to house in Puerto
Iguazu, and tourists are being vaccinated as a precaution. All 300
people who work in the Iguazu Falls Park will be vaccinated. Previous
YF vaccination campaigns were carried out in the area in 2001, 2002
and 2003.

[Monkeys dying in the forest in South America are classic indicators
of the spread of yellow fever. When the howler monkeys fall silent,
people living in the area suspect the worst.
