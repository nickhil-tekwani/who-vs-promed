I just came across a report also posted on the Radio Netherlands website
<http://www.rnw.nl/nieuws/zijilijn.html#107311>, in Dutch) about an
outbreak on of the northern islands of the country, Texel, where the rabbit
population is being wiped out by an outbreak of myxomatosis and more
interestingly of a VHS-virus [rabbit hemorrhagic disease-virus, I assume -
Mod.PC epidemic. Would any of the veterinary health officials involved in
this double outbreak be able to shed a more detailed light on it?

[A search on Agricola reveal one instance where the two diseases were
purposefully brought together. See:
Bertagnoli,S.; Gelfi,J.; Le-Gall,-G. et al.Protection against myxomatosis
and rabbit viral hemorrhagic disease with recombinant myxoma viruses
expressing rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus capsid protein. J. Virol. Aug
1996. v. 70 (8) p.5061-5066.
More information on the outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.PC
