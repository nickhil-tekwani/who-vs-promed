Pet passports lead to surge in dogs dying from foreign diseases
---------------------------------------------------------------
A growing number of British pets are catching deadly diseases on foreign
holidays, as more animals travel with their owners on the "pets' passports"
scheme introduced 4 years ago. The School of Tropical Medicine in Liverpool
said that reported cases of some animal diseases picked up on holiday had
doubled since 2002.

During 2003, 37 pet dogs -- almost half of the 84 tested at the school --
were found to have leishmaniasis, an incurable disease passed on by
sandflies in Mediterranean countries. The figure is more than double the 17
dogs that caught the disease on holidays in 2002. Symptoms include weight
loss, eye disease, and kidney failure. Other diseases that have shown
increases of about 100 percent include babesiosis and ehrlichiosis -- blood
diseases spread by ticks -- and heartworm, a parasite passed on by mosquitoes.

[The newspaper report then includes an account of a juvenile West Highland
Terrier that died of babesiosis after holidaying with his owners in SW France.]

Vets estimate that about 300 dogs nationally were known to have caught
diseases abroad during 2003. They fear that many more cases go undiagnosed
or unreported. As millions of Britons prepare to fly abroad for their
summer holidays, Dr Jackie Barber -- a veterinary parasitologist -- warned
pet owners that they should be aware of the risks. "It is heartbreaking for
owners when their pets catch these diseases and, in many cases, die. People
must realise that it is a very real threat." Babesiosis, which has claimed
the lives of at least 2 dogs since the Easter holidays, can kill pets
within days, while other diseases have incubation periods of months or years.

Dr Susan Shaw, a senior lecturer in veterinary science at Bristol
university, said: "Animals have no immunity to the infections and there are
no vaccinations. It is crucial that pet owners use preventative measures
such as repellents to stop the insects biting and spreading the disease."

The situation is made worse by the fact that many British vets are
unfamiliar with the diseases. Most vets refer the pets to tropical medicine
schools, sending blood samples for analysis. Doctors fear that the diseases
could be passed on to other animals back in Britain -- and possibly to
humans, although there is no evidence that this has happened. Most of the
exotic diseases are picked up on beaches and in woods and gardens in
Mediterranean countries including France, Spain, Italy and Greece.

Dr Barber said: "We don't associate Europe with tropical diseases in
humans, but for animals it is as if they were travelling to somewhere like
Africa." The School of Tropical Medicine, which mainly treats human
diseases but works closely with Liverpool University's veterinary
department, has set up a diagnostic scheme, Testapet, to help vets to
detect the exotic diseases.

The Government's passport for pets scheme was set up in 2000 to allow
animals to travel to Europe when their owners went on holiday. The scheme
has been extended to cover North America, and up to 150 000 pets are
expected to travel abroad in 2004. A spokesman for the British Small
Animals Veterinary Association said: "It is vital that pets be checked as
soon as they come back to Britain if they show any signs of sickness."
British dogs are particularly susceptible to babesiosis because, having
never encountered the disease, they have no resistance to it and can die
within days of the symptoms appearing.

I was slightly bemused by the comments in this article regarding veterinary
surgeons sending most samples to "Tropical Health schools". The laboratory
which is mentioned in the article is based in such a place, although run
via University of Liverpool Veterinary School. Most veterinary surgeons are
referring samples for companion animal exotic diseases to commercial
private veterinary laboratories, to labs at veterinary schools, and to the
Veterinary Laboratories Agency (Government agency doing export testing for
dogs and cats). They need advice on treatment and management of these
diseases as well.

We have had a dedicated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) diagnostic service
for multiple pathogens of companion animals "exotic" to the UK based at the
University of Bristol Veterinary School for the past 4 years. The current
sample submissions to our lab alone are more 10 times those mentioned for
the lab in the article. We do pass on _Leishmania_ serology where necessary
to the laboratory mentioned in the article.

There is no doubt that the number of dogs traveling into the UK with exotic
infectious diseases is increasing rapidly. Those of us with experience in
the area are not surprised, as there was minimal interest in prevention of
diseases other than rabies and _E. multilocularis_ from the government. In
addition, companion animal travel was actively encouraged with a public
relations campaign by DEFRA (Department of Environment Food and Rural
Affairs) for the first few years until the backlash of animals dying after
return occurred.

However, many veterinary practices are still not aware of the risks of
serious canine diseases and are not advising routine preventative measures
for animals travelling into endemic areas. UK dogs are immunologically
naive, and sudden exposure to _Babesia_, in particular, has resulted in
peracute disease far more serious clinically than is seen in France where
most of them contract infection.

DEFRA have now set up a voluntary recording scheme for exotic disease cases
in travelling small animals and will be releasing an analysis of the first
years results very soon. I have seen these results, and although they
represent only a proportion of animals actually contracting disease, the
trend seen is the same as in our lab.

[Following Susan's advice, I navigated the DEFRA website and came upon this
6 month report (March-August 2003) on illnesses in companion animals that
had traveled on the continent or had been living there. - Mod.MHJ]

DACTARI - 6 month report
------------------------
This report updates information which was provided in a letter to the
Veterinary Record 16 Aug 2003 Volume 153, Number 7. The first 6 months...

On 1 Mar 2003 Defra launched DACTARI (Dog and Cat Travel and Risk
Information). This scheme was to find out about the occurrence of exotic
diseases in dogs and cats in Great Britain. DACTARI is a national voluntary
reporting scheme for the investigation of the possible occurrence of exotic
diseases of dogs and cats in England, Wales and Scotland.

In the first 6 months of the scheme [Mar through Aug 2003] 13 reports of
exotic disease in dogs were reported from England and Wales. There were
none for cats. All 12 cases were of dogs with a history of travel or
residency abroad. Of these, 9 entered (or re-entered) Great Britain through
the Pet Travel Scheme and 4 entered via quarantine.

Diagnoses reported
13 reports were received for cases which were diagnosed during 2003. One
dog was diagnosed with 2 exotic diseases, so there were a total of 14
diagnoses. Of the 14 diagnoses only 2 were based on clinical signs alone.
The remainder were confirmed on the basis of both clinical findings and
laboratory tests.

The majority (6) of the diagnoses were for leishmaniasis, with 4 confirmed
cases and 2 suspected. Others were of babesiosis (5) and ehrlichiosis (3).
[Maps showing where these cases lived in the UK are on the website. There
is no information on where the cases might have become infected.]

3 reports were received for cases which occurred prior to 2003. 2 were of
leishmaniasis and one of babesiosis; the former were reported from England,
the latter from Scotland.

[Then follows pet-health advice to owners and to veterinarians on how to
report cases.]

[This is like other reports that lack denominators; the numerators are hard
to judge without knowing either the number of animals accompanying their
owners on holidays, and for incidence density the number of dog days of
risk, for example. Also while the DACTARI effort is admirable, it is a
passive system and therefore will by its nature underreport case numbers,
with probably a bias towards the more lethal incidents, while ignoring the
minor illnesses; vide the Telegraph claim of 300 cases in 2003 and DEFRA's
reported figure of 13. The truth? Who knows? It would be helpful if some
sentinel practices were recruited to provide structured reports on all
their clients' travel experiences -- good, bad, and indifferent. Also these
sentinel animals and others would provide a good cheap resource for
archived agents and their genomic characterisation, as a baseline of such
data is always useful. If matched with a similar organisation in France,
Spain or Italy, it would be possible to compare virulences of these
pathogens in domestic and visiting animals. When the Exotic Diseases
Division, DEFRA, publishes its 12 month report, we will be glad to help
them disseminate their results. - Mod.MHJ]
