Old World screwworm finding in Massachusetts canine imported from Singapore
--------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-- 1 Nov 2007 the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) confirms
Old World screwworm infestation, _Chrysomya bezzian_, in a 9 month old
canine (Labrador retriever) located in Norwell, Massachusetts.
-- 29 Oct 2007, the canine arrived by air in Boston from Singapore via a
one-day stop in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
-- 29 Oct 2007, upon arriving in the United States the owner noticed a
wound near the base of the tail and took the dog to a private veterinary
clinic in South Weymouth, Massachusetts.
-- 29 Oct 2007, the attending private practitioner veterinarian excised and
collected the larva from the wound.
-- 30 Oct 2007 the sample was forwarded to the NVSL through the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA), APHIS area veterinarian in charge
(AVIC) Dr William G Smith, and the Massachusetts State Veterinarian, Dr
Lorraine O'Connor.
-- The screwworm larvae identified at the NVSL are not full grown (in the
2nd to early 3rd instar stage) indicating the maggots were several days
from exiting the wound as viable larva.
-- Massachusetts is a state too far north for the long term survival of
this tropical insect
-- This Old World screwworm incident in an imported canine is NOT related
to the Mississippi New World screwworm case reported in August 2007.
-- Coordinating actions, including an initial conference call and action
plan development, have occurred between state and federal animal health
officials.
-- The risk of introduction of screwworm from this particular incident is
currently identified as negligible to very low. However APHIS and
Massachusetts Animal Health Officials will take appropriate actions to
fully investigate and respond to this incident.
-- The risk of introduction of screwworm from this particular incident is
currently identified as negligible to very low. In a worst case scenario,
the risk period in which one might expect to find clinical manifestations
of screwworm strike is estimated (from the biology of the Old World
screwworm) to begin around 13 Nov 2007 and continue no later than 6 Dec
2007, with projected weather conditions.

Action plan
1. APHIS is working with state officials to locate and quarantine the dog
for further observation and treatment. The dog may be enroute to another state.
2. Passive surveillance activities:
-- Awareness among public health and veterinary practitioners in the
affected area will be accomplished via distribution of fact sheet and an
information release by various means.
-- APHIS and state animal health officials will call or visit veterinary
practitioners in Massachusetts.
-- The risk of introduction of screwworm from this particular incident is
currently identified as negligible to very low. In a worst case scenario,
the risk period in which one might expect to find clinical manifestations
of screwworm strike in additional animals is estimated (from the biology of
the Old World screwworm) to begin around November 13, 2007 and continue no
later than 6 Dec 2007, with projected weather conditions.
3. Active surveillance activities:
The current risk assessment does not support active surveillance activities.
4. Other control actions to be performed by the Massachusetts State
Veterinarian and APHIS:
-- The chronology, itinerary, and movement history of the canine will be
further investigated and documented.
-- The owner's vehicle will be inspected, cleaned, and treated with a
pesticide if determined necessary.
-- Any transport crates occupied by the dog will be inspected, cleaned, and
treated with a pesticide if determined necessary.
-- The homes and yards where the dog has been present will be inspected and
treated by a certified pest control company if determined necessary.
-- The veterinary clinic in MA will be inspected, cleaned and treated with
a pesticide if determined necessary.
5. APHIS Legislative and Public Affairs (LPA) and Massachusetts State
Officials will develop and execute a public information plan as needed,
that includes distribution of a screwworm fact sheet and a short
information release on the incident to appropriate stakeholders.
6. USDA APHIS National Center for Import and Export (NCIE) will report the
finding to OIE as appropriate. NCIE will coordinate any enhanced actions
with DHS Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
7. Veterinary Services (VS) will ask IS to notify countries where dog
originated and passed through on way to United States.

[An interesting case of an Old World screwworm coming into the United
States. It certainly indicates that surveillance is key and that diagnostic
laboratories are valuable in such surveillance.

Screwworms are fly larvae (maggots) that feed on living flesh. These
parasites can infect any mammal or bird and can enter wounds as small as a
tick bite. Left untreated, screwworm infestation can be fatal. Screwworms
have been eradicated in the United States, Mexico, and all countries in
Central America; however, they could become re­established from larvae
carried on infested animals.

New World screwworm myiasis is caused by the larvae of _Cochliomyia
hominivorax_ (Coquerel). Old World screwworm myiasis is caused by the
larvae of _Chrysomya bezziana_ (Villeneuve). These fly larvae are obligate
parasites of live animals and feed on the living tissues and fluids inside
wounds.

_C. bezziana_, the Old World screwworm, can be found in South East Asia,
Kuwait, the Indian subcontinent, the main island of Papua New Guinea,
tropical and sub­Saharan Africa, Oman, Muscat, and Fujaira. This fly has
never become established in Europe, North Africa, Australia, the Middle
East, or the Western Hemisphere.

New World screwworms are found only in the western hemisphere, primarily in
the tropical and semitropical regions of South America, but are rare above
7000 feet. These parasites were once widespread, but eradication programs
(through the release of sterile male flies) have eliminated them from the
United States, Mexico, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Curacao, and all of
Central America and most of Panama, leaving only a small zone at the border
with Colombia. The New World screwworm still exists in some countries of
South America and on some Caribbean islands. Eradication programs are
ongoing in Jamaica. In 1988, New World screwworms were detected in Libya,
but have since been eradicated.

Screwworm infestations are transmitted when a female fly lays her eggs on a
superficial wound.

Occasionally, Old World screwworms also lay their eggs on unbroken soft
skin, particularly if it has blood or mucous discharges on its surface. The
larvae hatch and burrow into the wound or into the flesh. Wounds infested
by screwworms often attract other female screwworms, and multiple
infestations are common. After feeding for 5 to 7 days, the screwworm
larvae leave the wound and fall to the ground, then burrow into the soil to
pupate. The adults that emerge feed on wound fluids and mate after 3­5
days. The lifespan of a male fly is about 14 days; 30 days is common for a
female.

Female screwworms are attracted to all warm­blooded animals. The distance a
fly will travel can range from 10­20 km in tropical environments with a
high density of animals to as far as 300 km in arid environments. Outbreaks
in non­endemic areas often occur when animals with screwworm myiasis are
introduced or when adult flies are car­ried in vehicles.

In the 1st day or 2 screwworm infestations are difficult to detect. Often,
all that can be seen is slight motion inside the wound. As the larvae feed,
the wound gradually enlarges and deepens. Infested wounds often have a
serosanguineous discharge and sometimes a distinctive odor. By the 3rd day,
the larvae may be easily found; as many as 200 vertically oriented
parasites can be packed deep inside the wound. However, screwworm larvae do
not generally crawl on the surface, and tend to burrow deeper when
disturbed. Sometimes, there may be large pockets of larvae with only small
openings in the skin. Screwworms may be particularly difficult to find
inside the nasal, anal, and vaginal openings. In dogs, the larvae often
tunnel under the skin. Larvae from other species of flies, which feed on
dead and decaying tis­sues, may also infest the wound.

The egg masses of Old World screwworms are similar but larger. The eggs
from other species of flies are usually not well organized.

The 2nd and 3rd instar larvae of screwworms resemble a wood screw. They are
cylindrical, with one pointed end and one blunt end, and have complete
rings of dark brown spines around the body. In 3rd stage larvae, dark
tracheal tubes can be found on the dorsum of the posterior end (101). Field
diagnosis, even with a microscope or magnifying glass, is difficult.

The Old World screwworm is green to bluish-black, with 2 transverse stripes
on the thorax. Adult screwworms are difficult to distinguish from other
flies. Laboratory diagnosis is by identification of the parasites under the
microscope. Serology is not used.

Before collecting or sending any samples from animals with a suspected
foreign animal disease, the proper authorities should be contacted. Samples
should only be sent under secure conditions and to authorized laboratories
to prevent the spread of the disease. Screwworms can infest humans; samples
should be collected and handled with all appropriate precautions.

Larvae should be removed from the wound with forceps before the wound is
treated. The larvae should be collected from the deepest parts of the
wound. Any eggs on the edge of the wound should be carefully removed with a
scalpel. The samples of eggs, larvae, or flies should be placed in 80 per
cent alcohol and transported to the laboratory. Formalin should not be used.

In the US, screwworm infestations should be reported to state or federal
authorities immediately upon diagnosis or suspicion of the disease.
Federal: area veterinarians in charge (AVICS)

<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/sregs/official.html>

Screwworm infestations can be successfully treated with topical larvacides
or some drugs. No vaccine is available.

Since the United States has worked diligently to eradicate the New World
screwworm which represented a significant economic loss to producers and
suffering to animals, the vigilent surveillance necessary to remain free of
this disease is critically important.

It is significant that this was an Old World screwworm and certainly
demonstrates the necessity for constant surveillance. Although the posting
from APHIS indicates that Massachusetts is too far north for this parasite
to establish it also acknowledges there is a risk. It is warmer than normal
in the north eastern US this year also the ability for the patient to
travel to another state, possibly a warmer state, indicates there is
clearly a risk here.
