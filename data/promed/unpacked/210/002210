[2] Saudi Arabia: Wadi Aldwasir camel market closed by Saudi Ministry of the Environment - media

The Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture has quickly closed the camel market in Wadi Aldwasir, the largest camel market in the Gulf, following the continued presence of human infections of the Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS].

According to a letter obtained earlier, [the Ministry of] Environment today [Thu 21 Feb 2019] directed the competent authorities in Wadi Aldwasir to quickly close the camel market after recording positive cases in camel samples taken, and [recognizing] the urgent need to reduce the sources of spread of disease and injury among camel owners and violators of labor and visitors to the market, which is the largest camel market in the Gulf.

The letter confirmed that, after positive cases in samples taken from camels [in the market] were registered, the Ministry of Agriculture tried hard to quickly shut down as a precaution until the epidemiological situation of the disease stabilizes.

The Ministry of Health announced that 23 cases infected with the coronavirus causing MERS-CoV have been cured in the province of Wadi Aldwasir, noting that since the emergence of cases, the MoH took all precautionary and preventive measures.

[To date there have been 48 reported cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection from Wadi Aldwasir. Twelve of the 48 cases (25%) had a history of contact with camels in the 2 weeks preceding testing for MERS-CoV infection. Not all of these individuals were classified as primary cases: 3 were classified as secondary cases that had contact with a previously confirmed case. Of interest was that, in addition to the 7 cases classified as primary cases with history of contact with camels, there were an additional 5 cases classified as primary cases with no history of camel contact. Thus, approximately 25% of cases reported from Wadi Aldwasir were classified as primary cases, and almost 75% of cases reported from Wadi Aldwasir were classified as secondary cases (there are still 2 recently confirmed cases pending classification).

Given the presence of continued primary cases being reported from Wadi Aldwasir, and the finding that camels being sold at the market in Wadi Aldwasir have been found to be actively infected with the MERS-CoV, it seems a prudent step to close the camel market in an attempt to interrupt transmission of MERS-CoV in the community.
