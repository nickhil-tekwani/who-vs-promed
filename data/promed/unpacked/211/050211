The ebolavirus that has killed scores of people in Guinea this year [2014] is a new strain, evidence that the disease did not spread there from outbreaks in some other African nations, scientists report.

"The source of the virus is still not known," but it was not imported from nearby countries, said Dr. Stephan Gunther of the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg, Germany. He led an international team of researchers who studied the genetics of the virus and reported results online Wednesday [16 Apr 2014] in the New England Journal of Medicine. The ongoing outbreak has caused panic and killed more than 120 people in West Africa, mostly in Guinea, according to the World Health Organization.

Earlier, health officials had said the Guinea ebolavirus was a Zaire strain, different from the kind that has caused cases in other parts of Africa. The Democratic Republic of Congo used to be called Zaire.

The new research analyzed blood samples from 20 patients in the current outbreak and found the strain was unique. "It is not coming from the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has not been imported to Guinea from that country or from Gabon, where ebolavirus disease also has occurred," Gunther said.

Researchers think the Guinea and other strains evolved in parallel from a recent ancestor virus. The Guinea outbreak likely began last December [2013] or earlier and might have been smoldering for some time unrecognized. The investigation continues to try to identify "the presumed animal source," they write.

[The original article is: Baize S. et al. Ebola Outbreak in Guinea -- Preliminary Report, NEJM, Online First, 16 Apr 2014 (DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1404505), available at: http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1404505

Abstract: "In March 2014, the World Health Organization was notified of an outbreak of a communicable disease characterized by fever, severe diarrhea, vomiting, and a high fatality rate in Guinea. Virologic investigation identified Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) as the causative agent. Full-length genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that EBOV from Guinea forms a separate clade in relationship to the known EBOV strains from the Democratic Republic of Congo and Gabon. Epidemiologic investigation linked the laboratory-confirmed cases with the presumed first fatality of the outbreak in December 2013. This study demonstrates the emergence of a new EBOV strain in Guinea." - Mod.MPP]

"There are 11 new cases of Ebola in Guekedou including 3 dead ," says prefect [mayor] Mohamed Keita.

To the national radio (RTG) the prefect of Guekedou Elhadj Keita Mohamed V, expressed his deep concern over the reluctance of local people to report cases of illness and death related to Ebola . "Hide a sick or dead [victim of] Ebola is like a bomb , and when it explodes , it can do much damage," said the prefect.

According Elhadj Keita Mohamed V , the city of Guekedou is no longer the epicenter of viral haemorrhagic fever, but it is in rural areas where the virus has currently far more victims ... "We even wanted to take steps to prosecute citizens and local authorities that hide the sick and dead", admits the prefect, who personally directs the prefectural crisis committee.

Speaking of the latter cases, Elhadj Mohamed V Keita said that these patients came from the outskirts of Guekedou. "They were 11 patients. Among these, one has tested negative and was released, 10 tested positive and there have been 3 deaths among these 10 cases ", reported the first prefectural authority; admitting anxiety and controversies that have driven these revelations, when there was a semblance of calm.

On the method used locally in case of declaration of illness or death, Keita Mohamed V explained that it is the Red Cross goes into the affected areas to transport the sick or bury the dead. If patients are sent [to hospital] and samples are taken, within 4 hours the results come from the Pasteur Institute of Dakar ... If the case is positive, he is kept in, if negative, released," said the prefect by phone to Amara Camara of national radio RTG.

According to the prefect, in total, 111 suspected cases of Ebola and 71 deaths were officially recorded in Guekedou .
More generally, the national response committee which announced daily reports of suspected cases and deaths related to Ebola , the voice of Dr. Sakoba Keita daily, changed its strategy , it is now announcing that the case of "cure" of Ebola ...

Government figures have convinced President Alpha Cond√© it is keeping secret the spread of Ebola in the country that foreign countries and airlines continue to be open to Guinea ; whereas this lack of information added to doubts among some Guineans already existed on the real existence of this virus in our country increases the risk behaviors of some of our compatriots .

According to some of our compatriots , " many investors are afraid to come now in Guinea and some foreigners have left the country on tiptoe they have information that would indicate that the chain propagation is not controlled and the Guinean government does not provide reliable information on the actual record from the ravages of Ebola . "

Senegal -- which is represented in the Guinean response to Ebola since the announcement of the existence of this virus in Guinea by a team and equipment of the Pasteur Institute of Dakar has still not reopened its land borders with our country and the weekly sub-regional markets ... the Gambia has suspended all flights to Guinea and airlines like Emirates have suspended their flights to Conakry ...

Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus began spreading in Guinea since the beginning of the year (January 2014 ), but was only officially announced by the Guinean authorities on [21 Mar 2014], 3 months after the 1st cases in the Forest Region. Very soon, this severe fever -- which has no vaccine or drug -- reached the Guinean capital. Yet many compatriots do not always believe in the real existence of this virus in Guinea, which has already led to more than 100 dead, officially ...

[West Africa is lucky that reagents to the known ebolavirus strains picked up the new one. It is a relief that Mali is in the clear so far.
But the allegations that cases in the Guekedou area of Guinea are being hidden is serious. - Mod.JW
