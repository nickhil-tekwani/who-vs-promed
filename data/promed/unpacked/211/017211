Fourteen years after being first detected in Sri Lanka, over 340 000 coconut palms have been identified as diseased and over 313 000 palms have been cut down, but the Southern Province continues to be plagued by Weligama wilt. The Coconut Research Institute (CRI) said that if growers and the community had been more cooperative, the disease could have been controlled sooner. The CRI had demarcated a buffer zone and the Government prohibited the transport of any palm species and their live parts out of that area. However, the prohibition was not strictly adhered to.

At the initial stage of infection, trees bear fruit profusely and growers hesitate to cut them down. The delay causes spread of the infection. While growers who cut down diseased trees were paid an incentive, the cost of loss of production and replacing trees is much higher. The Matara district where the disease was first detected has borne the brunt of the problem. Some growers had to destroy their plantations and plant other crops since the Plant Protection Act prohibits planting any type of palm tree in areas where the wilt has been detected.

[Weligama wilt was first identified in Matara district in the mid-2000s and has been spreading in southern and western Sri Lanka since (e.g. ProMED post 20211217.8700329). The causal pathogen was found to be a phytoplasma, likely related to other palm yellowing pathogens. Symptoms have been described as flaccidity and marginal necrosis of leaflets, as well as intense yellowing of fronds, similar to Kerala wilt of coconut in India (e.g. see ProMED post 20210819.8605925).

A range of yellowing diseases of coconut and other palms caused by phytoplasmas are known from different regions. They include members of the 16SrIV (_Candidatus_ Phytoplasma palmae; lethal yellowing, LY Americas; for more information see ProMED post 20210618.8456768) and 16SrXXII (_Ca._ P. palmicola; several lethal declines Africa, Asia). Phytoplasmas are spread by sap sucking insect vectors and via cutting or grafting wounds. Some of the palm pathogens may also affect herbaceous crops, such as banana or cassava (e.g., ProMED posts 20180207.5613931, 20170713.5168553). Herbaceous hosts may possibly serve as pathogen reservoirs for infection of palms.

Individual trees may be protected by regular trunk injections of antibiotics (e.g. tetracycline). Commercial control of the diseases mostly relies on phytosanitation, followed by replanting with resistant varieties. However, worldwide very few coconut varieties have shown real tolerance to LY diseases; the level of susceptibility varies depending on disease pressure and locality. Recent observations of breakdown of resistance in some widely used hybrids are causing great concern for coconut replanting programmes worldwide. Reasons for the breakdown are still uncertain and may include genetic variation of the host, the pathogen, or the vector.
