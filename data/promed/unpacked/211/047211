Since the beginning of January this year [2011], Capiz province has
recorded 2 fatalities due to rabid dog bites. Provincial Health
Medical Specialist Dr. Evelyn Bolido stated that these occurred in
Jamindan and Panitan. Bolido said also that the public must likewise
be vigilant regarding dog bites, especially during this summer season
[2011], when most cases of dog bite occur. She also urged the public
to immediately seek medical attention after a dog bite even if there
is only slight abrasion.

Bolido also reminded Capicenos to be responsible pet owners [because
neglected pets] could endanger the lives of others. She said that
responsible dog owners should have their pets immunised. This should
be arranged through the veterinary or agriculture office responsible
for canine anti-rabies vaccination in their area.

In Roxas City alone, about 10 000 dogs are being targeted for
vaccination by the Office of the City Veterinarian.

[Although the incidence of rabies has declined somewhat in the
Philippines in recent years, disease rates continue to be higher in
the Philippines than in neighboring countries. In 2010, the Department
of Health stated that rabies continued to be a public health problem
in the Philippines, where dogs are responsible for 90 percent of human
cases of rabies. In 2005, it was reported that the Philippines ranked
5th in Asia (after India, China, Pakistan, and Bangladesh).

The province of Capiz is adjacent to the province of Iloilo, which is
the location of the most recent case of human rabies reported to
ProMED-mail.
