More than 80 hippos have died in an anthrax outbreak in Uganda,
officials have said. The outbreak has killed 82 hippos and 9 buffalo
in the last month and a half [June-July 2010] in Queen Elizabeth
National Park.

Nicholas Kauta, the national anthrax task force spokesman, said no
humans were known to have contracted the deadly disease during the
outbreak and that tourism had been unaffected.

Anthrax spores occur naturally in soil and can remain dormant for
years. Drought, floods, or wind expose the spores and they can be
ingested when livestock graze close to the ground. Vaccines can
protect livestock from the disease, which is caused by the bacterium
_Bacillus anthracis_. Most forms of the disease are lethal.

A similar outbreak in Uganda in 2004 killed 300 hippos. At the time,
some scientists believed that the large scale of the infection was
caused by cannibalism.

Joseph Dudley, a biosecurity and agriculture analyst based in
Washington, was quoted in the New Scientist [magazine] as saying: "The
widespread mortality may be a result of the communal scavenging or
'cannibalism' of carcasses of anthrax-killed hippos by other hippos."
But other veterinarians and scientists believed the rapid spread of
anthrax was due to over-crowding in the park. Over-population leads to
fights over resources, and anthrax can be spread via battle wounds,
the scientific journal reported.

[The suggestion that this epidemic is facilitated by over-crowding has
a precedent. A similar epidemic in eastern Zambia some 15 years ago
followed upon the numbers of hippos in the affected area quadrupling.
The river through the affected national park was blocked in a number
of places by the floating carcasses of dead hippo. - Mod.MHJ]
