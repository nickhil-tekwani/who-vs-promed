Legionnaires' outbreak claims second victim in southern France
--------------------------------------------------------------
A 70 year old man became the second person to die in an outbreak of
legionnaires' disease in the southern French city of Montpellier, local
authorities said. The man died at a clinic in the city, the day after a
woman in her 80s succumbed to the disease at a nearby hospital.
Montpellier health authorities say they are aware of 22 further cases of
the disease in the city, 8 of whom are in intensive care. A further 2 cases
-- one diagnosed in Paris, the other in Italy -- are also believed to have
been contracted in Montpellier.
Legionnaires' disease is an infectious disease causing a severe form of
pneumonia. It is produced by a bacterium that colonizes in warm, stagnant
water and may be found in such places as air cooling systems, humidifiers,
and water taps.

Hot tub likely legionella source
---------------------------------
More cases of legionella make headlines in Norway. 10 women were probably
infected with the legionella bacteria after a bachelorette party (known as
a "hen night" in the United Kingdom. - Mod.SH) in Nesodden, Akershus ended
up in a bubbling hot tub a week and a half ago, newspaper Dagbladet reports.
"In the days after the party every one was knocked out. I had a high fever,
chest pains, and difficulty breathing," the bride-to-be told Dagbladet. The
women learned after visits to doctors that the site of their festive bath
had been shut down in June 2003 after 3 elderly women fell ill there.
Chief district physician Knut Erlend Hagen believes the 10 celebrants have
contracted Pontiac fever, a milder version of legionella infection. This
ailment tends to last a few days but can become dangerous if it develops
into pneumonia. Cases of legionella infection are commoner in the summer
months; 3 cases have been reported in the Trondheim and Oslo area.
