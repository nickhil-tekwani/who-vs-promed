Japan steps up battle against mad cow [disease; expands testing of
sheep, goats
-----------------------------------------------------
Japan stepped up its battle against mad cow disease Friday with
expanded plans to screen the country's sheep and goats for scrapie, a
sickness linked to the fatal, brain-wasting disease in cattle. Scrapie
poses no direct threat to people, but about one million cattle in
Britain are believed to have contracted mad cow disease after eating
feed made from the carcasses of sheep infected with scrapie. [It has
been proven that they were infected through the feed, but not that the
infecting agent was the scrapie prion. - Mod.JW

Eating beef from cattle infected with mad cow disease is thought to
trigger a fatal human variant of the illness. As an extra precaution,
the Health Ministry said it would start testing sheep and goats 12
months of age and older for the disease, though no timetable has been
set yet, spokesman Hideshi Michino said. Currently, the ministry tests
sheep and goats 18 months of age and older.

Asia's first case of mad cow disease was detected on a Japanese farm
last September [2001. A month later, the government began screening
all beef bound for human consumption, amid widespread public concern
over the meat's safety.

Agriculture Ministry spokesman Seiya Tanaka said Friday that Japanese
beef is now its safest since those sweeps began, with nearly all beef
products made before the checks now off the market.

A total of 3 cases of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, have been confirmed in Japan. There have been no new
cases so far this year [2002.

Spinal cord found in imported Polish beef
-----------------------------------------
Spinal cord has been found in 2 consignments of beef imported from
Poland into the UK. Bovine spinal cord is the part of the animal most
likely to contain BSE infectivity and is therefore classified as
specified risk material(SRM).

Beef from Poland entering the European Union (EU) must meet EU
standards, including the removal of SRM immediately after slaughter,
before the beef is
exported.

The first discovery was made on Mon 18 Mar 2002 in one forequarter out
of 268 quarters of beef being unloaded at Eastbourne. The beef was
imported from Poland. On Tue 19 Mar 2002, a second consignment of 238
beef quarters from a second meat plant in Poland being unloaded at
Eastbourne was also found to contain one quarter-carcass with spinal
cord still attached. The beef came from Bialystok, Poland.

Imports of meat from Poland are subject to EU controls, and have to
satisfy, among other requirements, EU controls on SRM, which require
that spinal cord be removed in the slaughterhouse of origin. Beef
imports to the UK from Poland, for the 12 months to 30 Nov 2001, were
47 tons, which is equivalent to 0.005% of UK beef consumption
(currently about 910 000 tons).

These finds of SRM in imported beef are the 25th and 26th instances
since 1 Jan 2001. They are the first ones to involve carcass beef from
a non-EU country.

Food Standards Agency Veterinary Director Debby Reynolds, said: "Any
find of SRM is illegal and a serious matter. There is no risk to
public health, as the affected meat has been removed from the food
chain. I am grateful that the Meat Hygiene Service took prompt action
to detain and destroy these 2 pieces of meat. The finds have also been
notified to the veterinary authorities in Poland, which have taken
swift action. Both Polish plants have had their authorization to
export beef suspended, and the Polish authorities are conducting an
urgent review of controls in those plants.

Letter of formal notice sent to France for non-compliance of Court
judgment on British beef
-------------------------
Under the EU-Treaty [Article 228(1), a Member State is obliged to
implement a judgment of the European Court of Justice. On 13 Dec 2001,
the Court declared France's refusal to end the ban on British beef and
veal as unlawful (C-1/00). Thus, France was to implement EU
legislation and to create the legal conditions to allow the resumption
of imports of British beef to France. Up to now no measure
implementing the Court judgment has been communicated to the European
Commission. The Commission has therefore sent today a letter of formal
notice to France identifying France's infringement of the Court
judgment. France is expected to submit its observations within 30
days.

Note to editors:
Since 1 Aug 1999 British beef can be exported under the so-called DBES
system (date-based export scheme) which sets strict conditions (i.e.,
only deboned meat of bovines 6-30 months of age).

The German government, aiming to recover consumer trust in meat
following the mad cow debacle, has launched a project to put a
computer chip in the ear of each animal to store production
information regarding the animals, government officials said
Wednesday. The system is being introduced on an experimental basis in
southern Bayern on cows, sheep and other animals. Information to be
stored in the chips includes each animal's birth date, where it was
born and raised, what types of meal it is being fed, and vaccination
information.

Search for BSE-type disease turns to fish farms
-------------------------------------------------
Scientists want farmed fish checked for BSE-like diseases -- a move
that could provoke strong opposition within the industry and heighten
concerns that the battle against the threat of killer diseases from
food may be going too far.

Advisers on the food standards agency believe tests should be devised
in an effort to close further possible avenues for infecting humans
with incurable conditions through their food. The scientists who want
to avoid any charge of complacency following the disastrous failures
to take seriously the threat from cattle before 1996, now wish to
eliminate any possible future threat. Work on fish is among the
priority areas they say should be considered by the agency's research
funding committee this year. There is no evidence to date that fish do
suffer anything like BSE, the cattle killer blamed also for the
poisoning through food of 109 Britons and 6 others. A total of 7 other
Britons still alive are suspected of having the human form of BSE,
variant CJD (abbreviated vCJD or CJD (new var.) in ProMED-mail).

The agency is already widening monitoring of farmed animals to include
deer, which in the US and Canada suffer from a BSE-like condition
known as chronic wasting disease. Fish, like other vertebrates, have
prion proteins, which in an abnormal form have been associated with
BSE and vCJD. The use of fish meal in feed for cattle, sheep and deer
has already been banned within the EU as a precaution against
cross-contamination on farms or in factories with infected animal
protein, a move that has sparked fierce protests among feed
manufacturers.

A ban on any mammalian meat and bone meal from farm animals being fed
to fish has been in place in Britain since 1996, cutting a theoretical
route of BSE infection on fish farms. Britain has a growing farmed
fish industry, most notably in the salmon farms of Scotland, which now
produce about 150 000 tons of fish a year and provide a large portion
of Scottish food exports.

More failures to carry out anti-BSE controls were revealed yesterday,
when the food standards agency announced that meat from 20 cows
exempted from the ban on animals over 30 months old entering the food
chain had not been tested for the disease in 2001, in breach of EU
rules.
