I hear from people with large experience in field work in the Andean
communities in Ecuador about cultural practices during funeral activities
and breeding of rodents (guinea pigs).
These persons told me that people in Andean communities used to eat guinea
pigs during funeral activities roasted or cooked with the potato soup. Women
used to prepare the food, but they were not too exposed to blood because the
animals were killed by cervical compression, and afterwards were boiled
before peeling and extraction of organs.
I think that this information makes less probable the hypothesis that [the
recent outbreak was food borne. Airborne is the most plausible form of
transmission in this outbreak, and probably most of the cases were a primary
form of pneumonic plague. But it is also probable that the index case or one
of the [early cases was infected by another mechanism (develop a bubonic
form, after a septicemic form and after a secondary pneumonic form). It is
important to know by which mechanism and to know if there are transmission
of the disease. The confirmation of a continued transmission implies the
risk of another outbreak.
If the prevalence of infected sentinels animals is unknown, case-finding
activities in animals must be implemented. These will be one of the more
useful data to propose control activities.
Other important action to be implemented is case-finding of lymphangitis or
abscess in humans in the region. It seems that lymphangitis was a commonly
complaint in the region a few years ago.
Finally, people from the region also told me that rodent (guinea pigs)
control activities would be culturally unacceptable. Vaccination will be
also unaccepted. People also say that guinea pigs fleas don't bite humans.
For these reasons it is also important to know the following information:
Is there specificity of hosts in guinea pigs fleas?,
What is the flea index in sentinels animals?, and which species?.
Are there _Xenopsylla_? (the plague vector).

It is uncommon to have both pneumonic and bubonic plague occurring at the
same time. An outbreak may begin as bubonic plague, transmitted by fleas from
non-human reservoirs. In cold places a patient may develop pneumonia, and
have the lungs invaded by _Yersinia_. This is known as secondary pneumonic
plague. Then, this patient spreads the bacteria by cough droplets, and
becomes a source of primary pneumonic plague, which is of direct
transmission. Bubonic plague is slow in spreading, contrary to what happens
in pneumonic plague, where a number of people can be infected at the same
time, by a single source, as it seems to have been the present case in
Ecuador. In the Andes of Ecuador and Peru, traditional mourning ceremonies
last several days, with relatives and friends crowding into the deceased's
house.
Only a few species of fleas become "blocked" and are considered to be good
vectors: those found in commensal _Rattus rattus_ (_Xenopsylla chaeopis_,
_X. brasiliensis_) or, in the case of South America, _Polygenis bolshi_,
among a few others. In the literature there is proof of experimental and
occasional mechanical transmission by other fleas, as _Pulex irritans_ and
_P.acari_. As to cuyes being good sentinels, it must be noted that in places
where plague outbreaks occur periodically, cuyes are notably resistant to
plague, and there is no cuye high mortality before the first human cases are
diagnosed.

[While guinea pigs may normally be resistant to plague, as claimed by
Fernando, a notable "die-off" was seen at or before the time of these human
cases. Of course they could well have died of something else. We are still
awaiting information of the WHO/PAHO investigation of this outbreak, so in
the meanwhile this thread is temporarily cut until there is some hard
information. - Mod.MHJ
