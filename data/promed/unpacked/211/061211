Five districts in Svay Rieng province have detected animals suffering from foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a member of the Picornaviridae family, which is highly contagious.

Department of Animal Health and Public Health director Nou Vornika said: "We have vaccines for about 25% of the 3 million cattle in the country for FMD."

"Now FMD is only detected in Svay Rieng province but I don't have the report with numbers yet," he said, adding that the affected districts are Svay Chrum, Romeas Hek, Romduol, Chantrea, and Kampong Ro.

Vornika said that FMD is one of the most contagious diseases and infects animals quickly. The disease is most common in wild and domestic animals such as pigs, cows, sheep, and goats.

He added that the symptoms cause the animal to have a fever of 40 to 41 deg Celsius [104-105.8 deg F], blisters on the mouth and tongue, and sores on the hooves which makes it difficult for animals to eat and walk.

Svay Rieng provincial agriculture department official Pen Chanthy said that the ministry has not provided the vaccination yet to inoculate cattle against FMD.

He said that last year [2021], the General Department of Animal Health and Production provided more than 80 000 doses of vaccines for cattle to prevent FMD, while Svay Rieng province has 230 000 cattle.

In response to the request for vaccinations, authorities will vaccinate cattle in 3 communes from today [10 Feb 2022].

According to the data available on the website of OIE's Regional Coordination Unit, Bangkok (southeast Asia FMD campaign, SEAFMD; http://www.arahis.oie.int/reports.php?site=seafmd), Cambodia reported during 2021 a total of 36 outbreaks of FMD; sampling and serotyping were not performed. Most outbreaks (19) occurred in January 2021, followed by February (4) and March (3).

According to the information available from the WRL FMD [World Reference Laboratory for FMD] (Pirbright), Cambodia's FMD history included serotypes O, A, and Asia1. The latter has not been circulating since 1997; FMDV-A was last recorded in 2016. Since then, only serotype O has been recorded.

The most recent genotyping results of Cambodia's FMD virus strains date back to 2019, identifying the following 2 lineages identified among the 13 submitted samples:
1. Serotype: O, topotype: ME-SA, lineage: PanAsia.
2. Serotype: O, topotype: ME-SA, lineage: Ind-2001, sublineage: e

In 2021, China donated to Cambodia 200 000 doses of FMD vaccine (https://www.cambodianewswatch.org/china-donates-another-100000-doses-of-foot-and-mouth-disease-vaccine/). Information on the vaccine strains applied currently will be of interest. - Mod.AS
