The death of 4 monkeys in a day at Morjim, Arambol and Torsem in Pernem taluka has sparked a scare among people in these areas. Authorities have dispatched samples of the dead monkeys to Pune to ascertain whether they were infected with Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD).

Sources said that the 4 monkeys, one in Morjim and Arambol and 2 at Torsem, were found dead on [Tue 12 Sep 2017]. Former Morjim sarpanch, Vaishali Shetgaonkar and locals communicated [with] the state forest department about the deaths.

Vilas Gawas, Range forest officer, Pernem informed that veterinary doctors have collected viscera samples of the dead monkeys and have been sent to Pune for analysis. He informed that the reports will be received in 15 days, which will throw more light on the exact cause of the deaths. Gawas also informed that the deaths of 2 monkeys in Torsem was due to electrocution as they were caught in high tension power cables near the electricity transformer.

Locals who assisted in the disposal of the monkeys have lamented that officials of the forest department who rushed to attend their call were ill-equipped and not provided with adequate safety equipment, thus making them susceptible to diseases.

Also, a dead monkey was found in Shigao Collem on [Mon 11 Sep 2017]. However, the health department has appealed to the people not to panic, stating that KFD outbreak cannot occur before November.

Sources said that in [Mon 13 Mar 2017] monkeys were found dead in the Maharashtra bordering villages of Torsem, Mopa and Patradevi. After 2 of the dead monkeys were found positive for KFD, the health department had commenced preventive vaccination drive in the villages of Pernem bordering Maharashtra. During that time in Banda, about 90 people suffered from monkey fever, and 34 were infected with the disease, while and 4 people have died allegedly owing to KFD.

[Kyasanur Forest disease (KFD), popularly known as monkey fever, is caused by the Kyasanur Forest disease virus (KFDV), from the family Flaviviridae. KFDV was 1st isolated from sick monkeys captured in Kyasanur Forest, Shimoga district, Karnataka state; from where it gets its name.

The KFDV cycle is maintained by ticks, mammals, and birds. The black-faced langur (_Presbytis entellus_) and the red-faced bonnet monkey (_Macaca radiata_) act as sentinel animals, as they are very susceptible to KFDV, like humans (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4545326/).

KFDV is transmitted to humans after a tick bite or contact with an infected animal, in particular a sick or recently dead monkey. However, no person-to-person transmission has been described (https://www.cdc.gov/vhf/kyasanur/transmission/index.html).

As there have been previous reports on KFDV from dead monkeys in Goa state and in Goa-Maharashtra border (see previous ProMED Mail postings listed below), the virus appears to be the most likely cause, even though 2 monkeys out of 4 in the above report were electrocuted.

However the laboratory confirmation of the samples collected from the other dead monkeys is yet to be confirmed. - Mod.UBA
