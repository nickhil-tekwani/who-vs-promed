The Tennessee State Department of Health and CDC are collaborating with
public health officials in multiple states and the Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA-FSIS) to investigate
an ongoing multistate outbreak of _E. coli_ O157:H7 infections in humans. A
study comparing foods eaten by ill people with foods eaten by well people
showed that eating frozen pizza that contained pepperoni and which was
produced by the General Mills company under the brand names of Totino's or
Jeno's was the likely source of the illness.

As of 1 Nov 2007, at least 21 isolates of _E. coli_ O157:H7 with an
indistinguishable genetic fingerprint have been collected from ill people
in 10 states: Illinois (1 person), Kentucky (3), Missouri (2), New York
(2), Ohio (1), Pennsylvania (1), South Dakota (1), Tennessee (8), Virginia
(1), and Wisconsin (1). Cases became ill between 20 Jul and 10 Oct 2007.
Their ages range from one to 65 years with a median age of 9; 53 per cent
of cases are female. At least 8 people have been hospitalized, and 4 have
developed a type of kidney failure known as hemolytic-uremic syndrome, or
HUS. No deaths have been reported.

The Tennessee State Department of Health, working with CDC and health
officials in several other states, coordinated a study to identify the
source of these infections. Eating a Totino's or Jeno's brand frozen pizza
containing pepperoni was significantly associated with illness. The source
of contamination of the pizzas is not known at this time. Company officials
are working closely with CDC, USDA-FSIS, the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), and state health and agricultural departments to identify the source
of the contamination. General Mills has ceased shipment of all frozen pizza
products that contain pepperoni and has announced a voluntary recall.

Consumers should not eat recalled Totino's or Jeno's brand frozen pizzas
that contain pepperoni as a topping. Anyone who has eaten the product but
did not become ill need not take any special action. People who are ill
with diarrhea within a week of consuming this type of frozen pizza should
seek medical care and let their doctor know about the exposure. Consumers
with questions about the recall should contact the company at
1-800-949-9055. Representatives will provide information about how to
contact the company for a full refund. Consumers are reminded to always
thoroughly cook all products that are not ready-to-eat, such as frozen
pizzas, according to package instructions.
