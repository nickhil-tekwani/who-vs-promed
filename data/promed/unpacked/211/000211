On Tue 12 Jul 2016, the Wasit Provincial Council reported cases of bird flu in a number of poultry farms in the areas north of the province (city of Kut) and directed the concerned authorities to destroy more than 2.5 million chickens. They also called on the Ministry of Health to take urgent measures to control the spread of the disease.

The head of the Agriculture Committee, Hashim al-Awadi, held a press conference in the House of Wasit province, Kut's city center, and stated: "The health and veterinary authorities recorded cases of infections of bird flu among poultry in farm areas of Essaouira and Aziziyah, north of the province."

[There are several additional reports on the event in Iraqi media (eg http://bit.ly/2a18iWF, dated 10 Jul 2016). The Iraqi veterinary services notified the OIE on 25 Apr 2016 an extensive HPAI H5N1 epizootic, spread from the governorate Dohuk on the Turkish border in the north to the southern governorate Al Qadisiyah (see, with a link to the outbreaks map, in post archive no.20160426.4184541). According to the said OIE report, the event had started on 16 Dec 2015. On 4 May 2016, a follow-up/final report was submitted, claiming the event as resolved (see at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=20135).

It remains to be considered if a new epizootic has recently started in Iraq or that the claim on the event resolved was optimistic.

HPAI H5N1 has been reported, during 2016, from eastern Lebanon, adjacent to the Syrian border, reportedly due to "illegal movement of poultry". This, and the reports from Iraq, may indicate that the circulation of the virus in Syria - situated between Lebanon and Iraq -- is most likely. Alertness in other countries in the region is essential.

In Lebanon, an HPAI H5N1 contingency plan, prepared with FAO support in 2007, has been activated. - Mod.AS
