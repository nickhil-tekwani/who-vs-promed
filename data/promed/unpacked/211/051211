New York City health officials are reporting a case of a baby with neonatal herpes following direct orogenital suction (DOS) during ritual Jewish circumcision. This is the 1st case of neonatal herpes related to DOS during ritual Jewish circumcision reported to the Health Department since March 2017.

Direct orogenital suction (DOS) during ritual Jewish circumcision (also known as metzitzah b'peh) is a practice during which a mohel (religious circumciser) uses his mouth to suck blood away from the penile circumcision wound. DOS can transmit herpes simplex virus (HSV) to newborn males, which can cause severe infection, resulting in brain damage and death.

According to health officials, the infant was circumcised on the 8th day of life by a mohel who performed DOS. Ten days later, the infant developed a rash on his genitals, groin, and buttocks. A specimen taken from one of the child's lesions tested positive for Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The infant was hospitalized to complete a 14-day course of intravenous acyclovir and is doing well.

In this case, the child's caretakers were not aware of the signs and symptoms of neonatal herpes nor the risk of herpes transmission associated with DOS, resulting in a delay in the child presenting for care. Signs and symptoms may include: a vesicular or pustular rash (following DOS, these lesions typically appear on the genitals, groin, buttocks and ankle (related dermatomes)); fever; poor feeding; irritability; and lethargy. Fever and rash are not always present, so a historical exposure such as DOS should raise suspicion for an atypical presentation of neonatal herpes.

Since April 2006 (when neonatal herpes reporting became mandatory in NYC), there have been a total of 164 laboratory-confirmed babies with neonatal herpes. Of these cases, 19 (12%) developed their infections following ritual Jewish circumcision.

[Most adults have been infected with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) whether they have had a history of recurrent ulcers on the lips or not and will intermittently have HSV in their saliva even without any obvious lesions. It is during that time that the risk of transmission exists.

Davis (Davis DS. Ancient rites and new laws: how should we regulate religious circumcision of minors? J Med Ethics. 2013; 39(7): 456-8) claims that between 2000 and 2011, 11 children died in New York and New Jersey following infection by herpes simplex virus, presumably from infected practitioners. But a review by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] (CDC. Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection following Jewish ritual circumcisions that included direct orogenital suction -- New York City, 2000-2011. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2012; 61(22): 405-9) states that only 2 deaths occurred during the period, with an overall risk of the entity estimated at 1 in 4098 or 3.4 times greater than the risk among male infants considered unlikely to have had direct orogenital suction.

A discussion of the issues from Israel (Gesundheit B, Grisaru-Soen G, Greenberg D, et al. Neonatal genital herpes simplex virus type 1 infection after Jewish ritual circumcision: modern medicine and religious tradition. Pediatrics. 2004; 114(2): e259-63 (http://www.academia.edu/24186235/Neonatal_Genital_Herpes_Simplex_Virus_Type_1_Infection_After_Jewish_Ritual_Circumcision_Modern_Medicine_and_Religious_Tradition) includes the following extract regarding the history of the subject related to infection prevention:

"According to Biblical law, a male infant should be circumcised at the age of 8 days as a sign of the eternal covenant between God and the Jewish people (Genesis 17:10-14; Leviticus 12:3). According to classical rabbinical interpretation, performance of this religious ritual offers medical advantages, a view upheld by many modern medical authorities, as noted earlier. The Babylonian Talmud, the main rabbinical literature completed in the 5th century of the common era, states that for the sake of the infant, the mohel is obliged to perform the metzitzah "so as not to bring on risk." The nature of the risk was not specified. It specifically states that "this procedure is performed for the sake of the infant's safety, and if a mohel does not perform the suction [of the wound], this is deemed dangerous, and he is to be dismissed." To prevent medical complications, the Talmud permits only an experienced and responsible mohel to perform the ritual circumcision. The Talmud was aware of potential medical problems that could arise from ritual circumcision [13] and, in fact, provided the 1st description of hemophilia in the history of medicine, manifested as a familial bleeding disorder that required circumcision to be postponed [14].

"In the 19th century, Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis (1818-1865) established the principles of hygiene and disease transmission [15] after neonatal tuberculosis was documented after circumcision by an infected mohel [16]. Since then, most rabbinical authorities modified their approach in response to these findings. Because the Talmudic injunction to perform metzitzah did not explicitly stipulate oral suction, more than 160 years ago, Rabbi Moses Schreiber (Pressburg, 1762-1839), a leading rabbinical authority, ruled that metzitzah could be conducted by instrumental suction [16], a ruling quickly adopted by most rabbinical authorities [17]. Consequently, the great majority of ritual circumcisions are performed today with a sterile device and not by oral suction by the mohel. However, some orthodox rabbis have felt threatened by criticism of the old religious customs and strongly resist any change in the traditional custom of oral metzitzah. The cultural process of replacing ancient customs by modern wound care has to be encouraged by a heightened awareness of this potentially life-threatening medical complication [16].

"On the basis of our observations, the medico-legal impact of neonatal infection by the mohel has to be redefined. Our findings provide evidence that ritual Jewish circumcision with oral metzitzah may cause oral-genital transmission of HSV infection, resulting in clinical disease including involvement of the skin, mucous membranes, and HSV encephalitis. Furthermore, oral suction may not only endanger the child but also may expose the mohel to human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis B from infected infants. The same consideration that led the Talmudic sages once to establish the custom of the metzitzah for the sake of the infant could now be applied to persuade the mohel to use instrumental suction."
