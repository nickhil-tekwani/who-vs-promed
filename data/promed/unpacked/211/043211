Highly pathogenic avian influenza (poultry), Chinese Taipei
-------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 11 Jan 2015 from Dr Ping-Cheng Yang, director, Animal Technology Institute Taiwan, Council of Agriculture, Taiwan, Chinese Taipei

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 8 Jan 2015
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 11 Jan 2015
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 29 Jul 2014
Manifestation of disease: clinical infection
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N8
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Da-Lin Township, Chiayi County
Date of start of the outbreak: 8 Jan 2015
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 5200 / 3683 / 3683 / - / -
Affected population: breeding geese

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Birds / 70.83 / 70.83 / 100 / **
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter
** Not calculated because of missing information

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comment: Abnormal mortality was noticed and reported to the local disease control center by the owner of the breeding goose farm. Two dead geese were taken from the farm for diagnosis, and the farm has been put under movement restrictions since then. Specific RNA product of avian influenza virus was detected and subtyped as H5N8 by RT-PCR. Highly pathogenic avian influenza was confirmed by the National Laboratory based on sequencing analysis of the HA0 cleavage site. All the geese on the infected farm will be culled. The actual number of culled geese will be available when stamping out is finished and will be reported in the next follow-up report. Thorough cleaning and disinfection will be conducted after the stamping out operation. Surrounding poultry farms within a 3-km radius of the infected farm are under intensified surveillance for 3 months.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; movement control inside the country; screening; zoning; disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s); vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type:
Animal Health Research Institute (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Test date / Result:
Birds / gene sequencing / 11 Jan 2015 / Positive
Birds / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 11 Jan 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

[This is the 1st time that highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza has been identified in Taiwan.

According to information found in the public media, this HPAI H5N8 is genetically similar to one now circulating in the Republic of Korea. News reports say that: "The H5 subtype is 99 percent similar to the South Korean strain, while the N8 subtype is 98 percent similar." See http://www.taiwannews.com.tw/etn/news_content.php?id=2666697 and ProMED-mail archive number 20150112.3087008.

Media reports also indicate that the authorities suspect that the disease has been spreading by migratory birds (see http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/01/12/asia-pacific/taiwan-confirms-first-case-of-h5n8-bird-flu/#.VLQdrSx0zIU and http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2015-01/11/c_133911539.htm).

The 1st poultry cases of highly pathogenic strain H5N8 were reported in January 2014 from the authorities of the Republic of Korea. To date, it has been reported in Japan, China, Germany, The Netherlands, United Kingdom, Italy and USA.

What are the food safety recommendations?
Animals which have been culled as a result of control measures in response to an outbreak of avian influenza, including the A(H5N8) virus, should not enter the food and feed chains as a precautionary and regulatory measure. There is no evidence to suggest that the consumption of poultry meat or eggs could transmit the AI virus to humans.

What is the public health risk associated with avian influenza?
AI viruses are highly species-specific but have, on rare occasions, crossed the species barrier to infect humans. This disease should not be confused with seasonal human influenza (flu), a very common human disease (generally caused by human H1 and H3 viruses). Transmission of AI viruses to humans occurs when there is close contact with infected birds or heavily contaminated environments. Currently, there is no evidence of human infection from influenza A(H5N8) virus http://www.oie.int/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-high-pathogenic-h5n8-avian-influenza-strain-update-27112014/. - Mod.CRD
