Congratulations to Charlie Calisher for raising the troubling issue of the
expense and general unavailability of ribavirin, a life-saving drug needed
in West Africa. I gave a fair amount of thought to this problem while I
was at the Rockefeller Foundation, but did not move as far as I had hoped.
1. We discovered that ribavirin is manufactured in China (possibly not
under ICN license) where it is rather inexpensive.
2. This is a problem which the WHO Regional Office for Africa needs
to address. This is a perfect opportunity for one or more donor countries
make funds available to purchase ribavirin, reduce Lassa mortality and make
an important humanitarian statement.
3. UNICEF has a relevant program called the Bamako Initiative
(I believe) in which soft currencies go into a UNICEF account to pay for
local programs while UNICEF uses hard currency to purchase pharmaceuticals
on the open market. How much of the Lassa morbidity and mortality is in
children?

[Thanks, Scott. This morning we received a message from Richard T. Gannon
(President & CEO, TUTT Group, 3710 E. Ovid Ave., Des Moines, Iowa, U.S.A.
50317; TEL: 515-265-9500, FAX: 515-265-9502 e-mail: <tutt@tuttgroup.com>;
http://www.tuttgroup.com) saying that "TUTT group represents a pharmaceutical
exporter from India for export to Africa. Presently they have Ribavirin
available. However, please recheck at the time of order.

Cap. Ribavirin 100 mg. : US$ 3.50/Pack of 4 capsules.
Cap. Ribavirin 200 mg. : US$ 6.90/Pack of 4 capsules.
Syrup Ribavirin 50mg./5ml : US$ 2.75/30ml Bottles.
The above is correct and accurate as it was represented to me by the
exporter in India."
Again, oral ribavirin.
The ADFL army is closing in on Kinshasa and may overrun it before very long.
Who knows where those soldiers have been? Will US and other UN forces be
deployed on the ground in Zaire? In Kinshasa, to protect embassies and their
staffs and other expatriates?
The last thing any of us would like to see are congressional hearings as to
why what could occur did. - Once again: Who's in charge here? -- Mod CHC]
