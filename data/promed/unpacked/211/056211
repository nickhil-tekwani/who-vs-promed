4 cases of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis were diagnosed at the
Ha' Emek Medical Center, Afula [North District], Israel
During the last 3 weeks, 4 inhabitants of the Afula surroundings were
hospitalized due to fever, headache, confusional state, and stupor.
These inhabitants included 2 females (58 and 64 years old) and 2
males (40 and 66 years old). [Of these,] 2 were immunocompromised
(one with colon carcinoma after chemotherapy, and the 2nd after
kidney transplantation); one suffered from diabetes mellitus type 2,
and the last was a healthy patient. One of them recalls a mosquito
bite one week before the fever started.
After hospitalization, a complete work-up was done: CT (computerized
tomography) and EEG (electroencephalography) did not show
abnormalities. Lumbar puncture was compatible with viral
encephalitis; Gram stain, spinal fluid cultures, and PCR [polymerase
chain reaction] for herpes simplex virus [HSV] were negative. All of
them received empirical treatment with Acyclovir IV... Because of a
more severe clinical presentation, the kidney transplant patient
received IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin -- 0.5 g/kg/day for 4 days).
The diagnosis of WNV was confirmed by seroconversion in serum and CSF
(cerebrospinal fluid) samples. [Seroconversion means that there were
no WN antibodies in serum or CSF taken during the acute phase of
illness, but they were present in those fluids taken during
convalescence. - Mod.JW]
All the patients completely recovered and were discharged without
neurological signs or symptoms.
