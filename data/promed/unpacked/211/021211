FDA today approved Synercid, the first antibacterial drug to treat
infections associated with vancomycin-resistant _Enterococcus faecium_
bacteremia (VREF) when no alternative treatment is available. Synercid also
received approval for complicated skin and skin structure infections. The
following may be used to respond to questions.
Infections due to _E. faecium_ are particularly known to occur in
hospitalized or immunocompromised individuals. This organism is often
resistant to multiple antibiotics. Vancomycin has, for many years, served
as the last resort for treatment of these infections. In 1989 the first
case of vancomycin-resistant _E. faecium_ (VREF) was reported in this
country. Since then, there has been a rapid increase in the incidence of
VREF.
Synercid, a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin, is the first drug
in the streptogramin class approved for use in humans in the United States.
The drug has been granted accelerated approval, a regulatory mechanism that
allows early approval for products intended to treat serious or life-
threatening conditions when they provide meaningful therapeutic benefit
over existing treatments. Accelerated approval is based on surrogate
markers of effectiveness, in this case, the drugs' ability to clear VREF
infection from the bloodstream. A study to verify the clinical benefit
(e.g., resolution of the specific site of infection) of therapy with
Synercid is underway.
Synercid's approval was supported by clinical trials of more than 2000
patients; 1222 patients were treated with Synercid in four non-comparative
studies for treatment of VREF infections. In general, these patients were
severely ill, making many of them unable to be fully evaluated for purposes
of the clinical trials. For those who were able to be evaluated, based on
strict study criteria, the overall effectiveness rate of Synercid was 52
percent. Sources of VREF infection included intra-abdominal sites, skin,
soft tissue and the urinary tract. Additionally 330 of the enrolled VREF
patients (out of the original 1222) had VREF bacteremia of unknown origin.
For this subgroup, 90 percent had clearance of VREF in the first 48 to 72
hours of starting therapy.
Synercid was also found to be safe and effective for treatment of skin and
soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-susceptible _Staphylcoccus
aureus_ (MSSA) and by _Streptococcus pyogenes_ in two controlled clinical
trials. In these studies 450 patients enrolled in the Synercid arms were
compared with 443 patients treated with antibacterial drugs oxacillin or
cefazolin.
The most frequently reported side effects attributed to Synercid in the
clinical studies were muscle and joint pain, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and
rash. In studies in which the drug was administered through a peripheral
vein (e.g., in the arm) many patients experienced local reactions to the
injection, including pain and inflammation at the catheter injection site.
FDA's approval follows the recommendations of the Anti-Infective Drugs
Advisory Committee. Their recommendation for the approval of the VREF
indication was based, in addition to the results of the clinical studies,
on the lack of availability of approved drugs for the treatment of this
resistant infection which may be serious and life-threatening.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, a French company with US headquarters in Collegeville,
Pa., will market Synercid in the United States.
