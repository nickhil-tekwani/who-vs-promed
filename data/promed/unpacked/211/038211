Surge of cutaneous Leishmaniasis in Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan
------------------------------------
Cutaneous leishmaniasis is on the increase in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), according to reports by FATA's Directorate of Health.

In response, the international medical organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors Without Borders (MSF) has donated supplies of medicines to treat the disease.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is the common form of leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies. It causes ulcer-like lesions and can lead to severe disfigurement. If left untreated, it can complicate by affecting
internal organs.

FATA is endemic to leishmaniasis. The recent surge in cases saw 1335 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis treated from January to March 2013, according to the FATA Directorate of Health, an increase of over 270 cases compared to the same period last year [2012]. MSF donated 1200 vials of the drug Meglumine Antimoniate (Glucantime) in the last week of April [2013]. This was almost 30 percent of the quantity that had been requested across FATA for an entire year, based on last year's patient numbers.

Since the 1st reported outbreak in FATA in 2002, the Health Directorate launched a national response programme in 2003 to tackle the disease. The World Health Organization's Disease Early Warning System (DEWS) programme has been supporting the treatment of the disease in FATA since 2010. The sudden increase in cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis reverses a trend, which had seen cases fall over recent years.

During 2012, MSF treated 298 patients for the disease at the Sadda Tehsil Headquarter hospital in Kurram Agency - a 50 percent drop on the previous year. "Timely treatment of the disease was a big factor in the significant drop in cases in the area," said MSF medical coordinator Dr Isaac Chikwanha. Using bed nets reduces the risk of being bitten by sand flies and infected with the disease

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis, CL, is endemic in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. The fall of the Taliban regime showed that the country had experienced a huge increase in cases, with no proper control measures being implemented and treatment facilities grossly inadequate. CL increased in Pakistan with the increase in refugees from Afghanistan. The present increase needs to be analysed further. Were the cases refugees or residents in FATA? When were they exposed? With an incubation period of up to 4 months or even longer a history of movements over the past months is needed to understand the dynamics of the infection.

Prevalence rates are provided in the ProMED posting the 3rd March 2013 (see below). - Mod. EP
