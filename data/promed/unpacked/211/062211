Egypt: new suspected human case of avian influenza
--------------------------------------------------
Egyptian health minister Hatem el-Gabali announced on Sun 26 Mar 2006 that
a new suspected case of human avian influenza had been found in the
country's Nile delta region, the Egyptian official MENA news agency reported.
The patient was being treated in a local hospital in the Governorate of
Kafr el-Sheikh, some 125 km north of Cairo. The 18 year old girl, who had
come into contact with dead birds, started to show avian influenza symptoms
on Thu 23 Mar 2006, including high temperature, sore throat and muscle
ache, according to the report. Members of her family are currently being
tested for avian influenza virus infection.
The latest case brought to 5 the total number of suspected human bird flu
cases in the populous north African country. Egypt confirmed on 18 Mar 2006
that a woman who had been raising chickens at home died of H5N1 avian
influenza virus, the 1st human case of the lethal disease in the country.
[As of 24 Mar 2006, this case has not appeared in the WHO cumulative list
of confirmed human cases of avian influenza. - Mod.CP]. The other patients
either have recovered or are still under treatment in hospitals.
Egypt reported the 1st case of the H5N1 strain of bird flu in dead poultry
on 17 Feb 2006, and the government has since taken tough measures to curb
the spread of the disease. The H5N1 avian influenza virus has killed over
100 people worldwide since its outbreak in South East Asia in late 2003,
according to the World Health Organization. Most victims were infected
after close contact with sick birds. The virus currently can only jump from
birds to humans, but scientists fear that it could mutate into a form
capable of passing easily among humans and thus spark a global human flu
pandemic which might kill millions.

Egypt: 5th suspected human avian influenza case
-----------------------------------------------
A 5th person in Egypt has caught what appears to be avian influenza, but
her condition is good, Egypt's health minister said on Sun [26 Mar 2006].
Hatem el-Gabali said samples taken from an 18 year old girl were being
tested for avian influenza virus infection, which has already killed one
Egyptian, Egypt's state news agency, MENA, reported.
The girl, from the village of Miniet Quellin, north west of Cairo, had been
treated with Tamiflu (oseltamivir), the drug used to fight bird flu in
humans. She began to feel unwell 4 days ago and checked into hospital on
Sat [25 Mar 2006], he said. She had handled dead birds, he said.
Two other Egyptians suspected of [contracting avian influenza] left
hospital on Sunday [26 Mar 2006]. Another is still being treated in
hospital. The disease is difficult for humans to catch but can be caught
through contact with infected birds.
