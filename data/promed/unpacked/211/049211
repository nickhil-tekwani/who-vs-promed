The EVD outbreak in West Africa has killed 2288 people, with half of them dying in the last 3 weeks, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. It said that 47 percent of the deaths and 49 percent of the total 4269 cases had come in the 21 days leading up to 6 Sep 2014. The health agency warned that thousands more cases could occur in Liberia, which has had the most fatalities.

In Nigeria, 8 people have died out of 21 cases, while one case of EVD has been confirmed in Senegal, the WHO said in its latest update.

On Mon [9 Sep 2014], the agency called on organisations combating the outbreak in Liberia to scale up efforts to control the outbreak "3-4 fold."

[2] PPE: proper procedures

http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/for_ebola_health_care_workers_how_protective_gear_is_removed_poses_risk_of_deadly_exposure_experts_caution


A team of American infectious disease and critical care experts is alerting colleagues caring for EVD patients that how they remove their personal protective gear can be just as crucial as wearing it to prevent exposure to the deadly virus.

In a commentary published online on 26 Aug 2014 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the physician-specialists from Johns Hopkins and the University of North Carolina say rigorous steps exist -- and must be taken -- to avoid "inadvertent" contact of frontline caregivers' exposed skin and mucous membranes to infected body fluids.

Personal protective equipment [PPE], including goggles or face shields, gloves and gowns, are effectively decreasing West African caregivers' exposure to infected bodily fluids, but workers are still at risk "if removal of protective clothing that is contaminated with infectious bodily fluids is not done in a manner that prevents exposure," say the authors...

"The physical exhaustion and emotional fatigue that come with caring for patients infected with Ebola may further increase the chance of an inadvertent exposure to bodily fluids on the outside of the personal protective equipment, leading to unwanted contact when the gear is removed," the authors say. "The impulse to wipe away sweat in the ever-present hot, humid environment during personal protective equipment removal may lead to inadvertent inoculation of mucous membranes" in and on the nose, mouth and eyes.

Despite the challenges of preventing inadvertent exposure from improper personal protective equipment removal, they say that health care workers are generally aware of and are using proper precautions. For example, treatment sites in Africa administered by Medecins Sans Frontieres [MSF, Doctors Without Borders], a medical humanitarian organization, has established a systematic process to mitigate the risks associated with removal of personal protective equipment, including a buddy system in which health care workers walk each other through each step of the removal process to help ensure safety...

"... Providing an adequate supply of personal protective equipment, along with a ritualized process for donning and doffing personal protective equipment, are desperately needed to prevent further unnecessary infection and loss of life among the heroic health care workers who are on the front lines of this war," the authors write in the commentary.

[3] Nigeria: syringe attack at Lagos Airport

An American federal air marshal was placed in quarantine in Houston, Texas yesterday [8 Sep 2014] after being attacked Sunday night [8 Sep 2014] at the Lagos, Nigeria airport. The assailant ... was able to inject an unknown substance into the back of one of the air marshal's arms. The marshal was able to board the United Airlines flight to Houston, USA where he was met by FBI agents and health workers from the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC)...

The air marshal, who was in Nigeria with a team of other marshals, was attacked when the group was in an unsecured area of the airport terminal in Lagos... ABC News also reports that while the unknown assailant escaped, Nigerian officials said the other air marshals on the team secured the needle and brought it on the flight for testing in the United States... Officials noted that US air marshals travel undercover in plain clothes, and an attacker would not be able to identify his target as an American law enforcement agent.

[4] Ghana: bush meat

An estimated 28 000 straw-coloured fruit bats [scientific name _Eidolon helvum_], valued at Ghc 256 000 [USD 6.00 each], are sold annually in Ghana as bush meat, Dr. Joseph Somuah Akuamoah, Executive Member of Good Life Ghana, has said. He said the bats were sold in just a 400 km radius, an indication of the role bush meat, which is a source of Ebola virus disease (EVD) infection, could play in the spread of the disease in case of an outbreak in [Ghana]. He has, therefore, re-echoed calls for the reduction of bushmeat consumption, with a stern caution to hunters against dead animals they find during hunting, since the game might have died of EVD due to infection in one of the affected countries.
