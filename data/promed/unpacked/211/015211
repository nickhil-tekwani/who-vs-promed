UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, UNICEF and WHO are assisting the Namibian government in the fight against an outbreak of hepatitis E on the outskirts of the national capital, Windhoek. More than 800 people are suspected of having contracted hepatitis, while 5 people have died from the disease.

The outbreak was 1st reported in October 2017. Of the 5 who have died, 3 were women in the post-partum period. The outbreak is concentrated in the informal settlements of Havana, Goreangab, Hakahana, Greenwell Matongo, Ombili, and the broader Katutura. A majority of the patients are from the informal settlements of Havana and Goreangab.

Hepatitis E is a liver infection spread either by direct contact with an infected person's feces or by indirect fecal contamination of food or water. Infection is more severe among pregnant women as they are at greater risk of acute liver failure, fetal loss and death. The outbreak is fueled mainly by a lack of clean water, poor sanitation and poor personal hygiene.

Since the outbreak, the Ministry of Health and Social Services has carried out assessments in 2500 households in the affected areas, where an average household consists of 4 people. The assessment showed that 68 per cent of households defecate in the open, 92 per cent of them collect water from communal taps, while 2 per cent collect water from open/unsafe water sources. Only 6 per cent have household taps.

The President, Hage Geingob, visited the affected areas in Havana informal settlement in February 2018 and emphasized the importance of basic sanitation, as hepatitis E is not an inherited disease like cancer and other ailments but spread through poor hygiene. He also urged communities to stop vandalizing public toilets and to take care of them, as they belong to them.

[This article MAY provide some important potential insight into why there is a substantially increased maternal mortality rate related to hepatitis E virus:

Kmush BL, Labrique A, Li W, et al. The association of cytokines and micronutrients with hepatitis E virus infection during pregnancy and the postpartum period in rural Bangladesh. Am J Trop Med Hyg 2016; 94(1): 203-11. doi: 10.4269/ajtmh.15-0238; available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4710431/.

Abstract
--------
"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection is severe during pregnancy, with a pregnant case fatality rate around 30 per cent. In Bangladesh, plasma samples from 1100 women during the 1st trimester (TM) and 3rd TM of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum (PP) were tested for anti-HEV IgG. During this time, 40 women developed antibody responses to HEV. These seroconverters are classified as the cases (incidence = 46 infections per 1000 person-years). All except one seroconversion occurred between the 3rd TM and 3 months PP. The cases and 40 matched non-seroconverters (controls) underwent analysis of a panel of 10 cytokines, 12 vitamins and minerals, and 2 markers of inflammation. Throughout pregnancy, seroconverting cases displayed higher concentrations of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines compared with the non-seroconverting controls, even prior to infection. In the 1st TM, seroconverters had lower circulating zinc concentrations (P = 0.03), an increased prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)2D] less than 50 nmol/L, P = 0.08), and anemia (hemoglobin less than 110 g/L, P = 0.05) compared with controls. There were no differences in C-reactive protein or alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Antecedent micronutrient deficiencies may lead to dysregulated cytokine expression and immunologic compromise, increasing the risk of HEV infection, especially during pregnancy. This exploratory analysis reveals potential novel associations that deserve further study."

Of the 7 genotypes of HEV, it seems that GT 1 and 2 are the ones that are associated with this increased mortality during gestation. Those genotypes appear to be transmitted from humans, whereas the others, most notably GT 3, are zoonotic infections spread usually by undercooked pork products. - Mod.LL
