A group of [Lake Forest] area professionals is seeking to get to the bottom of an avian botulism outbreak at area creeks and ponds, according to the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center [WWCC] of north Orange County [OC].

Officials have taken to the skies to find birds affected by the disease with the help of a professional drone pilot and OC Parks. At the end of August [2021], a sick mallard hen and a dead mallard drake were found in the Lake Forest area during the avian botulism outbreak, officials say, along with a group of sick Canadian geese.

The presence of avian botulism in the area is largely due to the drought, experts say. Outbreaks, according to the Wetland and Wildlife Care Center experts, develop as a result of one or more of the following conditions: flooding of dry land during warm weather, resulting in the drowning of terrestrial invertebrates that then provide a nutrient medium for the bacterium; receding water levels that expose mudflats, causing aquatic invertebrates to die which then provides a suitable nutrient medium; changes in water quality that result in the death of invertebrate fauna; decaying animal carcasses that provide maggots.

Botulism toxin kills quickly, so waterfowl succumb within normal weight and no sign of weight loss. Because the birds don't eat while they are ill, bile stains the vent green (as does lead poisoning). Sick birds have difficulty holding their heads erect, so the term "limber neck" is often applied when the caustic agent is unknown, the center says.

After the last outing, the survey team was able to rescue the sick hen, reaching her with the aid of a boat and some local residents. The geese are being monitored by residents, and once captured, they will be able to convalesce at the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center.

Many birds have lost their lives to this toxic disease, Debbie McGuire, executive director of the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center said. "The hen was nearly drowned and at first residents weren't sure if she was even alive," McGuire said.

According to the Wildlife Center's veterinarian, Dr Elizabeth Wood, there are 10 mallards and 2 Canada geese in intensive care.

"The quicker these patients can arrive at WWCC, the better their chances for survival," Wood says. "We expect this outbreak to be ongoing due to the drought and receding water levels throughout Orange County."

Thanks to the help of Orange County Supervisor Katrina Foley, a hiccup in the plan was smoothed over, according to McGuire. The drones were able to fly over the research area to identify concentrations of birds in heavy vegetation.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin. Decomposing vegetation and invertebrates combined with warm temperatures can provide ideal conditions for the botulism bacteria to activate and produce toxin. There are several types of toxin produced by strains of these bacteria; birds are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. - Mod.PMB
