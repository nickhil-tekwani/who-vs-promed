1 dead, 3 hospitalized due to food poisoning
--------------------------------------------
A 5-year-old girl died while 3 of her siblings were rushed to the
hospital after eating camote crops they found in a field, just a few
weeks after the Bohol and Tarlac food poisoning disasters. The girl,
of Barangay San Isidro, Libona, Bukidnon, died just a few minutes
after eating camote on Sat, 19 Mar 2005.
The 3 other victims were 2, 4, and 7 years old and were rushed to the
Northern Mindanao Medical Center (NMMC) for treatment. Doctors at the
hospital declared the children as already safe.
The victims' father told Sun Star that the wild crops were cooked by
the victims and mixed in their porridge. "I wasn't there since I was
at the field, but when I reached the house I was surprised to see the
children vomit and hear them complain that their stomachs hurt," he
said.
The father said that after the incident, he went around asking his
neighbors what his children ate. They told him that they saw the
children picking camote crops in a farm at around 10 am. The farm has
been abandoned for quite sometime. After getting several of the
camote, the children decided to go back to their house and cooked
them with porridge.
"Though clinical manifestations (of food poisoning) were present,
just the same we would still conduct investigations to clarify
whether it was really the crops that had poison," Dr. Evelyn Clarete,
hospital chief, said. She said she also suggested to the victims'
parents to bring all the kitchen utensils used by the children to
cook the porridge for examination.
Clarete said it is unlikely that camote, a favorite produce among
Filipinos and sold anywhere in the public markets and even malls, is
toxic.

[Camote is a type of sweet potato having somewhat dry, bland,
yellowish to white flesh, used as a staple food in many tropical
countries, and is also called boniato or batata. Not known to be
toxic, the cause of this illness is likely a pesticide or other toxic
substance contaminating the potato or ingested with it. - Mod.LL]
