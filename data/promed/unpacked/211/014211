Romanian doctors are being investigated for malpractice after a 5 year old girl in their care died of rabies. Health officials have said the girl was bitten by a stray dog in December [2011] in a village in eastern Romania and initially received an anti-tetanus jab from the doctors.

In February [2012], she was hospitalized at a unit that treats infectious diseases in the city of Iasi where she died on 27 Feb 2012. Veterinary health spokesman Gheorghita Vlad said on Tuesday [6 Mar 2012] that dogs were being examined for rabies in the village where the girl was bitten. Health official Marin Bustuc said the doctors are being investigated. Rabies is a deadly virus that spreads to humans from the saliva of infected animals. The disease affects the central nervous system and brain.

[Rabies is prevalent in both domestic animals and wildlife throughout Romania.

The WHO Rabies-Bulletin-Europe on 20 Dec 2011 reported the tragic death of a young girl from Romania following the bite of a rabid cat. Post-exposure prophylaxis was not administered. The girl was hospitalized after the 1st signs of disease and treated according to the Milwaukee protocol, but without success http://www.who-rabies-bulletin.org/service/news.aspx. If the incident described in the above press report is indeed a different case, in view of this prior experience, it is surprising that the child in the incident described above did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis.

Iasi is one of the largest cities and a municipality in Romania, located in the north eastern region of Moldavia. A map of Romania showing the location of Iasi can be accessed at http://wwp.greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/europe/european-union/romania/map/index.htm. - Mod.CP
