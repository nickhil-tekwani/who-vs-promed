Porton Biopharma [PBL] has signed a modification to its existing agreement with the US National Institute of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) worth USD 4.5 million to take its intranasal anthrax vaccine into phase 1 clinical trials.

The news follows acceptance by the FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] of the investigational new drug [IND] application submitted by the company. The trial is set to bring together Porton Biopharma's recombinant protective anthrax antigen and clinical-stage firm Blue Willow's novel intranasal NanoVax system, delivering "a more effective product than currently licensed vaccines by enabling immunity to be achieved in fewer doses and via intra-nasal delivery, instead of injection." Blue Willow will also handle the execution of the study.

The trial, which under the contract will be entirely financed from NIAID, is potentially worth up to USD 24 million if all options are exercised over its 8-year duration.

"We are delighted that we are able to progress into the clinical phase of the contract and this latest award is a recognition of all the hard work of staff at PBL and its partner Blue Willow, especially in writing, reviewing and gaining approval for the IND from the FDA," commented Dr Roger Hinton Managing Director of Porton Biopharma. "This is a pivotal study that builds on the research and development that has been used to progress this novel product to date by PBL and its partners in collaboration with NIAID's technical team. It is a recognition of the knowledge and expertise within the company and demonstrates the ability of PBL to further deliver on our track record of developing and manufacturing life-saving products for worldwide markets."

[We live in interesting times with the emergence, albeit experimental at this time, of more effective human vaccines for this disease. PBL and NIAID, to go forward into actual clinical trials, will presumably involve human test subjects being blood sampled, then subjected to an intranasal spray, wait 2 weeks, and then rebled to check for any useful blood titre. As I presume some rabbits have already been exposed to this nasal vaccine there won't be many nails bitten while awaiting the result of human exposures. The benefits of an intranasal vaccine delivery is that it gets over the fuss of injections and will allow more people to be vaccinated in a shorter time. Similarly if multiple sprays have to be used, there will be a lower no-show rate. - Mod.MHJ
