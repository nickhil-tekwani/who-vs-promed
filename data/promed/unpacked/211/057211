Ten more cases of polio with the P3 strain of the virus have been
detected in Bihar over the past week, taking the toll of children
afflicted by the P3 strain in the state to 33 this year [2007].

Uttar Pradesh has the largest number of P3-positive cases (235),
followed by Bihar and Uttarakhand (4).

[The monthly update for September/October 2007 available at the polio
eradication website gives the following information (as of 16 Oct 2007):

"- In 2007, 304 cases have been reported (64 type 1 and 240 type 3).
India has the highest number of cases of any single country in 2007
(note that as of 24 Oct 2007, the number of reported cases is 326:
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp#details>).

- 17 cases of type 3 polio were reported in Bihar state, the 1st type
3 cases there since January 2004. Genetic sequencing has confirmed
that they are related to type 3 circulating in western Uttar Pradesh.
In response, a monovalent OPV type 3 (mOPV3) campaign was held in
both states at the end of September/early October [2007]. Although
the eradication of type 1 is the strategic priority, contingency
plans for potential re-infection with type 3 have been made, and a
sufficient supply of mOPV3 was already available in Bihar.

- Polio campaigns proceeded in August [2007] despite extensive
flooding in Bihar. In particularly hard-hit areas of central and
north-western Bihar, campaigns were held after a delay of several
days. Flood prone areas were identified ahead of time; WHO technical
staff were re-deployed to these areas, and extra vaccination teams
were put in place. Monovalent OPV1 was systematically administered
during relief activities. Partnerships are being strengthened at the
local level to offer additional health support, including de-worming
tablets and Vitamin A supplements"
(<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/current_monthly_sitrep.asp>).

According to the WHO India website, as of 20 Oct 2007, the most
recent confirmed polio case in Bihar had a date of onset of 27 Sep
2007 and had a poliovirus type 1 isolated. In contrast, the state of
Uttar Pradesh reported the most recent confirmed polio case with date
of onset 28 Sep 2007 with a poliovirus type 3 isolated. Other states
with most recent cases identifying a poliovirus type 3 included
Uttarakhand (date of onset 10 Sep 2007), Rajasthan (date of onset 6
Sep 2007), Haryana (date of onset 27 Aug 2007), Haryana (date of
onset 27 Aug 2007) and Delhi (date of onset 24 Aug 2007). As of 20
Oct 2007, there had been 56 confirmed cases of polio in Bihar for
2007, of which 33 cases had a poliovirus type 1 isolated (involving
16 districts), and 23 cases had a poliovirus type 3 isolated
(involving 10 districts). This is in contrast with 2006 data from
Bihar, where there were 61 confirmed cases, all of which had
poliovirus type 1 isolated (involving 25 districts). In total, there
have been 327 cases of polio confirmed as of 20 Oct 2007, of which 66
had poliovirus type 1 identified and 261 had poliovirus type 3
identified. In contrast, in 2006, there were 676 polio cases with
laboratory confirmation, of which 648 had poliovirus type 1
identified and 28 had poliovirus type 3 identified. One suspects this
reflects the successes of the monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine type
1 (mOPV1) in significantly reducing circulation of poliovirus type 1,
and now with the implementation of monovalent oral poliovirus type 3
(mOPV3) campaigns, a similar reduction in circulation of WPV-3 should occur
(<http://www.npspindia.org/bulletin.pdf>).

[2] Sudan (Darfur)

UN agencies and Sudanese health officials began a 2-day countrywide
polio immunisation campaign on [23 Oct 2007], following reports of a
new case of the disease in Darfur.

No polio cases had been reported in Sudan since August 2005, granting
the country WHO certification as polio-free. The new case, which was
confirmed in a boy from South Darfur, may have spread from
neighbouring Chad, the health agency said.

"Sudan will implement coordinated and cross-border outbreak response
activities as Chad synchronizes its response in the next 2 months,"
Mohamed Abdurrab, WHO representative in Sudan said.

Some villages in Darfur could not reached by vaccinators during a
3-day campaign in August 2007 due to insecurity in the war-torn
region. That campaign also followed reports of polio in Chad.

Officials said more vaccinations would be administered in November [2007].

A highly infectious viral disease, polio invades the nervous system
and can cause total paralysis in a matter of hours.

[According to the most recent update on the polio eradication
website, the date of onset of the above mentioned case in Sudan was
10 Sep 2007. The poliovirus type involved is type-1 (also referred to
as wild poliovirus type 1 or WPV-1; see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>).

The wild poliovirus worldwide update provided information on the
origin of the virus, presumably based on results of genetic typing of
the poliovirus isolate involved. "In Sudan, in response to the recent
confirmation of a polio case in South Darfur (linked to virus
circulating in Chad), NIDs (National Immunization Days) were launched
on 23 Oct 2007. Further NIDs will be conducted in November [2007] in
synchronization with Chad. The activities are part of an urgent and
ongoing outbreak response to minimise the risk of further
international spread, which is compounded by large population
movements across the region during the upcoming Hajj season.
Insecurity in both Sudan and Chad continues to be of major concern to
the quality of outbreak response activities" (see
<http://www.polioeradication.org/casecount.asp#details>).

From the monthly situation report available at
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/current_monthly_sitrep.asp>,
there is the following background information: "In Sudan, the 1st
polio identified in Sudan since June 2005 was confirmed in southern
Darfur in an area close to a known transmission zone in Chad. The
case is a 30-month old child from a nomadic group traveling across
southern Darfur. The detection of 6 cases in Chad this year (2007)
underlines the ongoing threat of re-infection from endemic areas. The
risk of further spread to the east remains high and is further
compounded by large population movements across the region for the
upcoming Hajj season. Sudan has been conducting preventive polio
campaigns since confirmation of polio in Chad earlier this year. An
emergency outbreak response campaign will now be held on 23 Oct 2007
in synchronization with Chad." - Mod.MPP]

In Chad, advance notification of 5 new cases (WPV1s) was received.
The cases are in previously infected areas in the west of the country
bordering Nigeria, and in the east bordering Sudan, and in a
newly-infected area in the south-central part of the country.

In response, Chad is synchronizing immunization activities with
neighbouring countries, notably with Nigeria in the west and with
Sudan in the east.

[According to the polio eradication website, as of 23 Oct 2007 there
have been 6 cases of polio confirmed in Chad, with date of onset of
the most recent WPV-1 isolate on 31 Aug 2007, but as stated above,
there has been advance notification of 5 more recent cases according
to the weekly update. Reviewing the annual case counts reported from
Chad in 2000, there were 4 cases; in 2001 and 2002 there were no
cases reported, and Chad was considered to have interrupted
transmission of WPV in the country. In 2003, there were 25 cases; in
2004 there were 24 cases; in 2005, there were 2 cases; and in 2006,
there was one case reported. All reported cases from 2003 until the
present are considered to be importation related
(<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>).

In DR Congo, advance notification of 2 new cases (WPV1s) was received
from Orientale province. The outbreak in Orientale is continuing to
spread, as one of the 2 new cases is from previously polio-free
Kisangani district, further along the Congo river. Efforts must now
focus on stopping this outbreak once and for all in Orientale. The
next SIAs are planned for [25 Oct 2007].

[According to the polio eradication website, as of 23 Oct 2007, there
have been a total of 32 cases of wild poliovirus-associated paralytic
disease reported from the DR Congo, not including the above mentioned
2 cases of WPV-1 from Orientale province. Historically, in 2000 there
were 28 cases of polio reported; there were no cases reported during
the period 2001 through 2005; and in 2006, there were 13 cases
reported. As with Chad, all cases reported since 2003 have been
considered importation-related (presumably this conclusion is based
upon genetic typing of poliovirus isolates demonstrating their recent
linkage to ongoing poliovirus circulation in other known infected countries
(<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/casecount.pdf>).

More information comes from the monthly situation report of the polio
eradication initiative for September/October 2007, available at
<http://www.polioeradication.org/content/general/current_monthly_sitrep.asp>:
"In 2007, the polio outbreak following a 4th importation is
continuing in Equateur Province and has spread into neighbouring
Orientale Province. 32 cases have been reported this year (2007), the
highest number of cases of all the re-infected countries. Although a
number of SIAs have been conducted throughout the year in the
affected areas, several operational challenges affect the quality of
the campaigns, including availability of petrol for transport and
adequate micro-planning to reach all populations along the Congo
River. Emphasis on upcoming campaigns is to urgently address these
operational issues." - Mod.MPP]
