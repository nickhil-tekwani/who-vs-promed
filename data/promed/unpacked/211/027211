A Rapides Parish teenager has been diagnosed with a rare [strain] of
encephalitis carried by mosquitoes, according to a report filed late
Tuesday [5 Aug 2008] by the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.

The [strain], called the La Crosse virus, was recently discovered in
a 13-year-old currently under treatment for the disease, said state
epidemiologist Dr Raoult Ratard. No further information about the
Rapides teenager is being released by state officials, including the
severity of the infection.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] reports that
there are only about 70 cases of La Crosse virus contractions
annually in the United States.

"We have very few cases of this that are severe in Louisiana,
sometimes it can just be simple meningitis," said Ratard.

According to the CDC, the virus [is] carried by mosquitoes and is
often transferred to humans from the insects biting woodland rodents,
such as squirrels, and then biting people.

Children under 16 are at a higher risk to contract the virus,
especially if they live near a forest, the CDC reports.

While the virus can cause seizures and, in rare cases, cause patients
to slip into comas, the majority of infections are subclinical or
result in mild illness.

Death as a result of the La Crosse virus is rare, the CDC reports.
