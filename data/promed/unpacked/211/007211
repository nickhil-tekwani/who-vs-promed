At least 7 people have died, and 87 others were taken seriously ill in Odisha's Bhadrak district on Tuesday [30 Apr 2019] after allegedly consuming spurious liquor along with meat at a feast organised a day after the 4th and final phase of polls were conducted in the state.

The victims belong to Tihidi and Chandbali blocks of the coastal district, where elections for both Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies were held on Sunday [28 Apr 2019]. Doctors said the condition of the people being treated at 2 hospitals remains critical.

"We received 32 patients with complaints of terrible stomach pain. Two of them were declared dead on arrival. Another died during treatment, while another man was referred to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack," said Dr BK Dash, the chief district medical officer (CDMO) of Bhadrak.

He declined to hold liquor consumption as the sole reason behind the deaths and illness of the patients. "There are several possible factors. There was a heat wave-like situation for the past few days. Besides, consumption of stale meat and liquor are other possible factors. The exact cause will be known after examination of the viscera of the dead people," added Dr Dash.

"After the polls were over, a group of local youths held a feast to rejoice and consumed liquor there. They came back home in the night and slept outside their houses as it was too hot inside. They complained of severe stomach pain and headache in the wee hours and were rushed to hospitals, where 7 of them died," said a local youth on condition of anonymity. It was possible the meat and liquor consumed at the feast was bought by cash given to the people by local politicians to influence the polls, he added.

Bhadrak district collector Gyana Das and Sub-Divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Umakanta Moharana visited the hospitals at Tihidi and Bhadrak to take stock of the situation. The collector has ordered an administrative probe to ascertain the causes of the deaths and sickness. Police and excise department officials began conducting raids to find out where this liquor came from.

"Samples of liquor have been taken from the spot of the feast. A chemical analysis of these samples will be conducted to ascertain if the liquor was spurious," said state excise department secretary Nikunja Bihari Dhal. As per rules, all liquor shops are closed 48 hours before the polls begin.

Meanwhile, the hooch tragedy sparked public protests in the area. Hundreds of people blocked the Bhadrak-Chandabali road for over 2 hours demanding a fast and impartial probe and strong action against people who facilitated the feast and supplied liquor.

[With high heat, people may get dehydrated. Alcohol will not help with symptoms of dehydration. This article hints the meat may have been spoiled, possibly by the heat. So at this point, we have a suggestion of spurious liquor, dehydration, spoiled meat, or a combination of any or all of these.

While we cannot determine from this article whether the meat was spoiled, possibly with bacteria from the heat or unsanitary conditions/preparation, we do know there have been other cases of liquor in India that was questionable.

While illegal alcohol or some mixture thereof occurs from time to time, it seems to be primarily because methanol is used instead of ethanol.

"Methanol toxicity initially lacks severe toxic manifestations. Its pathophysiology represents a classic example of lethal synthesis in which toxic metabolites cause fatality after a characteristic latent period. In other words, these people may not realize they are sick or ill until some time after consumption.

Methanol is sometimes used as an ethanol substitute for alcohol. Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, fruit juices, fermented beverages, and diet soft drinks containing aspartame are the primary sources of methanol in the human body, but [they contain] minute quantities.

Wood alcohol is also known as methanol. It is a commonly used toxic organic solvent causing metabolic acidosis, neurologic issues, and death when ingested. It is a part of many commercial industrial solvents and of adulterated alcoholic beverages or is mistaken as being the same as alcohol for ingestion. Methanol toxicity remains a common problem in many parts of the developing world, especially among members of lower socioeconomic classes.

Neurological complications are recognized more frequently due to advanced technologies and because of early recognition of the toxicity and advances in supportive care. Hemodialysis and better management of acid-base disturbances remain the most important therapeutic improvements.

Serum methanol levels of greater than 20 mg/dL correlate with ocular injury. Fundoscopic changes are notable within only a few hours after methanol ingestion. The mechanism by which the methanol causes toxicity to the visual system is not well understood. Formic acid, the toxic metabolite of methanol, is regarded as being responsible for ocular toxicity, and blindness can occur in humans.

The prognosis in methanol poisoning correlates with the amount of methanol consumed and the subsequent degree of metabolic acidosis; more severe acidosis confers a poorer prognosis. Methanol has a relatively low toxicity. The adverse effects are thought to be from the accumulation of formic acid, a metabolite of methanol metabolism. The prognosis is further dependent on the amount of formic acid that has accumulated in the blood, with a direct correlation existing between the formic acid concentration and morbidity and mortality. Little long-term improvement can be expected in patients with neurologic complications.

The minimal lethal dose of methanol in adults is believed to be 1 mg/kg of body weight. The exact rates of morbidity and mortality from methanol intoxication are not available.

Rapid early treatment is necessary for survival, but sequelae such as blindness may be permanent.

Metabolic acidosis in methanol poisoning may necessitate the administration of bicarbonate and assisted ventilation. Bicarbonate potentially may reverse visual deficits. In addition, bicarbonate may help to decrease the amount of active formic acid.

Antidote therapy, often using ethanol or fomepizole, is directed toward delaying methanol metabolism until the methanol is eliminated from the patient's system either naturally or via dialysis. Like methanol, ethanol is metabolized by ADH, but the enzyme's affinity for ethanol is 10 to 20 times higher than it is for methanol. Fomepizole is also metabolized by ADH; however, its use is limited because of high cost and lack of availability.

Hemodialysis can easily remove methanol and formic acid. Indications for this procedure include (1) greater than 30 mL of methanol ingested, (2) serum methanol level greater than 20 mg/dL, (3) observation of visual complications, and (4) no improvement in acidosis despite repeated sodium bicarbonate infusions.

Intravenous administration of ethanol in a 10% dextrose solution may be helpful. As ethanol prolongs the elimination half-life of methanol, the treatment may take several days, and the patient should be hospitalized. Dialysis may be necessary to prevent kidney failure as well. Hemodialysis remains an effective treatment."
