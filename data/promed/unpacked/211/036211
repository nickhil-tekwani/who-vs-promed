[1] Vaccine storage

Currently available COVID vaccines require cold storage and sophisticated manufacturing capacity, which makes it difficult to produce and distribute them widely, especially in less developed countries. A new type of vaccine would potentially be much easier to produce and would not need refrigeration, report researchers at Boston Children's Hospital in the [2 Nov 2021] issue of PNAS.

The researchers, led by Hidde Ploegh, PhD, and first authors Novalia Pishesha, PhD, and Thibault Harmand, PhD, believe their technology could help fill global vaccination gaps and that the same technology could be applied to vaccines against other diseases.

In mice, the vaccine elicited strong immune responses against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. It was successfully freeze-dried and later reconstituted without loss of efficacy. In tests, it remained stable and potent for at least 7 days at room temperature.

Unlike current COVID-19 vaccines, the new design is completely protein-based, making it easy for many facilities to manufacture. It has 2 components: antibodies derived from alpacas, known as nanobodies, and the portion of the virus's spike protein that binds to receptors on human cells.

The nanobodies are the key part of the vaccine technology. They are specially designed to target antigen-presenting cells, critical cells in the immune system, by homing to class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens on the cells' surface. This brings the business end of the vaccine - in this case, the segment of the spike protein -, directly to the very cells that will "show" it to other immune cells, sparking a broader immune response.

Current COVID-19 vaccines stimulate production of the spike protein at the site in the body where they're injected, and are presumed to stimulate antigen-presenting cells indirectly, says Ploegh. "But taking out the middleman and talking directly to antigen presenting cells is much more efficient," he says. "The secret sauce is the targeting."

In experiments in mice, the vaccine elicited robust humoral immunity against SARS-CoV-2, stimulating high amounts of neutralizing antibodies against the spike protein fragment. It also elicited strong cellular immunity, stimulating the T helper cells that rally other immune defenses.

Because the vaccine is a protein, rather than a messenger RNA like the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, it lends itself much more to large-scale manufacturing.

"We don't need a lot of the fancy technology and expertise that you need to make an mRNA vaccine," says Harmand. "Skilled workers are currently a bottleneck for production of the COVID vaccine, whereas biopharma has a lot of experience producing protein-based therapeutics at scale."

This could potentially enable production of the vaccine at many sites around the world, close to where it would be used. The team has filed a patent on their technology and now hopes to engage biotech or pharmaceutical companies to take their work into further testing and, eventually, a clinical trial.

"It may be that initial application is something else other than COVID-19," says Ploegh. "This study was the proof of concept that our protein-based approach works well."

[Citation. Pishesha, N., Harmand T.J., Paul W. Rothlauf P.W., et al. A class II MHC-targeted vaccine elicits immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants. (2021) PNAS. doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2116147118.

Significance
"Vaccines remain the best hope of curtailing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, morbidity, and mortality. Currently available vaccines require cold storage and sophisticated manufacturing capacity, complicating their distribution, especially in less developed countries. We report a protein-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine that directly and specifically targets antigen-presenting cells. It consists of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor-binding domain (SpikeRBD) fused to a nanobody that recognizes class II major histocompatibility complex antigens (VHHMHCII). Our vaccine elicits robust humoral (high-titer binding and neutralizing antibodies) and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in both young and aged mice. VHHMHCII-SpikeRBD is stable for at least 7 days at room temperature and can be lyophilized without loss of efficacy, desirable attributes for logistical reasons.

Discussion
(...) "Most currently used vaccines are difficult to manufacture and/or require specialized storage conditions. Vaccines with enhanced stability that tolerate lyophilization, such as the protein-based vaccine reported here or a different, nanoparticle-based vaccine, allow stockpiling at ambient temperature (29). This is an important attribute for distribution in countries where access to cold storage and/or effective transportation is a challenge. A unique feature of this vaccine approach is its ability to deliver antigen directly to MHC class II+ cells. Humoral and cellular immunity directed against the SpikeRBD develops within a week of the first dose, unlike mRNA-based vaccines and nontargeting protein-based vaccines, which usually take longer (30)."

[In the past 24 hours, 9 countries including Russia (39 165), the USA (23 165), the UK (30 191), Turkey (25 304), Germany (20 701), Ukraine (17 419), Poland (12 491), India (11 648), and the Netherlands (11 349), reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 4513 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 5 Nov 2021 to late 6 Nov 2021). A total of 45 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 26 of the 45 countries are from the European region, 6 are from the Americas region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 3.8%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 0.26% increase in daily reported cases and 19.9% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 300 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 250.61 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.06 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
