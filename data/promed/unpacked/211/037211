Toxoplasmosis, sheep - Australia (TAS): control: 20050925.2827
-----------------------------------------------
Re: "The main problem for farmers is toxoplasmosis, a disease carried by
many feral cats that can be transferred to livestock through bites and
scratches."
As far as I know, toxoplasmosis can't be transmitted by bites or scratches
from cats. Livestock acquire the parasite in the same way as humans,
through contact with cat feces that contain oocysts.
This doesn't diminish the fact that toxoplasmosis is a problem for
livestock, but in my experience, very few goats, sheep or cows receive
bites and scratches from cats.

[Karin Christensen is correct; the statement in the cited newswire was
erroneous. The definitive hosts (animals in which the organism reproduces
sexually) for _Toxoplasma gondii_ are members of the Felidae family (mainly
domestic cats). Livestock, as all warm-blood animals, are intermediate
hosts, infected by the ingestion of oocysts excreted by the definitive hosts.
In sheep and goats, the main clinical manifestation of toxoplasmosis is
abortion. Humans become infected with _Toxoplasma gondii_ mainly by
ingesting uncooked meat containing viable tissue cysts or by ingesting food
or water contaminated with oocysts from the feces of infected cats.
Children might be exposed to oocysts in cat excrements deposited in
sandpits. Circumstantial evidence suggests that oocyst-induced infections
in humans are clinically more severe than tissue cyst-acquired infections.
