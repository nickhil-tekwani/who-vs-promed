Spanish Flu 1918-1919 and the island of New Guinea
-----------------------------------------------------
The case of Papua New Guinea is interesting, as accounts seem to be
contradictory. Official versions imply successful quarantine in the case
of the eastern half of the island, in contrast to the western half (then
Dutch New Guinea, now Irian Jaya), where the south coast (Marind
area) was apparently devastated (Overweel, 1993, citing Van Baal,
1939: thanks to Garrick Hitchcock for this reference). Thus, for the
then Territory of New Guinea (recently captured by Australia from
Germany):
"..all ships bound for the Territory of New Guinea from Australian ports
were subjected, before being permitted to depart, to a period of
quarantine on the Australian coast, and were again inspected on
arrrival in New Guinea.
In this way was avoided a repetition of the tragedy of Samoa, where the
arrival of a ship with influenza aboard caused the death of many
thousands of natives." (MacKenzie, 1934: 217-218)
In Papua also, according to some accounts, the flu was prevented from
entering by official quarantine measures (Black, 1957; Strong, 1932;
Scragg, 1971).
However, contrary to such accounts, there is evidence suggesting that
the epidemic may have effected populations on at least the southwest coast
of Papua (Western and Gulf Provinces: Hope 1979; Rickwood 1992;
Weymouth 1978; Williams 1937) spreading in from then Dutch New
Guinea, and perhaps reaching as far inland as the Great Papuan
Plateau (Schieffelin, 1991). There are, however, problems with dating
some of these Papuan accounts, which appear to include outbreaks as
late as 1921. To the north in New Guinea, there are also cursory
descriptions from several areas of what may have been the 1918-19 flu
(but again there are dating problems), including Peri village on the
south coast of Manus island (Mead, 1934), the island of New Ireland
(Chinnery, 1930), and the Snake River Valley in inland Morobe on the
mainland of New Guinea (Girard, 1955/56).
In short, the jury appears to be still out as to how effectively the
eastern half of New Guinea was quarantined in 1918-1919.
