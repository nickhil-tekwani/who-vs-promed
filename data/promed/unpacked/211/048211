Official documents show bird flu in Libyan farms
------------------------------------------------
Although Libyan authorities repeatedly denied the presence of the bird flu
virus on Libyan soil, Libyan media sources on Friday [9 Dec 2005] disclosed
that they have a copy of documents which prove that the Libyan security
ministry and senior officials of the Inspection and Control Department were
aware and admitted to the Libyan prime minister, Dr Shukri Ghanim, that the
bird flu virus is widespread in a number of Libyan poultry farms in the
Benghazi region (north east Libya).
"Information reaching us has shown that the Benghazi division of the
anti-poultry diseases committee has conducted routine checks on the poultry
farms in the area, took and thoroughly scrutinized blood samples taken from
those farms. They later sent them on 9 Oct 2005 to a special laboratory in
the United Kingdom for another lab test. The result, which came by fax,
confirmed that all the samples are positive. This shows the prevalence of
the bird flu virus in the eastern part of the country," the Libyan security
minister, Nasr Al Mabrouk, said in a letter to the prime minister. A copy
of the result was attached to the letter. Al Mabrouk complained bitterly
against the agriculture ministry, which he accused of doing nothing to
stave off the disease from entering the country, while chicken and live
birds continue to be sold on the market with no concern.
According to Libya Today electronic newspaper, which got the document
without disclosing the source, there is total chaos and panic over the way
the Libyan authorities handled this dangerous dossier.

[There is an apocryphal saying about ProMED-mail: "It is better to report
an outbreak, because otherwise, you will read about it on ProMED." But we
need clarification as to which avian flu virus this is. H9N2 is enzootic in
the region. From the wording, the anti-poultry diseases committee had sent
surveillance poultry blood or sera to Weybridge for analysis. They may have
noted antibodies to H9N2 but not to H5N1. Would anyone with hard
information please clarify the situation? - Mod.MHJ]
