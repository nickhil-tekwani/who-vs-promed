As of Fri 8 Dec 2000, the Ugandan Ministry of Health has reported the
following new laboratory-confirmed cases by district as follows.
In Gulu district, there have been 6 new laboratory-confirmed cases and 2
deaths. The current cumulative figures for Gulu are now 376 cases and 142
deaths.

figures for Masindi are 24 cases and 14 deaths.
In Mbarara, no new cases or deaths have been reported.
The cumulative figures for all affected districts in the country are 405
cases and 160 deaths [see note below.
Since mid-October, partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and Response
Network coordinated by WHO have been responding to the Ebola fever outbreak
in Gulu, Masindi and Mbarara districts. While the international response to
the outbreak has progressed beyond the initial acute phase, there is
continued need for intensive measures to control and contain the outbreak.
The situation in Masindi requires particular attention and the Ugandan
Ministry of Health has appealed for volunteers to assist in the following
areas: disease surveillance and control tracing; transportation of the
dead; social mobilization; infection control; clinical care of patients.
WHO and its partners have mobilized international staff to support this effort.
