Officials in northern Iraq said on Tuesday [Tue 31 Jan 2006] that
they were treating 12 patients suspected of having [contracted avian
influenza] as a World Health Organisation (WHO) team prepared to
travel to the area to give urgent assistance.
Iraq's Health Minister said on Monday [30 Jan 2006] that the country
may have its first human bird flu victim after preliminary test
results showed that a 14-year-old Iraqi girl who died 2 weeks ago had
the H5N1 virus. WHO said it was urgently seeking further tests at a
British laboratory to confirm the diagnosis and was dispatching a
team of experts to help local health officials in Iraq's largely
autonomous northern region of Kurdistan. The British laboratory will
also assess samples from the girl's uncle, who had cared for her when
she was ill, and who himself died last week of a respiratory infection.
"We have 12 patients in Sulaimaniya who have lung infections that we
suspect may be [caused by the [H5N1] bird flu virus," Kurdistan's
Deputy Prime Minister, Imad Ahmed, told Reuters, referring to one of
the region's largest cities. The most serious was a 54-year-old woman
who came from the same village as the dead girl and is believed to be
a distant relative of the victim. The village is close to Iraq's
border with Turkey, where 4 children died from avian influenza in
recent weeks. The head of a Kurdistan committee set up to fight bird
flu said all birds [poultry?] in areas around Sulaimaniya were being
culled. "They number in the region of 500 000," Tahsin Namiq said.
The WHO team, composed of 4 experts in epidemiology and infection
control, will leave on Wednesday [1 Feb 2006] for Jordan and should
reach northern Iraq by the end of the week, WHO spokesman Dick
Thompson told Reuters. "The purpose of the mission is to assess the
situation on the ground. Experts from the (U.N.) Food and Agriculture
Organisation may also be joining the team," he added.
So far there have been no confirmed cases among poultry in Iraq, but
local officials say the country's porous frontiers, a raging
insurgency, and general chaos in the aftermath of the U.S.-led
invasion will make it hard to control any epidemic. The virulent
virus has killed at least 85 people since late 2003, mainly in 5
Asian countries where the virus emerged. Initially, the WHO had
discounted the virus as the cause of the death of the Iraqi girl, but
a WHO official said on Monday that preliminary results from a U.S.
Navy laboratory in Cairo [detected] the H5N1 virus. "We don't have
positive confirmation of H5N1 in the girl yet. The laboratory samples
should have reached the UK this morning," Thompson said.
The girl had a history of exposure to diseased birds, WHO said on its
website. The WHO said Iraq was the 7th country to report human H5N1
infection in the current outbreak. The 1st human case occurred in
Viet Nam in December 2003.

The number of people infected with H5N1 avian influenza [in the
current] outbreak in Turkey may be only 12 rather than the 21
reported by local authorities, the World Health Organisation (WHO)
said on Tuesday. Tests on samples from Turkish patients, analysed
over the past few weeks at a WHO collaborating laboratory in London,
confirm only 12 cases of the deadly H5N1 virus, with the other
results negative so far.
The information indicating a smaller case load in Turkey would also
mean that the 4 bird flu deaths -- now confirmed by laboratories in
both Ankara and London -- would translate into a 33 percent mortality
rate. This would be closer to death rates from the disease seen in
Asia. In all, the virus has killed at least 85 people among 160 known
cases since late 2003, according to the WHO. "[Work is continuing] on
on the other 9 samples, but the preliminary results from the
collaborating centre in London suggest that those are not H5N1", WHO
spokesman Iain Simpson told journalists. Laboratory work to
[determine] the [genome sequences of the viruses] found in Turkey was
continuing, Simpson said. This was important for monitoring any
changes in the deadly virus and how it is transmitted.
Victims usually contract avian influenza through direct exposure to
diseased or dead poultry. Turkey has culled around 1.3 million birds
in an effort to contain the virus.

[It has been suggested that the disease situation in Iraq is
exceptional in that suspected human cases have been reported in the
absence of prior reports of disease in poultry. However, the
evidence for this is contradictory. A previous article on the Iraq
situation states both that: "There have been no confirmed cases of
[bird flu] in Iraq," and then later that: "The girl had a history of
exposure to diseased birds".
Elsewhere (in a Canadian Press article by Helen Brancewell, it is
reported that: "The avian influenza-infected girl died after
developing severe pneumonia in the Kurdistan village of Raniya, about
100 kilometres south of the Turkish border and just 24 kilometres
west of the border with Iran. She had an aortic aneurysm and a
history of cardiac problems. The girl's mother rejected the bird flu
diagnosis, but acknowledged that a number of her chickens had
mysteriously died before her daughter's death.
