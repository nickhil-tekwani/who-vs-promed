On 19 Feb 2015, Germany reported 3 cases of fatal encephalitis in residents of the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The 1st clinical case was seen in 2011, the 2nd and the 3rd in 2013 in different hospitals. Affected persons were males aged 62-72 years and of age-typical health status.

Each of them was known to breed variegated squirrels (_Sciurus variegatoides_), a type of tree squirrel common to Central America that can be kept as an exotic outside pet. The 3 breeders knew each other but did not live in close proximity to one another. It is unclear whether they exchanged animals. During the prodromal phase, which lasted for 2 weeks or longer, the patients presented with fever and shivering, fatigue, weakness and walking difficulties. Due to increased confusion and psychomotor impairment they were admitted to neurology wards where they developed ocular paresis.

They rapidly deteriorated within a few days and died after some time in intensive care, despite mechanical ventilation. Investigations for usual (non-purulent) encephalitis aetiologies performed at the Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine in Hamburg did not initially find evidence of known pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid and samples of brain tissue of the deceased. Genetic analysis (metagenomics) of the brain tissue of the 3rd patient's squirrel that appeared healthy but died during general anaesthesia produced sequences of a newly identified type of Borna virus. Further molecular and immunohistological analysis of brain tissue from the 3 deceased patients confirmed presence of this virus in the human cases as well. The newly identified virus is different from currently known Borna viruses. In limited testing of additional variegated squirrels, no other animal was found to be positive for this infection. Further tests are ongoing.

ECDC assessment
----------
A recently reported cluster of acute fatal encephalitis in 3 squirrel breeders possibly related to an infection with a newly identified bornavirus is an unusual event. The novel nature of this event requires that additional investigations be undertaken into the role of a new bornavirus in the aetiology of these cases, the identification of natural hosts, reservoir and the transmission route. Nevertheless, pending the completion of the cluster investigation, it is advised that feeding or direct contact with living or dead variegated squirrels should be avoided, as a precautionary measure.

Further investigations are ongoing to characterise these cases. In addition, testing of cases of human encephalitis for this newly identified bornavirus, especially in areas where the presence of bornavirus is documented in animals, can contribute to a better understanding of the risk of bornavirus infection in humans.

Actions
Germany is investigating tissue and cerebrospinal fluid collections from biobanks for further cases. Previously cryptic cases of encephalitis are being re-evaluated in view of the new virus. Breeders/owners of variegated squirrels will be questioned as to their health and anecdotal knowledge of further potentially lethal cases among other breeders/owners. Breeders are asked to send in deceased animals to the Friedrich Loeffler Institute. ECDC published a rapid risk assessment on 26 Feb 2015 http://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/new-bornavirus-strain-detected-EU-rapid-risk-assessment.pdf

[Borna virus causes disease in a variety of vertebrates, most noteworthy "sad horse" disease and proventricular dilatation in psittacine birds. Neurological disease from Borna virus infection has been associated with psychiatric/neurologic disorders in humans (see the review cited in ProMED-mail archive no.19970610.1227), including the 3 cases discussed above with documented presence of a new type of Borna virus.

Mod.CP previously commented (ProMED-mail archive no. 20080813.2510), "The virus family _Bornaviridae_ comprises a single genus _Borna
virus_ containing a single species _Borna disease virus_ (see: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/01.081.htm for a
description of the genus). According to the ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) Borna virus has a wide host range,
but its natural reservoir has not been determined. Despite its wide host range and phenotypic variation, molecular epidemiological data
have revealed considerable sequence conservation. Uniquely among negative stranded RNA viruses, replication and transcription take
place in the cell nucleus. Borna virus is probably distributed worldwide."

It will be interesting to see a comparison of the new Borna virus genome with that of other isolates.
