Pentagon orders anthrax vaccinations for Gulf troops
Defense Secretary William Cohen has decided that the 36,000 U.S. troops in
the Persian Gulf should undergo anthrax vaccinations as a "prudent action,"
the Pentagon announced Tuesday. The decision to vaccinate all the 1.4
million military men and women in uniform was made in December, but the
program wasn't expected to go into practice until this summer. But with the
crisis in Iraq, the vaccination campaign will begin this month with the
forces now in the Gulf region.

The immunization program will consist of a series of six inoculations for
each service member over an 18-month period, followed by an annual booster.
Although protection levels increase as the shots in the series are given,
the entire six-shot series is required for full protection, as determined by
the FDA, the Pentagon statement said.

Britain, which has stood solidly behind Washington's stand against Iraq, was
also announcing its vaccination program Tuesday. Canada has already
announced its intention to vaccinate its forces in the Gulf region, the
statement said. It will be the responsibility of other nations who may be
contributing to the Gulf effort to decide whether they will embark on such a
program. Iraq, Russia and as many as 10 other countries are believed to have
the capability to use anthrax in weapons. The Pentagon considers it the
easiest biological weapon to make and use, and the most lethal as well.
