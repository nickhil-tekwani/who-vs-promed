We consider frogs as a sensitive bio-indicator of the health (or lack
thereof) of the environment. Recently the Times reported on a recent
Science article by Sessions, SK, on the possibility that the fluke_
Ribeiriola_ (species not mentioned) may be responsible for the
deformities in frogs being reported worldwide. Sessions has studied
this phenomenon for over ten years, and his experimental work with
frogs and various schistosome-like flukes found in the U.S. is exciting.
However, his knowledge of frog embrology and mutagenesis cannot be
expected to include parasitology, malacology and zoology, i.e. the
knowledge of U.S. (much less world-wide) distribution of zoonotic
animal trematodes, their intermediate snail hosts and the definitive
avian and mammalian hosts. But we think he's close to "solving" the
problem.
The challenge is identifying the definitive host(s) for_ Ribeiroia_
species, which apparently can cause damage to frog limb growth plates.
Can ayone suggest the names of knowledgeable trematologists and
malacologists who might add to our limited bank of knowledge
regarding "swimmers itch" cercariae, and the known definitive water
fowl and mammalian hosts? In 1995 Ken Mott [WHO, deceased told us
that swimmers itch was a major problem in Russia and Eastern Europe.
The same phenomenon that may be causing an absolute increase in
this global problem may also be the same for deformed frogs -- and
would explain their also being found in "pristine" bodies of water that
could not have been contaminated with man-made chemicals or
pesticides.
In reviewing some of the lesser known fluke infestations, we
discovered that cercariae of the giant liver fluke (_Fascioloides magna_)
of elk require "non-alkaline" fresh water. If this is true of other
non-tropical flukes, might acid rain be acting as a promoter of
non-human flukes?
We need to access an up-to-date knowledge base on non-human
digenetic trematodes. Our parasite/zoonoses texts are worthless; WHO
Bulletins/Epi carry no reports on them; Lexus Nexus has some
international reports (Germany), but not much else...
