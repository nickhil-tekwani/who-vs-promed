A potentially fatal virus disease affecting horses has been detected
in the valley. Veterinarian Tom Vogel had been called in to test a
horse headed to Vancouver Island last week. The horse tested positive
for Equine Infectious Anemia, otherwise known as Swamp Fever [A very
old name for this disease. It is transmitted by biting flies and
mosquitoes, and so there were probably higher rates of transmission
in swamps. Equine Infectious Anemia is often referred to as EIA. -
Mod.PC]
The virus poses no threat to human health, but is often fatal in
horses. The disease is often said to be like Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV) in horses. [The EIA virus is a slow-acting virus of the
lenti-retrovirus group. Retroviruses cause leukemia in cats, mice,
and cattle; arthritis, pneumonia, and neurologic diseases in small
ruminants; and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) in humans,
hence the common reference to human AIDS. - Mod.PC]
"Sometimes you see very acute symptoms -- fever, anorexia, depression, muscle
weakness, wasting, severe anemia -- and the animal will die. Other times
you'll see animals that will carry this virus for a long period of time and
not show any symptoms," said Vogel. Vogel confirmed that a federal
veterinarian visited the site and quarantined a number of herds. There are a
significant number of animals in quarantine in McBride and in Crescent Spur,
he said. "One of the farms currently under quarantine belongs to Phillip
Marsh in McBride. He said that the affected horse had been boarding at his
residence for some time. There was a horse that had swamp fever, but it
wasn't here at the time, he said. Marsh owns his horses and boards horses for
others."
Equine infectious anemia is a reportable disease under the Health of Animals
Act. [EIA is an OIE list B disease; these are considered to be of socio-
economic and/or public health importance, are significant in the
international trade of animals and animal products, but do not have the same
potential for particularly rapid spread and serious animal or public health
consequences as List A diseases. - Mod.PC]
All suspected cases must be reported to the CFIA and require
immediate investigation by agency inspectors. If an animal tests
positive, the premises are quarantined and all horses that have been
in contact with the infected animal in the past 30 days are tested.
Horses testing positive must be destroyed or permanently isolated.
Owners receive compensation for horses destroyed.
This is not the 1st time the valley has had an outbreak of the
disease. Vogel recalls incidents going back to the late 70s. "More
recently we had a problem in the late 90s, which was mainly
concentrated in the Crescent Spur area," he said. Vogel said testing
has proven to be a very effective control measure. "During these
periods in the late 90s if we hadn't done the test, we would have had
some significant spread of the disease," he said. Vogel does a lot of
testing of horses that are being sold or are going to shows that
require testing. This is the 1st case he has seen in recent years.
"Horse owners disagree on what should be done about the disease. Many
people would like to see universal testing, something they believe
would eliminate the disease altogether, while others don't want to
see that happen."

[Robson Valley is in East Central British Columbia. The Coggins test
for EIA made Leroy Coggins famous after he developed it in 1970,
something I am happy about because he gave me my 1st job after
graduate school.
Testing represents a "tragedy of the commons" situation, as the
animal can be healthy but be an inapparent carrier, the 1st sign of
which is a positive test. Since many positive animals appear healthy,
individual owners are reluctant to test their animals for fear of a
positive test and euthanasia, since no treatment is effective. If
these carrier animals are not tested or at least quarantined in an
insect-proof enclosure for life, they will transmit the disease after
being bit by biting flies or mosquitoes. Testing is best for the
population and the only way to rid a geographic area of the disease,
but is not favored by owners, who fear the loss of their apparently
-- but not truly -- healthy animals. - Mod.PC]
