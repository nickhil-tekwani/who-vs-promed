INSECT VECTOR RISK ASSESSMENT DATABASE - REQUEST FOR INFO
*********************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Tetreault, Gary E., LCDr <dvj0get@jax10.med.navy.mil>

I am a Navy Medical Entomologist who prepares what we call Vector Risk
Assessment Profiles(VECTRAPS) which contain information on arthropod-borne
diseases in foreign countries where our troops deploy. We distribute them
to operational forces to make them aware of the risks of these diseases
prior to them arriving incountry. What I
have been searching for and so far cannot find to improve our product are
databases which contain country specific information on vector species
bionomics as well as information on possible or confirmed insecticide
resistance. Does anyone have any information on this topic? Thanks in
advance for any help you can provide.
