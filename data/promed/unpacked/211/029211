[The United States Animal Health Association's Gray Book on Foreign
Animal Disease
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/emergency_response/downloads/nahems/fad.pdf>
describes sheep and goat pox along with Lumpy Skin Disease in the
group of Capripoxviruses.

It is described as "systemic pox diseases of sheep and goats
characterized by fever, macules developing into papules and necrotic
lesions in the skin and nodular lesions in internal organs secondary
lesions and death in susceptible stock. The disease in sheep and
goats are caused by strains of capripoxvirus which are
indistinguishable serologically...".

The disease is less severe in endemic areas but can cause death in
newly introduced stock. The disease is not zoonotic but can be a real
obstacle to efficient and economically viable production.
Differential diagnoses include bluetongue, PPR or Kata, contagious
ecythema, photosensitisation, insect bites, parasitic pneumonia, and
mange. - Mod.PC]
