Arctic, in 1st reference at end]

Further comments on evidence for West Nile virus exposure of birds in
the arctic
---------------------------------------
I highly doubt that the arctic could be a major source of bird
infection or transmission for West Nile Virus (WNV) in light of the
following factors:
(1) Although in Alaska we have a total of 4 mosquito species that
have been implicated in some way with the possible transmission of
WNV (_Culex tarsalis_, plus 2 _Ochlerotatus_ and one _Culiseta_
species), most apparently tested positive for WNV but have not
necessarily been proven to be competent vectors for the disease.
_Culex tarsalis_, as mentioned in previous posting, is predominantly
a reptilian and/or amphibian feeder that feeds on mammals rather than
birds as a facultative host, and as such should not be a major factor
in WNV transmission at high northern latitudes.
(2) All 35 or so of our described mosquito species in Alaska for
which the life history is known have single annual breeding
capabilities due to the very short summer breeding season. It should
be very difficult to amplify the disease in arctic regions through
multiple bird-mosquito-bird transmissions because of this.
(3) The worst-case scenario would be that overwintering mosquito
species in arctic latitudes would pick up WNV 1st thing in the spring
from migrating birds and deliver it to other birds, and the
amplification would continue through summer mosquito species. 2 of 4
WNV-implicated mosquito species are active during the spring season,
while 2 are summer species. The ranges of these species do not
overlap very well in most places, especially in the arctic.
Nonetheless, given the way the disease has spread westward within
North America, we can no longer say that we in Alaska are entirely
immune from possible invasion by WNV.
It would be interesting to learn whether WNV can overwinter within
the salivary glands of mosquitoes in arctic climates. That might
complicate things, but even so, I very much doubt whether WNV is --
or will ever be -- significantly propagated in arctic latitudes in
North America.

[Before joining the Forest Service, Dr. Kruze was Curator of
Entomology at the University of Alaska Museum.
Although _Culex tarsalis_ does rarely feed on reptiles and
amphibians, it feeds predominantly on birds and mammals (W.K. Reisen
and W.C. Reeves 1990, Bionomics and Ecology of _Culex tarsalis_ and
other potential mosquito vector species, pp. 254-329 In "Epidemiology
and Control of Mosquito-borne Arboviruses in California, 1943-1947",
editor W.C. Reeves, Californian Mosquito and Vector Control
Association, Sacramento, CA). _Culex territans_, however, is the
mosquito referred to in the comment in the previous post that feeds
predominantly on reptiles and birds and rarely on mammals.
All mosquitoes overwinter, either in the egg, larval or adult state.
As Dr Kruse says, overwintering adult females might become infected
in the spring by feeding on infected birds West Nile virus can
overwinter in the salivary glands of mosquitoes in New York, but I do
not know whether there is evidence of viral infection persisting in
arctic mosquitoes.
A more general comments is that a few species of _Culex_ do occur in
the arctic region, though most arctic species belong to the genus
_Ochlerotatus_; for example _Oc. impiger_ and _Oc. nigripes_ are
very common in the arctic and both species occur in Alaska.
Since West Nile virus is a recent introduction in North America, it
seems surprising that about 60 North American mosquito species
belonging to 11 genera seem capable of transmitting the virus (In
Saskatchewan _Cx. tarsalis_ was the main vector of WN). It would seem
therefore that Alaska could have potential vectors of WNV, although
of course their behaviour and ecology may preclude them as vectors.
For example, some species are autogenous -- that is, they can develop
and lay their 1st batch of eggs without a blood-meal. This would
reduce the chances of transmission by such species. Furthermore a few
species such as _Oc. churchillensis_ and _Oc. rempeli_, both common
and widely distributed in the arctic, including Alaska, never
blood-feed and produce all their eggs autogenously.
Another constraint is that, as I understand it, WNV viremia in birds
lasts less than a week, so a potential vector must bite the bird
during this relatively short time interval to become infected.
I understand there is considerable debate in Alaska among experts on
the likelihood of West Nile virus being recorded there, and if so
whether it is likely to persist. - Mod.MS]
