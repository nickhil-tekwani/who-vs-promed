Suspect canker found on 3rd QLD property
---------------------------------------------
The Department of Primary Industries (DPI) is investigating the discovery
of a possible citrus canker (CC) finding on a 3rd Emerald property in
Queensland's central highlands. Samples of suspect material have been taken
for testing. Almost 600 000 trees have been destroyed on 2 farms since
canker was discovered last year [2004].
The latest possible infection comes just after Queensland's Primary
Industries Minister, Henry Palaszczuk, announced more assistance for
growers affected by the disease.
An Emerald citrus grower says he is shattered about a suspected CC outbreak
on his property. The DPI has taken away 4 samples for testing from his
property. If confirmed, it would be the 3rd property infected by CC, after
5 earlier outbreaks on Evergreen and 2PH Farms.

[In an update on 30 May 2004, CC has now been confirmed on a 3rd Queensland
property within the Emerald Pest Quarantine Area (PQA). All 7500 citrus
trees will be removed from the commercial orchard, and, as an added
precaution, all native citrus host plants will be destroyed in a buffer
zone around the property. The National Management Group (NMG) will consider
future eradication strategies for CC when it next meets in the coming
weeks. Strict product movement and containment measures are in place for
the PQA.
