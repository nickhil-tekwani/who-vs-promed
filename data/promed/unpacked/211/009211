Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 - update 110
---------------------------------
Weekly update
-------------
As of 18 Jul 2010, worldwide more than 214 countries and overseas
territories or communities have reported laboratory confirmed cases
of pandemic influenza H1N1 2009, including more than 18 366 deaths.

The WHO is actively monitoring the progress of the pandemic through
frequent consultations with the WHO Regional Offices and member
states and through monitoring of multiple sources of information.

Situation update:
-----------------
Globally pandemic influenza activity remains low. The most active
areas of influenza transmission remained in the tropical zones;
primarily in West Africa, Central America, the Caribbean, and South
and Southeast Asia, although activity is localized to relatively
small areas in each region. In the temperate zone of the southern
hemisphere, Australia and New Zealand have showed signs of increased
respiratory disease in recent weeks. Both countries have continued to
detect low levels of predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. In
South Africa, the influenza season is well under way and is
predominantly associated with seasonal influenza B and H3N2 viruses
and small numbers of pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses.

In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere, overall influenza
activity remained low but with notable increases in recent weeks in
some areas. South Africa had been experiencing a sharp increase in
the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive for influenza
viruses since late June 2010. For the current reporting week, 30-40
percent of sentinel respiratory samples from patients with severe
acute respiratory infections (SARI)/influenza-like-illness (ILI)
tested positive for influenza. Respiratory disease activity was
associated primarily with seasonal influenza B and H3N2 viruses, with
a much smaller number of pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses.

Australia has reported a gradual increase in the number of
respiratory disease consultations due to ILI since end of June to
early July 2010 although this similar to the levels experienced in
2008. This increase of respiratory disease activity may be accounted
for in part by circulation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).
Influenza viruses in Australia have been about 2/3 pandemic H1N1
influenza and 1/3 seasonal influenza H3N2. In New Zealand, rates of
ILI have markedly increased compared to the previous reporting week
but still remained below the seasonal baseline, primarily associated
with pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. In Chile and Argentina, national
rates of ILI remained low relative to last year at the same period of
time.

In Asia, overall pandemic influenza activity remained low. The most
active areas of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus transmission are in
India, Cambodia and Singapore. Significant transmission of pandemic
H1N1 influenza is occurring in the Southern states of Kerala and the
Western state of Maharashtra, India. Cambodia has recently observed
an increase in the proportion of respiratory samples testing positive
for influenza virus (primarily pandemic H1N1 influenza and seasonal
influenza H3N2) since early June 2010. In Singapore, rates of ILI and
acute respiratory infections (ARI) increased compared to previous
week and reached the epidemic threshold. The proportion of patients
with ILI testing positive for pandemic H1N1 influenza continues to be
stable (15 percent) associated with co-circulation of pandemic H1N1
influenza, seasonal influenza H3N2, and influenza type B viruses.

In sub-Saharan Africa, the current situation was largely unchanged
since the last update. Pandemic H1N1 and seasonal influenza activity
continued to be observed in several countries. Ghana has had a
sustained circulation of pandemic H1N1 influenza virus since June
2010. Small numbers of seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses continued to
be detected in eastern Africa.

In the tropical regions of the Americas, the situation has remained
similar to the previous week. Overall pandemic and seasonal influenza
activity were low, except in pockets of Central and South America
with co-circulation of pandemic and seasonal influenza H3N2 viruses
(Costa Rica had predominantly pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, while
Nicaragua and Panama had predominantly influenza H3N2 virus).

In the temperate regions of the Northern hemisphere, pandemic and
seasonal influenza viruses have been detected only sporadically or at
very low levels during the past month. (Countries in temperate
regions are defined as those north of the Tropic of Cancer or south
of the Tropic of Capricorn, while countries in tropical regions are
defined as those between these 2 latitudes.)

Description: Displayed data reflect the most recent data reported to
FluNet (<http://gamapserver.who.int/GlobalAtlas/home.asp>), WHO
regional offices or on Ministry of health websites in the last 2
weeks. The percent of specimens tested positive for influenza
includes all specimens tested positive for seasonal or pandemic
influenza. The pie charts show the distribution of virus subtypes
among all specimens that were tested positive for influenza. The
available country data were joined in larger geographical areas with
similar influenza transmission patterns to be able to give an
overview
(<http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/transmission_zones/en>).

The qualitative indicators monitor: the global geographic spread of
influenza, trends in acute respiratory diseases, the intensity of
respiratory disease activity, and the impact of the pandemic on
health- care services.
