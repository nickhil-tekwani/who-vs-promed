----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary
-------
Background: The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health and employment after hospitalisation with acute disease is not well understood. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of COVID-19-related hospitalisation on health and employment, to identify factors associated with recovery, and to describe recovery phenotypes.

Methods: The Post-hospitalisation COVID-19 study (PHOSP-COVID) is a multicentre, long-term follow-up study of adults (aged 18 years or older) discharged from hospital in the UK with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, involving an assessment between 2 and 7 months after discharge, including detailed recording of symptoms, and physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was done for the primary outcome of patient-perceived recovery, with age, sex, ethnicity, body-mass index, comorbidities, and severity of acute illness as covariates. A post-hoc cluster analysis of outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognitive impairment, and physical performance was done using the clustering large applications k-medoids approach. The study is registered on the ISRCTN Registry (ISRCTN10980107).

Findings: We report findings for 1077 patients discharged from hospital between 5 Mar and 30 Nov 2020 who underwent assessment at a median of 5.9 months (IQR 4.9-6.5) after discharge. Participants had a mean age of 58 years (SD 13); 384 (36%) were female, 710 (69%) were of White ethnicity, 288 (27%) had received mechanical ventilation, and 540 (50%) had at least 2 comorbidities. At follow-up, only 239 (29%) of 830 participants felt fully recovered, 158 (20%) of 806 had a new disability (assessed by the Washington Group Short Set on Functioning), and 124 (19%) of 641 experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with not recovering were female sex, middle age (40-59 years), 2 or more comorbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial but only weakly associated with the severity of acute illness. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment (n = 767): very severe (131 patients, 17%), severe (159, 21%), moderate along with cognitive impairment (127, 17%), and mild (350, 46%). Of the outcomes used in the cluster analysis, all were closely related except for cognitive impairment. Three (3%) of 113 patients in the very severe cluster, 9 (7%) of 129 in the severe cluster, 36 (36%) of 99 in the moderate cluster, and 114 (43%) of 267 in the mild cluster reported feeling fully recovered. Persistently elevated serum C-reactive protein was positively associated with cluster severity.

Interpretation: We identified factors related to not recovering after hospital admission with COVID-19 at 6 months after discharge (for example, female sex, middle age, 2 or more comorbidities, and more acute severe illness), and 4 different recovery phenotypes. The severity of physical and mental health impairments was closely related, whereas cognitive health impairments were independent. In clinical care, a proactive approach is needed across the acute severity spectrum, with interdisciplinary working, wide access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services, and the potential to stratify care.

Discussion
----------
In conclusion, the majority of survivors of a hospital admission with COVID-19 are not fully recovered at 5 months and have a substantial and diverse physical and mental health burden and negative effects on employment. We identified key factors associated with recovery and 4 distinct recovery phenotypes using cluster analysis according to mental, cognitive, and physical health. Our findings support the need for a proactive approach to clinical follow-up, with a holistic assessment to include symptoms of mental and physical health, and validated assessment of cognitive impairment. The 4 severity clusters highlight the potential to stratify care and the need for wide access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services, including mental health, memory and cognition, and rehabilitation services.

Implications of all the available evidence
------------------------------------------
Our findings suggest that there are underlying mechanisms causing severe mental and physical impairments, independent of the degree of acute lung injury and potentially related to persisting systemic inflammation. Our data, along with previous reports, suggest that a proactive approach and holistic clinical care are needed owing to the large burden of health impairments. The 4 clusters [see above] highlight the potential to stratify and personalise care and emphasise the need for wide access to interventions to improve mental, physical, and cognitive health.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

As health care improves, the concept of surviving well has become increasingly important. This is certainly the case in critical care, in which survivorship has been coined the defining challenge of the 21st century. Within this setting, the field now grapples with the onslaught of the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial objective globally was to manage system strain to enhance equity of provision of care. Acute services expanded care provision by increasing acute care bed numbers and stretching existing resources. For a brief period of time, the world focused only on patient survival. Consistent with the additional survivorship focus in critical care over the past 20 years, the recognition of prolonged disability in survivors of COVID-19 has stimulated a drive to understand the nature of impairments and their effects on mental and physical health, as well as return to societal roles.

In The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Rachael Evans and colleagues of the PHOSP-COVID Collaborative Group present the 1st analyses of a UK multicentre cohort study of survivorship of hospitalised patients with COVID-19. Of the 1077 patients assessed at a median of 5.9 months (IQR 4.9-6.5) after hospitalisation with COVID-19, 20% developed a new disability, 19% experienced a health-related change in occupation, and 71% described themselves as not having fully recovered. Patients described a median of 9 different symptoms covering physical and mental domains, which were mirrored in both patient-reported outcome measures and in objective physical assessments.

The findings from these high-quality data are a cause for concern. A substantial proportion of the working-age population is likely to have long-term, life-changing sequelae after COVID-19, with physical, mental, social, and fiscal effects. The good news is that the PHOSP-COVID data confirm that we have an existing prism through which to view this public health issue, with mature domains to guide research and policy: that of post-intensive care syndrome. We can view acquired disability in domains (rather than symptoms), each of which can be screened for (e.g., using the Post-ICU Presentation Screen) at hospital discharge.

Moving forward, it will be important to use such a framework not only to capture symptomatology, but also to map symptoms to domains that could guide holistic rehabilitation and recovery interventions. Using these systematic approaches will ensure that no domains that might be affected are missed; for example, poor nutrition, dysphonia, and dysphagia are all reported in survivors of COVID-19 but are not reported by the PHOSP-COVID group. The long-term sequelae of COVID-19 -- similar to the persistent effects of critical illness -- are unrelated to the acute diagnosis per se. Instead of developing new interventions, translation of interventions from other disease modalities offers hope for future patients, if resources are appropriately allocated.

We urgently need to build on the plethora of descriptive cohort studies examining COVID-19 sequelae with large, powered trials that examine the efficacy of individualised management options, such as pharmacological interventions, multidisciplinary inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation, or the role of targeted follow-up clinics. As with the trajectory of research over the past 2 decades in critical care, we need to identify responders to specific interventions, map impairments across time, and involve patients and caregivers in the process of recovery.

[2] Adolescent COVID
Date: Fri 8 Oct 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/adolescent-covid-19-vaccinations-lag-across-us


Only 47% of the United States' 12 to 17 year olds are vaccinated against COVID-19, and in 9 states, less than one-third of eligible teens are vaccinated. The statistics, as reported by CNN, demonstrate the geographical gaps in vaccination seen in the country: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee in the South have less than 30% of adolescents vaccinated, as do North Dakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming (https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/08/health/us-coronavirus-friday/index.html).

Across the country, 76.2% of Americans 12 and older (the group that is eligible) have received at least one dose of vaccine and 65.8% are fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among adults, 78.0% have received at least one shot and 67.6% are fully vaccinated. The agency's COVID Data Tracker shows 56.2% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 65.1% have received at least one dose, and 3.6% have received a booster shot (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

Also today [8 Oct 2021], CDC announced that the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) will meet on 2 and 3 Nov 2021 to discuss use of the Pfizer vaccine in children ages 5-11, following a Food and Drug Administration meeting on 26 Oct 2021.

Racial COVID gap closing
------------------------
The United States reported 100 083 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [7 Oct 2021] and 2392 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 99 669, with 1765 daily deaths, according to the New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).

Throughout the pandemic, stark racial disparities have been seen across the United States, but as the 4th surge caused by the delta (B1617.2) variant hit the country this summer [2021], that gap closed as more rural communities saw increased viral activity. In these communities, White people remain unvaccinated, while more Black and Hispanic people are getting vaccinated against COVID-19.

According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, as of September 2021, "Racial disparities in cases and death rates have narrowed for Black and Hispanic people in the recent period compared to earlier in the pandemic" (https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/covid-19-cases-and-deaths-by-race-ethnicity-current-data-and-changes-over-time/).

Black and Hispanic Americans were also more likely to be exposed to the virus during earlier waves of the pandemic, as they were more likely to have front-line jobs that did not allow them to work from home. Now, as many Americans return back to work, essential workers are not the only group at risk.

80% of CFOs support vaccine mandates
------------------------------------
A survey of corporate leaders shows that 80% of US chief financial officers (CFOs) support vaccine mandates, according to CNBC. The survey comes the day after President Joe Biden's visit to Chicago, where he congratulated companies already using vaccine requirements (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/08/as-covid-fears-in-c-suite-spike-big-companies-back-vaccine-mandates.html). Only 15% of CFOs polled said they totally oppose mandates.

[It's good to see the racial gap closing between Black and Hispanic people and Whites, but it is not because the root cause of the earlier disparities has been addressed. That is, broadly speaking, essential workers had no option but to go to work and become exposed to SARS-CoV-2, while white-collar workers were more often able to work safely from home. - Mod.LK]

[3] Childhood vaccination status
[A] Routine child, adult vaccinations fell amid COVID-19
Date: Fri 8 Oct 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/routine-child-adult-vaccinations-fell-amid-covid-19


A pair of new studies yesterday [7 Oct 2021] detail lower rates of routine vaccinations amid the COVID-19 pandemic, one showing reduced weekly immunization rates and up-to-date status in US children [discussed here], and the other identifying fewer vaccine doses among both kids and adults in Michigan [see section 3B below].

An observational study published in JAMA Pediatrics analyzed data from US health systems participating in the Vaccine Safety Datalink, an ongoing collaboration between health plans and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2784888).

Eight health systems from California, Colorado, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington, and [Wisconsin] contributed data on children 0 to 18 years from before and during the pandemic. Of the roughly 1.4 million children in 2019 and 2020, 49.0% were female, 11.9% were Asian, 32.1% were Hispanic, 7.2% were Black, and 32.4% were White.

Relative to 2019 and 5 Jan to 14 Mar 2020 (prepandemic), the period of 15 Mar to 16 May 2020 (age-limited preventive care) saw lower weekly recommended childhood vaccination rates -- such as for measles, mumps, and rubella -- per 1000 population for all age-groups (for example, 160.1 in 2020 vs 194.6 in 2019 in those younger than 24 months).

Relative to the period of age-limited preventive care, weekly vaccination rates were higher in all age groups, but still low, from 17 May to 3 Oct 2020 (expanded primary care; 160.1 per 1000 vs 181.8).

Seventy-four per cent of 7 month old infants and 57% of those 18 months old were current on their vaccinations in September 2020, compared with 81% and 61%, respectively, in the same month the year before and 72% and 56% in May 2020. Lower proportions of vaccinations among children aged 13 years were also observed in September (56% vs 58% in May). By September, similar proportions of 6- and 18-year-olds were as up to date on routine immunizations as those before the pandemic.

Racial disparities identified
-----------------------------
The proportion up to date on their vaccinations was lowest among Black children of most age groups before and during the pandemic. For example, 70% of Black infants aged 7 months were current in May 2019 compared with 82% of all infants of that age combined.

Racial differences in being current on vaccinations also differed by age-group, at 88% of 7 month old Asian children, 61% of Black infants, and 76% and 41% of Asian and Black 18 month olds, respectively, in September. In the same month, Black and White 13 year olds had the lowest rates of up-to-date status, with 51% each; Black and White 18-year-olds also had the lowest rates, at 59% and 55%, respectively.

"Interventions are needed to promote catch-up vaccination, particularly focusing on populations in which disparities in vaccination coverage were evident prior to the pandemic," the researchers wrote.

In a commentary in the same journal, Brian Jenssen of the University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia, and Alexander Fiks of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said that lower vaccination rates and coverage amid the pandemic may have long-term consequences until pediatric health systems and advocates encourage parents to take their children for catch-up immunizations (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2784889).

"Healthcare system changes, such as reminding and offering vaccination in a variety of settings, and policy changes, such as vaccine mandates, will be essential in providing the impetus for families to re-engage with care and achieve timely and complete vaccination of children and adolescents," Jenssen and Fiks wrote.

[B] USA (Michigan): steepest drops in April 2020
Date: Fri 8 Oct 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/10/routine-child-adult-vaccinations-fell-amid-covid-19


In a study published in the American Journal of Public Health, a team led by Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) researchers mined Michigan vaccination registry data for routine child and adult vaccinations from 2018 to September 2020 (https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2021.306474).

Of 12 million vaccine doses, 48.6% were given to children aged 0 to 8 years, 15.6% were administered to adolescents 9-18 years, and 35.8% were given to adults 19-105. Overall doses fell starting in February 2020, with peak reductions (63.3%) in April 2020.

In all age groups, the steepest declines in vaccinations occurred in April 2020 among adolescents (85.6%), followed by children 2-8 years (82.7%), adults (82.2%), and children younger than 2 years (34.9%).

Declines in doses administered were seen in all settings except for obstetrics and gynecology offices and pharmacies, and local health departments reported a 66.4% reduction. The number of sites offering pediatric vaccines decreased, while childhood vaccination coverage dipped 4.4% in children enrolled in Medicaid.

"As we strive to achieve pre-pandemic levels of routine vaccines, it is vital to ensure catch-up vaccination of doses missed throughout the pandemic to stem outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles," study 1st author Angela Shen said in a CHOP press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/930655). "Both adult and pediatric providers must identify which patients need catch-up doses and make sure those individuals get vaccinated, so that we don't see a resurgence of viruses that we have the tools to prevent."

The researchers recommended using statewide vaccination data systems to supplement electronic health records in identifying patients due for vaccinations and contacting them to schedule appointments, expanding clinic hours and appointment times, and asking providers to ask every patient whether they are up to date on their vaccinations and either give a vaccination or refer them for one.

"As society shifts to a new normal, recalibrating to a world where SARS-CoV-2 is endemic, COVID-19 vaccines will certainly transition onto the routine immunization schedule in some form," Shen said. "It is critical to ensure the immunization delivery system supports timely, accessible, and reliable access to routinely recommended vaccines across the nation, sustaining historical high coverage in children and strengthening increasing coverage for adolescents and adults."

India has reported 21 257 new COVID-19 cases, and 271 deaths in a span of 24 hours, the Union health ministry said on Friday [8 Oct 2021]. The current recovery rate is 97.96%, the highest since March 2020.

With a decline of 3977 active cases, the country's active caseload stands at 240 221 the ministry data showed. Active cases account for less than 1% of total cases, currently at 0.71%.

The death toll has further climbed to 450 127 with 271 daily fatalities, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare. The recovery of 24 963 patients in the last 24 hours has increased the cumulative tally of recovered patients (since the beginning of the pandemic) to 33 225 221.

The daily positivity rate has been recorded at 1.53%. It has been less than 3% for the last 39 days, according to the ministry data. The weekly positivity rate has been recorded at 1.64%. It has been below 3% for the last 105 days, the ministry said.

With the administration of 5 017 753 vaccine doses in the last 24 hours, India's COVID-19 vaccination coverage crossed the landmark of 93 crore (931 717 191) as per provisional reports as of 7 am today [8 Oct 2021]. This has been achieved through 9 068 525 sessions.

India's COVID-19 tally had crossed the 20-lakh [2 million] mark on 7 Aug 2020, 30 lakh [3 million] on 23 Aug 2020, 40 lakh [4 million] on 5 Sep 2020, and 50 lakh [5 million] on 16 Sep 2020.

Sri Lanka's vaccination drive against the coronavirus which began in fits and starts in January/February this year [2021] went into top gear around the beginning of August 2021. While fully understanding the logistical and other difficulties faced by the government and the health authorities, the vaccination programme neglected the most productive age-group in Sri Lanka, which is the 30-60 group.

Whichever vaccination centre they went to, they were turned away saying only those over 60 years will be vaccinated, but with the arrival of the Sinopharm vaccine, this situation has changed for the better.

There has also been a lot of misinformation about the vaccine itself with many connected to the health sector here and abroad coming out with numerous opinions, some of which confused the general public to some extent. The social media continues to bombard information on the subject of COVID 24/7, and it is my opinion that the public should check the source and authenticity of the information before circulating it.

It is now heartening to note that the government has imported large quantities of the vaccine and is in the process of ordering more in the coming weeks. The information on the availability of the vaccine and the vaccination centres has to be clearly communicated to the people for the greater success of the vaccination programme.

The government and the health authorities should work very closely and have a very senior medical person such as the DG Health Services issue daily communiques to the public on the pandemic in the country and the progress the government is making. The public should be advised daily on the dos and don'ts with regard to the prevention of COVID.

It is also imperative that a suitable and qualified government spokesman be appointed to inform the public about the safety implementation programme put in place by the government. The government giving priority to the vaccination drive and attaching more importance to it in the current context is a big step in the right direction.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 8 Oct 2021 at 07:32 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 33 915 569 / 450 160 / 322
Bangladesh: 1 560 818 / 27 647 / 166
Pakistan: 1 256 233 / 28 058 / 124
Nepal: 800 282 / 11 200 / 376
Sri Lanka: 523 550 / 13 229 / 615
Afghanistan: 155 429 / 7221 / 180
Maldives: 85 348 / 232 / 420
Bhutan: 2613 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 148 862, 4907, 9695, 5221, and 6173 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 173 215, 7591, 13 943, 6292, and 7337 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the decreasing trend of the disease in all these South Asian countries. The development of immunity in significant sections of these countries' populations due to natural infection and by vaccination could play role in seeing such sustained dropping of new cases in recent times.

Over 930 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered in India so far (https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/over-93-crore-covid-19-vaccine-doses-administered-in-india-so-far/articleshow/86860077.cms). Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 80% of the population above the age of 18 years. So far, of the target population, 30% has received the 1st dose and 15% has received both the 1st and 2nd doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 8 Oct 2021 at 11:39 AM, a total of 89 719 686 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/). So far, Nepal has administered at least 14 382 127 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/nepal/), and Sri Lanka has administered at least 26 582 559 doses of the vaccine. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that number is enough to have vaccinated about 61% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).

The lowest number of confirmed cases recorded so far is from Bhutan (2613), with 3 deaths. - Mod.PKB]
