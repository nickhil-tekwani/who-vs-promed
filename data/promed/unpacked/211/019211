I noted the critical remarks on ProMED regarding the performance of the FAO
World Reference Laboratory for Rinderpest (WRLR), Institute for Animal
Health, Pirbright in testing the warthog samples submitted from Mauritania.
Perhaps I can clarify the situation.
Initially we were sent 2 serum samples (6 months after collection) which
had been tested previously by 3 African Laboratories and found to be
positive for antibodies to rinderpest. We found these samples to be
negative for rinderpest but positive for PPR. Almost 3 weeks later we were
sent 2 different serum samples along with an apology for sending us the
wrong samples the first time. These proved to be rinderpest-positive, as
expected. Our cumulative results now agree with those of the African
Laboratories.
The WRLR can only provide a rapid, accurate diagnostic service if the
correct samples are submitted as quickly as possible. The question remains
as to how these warthogs have antibodies to rinderpest virus, when there
have been no reports of rinderpest in West Africa during the lifetime of
these animals.

[The moderator comments referred to were: "Note that the warthog serum
samples were collected in January 2003; that laboratories in 3 different
African countries tested the sera, and found 2 rinderpest positives which
Mauritania reported to OIE on 17 Jul 2003; that the UK reference laboratory
reported the samples negative for rinderpest but positive for peste des
petits ruminants (PPR) antibodies on 22 Jul 2003 (see refs. below), but the
same laboratory confirmed rinderpest positivity after all on 7 Aug 2003;
and that this report was received by OIE on 21 Aug 2003." While factually
correct, the information on the actual samples provided to Pirbright was
not available at the time of posting. We are glad to be able to put this right.
As to Dr. Anderson's comment on rinderpest in Mauritania, the OIE
Handistatus data shows that the previous official reports of this disease
were for 1987 -- and then in cattle, not wildlife. As we have frequently
noted, while pathogens are frequently reported, the reporting of diseases
is sometimes subject to various filters, unfortunately. - Mod.MHJ]
