[Although no case numbers or exact dates are given, a 6 Jan 2016 report indicated that in recent weeks cases have been reported in some states including Bauchi, Nassarawa, Niger, Taraba, Kano, Rivers, Edo and Oyo states. Interestingly, cases in Niger, Rivers, and Oyo states are not mentioned in the above Weekly Epidemiological Report (http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/lassa-fever-spreads-to-jos-claims-one/229798/).

As noted in the comments in ProMED-mail archive no. 20150228.3199551: "Lassa fever virus [LFV] is endemic in Nigeria, and multi-mammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.) are the rodent hosts. Lassa fever is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country."

LFV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with an infected individual's viremic blood in the absence of adequate personal protective equipment. Several cases of transmission have occurred in hospitals.

As the late Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived posting 20130131.1524034: "In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multisystem disease. Rarely, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients."

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of the reservoir rodent host. In the absence of adequate infection control measures, person-to-person virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments, or in laboratories testing samples from patients.

Images of _Mastomys_ mice can be seen at http://www.ispot.org.za/node/255877.
