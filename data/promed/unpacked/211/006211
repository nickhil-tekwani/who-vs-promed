Visceral leishmaniasis disease kills 260 in south Sudan
-------------------------------------------------------
A rare parasitic disease has killed 260 people in southern Sudan in
the past year, a figure that is threatening to double in the
coming months, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday
[11 November 2010].

"Since September last year [2009], 260 people have died of kala azar
in southern Sudan, most of them children who suffer from
malnutrition," said Abdinasir Abubakar, head of the WHO in southern
Sudan.

Kala azar, or visceral leishmaniasis, is a rare tropical disease
contracted by the bite of a sand fly [Phlebotomus], endemic in some
parts of southern Sudan.

Last week [week ending 7 November 2010], the aid agency Medecins Sans
Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) warned that southern Sudan faced
a "serious outbreak" of the tropical disease, especially in the remote
states of Jonglei and Upper Nile. "The most affected areas are (still)
Jonglei and Upper Nile,particularly at Ayoka and Old Fangak (Jonglei)
where more than half the cases are concentrated," said the WHO official.

More than 9000 cases have been identified since September 2009, and
that could represent [just] the tip of the iceberg, the authorities
say. "We believe that the number of cases will double over the next 5
months," said Abubakar.

Visceral leishmaniasis, which attacks the immune system, usually
manifests itself in patients with fever, weight loss and an enlarged
spleen and liver.
About 500 000 cases are diagnosed each year, more than 90 percent of
which are found in India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sudan, and
Brazil,according to the WHO.

[Despite earlier indications of a decline in kala azar cases in
Jonglei state <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2570907/>,
the information available from the current report indicates an
increase in cases from the previous years with at least 9000 cases
reported in the past one year from the states of Jonglei and Upper
Nile. This highlights the need for a review so as to update the
current national interventions for controlling the disease.

The World Health Organization recommends endemic countries to develop
programs to reduce the disease incidence through: facilitating early
diagnosis and prompt treatment; supporting control of sand fly
populations through residual insecticide spraying of houses and the
use of insecticide-impregnated bed-nets; providing health education
and producing training materials; detecting and containing epidemics
in the early stages; and providing early diagnosis and effective
management for leishmaniasis/HIV co-infections:
