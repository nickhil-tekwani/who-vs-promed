[From a previous post: More than 200 deer killed in the area since 1994
have been infected -- the only sustained outbreak of bovine TB among
free-ranging wildlife ever documented in North America, the U.S. Department
of Agriculture says.
This is inaccurate. The population of wood bison in Wood Buffalo National
Park in northern Canada has sustained bovine tuberculosis since the
introduction of the disease in the late 1920s. The most recent research
indicates prevalence could be as high as 50% (based on serology and the
caudal fold test; Joly et al. 1998). For more information see:

and tuberculosis in bison in and around Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada.

and tuberculosis in Canadian wildlife: a review. Canadian Veterinary
