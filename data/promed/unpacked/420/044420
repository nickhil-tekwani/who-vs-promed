Indonesia: Avian influenza Situation - WHO Update 25
-----------------------------------------------
As of 9 Aug 2006, The Ministry of Health in Indonesia has confirmed
the country's 56th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. The case occurred in a 17-year-old female from
Jakarta Province. She developed symptoms on 28 Jul 2006, was
hospitalized on 4 Aug 2006, and died on 8 Aug 2006.
An investigation into her source of infection found that pet pigeons
were kept inside her home and that several neighboring households
maintained flocks of backyard poultry. Animal health authorities have
collected samples from birds in the neighborhood, and these will be
tested as part of the continuing investigation.
Of the 56 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 44 have been fatal.

Thailand: 3 Suspected Bird Flu Patients Admitted To Hospital
-----------------------------------------------
Three persons were admitted to hospital in Bangkok, capital of
Thailand, on Tue 8 Aug 2006 on suspicion of contracting bird flu
virus, an official of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration told
the Xinhua News Agency. Laboratory blood tests will take at least 3
days to confirm whether the patients were infected with avian
influenza virus, the official said.
On Mon 7 Aug 2006, a man who lives in downtown Bangkok was put in
quarantine at a hospital in Bangkok after suffering a few days of
flu-like symptoms.
Meanwhile, Thailand's caretaker Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has
[announced] at a meeting on Tue 8 Aug 2006 [an allocation of] 20
million baht (about USD 500 000) to fight bird flu, which reemerged
in the kingdom late July [2006], when a 17-year-old boy died from the
deadly H5N1 avian influenza virus, the 1st fatality of the disease
this year and the 16th death since the epidemic broke out in early
2004. The 2nd victim was a 27-year-old man who died on 3 Aug 2006.
Both of the 2 fatalities occurred in lower northern Thailand.

[The Thai Ministry of Health has changed its policy and no longer
reports cases under observation due to the prevalence of the milder
(seasonal) human influenza in the country. It is likely that these 3
patients are under suspicion of having contracted H5N1 avian
influenza virus infection due to severity of illness and have been
categorized as "suspected" cases. If confirmed, the number of H5N1
human cases in Thailand will rise to 27. The status of the
quarantined resident of downtown Bangkok is unclear at present. - Mod.CP]
