Almost 600 people have now been officially declared dead in an outbreak of
Japanese encephalitis in India. Officials fear the actual death toll might
be much higher because many deaths in rural areas are not reported. The
disease has spread to more than 27 districts in Uttar Pradesh, including
the state capital, Lucknow, and to neighbouring Bihar state and Nepal.
Encephalitis, a mosquitoborne disease, has killed at least 8000 people in
Uttar Pradesh since 1978. Officials told the BBC that many field medical
officers were not accurately reporting the death toll in their areas for
fear of being punished for failing to take sufficient action to stop the
spread of the disease.

Indian authorities are struggling to cope with an encephalitis epidemic in
the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where more than 600 people have died
from the disease, a health official said on Wednesday. The encephalitis
outbreak, which erupted in late July 2005, is centred in the eastern part
of Uttar Pradesh, but has also spread to the state capital, Lucknow.
"The management of patients is becoming increasingly difficult. There is no
let-up in new patients nor in the death toll," KP Kushwaha, a senior doctor
in a state-run medical college in Gorakhpur town, told Reuters. Kushwaha
said 31 people had died since Monday in the medical college alone. Most of
those who have died are children. Symptoms include high fever, severe
headaches and convulsions.
Officials said doctors and nurses in government hospitals in the
densely-populated region were unable to cope with the flow of patients. "We
are terribly short of doctors and nurses," Kushwaha said. "The available
staff have to perform double duties, but there is a limit to their stamina."
The state's top health official denied media reports that the government's
response to the health crisis had been slow. "We are doing all that is
needed," said the director-general of health services, OP Singh.
Local officials and media say the rearing of pigs by poor people adds to
the problem, as the animals play host to the virus.

[The dire situation regarding the Japanese encephalitis outbreak in the
state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) does not seem to be improving at all. This is
readily seen by the fact that the death toll has increased by 200 in just
one week.
UP is situated in the north/northeast of India. UP and Nepal share a
considerable border for details). The patterns of this year's JE epidemic
in these 2 areas appear quite similar (for details see:
