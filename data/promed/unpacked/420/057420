Tisbury public health officials have announced the 1st confirmed case of rabies on Martha's Vineyard in 34 years of testing.

Late last month [February 2019], the Tisbury Board of Health was advised that a "big brown bat" tested positive for rabies at the Massachusetts State Public Health Laboratory.

Rabies is a serious viral disease that can be spread through the saliva of an infected animal by a bite, scratch or if the saliva gets into a person's eyes, nose, or mouth.

The board is reminding members of the community that rabies is 100% preventable if an exposed person receives prompt rabies prophylaxis.

However, it is fatal if treatment is not initiated in a timely manner. Almost all human cases of rabies acquired in the United States since 1990 have been due to a bat strain of the virus.

Any direct contact with a bat should be considered a rabies exposure unless the person can be sure that a bite or scratch did not occur. The teeth and claws of bats are so small that a bite or scratch may leave only a very small mark and the wound may not bleed or hurt.

This means that under certain conditions, a person may not realize that an exposure has occurred.

Despite its ability to infect all mammals, rabies virus persists in numerous species-specific cycles that rarely sustain transmission in alternative species. Rabies viruses recovered from bats were shown to be distinct from rabies viruses recovered from terrestrial mammals, suggesting that these viruses evolved within their bat hosts. Genetic evidence suggests that rabies is an old disease for bats in the New World. Bats from most of the bat species in North America, when sampled in sufficient numbers, have been found to be infected with rabies virus.

Bat rabies viruses are genetically diverse, exhibiting mutations characteristic to each host bat species. It should be taken into account, however, that bat rabies can be transmitted to humans and their domestic animals, the infection almost always being fatal, unless treated. Also, a dog or a cat infected with a bat rabies virus can infect a human. - Mod.PMB
