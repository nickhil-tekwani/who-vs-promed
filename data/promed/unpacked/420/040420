Kent county woman dies of rabies, first Delawarean since 1941
-------------------------------------------------------------
A Kent county woman died last week [week of 20 Aug 2018] after being exposed to rabies -- only the 2nd Delawarean to contract and die of the disease, state health officials said Monday night [27 Aug 2018].

The woman, who lived west of Felton, was admitted to a Delaware hospital in late July [2018] after becoming sick, officials said. Her condition quickly got worse and she was transferred to a Pennsylvania hospital for treatment.

Test results did not confirm the presence of rabies until recently, officials said. The source of disease has not been identified.

State officials said the last known person to die of rabies was young boy in 1941 (https://www.delawareonline.com/story/news/2018/08/28/delaware-child-dies-rabies-1941-despite-quick-treatment/1120574002/). He was bitten by a stray dog.

Rabies is an infectious disease affecting a person's nervous system. It can occur through a bite or scratch of an infected animal or if saliva from an animal gets into the eyes, nose, mouth or opening in the skin.

Since January, the Division of Public Health has performed rabies tests on 83 animals, 9 of which were confirmed to be rabid. This includes 3 foxes, 3 raccoons, 1 cat, 1 dog, and 1 horse.

Rabies tests performed on a sheep and a dog were indeterminate, officials said.

There have been no reported cases of human-to-human transmission other than through organ transplantation, officials said.

Health officials are urging Delawareans to vaccinate their pets, avoid touching unfamiliar animals and keep an eye out for potentially rabid animals, such as foxes, bats and raccoons.

Officials said the hospitals having provided care to the patient "are conducting risk assessments with staff to identify anyone who may have had direct exposure to infectious materials and coordinating with state health officials."

The Division of Public Health is also assessing anyone who might have had contact with the patient before she became ill.

Officials said its "imperative" residents report animal bites and scratches immediately to state health officials.

People should call their doctor or call the DPH Rabies Program at 302-744-4995 or 1-888-295-5156 outside of business hours.

If you have come in contact with an animal that might have rabies, call the Department of Agriculture at 302-698-4630 or <rabies.hotline@state.de.us>.

[Hopefully the person's family may be able to provide more information regarding unknown animals or a bat in the house.

Pets should be vaccinated on a routine basis. Check with a veterinarian regarding your state and county laws on how often a vaccine is required. Generally, an animal should receive their first vaccine between 12 and 16 weeks of age. This should be followed with a vaccine at 1 year of age. If your state and/or county allow for 3-year rabies vaccine those may be given generally starting at year 2. Regulations vary somewhat based on the state and the county. If rabies has been found in your county, regulatory authorities may require vaccines every year.

Stray or wild animals may not have been vaccinated. Caution should be exercised around these animals. Bats in the house is a cause to get vaccinate. It is possible to be bit, especially as you sleep and not know it.

Generally, 2 forms of rabies are recognized. The furious form is where the animal may be aggressive. The dumb form may make an animal seem shy, quite, and withdrawn. If you do not know the animal, be cautious. If you are bitten, seek immediate medical attention and notify the appropriate department in your town/city/state regarding the procedures for the animal. Sometimes animals may not be rabid and be afraid. They may either be withdrawn and scared or scared and aggressive. So it is difficult to make a judgement regarding this. Frequently the furious form of rabies is associated with frothing at the mouth. While this related to the inability to swallow there are other reasons an animal may froth at the mouth. Those who have gotten bones or sticks stuck in their mouth may be seen frothing as well. The key here is, be cautious around animals you do not know.

According to the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC): https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html

For people who have never been vaccinated against rabies previously, postexposure anti-rabies vaccination should always include administration of both passive antibody and vaccine.

The combination of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and vaccine is recommended for both bite and nonbite exposures, regardless of the interval between exposure and initiation of treatment.

People who have been previously vaccinated or are receiving preexposure vaccination for rabies should receive only vaccine.

Adverse reactions to rabies vaccine and immune globulin are not common. Newer vaccines in use today cause fewer adverse reactions than previously available vaccines. Mild, local reactions to the rabies vaccine, such as pain, redness, swelling, or itching at the injection site, have been reported. Rarely, symptoms such as headache, nausea, abdominal pain, muscle aches, and dizziness have been reported. Local pain and low-grade fever may follow injection of rabies immune globulin.

The vaccine should be given at recommended intervals for best results. Talk to your with your doctor or state or local public health officials if you will not be able to have shot at the recommended interval. Rabies prevention is a serious matter and changes should not be made in the schedule of doses.

People cannot transmit rabies to other people unless they themselves are sick with rabies. The prophylaxis you are receiving will protect you from developing rabies, and therefore you cannot expose other people to rabies. You should continue to participate in your normal activities. - Mod.TG

We do not know how the diagnosis was made and what tissue is available, but studies of the rabies virus may indicate the likely animal source of the disease e.g., bat, dog, etc. - Mod.DK
