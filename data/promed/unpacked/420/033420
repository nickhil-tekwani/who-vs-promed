The eighth case of St. Louis encephalitis has been confirmed in Florida.
The [latest victim is a 72-year-old Charlotte County woman who lives near
the Lee County border. There is still only one recorded fatality in the
current outbreak.
According to a state health department spokesperson, "Historically, October
is the peak month for human infections during an outbreak." Citizens are
being advised against relaxing their guard [simply because of the advent
of slightly cooler weather. The 27-county alert is still in effect.
