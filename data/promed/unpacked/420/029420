The Health Ministry has issued a Dengue outbreak warning. According to
Ministry's records, 6 people were diagnosed with dengue fever this month
with most of the cases originating from Suva and Labasa.
However, the ministry is finding difficulties in determining whether these
are the actual figures as there may be other people who have yet to seek
medical attention.
The Senior Divisional Executives have been advised to issue directives to
all sub-divisional doctors to be vigilant in dengue surveillance, and
report promptly to the Ministry.
People are called on to clean their surroundings and bury all tins and
tyres that can be a breeding place for mosquitoes.
The last recorded outbreak of Dengue Fever in Fiji was in 1997-1998, when
24 000 people were affected and 13 people lost their lives.

The mosquito-borne dengue disease continued to take its toll across India
yesterday with over 40 people reported dead and nearly 3000 suffering from
it even as the government maintained the situation did not merit epidemic
status.
Health Minister Anbumani Ramadoss said: �The situation is not that of an
epidemic and we expect that the number of dengue cases will see a
decreasing trend in the next 2-3 days. So far we have recorded 2900 cases
of dengue from across the country. I would like to say that in spite of the
above numbers, the situation is under control. We are not complacent and
the situation is a matter of concern to the government,� he said.
He also briefed the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh, 3 of whose family members are feared to have been affected by
dengue, on the steps taken to contain the disease. �There is absolutely no
need for panic,� Information and Broadcasting Minister P R Dasmunsi said
after the cabinet meeting here.
The worst affected by the dengue virus is the Capital where one more
patient died, taking the death toll to 17 even as over 50 fresh cases were
reported Thursday.
Acting on a petition, Delhi High Court yesterday sought explanations from
the Central and Delhi governments as well as the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi (MCD) on their failure to deal with the outbreak of dengue in the
Capital. Taking note of the dengue toll in Delhi, many states have sounded
an alert.
In Bihar, the total number of dengue cases rose to 12 yesterday with 5
cases reported from Bettiah and Saran districts. In Haryana and Punjab, the
number of suspected cases of dengue was on the rise even as health
authorities yesterday said that the situation was not alarming.
Veena Chug, Haryana�s director of health services (malaria), said there
were 42 confirmed cases of dengue in the state, nearly half of them from
Faridabad district adjoining Delhi. She said that it was not confirmed that
a death in Faridabad was due to dengue. The government yesterday set up a
testing laboratory in Panchkula town adjoining the state capital
Chandigarh, as 6-7 suspected dengue cases were reported from Panchkula
district during the last 2 days. In Punjab, the number of suspected dengue
cases in various places was well over 150, with nearly 90 of them in
industrial hub Ludhiana itself. Punjab�s Health and Family Welfare Director
Sukhdev Singh said that no deaths had been reported in the state due to dengue.
A dozen patients from Punjab and Haryana have so far come to hospitals in
Chandigarh for treatment.

Facing an already severe dengue fever season, the government is making
efforts to keep the spread of the potentially deadly mosquito-borne disease
under control. As of Monday morning, there had been 282 reported cases of
dengue fever this year in Taiwan, most of which occurred in the Kaohsiung area.
"People have yet to realize the seriousness of the dengue fever situation
this year," according to Minister of Health Hou Sheng-mao. "We've known
since June [2006] that this [was] going to be a bad year. In fact, it
reminds me of the year 2002," he said, referring to a dengue outbreak 4
years ago that sickened 5336 people and caused 21 deaths.
Hou appealed to citizens to adopt a proactive approach to dengue
prevention. "There is only one way to beat dengue fever, and that is to
stamp out the mosquito breeding grounds," he said.
To help combat the disease, the Legislative Yuan has also established the
Central Dengue Fever Control Command Center. According to Hou, the
formation of the center will help marshal resources and coordinate action
across different government departments and municipalities. He also saw
this campaign as a learning experience for further challenges that might
lie ahead in the area of disease control, such as avian influenza.
The deputy head of the CDC, Chou Chih-hao, spoke of the government's novel
and more aggressive approach toward dengue prevention. "Those who allow
mosquito breeding grounds to persist on their property or ... who hamper
public sanitation efforts are now liable to be fined," he said. According
to Chou, it is not possible to eradicate the disease from Taiwan completely.
"Although they are not as active during the winter, mosquitoes survive from
year to year," Chou said. "Even an outbreak-free year does not signal that
dengue fever has died out completely," he said.
The objective of the new anti-dengue center is to keep the number of cases
below 500 this year -- roughly 1/10 the number of infected individuals
years ago. Chou, however, acknowledges that it is an ambitious goal. "We
are bracing ourselves for a warm winter," he said.

[It will be interesting to see if the threat of fines for residents having
dengue vector mosquito (_Aedes_) breeding sites on their properties will be
effective. No mention is made of a public education program by the Central
Dengue Fever Control Command Center. Education would seem requisite for
good public compliance. Control by the threat of legal enforcement alone
would be difficult, given the ubiquity of mosquito breeding sites. - Mod.TY]

A dengue fever outbreak in southern Taiwan could have been triggered by
dengue virus transmitted from Vietnam, a Center for Disease Control (CDC)
official said yesterday.
CDC tallies show that from the start of summer until 3 Oct [2006], the
number of indigenous dengue fever cases has totaled 291 in the country,
with 175 reported in Kaohsiung City, 110 in Kaohsiung County, 4 in Pingtung
County and one in Tainan City, all in southern Taiwan.
According to CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Chih-hao, people over the age
of 65 are the main age group affected by the disease this year, and the
dengue virus type 3 strain has been found in most of the patients.
An RNA comparison indicates that the virus strain discovered in the Taiwan
patients is 99.4 per cent similar to the strain prevalent in Vietnam, which
shows that Vietnam could be the source of the outbreak, Chou said.
He reasoned that some travelers to Vietnam could have been carrying the
disease when entering the country but were not detected by quarantine
authorities at the airport because they were not displaying any obvious
symptoms.
He noted that almost all indigenous dengue fever outbreaks occurring each
year in Taiwan have been traced to imported cases and that the Philippines
has been identified as the source of the outbreaks in the previous few years.

[Recognizing travelers incubating dengue virus infections is not yet
possible. Since importation of virus cannot be prevented, and in the
absence of a good tetravalent dengue virus vaccine, the alternative is
effective surveillance to detect cases as early as possible and the rapid
launch of vector control measures to prevent epidemic transmission of the
virus.

Several cases of dengue have been reported at the San Fernando General
Hospital and at private practitioners' offices in south Trinidad.
Some 12 cases of patients with dengue fever have been treated at the San
Fernando General Hospital and one patient from Palmiste reportedly had
dengue haemorrhagic [fever]. Up to yesterday he was reported in a stable
condition.
Reports from medical doctors in the southern area, and in particular
Palmiste, St Johns and Philippine, have reported an increase number in the
cases of dengue.
Hospital sources confirmed the dengue reports, and said: "The number of
reported cases is greater than usual, but expected now because of the rains."

WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that affects
infants, young children, and adults, but seldom causes death. The clinical
features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the patient. Infants
and young children may have a non-specific febrile illness with rash
(although some infants and very young children may develop shock syndrome,
with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume, and die). Older children and
adults may have either a mild febrile syndrome or the classical
incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset and high fever, severe headache,
pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a potentially deadly complication that is
characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often with
enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory failure. The
illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in temperature accompanied by
facial flush and other non-specific constitutional symptoms of dengue
fever. The fever usually continues for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as
40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic
phenomena. In moderate DHF cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the
fever subsides. In severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly
deteriorate after a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by
signs of circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a
critical state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no specific
treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical management by
experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the lives of DHF
patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy, mortality may be
reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the circulating fluid
volume is the central feature of DHF case management.
