During the first week of October [2022], 20 cases of dengue were confirmed on the Island, and 2 more cases were classified as probable; while during that period 9 suspected cases of leptospirosis were also identified.

The data is part of the most recent reports published by the Department of Health on both diseases and in which there is evidence of a considerable increase in infections after the passage of Hurricane Fiona.

After the passage of Hurricane Fiona, the Department of Health has received a total of 160 alerts for leptospirosis, including 4 confirmed cases, 20 probable, 84 suspected and 52 under investigation.

Health investigates 3 deaths that could have been caused by leptospirosis, including a 76-year-old man, whose contagion had been confirmed. The other 2 deaths under investigation correspond to the Ponce region: a 77-year-old man whose case was classified as probable and an 85-year-old man, whose case had been classified as suspected.

"An increase in cases is observed for the months of September and October [2022], compared to the rest of the months," reads the Special Leptospirosis Surveillance Bulletin for epidemiological week 40, which runs from [2 to 8 Oct 2022].

The towns with the highest number of total cases of leptospirosis reported after Fiona's passage are Mayag√ºez and San Juan, both with 11. However, the municipality with the highest number of confirmed and probable cases is Caguas, with 4.

Given the danger of the disease and the increase in suspected cases, Health urged citizens not to have contact with water, soil, or food that could be contaminated by coming into contact with urine or other secretions of infected animals, including rodents, dogs, cows, and pigs.
Throughout 2022, a total of 226 cases have been reported on the Island, of which 14 have culminated in deaths.

A person with fever, headache, muscle aches, bloodshot eyes, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, yellow skin and eyes, rash, and cough who has been walking barefoot through floodwaters, or has been picking up debris without proper protection, could be infected with leptospirosis.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic spirochetal infection that occurs worldwide and is transmitted to humans by exposure to soil or fresh water contaminated with the urine of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rodents) that are chronically infected with pathogenic _Leptospira_.

Hurricane Fiona made landfall in southwestern Puerto Rico on 18 Sep 2022, followed by extensive flooding that caused catastrophic damage in many communities and an islandwide electric power blackout (https://www.npr.org/2022/09/21/1124370320/puerto-ricos-infrastructure-wasnt-ready-for-the-serious-flooding-that-fiona-caus).

_Leptospira_ may survive in contaminated flood water or moist soil for weeks to months. Consequently, the outbreak of leptospirosis in Puerto Rico can be expected to persist for some time after Fiona.

In the past, parts of Puerto Rico saw more than 30 inches (76.2 cm) of rain and subsequent flooding with Hurricane Maria in 2017, which was followed by outbreaks of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis also occurred following flooding after Hurricane Hortense, which hit Puerto Rico in 1996.

For a discussion of leptospirosis, please see my moderator comments in ProMED post Leptospirosis - New Zealand: rural, occupational, animal, waterways exposures 20220706.8704256.

Dr. T Jacob John reminded ProMED readers (ProMED post Leptospirosis - France (02): (CN) cleaning a stream, comment 20221015.8706168) that when exposed to contaminated flood water and moist soil, the U.S. CDC advises "preventive measures such as chemoprophylaxis; wearing protective clothing, especially footwear; and covering cuts and abrasions with occlusive dressings. Limited studies have shown that chemoprophylaxis with doxycycline (200 mg orally, weekly), begun 1-2 days before and continuing through the period of exposure, might be effective in preventing clinical disease in adults and could be considered for people at high risk and with short-term exposures" (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/travel-related-infectious-diseases/leptospirosis). - Mod.ML
