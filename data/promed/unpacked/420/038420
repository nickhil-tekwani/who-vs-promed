Biologists are searching for clues to determine what is killing scores of
alligators, turtles and fish in Lake Griffin, one of Florida's most polluted
lakes. So far this year, 140 alligators have mysteriously died in Griffin,
30 miles northwest of Orlando. The alligators began dying in around 1997.
Since then, 312 alligators have died mysteriously. Last year, 101 alligator
deaths were recorded. Almost all are mature alligators measuring 10 feet or
more. Biologists say the animals mysteriously become lethargic, floating for
days without moving or eating. Normally, alligators live to be 80 years or
older, and dead adult alligators rarely are seen.
Biologists first ruled out viral infection. Pesticide poisoning and even
botulism, a common problem among ducks, were investigated, said biologist
Dwayne Carbonneau of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.
So far, the prime suspect is Lake Griffin's water. About 94 percent of the
lake's algae content is an exotic toxic algae _Cylindrospermopsis_, which
has been linked to illnesses in Australia. Lake Griffin's much less
prominent toxic algae, _Microcystis_, also can be deadly. But after 3 years,
biologists have yet to confirm a positive link between the algae and the
deaths, primarily because the alligators do not show typical symptoms of
the toxins' poisons.
Of reptiles sampled from the lake, researchers have found several with
microscopic sores in one area of the brain, which may hold a key to
unraveling the mystery of the deaths. The area, about the size of a match
head, controls the alligator's translation of visual signals into muscle
movements. The alligators can see and perhaps realize what is going on but
can't make their muscles respond because the lesions are slowing the signals
from the brain to the limbs, biologists said.
Biologists are now beginning to see other mysterious wildlife deaths that
may share some similarities with the large reptiles. Among Lake Griffin's
different types of turtles, members of the soft-shelled species are also
turning up dead.
Although no figures are available, Carbonneau said another species on death
watch is the long-nose gar. He said the typically hearty fish, which has
occasional die-offs each year, is showing up dead in even larger numbers
than usual.
