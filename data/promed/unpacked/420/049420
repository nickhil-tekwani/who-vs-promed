Abstract
--------
_Hypoderma tarandi_ causes myiasis in reindeer and caribou (_Rangifer tarandus_ spp.) in most northern hemisphere regions where these animals live.

We report a series of 39 human myiasis cases caused by _H. tarandi_ in Norway from 2011 to 2016. Thirty-two were residents of Finnmark, the northernmost county of Norway, one a visitor to Finnmark, and 6 lived in other counties of Norway where reindeer live.

Clinical manifestations involved migratory dermal swellings of the face and head, enlargement of regional lymph nodes, and periorbital oedema, with or without eosinophilia.

Most cases of human myiasis are seen in tropical and subtropical countries, and in tourists returning from such areas. Our findings demonstrate that myiasis caused by _H. tarandi_ is more common than previously thought. Healthcare professionals in regions where there is a likelihood of human infestation with _H. tarandi_ (regions populated by reindeer), or treating returning travellers, should be aware of the condition.

All clinicians are advised to obtain a detailed travel history when assessing patients with migratory dermal swellings. On clinical suspicion, ivermectin should be given to prevent larval invasion of the eye (ophthalmomyiasis). Since _H. tarandi_ oviposits on hair, we suggest wearing a hat as a prevention measure.

[The infection is well known although rare in Northern Scandinavia with the 1st report from Norway in 1991 (Kearney MS et al. Ophthalmomyiasis caused by the reindeer warble fly larva. J Clin Pathol. 1991;44:276-84. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2030144)
A human case has been reported from Greenland (Bangso J et al. The 1st case of _Hypoderma tarandi_-associated human myiasis in Greenland. Ugeskr Laeger. 2016 Jan 4;178(1):V10150796. Danish) as well in muskoxen (Samuelsson F et al. Warble infestations by _Hypoderma tarandi_ (Diptera; Oestridae) recorded for the 1st time in West Greenland muskoxen. Int J Parasitol Parasites Wildl. 2013 Jun 15;2:214-6. doi: 10.1016/j.ijppaw.2013.06.001). It is also found in northern Canada (Lagace-Wiens PR et al. Human ophthalmomyiasis interna caused by _Hypoderma tarandi_, Northern Canada. Emerg Infect Dis. 2008 Jan;14(1):64-6. doi: 10.3201/eid1401.070163). - Mod.EP
