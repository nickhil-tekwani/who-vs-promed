Cambodia: Avian Influenza Virus Not Found in Relatives of Dead Woman
---------------------------------------------------
No avian influenza A (H5N1) virus was found among 7 relatives of the [avian
influenza virus-positive] woman who died in a Viet Nam hospital, an
official said on Thu 3 Feb 2005. "The tests from the Pasteur Institute here
showed that they are negative for avian influenza virus infection," said Ly
Sovann, Head of the Health Ministry's infectious disease department. "We
will also carry out further tests to confirm the test result for the dead
woman," he added.
The 25-year-old woman from Cambodia's Kampot province on the border of Viet
Nam died on 30 Jan 2005, 2 days after undergoing treatment in Viet Nam's
Kaing Eang provincial hospital. The woman was believed to be the 1st person
killed by avian influenza in Cambodia. The authorities have taken blood
samples from 7 of the woman's relatives as well as the family's fowl, but
none of them was found infected with the H5N1 virus, he said. The woman's
14-year-old brother also died 21 Jan 2005 after [exhibiting] avian
influenza-like symptoms, and other members of the family were also
suffering from high fever and respiratory problems. Moreover, some chickens
and fowl fell ill and died in the area in recent months.
The Cambodian government has banned the import of poultry and poultry
products from Viet Nam and Thailand from 31 Dec 2005, as avian influenza
continued to kill people in the 2 countries. And officials were asked to be
extra careful when examining livestock and related products. AI has claimed
17 lives in Viet Nam since 30 Dec 2004.

Viet Nam: 8 Suspected Avian Influenza Cases Reported
--------------------------------------------------------
8 people from Viet Nam's northern region have been hospitalised with avian
influenza symptoms, while Viet Nam and Cambodia have pledged provincial
cooperation in fighting the disease, according to the local newspaper
"Youth" on Thu 3 Feb 2005.
The 8 patients were admitted to the Tropical Disease Institute in Hanoi on
Tuesday and Wednesday, raising the total number of confirmed and suspected
cases under treatment there to 21, according to a news report carried by
the Vietnamese News Agency. Of the patients, 3 have been confirmed to have
contracted avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection.
Since late December 2003, Viet Nam has detected 7 local H5N1 carriers from
the northern region and 10 others from the southern region, of whom 12 have
died. It has also found that a 25-year-old Cambodian woman was infected
with the virus.
On Wed 21 Freb 2005, the Health Department of Vietnam's southern Kien Giang
province informed health officials of Cambodia's Kampot province that the
woman, who died on 30 Jan 2005 in Viet Nam, had been infected with
H5N1-type virus. The woman, who lived in Kampot, adjacent to Kien Giang,
was admitted to the provincial hospital on 28 Jan 2005.
The 2 sides discussed measures to effectively curb the spread of avian
influenza among poultry and from fowl to humans. They agreed to establish
an anti-bird flu team to prevent and fight the disease in border areas of
the 2 provinces.
Avian influenza has affected 33 out of 64 cities and provinces in Viet Nam
since January 2005, killing or leading to the forced culling of nearly 1.2
million poultry. According to the country's Department of Animal Health, 4
provinces have detected no new outbreaks for 21 days, meeting the criteria
for declaring an end to the disease.
