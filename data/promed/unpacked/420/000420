Drenching rain over Mudgee has rejuvenated much of the landscape this
summer and eased the drought considerably, but it has spelt trouble
for the region's vineyards. The wet and humid conditions have
provided an ideal breeding ground for botrytis, or bunch rot.

David Lowe from Lowe Family Wines said while some vineyards have been
badly affected, others have managed to remain clean. Some varieties
are proving hardier than others. Mr Lowe said the grape varieties
that are thin-skinned, such as semillon and merlot, have suffered the
most, while the cabernet sauvignon grapes are standing up well. The
older vines in the area have also held up against the disease because
the grape bunches are dense, which lowers the chance of attack. Mr
Lowe said there will be losses as a result of the botrytis.

Mudgee Wine Grape Growers Association executive officer Mike O'Malley
said while botrytis is prevalent, the incidence varies widely and
those who have maintained good vineyard maintenance and spray regime
are in better standing. In some cases botrytis is known as 'noble
rot', which occurs when drier conditions follow rain and is used for
creating sweet desert wines.

Much of the red wine grapes have been left rotting on the vines in
the local Hunter winegrowing region as producers have struggled with
a wet growing season topped off by an even wetter January [2008]. The
rain couldn't have come at a worse time for red wine producers with
January rainfall adding insult in the crucial build-up to the harvest
in what has already been a difficult vintage, with as much as half of
the season's crop lost to disease.

Bruce Tyrrell, spokesperson for the Hunter Valley Winegrower's
Association, who has more than 40 years experience in the local
industry said it was a season reminiscent of the latter part of the
60's and early 70s. "There has been 50 inches of rain since the June
[2007] long weekend, and even with the rain there has not been a day
over 35 degrees," he said. "Now much of the crops are going to waste."

Hope Estate's Michael Hope said what had made the season so difficult
had been getting enough sunshine to ripen the reds and the disease
pressure from the rain.

Harvest 2008 is in full swing. Most of the regions are experiencing
the effect of our summer rains but, so far, it does not appear as if
it will affect the quality of the 2008 wines.

Constantia: the recent rains have resulted in some fungal disease.

Franschhoek: rain has increased disease pressures from powdery mildew
and botrytis; the biggest challenge will be to pick fully ripe grapes
that are also healthy.

Hemel En Aarde Valley: fungal disease is under control; managing
botrytis and other fungal growth remains the challenge.

Paarl: to combat fungal rot, excess leaves from underneath and within
the canopy are being removed so the wind will dry off moisture.

Robertson: has not escaped untimely rain, which for some requires
money and effort to combat mildew and botrytis.

Stellenbosch: canopy management has been vital, and fungal
disease-prone varieties have survived; everything is "on a knife
edge."

Worcester: the unseasonal rain has brought many challenges: botrytis,
excessive growth resulting from the increased nitrogen after the
thunder storms, and delayed picking, which will cause a bottle neck
in the cellars; some crop loss due to botrytis and dilution.

Klein Karoo, Durbanville, Olifants River, Swartland: so far, minimal
or no negative effects from the rains.

[_Botrytis_ bunch rot
---------------------
Bunch rot caused by the fungus _Botrytis cinerea_ has been reported
wherever grapes are grown. The disease can cause serious losses in
both yield and fruit quality. The fungus infects shoots, flowers,
leaves, and fruit. If blossoms are infected, the fungus remains
latent until berries begin to soften. Infection is optimal at 15-20
deg C (59-68 deg F) with free water or over 90 percent humidity.
Grape cultivars with dense canopies, thin skins, and/or tight
clusters are more susceptible. The rot may progress to infect whole
clusters, and girdling lesions on the pedicel or rachis may lead to
drying and premature cluster drop. Affected berries may split open,
develop a grayish mold on the surface, and may shrivel in dry
conditions. The pathogen overwinters on plant material and is spread
by water, wind, mechanical means, and juice from split berries.
Mechanical damage caused by birds or insects creates entry points for
the fungus and can greatly increase losses. Disease management relies
mainly on fungicide applications and cultural practices.

_B. cinerea_ also causes blights and grey molds on a range of other
crops, for example onion, peanut, mango, and tomato.

Powdery mildew
--------------
Powdery mildew of grapevine is caused by the fungus _Erysiphe
necator_. Leaves heavily infected by powdery mildew have reduced
photosynthetic ability resulting in decreased plant vigour and
increased chance of winter injury to the vines. Spores are spread to
the leaves and berries mainly by splashing rain, wind, or mechanical
means. The fungus overwinters in infected leaves on the ground. The
disease can be extremely serious and will cause severe crop losses.
It is usually controlled with fungicides.

Powdery mildews are a group of fungi causing similar symptoms on a
range of host plants. The group includes many species in a number of
genera. Generally, each fungal species is confined to a number of
host species it affects. The pathogens cause serious losses in many
important crops including cereals, hops, canola, sugar beet, and a
number of vegetable crops.
