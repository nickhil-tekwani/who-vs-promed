Late last week [week of 23 Nov 2015] we received a notice of suspected foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in a beef cattle herd grazing in the fenced pastures of Moshav Tzuriel, about 3 km [about 2 mi] southeast of Fassuta, where a previous FMD outbreak took place last week in a pig farm. The cattle herd numbers 90 cows, 2 bulls and 23 calves. There were 2 FMD-suspected animals: an adult cow with buccal lesions and a bull with slight lameness. From the collected samples, which were submitted to the FMD laboratory of the Kimron Veterinary Institute.(KVI), Beit Dagan, FMD virus was isolated on 30 Nov 2015 and serotyped O.

The herd and village have been declared infected; protection (3 km [2 mi]) and surveillance (10 km [about 6 mi]) zones have been set. A map of the zones and a list of included locations are attached to the circular [see map at http://tinyurl.com/j68ga28. Last week's pig-farm outbreak in Fassuta is situated 5 km (3 mi) straight north of Tzuriel. The Lebanese border is visible within the 10 km zone].

Additional instructions and updates will become available on the Veterinary Services' website.

Hopefully, no additional cases will occur in the exposed grazing cattle, and clinical signs in the (2) affected animals remain mild. Sporadic mild cases may occur, at times, even in vaccinated herds, particularly if the infection load is high. In any event, genotyping is recommended.

The grazing cattle may have been exposed to the virus through any of several potential routes, including direct or indirect contact with the neighbouring infected pig farm. Pigs are known to be the most prolific emitters of FMD virus particles, becoming a potential source of airborne transmission over meaningful distances, particularly when temperatures drop and the sky is clouded. This applies to domestic pigs as well as wild boars. - Mod.AS
