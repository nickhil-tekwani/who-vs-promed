A rare, sometimes fatal tick-borne virus has been confirmed in Dutchess County, [New York]. Allison Kaufman, county public health advisor, said a case of the virus [infection] was confirmed in late July [2018]. The person who contracted the virus reportedly had been ill since June [2018], Kaufman said. It is the 2nd confirmed case of the virus in 2018; the 1st was confirmed in Columbia County in June [2018].

"I think residents need to keep in mind this is a very serious disease but also a very rare disease," Kaufman said. "The level of concern has to be proportional to the level of risk."

She said county residents should maintain diligence in preventing tick bites to not only avoid the Powassan virus but also Lyme disease, anaplasmosis disease, and babesiosis disease.

Powassan virus has symptoms that range from mild, flu-like symptoms to life-threatening encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain. Kaufman said there is no "grace period" of tick attachment before the Powassan virus is transmitted. The virus could be transmitted in as little as 15 minutes as opposed to the 24-hour period connected with Lyme disease.

"Lint rollers can remove visible ticks crawling on clothes without having to touch the tick," Kaufman said.

Last year [2017], 4 cases were reported in the state, including one reported in Dutchess County. According to the Center for Disease Control, 21 cases of Powassan virus in the state were reported between 2007 and 2016.

State and county health officials urge outdoors enthusiasts to take steps to protect themselves from tick-borne diseases. These include the following:
- Wear light-colored clothing with a tight weave to spot ticks easily, as well as enclosed shoes, long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt. Tuck pant legs into socks or boots and shirt into pants;
- Check clothes and any exposed skin frequently for ticks while outdoors;
- Consider using insect repellent;
- Stay on cleared, well-traveled trails. Walk in the center of trails. Avoid dense woods and bushy areas;
- Bathe or shower as soon as possible after going indoors, preferably within 2 hours, to wash off and more easily find ticks;
- Do a final, full-body tick check at the end of the day and remove ticks promptly. Also, check children and pets.

The mid-Hudson Valley counties, and Dutchess County in particular, have been a hot spot for years for Lyme disease, also a tick-borne illness. More than 12 000 cases were diagnosed in the county between 2000 and 2016, according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data.

[The condition of the patient is not mentioned, other than to indicate that the affected individual had been ill since June 2018, well beyond the acute stage of the disease. Powassan virus (POWV) is endemic in New York State, and cases occur there sporadically. The tick vector is the blacklegged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_. Humans become infected with POWV during spillover transmission from the natural transmission cycles. In humans, POWV can be a causative agent of a severe neuroinvasive illness, with 50 percent of survivors displaying long-term neurological sequelae.

POWV was recognized as a human pathogen in 1958, when a young boy died of severe encephalitis in Powassan, Ontario, Canada. In this case, POWV was isolated from the brain autopsy. There are 2 distinct genetic lineages now recognized: POWV (lineage I) and blacklegged tick virus (lineage II). Since the index case in 1958, over 100 human cases of POWV have been reported, with an apparent rise in disease incidence in the past 16 years. This recent increase in cases may represent a true emergence of POWV in regions where the tick vector species are prevalent, or it could represent an increase in POWV surveillance and diagnosis. - Mod.TY
