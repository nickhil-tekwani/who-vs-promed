The regional service of Rospotrebnadzor [Russian Federal Agency for
Protection of Customer Rights and Human Welfare] has released
information about 3 fatal [human] cases from mushroom poisoning this
epidemic season [2010].

The epidemic season starts approximately at the end of August. There
were also 21 non-fatal poisoning cases. The report underlines that
all cases were etiologically linked to mushroom consumption. The
experts note that there were no fatal cases from mushroom poisoning
last year [2009].

[In Russia, as in many other parts of the world, mushroom season is
essentially just getting started. However, as mushrooms can be a bit
deceptive, it is very important to know which mushrooms are which,
and learning from a trained mycologist is valuable, perhaps so much
so as to save your life. - Mod.TG]
