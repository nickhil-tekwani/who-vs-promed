The outbreak of meningococcal meningitis that began in April has now
totaled 187 cases, with 12 deaths. This represents 27 more cases, and 3
more fatalities than were experienced last year during the same time
period. However, last year's outbreak was far above previous normals.
Parents have been warned to take children back to the doctor if their
condition deteriorates rapidly after the initial visit. Dr. Michael Baker,
of the Communicable Diseases Centre in Wellington, said that occurrence of
the disease in New Zealand typically occurs in 5 to 15-year epidemics. The
country is now in its 7th year of the current cycle.

The following data on meningococcal infection in New Zealand were extracted
from the GIDEON software program:
Most cases of meningococcal infection (73% in 1996) are reported in winter
and spring. Relative rates among Pacific Islanders/Maori/Europeans are
5.3/1.5/1.0, respectively.
An epidemic of group A meningococcal disease was reported during 1985 to
1986. Another epidemic of meningococcal disease began in mid-1991 and
continues into 1998 - serogroup B accounts for 77.6% and serogroup C for
18.8% of cases. No isolates of serogroup A were recovered during 1993 to
1996.
Reports of meningococcal disease by year:
Year Number Fatal
1989 51
1990 511
1993 139 8
1994 133 8 (Jan to Sept)
1995 394
1996 473 18 (79% serogroup B)
1997 612 24
219 cases (15 fatal) were reported during January 1 to July 10 1998. 209
