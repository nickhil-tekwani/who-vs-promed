A measles outbreak in southern Russia has affected 100 people and caused one death
---------------------------------------
The areas affected included Volgograd, the Stavropol region, Chechnya and North Ossetia. Six residents of the Volgograd region were hospitalized with a diagnosis of "measles", one of whom -- a child died. In the Chechen Republic 25 cases were registered and 37 in North Ossetia and Stavropol.

Four men and 2 women were removed from a Nizhnevartovsk-Volgograd train at Volgograd Station-1, after complaint of feeling unwell. They were taken to Infectious diseases hospital No. 1. Their condition was reported to be comfortable. The affected passengers included a 20-year-old man, 2 brothers aged 19 and 23 years, and a friend who boarded the train at Saratov. Later the hospital received 2 women from another train, also diagnosed with measles. The relevant carriages of the trains will be treated with disinfectant.

Several young people affected by the infection discharged themselves from hospital without notifying doctors. These people were travelling from a Roma community in Saratov where measles infection was rife. The hospital doctors believe that these fugitives were not aware of the danger and had returned home to the street in Volgograd where they lived. It is expected that they will be returned to the hospital under police escort so that they do not spread infection in their community.

According to the Office of the Federal Service for Supervision of Consumer Rights Protection and Human Welfare in the Volgograd region as a consequence of the epidemic throughout Europe it is likely that measles will will spread through neighbouring countries.

Unvaccinated people and those not previously exposed to measles are at risk. Measles is particularly dangerous for children under one year of age and the elderly because of the likelihood of complications. 'Life News' has has been informed that a year-old child died on New Year's Eve as a result of complications following measles virus infection. In this instance assistance was sought by Roma parents too late in the progression of the child's illness. In fact it is considered that the Roma community are principally responsible for the spread of the disease.

Rise in measles cases in Bristol 'unprecedented'
---------------------------------------
Doctors in the Bristol area say they are worried about a rise in the number of cases of measles. In 2011, 30 people contracted the virus in the greater Bristol area compared with 5 in 2010.

Prof Adam Finn, a consultant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, said last month [January 2012] he dealt with 3 cases. "Some have been significantly ill -- it's unprecedented -- I've certainly never seen it in the 10 years I've been working in Bristol," he said. "The last time we were seeing measles cases was 20 years ago or more in the 1980s," Prof Finn added.

It is believed the rise is due to the falling number of children being vaccinated -- possibly because of earlier unfounded scares over the MMR vaccine. The increase in cases locally reflects a trend observed across England and Europe.

Measles Cases On The Up
---------------------
Parents in the South West are being urged to make sure their children are protected from measles. The warning has come from NHS [National Health Service] Bristol, Bath and North Somerset, who've said there has been a series of confirmed cases of the disease across the South West.

In 2010, a total of 5 cases were reported across the former Avon area. But, in 2011, confirmed cases increased to 30 -- with over half of those cases in children under 16 years old. A spokesperson said that in recent years, not enough children have been fully vaccinated and so they are susceptible to infection. When they get measles, they pass it on to others.

Almost a quarter of children aged 5 in Bristol have not received 2 doses of the vaccine, so may be at risk of getting infected. In South Gloucestershire, North Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset areas at least one in 10 5-year olds are not fully protected. Adam Finn, Professor of Paediatrics at the University of Bristol and a Consultant at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children said: "We are reminding parents and young adults that measles can be a severe infection.

"One in 1000 cases is fatal and many more become seriously ill. Two doses of the MMR vaccine are necessary to provide protection."

Two measles cases confirmed in central Indiana
-----------------------------------------
The State Health Department confirms they have been notified of 2 cases of measles. One case is in Boone County and the other case is in Hamilton County. According to health officials, one of the infected people was in the crowd during Super Bowl festivities last Friday [3 Feb 2012]. They say that the person did not go into the NFL Experience at the Indiana Convention Center.

Health officials also say they're looking into 2 additional probable measles cases in Boone County, for a total of four. The Health Department says it's working with local health departments and health care providers to identify additional cases of measles, and to prevent further transmission of the disease. They're also working with the Centers for Disease Control, as well as health officials in New York and Massachusetts.

Measles is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by a virus. It is rare in the United States due to high levels of vaccination with the Measles, Mumps, and Rubella (MMR) vaccine; however, unvaccinated visitors from other countries can transmit measles to unvaccinated people in the U.S., or unvaccinated U.S. citizens traveling abroad can become infected during travel. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent transmission.

More than 95 percent of people who receive a single dose of MMR will develop immunity to measles, and more than 99 percent will be protected after receiving a 2nd dose. Two doses of the vaccine are needed to be fully protected. Individuals are encouraged to check with their health care providers to ensure vaccinations are up-to-date. Children are routinely vaccinated for measles at 1 year of age, and again at 4-6 years of age before going to kindergarten, but children as young as 6 months old can receive the measles vaccine if they are at risk. Individuals born before 1957 are presumed to be immune to measles. If you are unsure about your vaccination history, check with your health care provider, as they have access to vaccination records for many Hoosiers through the Indiana Immunization Registry known as CHIRP.

Some parents do not let their children get vaccinated because of unfounded fears that the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, can cause autism. Large studies of thousands of children have found no connection between this vaccine and autism. Not vaccinating children can lead to outbreaks of a measles, mumps, and rubella -- all of which are potentially serious diseases of childhood.

Super Bowl Village visitors on Friday may have been exposed to measles
----------------------------------------
Visitors to Super Bowl Village on Friday [3 Feb 2012] may have been exposed to a highly contagious disease, health officials said, and multiple health departments are collaborating to respond to the potential threat. Tuesday night [7 Feb 2012], the state Department of Health confirmed they have requested information from county health departments as part of an investigation into a report that a person who has been diagnosed with measles attended the festivities Friday [3 Feb 2012].

Officials say up to 4 people have measles. The state Health Department sent an alert to health professionals Monday afternoon that 2 cases of measles have been confirmed, one in Boone County and the other in Hamilton County. The state would not say which of the people visited Super Bowl Village, but noted he or she did not attend the NFL Experience.

According to the Super Bowl Host Committee, 200 000 people were at Super Bowl Village on Friday [3 Feb 2012]. At the free concerts late Friday night, 35 000 people were gathered to see LMFAO's performance. It is still unclear what time the ill person visited downtown Indianapolis.
