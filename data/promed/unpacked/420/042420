[1] Cholera - Tanzania, laboratory support

As of 16 May 2015, a cholera outbreak was confirmed in the Kigoma region, on the shores of Lake Tanganyika, along the Tanzania border with Burundi. Cholera is endemic in the region, but due to a recent influx of thousands of Burundian refugees, overcrowding and poor sanitation, the situation got worse. As of 28 May 2015, a total of 4487 suspected cholera cases have been reported so far.

Since more than a week ago, laboratory scientist Jacob Lusekelo and his team have worked around the clock at Maweni Hospital in Kigoma, testing dozens of stool samples. During a cholera outbreak, 1 out of 10 stool samples need to be laboratory confirmed by identifying the bacteria _Vibrio cholerae_.

"The method we use to know if a stool sample tests positive for cholera or not, is called culture and sensitivity," says Jacob. "The lab results are known after 48 hours and it basically consists of 3 phases, the media or reagents preparation, the isolation to identify the organism and lastly result release and waste disposal. The media we use for doing the tests is TCBS or thiosulphate citrate bile salt sucrose. A case of cholera is confirmed when _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 or O139 is isolated from any patient with diarrhea."

As the laboratory team of Maweni Hospital got overwhelmed with the many stool samples to be tested, WHO facilitated additional human resource support. "Through WHO, I was able to come from Dar-es-Salaam to Maweni hospital to give the lab team a much needed helping hand," says laboratory scientist Jacob Lusekelo. In addition, medical supplies and reagents were sent to the hospital to ensure the continuation of the laboratory activities. With support of WHO, the laboratory team has been able to test so far 107 samples, including 42 samples testing positive for the virulent disease.

[2] Cholera - Kenya
Date: Tue 2 Jun 2015

http://en.starafrica.com/news/msf-concerned-with-the-rapid-spread-of-cholera-in-kenya.html


Medecins Sans Frontieres/Doctors without Borders (MSF) on Tue 2 Jun 2015 expressed concern that a deadly cholera epidemic in Kenya could be exacerbated by high population density and mobility. MSF, together with Kenya's health authorities and other partners, has been battling a cholera epidemic in Kenya since January 2015. The epidemic has struck mostly overcrowded residential areas in 10 out of the 47 counties in Kenya, where thousands of Kenyans live in close proximity with poor sanitation and drainage. According to official sources, 72 deaths have been reported and more than 4000 acute diarrhea cases registered country-wide.

Although cholera is a treatable disease, MSF is concerned that the outbreak's spread and duration could be aggravated by high population mobility and congested living conditions in most of the affected areas in the capital, Nairobi. Because cholera is such a highly contagious disease, people moving to and from affected counties can easily transfer the infection from 1 locality to the next.

"MSF is particularly worried about the scale and the spread of the epidemic in Nairobi due to the high population density, particularly as it is now diffused in almost all sub-counties and informal settlements of the city," says William Hennequin, MSF head of mission in Kenya. "In Nairobi, although the number of cases fluctuates every other day, MSF teams at the cholera treatment centres inside the Ministry of Health facilities are seeing an average of 200 patients a week," he adds.

Since the beginning of the current cholera outbreak in January, MSF has worked with county governments to respond to the epidemic. MSF has set up 4 cholera units in Nairobi and has been supporting 47 facilities in 8 counties (Migori, Homa Bay, Bomet, Nakuru, Nairobi, Muranga, Kiambu and Embu), that have provided care and treatment to more than 4200 patients. To ensure infection control and quality of care, MSF has provided 301 medical and non-medical staff members. In addition, MSF has donated supplies including rehydration solution, gloves, soap and water tanks in situations when government or partners had limited capacity to do so.

MSF is ready to intervene in new locations of the country if needed.

[3] Cholera - Kenya (Elgeyo Marakwet County)
Date: Fri 29 May 2015

2 children have died of cholera in Elgeyo Marakwet county. Aged below 4, they were from Kocholwa village. Health executive Thomas Ruto said: "We have put our staff on high alert and taken measures to ensure the disease does not spread." The neighboring Uasin Gishu and Nandi counties have banned food hawking as a preventive measure. Uasin Gishu Health executive Eunice Siria says they have issued notices to shut down butcheries and hotels that violate health regulations.

Last week, Siria said they held public sessions to educate residents on hygiene. The national death toll stands at more than 50. "Public health staff are on alert and carrying out inspections. They are taking action on those operating in unhygienic conditions," Siria said. She said those found hawking food will be arrested and charged.

There have been fears that the disease will spread after the Eldoret Water and Sanitation Company disconnected water to customers who have not cleared their bills. Water executive Mary Njogu said those who pay the bills will have their water reconnected immediately. "We have asked the firm to reconnect the supply for schools and other public institutions with huge bills if they promise to pay part of it," she said. Njogu says the water shortage may lead to spread of the disease.

[4] Cholera - Nigeria (Plateau State)

No fewer than 70 people have been admitted in hospitals in Jos, Plateau State, following outbreaks of cholera and diarrhoea in parts of Jos North LGA of the state.

Daily Trust learnt from hospitals yesterday that some affected persons were admitted within the past two weeks, while some have been already treated and discharged.

A public health consultant and chief medical director of Murna Clinic in the Yan Shanu area of Nasarawa Gwom said at least 50 people had received or were still receiving treatment in his hospital. He added that about 40 of the cases were found to be diarrhoea while at least 10 were cholera cases.

"The causative organism is _Vibrio cholerae_, and it is contacted from contaminated water, food, and fruits such as oranges," Dr Samuel said, adding, "An unwashed contaminated mango is a common source of the condition and it is particularly likely in unclean environments. People are advised to watch the water they buy from water vendors with jerry cans of water fetched from untreated water sources."

A visit to the Al-ansar Clinic, also in Nassarawa Gwong, revealed that over 20 persons were admitted with suspected cholera within the past 10 days. A health personnel said over 20 persons were admitted with profuse diarrhoea and vomiting. "Right now, about 7 are receiving medical attention while the rest were discharged and there was no record of death", he said.

The Plateau State Secretary of the Nigerian Red Cross, Manasseh Panpe, who affirmed the cases of diarrhoea and vomiting, said he had no authority to confirm any cholera case but that he knew there was diarrhoea and that the Red Cross had been playing its part to contain further spread.

[5] Cholera - Haiti
Date: Thu 28 May 2015
Source NPR [edited]
http://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2015/05/28/410242929/cholera-surges-in-haiti-as-rain-arrives-early


At a government-run clinic in Diquini, near Port-au-Prince, doctors are treating a handful of cholera patients. 1 of them is a high school sophomore who has been lying on a cot with a towel over his midsection and an IV in his arm for 5 days, listening to tinny music on his bare-bones cellphone. The young man speaks in a whisper, a sign of what cholera has done to his strength. "Only 1 other person in my area has cholera," he says, through an interrupter. "She sells patties on the side of the road. I'm the 2nd victim."

An unusually early start to the rainy season has brought a spike in the waterborne bacteria -- and thus the number of infections. In the first 4 months of 2015, the number of reported cholera cases was nearly 400 per cent higher than that reported in the same period in 2014.

This outbreak in Haiti has been ongoing since October 2010 -- 10 months after the catastrophic earthquake. So far, nearly 9000 people have died, and more than 730 000 have been infected.

Scientific studies show that United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal likely imported the bacterium causing the outbreak in 2010. The UN says it's committed to eradicating cholera from Haiti, but it hasn't accepted responsibility for inadvertently introducing the disease.

An unprecedented surge in cholera cases at the end of 2014 and a harsh, early start to the rains mean this year will be bleak, says Oliver Schulz, who, until last week, led Doctors Without Borders' [MSF's] mission in Haiti. Some illegal behavior could be contributing to the spread of the disease, Schulz says. "People [are] breaking the official water pipes to illegally take the water," he says. "There's the risk of contamination. If you have an open water pipe on the ground, and there's a heavy rain, perhaps there's a latrine nearby that floods into the pipe, and it contaminates the whole system."

More than 15 000 people have been infected and another 126 have died so far during 2015, says Haiti's health ministry. But despite the grim totals, the numbers are slowing.

Back at the cholera treatment center, a man rushes in with his 1 year old daughter. She already has an IV in her arm. She is vomiting, and workers rush to surround her metal cot with buckets. Workers at a clinic near the man's home sent him and his daughter by motorcycle taxi here because the clinic is better equipped than the 1 nearby. Across the room, a woman holds her 3-year-old daughter, who after 3 days of treatment can finally sit up. The woman says the center staff told her to watch her daughter's interactions with other kids to avoid spreading infections -- and to purify the home's water to keep other kids safe. "We need to treat the water we drink with chlorine tabs," she says through an interpreter. "We need to clean the house with Clorox. We need to buy chlorine tabs." But chlorine tabs at the market cost money, she says. And she's not sure she can afford them.

[A dramatic increase in cases of cholera is reported in Haiti and the Dominican Republic in 2015. Especially in Haiti, in the 5th year of the epidemic, seeing this upswing reflects the dramatic need for improved availability of safe water and a better sanitation system in this almost forgotten epidemic. - Mod.LL]
