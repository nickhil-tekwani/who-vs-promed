[1] Omicron variant
[A] South Africa: spread
Date: Fri 3 Dec 2021

Underscoring growing concerns about omicron, scientists in South Africa said on Friday [3 Dec 2021] that the newest coronavirus variant appears to spread more than twice as quickly as delta, which had been considered the most contagious version of the virus. Omicron's rapid spread results from a combination of contagiousness and an ability to dodge the body's immune defenses, the researchers said, but the contribution of each factor is not yet certain.

"We're not sure what that mixture is," said Carl Pearson, a mathematical modeler at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led the analysis. "It's possible that it might even be less transmissible than delta."

Some of these researchers had reported on Thursday [2 Dec 2021] that the new variant may partly dodge immunity gained from a previous infection. It's still unclear whether, or to what degree, omicron may evade protection conferred by the current vaccines. The new research was posted on Twitter and has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a scientific journal.

The omicron variant has appeared in nearly 2 dozen countries. The United States has identified cases in 11 states, and health officials say that community spread of the virus is inevitable. President Biden reiterated on Friday [3 Dec 2021] morning that his administration's newest pandemic measures, announced earlier this week, should be sufficient to blunt the spread of omicron.

The variant was first identified in South Africa on 23 Nov 2021 and has quickly come to account for about three-quarters of new cases in the country. South Africa reported 11 535 new coronavirus cases on Thursday [2 Dec 2021], a 35% jump from the day before, and the proportion of positive test results increased to 22.4% from 16.5%. "It is actually really striking how quickly it seems to have taken over," said Juliet Pulliam, the director of an epidemiological modeling center at the University of Stellenbosch in South Africa, who led the earlier research on immunity.

Omicron cases in particular are doubling roughly every 3 days in Gauteng province, home to South Africa's densely populated economic hub and now the epicenter of the country's 4th wave of infections, the researchers said on Friday [3 Dec 2021]. In a mathematical analysis, they estimated the variant's Rt -- a measure of how quickly a virus spreads -- and compared it to the metric for delta. They found that omicron's Rt is nearly 2.5 times higher than that of delta.

That figure depends not just how contagious the variant may be, but also on its ability to sidestep the body's immune defenses once it reaches a new host. In related research published on Thursday [2 Dec 2021], Dr. Pulliam and her colleagues estimated the new variant's ability to evade immunity by looking at confirmed cases in the country through late November [2021].

They reported an uptick in reinfections among people who had tested positive for the virus at least 90 days earlier, suggesting that the immunity gained from a previous bout with the virus was not lasting as long as it had. The increase in reinfections coincided with omicron's spread in the country.

The team did not confirm that the reinfections they observed were due to the variant, but said it was a reasonable assumption. A similar spike did not occur when the beta and delta variants were dominant, the scientists noted. Dr. Pulliam and her colleagues estimated that the risk of reinfection with the omicron variant is roughly 2.4 times greater than the risk seen with the original version of the coronavirus.

The rise in cases in South Africa has been accompanied by a week-over-week increase in hospital admissions, already higher than seen in previous waves, according to data from South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases. But it is not yet clear whether omicron causes more severe disease than other versions of the coronavirus. The percentage of new cases found in children younger than age 5 has also risen sharply in the country, but that may be because more adults are now immunized.

[B] Global footprint expands

At least 35 countries have now reported omicron (B.1.1.529) COVID-19 variant cases, as South Africa's outbreak involving the virus continues to grow steeply with the impacts now affecting both older and younger people. And while the world braces for the impact of the latest variant, delta (B1617.2) activity continued at high levels in Europe, with signs that the virus is picking up steam again in the United Kingdom.

In an epidemiologic update today [3 Dec 2021], the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) said that globally there are 486 confirmed [omicron variant] cases in 35 countries, including 16 nations in the European Union/European Economic Area region. Though most case-patients have a history of travel to Africa, instances of community transmission have been reported, including in Finland and the United States, with suspected community transmission in Belgium, Germany, Spain, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

Based on available information, most cases are asymptomatic or mild. In its weekly communicable disease threat report, the ECDC noted that a patient in Iceland was hospitalized.

In related developments, Hong Kong researchers who investigated 2 omicron cases detected earlier this month [December 2021] at a quarantine hotel in people who stayed across the corridor from each other say the cluster likely involved airborne transmission. They described the results of their investigation in a letter today [3 Dec 2021] in Emerging Infectious Diseases (https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2802.212422).

Camera footage showed that the 2 never left their rooms and no items were shared among them. The 1st patient who tested positive arrived from South Africa on 11 Nov 2021, and the other had arrived from Canada a day earlier. Both were fully vaccinated. Hong Kong, along with South Africa and Botswana, was one of the 1st countries that uploaded omicron sequences to sharing databases.

As global health officials watch South Africa for clues on how omicron outbreaks might unfold, the country's health officials said at a briefing that the variant has triggered an "unprecedented rise" in a brief time, according to Reuters (https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/south-africas-health-minister-says-country-entering-4th-wave-covid-infections-2021-12-03/).

Michelle Groome, PhD, with South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), said infections are transitioning from younger people to those in older age groups and that hospital admissions have been rising among children younger than 4. Earlier in the outbreak, the main burden was in people in their 20s and 30s.

Today [3 Dec 2021] the country reported 16 055 new cases, up sharply from 11 535 reported yesterday [2 Dec 2021], according to an update from the NICD. Over the past day, test positivity rose from 22.4% to 24.3%.

Most new cases are from Gauteng province, the area around Pretoria. Nationwide, 279 more people were hospitalized, up from 274 yesterday [2 Dec 2021].

In an updated wastewater surveillance report, which covers epidemiologic week 47, the NICD said SARS-CoV-2 levels continue to increase in Gauteng province and Cape Town, reflecting an increase in community transmission, with increased cases and hospitalizations likely to follow (https://www.nicd.ac.za/diseases-a-z-index/disease-index-covid-19/surveillance-reports/weekly-reports/wastewater-based-epidemiology-for-sars-cov-2-in-south-africa/).

The percentage of people in Britain who tested positive for COVID-19 in the week ending 27 Nov 2021 increased, the country's Office for National Statistics (ONS) said today [3 Dec 2021] in an update. Positivity rates rose in children ages 2 through primary school, followed by those ages 35-49. The level declined in people ages 70 and older. So far, no omicron cases have been detected in the ONS survey participants.

Elsewhere, South Korea -- currently experiencing record COVID-19 levels -- reimposed gathering restrictions and broadened the use of vaccine passes.

And finally, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) today [3 Dec 2021] weighed in on recent SARS-CoV-2 findings in white-tailed deer in North America. The United States and Canada have both detected the virus in deer populations, following multiple introductions from humans. Though the deer haven't shown clinical signs, the OIE said scientists should monitor the situation, due to the possibility that deer could become a silent reservoir for the virus.

[2] South Africa news

South Africa's COVID-19 cases have nearly quadrupled in the last 4 days, underscoring concerns around how contagious the new coronavirus omicron variant might be as the country enters its 4th wave of the pandemic. On Friday [3 Dec 2021], South Africa reported on 16 055 new COVID-19 cases, up from 4373 new cases on Tuesday [30 Nov 2021].

Friday's [3 Dec 2021] numbers bring the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases past the 3 million mark since the start of the pandemic, according to data released by the country's National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD). "Today the institute reports 16 055 new COVID-19 cases that have been identified in South Africa, which brings the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases to 3 004 203. This increase represents a 24.3% positivity rate," Friday's [3 Dec 2021] statement said.

On Thursday [2 Dec 2021], the NICD also revealed that some of the new cases were people who had previously had COVID-19 and had been reinfected with the omicron variant. "Previous infection used to protect against delta but now with omicron that doesn't seem to be the case," Professor Anne von Gottberg, a microbiologist from the country's National Institute for Communicable Diseases, said during news briefing on Thursday.

"We monitored...reinfections for the beta and then for the delta wave, and we didn't see an increase in reinfections over and above what we expect when the force of infection changes, when the wave stops. However, we are seeing an increase for omicron," she said.

Data from South Africa, however, is showing that reinfections may be less severe, Professor Gottberg said. "We believe...that disease will be less severe," Gottberg said. "And that's what we're trying to prove and to monitor very carefully in South Africa. And the same would hold for those that are vaccinated," she added, stressing that vaccines will continue to help prevent severe disease and hospital admissions as cases continue to rise at a "rapid" rate.

As the numbers for new cases continue to rise, the number of deaths seems more stable in comparison, with 25 new COVID-19-related deaths reported on Friday [3 Dec 2021], the NICD said.

While only a limited number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country are being sequenced, Gottberg said, out of 249 cases sequenced in November [2021], 183 were confirmed to be the omicron variant -- equivalent to 70%-75% of cases. A total of 65 990 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, according to the NICD.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization also announced that they will deploy a surge team to the country's Gauteng province -- the current epicenter of the omicron outbreak -- to help with surveillance, sequencing, and contact tracing. The WHO will also be providing technical assistance to boost the production and distribution of medical oxygen in Botswana, where omicron has also been detected, Dr. Salam Gueye, WHO regional emergency director for Africa said.

[3] Natural infection and omicron
Date: Thu 2 Dec 2021

South African scientists are warning that reinfections among people who've already battled COVID-19 appear to be more likely with the new omicron variant than with earlier coronavirus mutants. A research group has been tracking reinfections in South Africa and reported a jump with the arrival of omicron that they hadn't seen when 2 previous variants, including the extra-contagious delta variant, moved through the country.

The findings, posted online Thursday [2 Dec 2021], are preliminary and haven't yet undergone scientific review. Nor did the researchers say what portion of the reinfections were confirmed as omicron cases -- or whether they caused serious illness. But the timing of the reinfection spike suggests that omicron "demonstrates substantial population-level evidence for evasion of immunity from prior infection," they wrote.

"Previous infection used to protect against delta, and now with omicron, it doesn't seem to be the case," one of the researchers, Anne von Gottberg of the University of Witwatersrand, said at a World Health Organization briefing on Thursday [2 Dec 2021]. The study also did not examine the protection offered by vaccination. Coronavirus vaccines trigger different layers of immune response, some to fend off infection and others to prevent severe disease if someone does become infected. "We believe that vaccines will still, however, protect against severe disease," von Gottberg said.

Dr. Michael Ryan, the head of emergencies at WHO, said reinfection turns up in the nose but it doesn't necessarily translate into severe disease, while vaccines have generally shown to help protect the rest of the body. "The data we're really looking to see is going to be around severity of infection and whether or not the vaccines continue to protect against severe disease, hospitalization and death," Ryan said. "And right now, there's no reason to suppose that they won't. We just haven't got the details yet."

The newest variant was discovered just over a week ago by scientists in South Africa and Botswana, and it's now been found in multiple countries. Much remains unknown about the new variant, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, whether it makes people more seriously ill, and whether it can thwart the vaccine.

But learning how much protection is provided by prior infection is important, especially in parts of the world where much of the population remains to be vaccinated. The study suggests "omicron will be able to overcome natural and probably vaccine-induced immunity to a significant degree," Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said in a written response to the findings. Just how much "is still unclear though it is doubtful that this will represent complete escape."

[4] Immune response following boosters
Date: Fri 3 Dec 2021
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [edited]
https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/12/six-different-covid-19-boosters-induce-variable-immune-response


A UK phase 2 trial shows that different COVID-19 booster shots are safe and boost immunity when given 10 to 12 weeks after 2 doses of the AstraZeneca/Oxford or Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, although immune responses varied widely.

In the study, the 1st randomized trial of COVID-19 booster-provoked immune response, a team led by University of Southampton researchers evaluated safety and immune response among 2878 participants 30 years or older who received one of 7 experimental or control COVID-19 boosters from 1- 30 Jun 2021. The findings were published yesterday [2 Dec 2021] in The Lancet (https://bit.ly/3dkgcYX).

Median patient age among participants who had received 2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine 70 or more days earlier was 53 years in one group and 76 in the other; 46.7% were women, and 95.4% were White. Among the 2 groups who had received 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine at least 84 days before, median ages were 51 and 78 years; 53.6% were women, and 91.9% were White.

At 18 sites, participants were classified into 3 groups (A, B, and C) and randomly assigned to receive an experimental or control vaccine. Group A received the Novavax vaccine, a half dose of Novavax, AstraZeneca, or the quadrivalent (4-strain) meningococcal conjugate vaccine as a control. Group B received Pfizer, Valneva, a half dose of Valneva, Janssen (Johnson & Johnson), or the control vaccine, and group C received Moderna, CureVac, a half dose of Pfizer, or the control.

Among participants who had received 2 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, spike immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody geometric mean ratios (GMRs) (indicating immune response) between the boosters and controls ranged from 1.8 in participants who received a half-dose of the Valneva vaccine to 32.3 in those given Moderna. GMRs for wild-type cellular responses versus controls ranged from 1.1 for AstraZeneca to 3.6 for Moderna.

Participants who had received 2 doses of the Pfizer vaccine had spike IgG GMRs ranging from 1.3 for those who received a half dose of the Valneva booster to 11.5 in the Moderna group. GMRs for wild-type cellular responses versus controls ranged from 1.0 for those receiving a half dose of Valneva to 4.7 for Moderna. The findings were similar between those 30-69 years and those 70 and older.

In a Lancet press release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/936564), trial lead Saul Faust, MBBS, PhD, of the University of Southampton, said that the results are promising. "It's really encouraging that a wide range of vaccines, using different technologies, show benefits as a 3rd dose to either AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech," he said. "That gives confidence and flexibility in developing booster programmes here in the UK and globally, with other factors like supply chain and logistics also in play."

The most common local and systemic adverse events were fatigue, headache, and pain at the injection site, which occurred more often in participants 30-69 years old than those 70 and older. Serious adverse events were uncommon and similar in both the active vaccine and control groups. Three booster vaccine combinations were more likely than others to cause adverse reactions: Moderna after 2 doses of AstraZeneca or Pfizer and AstraZeneca or Janssen after Pfizer.

Twenty-four serious adverse events occurred -- 5 in the control group (2 in control group A, 3 in control group B, and none in the control group C), 2 in the Janssen group, 5 in the Valneva group, 1 in the half dose of Valneva, 1 in Pfizer, 2 in the group who received a half dose of Pfizer, 2 in the AstraZeneca group, 1 in the CureVac group, 2 in the Novavax group, 2 in those who received the Novavax half dose, and 1 in the Moderna group.

The study authors noted that the interval between the 2nd vaccine dose and booster was shorter than between the first 2 doses in most participants, which could lessen the immune response after the booster. "Substantial differences in humoral and cellular responses, and vaccine availability will influence policy choices for booster vaccination," the authors wrote.

The researchers said that policy makers and national immunization advisory groups should establish criteria for choosing which booster vaccines to use in different patient groups. "This decision should be based on immunological considerations, known side-effect profiles, in-country availability, and ultimately a decision on what level of boost is sufficient in the context of national strategic disease control objectives," they concluded.

- UK trial involving 2878 adults aged 30 years or older shows all 7 vaccines pose no safety concerns, with fatigue, headache, and injection site pain most often reported and more common in younger people.
- Gap between 2nd dose and booster was shorter than between first 2 doses for most participants, which could lead to lower immunity boost than if longer intervals were used.
- Study assessed immune response, rather than effectiveness in protecting against infection or severe disease -- although the 2 are closely linked, the exact relationship is unclear.
- Substantial variation in the immune responses provoked by different boosters (as identified in this study), along with in-country availability of vaccines and what level of boost is sufficient for national disease control objectives will all help inform policy decisions on boosters."

The 1st patient carrying the omicron variant of the COVID-19 has been identified in Sri Lanka, the Health Ministry said today [3 Dec 2021].

The new variant has been identified in a Sri Lankan citizen who had recently returned from South Africa.

The Daily Mirror learns that he had arrived in Sri Lanka a few days ago and had been detected in the gene sequencing.

The Health Ministry has urged people not to panic as all preventive measures were being taken to prevent a spread.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 3 Dec 2021 at 07:45 GMT:
Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 34 615 757 / 470 115 / 336
Bangladesh: 1 576 827 / 27 986 / 168
Pakistan: 1 286 022 / 28 753 / 127
Nepal: 821 949 / 11 535 / 386
Sri Lanka: 565 471 / 14 399 / 668
Afghanistan: 157 387 / 7310 / 182
Maldives: 91 893 / 251 / 453
Bhutan: 2640 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 60 326, 1642, 2547, 1664, and 5126 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 65 808, 1700, 2235, 1978, and 5886 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the decreasing trend of the disease in India, also a decreasing trend in Sri Lanka but a state of almost stability in the other 3 countries. The daily case positivity still remains below 1% in India and 1.5% in Bangladesh.

On 2 Dec 2021 the Union Health Ministry of India said that 2 cases of the omicron variant (variant B.1.1.529), a variant of concern, first detected in South Africa, have been discovered in the country (https://indianexpress.com/article/india/covid-omicron-virus-variant-india-travel-guidelines-live-updates-7650606/). As indicated in item [E] above, the variant has also been detected in a person in Sri Lanka who returned to the country from South Africa recently. Updates on the variant can be seen at https://www.who.int/news/item/28-11-2021-update-on-omicron. All countries in South Asia should be vigilant and take necessary preemptive measures to prevent its spread. Preparation in these countries is also required to gather and analyze real-time disease data to assess the transmissibility, severity and probable ability of the variant to evade immunity already developed in the populations through massive vaccination initiatives and also by natural infections.

Over the course of 24 hours since yesterday (2 Dec 2021), a total of 391 people died in India due to COVID-19. Of them 320 were from Kerala state, comprising 81.84% of the total deaths encountered across the country (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). As of 3 Dec 2021 at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 257 505 514 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 80% of the population above 18 years of age. As of 24 Nov 2021, 45.29% have received the 1st dose and 26.96% of the target population have received both doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php).

As of 3 Dec 2021 at 9.39 AM IST, a total of 124 760 553 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in Pakistan (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

So far, Nepal has administered at least 17 196 377 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/nepal/), and Sri Lanka has administered at least 29 682 085. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that number is enough to have vaccinated about 68.1% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/).
