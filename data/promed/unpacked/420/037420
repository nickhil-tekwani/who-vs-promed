An outbreak of a deadly pig disease may have set the stage for Covid-19 to take hold in humans, a new analysis has suggested. African swine fever (ASF), which 1st swept through China in 2018, disrupted pork supplies, increasing the potential for human-virus contact as people sought out alternative meats.

Pork is the main meat source in the Chinese diet. The ASF outbreak had spread across most of China by the 4th quarter of 2019.

The dramatic drop in pork supply, after restrictions on movement of pigs and culling led to price rises, escalated demand for alternative sources of meat to be transported nationwide. These sources included wild animals, thus greatly increasing opportunities for human-coronavirus contact, a team of researchers from China and the UK have suggested in a yet to be peer-reviewed analysis [10.20944/preprints202102.0590.v1].

"If more wildlife enters the human food chain, either through [individuals] hunting or going to market and getting different meat sources, if that increases, it could just increase the contact opportunity," said the author of the study, David Robertson, professor of viral genomics and bioinformatics at Glasgow University. "You're just increasing the opportunity for the [SARS-CoV-2] virus to get into humans."

Key to averting another future zoonotic pandemic is the herculean task of figuring out how this one occurred. Disease detectives, including a team from the World Health Organization, are still following the trail, but many suspect SARS-CoV-2 probably originated in bats and spilled over into humans, possibly through an intermediary animal.

[The citation of the addressed preprint is: "Xia W., Hughes J., Robertson D. & Jiang X. How One Pandemic Led to Another: ASFV, the Disruption Contributing To SARS-CoV-2 Emergence in Wuhan. Preprints 2021, 2021020590 (doi: 10.20944/preprints202102.0590.v1." Its abstract concludes: "Pork prices were particularly high [during the 4th quarter of 2019] in southern provinces (Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei), where wildlife is farmed on different scales and more frequently consumed. Shandong, which experienced the biggest losses in pork production (about 1.7 million metric tons), is also the largest mink farming province. Hence, human exposure to SARS-CoV-2 from wildlife or infected animals is more likely to have taken place in 2019, when China was experiencing the worst effects of the ASFV pandemic."

In the said, yet to be peer-reviewed article, additional detail is presented on wildlife meat production: "Licensed wildlife farming was encouraged in many provinces, and financial support was provided by some local governments, especially in low-income provinces with rich natural forest and wildlife resources, such as Shandong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Liaoning and Heilongjiang. Civets, minks, bamboo rats, deer are the most popular wildlife widely farmed in China. In 2019, 11.7 million pieces of mink fur-skins, 14.4 million pieces of fox fur-skins, and 13.6 million pieces of raccoon dog fur-skins were derived in China. ... The meat of these [farmed] animals, whether used for fur such as mink or for meat such as civets and bamboo rats, could conveniently act as one of the sources for alternative meat in a culture which has a particular appetite for wildlife meat."

Civets (identified as the direct animal source transmitting SARS CoV-1 to humans in 2003) as well as minks are among dozens of species included in the price-list by one of the merchants at the Wuhan market; more details in 20200225.7024245 and 20200123.6909913. The pictured price list is accessible at https://tinyurl.com/vwt2ytz.

The open trade in minks, identified as such, for meat consumption is accompanied in China by an illicit type of trade in which the mink is mislabeled. This is the kind of activity that may have increased with ASF. As a byproduct or waste product of fur farms, it can be sold cheaply to traders who then upsell it to food producers, presumably with false labeling. The said Chinese-media-derived data and a link to the following report dated 26 Feb 2020, about the use of mink parts in food, have been submitted by ProMED Rapporteur Dan Silver (thanks!). From the report (https://finance.sina.com.cn/wm/2020-02-26/doc-iimxyqvz6015107.shtml), Dan has translated the following excerpts:

"- Investigations by China's National Committee for Biodiversity Conservation and other organizations have found that criminals are taking the meat of minks, foxes and raccoon dogs whose pelts have been removed, and passing them off as other meat products to sell in the foodstuffs market. At Huanan Seafood Market, suspected as having been the source of novel coronavirus, the meat of fox and mink or live mink has been found on the menu of the wildlife restaurant..."

"- According to investigations by China Business Network Co., Ltd., the Chinese Academy of Engineering produced a project entitled 'Research Report on China Wild Animal Husbandry Strategy for Continued Development' (2017), stating that China annually has several tens of millions of animal carcasses from pelt production, and at the peak of production in 2015 had up to about 95 million carcasses from mink, fox, and raccoon dog pelt, at a total of about 1.24 million tons. These carcasses can be purchased by itinerant traders. Some convert the meat and bones to feed, while a large quantity enters the market as other meat products for the dining table. Since they aren't inspected for disease, they can easily cause food safety problems..."

The above media report presents a picture of the carcass processing equipment of mink and raccoon in a wild animal breeding base in Hebei.

COVID-19 has been reported from mink farms in several European and American OIE-member countries, where human-to-animal and animal-to-human infections have been confirmed. China's surveillance results on its mink and other farmed wildlife are yet to become available.

On top of the search for the virus source, the questions "why now?" and "why Wuhan" are yet to be unraveled.

The impact of China's ASF epizootic upon pork availability/prices may have some relevance to the "why now?" deserving further checking. Its relatedness to "why Wuhan?" seems to be less likely.

The final report of the WHO-China mission to Wuhan in search of a COVID-19 source will hopefully help in assessing how far we are from answers. The report is reportedly expected during the current week (https://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-member-states-information-session-on-covid-19-4-march-2021). - Mod.AS
