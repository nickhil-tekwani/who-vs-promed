----------------------------------------------------------------------
_Xanthomonas citri_ pv. _mangiferaeindicae_ is the causal agent of bacterial canker of mango (_Mangifera indica_, Anacardiaceae), a disease of international importance. Since the original description of the bacterium in the 1940s, the status of cashew (_Anacardium occidentale_, Anacardiaceae) as a host species has been unclear.

We report the 1st outbreak of a cashew bacterial disease in Burkina Faso (Western Africa) where _X. citri_ pv. _mangiferaeindicae_ recently emerged on mango. A comprehensive molecular characterization, based on multilocus sequence analysis, supplemented with pathogenicity assays of isolates obtained during the outbreak, indicated that the causal agent on cashew in Burkina Faso is _X. citri_ pv. _mangiferaeindicae_ and not _X. citri_ pv. _anacardii_, which was previously reported as the causal agent of a cashew bacterial leaf spot in Brazil.

Pathogenicity data supported by population biology in Burkina Faso suggest a lack of host specialization. Therefore, the inoculum from each crop is potentially harmful to both host species. Symptoms induced on cashew leaves and fruit by _X. citri_ pv. _mangiferaeindicae_ and nonpigmented strains of _X. citri_ pv. _anacardii_ are similar, although the causative bacteria are genetically different. Thus, xanthomonads pathogenic on cashew may represent a new example of pathological convergence in this bacterial genus.

[Bacterial black spot (BBS, also called bacterial canker) of mango caused by _Xanthomonas citri_ (previously _campestris_) pv. _mangiferaeindicae_ was first described from Africa. It is now known to occur also in the Asian-Pacific region and South America. It is an economically important disease with up to 90 per cent yield losses reported. The pathogen can infect leaves, stems, and fruit, with fruit symptoms being the most economically damaging.

Symptoms on mango include small, irregular or star shaped, water-soaked lesions on fruit, which soon become raised and may crack open releasing bacterial ooze. Stem lesions appear as blackened cankers, which may crack lengthwise. Leaves also show small water soaked lesions, which become angular and raised, increase in size and may coalesce to form large necrotic patches. Their appearance is characteristic and can be used to distinguish BBS from fungal anthracnose (_Glomerella_ or _Colletotrichum_ species) which forms flat, rounded lesions. Severe infections cause defoliation and/or premature fruit drop.

On cashew, symptoms include angular, water-soaked, dark spots on leaf blades and along mid ribs, as well as water soaked areas on young fruits. Pv. _mangiferaeindicae_ can infect both mango and cashew, while pv. _anacardii_ affects cashew, but does not cause significant disease in mango. BBS can be prevalent in both low and high rainfall tropical and subtropical areas.

_X. citri_ pathovars can affect a range of tree crops, including citrus (canker) and pomegranate (oily spot; see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives). They generally live as epiphytes but occur in high concentrations in leaf and stem lesions. While they are essentially wound pathogens, they can also infect through natural openings. Incidence is increased by micro-wound development and may therefore be severe in windy areas without windbreaks, when insect populations are high, or in trees that lack vigour. The bacteria are spread by wind-driven rain, splashing water, and mechanical means (including insect and human activities). Disease management is difficult and may include cultural practices, phytosanitary measures, use of clean planting and grafting material, and bacteriocidal sprays. Infected nursery trees can be a major source of infection in new orchards. Susceptibility may vary between host cultivars.
