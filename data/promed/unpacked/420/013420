The Uganda Ministry of Health would like to declare an outbreak of epidemic
meningococcal meningitis in 2 districts of Nakapiripirit and Moroto. As of
this morning, 20 Jan 2006, 142 cases and 11 deaths had been reported in
Nakapiripirit district and 6 cases with no deaths in Moroto district.
Preliminary lab diagnosis using a rapid test suggests serogroup A. A joint
WHO/UNICEF/MSF (Swiss) team has been sent to the area to assist with
control. Any technical, logistical (especially vaccines), and financial
assistance would be appreciated.
