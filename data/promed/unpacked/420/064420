[Egypt's 27 governorates can be seen at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Egypt.

So far, 43 outbreaks of this major FMDV SAT2 epizootic have been reported by Egypt to the OIE, mapped at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11748. According to the Egyptian media, the apparent accumulated number of infected holdings is to be counted in 4-digit figures, with total number of diseased animals (cattle and buffalo) exceeding 100 000 of which more than 10 000 animals (predominantly young) have died so far. Recently, a few clinical cases in sheep were mentioned as well. However, infection in sheep may be widespread without clinical expression.

According to the Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm, citing Fathy al-Nawawy, a health professor at Cairo University, "politically motivated" government decisions to import livestock from Nile Basin countries have had grave consequences on Egyptians because of the lack of clear, uniform regulations or identification systems regarding disease control in those countries. Nawawy told Al-Masry Al-Youm that 95 percent of Egypt's livestock are owned by low-income breeders who rely on the animals for subsistence. - Mod.AS].

[2] 26th governorate, Red Sea, infected

Agriculture: emergence of 6 cases infected with foot-and-mouth disease in the Red Sea for the 1st time
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The report of 6 FMD cases in the Red Sea governorate has turned it into the 26th [out of 27] FMD-infected governorates in Egypt since the start of the epidemic on 26 Feb 2012. [Has the serotype been confirmed?]. At present, South Sinai is the only governorate not yet infected by the new SAT2 strain. [According to the Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm of 28 Mar 2012, North Sinai recorded its 1st infection a day earlier, namely Tue 27 Mar 2012; no exact location or species were mentioned. - Mod.AS]

Dr Hatem Farraj, Assistant Minister of Agriculture for Veterinary Medicine, has said that the last report received by Engineer Mohammad Reza Ismail, Minister of Agriculture, shows that the cases are concentrated in a number of governorates, especially Gharbia with a total of 25 198 cases of which 3753 dead, followed by Dakahlia with 9750 with 1717 dead, and the Suez governorate with 5142 suspected cases.

[The spread of FMDV SAT2 into North Sinai is, internationally, of grave concern. The population of FMD-susceptible animals in this governorate is estimated to amount to 160 000-200 000 small ruminants (sheep and goats) as well as several hundred (or more? -- details will be appreciated) cattle. North Sinai borders the Gaza strip and southern Israel. The animal population in Gaza (360 sq km, 140 sq miles) is estimated to be about 20 000 cattle and 70 000 small ruminants. The animal population of Israel includes about 330 000 cattle, most of them in the intensive dairy section, and nearly 500 000 small ruminants. The animal population of the West Bank/PAT (Palestinian Autonomous Territories) is about 30 000 cattle and 800 000 small ruminants. These populations have been compulsorily and periodically vaccinated against Middle-Eastern strains of FMD (O, A, Asia1) but are fully susceptible to FMDV SAT2. Their earliest vaccination is essential; supply of the SAT2 vaccine is currently limited. A homologous vaccine produced from the virus strain currently circulating would be expected to confer optimal protection; however, such vaccine has not yet been developed/manufactured. According to WRLFMD (Dec 2011), the SAT2 strain which is recommended to be included in FMD antigen banks (=strains to be included in vaccines when necessary) with "high priority" is SAT2 Saudi Arabia or equivalent; for example, Eritrea. Both are topotype VII (East Africa).

On 12 Mar 2012, Egypt submitted 28 samples to WRLFMD at Pirbright for serotyping and genotyping; SAT2 serotype was confirmed and published by the Egyptians in an OIE notification. Although the genotyping results of the Libyan and Egyptian SAT2 2012 strains are not yet publicly available on the WRLFMD website, the (commercially available) SAT2 Eritrea vaccine strain (topotype VII) may be considered as a valid vaccine candidate. Early publication of the sequencing results of the Egyptian and Libyan SAT2 strains will be helpful.

A small quantity of the said vaccine has been maintained in Israel as frozen antigen since the FMDV SAT2 outbreak in Libya in 2003. The frozen antigen has now been formulated by the Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI) and applied, after safety testing, along the border with North Sinai and the Gaza strip. This narrow buffer zone will not suffice to protect the country if/when large quantities of virus begin circulating; sufficient quantities of an appropriate FMDV SAT2 vaccine are urgently needed for Israel, the Gaza strip, the West Bank, and probably other regional parties.

The emergency situation above has recently been reviewed (see "FAO situation review, Egypt, Libya & region" in ProMED-mail posting 20120331.0743), recommendations made, and hopefully action, internationally supported, will follow to prevent the further spread of this highly pathogenic strain. - Mod.AS
