The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation today
announced that it has received the remainder of test results for
chronic wasting disease (CWD) that were part of intensive sampling
efforts in central New York. DEC has received 2 positive results for
the disease out of 292 wild deer sampled.
The 1st positive result in a wild deer was announced on 27 Apr 2005,
and came from a yearling white-tailed deer sampled from the Town of
Verona, Oneida County. The 2nd positive result is from a 3-year-old
doe (female), located within a mile of the location where the initial
positive result was detected. The sample tissues were tested at the State's
Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell University. These are the
1st known occurrences of CWD in wild deer in New York State.
DEC implemented intensive monitoring efforts after CWD was found in 2
captive white-tailed deer herds in Oneida County, the 1st incidents
of CWD in New York State. On 8 Apr 2005, the State Department of
Agriculture and Markets (DAM) completed testing of the captive deer
and found a total of 5 positive results for CWD in the 2 captive
herds.
DEC, along with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife
Services program, completed intensive monitoring on 30 Apr 2005. The
effort resulted in 290 samples of wild deer from Oneida County, 2
from neighboring Madison County, and 25 wild deer from the Town of
Arietta, Hamilton County. Since 2002, DEC has conducted statewide
sampling of wild deer for CWD. When combined with sampling efforts in
Oneida and Hamilton Counties, DEC has collected more than 3700
samples from wild white-tailed deer.
DEC and DAM will continue public outreach to interested parties in
central New York to help educate citizens on CWD and to discuss next
steps to be taken. The agencies will hold a public meeting on Thu 12
May 2005, at 7 p.m. in the Vernon-Verona-Sherrill High School
Auditorium, located on State Highway 31 in the Town of Verona. In
addition, DEC and DAM will conduct additional outreach and continue
to aggressively pursue inspection and enforcement across the State.
DAM continues to investigate, sample and test white-tailed deer from
2 captive herds directly associated with the 2 herds that were
confirmed positive for CWD in Oneida County. Results for these
sampling efforts will be announced when available.
Statewide sampling for CWD -- which has resulted in more than 1000
tests each year -- will be increased to closely monitor the
distribution and prevalence of CWD in wild deer. In addition, DEC has
implemented emergency regulations regarding the handling, transport
and management of deer in the State. The emergency regulations are
currently in effect and represent an aggressive response to the
recent discovery of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Oneida County.
DEC's emergency regulations are designed to ensure the proper
handling of deer and prevent further spread of CWD in the wild herd.
The emergency regulations are effective for 90 days. In addition, DEC
will begin the process of developing permanent regulations, which
will appear in the State Register and include a 45-day public comment
period.
CWD is a transmissible disease that affects the brain and central
nervous system of certain deer and elk. There is no evidence that CWD
is linked to disease in humans or domestic livestock other than deer
and elk. More information on CWD can be found at DEC's website at
