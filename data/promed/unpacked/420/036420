Northern Viet Nam faces lean harvest
------------------------------------
Lacking obvious solutions, the northern region may have a poor
winter-spring crop, observed Minister of Agriculture and Rural
Development Cao Duc Phat. He said that the Mekong River Delta, the
largest rice basket in Viet Nam, will have a good harvest, but the Red
River Delta is facing difficulties like epidemic diseases, a warm
winter and drought.

The Minister said that a disease on rice has spread to 18 northern
provinces, from the central province of Quang Nam northward. "Local
governments have to immediately halt this disease because it is very
dangerous, otherwise the northern region will surely have a poor
crop," Phat warned. "In 2006 we lost one million tons of rice because
of this disease."

Because of the warm winter, around 15 percent of rice seedlings have
died. He asked provinces to assist farmers in changing rice varieties
and with suitable rice transplantation schedules.

[Large numbers of different species of plant hoppers affecting rice
crops in central and northern Viet Nam were reported in the 2nd half
of 2009 (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below). The insects can
spread a number of serious virus diseases of the crop (for example
grassy stunt, ragged stunt), and these may be what is referred to
above. Other diseases, including bacterial leaf blight and the fungal
rice blast, are also known to cause problems in the region.
