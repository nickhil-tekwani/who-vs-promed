I am a doctor living in London. My whole family living in Jamshedpur
in the state of Jharkhand in India is ill with Chikungunya fever. All
the local hospitals are full. But the public has been given no
information about precautions/treatment etc. Anecdotally, this looks
like an epidemic but no reports from the Ministry of Health in India.
[This is] disappointing. Please add to your map as this might help.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in India, and there are sporadic
outbreaks there. This anecdotal report suggests that there is an
outbreak going on in Jamshedpur. ProMED would be interested in
receiving additional information about the number of cases and the
dates and places where cases are occurring.
