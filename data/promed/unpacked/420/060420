Bird flu spreads to another Russian region
------------------------------------------
Another region in European Russia, Tambov, located 400 km (250 miles) south
east of Moscow, has confirmed an outbreak of deadly bird flu virus, a
senior regional animal health official said on Monday [24 Oct 2005]. [See
map <http://tsu.tmb.ru/ano/pic/map.jpg>].
"Laboratory tests have confirmed the presence of the H5N1 strain (of bird
flu)... in some dead fowl tissue samples," the official told Reuters.
He said the disease killed 12 hens at a private dacha in Morshansk district
last week, after which local veterinary authorities destroyed 53 ducks and
hens remaining in the locality, and imposed a quarantine on it.
Since breaking out in late 2003 in South Korea, H5N1 has killed more than
60 people in 4 Asian countries and spread as far west as European Russia,
Turkey and Romania, tracking the paths of migratory birds.
Moscow confirmed last Wednesday [19 Oct 2005] an outbreak of H5N1 in the
Tula region, some 200 km (125 miles) south of the Russian capital.[See map
<http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9710/21/russia.update/link.west.russia.map.jpg>].

Last week Russia also confirmed bird flu in a village in the Chelyabinsk
region in the southern Urals and said it suspected an outbreak of the
disease in neighbouring Altai region.
Local media reported last week mass bird deaths in the southern Russian
regions of Stavropol and Rostov but authorities knocked down the reports,
saying the deaths were caused by avian diseases other than bird flu.
Russia has been fighting bird flu since mid-July [2005] and has killed more
than 600 000 domestic fowl.

[2] Azerbaijan, Hungary, Yemen - undiagnosed deaths

Bird flu case [has been] registered in Azerbaijan, said Elchin Sultanov,
Head of Republic Ornithological Center, ANS TV reported today.
According to him, a representative of [the] Center came across mass death
of migratory birds in Nakhichevan Autonomous Republic of Azerbaijan. About
200 dead ducks were found near Araz reservoir and buried.
"There might be small water birds too. They were buried. Local Veterinary
Service took samples. The results are not clear yet. If it was found in
Turkey, bird flu might appear in the Caucasus and Azerbaijan, too," said
Sultanov.
Sultanov says, though he is sure that bird flu has spread in Azerbaijan
yet, the virus was not widely revealed in the Country.
Monitoring held by Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources together with
Republic Veterinary Service did not detect this virus. Ministry of Ecology
and Natural Resources said that blood analysis was taken from dead ducks.
And if there are any flu virus in the test results, Nakhichevan would
immediately inform Baku.

[Nakhichevan is an autonomous republic of Azerbaijan forming an exclave
separated from the rest of the country by Armenia to the north and east and
bordering on Iran and Turkey to the south and west; see map
<http://www.philnet.fr/res/layout/nakhichevan.jpg>. Araz (the Azarbaijani
name) is a river rising in Anatolia in Turkey, flowing along the
Turkey-Armenia border, then along the Azerbaijan-Iran border, entering
Azerbaijan, and falling into Kura river as a right tributary. Total length
is about 600 miles.
The above information is rather ambiguous, in need of further details.
Results of the laboratory tests, confirming the suspicions or otherwise, is
urgently requested.
Ambiguous newswires and rumors are received from other countries, such as
today's (24 Oct 2005) ones coming from Hungary (dead pigeons in Szeged,
near the Romanian border, on the banks of the river Tisza which also flows
through Romania) and south Yemen (chicken in the province of Al-Kabita). If
and when clearer data become available, they will be posted. - Mod. AS].

Sweden (Eskilstuna), mallards, H5 low-pathogenic
Date: Mon, 24 Oct 2005
From: Gyorgy.czifra<gyorgy.czifra@sva.se>
4 mallards found dead in Eskilstuna [see map
<http://www.fallingrain.com/world/SW/18/Eskilstuna.html>] were submitted to
the National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala and investigated for the
presence of influenza virus starting on the 22 Oct 2005. Using an RT-PCR
assay based on the avian influenza matrix gene, presence of an avian
influenza virus was shown in the intestine of one mallard. Subsequent
testing with an H5 haemagglutinin subtype specific conventional RT-PCR and
sequencing of the 249bp amplicon spanning the HA cleavage site showed that
it was a low pathogenic H5 virus.
Comparison with published sequences was performed by searches in the NCBI
BLAST database and revealed 97 percent homology (on nucleotide level) with
a H5N2 virus A/mallard/Sweden/64/02 isolated in Sweden in 2002 (Munster et
al., 2005). According to the available sequence data, the virus is
different from the highly pathogenic Asian H5N1 strains by several amino
acid changes.
Further characterization and establishment of the N subtype will be
performed after culturing the virus in embryonated eggs.

[4] China (Anhui), chicken and goose, H5 high-pathogenic

In a follow-up report No 4 dated 24 Oct 2005, China's National Chief
Veterinary Officer notified the OIE about an outbreak of highly pathogenic
avian influenza, sub-type H5, in the village Liangying, in the province
Anhui. The outbreak involved chicken and goose; it started on 20 Oct 2005,
confirmed by the laboratory on 24 Oct 2005. Diagnosis was based upon HI,
RT-PCR and IPVI tests, carried out by the National Avian Influenza
Reference Laboratory, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. Almost 45 000
birds have been destroyed. In response to the outbreak, 140 000 avians
have been vaccinated with an inactivated mono H5N2 vaccine.

[Anhui province was reportedly infected with HPAI in 2004; an export ban on
poultry products was imposed by China's quarantine authority on 7 Jul 2005,
lifted on 31 Aug 2004 following the declared eradication of the outbreak
(See 20040902.2448). China's previous follow-up report, sent last week,
covered an outbreak in Inner Mongolia; the virus has apparently become
endemic in China, the disease controlled mainly by vaccinations. - Mod. AS].
