[All of the departments in the report above are located in the tropical lowlands of the Amazon Basin. Sylvatic yellow fever virus (YFV) is endemic in forested areas of the Amazon Basin in Peru. As of week 50, 2013 [8-14 Dec 2013], there were 20 probable and 13 confirmed YF cases in 10 regions of Peru (see ProMED-mail archive no 20140117.2180968).

In the sylvatic YFV transmission cycle monkeys may become infected and some die. The virus is transmitted by forest mosquitoes (_Haemagogus_ spp and _Sabethes_ spp). There is a risk of the virus becoming introduced into the urban/suburban cycle with transmission among people by _Aedes aegypti_ mosquitoes if the people have not been vaccinated. Significant outbreaks can result.
