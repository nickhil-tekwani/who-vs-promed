The number of Eastern Cape cases of people infected with deadly Rift Valley
fever (RVF) has jumped from 9 on Monday [3 May 2010] to 13 by yesterday [8
May 2010]. National Health Department spokesman Charity Bhengu said figures
released by the National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD) indicated
that there were now 183 laboratory confirmed human RVF cases around the
country. On Mon 3 May 2010, there were 166 confirmed cases.

The disease has already claimed 17 lives, 8 from the Free State, 8 from the
Northern Cape, and one from Oudtshoorn in the Western Cape. The Northern
Cape fatalities include the wife of a former Eastern Cape farmer and a
provincial cricketer, originally from Graaff-Reinet.

There are now 13 people infected in the Eastern Cape, 56 in the Northern
Cape, 2 in North West, 107 in the Free State, and 3 in the Western Cape.
Two further cases have not been linked to a particular province. "The
majority of human cases have had mild flu-like symptoms and no
complications," Bhengu said. "There is no human to human spread. The risk
of disease is to persons with direct contact with blood or tissues of
infected animals. The majority of people affected are those working on
farms, veterinary workers and slaughtermen."
