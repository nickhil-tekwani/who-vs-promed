WHO probing smallpox claim;
World Health Organization suspects Pakistan outbreak chickenpox
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Officials from the World Health Organization are "on the ground" in
Pakistan investigating a claim first reported in the Pakistan Dawn
newspaper that an "epidemic" of smallpox is threatening the Swabi
district of the country.
"There has not been a case of smallpox anywhere in the world since
the late 1970s, and all rumors since then have been proved to be
false," Iain Simpson, a spokesman for WHO, told WorldNetDaily.
"There have been several recent rumors from Central Asia and the
Middle East. In all cases, it has turned out to be the result of poor
translation. In each recent case, the disease was actually
chickenpox. It is likely that this is again chickenpox in Pakistan,
especially as the report itself comments that those infected are
mainly children."
According to the 9 Jun 2002 Pakistan Dawn story, "a large number of
children have suffered from smallpox." The story adds, "A health
official said that the dilemma of the people was that they were not
aware of the danger aspects of this ailment as the children suffering
from it have neither been kept in isolation nor properly treated."
While smallpox is a deadly disease, there is no mention in the story
of any deaths attributed to the outbreak.
Added Simpson, "For the moment, we are investigating, but have so far
received no information to indicate that this is in fact smallpox."
A spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control also was skeptical of
an actual smallpox outbreak. "There are so many poxes out there that
are sometimes misdiagnosed," said the CDC's Llelwyn Grant. "It could
be a number of things."
There also have been reports on the Internet recently about
"smallpox" outbreaks in India. Peter Friedlander translates Indian
news stories into English and says terminology can be a problem. "The
Hindi/Urdu term 'cecak' covers smallpox and anything that looks
similar," he explained.

SWABI, Pakistan: The smallpox epidemic is rapidly spreading in these
parts of the province, Dawn learnt here on Saturday.
It has been reported from different parts of the Swabi district that
a large number of children have suffered from smallpox.
Smallpox is a fatal disease which causes high fever, leaves permanent
marks on the skin and spreads very fast. Timely treatment and
precautionary measures are vital for controlling this malady.
A health official said that the dilemma of the people was that they
were not aware of the danger aspects of this ailment as the children
suffering from it have neither been kept in isolation nor properly
treated. And this resulted in the spread of the virus.
In most of the cases, the children of a family or those living close
to each other, contract it at one and the same time.
The residents of Naro Banda, a rural area in the district, told this
correspondent that a majority of the children in the village had
suffered from smallpox a few years back. "My 2 brothers have been
afflicted by smallpox," said one resident of Naro Banda.
The mother of a sick child said she had informed the lady health
workers about the spread of the disease 4 days ago.
It was also noticed that most of the parents of the sick children
were uneducated. They had either approached the quack living nearby,
or the self-made homeopath doctors to treat the children, but no
visible improvement could be seen in the health of the children.
If the district health department delayed taking steps for containing
the disease, the epidemic may spread to other areas in the vicinity,
or the whole of the district, for that matter.
The suffering people have appealed to the NWFP governor, district
government bosses and health officials to send in special teams to
extend necessary health cover to the children.

[We at ProMED-mail have been awaiting official reports ruling out
smallpox as the etiology of this outbreak in Sindh Province Pakistan
so that we could prepare a posting titled "Rumors dispelled, smallpox
- Pakistan: NOT". Needless to say we have received numerous emails
from our subscribers related to the initial newswire posted in Dawn
on Sun 9 Jun 2002. When we saw this report, we were fairly sure that
this was not due to smallpox due to the age distribution of cases,
and quite possibly due to an error in translation where one word
might be used for general pox-like illnesses (vesicular eruptions).
We had had a similar report from a Kurdish newspaper where the word
used for smallpox was speculated to have been a generic word for
pox-like illnesses.
The original Dawn article mentions that this outbreak is occurring in
children. Were this to be a smallpox outbreak, the odds of the cases
occurring only in children would be very low. Smallpox eradication
was declared in 1979 (the last case reported in Somalia in October
1977). In 1979, WHO recommended that vaccination against smallpox be
stopped in all countries, the only exception being special groups,
such as researchers working with smallpox and related viruses. By
1982, routine vaccination had been officially discontinued in 149 of
the 158 member countries of WHO. By 1986, routine vaccination had
ceased in all countries.
(<http://www.who.int/emc/diseases/smallpox/factsheet.html#Historical>).
Hence, even before estimating the numbers of susceptibles due to
waning immunity, all individuals born post 1986 (16 years of age or
younger) would be susceptible to smallpox. Adding on those with
waning immunity, it would be very unlikely not to have cases in older
age groups.
It is unfortunate when reports such as this hit the newswires,
especially in today's environment with heightened concerns re:
bioterrorism. The amount of fear and concern generated by a single
newswire report that may be unfounded due to an incorrect translation
seems unjustified. This last comment works under the assumption that
most languages do/did distinguish between smallpox and chickenpox.
We will post the official "NOT" as soon as it is available. - Mod.MPP]
