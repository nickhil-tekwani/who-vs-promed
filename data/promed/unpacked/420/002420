[ProMED-mail would like to thank again the team of interns from the JW LEE Center for Global Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Republic of Korea for their daily efforts in assisting us with translations of the South Korean MOH daily updates. Their dedication to helping disseminate accurate information on top of the usual challenging workload of interns has been amazing and impressive, for which we are very grateful.

As of 24 Jun 2015 there has been a total of 179 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection in South Korea, including 27 deaths for a reported case fatality rate of 15.1 percent. New cases continue to be identified, with most recent possible exposure dates up through approximate 9 Jun 2015 (in the 23 Jun 2015 report), with mostly 4th-generation cases being identified. As of 24 Jun 2015, there have been a total of 31 - 2nd-generation cases, 123 - 3rd-generation cases, 20 - 4th-generation cases, and 1 possible 5th-generation case reported. The absence of increasing numbers of 5th-generation cases being confirmed is cautiously comforting as a sign that control measures have been having an impact on transmission.

From the above summary report there was an increase in the number of identified contacts in the past 24 hours related to the newly confirmed cases.

Of note is that 83 of the 179 cases (46.4 percent) were exposed to the MERS-CoV at hospital D (Samsung hospital). On 23 Jun 2015, the "heir apparent" of the Samsung group made a public apology for the outbreak associated w/ overcrowding of the emergency room combined with suboptimal infection control procedures (see http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/23/us-health-mers-southkorea-outbreak-idUSKBN0P300920150623).

As of 12 noon today, 23 Jun 2015, there have been a total of:

1038 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including
460 deaths,
574 recoveries, and
4 currently active cases

In the past 24 hours there have been
0 newly confirmed cases,
1 newly reported deaths, and
1 newly reported recovery

[Reported case fatality rate 44.3 percent]

Information on newly reported fatality:
A 61-year-old Saudi female, non-healthcare worker from Hufoof, with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection on 19 Jun 2015, at which time she was noted to be in critical condition. At the time of initial report a possible history of contact with other case(s) was under review. - Mod.MPP]

Information on newly reported recovery:
A 60-year-old expat female, healthcare worker from Hufoof, with a history of pre-existing co-morbidities [reported as a laboratory-confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection on 20 Jun 2015, at which time was noted to be in stable condition.

[There have now been 3 consecutive days with no new cases of MERS-CoV infection reported in Saudi Arabia. One hopes this is a reflection of the impact of control measures in the 2 affected hospitals. The reported case fatality rate (CFR) has been in the 44 percent range, higher than that seen globally and significantly higher than that seen in South Korea in its current outbreak, but lower than that seen in Oman, where the reported CFR is 50 percent. One wonders how much this is a reflection of case identification vs. clinical management. As high-quality medical care is available in all of these countries, it seems likely that this is a function of case identification with a higher index of suspicion for MERS-CoV infection as a possible diagnosis for acute respiratory illness in countries with significantly lower CFRs. - Mod.MPP]

Man diagnosed with MERS 'recovering'
-------------------
A 75-year-old man diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) continues to recover, Public Health Minister Rajata Rajatanavin said.

Dr Rajata said on Tuesday [23 Jun 2015] that the Omani man would be out of danger if he tests negative over the next several days.

The patient arrived in Bangkok [Mon 15 Jun 2015], for treatment for heart disease. However, doctors later found out that he was infected with MERS-coronavirus. He and 3 relatives who travelled with him are currently in quarantine at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute in Nonthaburi province.

Health officials in the Tay Nguyen (Central Highlands) province of Lam Dong have quarantined a female Russian tourist, suspected of carrying MERS, for further observation, an official said on Tuesday [23 Jun 2015].....in isolation at the Lam Dong General Hospital in Da Lat City. The 24-year-old tourist and her friend arrived in the city 3 days ago. She has been in the country for 10 days and is believed to have transited airports in the United Arab Emirates and Thailand en route to Viet Nam. ..... developing a fever and sore throat the day before. [Low probability, but demonstrates increased awareness of health sector in Viet Nam. Da Lat is the capital of Lam Dong province in in the Central Highlands of Viet Nam. It borders with Khanh Hoa, Ninh Thuan Province, Dong Nai, Bình Thuan, Dak Lak, and Dak Nong. It is the only Central Highlands province which does not share a western border with Cambodia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A2m_%C4%90%E1%BB%93ng_Province). - Mod.MPP]

Buriram Province is now gearing up the prevention of the MERS disease, from the discovery of 3 suspected patients currently under close monitoring from the provincial public health office....3 persons in Buriram Province will be monitored by the Buriram Provincial Public Health Office as potential MERS patients, including the person who has been in contact with 1st confirmed MERS patient who is currently receiving treating in Bangkok. [no description of why persons are considered "suspected" cases, apparently 1 was an identified contact of the confirmed case. Buriram province is one of the northeastern provinces and neighbors with Sa Kaeo, Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Maha Sarakham, and Surin provinces as well as bordering with Oddar Meancheay of Cambodia to the southeast (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_Thailand). - Mod.MPP]
