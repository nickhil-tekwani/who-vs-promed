SUGARCANE MOSAIC VIRUS, MAIZE - CHINA (02)

Missing from the previous post about Maize dwarf mosaic potyvirus (MDMV)
was some information regarding transmission of the virus. MDMV is
seed-transmitted in maize, but at very low rates (0.007 to 0.4 percent) and
is transmitted by aphids from reservoir hosts to maize and presumably can
be transmitted by aphids from infected maize to healthy maize. Maize is
cultivated in China's northeastern, northern, and southwestern provinces
and sugarcane is grown extensively in southern China. Perhaps our readers
in China have more relevant information on maize dwarf mosaic disease in
that country. We would appreciate their comments.
