New Virus 'Jumps' From Monkey to Scientist, Causing Serious Illness
-------------------------------------------------------------------
A never-before detected strain of virus that killed more than one-3rd
of a monkey colony at a U.S. laboratory appears to have 'jumped' from
the animals to sicken a human scientist, researchers report. Although
it's an unusual move for that type of virus and does warrant further
monitoring, the researchers stress there is no cause for alarm at
this time. There is no evidence the virus has spread beyond the
single scientist -- who recovered from her illness -- nor is there
even proof that the virus would be transmissible between humans.

Still, "there is very strong evidence to suggest a cross-species
transmission event happened," said lead investigator Dr. Charles
Chiu, an assistant professor of laboratory medicine and
medicine/infectious diseases at the University of California San
Francisco. "I don't think people should be worried about this right
now. It's more of a worry to public health officials monitoring these
new viruses that have the potential for causing outbreaks."

The study was presented on Friday [22 Oct 2010] at the Infectious
Diseases Society of America annual meeting in Vancouver, Canada. The
scientist appears to have caught the virus while investigating an
outbreak of illness among a colony of Titi monkeys at the California
National Primate Research Center in Davis, Chiu said.

Among the monkeys, the virus was highly contagious and deadly: Of 55
monkeys housed at the center, 23 (about 40 percent) became seriously
ill with upper respiratory symptoms that progressed to pneumonia and
an inflammation of the liver. A total of 19 monkeys, or about 83
percent of those infected, died. Broad-spectrum antibiotics did not
help the monkeys, suggesting that the pneumonia was caused by the
virus and not a secondary bacterial infection, Chiu said.

Researchers later determined the cause of the illness was an
adenovirus, a broad class of viruses that can cause everything from
relatively harmless respiratory illnesses such as the common cold, to
pneumonia, as well as gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis and
inflammation of the liver in people.

The new strain, however, had never before been identified, Chiu said.
"This is almost certainly a new species of adenovirus," Chiu said.
"By looking at the 'sequence divergence,' or how different the
genetic sequence of this adenovirus is relatively to other
adenoviruses, we believe it is a new species."

The scientist who fell ill had been in close contact with the
monkeys. Though she became seriously ill with pneumonia around the
same time the monkeys were falling ill, she was not hospitalized and
recovered after about 4 weeks, Chiu said. Her blood tested positive
for antibodies to the virus 3 months after the epidemic, Chiu said.
While not a definitive test, Chiu said it's very likely the cause of
her illness was the new adenovirus.

Infectious disease and public health experts are always on the
lookout for new viruses that pose a threat to people, said Dr. Aaron
Glatt, a spokesman for the Infectious Diseases Society of America and
president and CEO of St. Joseph Hospital in Bethpage, N.Y. While this
sort of event makes infectious disease experts sit up and take
notice, "it's not something to be nervous about or worried about
today," Glatt said. "There is not a novel adenovirus associated with
a deadly outbreak in humans, but it's very interesting from a
scientific point of view." While other viruses can infect more than
one species, adenoviruses tend to be species-specific, which makes
this somewhat unusual, he said. But as of now, there is no evidence
of an outbreak of the virus outside that single monkey colony in
Davis, Glatt added.

Chiu and his colleagues are trying to determine the origin of the
virus, including whether it started as a monkey virus or began in a
human and was passed to the monkeys. Since no new monkeys had been
introduced to the colony in 6 years, one possibility is that the
virus was circulating, undetected, in rhesus monkeys also housed at
the facility and passed somehow to the Titis.

Researchers are also screening several thousand people to determine
if anyone else has antibodies to the virus, which would indicate
prior exposure and that the virus has already been in circulation in
the general human population. Another question is whether it's
contagious among people, Chiu said. "There is possibly some evidence
it's transmissible, but we just don't know yet," Chiu noted. "If this
virus has the potential for human-to-human transmission, it would
have the potential of developing into an outbreak."

While adenoviruses usually stick to one species, other viruses do
"jump" between species frequently, Chiu said, and a virus that makes
one species very ill may be relatively harmless in another. SARS
coronavirus, for example, colonizes bats and ferrets without causing
disease, while in humans the illness triggers severe pneumonia, Chiu
said. Influenza also jumps between species. Pigs may show no signs of
having H1N1 ("Swine flu"), but humans can get very sick from it.

Researchers are also working to determine if the new adenovirus is a
"recombinant," or combined virus, which includes bits of genetic
information from monkey and human adenoviruses. "When viruses jump
they can cause much more severe disease or less severe disease," Chiu
said. "These findings might be an argument to do more broad
surveillance of animals. If we can better understand what kind of
viruses circulate in animals, it might help predict what viruses
might jump over and when."

Identification of a Novel Adenovirus Associated with a Deadly
Outbreak in a Titi Monkey Colony
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Background: Adenoviruses are DNA viruses that cause a broad spectrum
of diseases in humans, including respiratory tract infections,
gastroenteritis, conjunctivitis, and hepatitis. Infection from
adenoviruses is thought to be highly species-specific.

Methods: The Virochip, a DNA microarray designed to detect all known
and novel viruses on the basis of conserved sequence homology, was
used to investigate the cause of an outbreak among a group of Titi
monkeys at the California National Primate Research Center in Davis,
California. Affected monkeys 1st developed upper respiratory symptoms
that rapidly progressed into severe pneumonia and hepatitis. Of the
60 monkeys housed at the center, 23 monkeys became extremely ill and
ultimately 19 died (83 percent mortality rate) despite aggressive
medical treatment. Necropsies of lung and liver tissue revealed acute
destruction of the parenchyma; histological examination revealed the
presence of intranuclear inclusions. Routine microbiological testing
was negative.

Results: Tissue and swab samples from infected animals revealed the
signature of an adenovirus on Virochip. Sequencing of the nearly
complete 35k [base pair] genome revealed that the adenovirus was
divergent and a member of a new group, sharing only 80-85 percent
overall nucleotide identity with its closest relatives. The
adenovirus was culturable on both human A549 and monkey BSC-1 and RMK
cells, but grew best in human A549 cell lines. Serological analysis
by virus neutralization revealed strong antibody responses in
affected monkeys who survived the outbreak but not in negative
controls. An investigator at the center in close contact with the
Titi monkeys developed a severe pneumonia at the onset of the
outbreak. Her convalescent serum collected 6 months later was
seropositive for the adenovirus, strongly implicating a cross-species
transmission event.

Conclusion: A novel adenovirus was identified as the cause of a
deadly outbreak of pneumonia and hepatitis in a Titi monkey colony,
and also appeared to have infected a human. To our knowledge, this is
the 1st example of a cross-species transmission event from adenovirus
infection. Further studies are ongoing to establish whether the virus
is of simian or human origin.

[General information on the role of adenoviruses in human disease can

photographs and information on Titi monkeys can be accessed at:
<http://www.northrup.org/photos/dusky-titi/>.

Neither of the above accounts clearly establishes the direction of
transmission of this novel pneumonia-associated adenovirus. The
information provided does not indicate whether this novel adenovirus
should be classified in the genus _Mastradenovirus_, together with
the numerous other human and simian adenovirus species previously
characterised, or whether it is a new adenovirus species that should
be ranked as the representative of an entirely new taxonomic genus.

Further characterisation of this novel adenovirus is awaited with
great interest, as are the outcomes of seroprevalence studies in the
human and Titi monkey population in their natural environment (South
America). - Mod.CP]
