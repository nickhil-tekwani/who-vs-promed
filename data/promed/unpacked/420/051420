In related news, the number of ponds in Taoyuan infected with tilapia lake virus (TiLV) has increased to 7, COA Minister Lin Tsung-hsien told a news conference in Taipei yesterday [Mon 19 Jun 2017]. Lin added that infected fish have not made it to markets.

The council on [Fri 16 Jun 2017] formed an ad hoc committee to discuss ways to deal with the outbreak, Lin said, adding that experts met in the Executive Yuan yesterday [Mon 19 Jun 2017].

Of the 7 infected ponds in Taoyuan's Guanyin District, dead fish were found in only 2 ponds, Lin said. "Infected fish lose blood and have swollen eyes -- visible symptoms that mean they are unlikely to be sold in markets," he said.

The council and the city government on [Mon 12 Jun 2017] last week announced a 2-week transport restriction, he added. Tilapia imports from nations with TiLV outbreaks, including China, Israel, Thailand and Egypt, will be banned, while controls over fish imported from other nations will be tightened, COA Deputy Minister Huang Chin-cheng said.

The council has examined 23 ponds in Taoyuan within a 3 km [approx 1.86 mi] radius of the 1st affected pond, while 30 other ponds in a 5 km [approx 3.1 mi] radius are to be examined, he added. The council also examined samples from 11 fisheries in other regions, but no infected tilapia was found elsewhere, Lin said.

Taoyuan Mayor Cheng Wen-tsan on [Sun 18 Jun 2017] urged the council to offer full reimbursement to affected fish farmers, but Lin said the case is not like avian flu, adding: "No reimbursement will be offered as the council did not kill the infected fish."

Tilapias that are susceptible to the virus are mainly of the species _Oreochromis niloticus_, the council's Fisheries Research Institute Director Chen Chu-ju said.

The source of the virus is being investigated, but it might have existed in the nation for a while, Chen said, adding that the mortality rate of 6.7 percent is relatively low in comparison with other nations where TiLV outbreaks have occurred.

The institute is developing a new species of tilapia with stronger resistance to the virus, Lin said. National Taiwan University's School of Veterinary Medicine chairman Chou Chin-Cheng yesterday [Mon 19 Jun 2017] promised to help develop quick testing for the virus, he added.

Lin was scheduled to examine the ponds in Taoyuan at 3 PM yesterday [Mon 19 Jun 2017], but canceled the trip in the morning. In response to media queries about the cancelation, Executive Yuan spokesperson Hsu Kuo-yung said in a statement that the epidemic's cause was not yet clear, so it was better not to disrupt the infected area at the moment.

[Taiwan's immediate notification on the identification of this emerging fish disease, caused by Tilapia lake virus (TiLV), was submitted to the OIE on 14 Jun 2017 (20170614.5105570). It reported one affected pond of farmed Tilapia (in Guanyin district, Taoyuan City). As apparent from the current media report, the virus is wider spread.

The global geographic distribution of 'Tilapia lake virus" (TiLV), was one of the issues addressed in OIE's relevant disease card, published in May 2017. Article 4 says (for the omitted references, please refer to the url at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Internationa_Standard_Setting/docs/pdf/Aquatic_Commission/A_TiLV_disease_card.pdf):

"TiLV has been reported in Colombia, Ecuador, and Israel and most recently, Egypt and Thailand. However, a lack of thorough investigation of all mortality incidents means that the geographic distribution of TiLV may be wider than currently [reported]. For example, reports of mortality in tilapia in Ghana and Zambia in 2016 have not been attributed to TiLV but the available information does not indicate that the presence of the virus has been investigated. A partial genome from Thailand showed relatively high variation to strains from Israel (around 97 percent nucleotide identity)."

On 26 May 2017, the FAO published an exhaustive special global alert (no. 338) addressing Tilapia lake virus; the document (6 pages) is available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-i7326e.pdf. It includes the following interesting updated information on the evolvement of the disease in Israel, where the disease was first identified:

"In Israel, the tilapia wild catch (main species: _Sarotherodon galilaeus_) in Lake Kinneret (The Sea of Galilee) dropped significantly from an average level of 257 tons per year to 8 tons per year in 2008. The drop was linked to TiLV disease. Since 2009, the tilapia catch in Lake Kinneret has been growing continuously and reached 320 tons in 2015. Although tilapia breeders report variable survival rates especially during the hot season, the total production of cultured tilapia in the last decade has been stable, ranging from 7000 to 8000 tons per year."

So far, only Israel and Taiwan have submitted official reports on this emerging fish disease to the OIE. Where, globally, this virus emerged first is yet to be investigated.
