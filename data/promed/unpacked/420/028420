A cholera epidemic has broken out in Thailand on the border with Cambodia.
According to reports reaching here from Bangkok on Friday, tens of dead
bodies are being brought to Buddhist temples for burial. There are grounds
to believe that Cambodian refugee camps with their appalling unsanitary
conditions are the source of the disease. Dead
bodies are interred without identification. Local authorities have ordered
monks to keep silent about the cause of the deaths.
