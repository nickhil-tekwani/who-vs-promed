[Screwworms are fly larvae (maggots) that feed on living flesh. These parasites infest all mammals and, rarely, birds. Two different species of flies cause screwworm myiasis: New World screwworms (_Cochliomyia hominivorax_) occur in the Western Hemisphere, and Old World screwworms (OWS) (_Chrysomya bezziana_) are found in the Eastern Hemisphere. However, the climatic requirements for these 2 species are similar, and they could become established in either hemisphere.

New World and Old World screwworms have adapted to fill the same niche, and their life cycles are nearly identical. Female flies lay their eggs at the edges of wounds or on mucous membranes. When they hatch, the larvae enter the body, grow and feed, progressively enlarging the wound. Eventually, they drop to the ground to pupate and develop into adults.

Screwworms are very susceptible to freezing temperatures or long periods of near-freezing temperatures. These organisms are seasonal in some areas and can spread into colder climates during the summer. The ideal environmental conditions for survival and activity are temperatures of 25-30 C [77-86 F] and relative humidity of 30-70 percent.

_C. bezziana_, the Old World screwworm, can be found in parts of Asia (e.g., Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent), much of tropical and sub-Saharan Africa and some countries in the Middle East. Old World screwworms have never become permanently established in Europe, Australia, New Zealand, or the Western Hemisphere.

Humans can be hosts for screwworm larvae. The disease can quickly become debilitating if it affects the eyes, mouth, nasal or frontal sinuses or the ears.

The above information comes from the fact sheet "Screwworm Myiasis," prepared by The Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University, available at
http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/screwworm_myiasis.pdf.

During 2013, Iraq reported 4 outbreaks of Old World screwworm _C. bezziana_, one in the province of Al Qadisiyah, one in the province of Diyala, and 2 in the province of Ninawa. This information and additional data on these outbreaks can be found in the WAHID database at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (Note: to view the information on OWS, you need to scroll down to the name of the disease and choose the region or country and time period).

According to the information found in the WAHID database under the section "List of countries by sanitary situation" http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statuslist, 153 of 178 OIE Member countries have provided some information related to Old World screwworm _C. bezziana_, (this information is based on the most recent 6-monthly report sent by the countries).

Of these 153 countries, the disease was reported as "never occurred" in 124, as "absent" in 19, as "infection present (with no clinical disease)" in 2 (Angola and Oman), and as "demonstrated clinical disease" in 8 (Hong Kong (SAR-PCR), Iraq, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Yemen, Zimbabwe, Iran, Papua New Guinea).
