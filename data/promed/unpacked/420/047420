Here in the State of Florida, USA, our original state health department
(and first health regulatory agency), then known as the Florida State
Board of Health, was created in direct response to a yellow fever
outbreak in the port city of Jacksonville. This body was created in
1889 only after political pressure (and the fact that the governor's own
brother died from yellow fever).
A proposal for such an agency had been made to our state legislature in
1873, but the appropriation of U.S. $200 was deemed too high.
There had been numerous outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases, thousands
of deaths and many thousands of cases through the past centuries of
European occupation in Florida -- so much so that the summer months were
commonly referred to as the "fever or sickly season" -- and yellow fever,
dengue and malaria were to some extent endemic in Florida, or were
constantly re-introduced via shipboard travel from points in the
Caribbean.
Throughout the remainder of the century and into the 1920s a
mainstay of the "Board" were revenues generated through operation of up
to seven quarantine stations at ports throughout the state, from Santa
Rosa Island on the Gulf of Mexico (off Pensacola) to Tampa, Key West,
St. Augustine and Jacksonville and points between. At smaller ports
during the period we had "sanitary maritime inspectors" who went aboard
ships and checked the papers and could order vessels quarantined if
there was either apparent sickness aboard or it had arrived from a known
endemic region during the "fever season."
One fellow by the name of Morris Cochran is something of a folk hero in
our department because during such an inspection he was thrown overboard
in Boca Grande Pass (off Port Charlotte) at dusk and was lucky to reach
his launch and make it back to shore. Following that he made a report
to his boss (the State Health Officer located about 400 miles north in
Jacksonville) in a letter stating that he would be glad for some help
and "could he carry his Winchester with him?"
This activity was kept up by the state until the stations were given to
the U.S. Marine Hospital Service. All the stations eventually closed.
Today, inspections of ships and outbreak investigations of ships other
than those registered in Florida are under the authority of the CDC's
Vessel Sanitation Program (www.cdc.gov/nceh/ncehhome.htm, then click
on Programs).
As long [as people arrived in large numbers by ship and infectious
diseases arrived
along with them, ship inspection and quarantine remained important
missions here.

[There seems to have been a general slackening off of port & airport
health inspections over the past few decades. Nobody asks to see
your vaccination certificate any more -- do you even know where yours
is? -- nobody hands out yellow cards on arrival advising you to see a
doctor if you fall ill within two weeks of arriving from abroad, and
tell him you've been traveling - Mod.JW

Don't forget that our own Public Health Service (PHS) began as a health
service for sailors in U.S. ports.
