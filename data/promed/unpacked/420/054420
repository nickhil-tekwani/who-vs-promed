[The total number of cases reported in the full report is now closer
to 70 000 than 60 000, at 65 739, and the total fatality count is
3323. The horrendous outbreak continues to spread to new areas and
the overall case fatality rate, reflecting the overall poor
conditions in the country, remains very high at 5.1 percent.

[2] Cholera - Malawi
Date: Wed 4 Feb 2009

As the cholera outbreak in Malawi escalates, the number of cases more
than doubled in January 2009 with 1142 cumulative cases recorded and
39 deaths, and the number continues to rise.

Exacerbated by poor sanitation and rainy season floods, the outbreak
started in the capital, Lilongwe, on 17 Nov 2008, quickly spreading
to 2 of the capital's densely populated slums where there is no
running water. The disease has now spread to more than 30 percent of
the districts in the country, with the highest concentration
remaining in and around Lilongwe.

"39 people have died from cholera with more than 1000 cases
recorded," said Dr Moses Massaquoi, medical coordinator in Malawi for
Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF). "It's extremely worrying as the
disease continues to spread and numbers mount. Every day the rain
pounds down and people with no access to safe water resort to
drinking untreated water from swamps or from unprotected wells in
slums. As one of the poorest countries in the world, water and
sanitation levels are extremely low. On top of this, the floods cause
latrines to overflow and sewage then mixes with drinking water."

While cholera is endemic in Malawi, it has been 8 years since the
country's worst outbreak, which killed almost 1000 people, so that
much of the "memory" of how to respond to cholera is lost. As a
result, MSF medical staff are carrying out intensive bedside training
and mentoring for national Malawian nurses and assisting them in
handling cases to increase their capacity to respond to and contain
this outbreak.

[3] Cholera - Mozambique (Cabo Delgado)

The health authorities in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo
Delgado have warned that the cholera outbreak in this part of the
country could worsen if attacks against health workers and sabotage
of cholera treatment centres continue. Cabo Delgado has seen a wave
of disinformation, according to which the very people trying to treat
the disease are accused of spreading it.

"If this situation is not corrected urgently, we could have negative
results in our program to prevent and fight against cholera
throughout the province," he warned.

In the provincial capital, Pemba, and in the town of Montepuez tents
used as cholera treatment centres have been burnt down, by angry mobs
who have swallowed the rumour that the treatment centres cause the disease.

Cholera has claimed 4 lives in Montepuez since the start of the
outbreak in late December 2008. Over the past weekend, 30 new cases
of the disease were reported in this district.

[4] Cholera - South Africa (Limpopo)

80 new cholera cases have emerged in Limpopo as the disease continues
to spread like wild fire in the province. The official death toll
remained unchanged at 20 yesterday [3 Feb 2009]. Provincial spokesman
for the department of health and social development, Phuti Seloba,
said new cases of infections were increasing and putting the lives of
ordinary people in danger.

The latest developments bring to 3680 the total number of cases that
had been dealt with since the outbreak of the disease on 15 Nov 2008.
Seloba said the Vhembe district had 16 new cases, Capricorn 37,
Sekhukhune 9, Mopani 2, and Waterberg 16.

The disease was first believed to have been brought about as a result
of the high influx of Zimbabweans who crossed into South Africa to
seek treatment. This was after they were found to have been exposed
to contaminated sewerage water in their country, resulting in the
outbreak. But now the majority of those contracting the disease or
dying from it are South African citizens.

[5] Cholera - China (Yunnan)

All 47 people struck down during a cholera epidemic last month
[January 2009] in Yuxi city of southwestern China's Yunnan Province
have fully recovered, a provincial official said in Yuxi Monday [2
Feb 2009]. The outbreak in Tonghai, Huaning, and Jiangchuan counties
on 18 Jan 2009 led to 20 confirmed cases of cholera, with 27 people
also found to be carrying the cholera bacterium, Chen Juemin,
director of the provincial health department, said at a press
conference in Yuxi.

"No deaths were reported," Chen was quoted by Wednesday's [4 Feb
2009] China Daily. Chen said all 47 patients had been among the 585
villagers who attended a funeral feast in Tonghai from 15 to 17 Jan
2009. Around 3 am on 18 Jan 2009, the 1st patient, aged 73, was
admitted to a local hospital suffering diarrhea, and was followed by
another 2 later that day, the director said.

On the morning of 21 Jan 2009, the Yuxi center for disease control
initially diagnosed _Vibrio cholerae_ O139 type, confirming the
infection the following day, Chen said. After the reported outbreak,
all 585 who attended the feast, along with those who had come into
immediate contact with them, were isolated. Local police also closed
infected areas, while the local health department checked the health
of 8 561 villagers, the government said.

Investigators found that 26 of the 585 people at the feast had
traveled abroad and visited high-risk cholera areas, with one of
those identified as carrying the disease having done the cooking for the feast.

In October 2008, an 8-year-old girl died of cholera during an
outbreak in Hainan Province, where 46 cases were reported.

[As a short review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are
shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in
distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic)
antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139
known serotypes. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are
nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which
is "non-O1"), a single serotype, designated O1, has been responsible
for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima,
each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype. The
biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A,
B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C;
and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively rare.

[6] Amoebic dysentery - Philippines (Bukidnon)

According to the City Health Office [CHO], 6 persons died, including
a 9-year-old boy and 3 senior citizens, while more than half of the
population of a remote village [in Bukidnon province] fell ill of
amoebiasis in the last 2 months. Dr Dennis Sangalang, CHO chief, said
the incidence of diarrhea cases last December 2008 and January 2009
in Sitio Candiisan, Barangay Canayan was blamed on contaminated
drinking water or water from an unsanitary source. The CHO reported
that residents fetch water from a spring with unprotected source and
untreated with chlorine.

Sangalang said the number of cases is yet the biggest and first of
its scale in almost a decade in the city. He said 90 percent of the
city's villages have access to safe potable water. But the remaining
10 percent have "doubtful sources of water, including that in
Candiisan," he said.

[As previously pointed out by Mod.EP, it is unusual for amoebas to
cause waterborne outbreaks, and the posting does not mention why
infection with _E. histolytica_ is suspected. A waterborne outbreak
in an area with no access to clean water, as stated in the article,
would much more likely be caused by bacteria like that of cholera,
_Salmonella_, or pathogenic _E. coli_.

The area is located in Bukidnon province, a landlocked province of
the Philippines located in the Northern Mindanao region. It can be
found on a map at <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukidnon>.
