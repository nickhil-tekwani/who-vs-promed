In a follow-up to a report last month [March 2015], the number of cases of Ross River virus infections in Australia is heading toward record numbers in 2015 as health officials are reporting 6404 cases as of 25 Apr [2015]. This total is higher than any total year since 1997. Queensland is reporting 7 out of 10 of the total cases nationally with nearly 4500, by far more than any other State or Territory.

Ross River virus disease (RRVD) is a mosquitoborne virus. About 55-75 per cent of people who are infected do not feel sick, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). For those who do feel sick, symptoms of RRVD include joint pain and swelling, muscle pain, fever, tiredness, and rash. Most patients recover within a few weeks, but some people experience joint pain, joint stiffness or tiredness for many months.

RRVD infection cannot be spread from person to person. It is found throughout Australia, Papua New Guinea, parts of Indonesia and the western Pacific Islands.

[The number of RRVD cases continues to mount in Queensland, rising from 2835 cases reported in the state on 14 Mar 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150314.3230696), to 3292 reported on 27 Mar 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150328.3262332), and now nearly 4000 reported above.

Ross River virus is a zoonotic alphavirus transmitted by a wide range of mosquitoes including _Aedes_ and _Culex_ species. The recommendation to avoid mosquito bites is prudent and should be adopted by individuals living in or visiting these hot spots where transmission is occurring.
