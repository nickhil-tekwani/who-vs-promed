An anthrax epidemic in Shaanxi province, which infected 19 victims is under control, the Health and Family Planning Commission of Shaanxi province said, with all patients in a stable condition. As of [9 Aug 2015] evening, 18 of the 19 diagnosed in Ganquan county, Yan'an city, were receiving hospital treatment. The other patient, with mild symptoms, is being treated at home.

Anthrax is an acute disease caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Most forms of the disease are lethal, and it affects mostly animals.

Several mules have been reported to have died of unknown causes in the county's Yuanzhuang village and residents with suspected anthrax were sent to hospital, according to Yang Xiao, deputy mayor of Yan'an. To date 15 livestock, including mules, cattle and sheep are reported to have died in the village. "My brother had kept a mule which died and doctors said he might be infected by the animal," a patient's family member, said.

After the outbreak was reported, the provincial government sent experts and doctors, led by Ma Guanghui, director of Shaanxi Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, to the county, with 1000 doses of anthrax vaccine. According to Ma, his group inoculated 50 people who had been in close contact with infected livestock and people and disinfected 28 000 sq meters [about 301 400 sq ft] including animal pens, water sources, livestock slaughter points, and farms where livestock had died.

Experts from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, based in Beijing, joined prevention and control work and carried out epidemiological investigations, Ma said. "The investigation covered 122 people and we also gave anthrax prevention lectures on local TV programs," Ma said.

Liu Feng, deputy director of the provincial disease control center, said the best way to prevent infection was to avoid contact with sources of the illness and livestock that have died of the disease must not be eaten.

[On 7 Aug 2015, Chinese government officials said there have been reports of anthrax in horses in 3 villages and 11 suspected human cases; it was also reported that 15 livestock died due to anthrax in north west China's Shaanxi province. (http://outbreaknewstoday.com/anthrax-outbreak-reported-in-northwest-china-22862/.)

Ganquan County Provincial Planning Commission quickly organized the disease prevention and control and clinical experts, to carry out epidemiological investigation and medical observation, medical personnel professional training, as well as emergency allocation of 1000 doses of anthrax vaccine. The epidemic has been effectively controlled after provincial, city, and county health departments worked together to take effective prevention and control measures for patients with standardized treatment. Yan'an City and Ganquan County Government issued and started the anthrax epidemic emergency response plan http://www.chinesedishes.tk/archives/39425.

Herbivorous animals are highly susceptible to anthrax, while carnivorous birds and reptiles are resistant. In livestock, the disease is usually acute, and occurs in cattle, sheep, goats, horses, and mules. In swine and dogs, anthrax generally occurs in a less acute form.

Anthrax primarily occurs in alkaline soils with high nitrogen levels caused by decaying vegetation, alternating periods of rain and drought, and temperatures in excess of 60 deg F (15.6 deg C). Anthrax spores are highly resistant to disinfectants and the weather and may remain viable in the soil for as many as 50 years.

Treatment of anthrax with hyperimmune serum, developed in various animal species, predates antibiotics by several decades. It was considered effective and is still an available treatment in China and the Russian Federation. To prevent further outbreaks of the disease, immunization and epidemiological investigation need to be reinforced. Effective surveillance is essential for prevention and control programmes for anthrax.
