The first case of arthritis was detected on August 11, 1997 in a premature
child. Till March 30, 1998 a total of 21 cases of arthritis were recorded
among newborns. Most of the cases were preterm babies with birth weight of
less than 2.5 kg, except for three children.

The monthly distribution was as follows:

October 4
November 4
Dec 3
Jan 1
Feb 5
The staff members working in the Nursery were affected as follows:
Sept 1
Oct 1
Jan 1
Feb 5
Mar 1
[The majority were Registrars and Nurses who spent maximum time in the
nursery. Only one person was working outside the nursery.
Cultures from synovial fluids showed _Staphylococcus aureus_ in some and
_Candida_ sp. in some others. Initially, treatment was being given with
broad spectrum antibiotics, then vancomycin, and subsequently with
amphotericin B. All children improved over the period of observation except
one child who died of ?meningitis. One child improved without any
antibiotics. Till last examination no permanent joint damage was observed.
The nursery was closed in March 1998. Though cases were seen in March also
no new cases have been reported after that. No new staff member has been
infected. All the staff members affected have recovered without any
sequelae.
Other investigations included serological tests, synovial fluid tests,
throat swabs, stool examination, cannula and IV fluid cultures, and tests
for water samples from the nursery .
The serum from staff showed higher titres of Coxsackie B4 virus in one
laboratory while another laboratory did not find it significant. Similarly
parvovirus 19 was also found negative in some of the sera tested.
Since the epidemic has stopped it is assumed that the transmission chain is
broken. The exact agent is not yet clear though both [a parvovirus and [a
Coxsackie B virus seemed to fit the case descriptions.

[The meaning of "higher titres of Coxsackie B4 virus" and "parvovirus 19
was also found negative in some of the sera tested" are not clear. No
information provided as to signs and symptoms in the adult patients. I am
assuming that virus isolation assays were done and that is what was meant
by "high titre". Can't fulfill Koch's postulates, as always, but if the
coxsackie B4 titers were high and the parvovirus tests negative, what is
the diagnostic question. Looks like a coxsackie B4 outbreak to me. -
