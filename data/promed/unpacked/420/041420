Abstract
--------
Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease endemic in Central and West Africa. In May 2022, dozens of non-endemic countries reported hundreds of monkeypox cases, most with no epidemiological link to Africa. We identified 2 lineages of monkeypox virus (MPXV) among nine 2021 and 2022 US monkeypox cases. A 2021 case was highly similar to the 2022 MPXV outbreak variant, suggesting a common ancestor. Analysis of mutations among these 2 lineages revealed an extreme preference for GA-to-AA mutations indicative of APOBEC3 cytosine deaminase activity that was shared among West African MPXV since 2017 but absent from Congo Basin lineages. Poxviruses are not thought to be subject to APOBEC3 editing; however, these findings suggest APOBEC3 activity has been recurrent and dominant in recent West African MPXV evolution.

[3] Israel community spread
Date: Mon 20 Jun 2022

https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-confirms-first-communal-spread-of-monkeypox/


The Health Ministry on Monday [20 Jun 2022] announced 3 new monkeypox cases, including the first confirmed instance of community spread in Israel. According to a ministry statement, the 3 cases were all among men from central Israel, aged between 30 and 60.

The ministry gave no further details about the case of the man infected in Israel nor specify in which countries the other 2 men were believed to have contracted monkeypox. With the new diagnoses, there have been a total of 9 cases of the rare disease confirmed in Israel. The first case was confirmed on 20 May [2022].

"The Health Ministry notes that anyone who develops a fever or blistering after returning from overseas or was in close contact with someone suspected of being sick with monkeypox should speak to a doctor," the Health Ministry statement said. Israeli health officials have played down the risk of the virus, with a top health official urging calm in a briefing last month [May 2022] and saying the recent cases were not a major risk to public health.

[4] Virus name change, comment
Date: Mon 20 Jun 2022
From: Francisco Murilo Zerbini <zerbini@ufv.br> [edited]


This is in reference to Professor Thomas Yuill's comment on item 13 (WHO: virus name change) of ProMed's post PRO/AH/EDR> Monkeypox update (14): "It is curious that no mention was made for coordination with the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). The ICTV is the internationally recognized organization that is responsible for naming viruses. - Mod.TY"

Actually, the ICTV has no mandate on virus names. We are responsible for classifying viruses and naming taxa, including species. The important distinction here (which is almost always lost in news media reports) is between virus (the agent that replicates in cells and often makes us sick) and species (an abstract concept of the human mind). What is being discussed by the World Health Organization is a change in the virus name (although what was urged in the <Virological.org> article was a change in the strain/clade names, "West African" and "Central African" or "Congo Basin", not in the virus name, monkeypox virus). The ICTV could be part of this discussion (and it is quite possible that some members of the Poxviridae study group of the ICTV are part of it) but does not necessarily have to be. On the other hand, a change in the species name can be done only by submission of a taxonomy proposal to the ICTV, which would be discussed and voted by the executive committee (anyone can submit a taxonomy proposal).

As a side comment, it is an unfortunate coincidence that the species name of monkeypox virus is . . . _Monkeypox virus_ (the only difference being the way it is written, with the 1st letter capitalized and in italics). This was one of the reasons why the ICTV decided to adopt a Latinized binomial nomenclature for virus species (equal to the one used for all other organisms) since 2020. All newly classified species must now have binomial names, and existing names must be changed until July 2023. So the species name _Monkeypox virus_ will be changed soon. This does not affect the virus name. The ICTV EC has just published a paper explaining this change and when/how to use virus names and species names (Zerbini F M, Siddell S G, Mushegian A R, et al. Differentiating between viruses and virus species by writing their names correctly. Arch Virol. 2022; 167: 1231-1234; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00705-021-05323-4).

[Professor Zerbini is thanked for his comments and clarification of the role of the ICTV in standardizing virus taxonomy. One would hope that the ICTV Poxviridae study group would be a part of the discussion for the submission of a taxonomy proposal to the ICTV. The change of the _Monkeypox virus_ species name is awaited with interest.

As for naming of clades, WHO says it has removed the distinction between endemic and non-endemic countries in its data on monkeypox to better unify the response to the virus. Until the past few months, monkeypox had generally been confined to Western and Central Africa but is now present in several continents. "We are removing the distinction between endemic and non-endemic countries, reporting on countries together where possible, to reflect the unified response that is needed," the WHO said in its outbreak situation update dated 17 Jun [2022] but sent to media on Sat 18 Jun 2022 (https://medicalxpress.com/news/2022-06-endemic-country-distinction-monkeypox.html). - Mod.TY]

[5] Social gatherings, safer sex, and monkeypox
Source: CDC [edited]
https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/pdf/MPX_Social_Gatherings_Safer_Sex-508.pdf


Monkeypox is a disease caused by a virus not commonly seen in the United States. While we work to contain the current outbreak and study the virus, we want you to have information so you can make informed choices when you are in spaces or situations where monkeypox could be spread through close, intimate contact or during sex. There is a lot we still need to learn about monkeypox, and we will update this information as we learn more on <www.cdc.gov/monkeypox>.

What is monkeypox?
Monkeypox is a disease that can make you sick, including a rash, which may look like pimples or blisters, often with an earlier flu-like illness. Monkeypox can spread to anyone through close, personal, often skin-to-skin contact including
- direct contact with monkeypox rash, sores, or scabs from a person with monkeypox. We believe this is currently the most common way that monkeypox is spreading in the USA;
- contact with objects, fabrics (clothing, bedding, or towels), and surfaces that have been used by someone with monkeypox;
- contact with respiratory secretions, through kissing and other face-to-face contact.

This contact can happen when you have sex including
- oral, anal, and vaginal sex or touching the genitals (penis, testicles, labia, and vagina) or anus (butt) of a person with monkeypox;
- hugging, massage, and kissing;
- touching fabrics and objects during sex that were used by a person with monkeypox and that have not been disinfected, such as bedding, towels, fetish gear, and sex toys.

What are the symptoms of monkeypox?
Monkeypox symptoms usually start within 2 weeks of exposure to the virus.
- The 1st symptoms might be like the flu, such as fever, headache, muscle aches and backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills, or exhaustion.
- Within 1-3 days of these symptoms beginning, people develop a rash or sores.

The rash or sores may be located on or near the genitals or anus but could also be on other areas like the hands, feet, chest, or face.
- The sores will go through several stages, including scabs, before healing.
- The sores can look like pimples or blisters and may be painful or itchy.
- Sores may be inside the body, including the mouth, vagina, or anus.

You may experience all or only a few of these symptoms. Most people with monkeypox will get the rash or sores. Some people have reported developing the rash or sores before (or without) the flu-like symptoms.

Monkeypox can be spread from the time symptoms start until all sores, including scabs, have healed and a fresh layer of skin has formed. This can take several weeks.

What are researchers investigating?
- If the virus can be spread when someone has no symptoms.
- If the virus could be present in semen (cum), vaginal fluids, and fecal matter (poop).

How can a person lower the chance of getting monkeypox at places like raves, parties, clubs, and festivals?
When thinking about what to do, seek out information from trusted sources like the local health department. Second, consider how much close, personal, skin-to-skin contact is likely to occur at the event you plan to attend. If you feel sick or have any rashes or sores, do not attend any gathering, and see a healthcare provider.
- Festivals, events, and concerts where attendees are fully clothed and unlikely to share skin-to-skin contact are safer. However, attendees should be mindful of activities (like kissing) that might spread monkeypox.
- A rave, party, or club where there is minimal clothing and where there is direct, personal, often skin-to-skin contact has some risk. Avoid any rashes or sores you see on others and consider minimizing skin-to-skin contact when possible.
- Enclosed spaces, such as back rooms, saunas, or sex clubs, where there is minimal or no clothing and where intimate sexual contact occurs, have a higher likelihood of spreading monkeypox.

How can a person lower their risk during sex?
Talk to your partner about any recent illness and be aware of new or unexplained sores or rashes on your body or your partner's body, including the genitals and anus. If you or your partner have recently been sick, currently feel sick, or have a new or an unexplained rash or sores, do not have sex and see a healthcare provider. This is always a good plan, even if monkeypox isn't in your area.

If you or a partner has monkeypox, the best way to protect yourself and others is to not have sex of any kind (oral, anal, vaginal) and not kiss or touch each other's bodies while you are sick, especially any rash or sores. Do not share things like towels, fetish gear, sex toys, and toothbrushes.

If you or your partner have (or think you might have) monkeypox and you decide to have sex, consider the following to reduce the chance of spreading the virus:
- Have virtual sex with no in-person contact.
- Masturbate together at a distance of at least 6 feet [almost 2m], without touching each other and without touching any rash or sores.
- Consider having sex with your clothes on or covering areas where rash or sores are present, reducing as much skin-to-skin contact as possible.
- Avoid kissing.
- Remember to wash your hands, fetish gear, sex toys and any fabrics (bedding, towels, clothing) after having sex.
- Limit your number of partners to avoid opportunities for monkeypox to spread.

What should a person do if they have a new or unexplained rash, sores, or other symptoms?
- Avoid sex or being intimate with anyone until you have been checked out by a healthcare provider. If you don't have a provider or health insurance, visit a public health clinic near you.
- When you see a healthcare provider, remind them that this virus is circulating in the area.
- Avoid gatherings, especially if they involve close, personal, skin-to-skin contact.
- Think about the people you have had close, personal, or sexual contact within the last 21 days, including people you met through dating apps. You might be asked to share this information if you have received a monkeypox diagnosis, to help stop the spread.

https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dls/locs/2022/06-13-2022-lab-advisory-cdc_publishes_monkeypox_virus_pcr_testing_procedure.html


Laboratory advisory
---------------
On 6 Jun 2022, CDC published a real-time PCR test procedure to detect monkeypox virus. This procedure is intended for international partners and any laboratories interested in pursuing a laboratory developed test (LDT). This procedure includes sequence information for primer and probe development and cycling conditions. This assay is designed to specifically detect monkeypox virus.

Public health laboratories have capacity for the current testing demand. Laboratories with specimens that are suspected to contain monkeypox virus should contact their state or territorial public health department (contact list) as soon as possible. Please refer to the CDC Specimen Collection Guidelines for Monkeypox virus (https://bit.ly/3OdUVRs) for more information.

[7] Transmission patterns
Date: Mon 20 Jun 2022
Source: Science [edited]
https://www.science.org/content/article/monkeypox-outbreak-mostly-affecting-men-sex-men


Ever since monkeypox started to sicken thousands of people worldwide this spring, 2 big questions have loomed: Why is a virus that has never managed to spread beyond a few cases outside Africa suddenly causing such a big, global outbreak? And why are the overwhelming majority of those affected men who have sex with men (MSM)?

A long history of work on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and early studies of the current outbreak suggest the answers may be linked: The virus may have made its way into highly interconnected sexual networks within the MSM community, where it can spread in ways that it cannot in the general population.

An epidemiological modeling study posted as a preprint last week [see citation below] by researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) supports that idea. It suggests the outbreak will keep growing rapidly if the spread isn't curtailed. It also has implications for how to protect those most at risk and limit spread, while suggesting the risk for the wider population remains low.

But there are still many uncertainties, and communication is fraught because of the risk of stigmatizing MSM, and because communicating frankly about sexual behavior is hard. "I think we have to talk more about sex," says Yale School of Public Health epidemiologist and former HIV activist Gregg Gonsalves. "Everybody has been very clear about stigma, and saying it over and over again. The point is that you still have to address the risk of infection in our community."

Since early May [2022], more than 2000 monkeypox cases have been reported in more than 30 countries where the virus is not normally seen. (Outbreaks are more common in at least a dozen countries in West and Central Africa, where the virus has animal reservoirs. More than 60 cases and one death have been confirmed there this year [2022].)

The vast majority of cases in the current outbreak have been in MSM. Researchers at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA), for example, asked patients to fill out questionnaires. Of 152 who did, 151 said they were MSM, the team wrote in a technical briefing published on 10 Jun [2022]; the remaining patient refused to answer. Other countries have seen similar patterns.

That could be a skewed picture, of course. "MSM have a better relationship with medical practitioners than heterosexual men," says Lilith Whittles, an infectious disease modeler at Imperial College London, which could mean they are more likely to report monkeypox symptoms and get tested for the virus. "I don't know that we're necessarily looking enough in heterosexual social networks to make the conclusion that this is not a broader problem," says Boghuma Titanji, a virologist at Emory University who works at a sexual health clinic.

But most researchers say such "ascertainment bias" is unlikely to explain the striking pattern. Although some monkeypox patients have mild infections that may be missed or misdiagnosed, others have very characteristic rashes and agonizing pains that require hospitalization for pain treatment. If many people outside the MSM community had monkeypox, more would have shown up in the statistics by now.

Ashleigh Tuite, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, says she "understands the hesitation" to focus on MSM, given the risk of stigma that could worsen discrimination and cause those who are affected to delay seeking care. "But based on the data that we have, and based on the contact tracing that's been done, it's very clear that this is an MSM-focused outbreak at this point," she says. "Anyone can get monkeypox, but we're seeing disease activity primarily among" MSM, confirms Demetre Daskalakis, an HIV prevention specialist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Sexual encounters clearly play a role in transmission. Of the 152 people in the UKHSA data set, 82 were invited for additional interviews focusing on their sexual health. Among the 45 who participated, 44% reported more than 10 sexual partners in the previous 3 months, and 44% reported group sex during the incubation period. Exactly how the virus is passed on is less clear. Researchers have found viral DNA, and even infectious virus, in the semen of some patients, but they aren't sure that is important for transmission; skin-to-skin contact may be enough. (Other STIs, including herpes and scabies, also primarily spread this way.)

To those who study how pathogens spread through social and sexual networks, the pattern is not a big surprise. In the 1970s and 80s, researchers trying to understand the spread of sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea were stumped, says LSHTM epidemiologist Adam Kucharski: Survey data showed people's average numbers of sexual partners were too low to sustain transmission. But averages obscured that although many people have few sexual partners, some have large numbers. This helps drive transmission because, if infected, they are also more likely to infect others.

Sexual networks among MSM are not different in nature from those of other groups, Whittles stresses, but a core group of people are much more densely connected than people outside the MSM community. They change partners more frequently and are more likely to have several partners at the same time. "These things occur in all sexual networks; it is just a question of the degree," Whittles says. And in a densely connected network, the virus is less likely to hit a dead-end.

"It's entirely possible for this epidemic to rage among a subset of people just because that subset is connected in a network differently than everyone else," says Keletso Makofane, a social network epidemiologist at the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights at Harvard University. Together with colleagues, Makofane hopes to launch a study in New York City in August [2022] to better understand the spread of the disease. "The idea is to get a sense of how many people report symptoms that are consistent with monkeypox and how they are connected," he says.

The LSHTM study, posted on medRxiv on 13 Jun [2022], used UK data about sexual partnership patterns to model the spread of monkeypox among MSM and outside that group. Because it is not yet clear how contagious the virus is, the researchers modeled scenarios based on different risk levels. Without effective intervention measures or behavioral changes, a large and sustained outbreak with more than 10 000 cases among MSM globally is "highly likely," they write. "In contrast, sustained transmission in the non-MSM population is unlikely in all scenarios considered."

Because the model is based on UK data, the findings may not apply elsewhere, first author Akira Endo says. And other factors may have made the outbreak worse. Monkeypox may have mutated in ways that allow it to transmit more easily, and the share of the population who have had the smallpox vaccine -- which also offers some protection against monkeypox -- is declining because smallpox vaccination was abandoned worldwide starting in the 1970s. But the modeling shows "we do not necessarily need [those factors] to explain the observed patterns".

Such conclusions put epidemiologists in a delicate position, and some declined to talk to Science for fear of stigmatizing MSM. Endo says he understands that and agrees the findings could easily be misunderstood. "Meanwhile, I also understand that there's a risk in the other direction, that the information doesn't reach those who need it most before it's too late," he says. Whittles agrees, calling the findings "practical information, in terms of where it's spreading. It is a morally neutral thing," she says. "Knowledge of what's happening is power, even though that knowledge is imperfect and will change," Daskalakis adds.

The virus could still find other networks with similar characteristics. Daskalakis recalls a US outbreak of methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_ in the 2000s that started in the MSM community but later spread in gyms, among athletes, and in prisons. Monkeypox could also start to spread among sex workers and their clients, Tuite says.

How fast the virus will spread in the months ahead depends on control efforts. National health authorities in Europe, Canada, and the United States have issued guidance about how to reduce the risk of infection, and dating apps have alerted users to the risk of monkeypox and to its symptoms, which may change contact patterns. Increasing awareness among health-care workers may have an impact as well, Whittles says: faster diagnoses mean patients will isolate sooner in their infection, reducing onward transmission. "So there's a couple of different ways that behavior can change, even if it's not people having less sex," she says. And the model did not account for infected individuals developing immunity. That means "we may see a slowdown of the outbreak earlier than we might imagine," Endo says.

Many countries are also gearing up to start immunization campaigns. Targeting those with many sexual partners may be the most efficient approach. In new guidance published on 21 Jun [2022], UKHSA announced it would start to offer vaccines to MSM at highest risk: "Risk criteria would include a recent history of multiple partners, participating in group sex, attending sex on premises venues, or a proxy marker such as recent bacterial STI (in the past year)."

It's important to alert that community and do it the right way, Gonsalves says. "We should say: It's not about who you are. It's about what you're doing. And we're not going to stigmatize it. But just know that you're at greater risk if you fit this profile."
