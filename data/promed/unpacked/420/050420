Epidemiological comments: On 31 May 2013, LPAI H7 was detected in samples collected in connection with the Danish surveillance programme for avian influenza. The farm is divided into 2 isolated units. One unit consisted of 4906 mallards (offspring and adult mallards), 196 hens and 16 geese. On 2 Jun 2013, the 5118 birds in that unit were killed and destroyed. In total 15 016 hatching eggs were also destroyed. The other unit consists of 17 000 pheasants, 60 ornamental ducks, 25 partridges and 12 ornamental pheasants. Those birds are under official surveillance and will be tested 3 times during a period of 21 days.

The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration has established a 1 km restricted zone around the farm and has implemented the measures in accordance with Council directive 2005/94/EC.

[The following note, by the OIE Animal Health Information Department, was included in the epidemiological comments: "H5 and H7 avian influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2012)."

It will be interesting to note if measures have been considered/undertaken to address the potential zoonotic aspects of the described H7 event. (Biosecurity? Serological follow-up in human contacts?)

During 2013, LPAI virus strains have been identified also in poultry in Germany (H7N7) and Netherlands (H7N7, H7N1). - Mod.AS
