The La Plata County man who died on 6 Apr [2015] of a hantavirus infection was identified on Mon 13 Apr 2015 as a 36-year-old resident of Hesperus, said La Plata County Coroner Jann Smith. The family declined to comment for this story.

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment confirmed Friday [10 Apr 2015] that a La Plata County resident died after becoming infected with a hantavirus that causes a rare but often deadly disease carried by deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_].

It is the 2nd confirmed case of a hantavirus infection in the state this year [2015]. In both 2015 cases, the disease was fatal.

Public health officials have not released details about the circumstances under which the La Plata County resident became infected.

Hantaviruses are largely rural viruses carried by rodents that are spread to humans through droppings. People are typically exposed when they go into places such as cabins or woodpiles, stirring up rodent nests. There is no cure for hantavirus infection.

To prevent infection, residents should ventilate areas that might be infested with mice for a week before cleaning, ensure they're exposed to virus-killing sunlight, and soak anything that needs cleaning with a bleach mixture or a household disinfectant for at least 10 minutes, said Jennifer House, state public health veterinarian. After that, clean up the mixture wearing gloves and a mask, she said.

Symptoms typically start 1-6 weeks after exposure, with fever, body aches, headache and vomiting.

[This report provides confirmation of the cause of death of the case posted on 11 Apr 2015 (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20150412.3293370). Although not stated in the report above, the specific hantavirus involved in this and the previous hantavirus pulmonary syndrome case probably is Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in deer mice (_Peromyscus maniculatus_) in Colorado. This report indicates the sex (male) and age (36 years) of the patient not provided in the original report but not the environmental setting in La Plata County where the infection was acquired.
