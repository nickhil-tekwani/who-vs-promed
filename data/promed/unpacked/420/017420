The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease dated Tue 7 Aug 2018:
- A total of 44 cases of haemorrhagic fever were reported in the region, of which 17 confirmed and 27 probable;
- 47 suspected cases are under investigation;
- 1 new case confirmed to Beni.

News from the Ebola response
- Exactly one week after the declaration of the epidemic, vaccination will begin in North Kivu. On Wed 8 Aug 2018, the minister of health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, visited the health area of Mangina, the epicenter of the epidemic, located about 30 km [18.6 mi] from the city of Beni, in the province of North Kivu, to launch vaccination activities.
- The provincial minister of health and the provincial coordinator of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) were the 1st 2 volunteers to be vaccinated. For the provincial minister of health, Dr Martial Kambumbu Kayenga, this symbolic gesture was very important to reassure the inhabitants of this locality who had come in large numbers to attend the launching ceremony.
- On the list of people to be vaccinated today [Wed 8 Aug 2018] were front-line health professionals from the Mangina Reference Health Center who had been in contact with confirmed cases and identified 1st contacts.
- Immunization activities were initiated by Congolese EPI vaccinators who had been trained by Guinean vaccinators during the previous outbreak in Equateur Province. However, several teams of Guinean experts will return to the DR Congo to provide support to local experts.
- This is the 2nd vaccination in response to an Ebola outbreak in the DR Congo this year. The 1st ring vaccination campaign took place in Equateur province from May to June 2018. A total of 3481 people were vaccinated, and none of them developed the Ebola virus.

[2] Vaccination
Wed 8 Aug 2018 - Ebola vaccination begins in North Kivu
DRC MOH - WHO joint press release [edited]
https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/ebola-vaccination-begins-north-kivu


The Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) today announced the start of vaccination among high-risk populations in North Kivu province. The current vaccination began just one week after the announcement of a 2nd Ebola outbreak in the country. To date, 44 cases have been registered, of which 17 are confirmed.

Work with the communities had already begun several days ago to prepare for the vaccination of affected populations in the Mangina health area, 30 km [18.6 mi] from the city of Beni.

The provincial minister of health and the provincial coordinator of the Expanded Program of Immunization were the 1st 2 people to be vaccinated to reassure the population. Next vaccinated was the front-line health professionals at the Mangina Reference Health Center who had been in contact with the confirmed cases. "Vaccination is an important component in the fight against Ebola. This is why vaccines have been prioritized and moved rapidly into place to protect health workers and the public," said Dr Oly Ilunga, the health minister of the DRC.

A total of 3220 doses of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine are currently available in the country. An agreement between the Gavi Alliance and Merck (which developed the vaccine) provides for additional doses of the vaccine, used as an experiment, to be available.

"Once again, the DRC has demonstrated strong leadership in the rapid response to this epidemic," said Dr Tedros, the director-general of the World Health Organization. "The Ebola virus disease is aggressive. We must respond with force. Introducing immunization so quickly is one of the main tools at the beginning of the response."

WHO provided logistical support to establish the cold chain conditions and equipment needed to carry out the vaccination. In addition, WHO facilitates consultations on protocols to be put in place as well as discussions with the vaccine manufacturer and national authorities. Finally, WHO is contributing to the deployment of Guinea's vaccination expert teams to work alongside Congolese vaccinators who have already started immunization activities.

"We are proud of the solidarity shown at the regional level in the immunization efforts, and we are confident that the African region will once again demonstrate the strong capabilities it has in responding to this outbreak," said. Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa.

[...Given the limited number of available doses of the Merck vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV -- 3220 in the DRC and some 20 000 in the USA -- an "outside-in" strategy of vaccinating a whole geographical zone rather than targeting known contacts is probably not feasible in the near-term. - Mod.LXL]

[3] Safe burials
Tue 7 Aug 2018. DRC-Ebola: ICRC and Red Cross team in Beni for "safe" burials of victims [actualite.CD., machine trans., edited]
https://actualite.cd/2018/08/07/rdc-ebola-cicr-et-une-equipe-de-la-croix-rouge-a-beni-pour-les-inhumations-sans-risque-des-victimes/


A team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the Red Cross of the DRC, and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies arrived in Beni (North Kivu) on Tue 7 Aug 2018 to contribute to the response to the reported Ebola outbreak in the locality of Mangina. Comprised of 19 members, the multidisciplinary team will notably facilitate the safe burials of the victims of the disease. Some members of the team contributed to the eradication of the Ebola epidemic a few weeks ago in Equateur province (West).

"The Ebola virus is the most contagious just after the death of the sick. It is therefore essential, in order to stop its spread, to follow security procedures for the management of human remains in case of suspicion of Ebola. But for this approach to work, it needs to be adapted to local cultural beliefs and norms, which means engaging with communities and gaining their trust. This crucial process will be one of the priorities of the Red Cross teams," said Dr Fatoumata Nafo-Traore, regional director of the International Federation for Africa, in a statement released on Tuesday [7 Aug 2018].

The epidemiological situation of the disease as of Sun 5 Aug 2018 is 43 cases of haemorrhagic fever reported in the region, of which 16 are confirmed and 27 probable, and 4 new deaths of confirmed cases in Mabalako.

The ICRC regrets that this disease adds to the problem of insecurity in this part of the country. "The people of northern North Kivu province have already experienced the effects of armed conflict for years. We are very concerned about the devastating impact that an Ebola outbreak could have on these fragile communities," said Nicolas Lambert, deputy head of the ICRC delegation in the DRC.

According to the authorities, this 10th epidemic has already killed at least 33 people since last May [2018]. Health authorities have announced the start of Ebola vaccination in Beni on Wednesday [8 Aug 2018]. The operation will initially concern the nursing staff.

[4] Security issues
- Wed 8 Aug 2018. Congo turmoil means Ebola vaccinators will need armed escorts, experts warn.
[The Guardian, excerpted, edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/aug/08/congo-turmoil-ebola-vaccinators-will-need-armed-escorts-world-health-organization-warn


Armed escorts will be required to protect vaccination teams as they battle to contain Ebola in the DRC, WHO has warned. The Ebola outbreak area in North Kivu province, classified as a level-4 security threat by WHO -- one of the highest set by the UN -- comes amid local unrest, including violence between rival militia groups. The turmoil poses major challenges for those tasked with locating and vaccinating people who may have come into contact with Ebola victims.

"Even though we have access to the towns of Mangini and Beni, we don't know to what extent we will be able to rely on armed escorts for broader contact tracing outside those small towns. That's going to be a critical determining factor in our ability to respond," said spokesman Tarik Jasarevic.

So far there have been 43 cases, of which 16 are confirmed; 34 people have died. The cost of the response, said WHO, "is likely to be significant."

The UN peacekeeping force in DRC, which has more than 20 000 personnel, is already playing a key role, while the WHO, UNICEF, the World Food Programme, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders) also have people in Kinshasa or the area of the outbreak.

- Wed 8 Aug 2018, corrected Thu 9 Aug 2018. War zone complicates roll-out of Ebola vaccine in latest outbreak
[Nature magazine, excerpted and edited]
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05921-4


Aid workers in the DRC began giving an experimental Ebola vaccine to health workers on [Wed 8 Aug 2018, one week after WHO declared an outbreak of the virus. 1st responders and public-health staff are scrambling to contain the outbreak while planning how to roll out the vaccine to communities in the middle of a conflict zone.

The virus is spreading in North Kivu and Ituri, in the east of the DRC. As of Tue 7 Aug 2018, 44 people had shown symptoms of Ebola, including 36 who had died. But violence perpetuated by more than 100 armed groups fighting over resources and power in those lush, green provinces has escalated this year in advance of the country's presidential election scheduled for December [2018]. This is the nation's 10th Ebola outbreak since 1976, but it is the 1st in this tumultuous eastern region.

"The situation is volatile," says Ibrahima Soce-Fall, director of the WHO's operations in Africa, based in Brazzaville in the neighbouring Republic of Congo. Even so, researchers are also gearing up to give people with Ebola experimental antibody and antiviral drugs in addition to the vaccine.

Soce-Fall says that at least 2000 doses of the experimental vaccine, called rVSV-ZEBOV, remain in the country from the most recent Ebola outbreak, which ended in July [2018], and more doses are on the way. The DRC will need a larger vaccine supply now because the strategy deployed during the previous outbreak will not work for the current one. That last outbreak, which hit western DRC, lasted 3 months.

During the previous outbreak, officials vaccinated health workers, people who had direct contact with someone with Ebola, and the contacts of those contacts. But the instability in North Kivu and Ituri has made tracking such connections difficult. In towns where people have been infected but officials can't track down their contacts, workers might vaccinate the entire community instead, says Soce-Fall.

An inability to track these connections worries epidemiologists, because the virus spreads through people on the move. Humanitarian groups estimate that nearly 750 000 people in North Kivu and Ituri have fled this year from militia fighters who maim and rape people and burn villages to the ground. And about one million refugees who have been displaced from their homes by fighting over at least the past decade continue to travel frequently between cities in the region. Some refugees migrate through the porous borders of neighbouring countries such as Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi.

Aid agencies must now figure out how to get into these conflict zones to fight Ebola without endangering their staff. Workers might travel with armed security escorts provided by the DRC government for their protection, said Peter Salama, WHO's head of emergency preparedness and response, at a press briefing on [Fri 3 Aug 2018].

But a key organization fighting Ebola in the area, MSF, hesitates to use that approach. The group feels that travelling with armed escorts hinders their ability to help people of various political affiliations, says Salha Issoufou, the head of MSF's operation in DRC. So MSF will forgo the escorts.

[Not only Ebola vaccinators, but all epidemiological personnel including contact tracers and safe burial teams, may need armed escorts. This will add layers of logistical issues, because obviously these functions do not occur simultaneously in a given locale, necessitating more armed escort teams and/or longer-term security deployments. How will security forces react if attacked by armed insurgents? Are supplies and equipment (for example, for vaccination) as well as personnel at risk of kidnapping? What if Ebola spreads into one of the many shadowy Congolese insurgent groups well-accustomed to hiding from government authorities? Many unprecedented scenarios, some horrific to contemplate, could arise from the present juxtaposition of a lethal outbreak and armed insurgencies. - Mod.LXL]

[5] EBOV genome
Wed 8 Aug 2018. INRB-USAMRIID statement on availability of current North Kivu EBOV genome sequences
Submitted directly to ProMED-mail by Steve Ahuka <amstev04@yahoo.fr>, National Institute of Biomedical Research, Kinshasa, DR Congo [edited]


From 8 May to 25 Jul 2018, the DRC faced its 9th Ebola outbreak, which affected 54 people, including 33 deaths in the health zones of Bikoro, Iboko, and Wangata, in the Province of Equateur. Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB), in collaboration with its partners, deployed 3 mobile laboratories on the 3 affected sites (Mbandaka, Bikoro, and Itipo) to contribute quickly and efficiently to control this epidemic. A total of 432 samples were collected from these 3 laboratories, of which 51 were positive in real-time RT-PCR. These came from the 38 confirmed cases for the whole period of the epidemic (8 May- 25 Jul 2018). On Tue 10 Jul 2018, samples from the mobile laboratories arrived at INRB, and processing of samples and sequencing began. Thus far, 23 samples have been processed, yielding 15 coding-complete genomes that will be released shortly on GenBank as well. Initial phylogenetic analysis indicates these genomes are closest to the 2014 DRC outbreak. Further analysis will need to be conducted on these preliminary findings, as the main focus is to finish processing available samples from the outbreak. Results will be made available as soon as they are generated.

Unfortunately, on Wed 1 Aug 2018, a new cluster of cases was discovered in the region of North Kivu and confirmed at INRB. Samples were prepared for sequencing at INRB. Two full genome sequences were obtained. The data confirms that the current EVD cases in Nord Kivu (30 Jul and ongoing) are caused by an EBOV strain distinct from the one that caused the outbreak in Equateur province. Based on this finding, although both events are caused by the same ebolavirus species (EBOV), the outbreaks appear not to be connected. On that basis, the available vaccine should work against the new strain.

Partners and collaborators
This work is part of ongoing research collaborations between several partners:
Institut National de Recherche Biomedicale (INRB);
US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID);
Institut Pasteur de Dakar, Dakar, Senegal (IPD);
TransVIHMI (IRD, INSERM, University of Montpellier).

Data availability
Genome sequences for all samples had been shared with all local and international partners working in the DRC. The information reported here is being shared pre-publication to help the research and public-health communities respond to the current Ebola virus disease outbreak. Please note, though, that this data is still based on work in progress and should be considered preliminary. Our analysis of this data is ongoing, and a publication communicating our findings is in preparation. INRB will distribute these data to any entity or collaborator that needs it. Please communicate with Drs Muyembe-Tamfum and Ahuka for further coordination.
