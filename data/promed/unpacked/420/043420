FOODBORNE OUTBREAK - ITALY (TURIN) (03)
=======================================

More from M. Tarditi in Turin. Surprisingly, I haven't seen anything in US
newspapers about this, and the online version of Turin's La Stampa only has
an indignant editorial along the lines of "someone must be held accountable."
Update of May 23 12:00 a.m.
"About the foodborne outbreak of May 21: Perhaps the agent is a mycotoxin
(vomitoxin) produced by _Fusarium_ spp. in canned sweet-corn. This is
probable because many childrens accused [showed] neurological symptoms
(hallucination, chill/tremor), after first symptoms (vomiting, nausea, fever).
Canned sweet-corn is produced in Italy.
Chemical analyses are now in progress at ARPA Piemonte (environmental
regional protection agency), searching for all detectable mycotoxins. A
total of about 1300 children of Moncalieri, 130 from Giaveno (including 23
from Chernobyl hosted by local people), and 15 students in Turin's University
college have been concerned [exposed? involved?]. A few are in hospital now.
As of today there is no other report of outbreak due to consumption of the
same product at home or in other services.
Please, wait for more information."
