Highly pathogenic avian influenza, Japan
------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 12 Jan 2018 from Dr Kazuo Ito, Director, International Animal Health Affairs Office, Animal Health Division, Food Safety and Consumer Affairs Bureau, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo, Japan

Report type: Immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 10 Jan 2018
Date of confirmation of the event: 12 Jan 2018
Report date: 12 Jan 2018
Date submitted to OIE: 12 Jan 2018
Reason for notification: Recurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 27 Mar 2017
Manifestation of disease: Clinical disease
Causal agent: Highly pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5N6
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, Laboratory (basic), Laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country.

New outbreaks (1)
Outbreak 1: Sanuki-shi, Kagawa
Date of start of the outbreak: 10 Jan 2018
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Birds / 51 000 / 55 / 55 / - / 0
Affected population: Poultry (broilers)

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: Unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: On [10 Jan 2018], the local veterinary service in Kagawa Prefecture received a notification from a domestic broilers farm on an increase in the number of dead birds (55 birds on the same day). The samples were sent to the laboratory of the local veterinary service (Tobu Livestock Hygiene Service Centre), and the samples from dead birds and live birds were confirmed as avian influenza virus positive by antigen-capture kits. On 11 Jan 2018, the Centre conducted RT-PCR and RRT-PCR tests and confirmed that the subtype was H5. On 12 Jan 2018, the sequencing of the H5 gene was carried out by the National Institute of Animal Health (NIAH), and the causative virus was determined as highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. On the same day, NIAH conducted the RT-PCR test and confirmed that the subtype of the virus was H5N6. Stamping-out policy was applied to the affected farm. Destruction of all the susceptible 51 000 birds in the affected farm and 40 000 birds in an epidemiologically linked farm is being implemented. Movement and shipment restrictions are imposed on the farms within a radius of 3 km and 3-10 km of the affected farm, respectively. Full genome sequencing of the virus is underway.

Control measures
Measures applied: movement control inside the country, screening, quarantine, stamping out, disinfection, vaccination prohibited, no treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied: No other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Tobu Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (Local laboratory) / Birds / real-time reverse transcriptase/polymerase chain reaction (RRT-PCR) / 11 Jan 2018 / Positive
Tobu Livestock Hygiene Service Centre (Local laboratory) / Birds / reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 11 Jan 2018 / Positive
National Institute of Animal Health (National laboratory) / gene sequencing / 12 Jan 2018 / Positive

[In Japan, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) subtype H5N6 had previously been detected last winter 2016/17.

From November 2016 to March 2017, Japan reported an event involving 170 outbreaks associated with captive birds and wild birds. That event was resolved on 8 Mar 2017. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21608. During the same period, 12 outbreaks were reported in poultry. That event was resolved on 27 Mar 2017. See event summary and report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=21714.

Starting November 2017 to date, 7 outbreaks of HPAI H5N6 have been detected in wild birds. This event still continuing. The most recent follow-up report No. 2, sent on 24 Nov 2017, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=25269.

The following abstract is quoted from the article titled "Five distinct reassortants of H5N6 highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza A viruses aﬀected Japan during the winter of 2016-2017" by Nobuhiro Takemae, Ryota Tsunekuni, Kirill Sharshov, Taichiro Tanikawa, Yuko Uchida, Hiroshi Ito, Kosuke Soda, Tatsufumi Usui, Ivan Sobolev, Alexander Shestopalov, Tsuyoshi Yamaguchi, Junki Mine, Toshihiro Ito, Takehiko Saito, published in December 2017 in Virology - Elsevier. The full article is available at https://tinyurl.com/yaft44er.

Abstract:

"To elucidate the evolutionary pathway, we sequenced the entire genomes of 89 H5N6 highly pathogenic avian inﬂuenza viruses (HPAIVs) isolated in Japan during winter 2016-2017 and 117 AIV/HPAIVs isolated in Japan and Russia. Phylogenetic analysis showed that at least 5 distinct genotypes of H5N6 HPAIVs aﬀected poultry and wild birds during that period. Japanese H5N6 isolates shared a common genetic ancestor in 6 of 8 genomic segments, and the PA and NS genes demonstrated 4 and 2 genetic origins, respectively. Six gene segments originated from a putative ancestral clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 virus that was a possible genetic reassortant among Chinese clade 2.3.4.4 H5N6 HPAIVs. In addition, 2 NS clusters and a PA cluster in Japanese H5N6 HPAIVs originated from Chinese HPAIVs, whereas 3 distinct AIV-derived PA clusters were evident. These results suggest that migratory birds were important in the spread and genetic diversiﬁcation of clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs." - Mod.CRD
