Another dead from listeriosis. A 75-year-old man died this afternoon in the Cardarelli intensive care unit in the Molise capital, after contracting listeriosis. His condition was immediately defined as very serious due to some previous pathologies. The man had been in intensive care for days after ingesting food, probably from ricotta. A check by the Hygiene Office was launched on the case to trace the type of food at the origin of the infection.

[By saying "another dead from listeriosis," the news report above implies that there are more recent cases of listeriosis in Molise. More information on this possible outbreak in Italy would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.

A discussion of listeriosis can be found in my moderator comments in ProMED post Listeriosis - Europe (02): Denmark, fatal, WGS, RFI 20220610.8703790.
