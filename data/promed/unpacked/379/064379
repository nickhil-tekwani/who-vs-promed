China Halts Exports of Maling Canned Meat
-----------------------------------------------
Exports from one of China's best-known food makers were stopped
Friday [7 Dec 2007] after Hong Kong authorities said they found
unsafe chemicals in canned luncheon meat. Shanghai-based Maling Food
Co. issued a statement Friday saying it had sent top executives to
Hong Kong to assist with an investigation into allegations that a
shipment of its meat, about as famous in China as Spam is in the
U.S., was contaminated with the antibiotic nitrofurans, which is
thought to cause cancer.

"We take this issue very seriously and immediately took relevant
measures, asking the Hong Kong authorities to recall the affected
products," Maling said in a statement on its Web site.

Phone calls to the company's offices rang unanswered Friday [7 Dec
2007] morning. The investigation comes amid a slew of findings of
potentially unsafe foods and other products. Chinese officials have
vowed to tighten controls on food processors, slaughterhouses and
other suppliers to help improve safety.

China closed more than 6000 slaughterhouses and created a database of
23 052 slaughterhouses across the country as part of its campaign to
improve food safety, the state-run newspaper China Daily reported
Friday [7 Dec 2007].

Various scandals both at home and abroad over products tainted with
chemicals and other toxins have prompted renewed vigilance over
widespread violations of safety standards, such as adding water to
dead pigs to raise their weight.

Late last month [November 2007], authorities in Shanghai arrested 2
people for allegedly processing chickens using industrial salt
[likely this was nitrate or nitrite as it is sometimes mistaken for
salt - Mod.TG]. The chickens were sold at outdoor markets and food
stalls in the suburbs, local reports said.

Maling is one of China's best-known food companies, with shares in
its Shanghai Maling Aquarius Co. traded on the Shanghai Stock
Exchange. The company issued a statement earlier in the week saying
it did not plan to recall lunch meat sold in the Chinese mainland
because it was produced separately. But a report in the state-run
newspaper Southern Daily, based in the southern city of Guangzhou,
said the product had been pulled from local supermarket shelves.

That report quoted a Maling safety official saying the pork might
have been contaminated before it reached the factory.

Officials at the Shanghai Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau
would not comment but referred callers to a brief notice about the
investigation posted on their Web site.

The export suspension applies to all of Maling's canned food
products, which include meat, seafood, fruits and vegetables.

[Nitrofurans have been regarded as both carcinogenic and mutagenic in
human beings. Nitrofurans have been used to effectively to prevent
and/or treat of gastrointestinal infections caused by _Escherichia
coli, Salmonella spp., Mycoplasma spp., Coccidia_ spp., coliforms and
some other protozoa and as growth promoters in livestock.

Although the various pharmaceutical agents rapidly leave the animal's
body, the metabolites appear to be tightly bound to muscle tissue and
are therefore available for consumption. There has been an associated
link to mutagenesis and carcinogenesis, resulting in the EU, the USA
and Canada (and probably others) banning the use of these
pharmaceutical agents in food producing animals.

This article implies the nitrofurans may have been in the meat prior
to processing, which means the animal(s) were treated with a
nitrofuran containing pharmaceutical compounds. Nitrofurans have been
used in meat and seafood to prevent bacterial growth, but this is
also prohibited by many countries. - Mod.TG]
