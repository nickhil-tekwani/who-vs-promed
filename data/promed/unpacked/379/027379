The 1st case of Crimean-Congo [hemorrhagic fever has been] discovered in Saint-Louis.

The news came yesterday [10 Nov 2015] as a blow to the people of Ndiawdoune, [Senegal], a village 15 km [9 miles] northeast of Saint-Louis. The girl was suspected to be affected by the Ebola virus disease, [but] was found negative for Ebola. But the results of the analysis show that it is Crimean-Congo [hemorraghic fever].

The results of the tests performed by the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Fann Hospital in Dakar revealed that the patient was infected by the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [virus], which presents the same symptoms as Ebola: high fever, stool spotted with blood, and vomiting among other symptoms.

The virus of this fever is transmitted to humans from ticks and livestock. Person [to person] transmission can occur as a result of direct contact with blood, secretions, organs or bodily fluids of infected persons, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

According to the information on the site of this international organization, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a common disease caused by a virus (Nairovirus) of the family Bunyaviridae, transmitted by ticks. It causes severe outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fever with a mortality rate of 10-40 percent. Also, the sources report, there is no vaccine either for humans or animals.

The information arouses surprise and fear among the victim's relatives in Ndiawdoune who already are calling for the support of relevant authorities to save their child.

This disease was 1st discovered in Europe, in particular in the Crimea, and then in the Congo.

[Although seldom reported in Senegal, there was a previous case of CCHF that was contracted in Senegal but who came down with the illness in France (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20041125.3152).

The circumstances under which the patient above acquired her CCHF virus infection are not stated. It could have been via tick bite or via exposure to the blood of an infected animal. From the above report, it seems unlikely that she was infected from close contact with an infected individual, as most of these cases of transmission occur in health care facilities.

The virus can cause severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. The virus is transmitted by _Hyalomma_ spp ticks or through contact with infected human blood or animal blood and tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and veterinarians. Exposure in health care facilities can also occur, which is why there is concern for the health care workers who are in contact with patients.

The length of the incubation period depends on the mode of acquisition of the virus. Following infection by a tick bite, the incubation period is usually 1-3 days, with a maximum of 9 days.

CCHF virus is a tickborne virus in the genus _Nairovirus_, family _Bunyaviridae_.
