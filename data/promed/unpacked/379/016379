Northeastern Syria, which is controlled by the "Syrian Democratic Forces" (SDF), is witnessing a sharp rise in the number of leishmaniasis cases, and the infections were concentrated in the eastern countryside of Deir Ez-Zor and the countryside of Hasaka near the Khabur river.

According to the official responsible for treating leishmaniasis sufferers in the "Kurdish Red Crescent" [NGO] medical point, Hinoud Ibrahim, the number of recorded cases of the disease in the Khabur area has reached more than 16 500 cases since August [2021] and until the end of last year [2021].

She added, "Lakerin Hospital" receives daily about 100 patients with leishmaniasis, which are minute parasites that are transmitted to the body usually through the bite of an infected female sandfly, according to the "Al-Araby Al-Jadeed" website.

She pointed out that the currently available treatment for leishmaniasis patients is an injection of glucantime, after conducting a clinical or laboratory examination, to determine the type of injection that the patient will take, either intramuscularly or under the skin.

Leishmaniasis is the penetration of single-celled parasites of the genus _Leishmania_ into the skin, after being bitten or stung by a female sandfly, a very small insect whose size does not exceed 1/3 of the size of an ordinary mosquito.

The insect transmits leishmaniasis through the blood of the infected person and then transfers it to the blood of the next person, and it spreads widely in agricultural and rural areas.

The Kurdish Red Crescent is carrying out campaigns to spray insecticides for this fly in the camp after the municipality worked to remove the random dumps scattered next to the camp, which were contributing to the spread of this fly.

According to the information of the Asian News Agency, the health sector in Deir Ez-Zor Governorate, especially in the areas under the control of the SDF, suffers from a shortage of cadres, equipment, and vaccines necessary to deal with such a disease.

The source clarifies that the health centers were supported only by a small number and not enough ampoules for treatment, and intermittently.

According to the source, many families are forced to buy ampoules for the treatment of leishmaniasis from pharmacies at their own expense, as the price of one ampoule is about 3000 Syrian pounds [about USD 1.20], and contains 5 ml of the drug.

According to the World Health Organization, leishmaniasis affects the poorest people in the world and is linked to malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, a weak immune system, and lack of financial resources. Prevention and control of leishmaniasis require a combination of strategies and interventions because transmission of the disease occurs in a complex biological system that includes human and animal reservoirs, the parasitic organism, and vector sandflies.

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis, CL, caused by _Leishmania tropica_ is endemic in Aleppo, Idlib, Lattakia, Tartous, Hama, and the city of Damascus. It represents about 90% of all CL cases. (Alvar J, VÃ©lez ID, Bern C, et al; WHO Leishmaniasis Control Team. Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS One. 2012; 7(5): e35671; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035671 with a supplement on Syria; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035671.s086).

Control rests on controlling the rodent reservoir and vector. Indoor residual spraying has not proven effective and the planned distribution of insecticide-impregnated bed nets has not happened. - Mod.EP
