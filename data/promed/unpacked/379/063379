The Tennessee Department of Health said they're seeing more cases of a potentially deadly tickborne illness, with signs of it locally. "We have seen a slightly increased incidences of tick-born illnesses in Rocky Mountain spotted fever, however there are natural variations from year-to-year," said Tamara Chavez-Lindell with the East Tennessee Regional Health Office. As of Thursday [31 Jul 2014], the department reported 328 cases of the illness; 6 of those cases are in Knox County.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a disease caused by bacteria transferred from tick bites to humans, causing a spotted rash. This disease does not appear immediately following a tick bite, and if not treated, is potentially deadly. "The initial symptoms are usually fever and a few days after the fever, we'll often see a rash. A very flat, non-itchy rash," Chavez -Lindell added.

The illness is carried in either the brown dog or American dog tick -- which are the most common kinds of ticks in Tennessee. Officials said that's all the more reason to watch out, with some simple advice to keep in mind. "The best way to remove them is with a pair of tweezers: grasp the tick on its head as close to your skin as possible and pull it out -- straight out," Chavez-Lindell said.

The best way to prevent [detect] ticks is to wear light, long sleeved clothing. Also wear socks over pant legs to prevent ticks from climbing up. Officials said legs are the most common spot for ticks.

[The incidence of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF), which has been a reportable disease in the United States since the 1920s, has increased during the last decade, from less than 2 cases per million persons in 2000 to over 6 cases per million in 2010. During the same time period, the proportion of RMSF cases resulting in death (case fatality) has declined from a high of almost 30 percent in the 1944 to a low of less than 0.5 percent in 2010 (http://www.cdc.gov/rmsf/stats/). As of 1 Jan 2010, cases of RMSF are reported under a new category called spotted fever rickettsiosis (including Rocky Mountain spotted fever).

Cases of spotted fever (RMSF) in Tennessee have fluctuated since 2008 from a low of 187 cases in 2009 to a high of 696 in 2012, with 378 cases reported in the 1st 7 months of 2012 and 244 cases having been reported in the same period in 2013 (http://health.state.tn.us/ceds/WeeklyReports/WeeklyReports.asp). The news report above says that 328 cases of RMSF have been reported in Tennessee in this same period of time this year (2014).

North Carolina, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Missouri account for over 60 percent of RMSF cases. RMSF is caused by _Rickettsia rickettsii_, which is primarily transmitted in these states by the American dog tick (_Dermacentor variabilis_; http://www.tickencounter.org/tick_identification/dog_tick#top). The Rocky Mountain wood tick (_Dermacentor andersoni_; http://www.tickencounter.org/tick_identification/rocky_mountain_wood_tick#top) is the vector in the Rocky Mountain states, and the Brown dog tick (_Rhipicephalus sanguineus_; http://www.tickencounter.org/tick_identification/brown_dog_tick#top>) in the southwestern US and along the US-Mexico border (http://www.cdc.gov/ticks/geographic_distribution.html).

The incubation period is 5-10 days, long after tick has detached and the onset of the illness for most cases occurs during the summer months and peaks in June and July.
