Australia's banana industry was in crisis 19 months ago after the
devastation of Cyclone Larry in far north Queensland. Northern
Territory (NT) farmers were the big winners as banana prices went
through the roof and demand outstripped supply. Now the Northern
Territory industry, which had such bright prospects, is itself facing
collapse from the exotic Panama disease.

The Borsato Company runs the biggest banana plantation in the Top
End. It supplies 2 thirds of the NT market and as the recent harvest
of firm ripe fruit is packed into boxes, you would never think the
industry here was on its knees. But look closer at the trees
themselves and manager Mark Smith sees all the tell-tale signs of the
devastating Panama disease -- stunted growth, wilting yellow leaves,
and discoloured stalks. "Basically, it just invades the banana plant
and the plant blocks off the vascular tubes that feed the nutrients
around the tree and basically the banana plant kills itself," he said.

First detected in Australia 10 years ago, this soil fungus has
already destroyed other plantations and is now crippling this one. It
has left Borsato with no choice but to shut down its entire NT
operation. "It's now down to virtually finishing up. We had 300 acres
(121.4 hectares) of bananas here with prospects of expanding -- we're
down to 40 acres (16.2 hectares) now, which says it all," he said.
"We haven't planted any more so we'll probably get another 12 months
out of this 40 acres and then shut up shop as far as bananas go."

The only hope now of saving the NT industry is to find or develop a
Panama-resistant variety of bananas. Mr Smith blames the Territory
Government for not doing better research to achieve that and control
the disease from spreading between farms. "It just seemed strange
that all the growers got it within 12 months of them finding it here
in the Territory, and there have been people growing bananas for a
long time up here that didn't have any problems with Panama," he said.

But Northern Territory Primary Industries Minister Chris Natt denies
the industry is about to fold. "We are undertaking quite a bit of
research at the moment to find out whether there are varieties of
bananas that are immune to the disease," he said. "We understand that
there is probably 3 or 4, and to see if we can increase the industry
within the Northern Territory. We would like to think that we can get
on top of it and find some other varieties that can be used in the
market in the future."

[Panama disease (PD; also called Fusarium wilt) is caused by the
soil-borne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_, which is one
of more than 100 special forms of _F. oxysporum_ that cause vascular
wilts of flowering plants. These fungi enter the roots from the soil
and spread throughout the plant killing it by blocking the vascular
tissue. Symptoms of PD are yellowing, wilting, and dark purple or red
streaking in the pseudostem. Affected plants die rapidly. The disease
is spread by infected planting material and soil and can move in
water flowing over infected areas. It is very easily moved in
infected soil. The disease lasts in the soil for over 30 years making
infected plantations useless for future banana cultivation. There is
no known chemical or cultural cure. Disease management includes
exclusion and eradication. Resistant or tolerant cultivars for
commercial use are being developed but are not yet available.

There are 4 races of the Panama disease pathogen, but this report
does not state which one is doing the damage. Races 2 (contained in
Queensland) and 3 (affecting _Heliconia_ species only) are not likely
to be involved. Race 1 and the temperate race 4 are present in other
parts of Australia. Only the tropical race 4 has been reported from
NT before, and attempts of quarantine containment have been made
earlier. Possibly these attempts have failed.

PD has been a major problem for banana cultivation worldwide for over
a century. It forced the change over from previous highly susceptible
banana cultivars to the resistant Cavendish variety. However, the
pathogen apparently adjusted and became able to affect Cavendish as
well causing large-scale destruction once again. It is thought that a
new variant of tropical race 4 may be responsible for outbreaks in
Cavendish. The history of PD demonstrates the inherent dangers of monoculture
