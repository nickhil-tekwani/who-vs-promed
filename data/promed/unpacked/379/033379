A mare in Marion, Florida, has tested positive for the neurological strain of equine herpesvirus, type 1 (EHV-1), raising concerns a very aggressive strain of the virus currently circulating in Europe may eventually make its way to the United States. [Currently there is no evidence of this more aggressive form in the USA. - Mod.TG]

EHV-1 most often causes mild-to-moderate respiratory illness (rhinopneumonitis), but the infection occasionally leads to the life-threatening neurologic disease equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM), [which] occurs when EHV-1 attacks the cells lining the central nervous system, damaging blood vessels serving the brain and spinal cord. The mechanisms through which EHV-1 produces neurologic disease are not yet understood. [EHM has always been a devastating disease to horses, and this form of the disease has no preventative vaccine. - Mod.TG]

There is no vaccine that specifically protects against EHM, so biosecurity is a crucial part of prevention. EHV-1 spreads from horse to horse through nasal discharge or aerosol droplets. Humans can spread the virus via contaminated hands, clothing, and equipment.

The 8-year-old mare in Florida developed ataxia and weakness in her hind limbs on 1 Mar [2021], and the diagnosis of neurologic EHV-1 was confirmed on 3 Mar [2021], according to the Equine Disease Control Communication Center (EDCC). Although it has not been confirmed that the mare has the more aggressive strain, veterinary officials are encouraging everyone in the equestrian community to be vigilant, cautious, and careful. The following statement appeared on the EDCC website:

"As of 3 Mar [2021], the affected horse continues to be treated in a separate isolation facility. No additional EHV-1 cases have been detected. The Division of Animal Industry placed the premises under quarantine and immediately began a disease investigation. Additional movement requirements or restrictions have not been imposed by Florida or any other states at this time. We are advising horse owners and trainers to contact the venue of destination for any additional requirements prior to travel.

"However, in light of the recent EHV-1 outbreak in Europe, we are encouraging all facilities to isolate horses importing into Florida from the affected regions in Europe and enact strict biosecurity measures to include monitoring the horse's health and taking temperatures twice per day for at least 14 days. We are asking all those in the equine community to practice prudent biosecurity on their farms and to report any suspected cases of EHV-1.

"For reporting, call (850) 410-0900 Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. and 1-800-342-5869 after hours and weekends, or email RAD@FDACS.gov. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services will continue to work with the affected premises management, owners, and veterinarians to ensure proper safeguards are taken to prevent further spread of the disease."

The emergence of a very aggressive strain of neurologic EHV-1 from Spain led the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI), the international governing body of Olympic equestrian disciplines, to cancel nearly all competitions in mainland Europe earlier this week until at least 28 Mar [2021].

FEI Secretary General Sabrina Ibanez said in a statement at the time "...this EHV-1 outbreak is probably the most serious we have had in Europe for many decades, and our decision is based on clearly identified epidemiological risk factors.

"This strain of EHV-1 is particularly aggressive and has already caused equine fatalities and a very large number of severe clinical cases. We need to keep our horses safe. We are also aware that a large number of horses left the venue in Valencia without an official health certificate, meaning they had an unknown health status. Some horses were already sick, and the risk of transmission from these horses is a major concern."

There are 53 potentially exposed horses at the Florida stable.

The FEI [Federation Equestre Internationale] announced 1 Mar [2021] that competition has been cancelled until 28 Mar [2021] in 10 European countries including France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium, Italy, Austria, Poland, the Netherlands, Germany, and Slovakia due to the outbreak of the equine herpesvirus.

As of 3 Mar [2021], there has only been one case of EHV 1 reported in Ocala, Florida, by the Equine Disease Communication Center; all facilities and show management are on high alert.

As the virus has now been identified in Ocala, and out of an abundance of caution, World Equestrian Center - Ocala management has issued increased biosecurity measures and the following to keep showing horses safe:

[It is unclear from the above if this particular strain of EHV-1, also known as EHM, is the same strain as what Europe has, or if it is the neurological form the US has continued to battle and ProMED-mail has reported on. Based on other articles, including the following one, I suspect this paragraph is referring to the EHV-1/EHM that the USA already has. - Mod.TG]

Effective immediately,

- World Equestrian Center - Ocala will no longer permit [shipping] in horses to the property;
- no new entries travelling from other events in Florida will be accepted, including the Winter Equestrian Festival (WEF), HITS, Venice, or the Ridge;
- all World Equestrian Center - Ocala stabling areas will be strictly limited to essential personnel: riders, trainers, grooms, vets, and farriers;
- no non-essential people will be admitted to the stabling areas.

If you have questions, please contact horse show manager TJ Campbell (<tj.campbell@wec.net>), director of operations Vinnie Card (<vinnie.card@wec.net>), or onsite veterinarian Dr. Larry Wexler DVM (<lwexlerdvm@gmail.com>).

On Wednesday (3 Mar [2021]), the University of Pennsylvania's large animal hospital, New Bolton Center in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, diagnosed a patient admitted with neurologic signs as having equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHV-1). The affected horse was euthanized.

The limited number of potentially exposed horses have been identified and are being contacted by New Bolton Center and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture. Due to the limited nature of the potential exposure, New Bolton Center's clinical hospital operations have not been affected. This case has no known association with international travel, transport, or exhibition. New Bolton Center is working closely with the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture and will provide additional updates as they become available.

["Equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) and equine herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) comprise 2 antigenically distinct groups of viruses previously referred to as subtypes 1 and 2 of EHV-1. Both viruses are ubiquitous in horse populations worldwide and produce an acute febrile respiratory disease upon primary infection, characterized by rhinopharyngitis and tracheobronchitis. Outbreaks of respiratory disease occur annually among foals in areas with concentrated horse populations. Most of these outbreaks in weanlings are caused by strains of EHV-4. The age, seasonal, and geographic distributions vary and are determined by immune status and horse population. In individual horses, the outcome of exposure is determined by viral strain, immune status, pregnancy status, and possibly age. Infection of pregnant mares with EHV-4 rarely results in abortion.

"Mares may abort several weeks to months after clinical or subclinical infection with EHV-1. The neurologic form of EHV-1 has demonstrated increasing morbidity and mortality in the documented outbreaks since 2000 and appears to be evolving in virulence and behavior. Therefore, the USDA has designated neuropathic EHV-1 as a potentially emerging disease. The natural reservoir of both EHV-1 and EHV-4 is the horse. Latent infections and carrier states are seen with both virus types. Transmission occurs by direct or indirect contact with infectious nasal secretions, aborted fetuses, placentas, or placental fluids.

"The incubation period of EHV is 2-10 days. Susceptible horses develop fever of 102-107 deg F (38.9-41.7 deg C), neutropenia and lymphopenia, serous nasal discharge, malaise, pharyngitis, cough, inappetence, and/or submandibular or retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy. Horses infected with EHV-1 strains often develop a biphasic fever, with cell-associated viremia coinciding with the 2nd temperature peak. Secondary bacterial infections are common and manifest with mucopurulent nasal exudate and pulmonary disease. The infection is mild or inapparent in horses immunologically sensitized to the virus.

"Mares that abort after EHV-1 infection seldom display premonitory signs. Abortions occur 2-12 wk after infection, usually between months 7 and 11 of gestation. Aborted fetuses are fresh or minimally autolyzed, and the placenta is expelled shortly after abortion. There is no evidence of damage to the mare's reproductive tract, and subsequent conception is unimpaired. Mares exposed late in gestation may not abort but give birth to live foals with fulminating viral pneumonitis. Such foals are susceptible to secondary bacterial infections and usually die within hours or days.

"Lesions:
The pathogenetic mechanisms of EHV-1 and EHV-4 differ significantly. EHV-4 infection is restricted to respiratory tract epithelium and associated lymph nodes; EHV-1 strains develop cell-associated viremia and have a predilection for vascular endothelium, especially the nasal mucosa, lungs, placenta, adrenal, thyroid, and CNS. The neuropathic strain of EHV-1 produces a viremic load 10- to 100-fold higher than that of non-neuropathic strains.

"Gross lesions of viral rhinopneumonitis are hyperemia and ulceration of the respiratory epithelium, and multiple, tiny, plum-colored foci in the lungs. Histologically, there is evidence of inflammation, necrosis, and intranuclear inclusions in the respiratory epithelium and germinal centers of the associated lymph nodes. Lung lesions are characterized by neutrophilic infiltration of the terminal bronchioles, peribronchiolar and perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration, and serofibrinous exudate in the alveoli.

"Typical lesions in EHV-1 abortion include interlobular lung edema and pleural fluid; multifocal areas of hepatic necrosis; petechiation of the myocardium, adrenal gland, and spleen; and thymic necrosis. Intranuclear inclusions are found in lung, liver, adrenal, and lymphoreticular tissues.

"Diagnosis:
Equine viral rhinopneumonitis is difficult to clinically differentiate from equine influenza (see equine influenza, https://www.merckvetmanual.com/respiratory-system/respiratory-diseases-of-horses/equine-influenza), equine viral arteritis (see equine viral arteritis, https://www.merckvetmanual.com/generalized-conditions/equine-viral-arteritis/overview-of-equine-viral-arteritis), or other equine respiratory infections solely on the basis of clinical signs. Definitive diagnosis is determined by PCR or virus isolation from samples obtained via nasopharyngeal swab and citrated blood sample (buffy coat) early in the course of the infection.

"In cases of suspected EHV-1 abortion, definitive diagnosis is based on PCR, virus isolation, and characteristic gross and microscopic lesions in the aborted fetus. Lung, liver, adrenal, and lymphoreticular tissues are productive sources of virus. Serologic testing of mares after abortion has little diagnostic value. Diagnosis of neuropathic EHV-1 is determined by real-time PCR on samples obtained from nasal secretions, CSF, or neural tissue to detect the neuropathic strain of EHV-1. A presumptive diagnosis can be based on clinical signs and CSF analysis (xanthochromia, albuminocytologic dissociation). Necropsy reveals characteristic perivascular cuffing and hemorrhage in the CNS.

"Treatment:
There is no specific treatment for EHV infection. Rest and nursing care are indicated to minimize secondary bacterial complications. Antipyretics are recommended for horses with a fever greater than 104 deg F (40 deg C). Antibiotic therapy is instituted upon suspicion of secondary bacterial infection evidenced by purulent nasal discharge or pulmonary disease. Most foals infected prenatally with EHV-1 die shortly after birth despite intensive nursing and antimicrobial medication. If horses with neuropathic EHV-1 remain ambulatory or are recumbent for only 2-3 days, the prognosis is usually favorable. Valacyclovir (30 mg/kg, PO, bid) has shown promise in the treatment of affected horses and in prophylaxis during EHV-1 outbreaks. Intensive nursing care is necessary to avoid pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, ruptured bladder, or bowel atony. Recovery may be complete, but a small percentage of cases have neurologic sequelae.

"Control:
Immunity after natural infection with either EHV-1 or EHV-4 involves a combination of humoral and cellular immunity. Whereas little cross-protection occurs between virus types after primary infection of immunologically naive foals, significant cross-protection develops in horses after repeated infections with a particular virus type. Most adult horses are latently infected with EHV-1 and EHV-4. The infection remains dormant for most of the horse's life, although stress or immunosuppression may result in recrudescence of disease and shedding of infectious virus. Immunity to reinfection of the respiratory tract may persist for as long as 3 mo, but multiple infections result in a level of immunity that prevents clinical signs of respiratory disease. Diminished resistance in pregnant mares allows cell-associated viremia, which may result in transplacental infection of the fetus.

"For prevention and control of EHV-4- and EHV-1-related diseases, management practices that reduce viral spread are recommended. New horses (or those returning from other premises) should be isolated for 21 days before commingling with resident horses, especially pregnant mares. Management-related, stress-inducing circumstances should be avoided to prevent recrudescence of latent virus. Pregnant mares should be maintained in a group away from the weanlings, yearlings, and horses out of training. In an outbreak of respiratory disease or abortion, affected horses should be isolated and appropriate measures taken for disinfection of contaminated premises. No horse should leave the premises for 3 wk after recovery of the last clinical case.

"Vaccination (EHV-4 and EHV-1) should begin when foals are 4-6 mo old. A 2nd dose is given 4-6 wk later, and a 3rd dose at 10-12 mo of age. Booster vaccinations may be indicated as often as every 6 mo through maturity (5 yr of age). Vaccination programs against herpesviruses should include all horses that travel to high-risk destinations (racetrack, show grounds) and all other horses on the premises. A high-antigen load, inactivated EHV-1 vaccine is recommended to prevent EHV-1 abortion. Vaccine should be administered during months 3, 5, 7, and 9 of pregnancy. Mares are often vaccinated with inactivated EHV-1/EHV-4 at an interval 4-6 wk before foaling. A modified-live EHV-1 vaccine is available to help prevent respiratory disease caused by EHV-1."
