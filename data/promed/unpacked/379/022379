The solitary lifestyle and reclusive habits of the ferret-badger suggest to me that we may be looking at maternal transmission of an exceptionally slowly emerging rabies strain, which would not become evident until a significant number of ferret-badgers were infected and behaving abnormally. Otherwise, my understanding is that ferret-badgers have very little to do with each other, or with other animals, and so transmission from ferret-badger to ferret-badger after they reach maturity and disperse would be unlikely.

Bats are fairly commonly blown back and forth from mainland China, so what I'm thinking is that there may be a bat rabies strain that has mutated to infect ferret-badgers, and was separately passed to ferret-badgers on either side of the Straits of Formosa. But it would have to be a strain with a very long latency interval.

Even maternal transmission poses certain problems, in that the ferret-badger litter size is only 2-3. But so far as I know, littermates are the only other ferret-badgers that any ferret-badger is likely to encounter except at mating time.

Ferret-badgers are most often born in May and June, and this outbreak appears to have emerged just about the time that the young ferret-badgers would be setting off to find their own habitat.

[Until the Taiwanese authorities release more detailed information on their surveillance activities, it will remain uncertain whether this outbreak of rabies virus infection in the Formosan ferret-badger population of Taiwan is the outcome of a recent introduction, or has remained undetected for a long period as a consequence of the ecological isolation of these animals. The outcome of genomic studies, which may help to establish the origin of the outbreak strain, is awaited. - Mod.CP
