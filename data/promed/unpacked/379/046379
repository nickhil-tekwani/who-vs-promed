Infection with _Perkinsus olseni_, Australia
--------------------------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 01 May 2015 from Dr Mark Schipp, Chief Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture, Canberra, Australia

Date of start of the event: 9 Apr 2015
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 30 Apr 2015
Date event resolved: 30 Apr 2015
Reason for notification: listed disease in a new host species
Causal agent: _Perkinsus olseni_
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Westernport Bay, Victoria
Date of start of the outbreak: 9 Apr 2015
Outbreak status: resolved (30 Apr 2015)
Epidemiological unit: coastal area
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-closed
Affected animals:
Species / Morbidity* / Mortality* / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Flat oyster (_Ostrea angasi_) / 0* / 0* / 22/ 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
*scale 0 to 5
Affected population: Broodstock originating from the wild held in a hatchery.

Outbreak statistics [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / Morbidity rate / Mortality rate / Case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Flat oyster (_Ostrea angasi_) / 4.55 / 0 / 0 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: specimens of _Ostrea angasi_ were examined by histology as part of annual surveillance. The oysters were in poor condition due to inadequate nutrition. Histopathology provided evidence of _Perkinsus_ infection. Subsequent testing by a qPCR screening test for _Perkinsus olseni_ produced 3 positive results from 22 samples. The OIE _Perkinsus olseni_ specific PCR produced one positive result from the 3 qPCR positive samples. This amplicon was sequenced and shared a greater than 99.3 percent similarity with _Perkinsus olseni_. This is considered an incidental finding. No further action will be taken.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Australian Animal Health Laboratory (National laboratory) / Flat oyster (_Ostrea angasi_) / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 30 Apr 2015 / Positive
AgriBio Centre (Regional Reference Laboratory) / Flat oyster (_Ostrea angasi_) / histopathological examination / 9 Apr 2015 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is resolved. No more reports will be submitted.

[Several species of the protist genus _Perkinsus_ are responsible for causing perkinsosis in molluscs such as oysters, mussels, clams, and abalone worldwide. _P. olseni_ is the only species known to cause this disease in the Asia-Pacific region and is responsible for perkinsosis in abalone, clams, and pearl oysters. _P. atlanticus_ is a junior synonym of _P. olseni_ (http://bit.ly/13BnhxY).

_P. olseni_ has been officially reported from New South Wales, South Australia, and Western Australia. Although _P. olseni_ was originally reported from abalone, recent studies suggest that, in Australia, a single species of _Perkinsus_ occurs in a wide variety of molluscs, including clams and pearl oysters. http://www.daff.gov.au/SiteCollectionDocuments/animal-plant/aquatic/field-guide/4th-edition/molluscs/infection-perkinsus-olseni.doc.

The Angasi oyster (_Ostrea angasi_) also commonly known as flat oysters occur naturally along the entire coast of New South Wales and extend into southern Queensland as well as into all the southern states and Western Australia (http://www.sydneycityoysters.com.au/index.php?route=product/category&path=45_55).

The causal agent of perkinsosis, _P. olseni_, does not pose a risk to human health. - Mod.CRD
