Plague reported in 8 Madagascar districts
-----------------------------------------
In an update on the plague situation in Madagascar, the Ministry of Health is now reporting plague has affected 8 districts in the country-Central Highlands, Ambalavao, Ambatofinandrahana, Ambositra, Ankazobe, Fandriana, Miarinarivo and Antisirabe. In these 8 districts, 16 suspect cases have been reported in a month, including 4 fatalities. A total of 5 of the cases have been laboratory confirmed. Of the 5 confirmed cases, 2 were classified as bubonic plague and 3 as pulmonary plague.

Plague is known to be endemic in Madagascar and a seasonal upsurge (predominantly the bubonic form) usually occurs early every year between September and April.

[From the last update, 2 days before this, there were 2 deaths and a total of 13 cases. When these new cases first developed is not clear.

2017 was indeed a "banner" season for plague in the island nation of Madagascar. The outbreak was notable not only for the large number of cases but also for the high percentage of cases of pneumonic plague in urban settings and in areas where the infection generally does not occur.

The following paragraph is from Chanteau S, Ratsifasoamanana L, Rasoamanana B, et al: Plague, a reemerging disease in Madagascar. Emerg Infect Dis. 1998; 4(1): 101-4, PMID: 9452403, available at
http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/4/1/98-0114_article.htm.

"Between 1930 and 1990, bubonic plague had "virtually disappeared" on the island due to efficient pest-control and good health management. However since 1990, an annual 200 cases are being reported and bubonic plague takes on epidemic form, especially in the port of Mahajanga, each year. In the capital city of Antananarivo, more cases are also being notified each year since 1990. Madagascar (pop. 13 million) has accounted for 45 percent of all the cases of plague in Africa."

Fatalities related to plague usually are caused by spread of the organism from the bubo (the very painful infected lymph node which drains the area where the flea bite occurred) to the bloodstream. The bacteremia can cause a coagulopathy, producing the purpura seen in the "black plague" and also spread to the lungs causing a hemorrhagic pneumonia. It is the pneumonia that can facilitate person-to-person transmission.

Madagascar was the location of the isolation of multi-antimicrobial resistant _Y. pestis_ in 1995 (Galimand M, Guiyoule A, Gerbaud G, et al: Multidrug resistance in _Yersinia pestis_ mediated by a transferable plasmid. N Engl J Med. 1997; 337(10): 677-80, PMID: 9278464; available at, http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199709043371004). The strain was resistant to chloramphenicol, streptomycin, and tetracycline but sensitive to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim as well as other aminoglycosides. This was an ominous observation; however, it is not clear whether this naturally occurring strain has persisted or spread. - Mod.LL
