--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As SARS-CoV-2 continues its global spread, it's possible that one of the pillars of COVID-19 pandemic control -- universal facial masking -- might help reduce the severity of disease and ensure that a greater proportion of new infections are asymptomatic. If this hypothesis is borne out, universal masking could become a form of "variolation" that would generate immunity and thereby slow the spread of the virus in the United States and elsewhere, as we await a vaccine.

One important reason for population-wide facial masking became apparent in March [2020], when reports started to circulate describing the high rates of SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding from the noses and mouths of patients who were presymptomatic or asymptomatic -- shedding rates equivalent to those among symptomatic patients./1 Universal facial masking seemed to be a possible way to prevent transmission from asymptomatic infected people. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) therefore recommended on [3 Apr 2020] that the public wear cloth face coverings in areas with high rates of community transmission -- a recommendation that has been unevenly followed across the United States.

Past evidence related to other respiratory viruses indicates that facial masking can also protect the wearer from becoming infected, by blocking viral particles from entering the nose and mouth./2 Epidemiologic investigations conducted around the world -- especially in Asian countries that became accustomed to population-wide masking during the 2003 SARS pandemic -- have suggested that there is a strong relationship between public masking and pandemic control. Recent data from Boston demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 infections decreased among healthcare workers after universal masking was implemented in municipal hospitals in late March [2020].

Recent virologic, epidemiologic, and ecologic data have led to the hypothesis that facial masking may also reduce the severity of disease among people who do become infected./3 This possibility is consistent with a long-standing theory of viral pathogenesis, which holds that the severity of disease is proportionate to the viral inoculum received. Since 1938, researchers have explored, primarily in animal models, the concept of the lethal dose of a virus -- or the dose at which 50% of exposed hosts die (LD50). With viral infections in which host immune responses play a predominant role in viral pathogenesis, such as SARS-CoV-2, high doses of viral inoculum can overwhelm and dysregulate innate immune defenses, increasing the severity of disease. Indeed, down-regulating immunopathology is one mechanism by which dexamethasone improves outcomes in severe COVID-19 infection. As proof of concept of viral inocula influencing disease manifestations, higher doses of administered virus led to more severe manifestations of COVID-19 in a Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV-2 infection./4

If the viral inoculum matters in determining the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection, an additional hypothesized reason for wearing facial masks would be to reduce the viral inoculum to which the wearer is exposed and the subsequent clinical impact of the disease. Since masks can filter out some virus-containing droplets (with filtering capacity determined by mask type),/2 masking might reduce the inoculum that an exposed person inhales. If this theory bears out, population-wide masking, with any type of mask that increases acceptability and adherence,/2 might contribute to increasing the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that are asymptomatic.

The most obvious way to spare society the devastating effects of COVID-19 is to promote measures to reduce both transmission and severity of illness. But SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible, cannot be contained by syndromic-based surveillance alone,/1 and is proving difficult to eradicate, even in regions that implemented strict initial control measures. Efforts to increase testing and containment in the United States have been ongoing and variably successful, owing in part to the recent increase in demand for testing.

The hopes for vaccines are pinned not just on infection prevention: most vaccine trials include a secondary outcome of decreasing the severity of illness, since increasing the proportion of cases in which disease is mild or asymptomatic would be a public health victory. Universal masking seems to reduce the rate of new infections; we hypothesize that by reducing the viral inoculum, it would also increase the proportion of infected people who remain asymptomatic./3

Variolation was a process whereby people who were susceptible to smallpox were inoculated with material taken from a vesicle of a person with smallpox, with the intent of causing a mild infection and subsequent immunity. Variolation was practiced only until the introduction of the variola vaccine, which ultimately eradicated smallpox. Despite concerns regarding safety, worldwide distribution, and eventual uptake, the world has high hopes for a highly effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, and as of early September [2020], 34 vaccine candidates were in clinical evaluation, with hundreds more in development.

While we await the results of vaccine trials, however, any public health measure that could increase the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may both make the infection less deadly and increase population-wide immunity without severe illnesses and deaths. Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 seems to be rare, despite more than 8 months of circulation worldwide and as suggested by a macaque model. The scientific community has been clarifying for some time the humoral and cell-mediated components of the adaptive immune response to SARS-CoV-2 and the inadequacy of antibody-based seroprevalence studies to estimate the level of more durable T-cell and memory B-cell immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Promising data have been emerging in recent weeks suggesting that strong cell-mediated immunity results from even mild or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection,/5 so any public health strategy that could reduce the severity of disease should increase population-wide immunity as well.

To test our hypothesis that population-wide masking is one of those strategies, we need further studies comparing the rate of asymptomatic infection in areas with and areas without universal masking. To test the variolation hypothesis, we will need more studies comparing the strength and durability of SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell immunity between people with asymptomatic infection and those with symptomatic infection, as well as a demonstration of the natural slowing of SARS-CoV-2 spread in areas with a high proportion of asymptomatic infections.

Ultimately, combating the pandemic will involve driving down both transmission rates and severity of disease. Increasing evidence suggests that population-wide facial masking might benefit both components of the response.

[The importance of wearing masks is discussed in this report from NEJM. Since immunopathogenesis is related to dose in animal models, when higher doses of virus were administered, more severe manifestations of disease were observed. While masks may not fully protect the wearer from infection, they nonetheless serve to reduce the number of virus particles to which the individual is exposed, reducing the severity of disease and leading to asymptomatic infection rather than a severe case. This concept is reflected in experimental studies where scientists determine the LD50 of a virus or other pathogen, that is, what concentration of the agent leads to 50% of the animals succumbing to disease. The question is whether a lower viral dose helps build immunity. The authors compare this to variolation used to protect susceptible individuals from smallpox by inoculating them with scabs from a vesicle of an infected individual, leading to a mild infection followed by immunity. While purposefully exposing oneself to an infected individual while wearing a mask is not recommended as a good vaccination approach, research needs to address whether a lower dose leads to a milder infection which does not stimulate the immune response to the level that causes symptoms. - Mod.LK]

[2] Impact on female scientists
Date: Fri 18 Sep 2020 08:00 AM EDT

https://www.forbes.com/sites/hbsworkingknowledge/2020/09/18/covids-surprising-toll-on-careers-of-women-scientists/#41af3a3631c4


COVID-19 is claiming an unexpected career toll among scientific researchers, and particularly on women, new research shows. If you are female, have young children, or work in a lab, you are more likely to feel the career-crunching effects dealt by the pandemic, according to a new study from Harvard Business School professors Kyle R. Myers, Karim R. Lakhani, and 8 colleagues from institutions including Yale and Northwestern, published in the journal Nature Human Behavior in July [2020; see reference below].

There's already a "well-documented, persistent gender gap in science," the researchers write in their paper, "Unequal effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on scientists." That gap is becoming increasingly apparent across professions worldwide, for all kinds of working women as the coronavirus continues to wreak havoc in the United States and around the world. Myers, Lakhani, and their co-researchers queried nearly half a million scientists across some 20 categories for their work in mid-April [2020], roughly one month into widespread shutdowns tied to the pandemic in the United States. They drew more than 5700 responses from faculty, principal investigators, post-doctoral researchers, and others, or about 1.6 percent of the original inquiry mailing. They concentrated on scientists in Europe and the United States. The pandemic is particularly disruptive for younger scientists who have seen experiments disrupted at key points in their careers, the researchers say.

Careers interrupted
-------------------
For scientists who typically work longer than the standard 40-hour work week, valuable research time is being interrupted at potentially key points in careers.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, in fields that require physical labs and timed experiments -- like biological and chemical fields -- research time slid 30 to 40 percent. Overall, 55 percent of the respondents reported a decline in total work hours, 27 percent indicated no change, and 18 percent said they were spending more time devoted to work.

Scientists working in different disciplines were affected unevenly, according to the research. "Scientists working in fields that tend to rely on physical laboratories and time-sensitive experiments -- bench sciences such as biochemistry, biological sciences, chemistry, and chemical engineering -- reported the largest declines in research time, in the range of 30-40 percent below pre-pandemic levels." Fields that are less equipment-intensive -- such as mathematics, statistics, computer science, and economics -- reported the lowest declines in research time. The difference between fields can be as large as 4-fold, according to the study. The survey "provides quantitative evidence that highlights disparities in how the pandemic has affected the scientific workforce," the researchers write.

Like having a lab shut down
---------------------------
One impact stood out across all of the sciences: Women scientists reported a 5 percent larger decline in time spent on research than their male counterparts. Add mothers to the mix, and the disadvantage becomes even wider: Scientists with at least one child under 5 worked 17 percent less on research when variations between professions equalized, the authors found. Those with more than one child reported losing an additional 3 percent of time spent on research. "It really is revealing, the extent of the infrastructure needed to support women with children," Lakhani says. Without sufficient child care, "it's the same as having your lab shut down." The disparity for women with young children could be because inadequate systems don't allow female scientists to do their jobs at the same intensity as their male counterparts, the researchers wrote. "Whether or not your university is or is not allowing you to come onto campus does not seem to make a difference on what the scientists are reporting," Myers says. "It's not really about a policy of whether you can go into campus per se. It's whether your postdocs are willing to come into the chemistry lab and work alongside you or do you have to stay home and care for your young child? Those things seem to be the bottleneck."

Just 5 percent of the total scientists responding to the emailed query reported working fewer than 42 hours weekly before the pandemic struck. Yet more than half --55 percent -- said the pandemic has meant fewer hours working on research. Another 27 percent reported no change and 18 percent said they were working more.

The hidden effects of childcare
-------------------------------
So "'shelter at home' is not the same as 'work from home,'" the researchers write. They note the impact of caring for children can be hard to observe and isn't often considered when institutions craft broad work policy meant to cover as many employees as possible. The issue may linger as institutions plan to reopen amid the pandemic. Without adequate childcare services, "Researchers with young children may continue to be affected regardless of the reopening plans of institutions," they write. Leadership could consider childcare infrastructure at each university or institution when crafting reopening plans, both as the pandemic drags on and well into the recovery period, Myers and Lakhani suggest.

Are there national differences to study?
----------------------------------------
Researchers are continuing their analysis, both by collecting more responses from the initial survey as the pandemic drags on. They are also asking follow-up questions and enlisting additional teams from more universities to broaden the analysis. One area of inquiry could be the differences between child care policies in Europe versus the United States, for instance.

Childcare has always disproportionately fallen on women, and the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown of schools and daycare centers exacerbated what was already a disproportionate representation of men in the sciences. Labs being shut down affected both genders, but once scientists were free to return to their research, male scientists were 4 times more likely to have a partner to do fulltime care than females were.

Michelle R Clayman Institute for Gender Research, Stanford University, 2008; https://stanford.app.box.com/s/y5bicy7o3cxwtmgy22iu).

Women also tend to take on care of the home and meals and the responsibility of caring for old or sick relatives, and some studies suggest that female academics do more teaching than men, on average, so the burden of transitioning to online courses also affected women's research productivity. Individuals who could rapidly redirect their research to COVID-19, a fast advancing field, were in a better position to take advantage of addressing important new questions. Thus, more senior researchers were more likely to initiate research on SARS-CoV-2 and scientists early in their careers, more likely to include more females as the gender gap narrows, would be more affected. - Mod.LK]

[3] USA: airline travel
Date: Sat 19 Sep 2020

https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/nearly-11000-people-have-been-exposed-to-the-coronavirus-on-flights-the-cdc-says/2020/09/19/d609adbc-ed27-11ea-99a1-71343d03bc29_story.html


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated 1600 cases of people who flew while at risk of spreading the coronavirus, identifying nearly 11 000 people who potentially were exposed to the virus on flights. But though the agency says some of those travelers subsequently fell ill, in the face of incomplete contact tracing information and a virus that incubates over several days, it has not been able to confirm a case of transmission on a plane. That does not mean it hasn't happened, and recent scientific studies have documented likely cases of transmission on flights abroad. "An absence of cases identified or reported is not evidence that there were no cases," said Caitlin Shockey, a spokeswoman for the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine.

"CDC is not able to definitively determine that potential cases were associated (or not) with exposure in the air cabin or through air travel given the numerous opportunities for potential exposure associated with the entire travel journey and widespread global distribution of the virus," Shockey wrote in an email ... pinpointing when someone was exposed is difficult. Local health authorities also might not be able to test people reported as exposed or share test results with the CDC, she said.

In guidance for the public, the CDC acknowledges that viruses do not spread easily on planes because of the way the air is filtered, but it also emphasizes that air travel means being in proximity to people for long periods and encountering frequently touched surfaces on planes and in airports [and to and from the airport - Mod.LM]. The CDC's guidance for all kinds of travel is still that staying home is the best way to protect yourself and other people from the virus.

Michael Carome, the director of health research at the consumer organization Public Citizen, said the CDC numbers demonstrate that flying poses at least some risk of being exposed to the virus.

A deficiency of data
--------------------
The total numbers of people flying while carrying the virus and those exposed are unknown. States have long worked with the federal government to track the spread of infectious diseases on planes. But of the nearly 100 state and major local health departments contacted by The Washington Post, most did not provide a number of coronavirus cases they have documented involving air travel, with some saying they were not tracking that data. In addition, not every case identified locally becomes a CDC investigation.

Six health departments were able to provide numbers, saying they had identified more than 500 cases between them, figures that in some cases covered only a few weeks. Despite the documented risk of exposure, some experts as well as state and local public health officials say that being on a plane presents less of an infection risk than drinking at a crowded bar or going to an indoor party. The air on a plane is pulled out of the cabin and filtered, then mixed with fresh air and pumped back in. And airlines have imposed mask requirements even without a federal mandate.

Asked about the CDC's numbers, Katherine Estep, a spokeswoman for the industry organization Airlines for America, emphasized that there are no documented cases of transmission involving US flights. "Flying remains a safe and healthy experience," Estep said. But though the CDC has not confirmed such transmissions domestically, new studies of flights in Asia and Europe have identified instances where scientists think the virus has spread on commercial flights -- including one where passengers were wearing N95 masks, according to a paper published in a CDC journal. N95 masks, when worn correctly, are thought to offer some of the best protection against the virus.

Public health authorities in Britain recently ordered almost 200 passengers and crew into 2 weeks of quarantine after it was discovered that 7 people traveling to Wales from the Greek island of Zante on [25 Aug 2020] were infectious on the flight. Passengers told the BBC that boarding the plane was a free-for-all and that passengers were lax about wearing masks on the flight.

An analysis by the International Air Transport Association published in August [2020] identified 4 cases of possible transmission on aircraft. Among them was a [2 Mar 2020] flight from Britain to Viet Nam on which one symptomatic passenger is likely to have transmitted the virus to 15 other people, according to a study published Friday [18 Sep 2020] in the CDC journal. Most of them were sitting close to the symptomatic passenger in business class, but people elsewhere on the plane also tested positive. The study's authors said their results challenge the airline industry's safety claims, although they noted that the case dates to when wearing masks was not yet widespread. "...they wrote, calling for mandatory mask usage, good handwashing hygiene, and systematic testing and quarantining of arriving passengers [see COVID-19 update (407): in-flight transmission, wildlife research, WHO, global 20200919.7795084].

Two other scientific studies also have identified likely cases of transmission. One of those studies, also published in the CDC journal, looked at an evacuation flight from Northern Italy, one of the 1st regions in Europe to be badly hit by the virus, to South Korea. The flight was closely monitored by Korean health authorities, and passengers were given N95 masks to wear. But a team of Korean scientists reported that testing once the flight landed revealed that the plane had carried 6 asymptomatic passengers. On the 8th day after the flight landed, a 28-year-old woman began to feel ill and ultimately tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The woman had been self-quarantining before the flight and was in quarantine after arriving in South Korea, leading the researchers to conclude that she contracted the virus on the plane, perhaps when she removed her mask while using the lavatory. The research team acknowledged the role of the plane's filters as a defense against the virus but said contaminated surfaces or the mingling of passengers during boarding could be opportunities for exposure. They recommended the use of masks, hand washing, and social distancing while getting on and off planes.

Another study examined a flight from Israel to Germany carrying tourists who were exposed to a hotel manager who had the virus. 7 of them were carrying the virus when they boarded the plane, and the study concluded that it was most likely transmitted to 2 more people on board. "Transmissions do occur, even though the air circulation in the cabin likely reduces the rate of transmission," said Sandra Ciesek, a virologist at the University Hospital Frankfurt in Germany and one of the study's authors. People on the flight were not wearing masks, a factor that Ciesek said could have made a difference. She pointed to another study, in which she was involved, concerning an evacuation flight from China to Germany with sick passengers. Those passengers wore masks, Ciesek said, and there were no cases of transmission.

Convincing travelers that they will be safe on board has been a top priority for the airline industry, which has been among the hardest hit during the pandemic, with passenger numbers plummeting more than 95 percent. Passengers have slowly been returning, but the industry remains on its heels, warning of tens of thousands of furloughs and layoffs this fall. Aviation companies are backing their own research to better understand the potential risks.

In August [2020], an arm of the Defense Department that organizes commercial flights for military members, their families, and contractors worked with Boeing and United Airlines to gather data on how the virus moves inside planes. The tests, conducted at Washington Dulles International Airport, involved the release of aerosol particles among mannequins simulating passengers. Santarpia is working on the study, which is expected to report results in October [2020].

Officials at state and county health departments said that, like the CDC, they're regularly documenting cases of people flying while capable of spreading the virus. When local officials find a case, they typically share the information with their state's health authorities, and then the CDC coordinates with airlines to determine the identities of people who potentially have been exposed. The CDC's rules for determining exposure have evolved along with its understanding of the virus but include people sitting within 6 feet [2 m] of a reported case or all passengers on flights without assigned seating. Contact information is then passed back down the chain, but sometimes it is incomplete or out of date.

Air travel played a major role in spreading the virus around the world and the United States, but some health officials still say they consider exposure on planes a relatively minor risk. The acting state epidemiologist in Louisiana, Theresa Sokol, said officials there have not identified any coronavirus clusters involving air travel. In contrast, 41 outbreaks in the state have been ascribed to bars, 41 to restaurants, and 25 to day-care centers.

[The verdict isn't fully out as yet. The risk in bars and indoor venues is recognized as high, and basically, the airplane is analogous to an indoor venue although with improved air exchange, and in some cases a bar, as individuals tend to drink alcoholic beverages during flights. In the USA, there are the challenges of the politicization of implementing NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions) so there are people who refuse to wear masks and knowing that some airlines will remove them from flights, they don't take their stands until the flights are airborne. Not all airlines are continuing with reduced plane filling so some flights are fully booked, with passengers sitting next to strangers... The travel industry is definitely suffering greatly during the pandemic. Perhaps this might be a likely venue to introduce monitored use of the rapid saliva tests to identify individuals who are likely infectious at the time of check-in for their flights as an additional safety measure... - Mod.MPP]

- The Americas region reported 43.7% of daily case numbers and 58.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 15.4 million cases. The USA and Brazil remain dominant, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, and Ecuador. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Chile, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Canada, and Paraguay.

- The European region reported 15.0% of daily case numbers and 7.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 5.1 million. Countries not reporting cases today (20 Sep 2020) include Spain, Israel, Sweden, and Switzerland. The dominant country is France followed by Russia, UK, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Netherlands, Italy, Turkey, Germany, and Romania. Other countries reporting more than 1000 new cases in the past 24 hours include Hungary and Poland.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 5.5% of daily case numbers and 6.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 2.2 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, Tunisia, UAE, Libya, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, Pakistan, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia.

- The African region reported 1.4% of daily case numbers and 2.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.1 million cases. South Africa is again the dominant country, followed by Ethiopia, Uganda, Mozambique, Algeria, Nigeria, and Kenya.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.6% of daily case numbers and 2.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.57 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 32.9% of the daily newly reported cases and 23.0% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 6.0 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Myanmar.

Today's report from Europe has weekend reporting artifact with key countries not reporting new cases in the past 24 hours. That being said, Europe is experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period. In the Americas more countries are reporting more than 1000 cases per day (Ecuador, Paraguay, Costa Rica, and Puerto Rico to mention some. Major transmission is also ongoing in South East Asia, specifically India, with record-breaking daily case reports but other countries are following suit -- cases are increasing in Myanmar.

[The USA, India, and Brazil are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations, with India now in the 2nd position followed by Brazil. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (87 382), followed by the USA (37 365) and Brazil (16 282) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.5%) and 57.3% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 3661 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (19-20 Sep 2020). The decreases in 24-hour new case reports along with the lower 24-hour reported deaths in these 3 countries are consistent with the pattern of weekend reporting artifacts.

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, France (10 569), Argentina (8431), Colombia (6678), and Russia (6148); 30 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. 6 of the 20 top countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the Americas region and 6 of the top 20 countries reporting the highest daily newly confirmed cases are from the European region. Countries not reporting new cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Peru, Sweden, Costa Rica, Switzerland, and Kyrgyzstan.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase in case counts by 8.0%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 9.8%.
