Nearly 40 000 horses in NSW affected by equine flu
----------------------------------------------------------
The number of horses infected by equine influenza in New South Wales
stands at 38 459, according to New South Wales Primary Industries
Minister Ian Macdonald. The number of infected properties stands are
4622.

The minister urged horse owners to rally to beat the disease, saying
ignorance or indifference about biosecurity by some individuals is
increasing the impact of the disease on every horse owner.

"To stop these figures growing, all horse owners and individuals
involved in our horse industries must be 100 percent committed to
proper biosecurity. This means adopting simple measures such as hand
washing and changing clothes after contact with horses or horse
equipment. Horse owners must use decontamination procedures before
leaving infected properties otherwise they risk infecting clean
properties," he said.

"Seven weeks since the outbreak of EI, it's now more important than
ever to work together in a cohesive approach to contain and eradicate
this disease from one end of NSW to the other.

"The fact that horse flu has unexpectedly popped up in new locations
shows that some people have been in contact with infected horses,
then moved to EI free areas without following disinfection
guidelines," he said. "Simple measures would help bring EI under
control."

People who don't abide by mandatory decontamination procedures face a
fine of up to AUD 22 000 [USD 19 546] or up to 6 months imprisonment.

Mr Macdonald praised horse owners around Mudgee, whose commitment to
biosecurity has allowed the buffer zone around a seat of infection to
be dropped to 2km [1.24 miles] from 10km [6.21 miles]. "Instead of
needing to vaccinate 2840 animals in the old buffer area, we now have
to vaccinate only 300."

In Queensland, a working party of performance and pleasure horse
industry representatives has been formed to work with the state
government to help co-ordinate efforts in the campaign to control
equine flu. The committee includes representatives from areas as
diverse as pony clubs, horse exporters and saddle retailers. The
Queensland Horse Council is also represented.

Queensland Primary Industries Minister Tim Mulherin said the group
would help get key information about biosecurity measures and
assistance programs to this group of stakeholders and respond to
their concerns.

"This working party is a major step forward in enabling the
Government to work with a wide range of industries affected by equine
influenza," he said. "This group will ensure that there is effective
2-way communication. Many of the people which this group represents
do not have computers to enable them access information and updates
about equine flu on the internet. This has been identified as a gap
and we are addressing it."

Mr Mulherin said it was vital that Queenslanders continued to use
proper biosecurity practices.

"We have contained this highly contagious virus in the red zone and
we are still confident of keeping it contained, so that it will burn
itself out," he said. "There continues to be a strong commitment
nationally and in Queensland to eradicating this disease."

The commitment to eradication is based on the fact that, although the
current response is costly, it would be far more damaging and costly
having to deal with re-occurrences of the disease on an ongoing basis.

He said the vaccination program is proceeding on schedule with horses
in the buffer zone receiving top priority, along with high risk, and
high value horses in the red zone.

Queensland has 1220 infected properties, across a total area of 2766
sq km [1068 sq miles] in the state's south-east.

[It will be interesting to see how many fines they collect. It seems
they will be depending on owners to report friends and associates. Or
they will be spending a lot of time and money to do the bioforensics
necessary to track down who violated the biosecurity issues. - Mod.TG]
