It can appear to be a beautiful day at the beach when the sun is shining, kids are playing and dolphins occasionally pop up as they swim by... but there are unseen dangers lurking throughout the Gulf of Mexico. _Vibrio vulnificus_ is a common bacteria found in warm salt water and can cause disease in people if exposed to open wounds or ingested.

Just about 2 weeks ago, an 84-year-old woman was boating off Hernando Channel near Pine Island [Lee County, Florida], when she scraped her shin climbing aboard a boat. Infection set in and doctors had to amputate her right leg just above the knee. Her daughter says the unexpected incident has been horrible. "It's devastating. I mean, one day you're out on the water having a good time, and 3 days later your mother's leg is off, and her life is in the balance." Complicated by the trauma, she suffered a heart attack and failing kidneys in the process. She is now on a ventilator.

The health department does not want to scare people from going out and enjoying the water; however, they do want folks to be aware of what's out there, and who is at risk. "People who have a decreased immune system are more prone to be affected by this bacterium. It may move into their blood system more easily."

The daughter said her mother was in good health before their nice day on the water turned into a life-threatening nightmare. "My mom is 84, but she is completely healthy; the only thing she had is arthritis," explained the daughter, before warning, "I just want everyone to be aware you should not go out there with open wounds."

Direct sea water exposure and uncooked shellfish ingestion are the most common modes of acquisition of _V. vulnificus_. The organism's presence in sea water is not the result of sewage contamination but rather it is normal flora, especially during the warmer summer months.

The following report shows that treatment of oysters prior to ingestion can decrease the risk from ingestion. - Mod.LL]

Since 2003, raw oysters harvested from the Gulf of Mexico in warmer months cannot be sold in California unless they have undergone treatment to reduce _Vibrio vulnificus_, and this regulation "led to a significant reduction in reported raw oyster-associated _V. vulnificus_ illnesses and deaths," according to a report online.

Duc J. Vugia, MD, MPH, chief of the infectious diseases branch at the California Department of Public Health, and colleagues, reviewed surveillance data on _V. vulnificus_ infections reported between 1991 and 2002, and then after the treatment implementation. The researchers said, "The annual number of reported _V. vulnificus_ infections and deaths in California with patient's sole exposure to raw oysters dropped from 0 to 6 cases and 0 to 5 deaths per year during 1991-2002, before implementation, to zero during 2003-2010, after implementation (P=.0005 for both)."

Meanwhile, in other states, where similar actions were not taken to reduce infection, cases actually increased, the researchers said, adding that education efforts on the dangers of undercooked seafood have not been sufficient to reduce raw oyster consumption.

The methods utilized to decrease _V. vulnificus_ levels to "nondetectable" levels, which is defined nationally as a most probable number of less than 30 organisms/gm oyster meat are 1 of 3 postharvest processing methods that are commercially available: 1) individual quick freezing, by which half-shell oysters were rapidly frozen, 2) mild heat-cool pasteurization, by which oysters are heated in warm water and then dipped in cold water to stop the process, and 3) high hydrostatic pressure processing, in which oysters are subjected to pressure less than 45 000 pounds per square inch. - Mod.LL]
