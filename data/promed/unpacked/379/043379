Authorities in Nepal are grappling to contain the rapid rise of COVID-19 cases with experts fearing that thousands of people in the Himalayan state have caught the more infectious mutant strains emerging out of India.

Nepal, which shares a long porous border with India, reported 3032 new infections on [Sun 25 Apr 2021], the highest daily number recorded this year [2021]. It took the total caseload since the pandemic 1st struck Nepal to 300 119 with 3164 deaths so far, according to government data.

"We have detected the UK variant and the double mutant variant detected in India," Krishna Prasad Paudel, the director of Nepal's Epidemiology and Disease Control Department Paudel told Reuters news agency, adding that experts were checking for other variants too.

Nepal launched its vaccination campaign in January [2021] and gave shots to 1.9 million people, all provided by India and China. But health experts feared that continuation of the vaccination drive was uncertain after officials had failed to procure more doses from India or any other source.

More than 90 developing nations, including Nepal, rely on India - home to the Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine maker - for the doses to protect their own populations, but India has now prioritised its own needs as a 2nd wave of the epidemic there rages out of control.

"The virus is mutating very fast...what started in India has now entered Nepal too," said Rabindra Pandey, a public health expert, adding that if the trend continued for a week, new patients would be unable to find beds as hospitals were already stretched.

Wedged between China and India, Nepal shares a 1751 km (1094 mi) border with its southern neighbour India. The border was closed for some time during a lockdown last year [2020] when the 1st wave of the epidemic struck, but it has since been reopened.

Nepal's former King Gyanendra and his wife, who tested positive for the virus after returning from India where they attended a religious festival, were undergoing treatment at a private facility in Kathmandu.

"The situation is really frightening," said Prakash Thapa, a doctor at Bheri hospital in Nepalgunj, a city in the southwest plains bordering India. He said the hospital was inundated with coronavirus patients requiring intensive care and ventilators. "This time even children and young people are brought in critical condition and patients are even sleeping on the floor and corridors," he said.

Nepal's ruling Communist Party has been embroiled in a power struggle for months, and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has been criticised for his response to the crisis.

Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali told reporters on [Sun 25 Apr 2021] that despite the surge in cases, a nationwide lockdown was not required.

Nepal's economy contracted for the 1st time in 4 decades in the last fiscal year [2020] due to a months-long lockdown to contain the pandemic.

In February [2021], it seemed like India had gotten Covid-19 under control, with daily cases falling nearly 90% from the peak of the 1st wave last year [2020]. Now, the country is experiencing the world's worst outbreak. Daily cases have been rising continuously for the past 10 days; on [Mon 26 Apr 2021], India reported 352 991 new cases, breaking yet another record for the highest single-day figure globally.

On the ground, these numbers translate to heart wrenching tragedy. Photos show grieving families dressed in full protective suits at mass cremations, performing last rites surrounded by dozens of other burning funeral pyres. Hospitals have run out of basic medical supplies, with many patients dying due to oxygen shortages. Family members are driving from clinic to clinic, frantically searching for open ICU beds for their loved ones.

The government has been scrambling to respond to the crisis, with countries around the world offering aid. But for now, the outbreak shows no signs of letting up, and experts warn it could get even worse. "I'm afraid this is not the peak," said Dr. Giridhara R. Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India on [Mon 26 Apr 2021]. "The kind of data that we see, (we are) at least 2 to 3 weeks away from the peak."

Others say India may be approaching the peak now, sooner than Babu's estimate -- but with so many ill and so few supplies available, the country will see many more deaths before the second wave subsides.

Here's what you need to know about the crisis in India.

How did it get so bad?
----------------------
Cases began creeping upward in early March [2021], but accelerated rapidly -- the number of daily cases by the end of the month had jumped 6 times higher than at the start of the month. That exponential rise has only continued with increasing speed and severity.

The 2nd wave hit so much harder because people were unprepared, experts say. The 1st wave peaked in September [2020] and daily cases declined steadily in the following months; the apparent recovery seemed so successful that the country's health minister declared in early March [2021] they were "in the endgame" of the pandemic. And the country's vaccination drive, among the world's largest and most ambitious, got underway in January [2021].

Residents relaxed Covid-safe practices like social distancing, and authorities were looser in their enforcement. Although some states stayed cautious and made preparations for a 2nd wave, none of it was enough -- and nobody foresaw the massive coming wave.

"No one saw the extent of the surge," said K. VijayRaghavan, principal scientific adviser for the Indian government. "As the previous wave came down, there was in all of us a feeling that this was something which had been dealt with substantially. We saw signs of a next surge, but the scale and the intensity of it was not clear."

Where is it happening?
----------------------
New Delhi, the national capital, has been badly hit by the 2nd wave. The union territory of Delhi, where New Delhi is located, was placed under lockdown on 19 Apr. The lockdown has since been extended until [3 May 2021].

Hospitals across Delhi are reporting fatal oxygen shortages. On [23 Apr 2021], 20 critically ill patients died at the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Delhi after its supply of oxygen was delayed by 7 hours, according to the hospital's medical director. "Everything we had was exhausted," said Dr. DK Baluja. "The oxygen was not supplied on time. It was supposed to come in at 5 p.m. but it came around midnight. People who were critically ill needed oxygen."

The western state of Maharashtra has also been hard hit, with a number of restrictions in place. Public gatherings have been capped at 4 people, and public transit across districts and within cities has been limited to essential services and "unavoidable events" like funerals. The entire state is imposing weekend lockdowns through the end of the month.

Several other states also reporting the highest number of active cases include Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.

Who's being affected?
---------------------
Though current Covid patients span nearly every age group, this 2nd wave appears to be infecting young people more than before, experts say. "The virus and its 2nd wave is hitting the younger people, and even children, in a way it had not in its 1st wave," said Barkha Dutt, an author and journalist based in New Delhi. "We've met 18-day-old babies that are fighting for their lives inside ICUs."

Part of it could have to do with India being a young country, said Dr. Lancelot Pinto, a consultant pulmonologist at P.D. Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai. The median age of the population is 27, which means that when there's a virus affecting the whole country at such a high speed, "there are bound to be a lot of young people coming to the hospital."

There is the possibility that the higher number of younger patients during this 2nd wave could be related to the virus itself, or its variants -- but there simply isn't enough information or data yet to point to a specific cause.

The highest mortality, however, is still seen among patients aged 70 and above, said Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India -- "which means that we need to be protecting the elderly by providing critical care."

What about the variants?
------------------------
There is a correlation between the current surge and the rise of the "Indian variant," according to the country's top epidemiological experts.

"In Maharashtra we saw [the variant 1st identified in India] go up, we saw an outbreak. We are seeing it go up in Delhi, we are seeing an outbreak," said Anurag Agrawal, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, at a webinar on [Fri 23 Apr 2021]. "These are very important epidemiological correlations."

"It's also important to keep in mind that these variants have spread a lot," said VijayRaghavan. "They constitute, by some estimates, about 60% in one state, Maharashtra." The proportion of variant cases could be similar in Delhi, as well as other regions in the coming weeks, he added.

Scientists are still studying the variant [1st identified in India] and conducting genome sequencing to determine what effect, if any, the mutation has. But some experts warn the new variants pose a clear risk, observable even before formal data has been collected.

Crowded areas in hard-hit cities that saw nearly 50% antibody levels during the 1st wave are now still reporting positivity rates of more than 25%, said Babu. "Clearly, it means that any protection against the earlier variant is not really useful because of the newer variant spreading faster."

What's happening with vaccines?
-------------------------------

India is administering 2 vaccines domestically: the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, known as Covishield in India, and its homegrown Covaxin, developed jointly by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). In mid-April [2021], India also approved Russia's Sputnik V vaccine.

The country started its vaccination program in January [2021] for health care workers and priority groups -- and marked its 100th day on [25 Apr 2021]-- with the goal of fully inoculating 300 million people by August [2021]. But the program had a sluggish start, facing logistical issues as well as vaccine hesitancy among the population, especially towards Covaxin, which was approved for emergency use before the efficacy data of its 3rd phase trial were released.

As of [25 Apr 2021], India had administered 140.9 million doses of vaccines against Covid-19, according to the health ministry. Despite administering the most number of coronavirus vaccines in the world after the United States and China, India ranks lower than many countries in per capita vaccination, according to CNN data.

Earlier in April [2021], the central government said it would fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines already approved by the World Health Organization or authorities in the US, Europe, Britain and Japan. Companies still need to apply for approval in India, but they will be exempt from having to conduct local safety trials, expediting the process.

Starting [1 May 2021], all residents over the age of 18 will be eligible for vaccination. Private vaccination providers will also be able to sell and administer vaccines.

But state ministers have criticized the new measures, pointing out there simply aren't enough vaccines even if more people become eligible. The chief minister of West Bengal called the decision "hollow, without substance and a regrettable show of evasion of responsibility by the central government at a time of crisis," adding it could lead to "unscrupulous mechanisms" regarding pricing in the market.

What is the government doing?
-----------------------------
The central government leaped into action in late April [2021] as the extent of the crisis became clear. On [20 Apr 2021], in his address to the nation, Modi said the government was working to deliver 100 000 new oxygen cylinders to states, and that it was suspending all oxygen use for industrial purposes to free up supply for medical use.

Work is underway to increase the number of hospital beds, and to build dedicated Covid hospitals in some cities, he said. In his address, Modi urged states to avoid imposing lockdowns if possible, calling such measures the "last option."

India's health minister said on [Sat 24 Apr 2021] that the central government has provided Delhi with more oxygen "than they had asked for," and urged people not to seek hospitalizations "with the slightest panic -- this is not required." The next day [Sun 25 Apr 2021], Modi expanded on the ongoing efforts, saying his administration would set up 551 oxygen generation plants "in every district to ensure adequate oxygen availability." The government is now exploring how to use railways and the Air Force most effectively so that oxygen tankers reach local centers as soon as possible.

How has the world responded?
----------------------------
Countries around the world have stepped up to offer critical aid.

The Biden administration and the US Defense Department will deploy supplies and support to India, including sending ventilators, PPE, rapid diagnostic test kits, and therapeutics, according to the White House and senior officials. "The United States also is pursuing options to provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis," according to a readout of a call between the 2 countries' national security advisers.

The US has a temporary ban in place on exporting raw materials critical for vaccine production -- but the White House announced it would partially lift it by identifying "specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India."

On [Mon 26 Apr 2021], the White House said it could share up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine -- which the US currently has stockpiled -- with other countries in the coming months, assuming the US Food and Drug Administration issues an emergency use authorization for that vaccine. However, a senior Biden administration official said that Modi did not make a specific request for vaccines when he spoke with President Biden on [Mon 26 Apr 2021], and it remains unclear if the unused AstraZeneca doses will be sent to India. Multiple world leaders have pressed Biden to share doses as other countries have struggled to ramp up vaccinations.

The United Kingdom is also sending 600 pieces of medical equipment to India, including oxygen concentrators and ventilators, the government announced on [Sun 25 Apr 2021]. The aid follows a direct request by Modi to the UK.

India is also importing 23 mobile oxygen generation plants and containers from Germany, which will be airlifted and arrive in India within a week. The supplies will be deployed to military hospitals treating Covid-19 patients, said India's defense ministry on [Fri 23 Apr 2021].

Neighboring Pakistan, which has a long and hostile history with India, announced it would provide "relief support" including ventilators, PPE and other medical assistance. "I want to express our solidarity with the people of India as they battle a dangerous wave of Covid-19," said Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan in a statement on [Sat 24 Apr 2021]. "Our prayers for a speedy recovery go to all those suffering from the pandemic," said Khan. "We must fight this global challenge confronting humanity together."

Several countries over the weekend resoundingly answered India's pleas for help with its massive COVID-19 surge --the worst of the pandemic-- including the United States, which announced it will supply a raw material India urgently needs to make its Covishield vaccine.

India had asked the European Union for oxygen and remdesivir, and the European Commission said it has started the steps to send oxygen and medicine, according to Reuters. Separately, Germany said it will send oxygen and medical aid, and the United Kingdom said it would send oxygen concentrators and ventilators, with the 1st shipment to arrive in New Delhi as early as tomorrow.

Saudi Arabia is sending liquid oxygen, tanks, and oxygen cylinders, and help is also coming from Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Australia, and several other countries, according to India Today.

Global health officials had pinned hopes for millions of doses produced by India's Serum Institute to power the COVAX program, a World Health Organization (WHO)-led effort to equitably distribute vaccine supplies. However, when India's outbreak intensified over the past weeks, in a desperate attempt to immunize more of its own population, it delayed global shipments so that the country could manage its own crisis.

The U.S. announced on [Mon 26 Apr 2021] that it would share its entire supply of AstraZeneca Plc's Covid-19 vaccine with other countries and readied an aid package for India, as President Joe Biden pivots to ramp up U.S. pandemic assistance to the rest of the world.

The decision would make as many as 60 million vaccine doses available for export in coming months, if they clear a federal safety review. The plan represents a shift for Biden, who has hesitated to give vaccine doses and materials to other countries while focusing on ensuring Americans are vaccinated first.

"Given AstraZeneca is not authorized for use in the United States, we do not need to use AstraZeneca in our fight against Covid over the next few months," @PressSec said.

The U.S. had announced on [Sun 25 Apr 2021] that it would send raw materials for vaccines to India and step up funding for the country to manufacture more doses. Ventilators, therapeutics, rapid testing kits and personal protective equipment will be sent as well, the White House said. While vaccine doses were not included, the U.S. is sending a supply of remdesivir, an anti-viral drug used to treat hospitalized Covid-19 patients, a senior administration official said."

[It appears now that vaccine doses also will be sent. It is critical that countries that have the resources available share those with less developed countries. If we can't achieve equity in vaccination, the outbreak will continue to surge in countries without vaccines available and consequently extremely low vaccination rates. There is unacceptable inequity not only among different groups of people in each country, but also between countries. The existing inequities are being exacerbated by COVID-19. - Mod.LK]

Gilead Sciences Inc. pledged to donate at least 450 000 vials of Remdesivir to the government of India and said it will provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the medicine to help scale up production in the country in response to the rapid increase of cases.

The company is also providing its voluntary licensing partners with technical assistance and supporting the addition of new local manufacturing facilities, Gilead said in a statement.

"The recent surge of Covid-19 cases in India is having a devastating impact on communities and has created unprecedented pressure on health systems," said Johanna Mercier, Chief Commercial Officer at Gilead. "We are committed to doing our part to help tackle this crisis."

Remdesivir is approved in India for restricted emergency use for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed Covid-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/26/qa-how-qatar-is-battling-a-new-wave-of-covid-cases-deaths


More than 200 000 people in Qatar have tested positive for the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic last year [2020].

The country has also reported 428 deaths as of [26 Apr 2021], including 150 in the last 30 days, following a spike in the daily cases and number of casualties.

It has administered more than 1.4 million doses of the vaccine, with just over 19% of the population having received both doses, according to officials.

Earlier this month [April 2021], Qatar announced tighter COVID-19-related restrictions amidst a rising number of cases in the last few weeks.

Al Jazeera spoke to Dr. Abdullatif Al Khal, the chair of the National Health Strategic Group on COVID-19 and head of Infectious Diseases at Hamad Medical Corporation (HMC) on the reason behind the spike and the authorities' strategies to minimise the effects of the 2nd wave.

Al Jazeera: Qatar witnessed a surge in cases in February [202] and a steeper one in March [2021]. The numbers kept rising after that. What is the reason behind the spike?

Abdullatif Al Khal: Like many countries around the world, we are now experiencing another wave of the virus. The increase has been driven by the spread of the strains [first detected in UK and South Africa]. The variant [first detected in] UK has been circulating in the community since March [2021]. Despite our strict quarantine policy that is in place for all travellers, the variant [first detected in South Africa] made its way into the community at the start of April [2021].

Both these strains are more infectious and cause more severe disease than the original strain and we believe they have had a significant impact on the rise in COVID cases.

Al Jazeera: Stricter restrictions were announced earlier this month [April 2021]. Should that have been done earlier given the spike?

Al Khal: Qatar has acted proactively throughout the entire pandemic. Despite managing to keep the virus under control throughout the last quarter of 2020, Qatar maintained a set of strict policies aimed at preventing a 2nd wave. Our quarantine policy for anyone entering Qatar has been one of the strictest of its kind in the world and was proven effective at delaying the introduction of new variants into Qatar at a time when many countries around the world were being affected by these new strains. Additionally, we continued to keep in place preventive measures to prevent the virus from spreading.

A key principle of our COVID-19 strategy remains ensuring we are proactive. At the start of the year [2021], as we saw the number of new daily cases begin to rise steadily, we acted quickly to introduce further restrictions at the beginning of February [2021]. Once we identified the UK variant, we moved quickly to escalate the restrictions. The latest development in this pandemic of the circulation of the South African variant at the start of April [2021] meant we once again moved quickly to further increase the restrictions.

Al Jazeera: There have been calls for another lockdown. Is Qatar heading towards something similar to the one witnessed last year [2020]?

Al Khal: The latest set of restrictions implemented on [9 Apr 2021] were the 3rd set of new restrictions to be introduced this year [2021]. While economic factors are important, these decisions are always made with the health of the population as the priority.

When announced, we committed to the latest restrictions for a period of at least 3 weeks. We are now 18 days into the restrictions and we continue to closely monitor the data to see the impact of the restrictions. While it is too early to make firm predictions, the data shows that the hospital admission rates have levelled off and even seen a slight decline in the past few days. This is very encouraging and the first indication that the combination of restrictions as well as vaccination rollout is working to interrupt the spread of the virus.

However, should the data show signs of rising numbers of cases again then we would not hesitate to increase the restrictions further.

Al Jazeera: COVID cases within children are rising now. How worrying is that and is that as a result of schools being kept open?

Al Khal: It is clear that the variants [first detected in] South African and UK are affecting people of a younger age than the original strain. It is very worrying when children are affected by the virus, but to date we have seen a very low proportion of children become severely sick due to COVID-19. Our policy on schools has always been very strict - even when cases remained low throughout the last quarter of 2020, schools operated with a blended learning system.

This ensured reduced class sizes in schools and supported the implementation of preventive measures. All teachers, administrative staff and almost all children are required to wear masks, while social distancing is maintained and 'Ehteraz' [official contact-tracing app] and temperature checks are done on entry to school grounds, with schools implementing a bubble system where classes don't mix with one another.

We have also implemented a strict quarantine policy for all confirmed and suspected cases - children and teachers. Additionally, we prioritised the vaccination of teachers and school staff and have a very high percentage of vaccination coverage within this group.

With 88 days until the Tokyo Olympics, a "4th wave" of the pandemic has hit Japan.

Driving the news
----------------
Bars, department stores and theaters across Japan will remain closed for 17 days, after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared a state of emergency for Tokyo and 3 other prefectures.
- A senior member of Japan's ruling party recently questioned Tokyo's ability to host the Games and said cancellation is still an option.
- The Olympic torch relay has been detoured several times since it began on [25 Mar 2021] and will be banned altogether this weekend.

The state of play
-----------------
The surge in infections and Olympics concerns have put a spotlight on Japan's lagging vaccine rollout.
- As of last week, Japan had administered just over 2 million vaccine shots, which is roughly 1% of its population, per Forbes [https://fortune.com/2021/04/23/japan-covid-vaccine-rollout-slow-behind-tokyo-olympics-2020/?utm_source= newsletter&utm_medium= email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiossports&stream=top]
- The U.S., by comparison, has administered nearly 230 million shots, enough for 42% of Americans to get one dose.

What's next
-----------
Tokyo organizers and the IOC will unveil a new "playbook" this week, explaining how the Olympics and Paralympics will safely welcome 15 400 athletes, AP reports [https://apnews.com/article/tokyo-osaka-coronavirus-pandemic-japan-olympic-games-decc758d3740b0100ed91f77da58dc1f?utm_source= newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=newsletter_axiossports&stream=top].

[The decision whether to go forward with the Olympics is going down to the wire. Games Tokyo 2020 is scheduled to start on 23 July 2021. With approximately 1% of the Japan's population vaccinated, it seems highly risky to the athletes and those in attendance to hold the games, as disappointing as that will be. According to The Guardian, "The health ministry has so far approved only the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, leaving Japan dependent on imports from the EU until the AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines are given the green light, possibly next month [May 2021]" https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/26/japans-slow-covid-vaccine-rollout-casts-cloud-over-tokyo-olympics. There doesn't seem to be adequate time to achieve a level of immunity that would be safe for the games to proceed. - Mod.LK]
