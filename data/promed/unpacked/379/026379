Bluetongue: Latest situation
----------------------------
Since 22 Sep 2007, laboratory tests have detected the presence of
Bluetongue in a small number of animals on a number of different
premises in Suffolk. These premises are all under restrictions and
the infected animals have been culled. Defra confirmed on 28 Sep 2007
that Bluetongue disease is circulating between the local animal and
midge population in East Anglia.
As at 5pm on 5 Oct 2007 there were 26 confirmed premises affected by
Bluetongue. This figure will normally be updated once daily (Monday
to Friday). The cases of bluetongue remain within the Bluetongue
Control Zone and are located in a cluster in the Ipswich area, with
further cases just over the Essex border and near Lowestoft.

[A continuous spread of the virus in south-eastern England is
expected during the coming weeks. It remains to see if the disease
will subside during the winter months.
During the meeting of EU's SCFCAH (Standing Committee on the Food
Chain and Animal Health), section "Animal Health and Animal Welfare",
held in Brussels earlier this week (3-4 Oct 2007), the UK delegation
presented the report "Bluetongue type 8 in East Anglia: Situation on
1st October". It included, among others, data on herd prevalence,
namely 0.5 - 10.0 percent. Unfortunately, no case fatality data, in
the various affected species, were included. The report is available
at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/bt_23102007_uk.pdf>.

The EC Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health
(SCFCAH), section "Animal Health and Animal Welfare", held a meeting
in Brussels earlier this week (3-4 Oct 2007). Separate presentations
on their respective updated BTV-8 bluetongue situations were
presented by the following countries (in brackets, affected
holdings): Belgium (4138), France (1698), Germany (11 321),
Luxembourg (940) and Netherlands (5051). The UK presentation was
discussed in item 1 above.
Subscribers are encouraged to visit the above URL and download the
presentations, which include interesting data on the geography and
epidemiology of the BTV-8 epizootic, laboratory findings and
entomological observations. Interestingly, the German presentation
mentions, in addition to the outbreaks in sheep (5627) and cattle
(5619), also several outbreaks affecting wildlife: "bovines" (10),
mouflons (5), fallow-deer (2) and deer (probably red deer, 2).
Unfortunately, the various countries have not included information on
the herd prevalence of the infection or disease, nor on the case
fatality rate in the various affected species. Number of mortalities
are included in the Luxembourg report.
Hopefully, the EC will collect such data and make them publicly available.
The website includes also presentations from Portugal and Spain on
their respective BT situations.
