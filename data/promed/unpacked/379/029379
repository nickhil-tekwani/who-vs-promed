[Between July and October 2017, a total of 12 West Nile fever outbreaks in animals were reported in Greece's provinces Peloponnesus (9), Crete (2) and Central Macedonia (1). The event affected 13 cases out of 52 susceptible equines. The event was resolved on 31 Dec 2017. See event summary and updated map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=24448.

"West Nile virus is a mosquitoborne flavivirus that is maintained in an enzootic cycle between mosquitoes and birds. Humans and horses are incidental dead-end hosts. Most human infections are asymptomatic and the majority of clinical cases of WN infections are mild and present with flu-like symptoms, including fever, headache and body aches. In more severe cases, most often observed among elderly, there may be signs of encephalitis, meningo-encephalitis or meningitis. In Europe, West Nile virus outbreaks are erratic and spatially and temporally limited phenomena, occurring quite unpredictably, even if all conditions appear to be present in a definite place. The disease is under surveillance at European Union level. There is no specific treatment for West Nile virus infection and a vaccine is not available. The best way to prevent West Nile virus infection is to avoid mosquito bites" (https://ecdc.europa.eu/en/west-nile-fever/facts/factsheet-about-west-nile-fever).

According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control [ECDC] - Communicable disease threats report (week 28, 8-14 Jul 2018):
"During the West Nile virus transmission season (June to November), ECDC monitors the occurrence of West Nile fever cases in EU/EEA [European Economic Area] member states and neighbouring countries on a weekly basis in order to inform blood safety authorities of areas where there is ongoing virus transmission. During the 2017 transmission season, 288 human cases were reported in the EU and from neighbouring countries. No cases were reported from EEA countries. EU member states reported 127 equine cases.

"Between 6 and 12 Jul 2018, 5 cases of human West Nile fever were reported in the EU. Greece reported one confirmed case in Thessaloniki and one probable case in Voiotia. Italy reported 3 confirmed cases, 2 in Modena and one in Rovigo. The human case reported in Austria in the previous week is currently not confirmed and under investigation for further confirmation. Serbia reported 9 confirmed human cases. All human cases were reported from regions that were also affected in previous transmission seasons."
