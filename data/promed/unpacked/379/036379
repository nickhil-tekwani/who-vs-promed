There is no cure for yellow fever [YF], but immunizing broad swaths of the population -- at least 70 per cent in at-risk areas -- effectively thwarted outbreaks of the mosquitoborne disease after the vaccine was introduced in the 1930s.

That control is now threatened, thanks to lapses in immunization coverage. Currently, there are an estimated 200 000 yellow fever cases annually, with 30 000 deaths. Africa, which contains 14 of the 17 high-risk countries, shoulders 90 per cent of the deaths. A vaccine shortfall further threatens the coverage; UNICEF says that the world is only producing about 35 million of the 64 million doses needed. "The resurgence of yellow fever in Africa is a classic tale of complacency: not only the routine immunizations aren't kept up with [at] the required levels, but the vaccine supply doesn't match the world's requirements," writes reporter Annalisa Merelli.

The Gates Foundation has stepped up with an investment to ensure that the Institut Pasteur de Dakar, the manufacturer of vaccine in Senegal, can up the supply, however.

[The YF vaccine shortage is a serious concern. Africa has suffered significant YF outbreaks, some in the recent past. Because the sylvan (forest) cycle is endemic in Africa and South America, without adequate YF vaccination coverage, there is a real risk of the virus spilling over from the sylvan into the urban and peri-urban populations if they are not immune. Fortunately, the Gates Foundation has stepped up and is financing vaccine production that will be very important, especially in Africa. However, there needs to be a well-integrated system of vaccine production and administration in populations that have less than 70-80 per cent coverage. In Africa, it will be difficult to halt issuance of fake YF vaccination cards or issuance of cards without application of the vaccine if the vaccine is not available because of the shortage. - Mod.TY]
