Cholera epidemic in Kazan localized
-----------------------------------
An outbreak of an epidemic of cholera in Kazan has been localized, and the
situation has been brought under control, said Russia's chief sanitary
doctor Gennady Onischenko on Thursday.
The Kazan headquarters supervising the cholera situation told Itar-Tass
that the number of cholera victims had risen to 47 after 5 of 210 people
hospitalized tested positive to the cholera [bacteria. Of those who
developed cholera, 8 have fully recovered now. By Thursday, 13 patients who
had contact with cholera-infected people had left the hospital. No more
cholera patients have been admitted to hospitals in the past 2 days,
Onischenko said.
Unprecedented preventive measures have been taken in Kazan in order to
overhaul the city sewage system. After an outbreak of cholera much more
funds had to be raised, and expenditures are much higher than needed for
maintenance purposes, Onischenko said.
