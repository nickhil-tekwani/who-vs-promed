1st report of rice yellow mottle virus in rice in Uganda

Rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) of the genus _Sobemovirus_ is a major
biotic constraint to rice production in Africa. First reported in Kenya in
1966, RYMV was later found in most countries in Africa where rice (_Oryza
sativa_) is grown (2). During July 2000, plants with leaf yellowing and
mottling symptoms were observed in Uganda in a subsistence rice field north
east of Lake Victoria, close to the Nile River. RYMV was detected by using
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with polyclonal RYMV antisera (1) in the
4 samples collected. Discriminant monoclonal antibodies revealed that the
samples contained RYMV serotype 4, a serotype found in eastern Africa
(Madagascar, Kenya, and Tanzania) (2). The 720-nt long coat protein gene of
2 isolates was amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
and sequenced (1).
The 2 Ugandan isolates had 99 per cent nt sequence identity (EMBL Accession
Nos. AM114523 and AM114524). They belonged to a monophyletic group (97 per
cent nt identity) containing isolates from eastern Kenya and northern
Tanzania (close to the Lake Victoria). These form a sister group (93 per
cent identity) of isolates from Lake Malawi Region in western Tanzania and
are more distantly related (88 per cent identity) to the basal strains from
eastern Tanzania (2).
Isolation of the Lake Victoria Region from the rest of the Tanzania by
distance, physical barriers, and patchy rice cultivation explains the
specificity of the strain. Year-round growth of wild and cultivated rice
around the lake ensures host continuity in time and space, which
facilitates spread that accounts for the homogeneity of the isolates of
this area. Knowledge of the presence of RYMV in Uganda is important, since
rice cultivation is intensified in this country and is planned in
neighboring southern Sudan.

[The crop plant rice, _Oryza sativa_, develops symptoms of the disease
yellow mottle when infected by the virus rice yellow mottle virus (genus:
_Sobemovirus_, RYMV). Symptoms include stunting, reduced tillering,
mottling and yellowish streaking of the leaves, delayed flowering or
incomplete emergence of the panicles and, in extreme cases, death of
plants. The disease is a major constraint to rice production in Africa.
RYMV was 1st reported in Kenya in 1966 and later found in most countries in
Africa where rice is grown. RYMV is transmitted mechanically and by
chrysomelid beetles but not by seed (a property of some _Sobemoviruses_).
_Chaetocnema pulla Chapuis_ is thought to be an important vector of the
disease in Tanzania. Much of the spread may not be due to transmission by
beetles but rather by mechanical inoculation. Very few rice varieties are
resistant to RYMV. The highest level of resistance was provided by a
cultivar of _Oryza sativa indica_, "Gigante," and a few cultivars of _Oryza
glaberrima_ series Tog. These varieties showed a natural high resistance
characterized by a low virus titre and the absence of symptoms.
In this 1st report of RYMV in Uganda, 4 samples were collected from
symptomatic plants growing in a subsistence rice field north east of Lake
Victoria, close to the Nile River, in 2000. The samples contained RYMV
serotype 4, a serotype found in eastern Africa (Madagascar, Kenya, and
Tanzania). It differs from (88 per cent identity) the basal strains from
eastern Tanzania.
Rice is a relatively new crop in Uganda. It was introduced on a large scale
in the 1960s and is now widely grown in many parts of the country,
especially in the eastern and northern regions. To meet the increasing
demand for rice, Uganda imports about USD 100 million worth of rice every
year. The presence of RYMV will not be good news for those making efforts
to increase rice production in Uganda, including expansions into the upland
areas.
