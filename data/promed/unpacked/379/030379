Is this not Konzo, caused by inadequate preparation of cassava?
If cassava is not left to stand for an adequate length of time its cyanide
content is not degraded, resulting in cord damage and death in severe
cases. This typically happens during droughts or civil disturbances.

[Konzo is also known as tropical spastic paresis & has been reported
previously in the Democratic Republic of the Congo -- see ref. above.
Epidemics there, the first of which was reported in Bandundu province
in 1936, have coincided with food shortages that led to protein-
deficient diets and shortcuts in cassava processing. Women of child-
bearing age and children aged between 3-13 years were at greatest risk
of paralysis. - Mod.JW
