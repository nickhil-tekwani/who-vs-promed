The Infectious Diseases Hospital allegedly received more than 30 hepatitis A patients within a short period, according to Annahar [newspaper]. Sources revealed that the Preventive Medicine Department has been trying to find reasons behind the spread of the disease for 3 weeks but until now no result has been announced.

Meanwhile, health experts have advised the public to refrain from eating fast-food meals to prevent further spread of the disease. They believe the epidemic is local as it might have started amongst some patients who probably consumed contaminated food.

The experts said hepatitis A symptoms include feeling cold at the beginning, followed by a sudden rise in temperature and liver enzyme levels, in addition to yellowish eyes.

[Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by hepatitis A virus, transmitted primarily by the faecal-oral route. Hepatitis A virus is one of the most frequent causes of foodborne infection. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage-contaminated or inadequately treated water. The virus can also be transmitted through close physical contact with an infectious person, although casual contact among people does not spread the virus.

Although this outbreak of 30 cases of hepatitis A virus infection is being attributed to foodborne transmission of infection, earlier in the year (see ProMED-mail post: Hepatitis A, B & C - Kuwait 20120828.1268627), a larger outbreak of 245 cases of hepatitis A virus infection was reported to involve both the resident and non-resident population, with no suggestion of foodborne transmission.

Further information concerning the hepatitis A situation in Kuwait would be welcome.
