Mexico: West Nile virus infection surveillance data
-----------------------------------------------
[The following updated figures have been extracted from the Resumen
Epidemiologico file accompanying the pictorial Maps of West Nile Virus
Activity in Mexico.

Cumulative totals - Humans
--------------------------
As of Thu 18 Nov 2004, the cumulative total of human tests carried out in
Mexico remains unchanged, and no additional seropositive individuals have
been detected: i.e. in total, 226 individuals resident in 25 of the 32
states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection; 225 were
seronegative and asymptomatic, and one individual in the state of Sonora
exhibited signs of disease [see: West Nile virus - Mexico (Sonora)
20040905.2486].
Cumulative totals - Equines
--------------------------
As of Thu 18 Nov 2004, a total of 3118 horses from all 32 states had been
tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these animals, 2286
were seronegative and 832 (26.7 percent) were seropositive. All the
seropositive animals were asymptomatic. These figures represent an
additional 53 animals tested since Thu 28 Oct 2004, 14 of which were
seronegative and 39 seropositive.
Cumulative totals - Birds
--------------------------
As of Thu 18 Nov 2004, the number of birds tested remains unchanged at 4940
(given wrongly as 44940 previously) since the previous update on Thu 4 Nov
2004. These birds were collected from 8 of the 32 states and have been
tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds, 4750 were
seronegative and 188 were seropositive (and considered to be asymptomatic),
and one case in the state of Sonora, and one case in the state of Baja
California, exhibited signs of disease. (Initially, both birds appear to
have been assigned to the state of Sonora). The seropositive birds were
detected in the states of Baja California, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Queretaro,
Sonora, and Yucatan.
[Sonora state, where the single human case, and one of the 2 avian cases,
were confirmed, shares its northern border with the state of Arizona in the
USA. - Mod.CP]

[With the onset of colder weather, it is clear that regular reporting of
West Nile virus data in Canada and the USA has ceased. Consequently,
ProMED-mail will no longer post updates covering the Western Hemisphere in
2004 and will revert to posting individual reports as they appear. - Mod.CP]
