More than 100 000 people infected with sleeping sickness in Angola
------------------------------------
Sleeping sickness affects 100 000 people in Angola, the director of the
country's Institute for the Eradication of Trypanosomiasis, Teofilo
Josenando, revealed. According to him, 800 000 people are infected yearly
out of the 4 million at risk in 6000 villages north of the River Kuanza.
Josenando told PANA in Luanda that the country's long civil war was to
blame for the alarming spread of the disease, whose prevalence shot up from
0.06 percent [of the population] 10 years ago to 10 percent now.
Tsetse flies (_Glossina_) exist in 14 of Angola's 18 provinces; sleeping
sickness is a health problem in Bengo, Kuanza-Norte, Kwanza-Sul, Malanje,
Uije, Zaire, and Luanda provinces. Some 27 000 cases of sleeping sickness,
including 4000 in Luanda, the capital, have been reported since fighting
resumed in 1992, Josenando said, adding that his institute needs at least
US $5 million per year to combat the disease. The funds are required to
finance the operations of 22 mobile and 43 fixed teams and to buy the
required products.
According to Josenando, trypanosomiasis will be eradicated only if there is
simultaneous treatment of the disease in Angola, the Democratic Republic of
Congo, and Sudan, where it is widespread. Although sleeping sickness has
been present in Angola since the 9th century, it was only in 1949 that
mobile treatment teams started visiting the affected regions. Since that
era, the situation improved considerably, and the number of cases was
reduced from 5000 to only 3 in 1974. However, the outbreak of civil war
after the country's independence in November 1975 severely hampered the
Institute's activities. Its infrastructure was destroyed or plundered,
while most experts fled abroad. At the end of the civil war in April 2002,
the institute decided to extend its operations to all the affected
provinces in the country, Josenando said.
