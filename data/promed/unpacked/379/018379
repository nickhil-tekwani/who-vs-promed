SORGHUM ERGOT SPREADING - AMERICAS

97/119 Further spread of Claviceps africana in the Americas

The ergot disease of sorghum was initially restricted to Asia and Africa
but recently spread to other continents: the Americas and Oceania
(Australia) (see EPPO RS 97/031, 97/073). In the Americas, _Claviceps
africana_ was first found in Brazil in mid-1995, by 1996 it was also found
in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Venezuela*. By mid-February 1997, the
disease [had] spread to Honduras*, Dominican Republic*, Jamaica*, Puerto
Rico* and Mexico*. In March 1997, _C. africana_ was found for the first
time in Texas, USA*.
The fungus was found on cultivated sorghum and also on _Sorghum halepense_.
Cultivated and wild sorghum species are susceptible to _C. africana_ and it
is likely that other grass plants can be hosts. Under epidemic conditions,
near Tampico (Mexico), low infections were observed on pearl millet
(_Pennisetum glaucum_), but the development of the pathogen appeared
limited. Means of entry of _C. africana_ into the Americas is unknown, but
the pathogen has the potential for dissemination by sorghum seed
contaminated with sclerotia or encrusted by dried honeydew that contain
viable macroconida.
