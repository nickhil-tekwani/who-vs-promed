The Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare (MSPyBS) issued a statement and reported on the follow-up of cases of brucellosis, detected after the outbreak in the Faculty of Veterinary Sciences of the National University of Asunción (FCV-UNA). There are 15 patients who are in treatment and follow-up, with antimicrobials for a period of 6 weeks and who will have serological follow-up for 2 years; laboratory analysis every 3 months, once the 6-week treatment is completed.

In addition, next [Tue 21 Nov 2017], a sample collection will again be carried out, as part of the 2nd control, to people who were exposed to the goats and whose 1st test was negative. "They are people exposed to goats between May and October 2017. 5 gave positive, another 9 indeterminate, and the rest negative. For those who were negative and are still within the incubation period, the sample is repeated. The negatives will be retested next month, until the incubation period is completed and all results are negative, when the person can be told that they do not have brucellosis, which is a bacterial infection," said Dr Águeda Cabello, general director of health surveillance.

Finally, Dr Cabello said that positive results of laboratory culture of _Brucella melitensis_ in humans and animals have already been received, confirming that the patients acquired the disease from goats in the university setting.

[It remains unclear how many of the diagnosed and suspected cases of brucellosis had symptoms consistent with clinical brucellosis and how many were asymptomatic but had positive brucella serology in this outbreak of _B. melitensis_ infection.

The symptoms and signs of brucellosis may develop from days to months after the initial exposure to the organism. While some individuals may develop mild symptoms, others may go on to develop long-term chronic symptoms. The signs and symptoms of brucellosis are extensive and they can be similar to many other febrile illnesses, so recognition of potential exposure -- from ingestion of unpasteurized milk or cheese, employment as a veterinarian or veterinary student, in a slaughter house or meat processing plant, or working in a microbiology lab -- is vital.

The City of Asunción, Ciudad de Asunción (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asunción), is an autonomous capital district, not a part of any department. The metropolitan area, called Gran Asunción, includes the cities of San Lorenzo, Fernando de la Mora, Lambaré, Luque, Mariano Roque Alonso, Ñemby, San Antonio, Limpio, Capiatá, and Villa Elisa, which are part of the Central Department. The Asunción metropolitan area has around 2 million inhabitants. - Mod.LL]
