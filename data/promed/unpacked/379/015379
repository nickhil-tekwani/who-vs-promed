Kansas Wheat has identified another significant threat to the 2017 crop -- wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). Alerting growers, [they] said the disease is "crippling western Kansas wheat crop." Kansas State University said 6 counties are indicating widespread incidence of WSMV and related viruses -- High Plains mosaic and triticum mosaic.

"Many fields in this area are severely diseased and could experience more than 70 per cent yield loss, if not a complete loss," the Wheat Commission said. "The rest of western Kansas is dealing with high distributions of these diseases while the central region is also seeing high and moderate infection levels."

US Department of Agriculture said damage may not yet be fully reflected. "Due to the widespread severity, it is difficult to take it all in account because there isn't a year to compare it to. It seems to be getting worse by the day and we anticipate the weekly reports to reflect that. Also, fields can be affected even if it isn't showing symptoms until combines get in."

[_Wheat streak mosaic virus_ (WSMV; genus _Tritimovirus_) can infect wheat, maize (some cultivars), grasses, as well as oats and barley in experimental inoculations. Heavy WSMV infection can cause complete crop failure in wheat. Symptoms usually appear in warmer weather and may include yellow blotches, streaks and mottling on leaves, as well as severe stunting, excessive tillering and possibly death of plants. WSMV has also been reported as synergistic partner, in the Americas and Europe, to cause maize lethal necrosis (MLN) in co-infection with _Maize chlorotic mottle virus_ (MCMV, genus _Machlomovirus_, transmitted by chrysomelid beetles).

WSMV is spread by the wheat curl mite _Aceria tosichella_. Larvae acquire the virus by feeding on infected plants and remain infectious for approximately a week. Field distribution of symptoms is closely related to the dispersal of the vector; for example, margins of fields are often affected first. The virus is not transmitted congenitally to the progeny of the vector. WSMV can also be mechanically transmitted and seed transmitted at a low level. Control of the mite vector is difficult but disease management may include controlling volunteer wheat and grassy weeds to minimise inoculum from the previous season via a 'green bridge'.

_Triticum mosaic virus_ (TriMV; genus _Poacevirus_) was discovered in 2006 in the USA in WSMV resistant cultivars. Further research on its host range and epidemiology is needed. High plains disease is caused by _High Plains wheat mosaic virus_ (HPWMV; genus _Emaravirus_) and can affect wheat, maize and related grasses. For both viruses, symptoms on wheat are similar to WSMV.

All 3 viruses share the wheat curl mite vector and may occur singly or in mixed infections. Disease management may include control of vector and virus reservoirs, but relies mainly on use of cultivars with increased levels of resistance. However, development of crop varieties with stable resistance to multiple viruses is particularly difficult since each pathogen can be expected to mutate independently resulting in a range of changing combinations of strains.

An outbreak of _Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus_ (SBWMV; genus _Furovirus_) is currently also being reported from elsewhere in the US (see link below). This virus is transmitted by the soil-inhabiting fungus _Polymyxa graminis_ and causes one of the few diseases of winter wheat that can destroy an entire crop of a susceptible cultivar (for more information see previous ProMED-mail posts in the archives).
