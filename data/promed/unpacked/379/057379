The [Gujarat] State Health Department has put 42 people, who had come
in contact with a deceased Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
patient, under fever surveillance. The state animal husbandry
department has also begun animal surveillance as part of its
preventive measures to stop the virus from spreading among humans. The
victim was a resident of Uandani village in Vadnagar taluka of Mehsana
district.

Dr Sudhir Gandhi, additional director training and epidemic
[surveillance] in the State Health Department, said there was a
suspicion that the victim [a woman] was infected by CCHF [virus]. "By
the time her samples were sent to National Institute of Virology (NIV)
for CCHF testing, preventive measures had already begun in Uandani and
other neighboring villages," said Gandhi.

He said that all areas falling within 5 kilometre [3.1 mi] radius of
the patient's village are being covered." So far no suspect cases have
been found. 42 people who had come in contact with the deceased
patient are under fever surveillance," he said. He further said that
24 human serum samples have been taken to be checked for symptoms and
they have been sent to NIV for further testing.

"Apart from this our team has collected 56 tick samples from the
cattle in the village. The Animal Husbandry Department has also taken
samples from 16 other cattle. These samples have been sent to NIV and
to the High Security Animal Disease Lab (HSADL)," he said

Fever surveillance will continue throughout next week and if
suspected cases are found it could extend up to a month. The
35-year-old victim was admitted to Sterling Hospital on 20 May 2011
with high fever and the patient died on 21 May 2011. On 24 May 2011
the case was confirmed positive for CCHF [virus infection].

Dr Chandramauli Raval from the hospital said, "Sterling hospital is
equipped to deal with highly infectious cases like that of CCHF. We
treated the case in an isolated ward with staff using personal
protective gear and special instruments. We have sterilised the wards
after the case was confirmed as CCHF. So far no other cases of the
disease have been reported," said Raval.

[The source of the infection is not stated, but may have been a
consequence of contact with cattle carrying CCHF virus infected
_Hyalomma_ ticks. Infected cattle do not generally show symptoms of
CCHF virus infection. Humans who become infected with CCHF acquire the
virus from direct contact with blood or other infected tissues from
livestock, or they may become infected directly from a tick bite. The
majority of cases have occurred in those involved with the livestock
industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers, and
veterinarians.

Prudently a large number of the patient's contacts are under
surveillance and the hospital authorities are aware of the high risk
of nosocomial infection during treatment of CCHF patients.

The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30 percent, with death
occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In those patients who recover,
improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset of
illness. When patients with CCHF are admitted to hospital, there is a
risk of nosocomial spread of infection. In the past, serious outbreaks
have occurred in this way, and it is imperative that adequate
infection control measures be observed to prevent this disastrous
outcome. Patients with suspected or confirmed CCHF should be isolated
and cared for using barrier nursing techniques. For further
