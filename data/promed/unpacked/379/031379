The peste des petits ruminants (PPR) killed 28 head of livestock and wild goats in the past month [September-October 2022] in the animal habitats of Nowshahr and Chalus cities, according to the head of the Department of Wildlife Affairs of the General Department of Environmental Protection of Mazandaran.

In an interview with IRNA reporter, Koros Rabiei added the 1st identified carcass of this type of wildlife was found on 30 Sep 2022 in the high nature area known as the "Black Makliz" valley of Chalus. According to him, at the present time, animals of Nowshahr city, known as "Golestank," the summer and mountainous part of Kajur, are also infected with this virus, and today [10 Oct 2022] the environmentalists found another carcass in the Black Valley of Makliz Chalus.

The outbreak of PPR was reported for the 1st time on 17 Oct of last year [2021] when a number of carcasses of goats and wild goats were observed in the prohibited hunting area of Taleghan in Alborz province, which borders Mazandaran [province], and at that time the environmental officials of Mazandaran confirmed the introduction of this disease. They confirmed it in the province and announced that they found the carcasses of 7 goats and wild goats in the "Delir" forest area of Chalus city.

He estimated a death toll of 250 of these wildlife species last year [2021] in animal habitats such as "Delir", "Nater" in Marzan Abad section of Chalus, Tonkabon, Varusht, Shukh Dere, Harijan and Siah Maklis of Chalus.

The head of the Wildlife Affairs Monitoring Department of the General Department of Environmental Protection of Mazandaran, pointed out that the plague virus has spread to many provinces, including Alborz, Tehran, Qazvin [Caspian Sea] and Tehran, in the past 8 years, and has been confirmed by officials and experts. He said: "Last year [2021], this virus entered Mazandaran province due to the border of the prohibited hunting area of Taleghan city of Alborz province with Chalus and the movement of these species."

Rabiei added that in order to contain and prevent the spread of this virus to other animal habitat in West Mazandaran, a meeting was held during September 2022 with the officials of the general departments of Mazandaran Veterinary Network, Natural Resources and Watershed Management of West Mazandaran and Environmental Protection, and it was decided to plan the Veterinary Network. A comprehensive PPR vaccination was carried out, while the natural resources were asked to remove the few remaining livestock from pastures, or in other words, common pastures between livestock and wildlife, and away from water sources.

He added that in addition, measures were taken to strengthen the protection forces in order to observe and monitor the contaminated centers and identify the carcasses and, starting tomorrow [11 Oct 2022], a number of environmentalists from the center or other parts of Mazandaran are going to take possession of the necessary facilities and equipment. They need to go to the cities affected by this virus so that they can disinfect common drinking fountains between livestock and wildlife.

The head of the Wildlife Affairs Monitoring Department of the General Department of Environmental Protection of Mazandaran considered the movement of mountaineers, tourists and nature lovers in infected areas as the cause of the spread of the plague virus and emphasized that governors, district heads, tourism officials and Islamic councils of rural areas should address this issue and take it seriously and monitor and control the coming and going of this segment of society in these polluted places because their movement causes the contamination of their clothes and they can spread pathogens.

PPR, also known as "goat plague," is an acute, highly contagious, fatal disease that affects small ruminants and camels. The symptoms of this disease are fever, eye and nose discharge, swelling of the mouth, diarrhea, and pneumonia with difficulty breathing, which sometimes leads to death.

Nearby Chalus city, there are 30 000 hectares of central Alborz protected area along with 2 protected rivers -- Sardabroud with a length of 66 km (~41 mi) and Chalus with a length of 78 km (~48 mi) -- which is the habitat of maral, leopard, bear, shoka, pheasant and goat, and unique plant species.

Nowshahr city with about 220 000 hectares of central Alborz protected area and wildlife species such as maral, shoka, goat, brown bear, leopard, pheasant, sea partridge and common partridge is located in the west of Mazandaran.

[Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) was first noticed in Ivory Coast in West Africa during World War II. It is a highly contagious disease of both domestic and wild ruminants, and camels. In 2019 in Iran, PPR was suspected in an episode of deaths of marals (_Cervus elaphus maral_) (see ProMED post 20190527.6489281). PPR is caused by a _Morbillivirus_ (Paramyxoviridae) (like canine distemper virus, measles virus, and rinderpest virus). - Mod.PMB
