[1] China (Wuhan): seafood market or not?

The coronavirus that causes COVID-19 may not have originated from a wet market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the original epicenter of the pandemic, according to a study.

COVID-19 first came to public attention in late December 2019 when people linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, Hubei province, started falling ill with pneumonia after catching a then-unknown virus. Since then, the coronavirus has spread almost worldwide, killing 360 860 people in over 5.8 million cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 2.4 million people are known to have recovered from COVID-19, for which there is currently no specific treatment.

The Chinese scientists who published their findings in Nature [see reference below] are the latest to suggest the virus may have emerged elsewhere. They suggest it could have jumped from an animal to a human in late November 2019, and the busy seafood market may have helped it spread. Citing past research, the authors said a "significant" number of the 1st reported cases didn't have contact with the market.

To reach this conclusion, Fudan University virologist Xiaonan Zhang and colleagues looked at data on how COVID-19 affected 326 patients in Shanghai on China's east coast between [20 Jan and 25 Feb 2020]. From the spit and inner nose swabs taken from these patients, they pinpointed 94 genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19) that were of a high enough quality to analyze, and compared them with others from a worldwide database. This enabled them to assemble what is essentially an evolutionary family tree of the virus. In what is known as phylogenetic analysis, scientists can use such information to do a range of things, including mapping where outbreaks started.

The team wrote: "2 major lineages of the virus derived from one common ancestor may have originated independently from Wuhan in December 2019 and contributed to the current pandemic." One of these spawned at the market, "where high density of stalls, vendors, and customers might have facilitated human-to-human transmission," they wrote. 6 cases in the 1st lineage had contact history with the market, but 3 cases in the 2nd lineage diagnosed at the same period didn't. This is consistent with a study on the earliest cases in Wuhan before [18 Dec 2020], where 5 out of 7 patients were not linked to the market, the researchers said.

Experts who did not work on the study who spoke to Newsweek had differing views on whether the virus came from the market.

Jeremy Rossman, honorary senior lecturer in virology at the UK's University of Kent, told Newsweek evidence suggests that the virus jumped from the human population in November 2019 and "the market was simply the 1st site of extensive human-to-human transmission."

In a paper published by Chinese researchers in The Lancet journal in January 2020 [see reference below] on the 1st 41 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the earliest case fell ill on [1 Dec 2019]. The person had no known link to the market, as was also the case for 13 others featured in the study. Rossman said: "Other groups have identified 2 early lineages of the virus, but this is the 1st suggestion that this split occurred before the infection at the market.

"Together, this paper and the existing data offer a convincing view that SARS-CoV-2 did not first emerge at the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan in December 2019, but earlier in November [2020], in some as yet unidentified location in the general area of Wuhan."

Addressing past allegations by President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the virus escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Ian Jones, professor of virology at the University of Reading, UK, who did not work on the study, told Newsweek: "That theory has been well and truly trashed by scientific analysis of the virus and should now be buried."

Jones said the Nature study was limited due to the small number of samples the team analyzed. He said: "It remains possible the 1st events did occur in the market but sometime before the main cluster of cases were identified, by which time one (presumably) individual had left the market and begun transmission outside."

Andrew Preston, who researches microbial pathogenesis at the University of Bath, UK, told Newsweek that current evidence suggests the virus originated from the market.

Preston said it is "very difficult to reach a conclusion" that there were 2 types of SARS-CoV-2 introduced into people in Wuhan.

"When analyzing a subset of viruses, sampling can have a large effect. The virus mutates naturally, so mutations will arise all of the time. If one variant happened to find its way into someone who then passed it on to a lot of people, (maybe because they were asymptomatic and didn't isolate, maybe because they happened to contact a lot of people before becoming ill, etc.) then that virus will appear in a lot more people than a virus that was carried by someone who didn't pass it on a lot. So that virus will appear to be more common," he said.

Preston said it's possible the analysis picked up a variant that arose in a person who was exposed to the market, but then passed it on to people who weren't. "If you then sample only from those people who weren't, it will appear that their virus arose outside of the market."

However, Peter Forster, fellow of the McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research at the UK's University of Cambridge, told Newsweek he was not surprised the fish market does not fully qualify as the source of the COVID-19 outbreak, citing The Lancet study. "Unfortunately there is no genomic information for this patient, as far as I know, which limits further investigation on the true origins of the outbreak," he said.

In research yet to be peer-reviewed, Forster and colleagues analyzed 1001 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and found it may have infected people as early as mid-September [2020]. Jones said that is unclear whether the exact location or animal where the virus came from will ever be found.

[Dr Dan Lucey on 27 May 2020 wrote for Sciences Speaks Blog that "The China Center for Disease Control Director, Dr George Fu Gao (Gao Fu) was quoted in the South China Morning Post 23 May 2020, saying: "We first believed the virus originated in the seafood market, but now it looks like that the market is just another victim. The virus existed [before the infections happened in the market]," Gao said (see https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/05/27/china-cdc-director-on-covid-19-the-market-is-just-another-victim-the-virus-existed-before-the-infections-happened-in-the-market/).

That being said, no information was provided to permit an assessment of this conclusion. Given the date of onset of the 1st confirmed case of 1 Dec 2019, and that particular case did not have a connection with the seafood market, transmission to this individual occurred some time in the preceding 14 days (in the 2nd half of November 2019), and it is possible that an earlier, possibly asymptomatically infected individual who did have contact with the market in November 2019 may have transmitted the virus outside of the market and will never show up in a contact lineage tracing/investigation. According to reports out of Wuhan, apparently the animals that were sampled in the market were sampled in early January 2020. The absence of identifying the virus in animals after the 1st week in January 2020 may not have reflected the animals that were in the market in late November 2019 or early December 2019, when these spillovers most likely have occurred. Remember the curious report of a case in France in December 2019, a similar type of event may have occurred with an asymptomatic or mildly ill individual shedding virus after travelling from Wuhan to France (see COVID-19 update (160): global, France Dec 2019 case, tocilizumab, WHO, RFI 20200506.7304287) -- note the virus hasn't been isolated or sequenced as yet.

So, did it start in the seafood market? I think the jury is still out on this conclusion. Thanks to Dr Dan Lucey for flagging this percolating discussion. - Mod.MPP

[2] New Zealand: meat packing plants
Date: Tue 2 Jun 2020
From: Fiona Thomson-Carter <Fiona.Thomson-Carter@mpi.govt.nz> [edited]


[re: ProMED COVID-19 update (213): global, meat packing, Netherlands, Brazil, WHO 20200527.7381561]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In response to the moderator's comment item [3] Meat packing plants, in New Zealand we have been able to minimise transmission of COVID-19 in meat processing and packing premises through the following hierarchy of safety measures, and believe such measures are feasible and effective in meat packing environments:
- Hierarchy of pre-entry health screening and contact declarations;
- 2 metre [6.5 ft] social distancing in situations where workers mingle with standard personal hygiene (hand wash/dry with alcohol gel);
- formation of workplace bubbles/teams;
- recommendation of PPE (gloves and facemasks) for work situations requiring 1-2 metre [3.3-6.5 ft] distancing;
- required additional adequate physical screens or visors/facemasks for work at less than 1 metre [3.3 ft].

The burden of COVID-19 in the community in New Zealand, if any, is clearly lower than other countries. However, implementation of a hierarchy of controls to date has been effective in minimising transmission of the virus in these premises.

[The moderator comment referred to from COVID-19 update (213): global, meat packing, Netherlands, Brazil, WHO 20200527.7381561 was: "Meat packing plants have been hit fairly hard in a number of countries as the "assembly lines" are such that do not permit social distancing and the wearing of masks is difficult for the duration of a shift. Workers have been considered as essential workers but if they stay home they aren't paid. ProMED has posted on the USA situation with plants affected in 18 different states (COVID-19 update (204): global, meat plant outbreaks, WHO 20200523.7370321)."

ProMED (and the moderator who wrote that comment) would like to thank Dr Fiona Thomson-Carter for sharing the New Zealand experience with us. New Zealand is one of the few countries that has been able to possibly interrupt transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, after 1504 reported cases -- with the last known case reported on 23 May 2020 (according to our files of Worldometer data). I use the word possibly as 1st, it has not been 2 incubation periods since the last reported case, and 2nd the "surprise package" of silent asymptomatic transmission is unfortunately still a possibility. That being said, New Zealand did an excellent job of isolation/quarantine with intense contact tracing and testing. The low level transmission that was ongoing may have helped limit spread to meat packing plants, but the bullet point about the use of face shields for work stations of 1 meter [3.3 ft] or less may well have made a difference. The face shields for longer use may be more comfortable to use than the face masks. - Mod.MPP

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

In the 24 hours since the last WHO update:
------------------------------------------
The Americas region reported 59.7% of the global newly reported cases and 70.3% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Of the newly confirmed cases in the region, 45.3% were reported by Brazil, 24.5% by the USA, Peru 10.1%, Chile 6.6%, and Mexico 3.9%. Brazil reported almost twice as many cases as the USA in the past 24 hours.

The European region reported 14.0% of the global newly reported cases and 12.7% of newly reported fatalities for this 24-hour period. Russia reported 52.4% of the newly confirmed cases in the region, followed by the UK 11.2%, Belarus 5.2%, Turkey 4.9%, and Sweden 2.5%.

The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 12.3% of the global newly reported cases and 6.9% of global newly reported fatalities. Pakistan reported 19.6% of the regional newly reported cases, followed by Iran 16.6%, Saudi Arabia 12.4%, Qatar 10.9%, Egypt 10.1%, and Oman 6.7%.

The African region reported 3.0% of the global newly reported cases and 2.1% of newly reported fatalities. South Africa reported 47.2% of the newly reported cases in the region in the past 24 hours, followed by Nigeria at 8.5%, Cameroon at 6.7%, Central African Republic 3.8%, Mayotte and Algeria 3.5%, Ghana at 3.1%, and Senegal and Ethiopia at 3.0%.

The Western Pacific region reported 1.2% of the global newly reported cases and 0.2% of global fatalities. The Philippines reported 56.2% of the newly reported cases in the region, followed by Singapore at 33.8%, Malaysia 3.7%, South Korea at 2.3%, and Japan at 2.2%.

The South East Asia region reported 9.7% of the global newly reported cases and 7.8% of global fatalities. India reported 70.3% of newly reported cases in the region, followed by Bangladesh 21.3%, Indonesia 5.9%, and Nepal 1.4%.

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases, by date of report and WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 1 Jun 2020, at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic starting in the Western Pacific, transitioning to multiregional activity as the virus travelled. Europe has significantly decreased. The Americas continues to increase, as does South East Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean who are both approaching a parity with the European region in terms of daily newly confirmed cases. The Americas greatly outnumbers all other regions for daily reporting. - Mod.MPP]
