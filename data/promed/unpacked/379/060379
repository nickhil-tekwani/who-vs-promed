Taiwan records 1st foot-and-mouth case of the year in Penghu
------------------------------------------------------------
A total of 6 pigs transported to Penghu from Taiwan's main island
were found to have foot-and-mouth disease [FMD], the Council of
Agriculture announced Saturday [13 Feb 2010]. The animals would be
killed and the relevant farm disinfected and put under special watch
while all necessary tests were conducted, the COA said.

The animal health authorities in Penghu notified the COA on Friday,
officials said. Inspectors were reportedly conducting tests on the
farm which supplied the pigs, though the COA did not reveal where in
Taiwan it was located. The FMD found was of the O-type and did not
pose any threat to humans, officials said.

The COA said farmers should use vaccination to protect their animals
against the disease and conduct careful checks of visiting
individuals and vehicles. Farmers who don't inform the animal health
services of problems with pigs' mouths, noses or feet could face
fines of up to NTD 50 000 [USD 1558], the authorities said.
