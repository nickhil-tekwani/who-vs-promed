The number of people affected by [a] hantavirus [infection] in Los Santos province has increased to 71. Of these, 38 are febrile cases, 8 have mild hantavirus pulmonary syndrome [HPS], and 24 have severe pulmonary syndrome, as announced by regional health authorities.

The latest case presented this past Mon 22 Dec [2014], when a 62 year old man from the Tonosi district was admitted into the intensive care unit of the Gustavo Nelson Collado Hospital in Chitre, a victim of hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome. According to [hospital] information, he is in dialysis.

While cases continue to be reported, the Ministry of Health reminds the residents of [affected] localities that it is very important to avoid contact with rodents and maintain cleanliness in and around their houses.

[Cases of hantavirus infection and HPS continue to slowly mount in Los Santos province. The report above does not indicate how many of these cases have been fatal this year (2014).

Although not specified in the report above or the previous ones, the hantavirus most likely involved is Choclo virus, since it is the only hantavirus known to cause HPS with hospitalizations in Panama. The Azuero region, including Los Santos province, is endemic for Choclo virus, and several cases this year (2014) and in the past have come from there. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings, which is why the Ministry of Health issues precautionary advice about avoiding contact with these rodents and their excreta.
