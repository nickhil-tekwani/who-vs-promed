WHO: China Denies Reports of Human Cases of H5N1 Influenza Infection
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Chinese health authorities have denied Internet reports that there have been
human infections and deaths caused by the H5N1 influenza virus in their
country, the head of the World Health Organization's influenza branch said
on Wed 25 May 2005.

Dr. Klaus Stohr said the WHO conferred with representatives of the Chinese
Ministry of Health both in Geneva and in Beijing and was given assurances
the reports, published on some Chinese websites, were unfounded. "We have
spoken with the Ministry of Health representatives here in Geneva today. We
have also had contact with our colleagues in China. They have come back and
said that there is no indication of human cases. They have not seen any
human cases," Stohr said in an interview from Geneva. The WHO will continue
to monitor the situation, Stohr added.

A report circulated by ProMED-mail -- a mailing list operated by the
International Society for Infectious Diseases -- said at least 6 [Chinese]
tourists to Qinghai province died after being infected with H5N1 influenza
virus. The discovery that 178 migratory geese carrying the virus had died
in a nature reserve in Qinghai Province has had Chinese authorities
scrambling to ensure the deadly H5N1 virus doesn't get a toe hold in their
country. Their response includes mass vaccination of two million chickens in
the area. [Chinaâ€™s report to the OIE of 21 May 2005 stated that 519
migratory waterfowl of 5 species had been found dead from avian flu, see
ProMED post: Avian influenza, geese - China (02) 20050523.1423. - Mod.JW]

Stohr said Chinese authorities responded in writing and in detail to WHO's
queries, explaining the vaccination program and precautions being taken by
workers involved in it. As well, authorities are on the lookout for cases of
severe respiratory disease among workers or people who visited the nature
reserve, he said.

Influenza authorities fear the H5N1 avian influenza virus, which has become
endemic in bird stocks in some parts of Southeast Asia, may acquire the
ability to transmit easily to and among humans, sparking a flu pandemic.
