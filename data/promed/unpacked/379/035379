On 8 Jun, Dr J. M. Arnoldi, Deputy Administrator, Veterinary Services,
United States Department of Agriculture, Washington, DC, reported to the
OIE an outbreak of Newcastle disease virus in cormorants kept at a
non-commercial facility in Fresno, California.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory. Date of initial
detection of animal health incident: 7 June 1998. Estimated date of first
infection: 23 May 1998.
Location: Fresno County, State of California
No. of outbreaks: 1
Description of affected population: the outbreak site had 48 game chickens
including two game breeds (Shamos and Aceels). These birds were located at
a single site which has game chickens only and no commercial poultry.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: National Veterinary Services
Laboratory, Ames, Iowa.
B. Diagnostic tests used: virus isolation and haemagglutination-inhibition
test.
C. Causal agent: velogenic viscerotropic paramyxovirus type 1. The isolate
was inoculated into eight chickens 4 to 6 weeks old. Six birds died and all
had pathology characteristic of velogenic viscerotropic Newcastle disease
virus.
Epidemiology: an extensive epidemiological investigation has been completed
and at this point there is no evidence of live bird movements from the
outbreak premises during the incubation of the disease and there is no
evidence that the virus has spread from the initial outbreak site.
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: a review of bird, people and
fomite movement is under way. Bird movement does not appear to be likely as
the source for this outbreak. The current hypothesis is that the source of
the virus was movement of people or fomites.
B. Other epidemiological details: the nearest commercial poultry operation
is 17 miles from the outbreak site.
Surveillance measures taken to date:
1. Intensive surveillance was conducted in an area around the initial
premises. In this area, there are four blocks of residential premises and
the rest is industrial (no birds). A hundred and fifty-eight visits were
made in the four residential blocks. Eighteen premises had birds, 77
premises did not have birds and in the remaining 63 premises there was
nobody at home during the initial call (they will be visited again).
Currently, we estimate the number of birds in the intensive surveillance
area to be approximately 75. The intensive surveillance area is
characterised by having no free-roaming birds or poultry. All birds and
poultry are contained in sturdy fences that include covers over the tops of
pens. The intensive surveillance area is under a hold order for the
transport of birds. Poultry in this area will be purchased for diagnostic
purposes.
2. State surveillance
State surveillance has been intensified. The current plan for surveillance
is to increase the laboratory submissions from all premises within the
State of California. The commercial poultry industry, including egg
producers, broiler producers, turkey producers and other poultry
industries, has been notified through the California Poultry Industry
Federation hotline and by direct phone contact with industry leaders. To
reach small avian operations (commercial and hobby), a State surveillance
system has been established for the specific purpose of encouraging
laboratory submissions. Submissions are encouraged by not charging owners
with fewer than 2,000 birds any fees for the service.
The surveillance plan also includes contacting local feed stores, live bird
markets, auction yards and flea markets looking for any evidence of
disease, as well as for educational purposes. We are distributing
literature and information to these contacts about increasing biosecurity.
Observation of live bird markets and auction yards so far in the Fresno
district have not resulted in any further evidence of the disease being
detected.
Control measures taken to date: stamping-out policy. The disease is
notifiable and importation is prohibited from infected countries.
