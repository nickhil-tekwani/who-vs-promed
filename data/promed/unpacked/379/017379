The Junta [Board] of Andalusia has detected 4 outbreaks of bluetongue disease, in 4 farms in the Campo de Gibraltar county. The affected holdings are located in the Tarifa (3) and Castellar (1) municipalities. All cases were caused by bluetongue virus (BTV) serotype 4. The Ministry of Agriculture took samples after observing symptoms compatible with this disease in a sheep farm located in Castellar de la Frontera. The confirmed outbreak was published in the Veterinary Health Alert Network (RASVE) of the Ministry of Agriculture on 15 Oct 2013. On 18 Oct 2013, the 3 outbreaks from Tarifa were similarly published.

It had been 6 months since this animal disease, not communicable to humans, had been detected previously, namely in March 2013 in the Campo de Gibraltar. Given the finding of virus circulation, veterinary authorities have reinforced existing prevention measures, monitoring and control in the area, in order to obtain more information on the epidemiological situation of the disease and control the possible spread of the virus, according to the Ministry of Environment. Whereas at present vaccination against bluetongue is voluntary, in order to prevent the spread of the virus and the consequent economic losses from the clinical involvement of animals and trade restrictions, the Ministry recommended vaccination of susceptible animals in the affected areas and neighboring areas. At the same time, an official notification of new outbreaks has been made to the European Commission, other regions and sectors. Anyway, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Board noted that there are not, for the moment, restrictions on the movement of livestock except from the 4 farms concerned in order to avoid transmission of the disease which, they insisted, had no effect on human health and is spread through mosquitoes to the flocks of sheep.

[According to Morocco's reports to the OIE, BTV serotypes 1 and 4 have been circulating there for several years, including the 1st half of 2013. It should thus not surprise that the adjacent Spanish territory, Campo de Gibraltar, is similarly affected by the same serotype(s) of this Culicoides-borne orbivirus. In the EU map of bluetongue "restricted zones", last updated 4 Oct 2013, Spain's southernmost part in Andalusia is colored dark blue (zone I; serotypes 1, 4); see map at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bt_restrictedzones-map_2012.jpg. The map conveniently shows the current restriction zones in other European countries, namely Italy (particularly Sardinia, Sicily and Tuscany), Corsica (France), Cyprus and some Greek islands adjacent to Turkey's coast.

Between 2008 and 2010, BTV-8 was also reported in Campo de Gibraltar. Spain reported the absence of this serotype since September 2010 in the presentation to EU's SCFCAH dated 15 Jan 2013. The document is available at http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations/15012013_bluetongue_spain.pdf.

Traditionally, bluetongue is a serious clinical disease in sheep, particularly European breeds. The phenomenon observed during recent years, in Europe, of clinical disease in cattle is rather unusual; cattle (and goats) have been known to be subclinical sentinels for the virus. - Mod.AS
