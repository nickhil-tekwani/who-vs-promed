Northern Ireland farmers breathed a sigh of relief last night after
preliminary tests on a sheep with suspected foot-and-mouth symptoms in
County Tyrone proved negative. But Agriculture Minister Brid Rodgers urged
the farming community to remain on full alert, warning it is not out of the
woods yet.
Last night the minister's counterpart in the Republic, Joe Walsh, imposed a
ban on French imports after a case of foot-and-mouth was confirmed in a
dairy herd in the Loire Valley.
The 8 km surveillance zone around the Augher farm at the centre of the
scare was lifted last night, but restrictions remain on the abattoir in
Dungannon and the farm itself.
