There is no contraindication to taking a 5 dose course of post
exposure rabies prophylaxis as opposed to a 3 dose regimen if you
believe rabies has been ruled out in the source animal.
It is not clear from the original post whether or not the exposed persons
received rabies immune globulin on day 0. If they did, I do not think
a 3 dose regimen should be considered since it is possible the immune
globulin would blunt the immune response expected from the standard
pre-exposure regimen.
Whether or not rabies in the cow has been ruled out is another
question. With conflicting FA results we generally lean toward the
conservative path of believing the positive results. Since the
suckling mouse test takes 28 days, you won't have another
result to compare before the day 14 dose is due (which is the dose
that would make the difference between a pre-exposure and a
post-exposure regimen at this point, since the day 3 dose has already
been administered), so I believe the full post-exposure regimen
should be given to those who were previously unimmunized, and the 2
dose (days 0 and 3) treatment given to the person who was previously
immunized.
Another consideration with the suckling mouse test is that it may
give a false negative result if the virus titer in the material
tested is low, or if the virus has been inactivated in the
handling/processing process. In our lab we use PCR as a confirmatory
test when the FA is inconclusive.

SUBJECT: what would be your recommendation?

1. If they do not trust the diagnosis, then assume the cow was
positive. If the diagnosis was made based on Negri bodies, I
definitely wouln't trust it.
2. Anyone who had saliva or brain material in contact with a
mucous membrane or fresh open wound should have postexposure treatment.
3. Persons who have had preexposure vaccinations with HDCV (or with
another product and developed a measureable titer) or persons who have
previously had postexposure treatment should receive 1ml boosters IM
on day 0 (first day of treatment) and day 3. Follow up titers are only
necessary if there is reason to believe that that the person may be
immunocompromised.
4. Persons who have never been immunized or who did not develop a
measureable titer after preexposure vaccination with a product other
than HDCV should receive Rabies Immune Globulin on day 0 and 1ml of
vaccine IM on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 28.
5. These are recommendations I would give in this country using either
HDCV or RVA vaccine. One of the problems in developing countries
(besides the question on diagnosis) is whether RIG is available and what
kind of vaccine is available. Recommendations may vary depending on
the availability of RIG and the type of vaccine. WHO or CDC would be
best sources for information on other regimens.

I've been involved in similar situations with rabies. Since this is a
one shot disease and there is a possibility of infection in nerves
with short pathways to the brain, I would definitley recommend the
post-exposure prophylaxis, particularly with the human diploid cell
derived vaccine. It can make people feel pretty sick after the last
one or two shots, I think mainly because of the strength of the immune
reaction. But it is a lot better than rabies! I don't know of any
problems in already vaccinated people particulary several years ago
and the vaccine data sheet does refer to this situation

Immunoflouresence is a good screening test but DOES miss some positive
animals i.e. a negative IFA result doesn't tell you enough to decide
an animal is negative, so I would go for the vaccination. Even if it
isn't necessary this time, you will be protected the next time this
happens.........

The data sheet with the vaccine gives very clear instructions on
post-exposure prophlaxis- five shots if my memory serves me well, but
I can't remember the timing. I would advise you getting hold of a data
sheet if you haven't already.

Some authorities advise that the immunoglobulin should not be used as
it interferes with the immune response to the vaccine.

Good luck.

The answer to the question of post exposure rabies prophylaxis depends in
part on the type of vaccine available to you and the vaccination status of
those exposed. The following comments are based on the assumption that you
have access to HDCV (human diploid cell vaccine) rabies vaccine and to HRIG
(human rabies immune globulin).
Exposure of the type you describe would be considered significant exposure
to rabies. I believe there have been over 30 cases of human rabies in the
world literature attributed to exposure to bovine saliva in agricultural and
veterinary settings. For unimuunized persons (and all veterinary workers
should ideally have been immunized with the 3 dose pre-exposure series) the
recommended coures is five (5) doses of HDCV on days 0,3,7,14 & 28 with
20iu/Kg HRIG at a separate site on day 0 (all shots i.m.).
The HRIG should be used if available regardless of the delay between
exposure and staring the treatment course.
For previously immunized individuals (either pre-exposure immunization or a
previous course of post-exposure prophylatic treatment), the recommended
course of prophylaxix is two (2) dose of HDCV on days 0 & 3. No HRIG is
needed. I would suggest that you don't need to do serology on any of these
individuals as long as you have reliable information that the person
received a vaccine of recognized efficacy. If the history is uncertain, I
would assume the person is unimmunized and give the 5 dose vaccine plus
immune globulin course. The is some risk of a serum sickness type of
post-immunization reaction if the person is in fact already immune but while
this can be unpleasant it is a lesser risk than the risk associated with
rabies.
If this particular cow turns out not to be rabid, it may be worthwhile
considering getting everyone immunized so they are protected for future
exposures - even those that may not be recognized. If cost is a major
limiting factor remember that for pre-exposure immunization (but NOT
post-exposure) a ).1ml dose of HDCV can be used instead of 1.0ml im and thus
you can immunize as many as 8 people from one standard dose.
Hope this info is useful
