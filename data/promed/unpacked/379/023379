Lumpy skin disease [LSD] virus (inf. with), Singapore
----------------------------------
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 9 Mar 2022
Confirmed: 11 Mar 2022
Reported: 12 Mar 2022
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence in the country
Causal agent: lumpy skin disease virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to the whole country.

Outbreak location 1: North
Started: 9 Mar 2022
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 58 / 13 / 0 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: Raised skin nodules measuring roughly 2-5 cm [0.8-2 in] in diameter were observed in various body regions of affected cattle (e.g., neck, flank); 9 nasal swabs from 11 milking cows (9 of which presented with severe disseminated skin nodules and remaining 2 were clinically normal) and 2 direct swabs of ulcerated skin nodules from a bull were taken. All affected and in-contact animals have been isolated on the farm premises. LSDV DNA was detected via real-time and conventional PCR from the samples taken. This was confirmed by sequencing.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive

Epidemiological comments: Inspections and samplings were conducted in response to recent notifications of LSD spread in the region. LSDV DNA was detected via real-time and conventional PCR from samples taken from the cattle. This was confirmed by sequencing. As of 9 Mar 2022, there have been no recent clinical findings affecting the other major populations of susceptible species on other premises. The stakeholders have been informed to enhance surveillance.

Control measures at event level
Control measures applied, domestic: surveillance outside containment and/or the protection zone, surveillance within containment and/or the protection zone, movement control inside the country, control of vectors

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Centre for Animal and Veterinary Sciences (national laboratory)
Species / Test / Outbreaks / Test date / Result
Cattle / polymerase chain reaction (PCR) / 1 / 11 Mar 2022 / positive
Cattle / real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) / 1 / 11 Mar 2022 / positive
Cattle / gene sequencing / 1 / 11 Mar 2022 / positive
