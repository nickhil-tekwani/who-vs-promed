Isolation of Nipah virus from the Island flying fox {_Pteropus hypomelanus_)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
SINGAPORE: Researchers in Malaysia have confirmed a link between fruit bats
and Nipah virus, the recently discovered novel paramyxovirus that killed
more than 100 people last year and compelled authorities to slaughter
roughly a million pigs. Prof. Kenneth Lam Sai Kit, of the Department of
Microbiology at the University of Malaya, confirmed that his research team
had successfully isolated Nipah virus from urine samples collected from
[colonies of the Island flying fox [_Pteropus hypomelaunus_, one of the
many species of fruit bats that live throughout Southeast Asia. Professor
John S. Mackenzie, of the Department of Microbiology and Parasitology at
Australia's University of Queensland stated that this finding confirms that
bats are carriers or reservoirs for the virus, which last year crossed over
to pigs and then to humans. Professor Lam's findings constitute a
breakthrough in understanding [of the biology of the virus.
Professor Lam's finding came just after a [suspected outbreak of Nipah
virus in June in Northern Malaysia. Health authorities in Northern Perak
killed more than 1 700 pigs to prevent the disease from spreading after a
woman living nearby was found to have the virus [It is not known on what
basis this statement is made. We have not received notification of any
recent human cases in which viral isolation has been documented, there has
been detection of viral nucleic acid, or seroconversion has been
demonstrated. -Man. Ed. DS. While it remains unclear exactly how the virus
is transmitted from fruit bats to pigs, numerous opportunities exist for
the rare crossover to occur, Professor Lam said. Fruit trees in which bats
forage for food are often near pigsties, he said, and Malaysia's pig
farmers tend to live very close to their pigs. Malaysia is considering
measures to protect its $400-million-a-year pig farming industry, which was
crippled by last year's outbreak.
Nipah virus infection first appeared as a pandemic early last year when it
hit pig farms in Malaysia and slaughterhouses in nearby Singapore. Health
workers initially believed they were dealing with an outbreak of Japanese
encephalitis, which is transmitted from pigs to humans by mosquitoes. The
symptoms were similar: high fever, aches and coma. Roughly 4 of every 10
sufferers died. Confounding this early diagnosis was the fact that some
victims had been inoculated against Japanese encephalitis and that most
lived near or worked on pig farms. The virus was also killing some pigs,
and Japanese encephalitis virus is not associated with mortality in pigs.
After a Malaysian microbiologist isolated the virus from the brain and
spinal fluid of Nipah victims, scientists at the Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) in Atlanta determined that the virus [given the name Nipah
virus after the village at the epicenter of the 0utbreak was not Japanese
encephalitis virus but a novel virus belonging to the family
_Paramyxoviridae_. Its closest relative [appeared to be another recently
discovered paramyxovirus called Hendra virus, which was isolated in 1994
after killing 14 horses and their trainer in Australia. Hendra virus was
carried by fruit bats, so researchers began searching for a similar link
between Nipah virus and bats. Scientists from the CDC, Taiwan, Japan and
Australia flew to Malaysia, scouring pig farms and villages and trapping
bats. Tissue samples from roughly 300 fruit bats revealed antibodies
against Nipah virus, [but no infectious virus was isolated. A year later,
Professor Lam and his team set out to search themselves. In early June, he
said, they spent 3 nights laying plastic sheets under trees full of flying
foxes, collecting urine samples. Back in the lab, they found isolates of
Nipah virus that matched those recovered from humans. Professor Lam said
that only 3 of his 1,000-odd samples contained the virus, which indicated
that bats were by no means infested by the virus. Professor Mackenzie, who
researched the Hendra virus's transmission from bats to horses and to
humans, said infections took place only under very rare circumstances,
usually by direct contact with infected blood. In Nipah's case, no
transmission between people appears to have occurred. Professor Lam said
that because Nipah can also be found in saliva, it was possible that pigs
may have [become infected by eating fruit that the bats had nibbled on.
How the virus moves from pigs to humans remains unclear, but researchers
believe one possibility is that people [inhale infected particles of
saliva coughed up by Nipah virus-infected pigs. Professor Lam's findings
raise concern about the possibility that the bats, which are migratory,
could carry the disease beyond Malaysia. Southeast Asia is home to several
species of fruit bat, many of which are considered delicacies and have been
hunted nearly to extinction. In Malaysia, for example, fruit bats are now
protected by law. Professor Lam said antibodies against Nipah virus had
been found in other species of fruit bat. Moreover, Nipah is also known to
infect dogs, cats and horses, presenting the possibility that pig farms may
not be the only venues for crossover.

[Molecular analyses have confirmed that Nipah virus and Hendra virus are
closely related, but different viruses. The N, C, P, V, M, F and G genes of
Nipah virus have nucleotide sequence homologies ranging from 88% to 70%,
and predicted amino acid homologies ranging from 92% to 67%, in comparison
with Hendra virus. The intergenic regions and start/stop signals of the 2
viruses are identical. They are substantially different from and have
larger genomes than previously known paramyxoviruses (measles virus, mumps
virus, the parainfluenza viruses, Newcastle disease virus, respiratory
syncytial virus, etc.). Consequently, taxonomically these 2 bat viruses are
likely to constitute a new genus in the family _Paramyxoviridae_. - Mod.CP
