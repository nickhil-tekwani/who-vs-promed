Confirmation of Nipah Virus Infection
-------------------------------------
SEREMBAN: A report received from the Universiti Malaya Medical Centre
confirmed that a 22-year old goat farm worker, who died on 29 Jan 2001, 3
days after admission to the Seremban Hospital, was infected with Nipah
virus. Health Ministry Parliamentary Secretary, S. Sothinathan, said
yesterday that: "This is not a new case of infection as the farm worker had
been infected by the virus while culling pigs in Bukit Pelandok earlier," he
said when asked to comment on the death.
No new [i.e. more recent case of infection involving either Japanese
encephalitis virus or Nipah virus had been reported in the area,
Sothinathan said. "The Health Ministry and other relevant agencies are
monitoring the situation in the Bukit Pelandok area. I hope the people in
the area will not be alarmed as it is now safe."
Sothinathan said also that the worker's employer, who had displayed similar
symptoms and was being treated at a private hospital, was not suffering from
either Japanese encephalitis virus or Nipah virus infection.

[This report provides reliable confirmation of the presumptive diagnosis with
which this thread was concluded in the previous post. Whether virus
infection was the actual cause of death of the farm worker is an open
question since the 2 patients under investigation reportedly displayed
similar symptoms irrespective of their Nipah virus status. - MOD.CP
