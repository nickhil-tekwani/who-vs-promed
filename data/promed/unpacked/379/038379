One of the 2 patients infected with anthrax in East China's Shandong Province has died, according to a weekly report issued by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Tuesday [31 Aug 2021]. The victim, a 14-year-old student, died on 6 Aug 2021. The other patient is a 35-year-old man who is a butcher, according to the report.

The 2 confirmed cases were reported to the Shandong CDC as of 15 Aug 2021, and the authority formed a joint investigation team to determine the sources of the infection to prevent any further spread. Anthrax is a rare but serious infection caused by the bacteria _Bacillus anthracis_, and it is often fatal.

On 28 Jul 2021, the student suddenly experienced fever, fatigue, vomiting, diarrhea and convulsions, and was taken to the health clinic of Liumiao village for treatment. On 31 Jul 2021, the patient was transferred to Binzhou Medical University Hospital due to sudden unconsciousness, lockjaw and nuchal rigidity during infusion in the village clinic. On 6 Aug 2021, the patient was voluntarily discharged from the hospital and died on the same day.

The investigation team found that the 2nd patient slaughtered sick cattle bought from Wendian Township in Yangxin County at the 1st patient's home on 25 Jul 2021.

China recorded several confirmed or suspected cases of anthrax in multiple places in August [2021], including Beijing and North China's Shanxi Province.

Wenshui County in Shanxi reportedly found 9 suspected cases of anthrax among people who were involved in cattle breeding, slaughtering and selling on 15 Aug 2021. Beijing also found an anthrax pneumonia patient on 9 Aug 2021, who came from its neighboring North China's Hebei Province and had a contact history with cattle and sheep [see Anthrax - China: (HB) human, source uncertain, susp 20210809.8581706].

Wang Peiyu, a deputy head of Peking University's School of Public Health, told the Global Times on Tuesday [31 Aug 2021] that although anthrax is not contagious, it is more deadly than COVID-19, especially pulmonary anthrax. He noted that the surge in anthrax cases recently is worth attention, suggesting that health authorities should track down the animals that transmitted the epidemic and burn or bury those animals promptly before _Bacillus anthracis_ gets into the wider environment.

The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs on Thursday [26 Aug 2021] issued a document, warning of the risk of anthrax outbreaks in places that are affected by torrential rains and floods and that lack effective systems of animal epidemic prevention.

The Shandong CDC and related health agencies have implemented a strict 12-day quarantine requirement for all close contacts of the 2 confirmed cases, including 24 who quarantined at home and 9 at centralized isolation facilities. The body temperatures and health status of each close contact were monitored daily. Meanwhile, 78 people have been screened for fever, diarrhea, vomiting and skin symptoms in primary medical institutions, and no new cases had been found as of 24 Aug 2021. Preventive medications were provided to more than 4700 close contacts and key personnel, according to the report.

To better address public concerns related to anthrax, recommendations have been made to raise awareness about the prevention of anthrax, and to further strengthen the training and guidance of medical staff and health workers at primary medical and healthcare services, read the CDC weekly report.

[This is clearly a bigger problem than indicated by these 2 human cases. This happens when anthrax reporting depends on surveillance of human cases and not on animal health reporting by the veterinary services. Anthrax is primarily an animal disease and economically most important when it impacts livestock, in this case cattle in various places. While there are effective human vaccines, the cheapest and most cost-effective control procedure is to vaccinate cattle, and sheep and pigs when they are infected. The Sterne animal vaccine is one of the cheapest and most effective vaccines in the world and provides some 9 months of protection; anthrax immunity is not long lasting, which is why annual livestock vaccination is recommended each year ahead of the summer anthrax season. So make sure your public health officers are talking to their veterinary colleagues.
