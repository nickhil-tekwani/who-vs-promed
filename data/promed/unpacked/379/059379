South Korea reports 1st case of MERS virus; patient stable
- before symptoms, 68 year old male returns from Bahrain
- patient's wife shows minor symptoms; test results on Thu [21 May 2015]
- "no possibility" of spread among general public

South Korean health officials on Wednesday [20 May 2015] confirmed the country's 1st case of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in a patient who recently returned from Bahrain and is in a stable condition after being treated for a high fever and cough.

The 68 year old man was in Bahrain from [18 Apr 2015 through to 3 May 2015] and was engaged in farming-related business, South Korea's health ministry said in a statement. He returned to South Korea on [4 May 2015] through Qatar, it said.

The patient's wife who nursed him also has a minor respiratory symptom and the results of tests on her will be available on Thu [21 May 2015], Kim Young-taek, a director at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told Reuters by telephone. "There is no possibility of the disease spreading to ordinary people although it is possible to have additional cases among those who contacted the patient and have been isolated," Kim said.

1st identified in humans in 2012, MERS is caused by a coronavirus, from the same family as the one that caused a deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003. There is no cure or vaccine.

The World Health Organization has had reports of 1118 cases, including 423 deaths. There is usually a surge of cases in the northern spring and most cases have come from hospital transmission.

[As mentioned above, this is the 1st reported case of MERS-CoV infection confirmed in South Korea. The media report mentions the individual was in Bahrain for "farming-related business" but does not specifically mention what type of farming was involved, and if there was possible exposure to camels or uncooked camel products (such as milk or urine) during his stay in Bahrain.

According to the most recent ECDC communicable disease threats report on 16 May 2015, as of 13 May 2015, there have been 1142 cases of MERS-CoV reported by local health authorities worldwide, including 465 deaths (reported case fatality rate 40.7 per cent). To date, all cases have either occurred in the Middle East, have direct links to a primary case infected in the Middle East, or have returned from this area -- this latter description fitting the above reported case from South Korea and possibly his spouse. This report provides a breakdown of number of cases reported by country since April 2014. According to this report there have been a total of 11 cases including 4 deaths due to MERS-CoV infection reported from Qatar, and to date no (0) cases of MERS-CoV infection reported by Bahrain; hence it will be important to identify what the possible exposures were for this individual, as neither location mentioned in this individual's travel history are major reporters of MERS-CoV transmission. More information on possible risk exposures in both Bahrain and Qatar would be greatly appreciated.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- Saudi Arabia -- 17 May 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------
Between 4 and 9 May [2015], the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 5 additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the cases are as follows:

1 - A 75 year old male from Abqaiq city developed symptoms on [30 Apr 2015] and was admitted to hospital on 3 May [2015]. He is an ex-smoker and has comorbidities. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Currently, the patient is in stable condition in a negative pressure room on a ward. [Reported as a confirmed case in Agig by MOH on 9 May 2015 - Mod.MPP]

2 - A 61 year old, non-national male from Najran city developed symptoms on [28 Apr 2014] and was admitted to hospital on 1 May [2015]. He had comorbidities. The patient had no history of direct contact with camels or consuming raw milk; however, he lived in an area with camels and sheep. The patient had no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient passed away on 8 May [2015]. [Reported as a confirmed case and fatality by the MOH on 9 May 2015]

3 - A 48 year old male from Taif city developed symptoms on 3 May [2015] and was admitted to hospital on 8 May [2015]. He has comorbidities. Investigation of history of exposure to known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. Currently, the patient is in a critical condition in ICU. [Reported as a confirmed case by the MOH on 9 May 2015. - Mod.MPP]

4 - A 39 year old male from Hofuf city developed symptoms on [28 Apr 2015] and was admitted to hospital on 3 May [2015]. The patient is a smoker and has no comorbidities. He is a contact of a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV case that was reported in a previous DON on [29 Apr 2015] (case no. 2). The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in a critical condition in ICU. [Reported as a confirmed case by MOH on 5 May 2015 and as a fatality on 13 May 2015 (see fatality report No. 3 in section [1] above. - Mod.MPP]

5 - A 41 year old, non-national male from Huraimla city developed symptoms on [13 Apr 2015] and was admitted to hospital on [23 Apr 2015]. He has comorbidities as well as a history of frequent contact with camels and consumption of raw camel milk. The patient has no history of exposure to other known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms. Currently, he is in critical in ICU. [Reported as a confirmed case by the MOH on 4 May 2015. - Mod.MPP]

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for these cases.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1116 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 423 related deaths.

[It is interesting that smoking history is being provided in these reports, suggesting that such a history may be a pre-existing co-morbidity associated with increased risk of serious disease from MERS-CoV infection (not surprising, given the association of smoking and pulmonary disease such as COPD -- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease -- with resultant reduced pulmonary capacity). It would be very interesting to see a statistical analysis of the types of co-morbidities associated with MERS-CoV infection and severity of illness. I can't help but wonder if we are seeing 2 different phenomena related to "co-morbidities" -- an increased risk of severe disease when infected with the MERS-CoV, as well as an increased risk of exposure to a MERS-CoV-infected individual during visits to the healthcare environment for pre-existing co-morbidities. These all present challenges for statistical analyses aimed at defining co-morbidity risks.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) -- United Arab Emirates 18 May 2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 13 May 2015, the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of 1 additional case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection.

Details of the case are as follows:

A 29 year old, non-national male from Abu Dhabi tested positive for MERS-CoV on 12 May [2015]. The patient works as a truck driver and frequently transports camels from Oman to UAE. He travelled to Ibri city, Oman on 6 May [2015] and transported camels to Abu Dhabi on 9 May [2015]. As part of the national policy of testing all imported camels for MERS-CoV, on 9 May [2015], laboratory examinations were carried out on the camels that the truck driver was transporting. The animals tested positive for MERS-CoV on 10 May [2015]. This triggered an investigation of the truck driver, which started on the same day. Following hospital admission, the patient tested positive for MERS-CoV on 12 May [2015]. He was asymptomatic at the time of laboratory testing. The patient has no comorbidities and no history of exposure to other known risk actors in the 14 days prior to detection. Currently, he is asymptomatic in a negative pressure room on a ward.

Contact tracing of household contacts and healthcare contacts is ongoing for the case. The National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates informed the National IHR Focal Point of Oman to undertake the necessary investigation back in Oman.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1118 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 423 related deaths.

[The above case is one of the few reports of asymptomatic disease related to documented exposure to MERS-CoV-infected camels. It will be of interest to see if there are other human infections with MERS-CoV associated with contact with this infected but asymptomatic individual. According to the most recent ECDC communicable disease threats report of 16 May 2015, there have been a total of 74 cases including 10 deaths attributable to MERS-CoV infection in the UAE and 5 confirmed human cases including 3 deaths reported from Oman. (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/communicable-disease-threats-report-16-may-2015.pdf).

One of the earlier MERS-CoV studies of camels in Oman found that 50 out of 50 camels studied showed evidence of past MERS-CoV infection (see prior ProMED post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (52): animal reservoir, research, serology 20130809.1872008) and active MERS-CoV infection has also been demonstrated in Omani camels (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (66): Oman (SH), camel conf, OIE 20140523.2493556). It is curious that this individual has a history of multiple exposures to camels from Oman, yet is just now noted to have evidence of MERS-CoV infection. Was the current test of the individual based on PCR evidence of viral RNA, or was it based on serology? One presumes the former, as the individual is currently hospitalized and isolated, presumed to have an active infection, but the above report does not specify the type of testing conducted. Hence one wonders what was different this time that led to the individual's infection.

[5] UAE, 2nd case - media report, RFI
Date: 20 May 2015
Source: The National [edited]
http://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/abu-dhabi-health-authorities-confirm-second-mers-case


Abu Dhabi Health authorities have confirmed that a 2nd person has tested positive for the MERS respiratory disease.

A 29 year old lorry driver who transported camels from Oman was found to be carrying the virus but not showing any symptoms, as reported on Tue [19 May 2015] by The National. On Wed [20 May 2015], the Health Authority of Abu Dhabi [HAAD] said a 2nd person had been diagnosed with [MERS-CoV], but declined to give further details of the patient.

A HAAD spokesperson said: "Both cases are reported as stable and receiving the necessary medical care. The patients have not shown any symptoms. We confirmed their infection with the virus through investigation, and the patients have been isolated in hospitals as a precautionary measure."

HAAD was also checking the health status of people who had been in contact with the patients. Based on previous similar cases, the officials expect that the 2 patients will recover from the virus in no more than 2 weeks. HAAD said it was working with the Ministry of Health and other authorities to take all precautionary measures based on recommendations from the World Health Organization.

A Ministry of Health spokesman said: "The epidemiological investigation centres in the UAE are working round the clock to report any detection of virus [as quickly as possible]. The ministry is following the situation closely to ensure the health and safety of everyone."

WHO also confirmed there had been a 2nd case. "On 18 May [2015], WHO received a notification of a suspected MERS-CoV case from the National IHR Focal Point of the UAE. However, the case is still being investigated and we can only share the details after case confirmation," said a spokesman.

The 1st patient announced this week was found to be infected after mandatory tests on all imported camels found his animals were carrying the virus. Local health authorities notified the World Health Organisation on [13 May 2015] with the results.

Globally, WHO has been notified of 1118 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, with 423 related deaths.

[This media report suggests a 2nd individual has been confirmed to be positive for MERS-CoV, possibly related to the earlier case (see the WHO report above in section [4]). That might explain why the global tally listed in the WHO report of 17 May 2015 shows a total of 1116 laboratory-confirmed cases and the global tally listed in the WHO report of 18 May 2015 shows a total of 1118 cases, although only 1 newly reported case was confirmed by WHO in that report. There is a brief announcement of 2 confirmed cases on the HAAD website, mentioning both cases were asymptomatic and found through "active case finding" (see http://www.haad.ae/haad/tabid/58/ctl/Details/Mid/417/ItemID/485/Default.aspx). It will be interesting to learn how this case was identified -- was it a co-worker who traveled with the 1st reported case, or was it a close contact of the 1st case, suggestive of a human-to-human contact case? More information on this case would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
