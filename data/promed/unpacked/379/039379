Two men, including one with ties to racist groups, have been arrested with
a car officials fear may be loaded with deadly biological and chemical
agents, the FBI said Thursday.
But the federal agents said they have yet to test the materials in the car
and refused comment on whether the two men planned an attack on civilian
targets.
Among the two waiting arraignment late Thursday afternoon are
microbiologist Larry Wayne Harris, from Ohio, who is on probation for
receiving a vial of deadly bubonic plague bacteria in the mail under false
pretenses.
Harris is a former "lieutenant" in the Aryan Nation, a white supremacist
group, and a former follower of Christian Identity, an anti-Semitic and
anti-black religious movement. According to press reports, he has made
threats in the past about sending deadly materials through the mail. Also
arrested was William Levitt Jr., a part-time resident of Las Vegas.
In Las Vegas, FBI agent Bobby Siller told a news conference that tests
still had to be conducted to determine if anthrax or some other dangerous
substance was in the men's car.
Siller also declined comment on a possible motive and added, "There was no
indication of what the target might have been."
He added, "There is no evidence of any contamination anywhere in the
community. ...It is our belief that they were taking these chemicals there
(to the clinic) to conduct some kind of test. ...Obviously some very
serious consequences could have happened." Defense Department spokesman Ken
Bacon said the FBI asked for military experts to come to the scene when the
material was found. "These are people who are trained to deal with chemical
or biological agents. They have the proper clothing and material for
dealing with it."

[Of course it is important to wait for laboratory confirmation of the
alleged anthrax weapon. However, the technical expertise and facilities
needed for development of such a weapon do not present an overwhelming
barrier, so it is entirely conceived someone with training in microbiology
and minimal facilities could be in possession of such a weapon. Incidents
such as this which highlight the threatened use of biological weapons,
either in the US or elsewhere around the world, raise the stakes in terms
of our need to get our potential public health response organized sooner
rather than later.
