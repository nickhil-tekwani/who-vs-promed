[FMD is endemic in China, historically, the following FMDV serotypes have been identified:
https://www.wrlfmd.org/east-and-southeast-asia/china

FMDV serotype / Year
O / 1958, 1986, 1999-2001, 2003, 2005, 2010-2014, 2016-2018
A / 1951, 1958, 1960, 1962, 1964, 2009-2010, 2013-2015, 2017-2018
Asia / 1 1958, 2005-2009

This current report mentions that "this is the 1st occurrence in yaks (_Bos grunniens_) of foot-and-mouth disease in the country." However, in November 2007, Qinghai Province veterinary agencies reported that yaks on a farm developed Asia type-1 FMD on 24 Oct 2007. The farm had a total of 58 yaks and 19 fell ill. FMD of the Asia-1 type was confirmed by the National FMD Reference Laboratory. See ProMED post 20071103.3569. Yaks, like all cloven-foot animals, are susceptible to FMD.

The following information is from Ayalew W, Chu M, Liang C, et al. Adaptation mechanisms of yak (_Bos grunniens_) to high-altitude environmental stress. Animals (Basel). 2021; 11(8): 2344; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8388626/

"The yaks are the world's most remarkable domestic animal living freely and reproducing under the harsh plateau environment. The yak was domesticated >7300 years ago from wild yak by the early nomadic people and is the only large animal that coexists with its wild ancestors in a similar environment. Over 17.6 million yaks exist globally, and the majority are found in the plateau regions of central Asia, which cover ~2.5 million km2 centered around the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and adjacent highlands. The yak supplies (milk, meat, hair, hides, and manure) and services (draft, packing, and riding) the pastoralists and agro-pastoralists occupying these areas. They are also means of financial security and cultural functions (status, dowry, religious festivals). They also offer a good framework for studying the effects of natural and artificial selection in livestock domestication and adaptation to different environments.

"The yak is the only bovine species native to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and adjacent highlands that exhibits a high adaptability to high altitudes, a low sensitivity to cold, a low oxygen pressure, and prolonged periods (approximately half a year) of food scarcity."
