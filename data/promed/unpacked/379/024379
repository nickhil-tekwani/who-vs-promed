Tick-borne Lyme disease is being reported in areas of Massachusetts
where cases were considered rare 10 years ago, health officials said.
Once found mostly on Cape Cod and surrounding islands, the bacterial
disease is showing up in areas across the state, The Boston Globe
reported Monday [23 Aug 2010].

Previously, cases were largely restricted to people who had visited
Cape Cod and suffered tick bites, the newspaper said. "Now they're
living in Charlton, they're living in Northborough, they're living in
Westborough [These towns are in Worcester County, Massachusetts]," Dr
Richard Ellison, hospital epidemiologist at UMass [University of
Massachusetts] Memorial Medical Center in Worcester, said. "And
they're not traveling to the Cape."

The state Department of Public Health says cases have increased
4-fold in Middlesex, Norfolk, and Worcester counties since 2000. The
disease is spreading, experts said, as deer populations grow and
human developments encroach on natural habitats. Hundreds of ticks
can hitch a ride on a single deer, and one female tick can lay 2000
or more eggs.

"This has been an accident waiting to happen," said Dr Thomas
Treadwell, director of an infectious disease clinic in Framingham,
Massachusetts. "If you don't have the deer, you don't have the tick.
And if you don't have the tick, you don't have the disease. But we
now have the perfect habitat here."

Lyme disease causes flu-like symptoms although serious cardiac and
neurological complications can occur in some patients, the Globe reported.

[Lyme disease is distributed focally within the United States: it is
considered endemic in 8 northeastern states (Connecticut, Delaware,
Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and
Rhode Island) and 2 upper Midwestern (Wisconsin and Minnesota), where
93 percent of cases were reported during 2003-2005
(<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5623a1.htm>). Cases are
reported by county of residence, which is assumed to be the county of
exposure; however, people are often exposed to infected ticks outside
their county of residence. For example, in Massachusetts, people can
be exposed to infected ticks on Cape Cod (Barnstable County) while on
vacation, but they reside mid-state in Worcester County.

Climate change, growth of suburban neighborhoods into surrounding
wooded areas, and enlarging populations of deer, as well as the
white-footed mouse and other small rodents (the primary reservoirs
for Lyme disease) are thought to be responsible for the spread of
Lyme disease. _Ixodes scapularis_, the primary vector for Lyme
disease in the northeastern US, travel into new areas on wildlife and birds.

_I. scapularis_ transmits human granulocytic anaplasmosis, as well as
Lyme disease and babesiosis. Because of a common tick vector, a
patient infected with any one of these pathogens may be co-infected
with other pathogens that the tick vector may be concurrently carrying.
