Two dogs with canine influenza have died as the outbreak continues to sicken hundreds of dogs in the Bloomington-Normal area [Illinois], veterinarians said Monday [16 May 2016].

However, the number of new cases appears to be declining and most dogs are responding to treatment, said Dr. Kirsten Pieper of the Animal Emergency Clinic of McLean County.

The 2 dogs who died had tested positive for canine influenza, said Dr. David Bortell of Bortell Animal Hospital. One dog was older and had chronic but managed medical conditions, and the other was a healthy 2-year-old, he said.

Both dogs were admitted to the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Illinois for intensive care but died despite the treatment, he said.

"Both owners agreed to necropsy (autopsy), which will give us a final determination," said Trudy Shea, Bortell Animal Hospital practice manager.

"There have been outbreaks of kennel cough but I've never seen anything like this in the 18 years that I've been here," Bortell said.

Added Pieper, "We've had kennel cough and parvovirus, but we haven't had a virus outbreak this severe."

"This is the worst of any viral outbreak I've seen," added Dr. Tim Anderson of Hawthorne Park Animal Care Center, which includes a veterinary practice, dog boarding and grooming.

Dr. Michelle Gundlach, director of education for the Illinois State Veterinary Medical Association, said, "We're not aware of any other confirmed cases of canine influenza in Illinois at this time other than in the Bloomington-Normal area."

Most likely, a dog from Bloomington-Normal traveling elsewhere in the country caught the virus and brought it back to Central Illinois, Gundlach said.

An Illinois Department of Agriculture veterinarian was in Bloomington-Normal on Friday [13 May 2016] to assess the outbreak, Pieper said. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has asked for nasal swabs of some infected dogs.

"They are trying to get a better idea of the strain of the virus," she said.

Vets are concerned because the H3N2 canine influenza strain is new and few dogs have been exposed to it or vaccinated against it so they have no protection. That means that nearly every dog exposed to it is sick for a week or 2.

Anderson said the severity of illness has varied. He and Pieper said that they are seeing fewer new cases compared with a week ago.

"We're not out of the woods yet," Pieper said.

But she said the quick response of the community appears to be slowing the spread of the virus.

Vets advise dog owners to keep their dogs home as much as possible until the outbreak passes. Dogs may be contagious for up to 30 days after they are exposed to the virus, vets said.

Dog owners whose dogs have appointments for boarding, grooming or day care should make sure that their dogs are vaccinated for canine influenza, vets said. Also, avoid dog parks and -- when your dog is on his or her daily walk -- keep the pet away from other dogs until the outbreak has passed, they said.

Dr. Bhanusree Vatti with Bortell Animal Hospital recommended that dog owners use pet sitters until the outbreak ends. Canine influenza can't be passed to humans, but can infect cats, Guinea pigs and ferrets.

Katherine Sieraski, owner of Paradise Pet Hotel & Day Spa, said that in addition to usual precautions, Paradise is separating dogs and employees who care for them. In one building are dogs who have not had the virus and who are getting vaccinated. In the other building are dogs who have had the virus, have finished their medicines and haven't showed signs for at least a week.

The virus has been devastating to dogs, dog owners and pet care businesses, who have experienced a decline in numbers, Sieraski said.

"We are taking every precaution we can," Sieraski said.

Hawthorne is requiring dogs coming in for grooming or boarding to be vaccinated, Anderson said.

"No one is at fault," Pieper said. "This is a virus. I want to commend everyone for taking this seriously."
