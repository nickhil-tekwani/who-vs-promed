Several Western gulls which were found dead on Huntington Beach last month [Oct 2019] have unexpectedly tested positive for a type of botulism which is more commonly detected in humans.

The nonprofit Wetland and Wildlife Care Center (WWCC) initially reported that 8 Western gulls were discovered dead, and 4 more in critical condition, on [10 Oct 2019] at high tide on Huntington Beach. The 4 gulls found alive were unable to move or close their eyes. One of them died and the other 3 survived after being cared for by WWCC staff.

The University of California, Davis conducted necropsies on 5 of the deceased gulls and discovered that they had the toxin botulism type A, which is more common in humans and often caused by improperly canned food, the WWCC reported. In a news release, the WWCC explained that gulls infected with botulism usually have type C or type E.

Over the past few weeks, 5 more gulls have been brought in to WWCC showing similar symptoms; 2 of those have since died.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, botulism is a rare bacterial illness in which a toxin attacks the body's nerves. It can cause difficulty breathes, muscle paralysis and even death. It can be transmitted through contaminated foods or if the spores of the bacteria get into a wound.

The WWCC is asking the public to bring any gulls they see to their animal hospital, which is located at 21900 Pacific Coast Highway.

[Avian botulism is a paralytic disease caused by ingestion of a toxin produced by the bacteria _Clostridium botulinum_. These bacteria are widespread in soil and require warm temperatures, a protein source, and an anaerobic (no oxygen) environment in order to become active and produce toxin.

A total of 7 immunologically distinct toxins, designated by the letters A to G, are produced by different strains, which are classified into toxinotypes A-G according to the type of toxin produced. Birds (poultry and waterfowl) are most commonly affected by type C and to a lesser extent type E. Type C toxin is found in waterfowl, shorebirds, colonial waterbirds, and others; whereas Type E toxin in gulls, loons, and others. Types A, B, E, and rarely F, cause human botulism. Type A toxin occasionally causes botulism in domestic chickens. - Mod.PMB
