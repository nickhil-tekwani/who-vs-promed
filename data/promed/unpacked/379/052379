Coconino County Public Health Services District (CCPHSD) has received confirmation that several students who attended a team-building event at Camp Colton from 1-3 Aug 2014 have tested positive for tickborne relapsing fever (TBRF). The students are all receiving the proper medical treatment and all students are in stable condition.

The Coconino County Public Health Services District (CCPHSD) is collaborating with healthcare providers, Flagstaff Unified School District, Camp Colton, Arizona Department of Health Services and Northern Arizona University in this investigation.

Camp Colton will be closed temporarily to allow for a full inspection of the facility. CCPHSD is working with Flagstaff Unified School District (FUSD) officials to ensure that the proper precautions are taken to reduce the risk of exposure to TBRF and to help inform all parents of the students who participated in the event of the details of this illness and the appropriate action if symptoms develop.

It is important to note that TBRF cannot be transmitted from one person to another. Anyone who has possibly been exposed to rodents or ticks and is exhibiting these symptoms should contact a healthcare provider.

_Borrelia_ bacteria that cause TBRF are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected "soft ticks" of the genus _Ornithodoros_ (_O. hermsi_, _O. parkeri_ and _O. turicata_.) _Ornithodoros hermsi_ tends to be found at higher altitudes (1500 to 8000 feet/457-2438 m) where it is associated primarily with rodents including mice, tree ground squirrels, and chipmunks. The other types, _O. parkeri_ and _O. turicata_, are found at lower altitudes.

Soft ticks differ in 2 important ways from the more familiar "hard ticks" which include the dog tick and the deer tick. First, the bite of soft ticks is brief, usually lasting less than half an hour and second, soft ticks do not search for prey in tall grass or brush. Instead, they live within rodent burrows, feeding as needed on the rodent as it sleeps.

Relapsing fever is characterized by episodes of fever lasting several days, followed by an interval without fever, followed by another episode of fever. This process can recur from 1 to 4 times. Along with fever, patients may experience generalized body aches, muscle pain, joint pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, dry cough, light sensitivity, rash, neck pain, eye pain, confusion, and dizziness. Anyone who has possibly been exposed to rodents or ticks and is exhibiting these symptoms should contact a health care provider.

TBRF is found in areas throughout the world. In the United States, TBRF occurs most commonly in 14 western states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. No cases of TBRF have been reported in Coconino County during the past 14 years. Since 2009, 5 probable or confirmed cases have been reported in Arizona.

To prevent exposure to TBRF, the following guidelines should be followed:
- Avoid sleeping in rodent-infested buildings.
- Prevent tick bites by using insect repellent containing DEET (on skin or clothing) or permethrin (applied to clothing or equipment).
- Rodent-proof buildings in areas where the disease is known to occur.
- Consult a licensed pest control specialist who can safely: identify and remove any rodent nesting material from walls, attics, crawl spaces, and floors; treat "cracks and crevices" in the walls with pesticide; and provide additional pesticide treatments as necessary to effectively rid the building of the soft ticks.

A Flagstaff Unified School District summer camp was canceled this week because at least 5 students tested positive for a rare tickborne disease. The Arizona Daily Sun reports that officials are trying to determine how the students attending Camp Colton contracted tickborne relapsing fever.

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the fever is a bacterial infection characterized by fever, headache, muscle and joint aches, and nausea.

Coconino County Chief Health Officer Marie Peoples says the illness is easily treated with antibiotics. According to the CDC, the fever is usually linked to sleeping in rustic, rodent-infested cabins in mountainous areas. FUSD spokeswoman Karin Eberhard said the camp's buildings were professional cleaned and treated. She says the camp will not reopen until health officials' investigation finishes.
