[Newcastle disease and Infectious bronchitis are not rare in poultry
throughout the globe. Since data on their incidence in the People's
Republic of China are not readily available, we found it useful to post the
following article, published recently in a Chinese farmers' journal from
which it was translated. Dan Silver, the translator/sender, is gratefully
acknowledged. - Mod.AS]

Combined infection of Newcastle disease and nephropathogenic infectious
bronchitis in laying hens
------------------------------------
Newcastle Disease (ND) is a highly infectious disease of chickens caused by
paramyxovirus, often presenting a septicemic process. It is characterized
by breathing difficulty, diarrhea, and manifestation of nervous symptoms.
In recent years, chicken flocks have been widely vaccinated against
Newcastle disease, making Newcastle disease shift toward atypical type[s],
appearing sporadically. Atypical Newcastle disease, in particular, often
appears among vaccinated chicken flocks, and is characterized by
respiratory symptoms, diarrhea, high morbidity, and low mortality. When
chicken flocks are infected with Newcastle disease virus, disease
resistance is low, making them vulnerable to infectious bronchitis virus,
causing large-scale [chicken] deaths and substantial economic losses to the
chicken breeding industry.
Disease occurrence and symptoms, 9 Jan 2007
-------------------------------------------
1000 laying hens raised by Mr Sun in Xiangchenggu Township of Qiu County in
Hebei Province; normal farming practices; vaccinated in accordance with
normal vaccination procedures against Marek's disease, Newcastle disease,
infectious bronchitis, infectious bursal disease, infectious
laryngotracheitis. Caged at 50 days old. At 60 days old, Newcastle disease
I type and avian pox vaccines. At 87 days old, illness appeared suddenly.
That day, 5 chickens died. The next day, 19 died. Ill chickens were
lethargic, feathers limp, food intake declined; [they] passed
white-liquid-like diarrhea, volume of water intake increased; some sick
chickens had breathing difficulties and mouths were open with necks
outstretched, some sick chickens coughed and sneezed with rales in the
trachea when breathing. Main symptoms in the flock were reduced appetite,
refusal to eat, increased thirst, passing white urea diarrhea, and
respiratory tract symptoms.
Drinkable amoxicillin, sulfamethoxazole mixed in feed, and other treatment
measures were used immediately but had no effect whatsoever.
Illnesses and deaths continued. On 15 Jan 2007, dead chickens were taken to
Xingtai City Veterinary Hospital for further diagnosis.
After dissection and analysis, the diagnosis of combined infection with
Newcastle disease and nephropathogenic infectious bronchitis was made.
Comprehensive prevention and treatment measures were promptly taken and the
outbreak was quickly contained.

[Though Newcastle disease (NCD) has been, until recently, an Office
International des Epizooties list A disease (requiring immediate
notification), no information on its incidence in PRC has been sent to the
OIE during (at least) the last 6 years. It is to be hoped that the recent
improvement in China's reporting on some animal diseases, such as foot and
mouth disease and avian influenza, will cover also other topics, NCD
included. When/if reported, data on the pathogenicity of the involved virus
strains will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
