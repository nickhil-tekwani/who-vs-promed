Among a specific French population of travelers under strict epidemiological surveillance, from August to November 2020, we report a statistically significant increase in the incidence of severe malaria attacks (_Plasmodium falciparum_) compared with historical data (+167%).

The causes of this increase are not an increase in the incidence of malaria attack (stable between 2019 and 2020), nor the observance of chemoprophylaxis (stable between 2019 and 2020), but the mean delay to diagnosis has increased (1.43 days in 2019, 5.5 days in 2020), perhaps due to misdiagnosis because of COVID-19 fever.

We would like to alert subscribers on this subject to improve the management of these malaria attacks.

[An increase in the diagnostic delay from 1.4 days to 5.5 days means that malaria-infected persons will have a much more severe illness, which is likely to increase mortality also. There can be several explanations, but the key issue to an early diagnosis is that physicians ask every patient with fever "Have you been travelling?". Also, persons travelling should be advised to inform about their travel should they develop any illness after return. - Mod.EP
