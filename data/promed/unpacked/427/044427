The Prefecture of St Martin and St Barths and the health authority of Guadeloupe have confirmed a case of cholera imported into St Martin. The Louis-Constant Fleming Hospital had indicated the case as "probable" in a release on Thu 6 Dec 2012. However, it now has been declared positive following verification of the exam result by the Institute Pasteur in Paris.

It was understood the patient had been infected following a stay in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. Subsequent investigations by Pole de Veille Sanitaire in conjunction with Cellule de L'Institut National de Veille Sanitaire have indicated there are no secondary cases. Surveillance is being maintained as a precaution.

Haiti and Santo Domingo are currently affected by a cholera epidemic, a sickness caused by the bacteria _Vibrio cholerae_. It is characterised by severe diarrhoea that leads to dehydration. In its release, the Prefecture advises any persons who have these symptoms to consult their doctors immediately.

[Cases of cholera from Haiti/Dominican Republic have been imported into Cuba as well as the USA. In areas with adequate sanitary systems, significant spread of this organism is quite unlikely.

Saint Martin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Martin) is an island in the north east Caribbean, about 300 km (190 mi) east of Puerto Rico. The island is divided roughly 60/40 between France and the Netherlands. It is one of the smallest sea islands divided between 2 nations, a division dating to 1648. The northern French part comprises the Collectivite de Saint-Martin (Collectivity of St Martin) and is an overseas collectivity of France. - Mod.LL
