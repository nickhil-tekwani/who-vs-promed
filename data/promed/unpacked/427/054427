Ecuador has registered an increased increment in
dengue cases so far this year [2010] in relation
to totals for the same period in 2009. The
Subsecretary of Health for the Costa Insular
region, Marcelo Aguilar, said to BBC Mundo that
up until now in the country, especially in the
coastal provinces, 3985 dengue cases have been
treated, which represents 3.5 times more than
were detected in the 1st 10 weeks in the previous
year [2009]. Of these, this year [2010] there
have been a total of 78 DHF cases, the
[clinically] most lethal variety of the disease.
Subsecretary Aguillar indicated that just one
dengue death has been confirmed in the country
and added that the Ministry of Health is working
to prevent high indices of death caused by
[dengue virus] transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_
mosquito vector of the disease [virus]. The
official said that sanitary actions to combat the
mosquito could extend until June.

The increase in the number of dengue cases has
been caused, according to Aguillar, by "climatic
anomalies" which have affected Ecuadorian coastal
zones, such as an increase in temperature up to 3
degrees [C, 5.4F] above usual levels, as well as
high environmental humidity, "which generate
extraordinary conditions for the reproduction of
the mosquito." The proliferation of _Aedes
aegypti_ moreover, has been facilitated by
deficient sanitary conditions in various areas of
the country. "Problems with trash collection and
water management, as well as the lack of basic
infrastructure, create constant conditions which
produce dengue outbreaks," indicated Aguillar.

El Oro province, on the south Coast of Ecuador,
has been most affected by the presence of dengue
in the country. In this province, on the border
of Peru, up to now has registered 2042 classical
dengue cases and 46 of DHF, and have established
epidemiological barriers there through fumigation
that permit combat against the mosquito that
transmits the disease [virus].

The Director of the Teofilo Davila Hospital, the
main one of the province, Jose Ojeda, indicated
to BBC Mundo that the high dengue incidence in El
Oro is related to public health problems and lack
of public health education of the population.
"Cities, when they undergo unorganized increases
with the lack of basic services such as provision
of potable water and trash collection, and with
inadequate waste water drainage, are exposed to
the proliferation of diverse diseases such as
dengue," said the Director. However, Ojeda stated
that the impact of dengue is being offset by
action by health organizations and the community.
"If we were not prepared to confront this
disease, perhaps many more would have died among
those infected with DHF," he concluded.

In urban areas, the housing boom with the
consequent generation of waste materials, could
contribute of the increase in the number of
dengue cases, according to a pioneering study
done in Rio de Janeiro, published recently in the
journal Waste Management [Sampaio, A.M.M. /
Kligerman, D.C. / Junior, S.F. 2009, Dengue,
related to rubble and building construction in
Brazil, Waste Management, 29 (11), p.2867-2873,
in English].

The mosquito _Aedes aegypti_, transmitter of
dengue [viruses] reproduce where there is water
collection. Because of that, the accumulation of
trash in illegal areas or their incorrect
storage, make possible the accumulation of rain
water which leads, as a consequence, to
proliferation of the mosquito.

The Jacarepagua neighborhood which currently has
the greatest increase in the rate of construction
of buildings and condominiums was the highest in
[dengue] incidence. On the other hand, the the
districts in south Rio, such as Copacabana for
example, where the urbanization is more
consolidated and there is less construction, they
have had a lesser [dengue infection] rate. It was
surprising that the prevalence of the [dengue]
epidemic was not more intense in the poorest
neighborhoods of the city, rather it was those
that had the greatest quantity of trash,
underscored Sampaio. These results reinforce the
necessity of correctly handling remains of
materials generated by the construction industry.

[In the emerging economies of South America, the
construction industry is that which is most
dynamic and progressive. New apartment buildings
and condominiums are being erected constantly,
although the buildings do not always meet the
norms for safety and hygiene. On the other hand,
owner-construction of housing without respect to
the norms cited previously is the rule, rather
than the exception, particularly in the marginal
slums of the large cities. The recent disasters
in Haiti and Chile bring about intense
reconstruction efforts for new housing, which
also highlight the importance of this report, in
which in addition to describing the potential
problem, propose alternatives to at least
alleviate the problem. Now it is the turn of the
local authorities to make sure that the norms are
strictly complied with and to honor their
responsibility. - Mod.JG]

Announcement of the test results this Friday [19
Mar 2010], issued by the Instituto Adolfo Lutz,
stated that Santos is living through a dengue
epidemic. The city on the Sao Paulo Coast,
exceeded the level that kept it in an outbreak
situation; now there are 163 confirmed cases per
100 000 inhabitants. The limit for a municipality
with more than 250 000 residents -- Santos has
417 000 -- to be outside an epidemic status is
100 cases per 100 000 population. Up to now,
Santos officially registered a total of 680 cases.

The municipal Secretary of Health, Od√≠lio
Rodrigues Filho, has now announced a new measure:
starting now, all the municipal or private
hospitals and medical units must dispense with
laboratory tests (serological) to detect the
occurrence of dengue [virus infections]. For
example, it will be sufficient for physicians to
use clinical-epidemiological criteria. If the
[health] professional verifies that the patients
presents with a clinical picture that is
suspicious [of dengue virus infection], it will
be considered a confirmed case, explained
Rodrigues Filho. Another measure cited by
Rodrigues Filho was the suspension of the
[appointment] schedules for Basic Health Units
(BHUs). We adopted free demand [attention].
Whoever comes with [dengue] symptoms will be seen.

Dengue exceeds 4000 cases in Ribeirao
-----------------------------------
The city is approaching the [dengue case] mark
registered in 2006, when it had the worst
epidemic of the disease. The number of confirmed
dengue cases in Ribeirao Preto yesterday [16 Mar
2010] reached the mark of 4164, according to the
municipal Secretariat of Health, placing it in
2nd place for the worst epidemic of the disease
there in 11 years. The projection of
Epidemiological Surveillance is that 2010 will
surpass the total number of cases registered the
last 4 years, when 5997 cases were confirmed. The
current number of confirmed cases surpass the
number in the 1st quarter of 2006, when 2156
cases of the disease were reported. As of
yesterday, there have been another 3392 suspected
[cases].

According to the [municipal health] Secretary,
Carla Palhares, the number of [patients] who were
attended for consultations in the Basic Health
Units (UBDSs), as well as those attended in
emergency units of hospitals, have registered an
increase of nearly 30 percent due to dengue. The
UBDSs with most demand are Vila Virginia and
Central. In the 1st, 10 210 persons sought
[medical] attention in the 1st 2 weeks of March
[2010]. In the 2nd, for the same period, 8436
people were attended to.

[The problem is not limited to the number of
cases. There is dengue [virus] transmission in
localities in which there has not been [dengue]
previously or was of low intensity [such as]:
Distrito Federal, Rio Grande do Sul and
Argentina. The number of deaths increases. -

The Secretariat of Health admitted that the
[current] number of cases of the disease[dengue]
in the Distrito Federal [Federal District, DF]
has never been registered previously. There are
now 1956 confirmed [cases], 415 more than the
previous week [week of 7 Mar 2010]. The
government also recognizes that the [case]
statistics could be underreported.

The Distrito Federal is living through its worst
epidemic of all time. These are the words of the
Subsecretary of Health Surveillance, Alan Kardec.
Yesterday [16 Mar 2010], The Secretariat of
Health announced that there are now 1956
confirmed dengue cases, a number 1503 percent
more than at the beginning of last year [2009].
Given this increase in statistics, technical
personnel in the health sector researched health
surveys done in previous years and not found
similar situations. "We are alarmed," admits
Kardec.

To combat the problem, a crisis cabinet, before
with Subsecretariat administered by Kardec, is
now under the command by the Secretary of Health
Joaquim Barros, starting as of next Tuesday [23
Mar 2010]. The Secretariat of Health also
discussed carrying out a day of awareness for the
fight against dengue. On that date, which will be
scheduled for the beginning or mid-April, the
press will be called, pamphlets will be
distributed and mobilizations are planned in
communities. According to an advisor to the
Subsecretariat of Health, Aiton Domicio da Silva,
what is most serious at the moment is the number
of confirmed registered [cases] and that the
disease has spread to various regions of the
Distrito Federal. "The situation is not out of
control, but it is worrying," he stated.

The picture could be even more serious than the
official numbers demonstrate. According to
Subsecretary Allan Kardec, the number of ill
people [with dengue] could be an underestimate
due to underreporting, that is to say, infected
people and even [health] posts and hospitals are
not reporting the data for health services to
Environmental Surveillance.

Of the 11 deaths that might have been related to
dengue, 2 were confirmed [as dengue], 4 were
discarded [not dengue-related] and 5 continue
under investigation. The region in which has the
greatest concentration of [dengue case] reports
continues to be Asa Norte, including Vila
Planalto, with 588 confirmed cases. Planaltina is
in 2nd place, with 299 cases. [Others include]
Planaltina - 299, Itapoa - 256, Sao Sebastiao -
127, Paranoa - 99 and Guara - 87 [cases].

[In summary] the scale of the disease [outbreak]
is 4294 suspected [dengue] cases in all of the
DF, 1956 confirmed cases.

Of the 1191 [dengue] cases, there are now 3
deaths and there are 300 hospitalized patients,
according to health authorities. They recommend
that those who have dengue symptoms do not travel
during Easter Week. Paraguay is suffering the
impact of dengue with more than 1191 ill
individuals and 3 patients who died, according to
the announcement by Ivan Allende, Director of the
Office of Sanitary Surveillance of the Ministry
of Public Health. This epidemiological outbreak
began in December [2009], according to the
office, and since then the number increased to
1191 cases. To date, moreover, there are about
300 hospitalized patients and 11 serious cases.
The Paraguay Ministry of Public Health is
carrying out a campaign for dengue eradication in
the areas most affected in the country, such as
the Alto Parana department [state of province
equivalent], where there are more than 500
patients with dengue symptoms, and the Amabay
department.

Allende recommended that Paraguayans with
dengue-related symptoms not travel "to not place
at risk the population in the interior of the
country," according to statements by the Ministry
of Public Health. At Easter Week there is usually
a "spike" of the epidemic, "which reflects the
outbreaks within the country," Allende said. "One
of the recommendations is not to travel with
fever or symptoms of dengue, because it may put
at risk the population of other districts," he
said.

Paraguay has had the [dengue] epidemic for 6
months, and "it is very intense," he stated.

The latest report from the National
Epidemiological Unit issued on 18 [Mar 2010]
shows that there are now 24 municipalities with
dengue present in 7 of the 9 departments [state
or province equivalents] in Bolivia. The
epidemiological section of the Ministry of Health
stated, moreover, that to date there are 266
laboratory confirmed [dengue] cases and 2586
suspected [cases], as well as maintaining an
"alarm zone" in this Andean country before
declaring an epidemic.

"We have had a marked increase since Friday of
the previous week [12 Mar 2010] 100 - 150 samples
have begun to come in [to the laboratory for
dengue testing]. And so this says that generally
the physicians, when a patient comes in with a
fever, they think it is dengue and send in
[samples] for rule-outs," said the Director of
the National Center for Tropical Disease
(CENETROP), Jorge Vargas.

In turn, the head of the regional program of
diseases transmitted by vectors of the
Epidemiological Unit, Juan Calos Arraya,
explained the the [dengue virus] incursion into
the "alarm zone" is determined based on dengue
behavior in the last 5-7 years. The exception is
2009 because this was an epidemic year with more
than 40 000 cases and nearly 50 deaths. "Always,
each year there are outbreaks and their magnitude
varies from year to year; in 2010 we can say that
we have a mild outbreak in relation to last year.
Dengue has to do with the rains, due to the
accumulation of fresh water and are places where
[the mosquito vector] deposits its eggs," stated
Vargas.

He stated that of all the samples that come into
CENETROP, 10 - 15 percent are positive [for
dengue].

"In places where cases are appearing, SEDES
(Departmental Health Services) are fumigating,
[mounting] campaigns so that people do not
accumulate water and a national alarm does not
exist. We will see how it goes next week," he
explained.

According to Health [Ministry] reports, there are
approximately 20-25 [new] cases each day. "We do
not predict a dengue epidemic -- everything is
under control. Yes, a small dengue outbreak
exists and will be controlled; in comparison with
last year [2009], we are far away [from a similar
epidemic]," stated Arraya.

[It is always risky to say, "everything is under
control," when diseases such as dengue can cause
sudden, explosive outbreaks or epidemics, and
control of the vector is so difficult and often
ineffective. It would be of interest to know
which dengue virus serotypes of the 4 is
circulating in Bolivia currently. This report
does not indicate which of 7 of the 9 departments
has confirmed dengue cases. Presumably
transmission is occurring in those departments
that have areas within in the tropical Amazon
Basin, and especially Santa Cruz department which
was especially hard hit in the 2009 epidemic.
