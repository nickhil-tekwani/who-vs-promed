Health authorities in Sierra Leone`s Kono district have confirmed an outbreak of Measles in the area. According to reports Thursday [28 May 2015], the World Health Organization has dispatched emergency support and have engaged local health personnel in training to face a new threat mostly dangerous to children. The viral disease starts with fever, running nose and cough, with the patient`s eyes getting red and soon suffers sore throat.

Kono was declared a "Measles-Positive District" following test of 21 samples which returned 5 positive cases, said Sahr Amara Moiba, Kono District Disease Surveillance Officer, Ministry of Health and Sanitation (MoHS). He said the tests were carried out at the Central Reference Laboratory in Freetown. Moiba said the disease was confirmed in 7 out of 14 chiefdoms in the district: Fiama, Nimikoro, Nimiyama, Gorama Kono, Sandor, Tankoro and Gbense. 98 percent of the cases are children under 1 year of age, he added.

Hundreds of health workers from 84 Peripheral Health Units (PHUs) in the 14 chiefdoms of the district have been trained on treating the sickness, he disclosed. But that training, according Moiba, was also designed to prepare for the forthcoming national vaccination exercise for children against the measles virus, scheduled for 5 and 10 Jun 2015.

As of 3 May, 4127 suspected cases of measles have been reported in Sudan, with 2336 cases confirmed. The total number of deaths in 2015 has risen to 35, with recent fatalities reported in East Darfur.

East, West, and North Darfur account for 25 of the 35 reported deaths (71.4 percent). The total number of outbreak affected localities remained the same as previous weeks, with 32 affected localities in 14 states, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan reported in its bulletin last week.

The majority of measles cases continue to be reported by hospitals, indicating a high incidence of complicated cases that require inpatient care, the bulletin reads.

The 1st phase of a measles vaccination campaign, run by the Ministry of Health (MoH) and supported by the UN World Health Organisation (WHO), UNICEF, and local health partners, began on 22 Apr 2015 and lasted for roughly 10 days. About 1.66 million children aged 6 months to 15 years in 28 of the highest-risk localities across 6 states were targeted.

"Measles is a life-threatening disease, but can easily be prevented with timely immunisation," Unicef Representative in Sudan Geert Cappelaere said at the launch of the campaign. "Every girl and boy must be reached, no matter where they live. There are no excuses and no child can be left out."

Sudan has 1 of the highest levels of malnutrition in Africa. 36 percent of the children are stunted, which is a primary manifestation of undernutrition. For malnourished children, measles can cause serious complications, including blindness, ear infections, pneumonia, and severe diarrhoea.

Health Officials Issue Warning After Measles Case Confirmed in New Jersey
--------------------
The outbreak began in upper Manhattan and the Bronx, and 3 of the latest cases were identified on the Lower East Side. Health officials in New Jersey are issuing a measles warning after they say a person confirmed to have the highly contagious illness may have exposed others to it at a funeral home on 2 occasions earlier in May 2015. The sick individual may have exposed people to the viral infection at Flynn and Son Funeral Home on Ford Avenue in Fords, Middlesex County, on the afternoons of 11 and 14 May 2015. Anyone who may have been at the funeral home on those days is urged to contact a health care provider to discuss potential risks of exposure and ensure he or she is up to date on vaccinations, health officials say.

Symptoms may not develop until as late as 4 Jun 2015, officials said. Health officials said the individual with measles did not know he or she was contagious while visiting the funeral home those 2 days. Measles is a viral infection characterized by a generalized rash and high fever, accompanied by cough, red eyes and runny nose, lasting 5-6 days. The illness typically begins with a rash on the face and then moves down the body, and may include the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

It spreads easily through the air when an infected person talks, coughs or sneezes. People can also get sick when they come in contact with mucus or saliva from an infected person. Anyone who hasn't been vaccinated or has not had measles in the past is at risk if they are exposed to the virus.

As many as 1 in 3 people with measles develop complications, which can be serious and may include pneumonia, miscarriage, brain inflammation, hospitalization and death. Infants, people who have a weakened immune system, and non-immune pregnant women are at highest risk of severe illness and complications.

3 more cases linked to the Ever Rich Duty-free shop in Neihu Airport [Taiwan Taoyuan International is an international airport serving the capital city of Taiwan - Mod.CP] Taipei, and the northern parts of the country. Located about 40 km west of Taipei in Dayuan District, Taoyuan City, Taiwan, the airport is Taiwan's largest airport. The 3 additional cases of measles were confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC, Taiwan), yesterday, adding to the total number of diagnoses in a case of group infections starting from the Ever Rich Duty Free Shop in Neihu, according to CDC officials.

On 19 May 2015, the CDC confirmed that 4 colleagues working at the Ever Rich Duty Free Shop in Neihu were infected with measles. According to the CDC, the disease may have been passed by foreign visitors, most likely from a group from mainland China that had just been to the shop. For precautionary reasons, most employees of Ever Rich have been asked to be vaccinated against the disease, officials added.

According to officials, another 3 cases of measles were confirmed yesterday, with 2 men and a woman coming down with the disease. The total diagnoses of this group infection case have now reached 7 individuals. Officials said that the 3 patients confirmed yesterday had been in personal contact with the 4 workers from Ever Rich.

Measles is a highly infectious respiratory disease that is spread by contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of an infected person, either directly or through aerosol transmission. With the increasing number of diagnoses, the number of people in contact with the patients is growing, making it more and more difficult for the CDC to launch preventative measures and trace all contacts back for examination.

According to the CDC, the female patient went on 13 May 2015 to MYST, a night club at ATT 4 FUN, and then took the MRT from Zhongxiao Fuxing Station to Ximen Station on the morning of 14 May 2015; 1 of the male patients commutes daily between MRT Longshan Temple Station and Ximen Station.

The number of people in contact with the patients has now reached 1668, among whom 216 have yet to be tracked down for examination. According to the CDC, an infected person remains infectious 4 days before and after the development of rash. Physicians are urged to remain vigilant for suspected cases. If symptoms such as fever, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and a rash develop, patients are to seek immediate medical advice, reduce the possibility of further transmission, and inform medical authorities of relevant travel and exposure history.

Deputy Director-General of the CDC Chou Chih-ha reminded that people who were at the Ever Rich Duty Free Shop in Neihu from 23 Apr to 21 May 2015, or any of the other locations mentioned above, should be extremely attentive for any symptoms.

A 31-year-old woman, as well as 2 men aged 27 and 28, were confirmed to be infected with measles yesterday. All 3 work at the Ever Rich Duty Free Shop Neihu branch, where the contagious disease was 1st reported on 19 May 2015. The latest diagnoses bring the total number of infections at the duty-free shop to 10, in addition to the 1930 individuals known to have had direct contact with the infected persons, 346 of whom are still being tracked down for examination.

Officials revealed the locations that the 3 patients have visited recently, warning that anyone who has been in contact with the infected individuals or has visited the areas should be attentive to any symptoms and remain in isolation for 18 days if possible.

Locations include MRT Qizhang Station, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hall Station, Taipei Main Station's Suddenly Hair salon, Second Floor Cafe, Vie Show Cinemas Taipei Q Square, Xindian Household Registration Office, Tri-Service General Hospital, Taishin International Bank Xindian Branch, Taiwan Cooperative Bank Liouhe Branch and Xindian Wufeng Post Office.

According to the CDC, upon discovery of symptoms such as fever, rhinitis, conjunctivitis or rash, patients are to seek immediate medical attention, avoid potential transmission and inform medical authorities of relevant travel and exposure history. See: http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national-news/2015/5/29/437131/Twelve-cases.htm

Furthermore measles Diagnoses has been growing worldwide. More than 35 000 cases of measles infection have been confirmed so far in 2015 around the world, with 40 percent found in Western Pacific areas and Africa, officials said. Sustained spread of the disease has been reported in China, which has accumulated more than 22 700 diagnoses from January to April 2015; the disease also hit Mongolia hard in March 2015.

Police in Papua New Guinea vowed to find the men who axed to death a woman accused of using witchcraft to spark a measles outbreak in the country's remote jungle highlands, a missionary said on Wed 27 May 2015 after meeting authorities.

The woman was 1 of 4 women accused with 13 of their family members of using sorcery to cause measles deaths during November 2014 in the village of Fiyawena, in Enga province, said the Lutheran missionary Anton Lutz.

Women are often accused and killed in witch hunts, even though laws passed in 2013 make revenge killings over black magic punishable by death. Human Rights Watch earlier in 2015 named Papua New Guinea as among the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman due to gender-based violence. Lutz, an American who grew up in the South Pacific nation, led a group of about 20 missionaries and local police to Fiyawena in January 2015 to intervene and save the women's lives.

But last week about 10 men from a village across the river from Fiyawena, armed with homemade guns, axes and machetes, attacked 2 of the women and killed 1 in front of her family, witnesses from the village told Lutz. "Police have promised to move in and take action," Lutz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone after meeting with local and provincial police in Enga's capital Wabag. "The villagers are still scared that the men will come back. It's still a tense situation for the community," he said, adding that the only access to the village is by walking for several hours or getting a plane to a local landing strip. "It's deep jungle out there ... This is a big piece of jungle for people to hide in." Police could not immediately be reached for comment.

Papua New Guinea is among the poorest countries in the world with the majority of its 7 million people living in traditional societies. People in the country are deeply superstitious and accusations of sorcery are commonly used to explain deaths caused by disease or to kill rivals or enemies.

"Public health officials are well versed in carrying out what is known as contact tracing, which involves reaching as many people as possible who could have been potentially exposed to measles. They can then be advised about what measures they need to take if they have, or develop measles-like symptoms."

Dr Mackie says cases like these show how important it is for people to get immunised against measles, or to check their immunisation status if they are unsure. It usually takes 10-14 days for someone who has caught measles to start showing any symptoms. Unimmunised people who have had contact with a person with measles will normally be advised to stay at home and away from all public places, school or work for 14 days after their contact. Measles is highly contagious -- the virus from an infected person can stay in the air for up to an hour and infect people; therefore you can get infected without having been in direct contact with the case.

2 doses of the measles vaccine is all you need to protect yourself, your family and your community. Vaccination is particularly important if you are planning to travel anywhere overseas -- to protect yourself and to help prevent outbreaks in New Zealand.

Public health officers are tracing people who may have been exposed to the measles virus after a case has been identified in Manawatu. The person was taking part in a charity firefighter tower climb at Auckland's Sky City and stayed at the hotel over the weekend of 22-24 May 2015 while they were infectious.

The Chief Medical Officer, Dr Don Mackie, says measles is a highly infectious and potentially serious disease. Immunisation is however highly effective. "As there were a large number number of people from many parts of the country who were potentially exposed during the weekend, public health units nationwide have been notified so they can take suitable steps. If you are someone who thinks you might have been at risk of exposure, it's important you contact your local public health unit," says Dr Mackie.

"Public health officials are well versed in carrying out what is known as contact tracing, which involves reaching as many people as possible who could have been potentially exposed to measles.
