USA: Norovirus Outbreaks at 3 Senior Citizen Centers in Florida
-------------------------------------------------
Outbreaks of norovirus infection have been reported at 2 senior
living centers, affecting at least 150 residents and workers, and is
suspected at a third. A fourth center reported an outbreak in
November 2002.
The 116-bed Tandem Health Care senior living center was the first in
Jacksonville to report cases of norovirus infection. More than 50
affected patients and workers have recovered, with no new cases, a
Tandem official said in a statement released on Tue 4 Feb 2003.
The illness has struck 61 residents and 42 workers at Cypress
Village, most of whom have recovered, officials said.
The virus has been confirmed at one other senior living center and is
suspected at another, said Rebecca Crouch, a Duval County Health
Department epidemiology nurse. She declined to name them.

Andorra: Independent Outbreaks of Gastroenteritis at Hotels and a School
--------------------------------------------------
Close to 300 students in one school and 173 tourists staying in 7
hotels in the Principality of Andorra have been affected by outbreaks
of gastroenteritis that, according to local authorities, are not
related to each other. Monica Codina, Minister of Health, stated that
the outbreak that has affected almost 300 children and 8 adults in
the San Ermengol school was detected last Monday [3 Feb 2003] but
that it may have started Wednesday or Thursday of the previous week.
The epidemiological surveys of a group of pre-school and grammar
school students that may also be affected have not been performed yet.
Also pending are the results of the microbiological tests of the food
and water served in the school dining room, but the minister has
indicated that the probable cause of the outbreak is the fact that
water pitchers were filled with hoses directly from the faucet. The
Minister stated that this outbreak of gastroenteritis is not related
to the one that affected 173 tourists, most of them young people on
holiday, who where staying in 7 hotels of the Principality. The
government is also investigating the cause of this outbreak and has
indicated that an anomaly in the system that supplies water to the
hotels was detected, requiring a process of chlorination, which has
not been carried out due to the heavy snowfall of the past few days.
[The suspicion that defective water supplies may be responsible for
all of these independent outbreaks suggests that the etiologic agent
may be an enterovirus, hepatitis A virus, or non-viral, rather than
one of the noroviruses associated with sudden-onset viral
gastroenteritis. Information on the outcome of diagnostic tests in
progress would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
