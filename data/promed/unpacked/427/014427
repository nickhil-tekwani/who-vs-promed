Finland will begin vaccinating minks on fur farms against COVID-19 after authorities granted temporary approval for an experimental vaccine, the country's regulator said on [Fri 1 Oct 2021].

The conditional usage permit "is valid until the end of December [2021], by which time the applicant has to provide further data," said senior inspector Liisa Kaartinen of the Finnish Food Authority, which oversees veterinary activities. Such conditional permits can be granted during a pandemic when no other vaccine is available.

Minks are bred for their fur and have been found at particular risk of contracting the novel coronavirus. "We have prepared about half a million doses now, which should be enough to vaccinate all animals twice," said Jussi Peura, research director at the Finnish Fur Breeders' Association, which developed the vaccine together with researchers from Helsinki University.

Because clinical trials have not yet been carried out, the jab cannot be distributed commercially and must be used in conjunction with strict procedures on Finland's 1000 fur farms to monitor and prevent the spread of the virus.

The vaccine approval applies only to Finland, where so far, no cases of the novel coronavirus have been identified among minks, and where transmission rates among humans have remained some of the lowest in the European Union.

The breeders' association believes its vaccine is the first to receive such approval in the EU. Neighbouring Russia said in March [2021] it had registered what it called the world's first animal vaccine against COVID-19, previously tested on dogs, cats, mink and foxes.

The mink is the only animal identified so far as being able to transmit COVID-19 to humans.

Denmark, previously Europe's largest exporter of mink pelts, saw its fur industry ravaged after a mutated strain of the virus spread through mink farms last November [2020]. All the country's some 15 million minks were subsequently culled.

[The information according to which SARS-CoV-2 has been apparently absent on Finland's mink farms is based upon monitoring and surveillance activities of the national Food Agency, since late 2020.

The initial policy was described in EFSA's scientific report "Monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection in mustelids" (approved 29 Jan 2021, doi: 10.2903/j.efsa.2021.6459; Finland: page 45). No pandemic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified, nor mink mutants in humans. Since then, the policy underwent a change, in line with the European Commission Decision 2021/788 which includes requirements for follow-up studies for mink and raccoon dog kennels with more than 500 adult breeding animals at the beginning of the breeding season. Follow-up studies of smaller holdings have been completed nationally in Finland.

Since 21 Jun 2021 and as of 11 Oct 2021, 3790 samples from 187 plants have been tested, all found negative (See, in Finnish, at https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/viljelijat/elaintenpito/elainten-terveys-ja-elaintaudit/elaintaudit/turkiselaimet/sars-cov-2-turkiselaimilla/sars-cov-2--seurantatutkimukset-turkistarhoilla-21.6.2021-alkaen/).

Following the mass culling of minks in Denmark and Netherlands during 2020 due to the identification of mink-to-human infections, the current world's 5 leading mink production countries are: China (20.7 million), Poland (5 million), USA (3.1 million), Finland (1.8 million) and Canada (1.7 million). A world map presenting these data as well as statistics of other 10 mink-breeding countries while addressing the mink variants of SARS-CoV-2, is available in the following paper: Devaux CA, Pinault L, Delerce J et al. (2021) Spread of Mink SARS-CoV-2 Variants in Humans: A Model of Sarbecovirus Interspecies Evolution. Front. Microbiol. 12:675528. doi: 10.3389/fmicb.2021.675528 (https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.675528/full).

Finland's mink population counts, according to the above paper, 1.8 million animals. The media report says that "half a million doses (of the experimental vaccine) should be enough to vaccinate all animals twice". Complementary details about the vaccination scheme will be, clarity-wise, helpful.
