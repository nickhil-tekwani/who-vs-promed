Professor Laura Kramer has drawn our attention to further inaccuracies in the ProMED-mail post: "Tick-borne encephalitis - USA (02): (NY) Powassan virus, alert 20130731.1856631." Professor Kramer has prepared the following statement to clarify the situation:

"The patient in Saratoga was confirmed by the Wadsworth Center to have been infected with Powassan virus and is recovering or has recovered. He did not die, as reported in the ProMED report from FOX news.

The case is posted on the USGS disease map. The current risk of infection in upstate New York is not known; however, there was one case in Albany County in 2004, and earlier studies demonstrated virus activity in ticks in the Capital region.

Powassan encephalitis remains rare but appears to be increasing. This may be attributable to the increasing _Ixodes scapularis_ tick population; however, improved diagnostics may also play a role. Deer tick virus (DTV) vector _Ix. scapularis_ populations in the region are high, as evidenced by the high rate of Lyme disease in the area.

Prototype Powassan virus cannot be distinguished from DTV serologically, but we hypothesize that the recent cases, i.e., since 2004, are DTV, since that virus was identified in 2 of the fatal cases in NY [state], where viral RNA was detected and sequenced; and in our field study, we only isolated DTV [the caveat being that not very many _Ix cookei_ (the vector of prototype POWV) were tested]. The infection prevalence in the ticks varies with location, as presented in the recent paper by Dupuis et al., 2013, from 0.2 to 6 infected ticks per 100 in the counties in the Hudson Valley that were part of the study.

Doctors should consider POWV in their differential diagnoses in encephalitis cases, especially when the patient has a history of tick bite or spends a lot of time outdoors. People are also encouraged to use personal protective measures to prevent tick bites."
