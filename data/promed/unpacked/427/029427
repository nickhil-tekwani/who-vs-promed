Measles in south-west Germany imported from Switzerland - a
preliminary outbreak description
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since January 2008, public health authorities in the state of
Baden-Wurttemberg, south-west Germany, have observed an increased
number of measles cases (16 cases in weeks 1-7 in 2008, compared to
3 cases in the same weeks in 2007) with epidemiological links to an
ongoing measles epidemic in Switzerland [1]. So far only unvaccinated
children, adolescents and young adults have been affected. Some cases
in this outbreak relate to German citizens with residence in
Switzerland or to Swiss citizens who commute to Germany. National
surveillance data therefore provide only a limited view of this
cross- border outbreak.

A German citizen in her 20s, resident in Basel, fell ill with measles
in week 3 of 2008 and returned to her parents' home in Karlsruhe,
Germany, for care. In week 5, her sister fell ill with laboratory-
confirmed measles and was admitted to a local hospital in week 6.

In the county of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald (southern Black Forest
region), 2 siblings of 10 and 13 years fell ill during week 4 of 2008
with laboratory-confirmed measles. One week earlier, at the occasion
of a family event in Switzerland, they had been in contact with
cousins who were harbouring a measles infection in the incubation
period. Genotyping of the measles virus isolates from both German
siblings showed D5 measles virus identical to the variant causing the
current outbreak in Switzerland. A 3rd 11-year-old sibling fell ill in week 6.

In week 6, a German citizen in his late 20s who had fallen ill with
laboratory-confirmed measles during a stay in the canton of Aargau,
Switzerland, was admitted to a hospital in Lorrach county, which
borders Switzerland. His spouse fell ill one week later.

In a school in Lorrach county, a 1st clinical measles case occurred
in week 4, followed by a 2nd clinical case one week later.
Subsequently, the school was closed for 13 days due to winter
holidays coinciding with the local carnival season. Immediately after
the school had reopened, further measles cases occurred. Initially,
notifications were only received with a delay of approximately 8 days
after the onset of clinical disease. It is unclear whether early
cases may have gone unnoticed.

As of 20 Feb 2008, 19 measles cases had been identified in children,
adolescents and young adults aged between 7 and 20 years attending
the school in Lorrach, including some students who commute from the
neighbouring Swiss city of Basel. The local public health service
informed all parents by leaflets. All physicians with private
practices in the county of Lorrach were informed by fax of the event.
Physicians were also informed about measles virus diagnostic kits
available from the public health service. Genotyping of the first 3
laboratory-confirmed cases for whom notifications were received after
the holidays is pending. The public was informed by media statements
issued by the county administration and the Baden-Wurttemberg State
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. Parents were advised to have
the vaccination status of their children checked by a physician and,
if necessary, completed.

Of note is that measles vaccine coverage in the affected region is
below the federal state average (94.1 percent for one and 83.9
percent for 2 doses among prospective school beginners in 2007). This
is due to a regional prevalence of groups with a critical attitude
towards immunisation.

Public health authorities expect the outbreak to continue.
Vaccination rates may improve county-wide but are unlikely to rise in
the population group opposed to vaccination in which the current
outbreak is occurring. Local health authorities in Germany and
Switzerland maintain cross-border contact and are co-operating in
outbreak investigation and prevention measures.

[Measles recognises no borders. Switzerland constitutes a potential
source of imported measles for other countries in Europe and
elsewhere. Importations have been reported in Germany, causing the
outbreak in Lower Bavaria described above, and in Denmark (one
sporadic case), in England (2 sporadic cases), and in the United
States (3 imported cases in 2007). In 2008 an importation from
Switzerland has been responsible for 12 cases in California and one
in Hawaii. In all situations the majority of cases are unimmunised or
partially immunised children and young adults. There is no evidence
that the measles virus component of the triple MMR vaccine is not
protective. - Mod.CP]
