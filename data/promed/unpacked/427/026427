Anthrax outbreak in Caprivi spreads to livestock
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Anthrax, which killed 11 wild animals in the eastern Caprivi 2 weeks ago,
has spread to livestock, the Ministry of Agriculture said yesterday. Dr
Frans Joubert, the Acting Deputy Director for Animal Disease Control in the
Ministry of Agriculture, told The Namibian that 9 cattle had died of the
disease since the beginning of the week. He said the deaths were recorded
in the same area where 7 elephants and 4 buffalo succumbed to the disease 2
weeks ago. Joubert said as a protective measure, the Ministry was now
vaccinating all cattle in the anthrax colony and the surrounding areas.
The colony covers the area east of Ngoma to Impalila Island.
Joubert said the affected area had also been cordoned off and cattle owners
were not allowed to move their livestock out of it. He said the vaccination
drive would also be extended to the rest of the Caprivi Region.
Anthrax is believed to have spread to the Caprivi Region from the Chobe
National Park in neighbouring Botswana.
Areas in the Caprivi that have been affected so far include Masikili,
Kasika, Kabulabula, Mhalasinte and Ivilivinzi.
The Ministry of Environment and Tourism has appealed to the residents in
the affected areas not to eat meat from the animals dying of anthrax, as
the disease is highly contagious.

Suspected Anthrax Outbreak Kills Cattle in Caprivi
-------------------------------------------------
Recent outbreaks of anthrax in the Chobe National Park in Botswana seem to
have spread to the eastern Caprivi, where hundreds of cattle appear to have
been infected by the highly contagious disease that has claimed dozens of
elephant and buffalo in Botswana. The infected cattle appear to have
contracted the disease from the grasslands that they share with herds of
free-roaming wild buffalo, elephant and other game.
The disease was detected after some cattle succumbed to anthrax at areas in
and around Kasika and at Kabulabula, where scores of livestock have died
after displaying anthrax symptoms, villagers in the affected areas told New
Era.
Prior to their deaths, some of the cattle were feverish, weak and they
staggered while others laboured in their breathing, according to those
interviewed by New Era.
Initially the Ministry of Environment and Tourism had given the Caprivi
Region a clean bill of health, but this appears not to be the case
following the recent discovery of carcasses of buffalo and elephant that
might have succumbed to anthrax.
Villagers apparently became suspicious of the disease when the milk
production of their cattle dropped significantly, while some milk and even
the urine of some of the cattle appeared crimson in colour.
Veterinary officials at Katima Mulilo were not immediately available to
confirm what appears to be an anthrax outbreak at Kasika and at Kabulabula.
Plans are already afoot to vaccinate tens of thousands of cattle from the
deadly disease that is caused by a virulent bacterium called [_Bacillus
anthracis_].
Some villagers also said veterinary officials were aware of the outbreak,
and this could be one of the reasons why they plan a massive inoculation
exercise. Vets are also expected to visit the affected villages, possibly
by today, when the large-scale vaccination exercise is expected to take
place until the end of this month.
Though uncommon among humans, the disease can also infect human beings who
feast on infected carcasses.

[Let us hope that the wet season comes early, which in previous years has
stopped the spread of this disease. In the meanwhile the only protection
that can be provided to local livestock is vaccination. The disease is no
longer "suspected." - Mod.MHJ]
