Brazil's government said on [Fri 18 Jun 2021] that 82 people connected with the Copa America soccer tournament had contracted COVID-19, an increase of 16 infections from the previous day [Thu 17 Jun 2021].

Brazil's health ministry said in a statement that 6926 tests were conducted, with 37 players and staffers of the 10 tournament teams infected plus 45 workers. All 4 host cities of the tournament, Rio de Janeiro, Brasilia, Cuiaba and Goiania, have cases relating to the tournament.

Brazil stepped in as an emergency host despite the country having the 2nd highest number of recorded deaths from the coronavirus in the world, nearing 500 000.

Half of the teams playing in the Copa America have reported COVID-19 cases -- Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and Chile.

[CONMEBOL Copa America (CONMEBOL America Cup), known until 1975 as the South American Football Championship (Campeonato Sudamericano de Futbol in Spanish and Copa Sul-Americana de Futebol in Portuguese), is the main men's football tournament contested among national teams from CONMEBOL. It is the oldest still-running international football competition, as well as the 3rd most watched in the world. The competition determines the champions of South America. Since the 1990s, teams from North America and Asia have also been invited to participate.

[2] Canine coronavirus
Date: Sun 20 Jun 2021

When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, Professor Gregory Gray at Duke University's Global Health Institute tasked a graduate student at his lab with developing a pan-species coronavirus test in order to help prevent the next catastrophe.

The idea was to deploy the tool, once its accuracy was validated, to look back at test samples from human patients in order to search for signs of coronaviruses that might have begun to cross over from animals.

Gray and his colleague's findings, released [Thu17 Jun 2021] in Clinical Infectious Diseases, showed a canine coronavirus was present in a group of mostly children patients admitted to hospital for pneumonia in Malaysia in 2017 and 2018.

The team suspect the dog virus caused their illness, as opposed to merely being present in the patients' airways -- but can't conclusively prove it. Given the genetic makeup of the virus it's unlikely that it is currently circulating between humans.

"What we're advocating for... is more application of pan-species diagnostics to look for five different viral families we think are the most problematic in causing epidemics in humans," Gray told AFP.

Coronaviruses were understudied for many years, as they were mainly associated with common colds. That changed after the SARS and MERS outbreaks of 2002 and 2012, which originated in civets and camels, respectively.

Most scientists believe the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID also has a zoonotic origin.

Gray asked Lishan Xiu, a Chinese PhD student-scholar, to make a pan-species coronavirus test, which he did by finding where the genetic sequences of the various members of this family aligned.

They used this tool on nasal swab tests taken from pneumonia patients from the hospital in Sarawak, Malaysia, and found that eight of 301 samples appeared to have a canine virus.

The finding was surprising, and to confirm it, they teamed up with leading virologist Anastasia Vlasova at Ohio State University, who was able to grow more of the virus and sequence its entire genome. From that, they determined the virus, which they called CCoV-HuPn-2018, was mainly canine in origin but it also had feline and swine components.

It showed some mutations that were consistent with adapting to transmission among humans, but it's not known how long this evolution might take -- maybe decades, maybe never, said Gray.

All of the patients recovered from their pneumonia and were sent home. "But getting admitted for pneumonia in general means you're pretty sick, the clinician is worried about you," added Gray.

The fact that the team was able to detect canine virus in humans in what was essentially a small pilot study, together with recent similar findings from other research groups, could point to a much larger problem, he emphasized.

"We are missing the boat here," said Gray. "If we set up surveillance of pig workers, poultry workers, cattle workers, we're going to be amazed at what their immune systems are being challenged with. That doesn't mean that they're going to be the match that lights the next pandemic, but they would be a good resource to study."

[Ref. Vlasova AN, Diaz A, Damtie D, et al. Novel Canine Coronavirus Isolated from a Hospitalized Pneumonia Patient, East Malaysia, Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2021; ciab456, https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab456

Abstract
--------
Background
"During the validation of a highly sensitive pan-species coronavirus (CoV) semi-nested RT-PCR assay, we found canine CoV (CCoV) RNA in nasopharyngeal swabs from 8 (2.5%) of 301 patients hospitalized with pneumonia during 2017-18 in Sarawak, Malaysia. Most patients were children living in rural areas with frequent exposure to domesticated animals and wildlife.

Methods
"Specimens were further studied with universal and species-specific CoV and CCoV one-step RT-PCR assays, and viral isolation was performed in A72 canine cells. Complete genome sequencing was conducted using Sanger method.

Results
"Two of 8 specimens contained sufficient amounts of CCoVs as confirmed by less-sensitive single-step RT-PCR assays, and one specimen demonstrated cytopathic effects (CPE) in A72 cells. Complete genome sequencing of the virus causing CPE identified it as a novel canine-feline recombinant alphacoronavirus (genotype II) that we named CCoV-HuPn-2018. Most of CCoV-HuPn-2018 genome is more closely related to a CCoV TN-449, while its S gene shared significantly higher sequence identity with CCoV-UCD-1 (S1 domain) and a feline CoV WSU 79-1683 (S2 domain). CCoV-HuPn-2018 is unique for a 36 nt (12-aa) deletion in the N protein and the presence of full-length and truncated 7b non-structural protein which may have clinical relevance.

Conclusions
"This is the first report of a novel canine-feline recombinant alphacoronavirus isolated from a human pneumonia patient. If confirmed as a pathogen, it may represent the 8th unique coronavirus known to cause disease in humans. Our findings underscore the public health threat of animal CoVs and a need to conduct better surveillance for them."

This "canine coronavirus" is called CCoV-HuPn-2018. It's different from SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that caused the COVID-19 pandemic.

If experts confirm CCoV-HuPn-2018 as a pathogen, it will be the 8th known coronavirus that can cause infection in humans. But the researchers say there's no current threat to people, and there's no proof that it can spread from one person to another.

In further studies after its discovery, researchers found that CCoV-HuPn-2018 was able to spread to humans because of a deletion in its genome. The specific deletion isn't usually found in canine coronaviruses. Instead, it's in human versions, similar to the mutation in SARS and SARS-CoV-2.

[B] Peru: Lambda variant

https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lambda-COVID-19-strain-who-finds-new-variant-of-interest-in-south-america-101623989602402.html


The World Health Organization (WHO) announced earlier this week that 'Lambda', a new variant of interest of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), has been found in Peru. The new COVID-19 variant, which was first detected in August last year [2020], accounts for around 81% of the cases reported since April [2021] in the country, according to WHO. Moreover, the Lambda COVID-19 variant is now prevalent in as many as 29 countries, most notably in South America where it is believed to have originated.

According to a report by Xinhua news agency citing World Health Organization officials, the Lambda COVID-19 variant has been dubbed a global 'variant of interest' due to its elevated presence in South America.

The variant was also reported in countries like Chile, where it accounts for 32% of all submitted sequences in the preceding 60 days. The Lambda variant was also reported in neighbouring countries in South America, such as Argentina and Ecuador. WHO suspects mutations present in the Lambda COVID-19 variant might show increased transmission and resistance to antibodies.

Meanwhile, the Delta COVID-19 variant, first identified in India, was classified as a "variant of concern" by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) earlier this week. Previously, the Delhi COVID-19 strain was only considered a "variant of interest" by the US CDC, but its status was changed to a "variant of concern" after assessing the Delta variant's high transmissibility, among other factors. Along with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of COVID-19, a few other variants circulating in the United States have also been classified as 'variants of concern', a CDC statement published on [Tue 15 Jun 2021]. These include the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.427 (Epsilon), and B.1.429 (Epsilon) COVID-19 variants.

The Delta variant, which was dubbed a 'variant of concern' by the World Health Organization (WHO) on [10 May 2021], accounts for around 9.9% of all COVID-19 cases in the United States, the CDC estimates. However, to date, no variants of high consequence have been identified in the country, the public health body explained in its statement.

[C] Paraguay and other South American countries
Date: Fri 18 Jun 2021

https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/jun/18/COVID-south-america-paraguay-argentina-peru


Strained and underfunded health systems, economics and misinformation have all led to a surge in deaths. The cold, tired and desperate relatives camped outside the Barrio Obrero general hospital in Asunción don't need charts or datasets to confirm what they can see with their own eyes.

As Paraguay records the world's highest daily proportion of COVID deaths, the huddled families wait for news of their loved ones - and for the sudden requests for medicine and supplies that the country's chronically underfunded health system cannot provide.

"There's really so little support from the government - it's a disaster," said J.O., whose father was languishing in a chair instead of a bed. "They should have prepared for all this from the start of the pandemic."

As she spoke, 2 women collapsed on a sofa in the hospital's entrance, their uncontrollable tears announcing the death of Paraguay's most recent coronavirus victim.

N.B., who stood nearby, was relieved to be able to drop the brave face she had just put on for her mother, who lay intubated in hospital a day after losing her husband to COVID. "I couldn't let my mom see me in the state I was in," said N.B.. Still, she added, at least her mother had got a bed.

"We needed intensive care yesterday for my dad and there wasn't any. There just isn't any."

On [Wed 16 Jun 2021], Paraguay registered 18.09 deaths per million, compared with 2.71 in India, 2.2 in South Africa, 1.01 in the US, and 0.14 in the UK.

And as the US and Europe begin to emerge from the pandemic, discard their masks and ponder how best to spend the recovery funds, the crisis most evident in Paraguay is playing out across much of South America.

India may have commanded much of the world's attention over recent weeks, but Paraguay, Suriname, Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia, Brazil and Peru are suffering - in that order - a silent decimation by COVID unlike that anywhere else in the world. Even in 7th-placed Peru, the number of deaths per million stands at 9.12 - more than 3 times the figure in India.

In the early months of the pandemic, Paraguay and nearby Uruguay were praised as Latin America's standout success stories in COVID management. But since March [2021] the 2 countries have seen an explosion of the disease, largely attributed to the aggressive Brazilian variant that has torn through much of South America, and to decreased compliance with social distancing measures.

In Uruguay, not even one of Latin America's quickest vaccination programmes has been able to contain the spread. Paraguay, meanwhile, has faced the continuing emergency under the strain of entrenched poverty, a historically underfunded health system, and with many questions over government corruption. Anger and frustration prompted widespread street protests earlier this year [2021] and a manslaughter case against the government has been opened by the public prosecutor's office.

Argentina was also seen as a model, with low case numbers at the start of the pandemic when the government introduced strong restrictions that were respected by the public. But that scenario has changed drastically. COVID has become Argentina's main killer, far outstripping heart disease and cancer and claiming an average of 528 deaths a day over the past 2 weeks.

Vanina Edul, an ICU doctor in Buenos Aires, says the lack of the kind of scenes witnessed in some countries during the first wave of the pandemic is misleading: "What generates the notion of sanitary collapse is when people die in their homes or on the street, but in Argentina people are dying behind closed doors in COVID wards so COVID deaths remain invisible and almost unreal."

Claudio Belocoppitt, the head of the Argentinian Health Union, (UAS), which represents private health insurance firms, argues that the country's chronic social and economic problems play a part in the high COVID death rate. "Our poverty markers have grown hugely in the last decade, our inflation rate is one of the highest in the world, so why should we be expected to suddenly become geniuses at managing a calamity like this?" he asks.

Tensions between the ruling progressive Peronists, who have stood by the science but allowed their traditional populist reflexes to influence decisions, and the pro business Together for Change opposition, with its denialist tendencies, have not helped.

Earlier this week, the government announced an overhaul of the country's health system to integrate public and private care providers - a decision Belocoppitt likens to "reorganising your army in the middle of a war".

And yet Argentinians remain optimistic - and largely unaware of the high death rate - as the news is drowned out by the country's complex political wrangling.

Argentina's vaccination programme is in full swing and the vaccination menu has diversified with Sputnik, Sinopharm and AstraZeneca, the main vaccines administered. Almost 40% of the population has got at least one jab and nearly 8% 2 jabs so far.

While underinvestment, economics, new variants and slow vaccination programmes bear responsibility for much of the region's current crisis, so do many of its politicians. And no leader on the continent faces a charge sheet quite as damning as that of Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil, about to reach the awful landmark of 500 000 deaths, has been led by a president who dismissed the coronavirus as a "little flu", who resisted containment strategies, and who was fined last weekend for failing to wear a mask at a biker rally in Sao Paulo. He is now being investigated by a congressional inquiry over his calamitous response to the public health emergency.

Those involved in the COVID response - including representatives of pharmaceutical companies - have told the inquiry that the Bolsonaro administration dismissed offers to acquire the vaccine last year [2020]. The country has so far managed to immunise just 11.4% of its 212 million citizens.

Worse still, acceptance of the vaccine has also been stymied by Bolsonaro's vehemently anti-science posturing.

"The biggest issue in Brazil - and one that's having a terrible effect on vaccine take-up - is the denialism in politics," said Chrystina Barros, a member of the group fighting COVID-19 at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. "We have a denialist president whose speech and behaviour run contrary to medical advice - and which are influencing people against getting the vaccine. It's a perfect storm."

With average daily deaths of 2000, Brazil is becoming increasingly isolated worldwide. Several nations - including its neighbour Argentina - are restricting entry to Brazilian passengers, and the country has been the subject of international opprobrium.

"If Brazil doesn't take the pandemic seriously, it will continue to affect the entire neighbourhood there and beyond," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general at the World Health Organization, said at the end of March [2021]. "It's not just about Brazil."

Political upheaval - not to mention decades of underinvestment in public healthcare - has also taken its toll in neighbouring Peru. H.A., a 51-year-old nutritionist who worked in a clinic for the elderly in central Lima, died a fortnight after being diagnosed with COVID. He left behind 3 children aged 18, 16 and 10.

"He died because of the health system's inefficiency," said his younger sister, P.A. "Then the disease consumed him." Despite making his social security payments, H.A. spent 10 days in intensive care in a hospital that lacked the staff needed to deal with complicated cases. "My brother needed 24-hour attention with specialists and ICU equipment that they couldn't give him," said P.A.

She, like tens of thousands of bereaved Peruvians, is furious at the successive governments that have invested a paltry portion of GDP in the healthcare system - less than half what neighbouring countries put into public health - despite 2 decades of strong economic growth.

Days before a deeply divisive 2nd round ballot between 2 candidates at opposite ends of the political spectrum, a government review confirmed what Peruvians had long suspected: the true number of COVID-19 deaths in the country was 180 764 - almost triple the official death toll of 69 342. The belated revision made Peru the country with the highest death rate per capita in the world.

Peru may have imposed one of the earliest and strictest lockdowns in Latin America back in March [2020], but high labour informality, overcrowded households and even shopping habits meant the measures failed to curtail infections.

The vaccine rollout has been slow and the 2nd wave of the virus was worse than the first, forcing Peru into another severe lockdown after a surge in infections that pushed hospitals to the edge of the collapse. Progress has also been scuppered by the political turmoil which saw 3 presidents in a week last year [2020], and the situation wasn't helped by the revelation in February [2021] that former leader Martin Vizcarra and nearly 500 others had been vaccinated in secret.

A caretaker government steered the vaccination drive back on track and about 2m Peruvians - 7% of the population - have now been fully vaccinated.

The death rate, which peaked in April [2021], has slowly decreased but the grief and anger remain.

"The strange thing about this pandemic is that all the death has not sunk in," said P.A. "Sometimes, I think we believe it's all a bad dream."

J.O. sees little prospect of a swift end to the nightmare as she waits for word on her father and wonders whether he'll be able to swap his chair for a bed. "This is how it is," she said amid the cold and the tears and the embraces outside the Barrio Obrero general hospital. "It's like this here every day. Every day."

[4] Israel school related outbreak
Date: Sat 19 Jun 2021
Source: Israel Hayom [in Hebrew, trans. Mod.AS, edited]
https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/local/article/2370803/


Following an increase in the number of confirmed cases in students at the "Asif" school in Modi'in, the municipality decided to return the mask wearing obligation in the city's educational institutions.

The Modi'in municipality updated yesterday [Fri 18 Jun 2021] that 11 6th-grade students at the school were infected by COVID. Today [Sat 19 Jun 2021] their number has been updated, rising to 15. Also, 2 teachers in the city were found positive for the virus, and 2 family members of students were confirmed infected.

At the same time, 45 children have been confirmed to be infected in Binyamina; the Ministry of Health is examining whether there is a connection to a family that recently returned from abroad, suspecting the involvement of the Indian COVID-19 variant.

The outbreak was discovered thanks to an extensive sampling operation, which began with the 1st sick child at the Cramim school in Binyamina. Following the exposure, more students in different age groups at the school were examined and 9 additional confirmed infected; all but one of whom were symptomatic.

As a result, the sampling was extended to additional schools and this morning [19 Jun 2021] another 35 verified infected - some from the Cramim School and the others from Amirim School. The new cases are under investigation by the Hadera Health Bureau.

All the samples were sent to sequencing at Israel's National Center for Genomic Technologies. As mentioned, there is a preliminary suspicion that the Indian variant is involved.

In a press release, the Ministry of Health calls on the residents of Binyamina to be tested, in order to maintain public health and prevent the spread of the virus in the locality. The Ministry also calls on those put under isolation to fully perform the isolation according to the procedures in general, and among returnees from abroad in particular.

[From Mod.AS: "On 17 June 2021, the Director of Public Health Services, Ministry of Health, Jerusalem published a circular No 496167321 (In Hebrew), titled "Epidemiological Opinion: Extending the Validity of the 'Special Powers Act Confronting the New Corona Virus (Temporary Order), 2020', (hereinafter the Act) and Extension of an Emergency Situation According to the Act". (<tinyurl.com/j4f8z6nb>)

"The (11 pages) document included, among others, a description of a recent event as follows:

"A 6th-grade girl from the city of Modi'in who returned with her parents from abroad, broke isolation and returned to school immediately when back home, later diagnosed as a COVID-19 patient. As of today [Thu 17 Jun 2021], at least 12 out of about 100 contacts of hers have been diagnosed ill (of which 11 children) . Her samples have been highly suspected by the lab as infected by the Indian variant. Final results are still pending. Following the illness, about 360 additional (pupils, teachers, parents of children, etc.) were sampled and about 90 more contacts have been placed in isolation.

"The actual dimensions of the event will become established only during the coming weeks; hopefully, the early intervention, including rapid investigation, extensive sampling and isolation of contacts may lead to a success in reducing the scope of the event.

"This event includes morbidity introduced from abroad, the involvement of a mutant variant with a particularly high infectious potential, non-compliance with isolation requirements, and the rapid spread of morbidity within a group of unvaccinated children which is not vaccinable at the current stage. It clearly illustrates the close connection between the threats outside the borders of the State of Israel and the risk that a single point event may violate the relaxed morbidity, achieved with great effort and a heavy toll paid".

Several take away points here:

1st and foremost is the weaknesses in honor systems that are used upon opening up of restrictions. The index case's family did not follow the requested isolation period and the unvaccinated child returned to school during the incubation period. (Israel's isolation criteria and pre-requisites available at https://www.gov.il/en/departments/guides/corona-quarantine?chapterIndex=9)

2nd, while Israel has succeeded in vaccinating approximately 80% of the adult population and approximately 60% of all citizens https://www.businessinsider.com/israel-vaccinated-most-adults-covid-herd-immunity-2021-6) (56.9% https://bit.ly/3vMlVh88 and 59% https://ourworldindata.org/COVID-vaccinations?country=OWID_WRL~ISR~USA~IND).

Up until recently the focus was on age 16 years and older there remain pockets of unvaccinated. Vaccination recommendations for ages 12-16 are available at https://govextra.gov.il/ministry-of-health/COVID19-vaccine/en-COVID19-vaccines-for-children/ and vaccine is available, there are still the primary and pre-school-aged children who are not being vaccinated as yet. This creates significant "pockets" of susceptibles who are at risk of infection and serve as transmitters. (see section [2] below for more on this topic).

According to a recent Israeli Ministry of Health press release "Nevertheless, since the infection rate in Israel is currently very low, it was recommended that people from high-risk groups be vaccinated, including teenagers who are at high-risk for serious coronavirus illness, teenagers who live with family members who are at high-risk for serious coronavirus illness, as well as for teenagers in families who plan to travel abroad." Press release on vaccination of teenagers 12-16 years of age. https://www.gov.il/en/departments/news/02062021-01).

Other pockets of susceptibles exist in Israel as well and the above outbreak highlights what can happen when the virus is introduced into a pocket of unvaccinated susceptibles.

3rd, travel remains a high risk endeavor for disease transmission. Especially travelling with unvaccinated individuals (including children). The location of travel was not given in the reports we've seen thus far but there are very few countries in the world that have not reported cases. https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-students-ordered-to-wear-masks-in-central-israel-due-to-local-COVID-outbreak-1.9922073, https://www.jpost.com/health-science/is-israel-on-the-verge-of-a-new-COVID-19-outbreak-671558 (no mention of importation). - Mod.MPP]

[5] UK concern re: shifting age distribution
Date: Sun 20 Jun 2021
Source: The Guardian [edited]
https://www.theguardian.com/society/2021/jun/20/under-18s-could-be-reservoirs-for-virus-when-all-adults-are-jabbed-expert-warns


The drive to vaccinate all adults over the age of 18 in the UK could lead to the concentration of COVID-19 cases in schoolchildren, a leading British virologist has warned. Under-18s would then become reservoirs in which new variants of the virus could arise, said Julian Tang, of Leicester University.

Tang was speaking as Public Health England revealed a 79% rise in one week in cases of the Delta variant of COVID, 1st identified in India. A race is now on between the vaccination programme and the emergence of a 3rd wave of the virus, say scientists.

Many believe there are grounds for cautious optimism that the vaccine will hold back hospitalisations and deaths in the wake of rising case numbers triggered by last month's [May 2021] partial release of lockdown measures, as well as the arrival of the Delta variant. However, Tang sounded a note of caution. Most recent data indicates that the main focus of infections was now in the under-30s who have not yet been extensively vaccinated, he said. "The predominance of the Delta variant over the previous Alpha variant now confirms an increased transmissibility over this earlier variant - and a much higher transmissibility over the original virus," he added.

As the COVID-19 vaccination programme progressed into younger and younger age groups, this process would drive the virus into the under-18s, who are not yet scheduled to be vaccinated. "As a result, the virus will concentrate in school-age populations, which will eventually become a reservoir and driver of any ensuing Delta variant epidemic, as well as being a hotspot in which new mutations may arise," Tang said.

Such developments would increase pressure on the government to give the go-ahead to COVID vaccination programmes for children and teenagers, although Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, said last week [w/e 20 Jun 2021] she understood the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation would not be recommending such a move in the short term.

The move to vaccinate children has been criticised by global health leaders. They point out that in low and lower-middle income countries, COVID-19 vaccine supplies have been so poor that healthcare workers are not being immunised while hospitals are being inundated with the sick and dying. They are calling for these nations to be prioritised for vaccination programmes.

The government has also stressed its commitment to removing the last lockdown measures on [Sat 19 Jul 2021] - action that was postponed last week for 4 weeks to try to hold back the rising number of cases. Such a move would lift the final restrictions on social life in the UK, including holiday home sharing, nightclubbing and attending concerts. "Crowd events are providers of a sense of wellbeing for a lot of people," psychologist Professor John Drury, of Sussex University, told the Observer. "Individuals who don't enjoy being in large crowds might not care about the last restrictions that are still being maintained but if major events continue to be blocked or restricted by the government that could be a hammer blow for a lot of individuals."

Ivo Vlaev, professor of behavioural science at Warwick University, added that if the government was forced to reintroduce COVID-19 restrictions in future in response to a new wave of infections it should take care to avoid taking an intermittent, "on-off" approach. "If some of the restrictions are reintroduced, it must be clear what the changes are and how people should act," Vlaev said. "The advice should be brief and to the point, as there is some evidence that brief messages are more effective at convincing people to change their behaviour. Information about the outbreak and the quarantine protocols also needs to be clear and consistent, and not open to interpretation."

[In the USA, as of 10 Jun 2021, overall, there have been 4 008 572 total child COVID-19 cases reported, and children represented 14.1% (4 008 572/28 338 538) of all cases. Overall rate: 5326 cases per 100 000 children in the population (American Academy of Pediatrics - AAP -https://services.aap.org/en/pages/2019-novel-coronavirus-COVID-19-infections/children-and-COVID-19-state-level-data-report/) and in the week ending 10 Jun 2021, they represented 19% of newly reported cases. In a 3 May 2021 NPR (National Public Radio) report they cited statistics from the AAP showing children accounted for 22% of the newly reported cases during the previous week, while a year ago (May 2020) they represented approximately 3% (https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/05/03/993141036/children-now-account-for-22-of-new-u-s-COVID-cases-why-is-that).

This age distribution shift is consistent with an age distribution shift in the susceptible population, with the older population at high risk if severe disease accepting vaccination, leaving the proportion of susceptibles in younger age groups higher. Translating this, it's not that there are increases in actual case numbers in the childhood population, just that they represent a larger proportion of the cases with the older population protected by the vaccines.

Hence, the concern voiced in the above media report is a valid observational concern, especially when the new school year begins in the fall. But if teachers and other school employees are vaccinated, and the parents are vaccinated, and the unvaccinated age groups are wearing masks in the indoor setting, it should result in small manageable clusters or isolated cases. But if adult employees in the schools and the parents are not vaccinated, and the children are unmasked in the school, the threat of larger outbreaks remains. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, 7 countries including India (53 009), Brazil (44 178), Colombia (27 818), Indonesia (13 737), Russia (17 611), South Africa (13 155), and Argentina (10 395), have reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 6425 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 18 Jun 2021 to late 19 Jun 2021). A total of 41 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 16 of the 41 countries are from the European region, 7 are from the Americas region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 4 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 0.54%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 24.9%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show 23.1% decrease in daily reported cases and 21.3% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 250 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 179.25 million cumulative reported cases and over 3.88 million reported deaths - Mod.UBA
