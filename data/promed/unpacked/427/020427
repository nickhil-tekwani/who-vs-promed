[1] Cardiovascular risks post-COVID
Date: Wed 2 Mar 2022

An analysis of data from nearly 154 000 US veterans with SARS-CoV-2 infection provides a grim preliminary answer to the question: What are COVID-19's long-term cardiovascular outcomes? The study, published in Nature Medicine by researchers at the Veterans Affairs (VA) St Louis Health Care System, found that in the year after recovering from the illness's acute phase, patients had increased risks of an array of cardiovascular problems, including abnormal heart rhythms, heart muscle inflammation, blood clots, strokes, myocardial infarction, and heart failure (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-01689-3). What's more, the heightened risks were evident even among those who weren't hospitalized with acute COVID-19.

At the beginning of the pandemic, the research team resolved to identify and address important knowledge gaps around COVID-19, study senior author Ziyad Al-Aly, MD, told JAMA in an email. "At that time, none of us knew anything about long COVID," noted Al-Aly, who is chief of research and development at the VA St Louis Health Care System and a clinical epidemiologist at Washington University in St Louis. "Over several weeks, we started hearing about patients who were not fully recovering and had lingering issues including heart problems." These patients -- who call themselves long haulers -- inspired the team to study long COVID, also known as post-COVID conditions.

In a report published in Nature last April [2021], the researchers demonstrated that people with long COVID can have sequelae in several organ systems, including cardiovascular disorders (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03553-9). With the current study, they set out to gain a deeper understanding of COVID-19's long-term cardiovascular consequences.

The new analysis in Nature Medicine examined a comprehensive, prespecified set of cardiovascular outcomes among patients in the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA) system who survived the first 30 days of COVID-19. The researchers estimated the risks and excess burden of cardiovascular outcomes per 1000 persons 12 months after COVID-19 using electronic medical record data from 3 large cohorts:

- 153 760 patients who used VHA services in 2019 and had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result between 1 Mar 2020 and 15 Jan 2021
- 5 637 647 patients with no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection who used VHA services in 2019 -- the contemporary control group
- 5 859 411 prepandemic patients who used VHA services in 2017 -- the historical control group

The cohorts largely comprised older White male patients. The COVID-19 cohort, which averaged 61 years old, included 89% males and about 71% White individuals. But because the study was large, it also included almost 17 000 female patients; about 37 000 Black patients; and almost 8000 Latino, Asian, American Indian, Native Hawaiian, and patients of other races with COVID-19.

Patients with COVID-19 were at increased risk of a broad range of cardiovascular disorders, including cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure, and thromboembolic disease.

At the 12-month mark, compared with the contemporary control group, for every 1000 people, COVID-19 was associated with an extra:

- 45.29 incidents of any prespecified cardiovascular outcome
- 23.48 incidents of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality
- 19.86 incidents of dysrhythmias, including 10.74 incidents of atrial fibrillation
- 12.72 incidents of other cardiovascular disorders including 11.61 incidents of heart failure and 3.56 incidents of nonischemic cardiomyopathy
- 9.88 incidents of thromboembolic disorders, including 5.47 incidents of pulmonary embolism and 4.18 incidents of deep vein thrombosis
- 7.28 incidents of ischemic heart disease, including 5.35 incidents of acute coronary disease, 2.91 incidents of myocardial infarction, and 2.5 incidents of angina
- 5.48 incidents of cerebrovascular disorders, including 4.03 incidents of stroke
- 1.23 incidents of inflammatory disease of the heart or pericardium, including 0.98 incidents of pericarditis and 0.31 incidents of myocarditis

Patients with more severe disease -- determined by whether they recuperated at home, were hospitalized, or were admitted to the intensive care unit -- had higher risks. But the risks were evident even among those who were not hospitalized with COVID-19. Other subgroup analysis found increased risks regardless of age, race, sex, obesity, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, hyperlipidemia, and preexisting cardiovascular disease.

The study's overall findings were consistent when outcomes were compared between patients with COVID-19 and the control group of prepandemic patients.

"In our work, we show serious long-term cardiovascular disease consequences of COVID-19," Al-Aly wrote. "Most of these are lifelong conditions that will affect people for a lifetime and may impact their quality of life and other health outcomes. The risks reported in our paper may appear small but given the large number of people with COVID-19 in the United States and globally, these numbers will likely translate into millions of people with heart disease in the United States and many more around the world. We need to realize this now and make sure we are prepared and ready to address the needs of these patients."

[2] New Zealand
Date: Thu 3 Mar 2022

https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/03/world/australia/new-zealand-covid-omicron.html


For much of the past 2 years, COVID-19 was a phantom presence in New Zealand, a plague experienced mostly through news reports from faraway lands. Now, suddenly, it has become a highly personal threat.

New Zealand is being walloped by a major outbreak of the omicron variant, with the virus spreading at what may be the fastest rate in the world. On Thursday [3 Mar 2022], the country reported 23 194 new cases, a once unthinkable number in a small island nation of about 5 million people where the record daily case count before the current wave was in the low hundreds.

The explosion in cases has come as the government, under political pressure, loosened its strict regulations meant to prevent the spread of the virus, and as the highly transmissible omicron reduced the effectiveness of the controls that remained. That has filled many New Zealanders with anxiety as they learn to live with the pandemic-related risk that the rest of the world has grappled with since early 2020.

"For the vast majority of the pandemic, most New Zealanders didn't know anyone who had COVID-19. That's changing massively now," said Siouxsie Wiles, a microbiologist at the University of Auckland. "This is the 1st time most New Zealanders are dealing with COVID-19 in their own homes."

While the ever-growing case numbers may be unsettling, New Zealand was perhaps as well positioned as it could have been for its deferred reckoning with the virus. Earlier in the pandemic, before the population was widely vaccinated, the country kept infections and deaths very low through a stringent quarantine system for incoming travelers, lockdowns during outbreaks and significant isolation periods for those who tested positive or were close contacts. Caseloads often stood at zero, and life for long periods resembled a time before the pandemic. Even after New Zealand began to shift away from a "COVID zero" strategy following the emergence of the delta variant, case numbers remained relatively small.

By the time of the arrival of the omicron variant -- which is more contagious but often produces milder symptoms -- the country was well protected. Ninety-five percent of New Zealanders over age 12 have been vaccinated, and 57% have had a booster shot. With this combination of strict measures and widespread inoculation, the country has reported just 56 virus deaths throughout the pandemic -- by far the lowest rate of any major democracy.

But New Zealand's initial caution toward the virus became politically untenable this year [2022] as citizens living overseas protested limits on their return and business advocates called for fewer restrictions. In response, the government weakened its pandemic controls. Last week, it removed many self-isolation requirements, and on Monday [28 Feb 2022] it announced that vaccinated New Zealanders could freely enter the country without isolating or quarantining. New Zealand remains closed to international tourists.

With the virus now spreading rapidly, the country has been forced to undergo a "big psychological shift," said Michael Baker, an epidemiologist at the University of Otago in Dunedin. While the approach to managing the virus was once one of "collective protection," Dr. Baker said, it is now one of "much more individual and family responsibility."

The government has tried to prepare the public for this shift by warning that New Zealanders' experience of the virus would change. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern noted last week that "very soon we will all know people who have COVID-19 or we will potentially get it ourselves."

Modelers estimate that each omicron-positive New Zealander is infecting an average of 4.64 other people -- the highest rate among 180 countries analyzed. Experts believe that half the country could be infected within 3 months.

Major outbreaks have also occurred in other countries, like Australia, that loosened strict pandemic measures. Australia's spike, however, occurred during the Southern Hemisphere summer, which Dr. Baker said significantly slowed the virus's spread.

New Zealand's outbreak, by contrast, has come as workplaces settled into the business year and students headed back to school and college. Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand's director-general of health, has called it a "nationwide superspreader event."

By Tuesday [1 Mar 2022], there were over 3200 active cases of COVID-19 in Dunedin, with many hundreds more people self-isolating as household contacts. Students are anxious about the virus's spread and frustrated with the individual pressure they feel about managing it, Ms. Lama said.

Elsewhere in the country, anger over the government's COVID-19 response produced a different kind of superspreader event. In Wellington, the capital, hundreds of demonstrators opposed to vaccine mandates occupied the grounds surrounding Parliament in an occasionally violent protest that lasted for over 3 weeks. After serious clashes between the police and demonstrators, multiple officers began reporting COVID-19 infections. Partly because of the health risk, officers battled protesters to clear the occupation on Wednesday [2 Mar 2022].

[It is not surprising that there is an outbreak in New Zealand with the lifting of restrictions that were in place earlier in the pandemic, such as stringent quarantine system for incoming travelers, lockdowns during outbreaks and significant isolation periods for those who tested positive or were close contacts. Even though the population is highly vaccinated, omicron is highly infectious. The virus has infected an average of 4.64 contacts there -- the highest rate among 180 countries analyzed. - Mod.LK]

Ref: Suelen H. Qassim, Hiam Chemaitelly, Houssein Ayoub, et al. Effects of BA.1/BA.2 subvariant, vaccination, and prior infection on infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2 omicron infections. medRxiv 2022.03.02.22271771; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.03.02.22271771

Abstract
--------
Background: Qatar experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 omicron (B.1.1.529) wave that started on 19 Dec 2021 and peaked in mid-January, 2022. We investigated effects of omicron subvariant (BA.1 and BA.2), previous vaccination, and prior infection on infectiousness of omicron infections, between 23 Dec 2021 and 20 Feb 2022.

Methods: Univariable and multivariable regression analyses were conducted to estimate the association between the RT-qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR tests (a proxy for SARS-CoV-2 infectiousness) and each of the omicron subvariants, mRNA vaccination, prior infection, reason for RT-qPCR testing, calendar week of RT-qPCR testing (to account for phases of the rapidly evolving omicron wave), and demographic factors.

Results: Compared to BA.1, BA.2 was associated with 3.53 fewer cycles (95% CI: 3.46-3.60), signifying higher infectiousness. Ct value decreased with time since 2nd and 3rd vaccinations. Ct values were highest for those who received their boosters in the month preceding the RT-qPCR test -- 0.86 cycles (95% CI: 0.72-1.00) higher than for unvaccinated persons. Ct value was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.20-1.39) cycles higher for those with a prior infection compared to those without prior infection, signifying lower infectiousness. Ct value declined gradually with age. Ct value was lowest for those who were tested because of symptoms and was highest for those who were tested for travel-related purposes. Ct value was lowest during the exponential-growth phase of the omicron wave and was highest after the wave peaked and was declining.

Conclusions: The BA.2 subvariant appears substantially more infectious than the BA.1 subvariant. This may reflect higher viral load and/or longer duration of infection, thereby explaining the rapid expansion of this subvariant in Qatar.

[The BA.2 variant may also be slightly better at evading immunity than BA.1, which could be contributing to its rapid spread. Although BA.2 is more contagious than BA.1, clinical data do not suggest a significant difference in disease severity. ...

BA.2 has been especially prominent in countries in Southeast Asia, Africa, and Europe. Recent analyses have indicated that it has displaced BA.1 as the dominant omicron sublineage in Denmark, Singapore, India, South Africa, and Austria. The rapid ascent of BA.2 is illustrated by the increase in its prevalence from 20% in the last week of December 2021 to 66% by the third week of January 2022 in Denmark.

The proportion of BA.2 cases in the United States remains low at 3.8% so far, but health experts expect it to rise. ...

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20MAR4WORLD7_1646510475.pdf.

In the past 24 hours, 29 countries: South Korea (254 326), Germany (203 972), Vietnam (173 631), Russia (89 174), Netherlands (68 309), Brazil (68 101), Japan (64 333), France (57 789), Hong Kong (52 523), USA (52 081), the UK (44 485), Italy (38 353), Turkey (38 283), Malaysia (33 209), Austria (31 566), Indonesia (26 347), Switzerland (24 915), Chile (24 632), Australia (22 854), Thailand (22 818), Spain (22 400), Denmark (19 178), New Zealand (18 882), Singapore (17 564), Greece (16 050), Belgium (14 713), Portugal (13 747), Poland (12 489), and Slovakia (11 029) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 8275 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 3 Mar 2022 to late 4 Mar 2022). The 7-day averages now indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and deaths.

A total of 64 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 33 of the 64 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 4 from the South East Asia region, and 1 is from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 7.7%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 17.2%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 30.9% decrease in daily reported cases and a 7.5% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 1.68 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 444.11 million cumulative reported cases and more than 6.01 million reported deaths. There has been a downward trend in the number of cases and deaths globally, however, transmission levels are still quite high. - Mod.UBA
