China's southern province of Guangdong scrambled to protect its water
supplies on Thursday as a toxic waste spill from a zinc smelter flowed
along a major river towards several sprawling cities, state media reported.
It is the 2nd environmental disaster to hit the country in as many months,
after an explosion at a chemical plant in the northeast poisoned drinking
water for millions and sent a frozen, poisonous slick heading slowly but
surely towards Russia. China apologized for that slick on Thursday.
In the south, cadmium levels had been found to be 10 times normal in the
Shaoguan city section of the North River cutting across Guangdong province
north to south, after the smelter's discharge of waste during equipment
maintenance last week. Several villages and factories near Yingde, a city
90 km (54 miles) downstream from Shaoguan, had been without running water
for days, the Xinhua news agency said on Thursday.
At a suburban Yingde cement plant, fire engines had been dispensing
drinking water to thousands of workers and their families, Xinhua said.
"Taps are only on for showers in the evening for a couple of hours. We've
been collecting drinking water with plastic buckets from fire engines since
Sunday," a worker surnamed Lu told Reuters by telephone. The city has begun
drawing drinking water for its 100 000 residents from a nearby reservoir,
Xinhua said.
Cadmium, a metallic element widely used in batteries, can cause liver and
kidney damage and lead to bone diseases. Compounds containing cadmium are
also carcinogenic.
The most polluted slick of water reached Shakou township, 30 km upstream
from Yingde, and dam gates at the nearby Baishiyao hydropower plant had
been lowered to stall it, a local government spokesman told Reuters by
telephone.
"We want to dilute the toxins there by reservoirs further upstream
increasing discharges and then flushing them quickly past Yingde," the
spokesman, surnamed Wang, said. "But we are still waiting for the experts
to decide when to do that."
The diluted pollutants should not affect Foshan and the provincial capital,
Guangzhou, cities of 800 000 and 9 million [respectively] in the booming
Pearl River Delta manufacturing hub, Xinhua said. "Nevertheless, the 2
cities have been asked to start emergency plans to ensure safe drinking
water," Xinhua said.
Qingyuan city, between Guangzhou and Yingde and with a population of half a
million, has also taken emergency measures. In Shaoguan, authorities had
halted operations at the zinc smelter -- China's 3rd largest -- and shut
down another 14 small smelters, Xinhua said.
In China's northeast, the Songhua River toxic slick was expected to reach
the Russian border city of Khabarovsk on Thursday but workers temporarily
dammed a waterway to divert the pollution away from Khabarovsk's water
supplies.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Qin Gang apologized to Russia but said
China had been quick to help minimize the damage.
"Water pollution is not something we want to see. But after this incident
occurred, the Chinese government took quick action and acted with a
responsible and serious attitude," Qin told a regular news conference. "We
want to deal with this issue in a responsible way in regards to our neighbors."

[This article is confusing. It is not clear whether this is a 2nd toxic
spill involving cadmium or whether cadmium is another contaminant along
with benzene.
The normal level for cadmium in the human diet appears to between 1 and 3
micrograms per day, without harm. However, long-term higher levels have
been associated with problems. When water is contaminated, it may result in
stomach irritation. However, for very long-term exposure, cancers have been
associated with cadmium intake.
Generally cadmium is associated with inhalation from welding and metal
works.- Mod.TG]
