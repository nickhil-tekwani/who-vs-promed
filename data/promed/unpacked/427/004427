The ongoing investigation into contagious equine
metritis (CEM) now includes more than 700 exposed
or positive horses, according to the USDA. The
investigation began in mid-December 2008, when a
Quarter Horse stallion on a Kentucky farm tested
positive during routine testing for international semen shipment.

According to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS), as of 24 Mar 2009 the
positive horses included 13 stallions and 3
mares. In addition to these horses, they had
confirmed the locations of 695 horses exposed to
_Taylorella equigenitalis_. The 711 horses were
located in 46 states. There were 112 exposed or
positive stallions in 19 states and 599 exposed
or positive mares in 44 states. Authorities were
still actively tracking 6 exposed mares and 4
exposed stallions. An exposed horse is one that
was bred to a positive horse, either naturally or
via artificial insemination, or one that is
otherwise epidemiologically linked to a positive
horse, as determined by animal health officials.

Of the 112 stallions involved, a total of 34 had
completed their entire testing and treatment
protocol and been determined to be negative for _T. equigenitalis_.

APHIS spokesman Jim Barrett said the USDA will be
taking a collaborative approach and covering some
costs associated with testing these horses, which
includes assisting the veterinarian taking
samples, mailing test samples, and laboratory
testing. The estimated cost of veterinary
services for testing ranges by state from USD
1500 to USD 5000 per animal tested.
