Diagnosis of anthrax not confirmed in resident of Novosibirsk Region
--------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the deputy head of the regional Rospotrebnadzor [Federal
Service for Consumer Protection and Human Welfare], Boris Yagudin,
laboratory tests did not confirm the preliminary diagnosis of anthrax,
which in late October 2011 had resulted in the hospitalization of a
female resident of the Chany area, Novosibirsk region. Her condition
was assessed as satisfactory.

"The diagnosis was not confirmed. In our department there is nothing,"
said Yagudin.

[My thanks to Sabine Zentis for the hyper-rapid translation and to
Sergey Netesov, vice rector (Research), Novosibirsk State University,
for tracking down the resolution of this late October 2011 case. This
is normally too late in the year for anthrax cases but October had
been an unusually warm month and the 1st snow did not fall until 27
Oct 2011. The clinical suspicion was serious. Fortunately it was not
anthrax.

Out of season anthrax outbreaks do occur and are usually the result of
contaminated feed being fed to livestock; this has been the Russian
experience with winter outbreaks in commercial piggeries with
contaminated bone meals in the pig feed. In other countries it is
usually from feeding hay that had, because of wet weather, become
contaminated with soil from a cattle grave during collection and
bailing. So if it looks like anthrax but there is snow on the ground,
still check it out with the appropriate laboratory tests. - Mod.MHJ]
