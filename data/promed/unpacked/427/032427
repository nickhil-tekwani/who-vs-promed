Health authorities in Spain have revealed the man who died from an outbreak of Legionnaires' in a Mallorcan holiday resort was a British tourist. They also said another 13 of the 19 people now known to have been affected so far in the unresolved outbreak were also holidaymakers from the UK.

The holidaymakers were struck down in Palmanova, which neighbours Magaluf, with 8 people all staying at the same unnamed hotel.

Regional health authority boss Maria Ramos said one British tourist, a man aged 61, was still being treated at Son Espases Hospital in the island capital Mallorca, the hospital where a 70-year-old British man died last [Wed 11 Oct 2017]. The rest of the Brits, aged from 46 to 87 are back in the UK after the end of their holidays.

They are understood to have been given the all-clear or are recovering from their illness, although Mrs Ramos said she was unaware of the evolution of 5 of the British nationals affected.

Health chiefs in Mallorca are now working on trying to locate the source of the outbreak in the Brit-popular resort of Palmanova next to the brash party resort of Magaluf with the help of a specialist lab in Madrid.

Positive samples were detected at an unnamed hotel in Palmanova where 9 of those affected were staying. The hotel has now closed after its water supply was shut down.

[The news report above says that 19 tourists in Palmanova on the island of Mallorca, Spain have developed Legionnaires' disease; 13 of the 19 are from the UK. We are not told over what period of time this event occurred. Another news report said that since mid-September [2017], 17 British tourists who returned from Palmanova developed Legionnaires' disease (https://www.euroweeklynews.com/3.0.15/news/on-euro-weekly-news/mallorca/146101-travel-warning-issued-after-17-brits-infected-by-legionnaire's-disease-in-mallorca). Nine of the British tourists with Legionnaires' disease, one of whom died, stayed at the same hotel in Palmanova and samples from this hotel were positive for _Legionella_. The hotel has now closed after its water supply was shut down.

We are not told if all the tourists have the same genotype (which would suggest a common source outbreak) or if the genotypes of the clinical _Legionella_ isolates matched those of the hotel's environmental isolates, which would identify the hotel as the source for the infection for its guests. ProMED-mail would appreciate more information in this regard from knowledgeable sources as it develops in this ongoing investigation.

Palmanova is a major holiday destination for Europeans, especially from Germany and the UK, on the Balearic island of Mallorca (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palma_Nova). - Mod.ML
