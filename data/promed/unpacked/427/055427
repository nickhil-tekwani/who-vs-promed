A South Korean woman has been confirmed to be infected by the killer tick virus, the 1st such case this year [2015], the health authorities said on Friday [22 May 2015].

The 73 year old woman living in a rural city in South Chungcheong Province was admitted to a hospital in Daejeon on 12 May [2015], 3 days after showing symptoms of SFTS, or severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome, caused by a virus carried by ticks, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).

[The 1st case of SFTS was reported in China in 2010, and in 2013, SFTSV infections were reported in South Korea and Japan. In South Korea, the 1st human case of SFTS was confirmed in May 2013. Although not a particularly common infection, a report on 21 Jun 2014 indicated that the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined the 35 Koreans who had been confirmed with SFTS virus infections over the past year. According to the report, the number of patients was highest in the month of June 2014, accounting for about a quarter of the total, followed by the months of May, July and September 2014. Out of the 35 confirmed SFTS cases, 16 have died so far, putting the case fatality rate at 46 per cent (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140622.2558325).

SFTS virus is a tick-transmitted phlebovirus in the Bunyavirus family. An article published by Yun and colleagues indicated that _H. longicornis_ ticks have been considered the principal tick vector of SFTSV but the virus has been shown to be present in _A. testudinarium_ and _Ix. nipponensis_ ticks, which might serve as potential vectors of this virus in South Korea. However, the presence of viral RNA in a tick does not confirm that the tick can transmit the virus (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20140705.2589725).
