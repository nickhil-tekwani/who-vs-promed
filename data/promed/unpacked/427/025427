Towards the end of the measles epidemic in France
-------------------------------------------------
After an epidemic peak extending into March 2011, measles seems to be losing strength gradually, according to the latest data presented by the French Institute of Health Surveillance (Institut de veille sanitaire -- InVS)InVS) on Tue 17 Apr 2012. Some 350 cases of measles were reported between 1 Jan and 31 Mar 2012 in France, compared with more than 3500 cases for the month of March 2011.

A measles epidemic has been raging in France since 1 Jan 2008. In total, more than 22 000 cases of measles have been reported since the epidemic began, with a 3rd large-scale outbreak ending in October last year [2011].

In 2011, nearly 15 000 cases of measles were reported in France, of whom 714 suffered severe pneumonia and 6 died.

Faced with the decreasing number of cases since the beginning of the year, the InVS experts believe that the figures do not indicate an imminent 4th wave of cases. However, the French, especially those in the 15-30 age group, should update their immunization status with 2 doses of vaccine.

Measles outbreak in Ukraine – vaccination advice
------------------------------------------------
Since January 2012, over 5100 cases have been reported and it is expected that this will increase. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health recommends that unvaccinated people traveling to the European Football Championships in Poland in Ukraine and who have not previously had measles should take the vaccine in good time [see below] before they travel -- see CDC recommendations at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/downloads/vis-mmr.pdf.

The Ukrainian outbreak is concentrated near the border with Hungary, Poland and Slovakia, but it is expected that the outbreak will increase in the next few months and spread to more areas. As measles is highly infectious and vaccine coverage in Ukraine is low, there is a high chance of exposure to the measles virus. People who are unvaccinated or are not immune to measles are at significant risk of infection.

Measles is extremely contagious and is the most serious of the childhood diseases included in the childhood immunisation programme in Norway. Of the childhood diseases that can be prevented by vaccine, measles is the most common cause of death globally. Young children and children with other diseases are most at risk for serious complications, but older children and adults can also become seriously ill with measles.

The risk of contracting measles and other infectious diseases is likely to increase during the European Football Championships (EURO2012) taking place in Poland and Ukraine from the 8th June to 1st July 2012. Large crowds will gather in football stadiums and city areas, which will promote the spread of infectious diseases.

The Norwegian Institute of Public Health recommends that anyone traveling to the Ukraine should be protected against measles, either as a result of previous infection or vaccination. Unvaccinated adults are recommended to take one dose of the MMR vaccine before travelling. Protection against measles is effective 2-3 weeks after vaccination, so the vaccine should be taken in good time before departure.

People who have had measles are immune and do not need to take the vaccine. Children can be vaccinated from 9 months of age. If the first MMR vaccine is given before 12 months of age, the child should receive a second dose at 15 months. Vaccination is also recommended against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough) and polio. People who have previously been vaccinated should have a booster dose every 10 years.

In recent years, vaccine coverage in Ukraine has decreased significantly, and according to reports from the WHO/UNICEF in 2010, vaccine coverage was 56 per cent for one dose of MMR vaccine and 41 per cent for 2 doses. Low vaccine coverage has also been reported for other vaccines (diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough 52 per cent, polio 58 per cent).

Measles is highly contagious. The low vaccine coverage in Ukraine means that measles virus can spread rapidly in the population. It is expected that the ongoing outbreak will spread unless effective vaccination campaigns are conducted in the unvaccinated part of the population. Due to generally low vaccine coverage in Ukraine, there is also the risk of outbreaks of other vaccine-preventable diseases such as rubella (German measles), mumps, polio and diphtheria.

Since the vaccine coverage in Norway is 95 per cent, the risk of an outbreak of measles in this country is small. In Norway, measles immunisation involves 2 doses of MMR vaccine given at 15 months of age and in the 6th grade in school.

Fears city could experience 2nd measles outbreak
------------------------------------------------
Fears are growing that Brighton and Hove [in the county of Sussex] could experience a second serious outbreak of measles. There have been 37 confirmed cases of the virus in the city so far this year, compared to just over 40 for the whole of 2011. The rapidly rising numbers have sparked concerns of a repeat of the outbreak in 2009 which affected more than 100 adults and children. There are fears more cases could emerge as children returned to school this week. Health bosses are urging people to get their children vaccinated with the measles, mumps and rubella [MMR] vaccine to reduce the risk of infection.


There have been 10 cases in West Sussex and 11 in East Sussex this year, including recent reports in the Lewes area. The county as a whole had 172 cases of the disease in 2011 and experts say the virus appears to have established itself in the community. Most cases are affecting school-age children who have not had both doses of the MMR vaccine although younger children and babies who have not been vaccinated yet are also at risk. The poor uptake of the MMR vaccine is being blamed for the outbreak, with Brighton and Hove's rate standing at about 85%. The city has one of the lowest take-up rates for the vaccine in the South East although the figure is improving. The World Health Organisation recommends that 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated to offer the best possible protection against a disease.

David Hagen, consultant in communicable diseases for the Health Protection Agency's Sussex and Surrey unit, said: “Cases are being found in different parts of the community rather than in a specific area. The county is reflecting a national pattern and it is obviously something of concern to us. We would urge people to make sure their children have the MMR vaccine as soon as possible.”

Measles outbreak warning
----------------------
Parents in Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire are being warned about the possibility of a measles outbreak in the area. A warning has been given this week that the ongoing measles outbreak at a school in north Wales could easily be repeated in the Hywel Dda Health Board area. Around 500 children could be at risk locally and parents are being urged to see their GP as soon as possible if their children have not had the 2 doses of the MMR vaccine. Dr Lyn Harris, director of public health for Hywel Dda says that [as long as] uptake of the MMR vaccine in the area continues to fall short of the target, a similar outbreak could easily be seen here. Around 40 cases of measles are currently being investigated at the north Wales school.

Dr Harris said: “All children need to receive 2 doses of the MMR vaccination, which protects against mumps and rubella as well as measles. Until 95 per cent of children have received 2 doses of the vaccine, there is still a risk that measles outbreaks will happen. In the counties of Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire, latest figures show that 13 per cent of 5-year-old children have had no doses of MMR or only one. This means that almost 500 children in the area are not fully vaccinated, and this is not enough to prevent outbreaks." She adds that although children should receive their lst dose of MMR at 12 months and the 2nd at 3 years and 4 months, it is never too late to catch up on missed doses. “To avoid a measles outbreak in the area, I am urging parents whose children are not fully vaccinated to speak to their GP as soon as possible,” she said.

Dr Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine preventable disease programme of Public Health Wales, added: “Measles is highly contagious, spreads very easily, and can be extremely serious. The outbreak in North Wales continues to make children very ill. If this kind of outbreak can happen there, it can happen in any school in Wales. MMR is a safe and effective vaccine, and is available free from your local surgery. Measles can be fatal in rare cases and there have been two deaths in the UK from measles in recent years.”

Parents to blame for measles outbreak, say health workers
-------------------------------------------------
Health workers have blamed the outbreak of measles in 18 districts on parents’ failure to take their children for immunisation. A visit to the newly-opened Naguru Hospital revealed that more than 100 cases had been registered at the facility since 24 Feb 2012, with the majority of the affected children coming from Naguru, Kinawataka and Banda suburbs of Kampala. The officer in-charge of the pediatric ward, Uganda Friendship hospital-Naguru, Dr Justine Nalwadda, yesterday said many mothers are reluctant to take their children for immunisation.

“Since the facility opened, very few children have turned up for immunisation not because there are no children being born but parents are not keen and do not consider the dangers associated with failure to complete the dosage while men have left the responsibility to women,” Dr Nalwadda said. She also attributed the problem to lack of basic information on the killer immunisable diseases, especially among people in upcountry areas.

Data from the Ministry of Health shows that 3270 cases have so far been confirmed in Kampala, Namayingo, Jinja, Busia, Bugiri, Nebbi, Sheema, Wakiso, Iganga, Luuka, Lwengo, Masaka, Mayunge, Buikwe, Mityana, Koboko, Mitooma and Mbale districts.

But an official from the Ministry of Health, who declined to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the press, said there has been a problem of funding following the misuse of the GAVI [Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation] funds that was meant for immunisation programmes in the country. “The withdrawal of GAVI funds in 2006 created a funding shortage. Since then, the public education programmes as well as outreach programmes has reduced and immunisation has dropped drastically,” the source said.

According to the source, the spell led to a shortage of vaccines and shortage of facilities. The Parmanent Secretary in the Ministry of Health, Dr Asuman Lukwago, said the ministry had mobilised money from development partners for special immunisatition activities set to begin on 26 May across the country, adding that the sensitisation programme will start next week.

“We are going to carry out a 5-day countrywide immunisation programme in response to these outbreaks. We already have the money with a deficit of about 3 billion Uganda SHs [USD 390 000] which we have requested for,” the PS said.

Measles -- United States, 2011
--------------------------
In 2000, the United States achieved measles elimination (defined as interruption of year-round endemic measles transmission) (1). However, importations of measles into the United States continue to occur, posing risks for measles outbreaks and sustained measles transmission. During 2011, a total of 222 measles cases (incidence rate: 0.7 per 1 million population) and 17 measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more cases linked in time or place) were reported to CDC, compared with a median of 60 (range: 37–140) cases and 4 (range: 2–10) outbreaks reported annually during 2001–2010.

This report updates an earlier report on measles in the United States during the first 5 months of 2011 (2). Of the 222 cases, 112 (50%) were associated with 17 outbreaks, and 200 (90%) were associated with importations from other countries, including 52 (26%) cases in U.S. residents returning from abroad and 20 (10%) cases in foreign visitors. Other cases associated with importations included 67 (34%) linked epidemiologically to importations, 39 (20%) with virologic evidence suggesting recent importation, and 22 (11%) linked to cases with virologic evidence of recent importation. Most patients (86%) were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. The increased numbers of outbreaks and measles importations into the United States underscore the ongoing risk for measles among unvaccinated persons and the importance of vaccination against measles (3).

Confirmed measles cases in the United States are reported by state and local health departments to CDC using a standard case definition. A measles case is considered confirmed if it is laboratory-confirmed or meets the clinical case definition (an illness characterized by a generalized rash lasting equal to or more than 3 days, a temperature of equal to or more than 101°F [38.3°C], and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis) and is linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case. Laboratory confirmation of measles is made by detection in serum of measles-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), a significant rise in measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, isolation of measles virus, or detection of measles virus by nucleic acid amplification from a clinical specimen. Cases are considered importations if exposure to measles virus occurred outside the United States 7–21 days before rash onset and rash occurred within 21 days of entry into the United States, with no known exposure to measles in the United States during that time.

For this report, U.S. residents were classified as eligible or ineligible for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for measles vaccination (3). Vaccine-eligible patients were defined as U.S. residents who
1) were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status,
2) did not have any contraindications for vaccination, and
3) were either born after 1957 and aged equal to or more than 12 months without previous documentation of presumptive evidence of immunity to measles† or aged 6–11 months with recent history of international travel.

During 2011, a provisional total of 222 measles cases were reported from 31 states (Fig.1 - see source URL). The median age of the patients was 14 years (range: 3 months to 84 years); 27 (14%) were aged less than 12 months, 51 (26%) were aged 1–4 years, 42 (21%) were aged 5–19 years, and 76 (39%) were aged equal to or more than 20 years. Most patients were unvaccinated (65%) or had unknown vaccination status (21%). Of the 222, a total of 196 were U.S. residents. Of those U.S. residents who had measles, 166 were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 141 (85%) were eligible for MMR vaccination, 18 (11%) were too young for vaccination, 6(4%) were born before 1957 and presumed immune, and one (1%) had previous laboratory evidence of presumptive immunity to measles. Among the 141 patients who were unvaccinated and eligible for MMR vaccination, 9 (6%) were infants aged 6–11 months and had a recent history of international travel; 14 (10%) were aged 12–15 months, the age recommended for receiving the lst dose of MMR vaccine; and 66 (47%) were aged 16 months through 19 years. Of those 66 patients, 50 (76%) had not been vaccinated because of a philosophic, religious, or personal objection.

Among the 70 (32%) measles patients who were hospitalized, 17 (24%) had diarrhea, 15 (21%) were dehydrated, and 12 (17%) had pneumonia. No cases of encephalitis and no deaths were reported.

Of the 222 U.S. measles cases, 200 (90%) were associated with importations, of which 72 (36%) were importations from other countries, 67 (30%) were linked epidemiologically to importations, 39 (20%) had virologic evidence (i.e., isolation of a viral genotype known to circulate in a country with measles) that suggested recent importation, and 22 (11%) were linked to cases with virologic evidence of recent importation. The source of measles acquisition in 22 cases was not determined through contact tracing or viral isolation (i.e., linking the patient to a country with measles or isolation of a viral genotype known to circulate in a country with measles). Importations were reported during 31 of the 52 reporting weeks (Fig. 2 - see source URL). Among the 72 cases of measles importation, 52 were linked to U.S. residents who had traveled abroad, and 20 were linked to foreign visitors. Almost half (46%) of the 72 measles importations occurred among persons who acquired the disease in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region (see TABLE. Countries where imported measles was acquired, by World Health Organization (WHO) region, number of cases (n = 72), and genotype — United States, 2011 in source URL).

17 outbreaks accounted for 112 (50%) of the 222 cases. The median outbreak size was 6 cases (range: 3–21 cases), and outbreaks lasted a median of 18 days (range: 6–69 days).

Measles was laboratory confirmed in 200 (90%) cases: 94 (47%) by detection of measles-specific IgM and measles virus nucleic acid, 69 (35%) by detection of IgM only, and 37 (19%) by detection of measles virus nucleic acid only; 6 genotypes of measles virus were identified among samples collected: D4, D9, D8, B3, G3, and H1.

MMWR Editorial Note:

Measles elimination has been maintained in the United States for more than a decade through high population immunity secondary to high MMR vaccination coverage. Coverage with 1 dose has been more than 90% among children aged 19–35 months since 1996. The increase in measles importations and outbreaks during 2011 serves as a reminder that measles remains endemic in many parts of the world and unvaccinated U.S. residents continue to place themselves and others in their communities at risk for measles and its complications.

The increase in importations reflects recent increases in the incidence of measles in countries visited by U.S. travelers. The source of almost half of the measles importations in 2011 was the WHO European Region, which reported more than 30 000 cases of measles, including 27 cases of measles encephalitis, a complication that often results in permanent neurologic sequelae, and 8 measles-related deaths in 2011; 5 countries (France, Italy, Romania, Spain, and Germany) accounted for more than 90% of cases reported to the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (4). Although measles has been eliminated in the Region of the Americas since 2002 and considerable progress has been achieved in global measles control, measles is still common in many countries. Importations of measles virus into the United States will likely continue and cause outbreaks in communities that have clusters of unvaccinated persons. Maintenance of high MMR vaccination coverage is essential to prevent measles outbreaks and sustain measles elimination in the United States. Despite the relatively small number of reported cases in the United States, the public and the health-care providers must remain vigilant. A drop in MMR vaccination coverage in a community can increase the risk for large, sustained measles outbreaks, as experienced recently in Canada and France (4,5), or reestablishment of endemic transmission, as experienced in the United Kingdom (6).

Occasionally, measles cases are reported without apparent links to importations, but virologic evidence suggests recent importation of an undetected case or chain of cases. Given travel patterns, the highly infectious nature of measles virus, and limitations of surveillance systems, not every importation of measles virus into the United States is detected. Therefore, collection of samples for virus detection is extremely important. Genetic characterization of viruses can help to confirm or suggest the likely source of imported viruses because measles genotypes are distributed heterogeneously in regions that have not yet eliminated measles (7,8).

Health-care providers play an important role in maintaining elimination of measles in the United States. Patients with measles frequently seek medical care; therefore, health-care providers should maintain a high awareness of measles and suspect measles in persons who have a febrile rash illness and clinically compatible symptoms (e.g., cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis) and who recently have traveled abroad or have had contact with travelers. Providers should implement isolation precautions immediately and promptly report suspected measles cases to their local health department to limit spread to other susceptible persons, including those who cannot be vaccinated because of medical contraindications or those too young for vaccination. In several outbreaks during 2011, despite seeking medical care, the source case was not identified until after the first or second generation of cases was reported. Misdiagnosis and delayed reporting resulted in missed opportunities to prevent additional cases because of delayed implementation of control measures. Nevertheless, for most cases, early reporting by providers and rapid control efforts by state and local public health agencies have prevented measles transmission and limited the size of outbreaks.

Health-care providers should encourage vaccination of all eligible patients, including children and adults. MMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children at age 12–15 months, with a second dose at age 4–6 years. Two doses of MMR vaccine also are recommended for unvaccinated health-care personnel, international travelers, and students attending post–high school educational institutions. Other adults without evidence of measles immunity should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine (3). In addition, providers should remind their patients who plan to travel internationally of the increased risk for measles and potential exposures during bus, train, or air travel and at large international events or gatherings (e.g., Euro 2012 and the 2012 Summer Olympics), and of the importance of vaccination. All persons aged equal to or more than 6 months who will be traveling outside the United States and are eligible to receive MMR vaccine should be vaccinated before travel. Children aged equal to or more than 12 months should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days, before travel (3).

† Documented receipt of 2 doses of live measles virus–containing vaccine, laboratory evidence of immunity, documentation of physician-diagnosed measles, or birth before 1957.

[Achievement of measles elimination was declared in the United States in 2000, but the disease remains poorly controlled in much of the world. Cases of measles are imported regularly into the United States. During 2011, 222 cases of measles and 17 outbreaks were reported in the United States, an increase compared with cases and outbreaks reported during 2001–2010. Importations accounted for 72 (32%) cases, including 52 (72%) cases among U.S. residents who had traveled abroad recently. Among patients who were U.S. residents, 85% were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status and were eligible for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination.

MMR vaccine is highly effective in preventing measles and its complications. Rapid public health response and high 2-dose MMR vaccine coverage are essential in preventing measles outbreaks and sustaining elimination in the United States. One dose of MMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children at age 12–15 months, with a second dose at age 4–6 years. Adults without evidence of measles immunity should receive one MMR vaccine dose, whereas 2 doses are recommended for unvaccinated health-care personnel, international travelers, and students attending post–high school educational institutions.

Genetic characterization of viruses can help to confirm or suggest the likely source of imported viruses because measles genotypes are distributed heterogeneously in regions that have not yet eliminated measles. Six genotypes of measles virus were identified among samples collected in the Unitd States: D4, D9, D8, B3, G3, and H1. - Mod.CP]

Measles cases at Blacktown Hospital prompt health warning
---------------------------------------------------------
Doctors have warned western Sydney residents to be vigilant after 2 cases of measles were diagnosed recently. Dr Vicky Sheppeard, manager of the local public health unit, said 2 residents had been diagnosed with measles at Blacktown Hospital this week. It is thought that the infection was caught by one resident during a recent overseas trip who then passed it on to the 2nd after returning home, Dr Sheppeard said. "Measles is one of the most easily spread diseases and just being in the same room as someone with measles can result in infection," she said.

The public health unit has been working with Blacktown Hospital to identify and contact people who may have been in the Emergency Department at the same time as one of the patients on 13 Apr 2012. Dr Sheppeard said the initial symptoms of measles were fever, tiredness, runny-nose cough and sore, red eyes. "Symptoms usually begin around 10 days after contact with an infected person, so people need to be particularly aware of any signs of infection in themselves or their children over the coming week," she said.

Dr Sheppeard said a red, blotchy rash appears 3-4 days after initial symptoms. Adults between 25 and 46 years old are often susceptible to measles as when they were young only one dose of vaccine was recommended. Free vaccine from the GP is recommended for people in this age group, especially if they are planning overseas travel.
