High rates of coccidioidomycosis in Arizona appear to parallel
increasing reports for the United States as a whole. See graph
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/cocci-us.jpg>. Coccidioidomycosis is
the 4th most common infectious disease reported in Arizona (i.e.,
after gonorrhea, chlamydia, and chronic hepatitis C).
Coccidioidomycosis acccounts for 29 percent of community-acquired
pneumonia among adults in the Tucson area (2003 to 2004).
- The state reported an average of 211 cases per year during 1980 to
1989; 460 during 1990 to 1995.
- 134 fatal cases were reported during 1990 to 1994 - including 72 in 1993.
- The highest rate in this state is for the age group over 65.
- 42 percent of Phoenix school children were skin test-positive
during the 1950's.
- Rates increased from 33 per 100 000 in 1998, to 43 per 100 000 in 2001.
