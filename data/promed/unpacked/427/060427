Typhoid has [Bangalore city doctors worried. After being an essentially
summer-time disease caused by contaminated water and food, it is now
rampant even in winters. Some centres are receiving as many as 3-4
admissions every day.
But perhaps even more serious is the drug-resistance that the disease seems
to have developed, as also its various manifestations which are affecting
the liver, kidneys and brain in addition to the intestinal organs.
Says Dr S.V. Chowti, consultant physician at Mallya Hospital, "Being a
referral hospital, we are seeing very serious cases here and they seem to
be coming not only from Bangalore but from all parts of the state. And,
what's worrying is that it is coming forth in various manifestations.
Multi-organ failure necessitates emergency hospital admission."
He suggests that typical symptoms like fever and headache, accompanied by
vomiting and diarrhoea, are now being compounded by meningitis, enteric
nephritis and effects on the liver. This, coupled with the fact that signs
of drug-resistance seem to have set in, is forcing doctors to adopt new
treatment plans.
Points out Dr Naresh Bhatt, consultant gastroenterologist at Bangalore
Hospital, "Drug resistance is essentially due to the abuse of antibiotics.
Some doctors prescribe antibiotics for all and sundry, sometimes under
pressure from the patients. As a result, when you really need them, they
don't work."
As a result, the most commonly used drug against typhoid, Ciprofloxacin,
has in many cases not been able to combat the disease, says Chowti. "Even
after 10 days, the fever does not come down in some cases. As a result,
the treatment drags on for longer," he says.
Dr Chowti adds that he is being forced to use a combination of two other
drugs to handle the disease. In some city hospitals, doctors have resorted
to treating typhoid patients with a line of drugs that were in use before
Ciprofloxacin came into use.
Dr Bhatt is of the opinion that such cases of drug-resistance among typhoid
patients has been seen in the city for the last few years. "This is
largely due to the use of higher antibiotics when there is no need for
them. Very often, they are used merely on suspicion."
Experts say that typhoid normally spreads through poor quality water and
food, and so is essentially a summer disease. _Salmonella typhi_ is the
organism that causes the problem. They also suggest that the Widal
test being used to detect typhoid is not a surefire test, and stool and
blood cultures need to be carried out to make oneself doubly sure.

[This article leaves some uncertainty about the percentage of the cases
described that are truly typhoid fever. It is also unclear whether the
ciprofloxacin resistance described is a reflection of proper microbiological
characterization of antimicrobial susceptibility, or of clinical failures
in cases that may or may not be correctly diagnosed. The Widal test is a
serological test for antibodies against the O and H antigens of _Salmonella_
sp. The article is correct that fecal and blood cultures are required to
confirm the
diagnosis. - Mod.ES
