The Livestock, Fisheries and Veterinary Services department of the Kisii County government has ordered that sheep and goats within Subugo sub-location and its environs be put under quarantine following an anthrax outbreak.

Anthrax is a highly infectious disease that occurs naturally in soil and commonly affects domestic and wild animals. Human beings can be infected if they come into contact with infected animals or contaminated animal products, and the effects can lead to death.

Bobasi sub-county Veterinary Officer Dr. Richard Ongwae, in a statement to newsrooms on Wednesday [4 Jan 2023], said the quarantine restrictions will remain in place until further notice. "Being a veterinary officer appointed by the county government of Kisii, I do hereby require the following animals namely, cattle sheep and goats and their products to be detained within Subugo village, Subugo sublocation and its environs," noted Dr. Ongwae.

In the meantime, Dr. Ongwae directed that no other animals should also be moved into the restricted area unless granted permission from him or the inspector in charge. He further directed that the animals not be moved into the areas unless previously disinfected as per the required directions.

The Veterinary Officer also directed that carcasses of all animals dying from the disease "be either buried at the depth of not less than 4 feet below the surface or burnt at the expense of the owner."

[We have had no prior reports related to government action in Kisii County or any reports in previous years. So the reality of why these quarantine decisions were made depends on any subsequent information from Kenya.

Kisii County is in the southwest corner of Kenya, close to Lake Victoria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kisii_County). Thanks to Mahmoud. - Mod.MHJ
