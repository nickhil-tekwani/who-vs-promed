I have seen a patient whom I suspect is suffering from Crimean-Congo
hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus infection.

The patient was admitted to the People's Hospital in Bhopal on Thu 10
Feb 2011 with history of fever, gastrointestinal bleeding, psychosis,
cardiovascular changes and symptoms closely similar to those of CCHF.
As the CCHF virus is [extremely contagious], I [am deeply concerned].
I am concerned additionally because the patient's residence is close
to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal.

I would welcome advice on diagnostic procedures and obtaining
confirmatory tests.

[An outbreak of CCHF was described recently in northern India in the
adjacent state of Gujarat, and it can be assumed that this disease is
likely to be prevalent over a wide area (see ProMED-mail references
below). However, CCHF has to be distinguished from dengue fever in
regions where the 2 diseases co-exist. Diagnosis of suspected CCHF
should be performed in a high biosafety level laboratory. IgG and IgM
antibodies may be detected in serum by enzyme-linked immunoassay from
the 6th day of illness, with IgM antibodies remaining detectable for
up to 4 months. In contrast, IgG antibodies decline but may remain
detectable for up to 5 years. CCHF is observed most frequently in
persons involved in animal husbandry or the processing of animal products.

Bhopal is the capital of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and is
the administrative headquarters of Bhopal District and Bhopal Division.
