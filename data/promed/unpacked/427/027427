Following a continued spike in new HPAI outbreaks, an order was introduced to keep poultry and captive birds housed specified areas of eastern England. This was announced by the agriculture department, Defra, on 8 Oct [2022].

As an extension to the avian influenza prevention zone (AIPZ) measures introduced in this area last month [September 2022], affected owners are urged to make preparations for the more stringent measures in the coming days.

From 12 Oct [2022], it will be mandatory for all bird owners in the counties of Norfolk, Suffolk, and parts of Essex to keep poultry and captive birds confined in houses. Furthermore, stricter biosecurity procedures must be followed.

Under the previous AIPZ, there were requirements to restrict access to farms for nonessential visitors, disinfect vehicles regularly, and ensure workers changed clothing and footwear before entering bird enclosures.

In addition from this week in the high-risk area, all poultry and captive birds will have to be housed or kept in netted enclosures, with minimum direct or indirect access to wild birds, and none to ponds and watercourses. Before and after contact with birds, clothing, footwear, equipment, and vehicles must be cleaned and disinfected. Poultry houses must be cleaned and disinfected continuously, vermin controlled, and disinfectant points must be kept effective at all entry and exit points. Last but not least, records must be kept of mortalities, movements of poultry and products, and any changes in production.

According to the Animal and Plant Health Agency, which is part of Defra, there have been 152 confirmed outbreaks of HPAI in England since October of 2021, and 18 since the start of this month (as of 9 Oct [2022]).

Of the latest outbreaks, 13 were in commercial poultry flocks or captive birds in the newly restricted parts of eastern England. Other cases were detected at 2 locations in Staffordshire (central England), and one each in Oxfordshire (south-east), Somerset (south-west), and Lancashire (north-west).

[2] Netherlands: HPAI vaccine trials

At the end of September [2022], Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR) announced it was testing several vaccines against HPAI. Part of Wageningen University & Research, WBVR was commissioned to carry out the experiments by the Dutch agriculture ministry.

Currently under investigation are vaccines from 3 commercial companies against virus of the H5 family in laying hens, compared with experimental products developed using new technologies.

According to avian flu researcher Nancy Beerens, the trial period will last 3 months, and these vaccines will be compared for efficacy, clinical signs, and virus transmission. This latter point is particularly important, according to Beerens, because a vaccine that does not reduce virus transmission sufficiently could lead to the "silent spread" of the infection to more farms.

"This aspect is one of the reasons why the European Union has rules in place for vaccinated poultry," she said.

Combined with those of similar trials carried out elsewhere in Europe, she added, the results from Wageningen might pave the way for vaccination of poultry as part of future European agricultural policy.

[In view of the observed spread of HPAI H5N1 in the northern and eastern provinces -- Drenthe, Friesland, Gelderland, Groningen, and Overijssel -- the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture published an announcement requiring the earlier introduction of mandatory confinement and screening of poultry. All commercial birds must be kept housed and subjected to regular testing. Only exceptions are pheasants, waterfowl, and ratites (ostriches), which need not be confined but do need to be monitored. Meanwhile, noncommercial birds such as those at zoos and in hobby flocks must be shielded so they have no contact with wild birds or their droppings.

Europe's 2021-2022 HPAI H5N1 epidemic season has become its largest. The latest data from the joint EFSA, ECDC, and EU reference laboratory report, June-September 2022 (see citation), show a total of 2467 outbreaks in poultry, 48 million birds culled in the affected establishments, 187 detections in captive birds, and 3573 HPAI events in wild birds. Additionally, the geographical extent of the outbreak is unprecedented, ranging from Svalbard islands to South Portugal and eastern to Ukraine, affecting 37 European countries. Human health has not been affected.
