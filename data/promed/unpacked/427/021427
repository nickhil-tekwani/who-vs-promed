[A 16 Jun 2022 report stated that "US testing for monkeypox is insufficient to determine how widespread the virus is and where new cases are cropping up, according to infectious disease experts and advocates concerned about a sluggish response to the outbreak that's already hit 32 countries. While government labs have the capacity to test as many as 8000 samples a week, they're only using 2% of that capability, suggesting that about 23 monkeypox tests are being performed a day, said James Krellenstein, the cofounder of PrEP4All, an HIV advocacy group that widened its focus during the pandemic. Much more testing is needed to find out where the pathogen is and how fast it's moving, he said" (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-06-16/monkeypox-cases-could-spread-unseen-in-us-if-testing-bottlenecks-don-t-improve; communicated by Mary Marshall, <mjm2022@googlemail.com>). - Mod.TY]

Summary
------
Since May 2022, monkeypox cases, which have historically been rare in the United States, have been identified in 18 states and territories among both persons returning from international travel and their close contacts domestically. Globally, more than 1600 cases have been reported from more than 30 countries; the case count continues to rise daily. In the United States, evidence of person-to-person disease transmission in multiple states and reports of clinical cases with some uncharacteristic features have raised concern that some cases are not being recognized and tested.

This Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Update serves to alert clinicians to clinical presentations of monkeypox seen so far in the United States and to provide updated and expanded case definitions intended to encourage testing for monkeypox among persons presenting for care with relevant history, signs, and symptoms. In addition, this Health Update provides an update to a HAN Health Advisory that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued 20 May 2022 titled Monkeypox Virus Infection in the United States and Other Non-endemic Countries -- 2022. In people with epidemiologic risk factors, rashes initially considered characteristic of more common infections (e.g., varicella zoster, herpes, syphilis) should be carefully evaluated for concurrent characteristic monkeypox rash (see images and links to [at source URL]) and considered for testing.

Quebec now has a total of 141 confirmed cases of monkeypox, the province's health department said Thursday [16 Jun 2022].The latest update is a rise of 9 from the previous count released earlier this week, when that number stood at 132. The majority of infections are in Montreal, public health authorities have said. The province has administered 3936 doses of the smallpox vaccine Imvamune since late May [2022], when it first became available.

This afternoon [17 Jun 2022], the Ministry of Health (MINSAL) reported that the Institute of Public Health (ISP) confirmed Chile's 1st PCR test-positive monkeypox case.

According to the information provided in a statement MINSAL transmitted, the infected individual is a young adult from the Metropolitan Region with a history of travel to Europe and who presented symptoms of sudden exanthema (spots on the skin), vesiculated lesions, crusted skin accompanied by necrosis and swollen lymph nodes.

The Regional Health Authority, as they pointed out, applied the surveillance protocol established by the Ministry of Health, and the patient is in good health and without complications.

The ministry recommended that people consult a doctor if they have traveled abroad, have had close skin-to-skin contact, including sexual intercourse, and have sudden onset of unexplained skin lesions with one or more symptoms such as fever, swollen glands, muscle or back pain, and necrosis.

Latest
------
The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has detected 46 additional cases of monkeypox in England, 3 additional cases in Scotland and one in Wales. This brings the total number confirmed in the UK to 574, as of 16 Jun 2022.

There are currently 550 confirmed cases in England, 16 in Scotland, 2 in Northern Ireland and 6 in Wales.

Anyone can get monkeypox, particularly if you have had close contact, including sexual contact, with an individual with symptoms. Currently most cases have been in men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with men.

Contact a sexual health clinic if you have a rash with blisters and you've been either:
- In close contact, including sexual contact, with someone who has or might have monkeypox (even if they've not been tested yet) in the past 3 weeks
- To West or Central Africa in the past 3 weeks

Dr William Welfare, Incident Director at UKHSA, said: "As case numbers of monkeypox continue to rise and with many summer events and festivals ahead, we're reminding people to be aware of the symptoms of monkeypox, particularly if you've recently had new or multiple sexual partners, to help prevent further spread and protect others."

If you have a rash with blisters, or any other monkeypox symptoms, don't go to events, meet with friends or have sexual contact. Instead, stay at home and contact 111 or your local sexual health service for advice. Please contact the clinic ahead of your visit and avoid close contact with others until you've been seen by a clinician.

UKHSA is working closely with partners across the country, including event organisers and venues, to raise public awareness of monkeypox symptoms so everyone has a safe, happy and healthy summer.

[A 13 Jun 2022 report in MedRxiv stated that "the current outbreak has shown distinct epidemiological features compared with past outbreaks in non-endemic settings, most notably its observed rapid growth and predominant spread among men who have sex with men (MSM). We use a branching process transmission model fitted to empirical sexual partnership data in the UK to show that the heavy-tailed nature of the sexual partnership degree distribution, where a small fraction of individuals have disproportionately large numbers of partners, can explain the sustained growth of monkeypox cases among the MSM population despite the absence of such patterns of spread in past outbreaks. We also suggest that the basic reproduction number (R0) for monkeypox over the MSM sexual contact network may be substantially greater than 1 for a plausible range of assumptions, which poses a challenge to outbreak containment efforts. Ensuring ongoing support and tailored public health messaging to facilitate prevention and early detection among MSM with a large number of sexual partners is warranted" (https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.13.22276353v1). - Mod.TY]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
--------
In May 2022, outbreaks of monkeypox have been reported in countries where the monkeypox virus is not endemic. We estimate the incubation period for monkeypox, using the reported time of exposure and symptom onset for 18 confirmed cases detected in the Netherlands up to 31 May 2022. The mean incubation period was 8.5 days, ranging from 4.2 to 17.3 days (5th to 95th percentiles). These findings underpin 21 days for monitoring or quarantining of case contacts.

[12] WHO: vaccine sharing
Date: Wed 15 Jun 2022
Source: AP News [edited]
https://apnews.com/article/covid-health-pandemics-united-nations-world-organization-a4848839d86d2d08100000d918b6bd0d


The World Health Organization said it's creating a new vaccine-sharing mechanism to stop the outbreak of monkeypox in more than 30 countries beyond Africa. The move could result in the UN health agency distributing scarce vaccine doses to rich countries that can otherwise afford them.

To some health experts, the initiative potentially misses the opportunity to control monkeypox virus in the African countries where it's infected people for decades, serving as another example of the inequity in vaccine distribution seen during the coronavirus pandemic.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the agency is developing an initiative for "fair access" to vaccines and treatments that it hopes will be ready within weeks. The mechanism was proposed shortly after Britain, Canada, France, Germany, the United States and other countries reported hundreds of monkeypox cases last month [May 2022].

WHO has described the outbreak as "unusual" and said the virus' continuing spread was worrying enough to convene its expert committee next week to decide if monkeypox should be declared a global emergency.

Vaccines for smallpox, a related disease, are thought to be about 85% effective against monkeypox. WHO's Europe director, Dr. Hans Kluge, said Wednesday [15 Jun 2022] he was concerned by the scramble by some rich countries to buy more vaccines without talk of buying supplies for Africa.

Kluge urged governments "to approach monkeypox without repeating the mistakes of the pandemic." Still, he did not discount the possibility that countries like Britain, which currently has the biggest outbreak beyond Africa, might receive vaccines through WHO.

He said the program was being created for all countries and that vaccines would largely be dispensed based on their epidemiological needs. "Europe remains the epicenter of this escalating outbreak, with 25 countries reporting more than 1500 cases, or 85% of the global total," Kluge noted.

Some African experts questioned why the UN health agency has never proposed using vaccines in central and West Africa, where the disease is endemic. "The place to start any vaccination should be Africa and not elsewhere," Dr. Ahmed Ogwell, acting director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.

He said the lack of any vaccines to counter monkeypox on the continent, where more than 1500 suspected cases and 72 deaths have been reported this year [2022], was a more critical concern than the clusters of mostly mild disease being reported in rich countries.

"This is an extension of the inequity that we saw during COVID," said Ifeanyi Nsofor, a Nigerian infectious diseases physician and consultant at the communications agency Upswell. "We have had hundreds of monkeypox cases in Nigeria from 2017 until now and we're just dealing with it on our own," he said. "Nobody has discussed when there might be vaccines available for Africa."

After the coronavirus pandemic exploded in 2020, global health agencies rushed to set up COVAX, a UN-backed effort to distribute COVID-19 vaccines. But rich countries bought up most of the world's supply, and the COVAX program missed multiple targets to share doses with the world's poor.

To date, only about 17% of people in poorer countries have received a single dose of coronavirus vaccine. Some experts fear the same thing could happen with monkeypox. "Just like with COVID, there is no clear path for how poorer countries will be able to get vaccines," Brook Baker, a Northeastern University law professor who specializes in access to medicines, said.

He warned that as WHO attempts to determine how many vaccine doses are available, rich countries that previously promised doses might not cooperate. "Rich countries will protect themselves while people in the global south die," Baker predicted.

On Monday [13 Jun 2022], advocacy group Public Citizen sent a letter to the White House, asking if the Biden administration would release the 20 million smallpox vaccines the United States pledged in 2004 for WHO's use in the event of an emergency, like a biological attack.

Asked about the commitment, a senior US official said the government was "exploring all options" to further their efforts to stop monkeypox within the United States and globally. The official said the United States had returned more than 200 000 doses of a smallpox vaccine to the manufacturer so they would be available to others. The official declined to say if the United States considers the current monkeypox outbreak an emergency that warrants the release of the 20 million pledged vaccines.

According to the health data and analytics firm Airfinity, the United States has at least 1.4 million doses of vaccine and has ordered another 13 million. To date, the United States has reported 72 monkeypox cases.

Francois Balloux, an infectious diseases expert at University College London, said vaccination efforts in rich countries should prompt an overhaul of future monkeypox response strategies in Africa. "It really should be a priority to vaccinate people in Africa, where there is a nastier strain that has actually killed people," he said, adding that more monkeypox spillovers were likely in the future. "Whatever vaccination happens in Europe, that is not going to solve the problem," Balloux said.

[13] WHO: virus name change

Source: Panorama [edited]
https://www.panorama.am/en/news/2022/06/15/WHO-monkeypox/2695611


The World Health Organization (WHO) says it is working with experts to officially rename monkeypox, amid concerns over stigma and racism around the "discriminatory" name of the virus, ABC News reports.

WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced on Tuesday morning [14 Jun 2022] that the organisation was "working with partners and experts from around the world on changing the name of monkeypox virus, its clades [strains] and the disease it causes." Mr Ghebreyesus said the WHO would make announcements about the new names as soon as possible.

It comes after more than 30 scientists wrote last week about the "urgent need for a non-discriminatory and non-stigmatising" name for the virus and the disease it causes. Continued reference to the virus as African is both inaccurate and discriminatory, they said.
