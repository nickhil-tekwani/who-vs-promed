Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 12 / 7 / 0 / 0 / 12
Affected population: farm with 12 bovines (11 fattening young bulls and a cow). Clinical signs in some of the animals: fever, lameness, stomatitis, lingual lesions and salivation.

[The introduction of FMDV-A into Algeria is concerning for the country and its neighbors, since the relevant animal populations are considered to be fully susceptible. The recent vaccinations in Maghreb countries, including Algeria, targeted FMDV-O. According to the WRLFMD Algeria web-page, FMDV-A was last reported there in 1977 (see http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/africa/alg.htm).
Algeria belongs to FMD "Pool 3" (West Eurasia & Middle East), while bordering also countries belonging to "Pool 5" (West-Central Africa). Strains invading Algeria are generally expected to originate in one of those 2 pools.

A map showing the FMD pools is available on page 5 of the most recent FAO/EU/EUFMD's global monthly situation report, February 2017 (published [31 Mar 2017] and available at http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2017/Feb2017.pdf). The said report presents the following conjectured circulating FMDV serotype A lineages in pools 3 and 5.

1. Pool 3 (West Eurasia & Middle East):

-A/ASIA/Iran-05 (from AFG-07, HER 10, SIS-10/12, SIS-, FAR-09/11 and BAR-08 sub-lineages)
-A/Asia/G-VII (recent incursion from South Asia)
-A/ASIA/Sea-97
-A/ASIA/Sindh-08
-A/AFRICA/G-IV (detected also in Iran in 2016)
-Asia-1 (Sindh-08 lineage).

2. Pool 5

A/AFRICA/G-IV (Cameroon).

Noteworthy, 2 North-African countries, Libya and Egypt, are considered to belong to 2 pools, namely Pool 3 and Pool 4 (Eastern Africa). A total of 2 FMDV-A lineages have recently been reported from countries of pool 4, namely A/AFRICA/G-VII (Ethiopia) and A/AFRICA/G-1 (Kenya).

Genotyping of the new strain in Algeria is in urgent need for the choice of the most appropriate vaccine strain. - Mod.AS
