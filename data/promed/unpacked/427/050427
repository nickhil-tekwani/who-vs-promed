News
Change in coordination of the response to Ebola virus disease
-------------------------------------------------------------
- A communiqu√© of the Presidency of the Republic announced this Sat 20 Jul 2019, the establishment of a technical secretariat under the direct supervision of the Head of State to coordinate the response against EVD in North Kivu and in Ituri. This technical secretariat is headed by Professor Jean-Jacques Muyembe, who was also chairman of the laboratory committee in coordinating the current response since August 2018.
- Following the change and out of respect for the new arrangements, the Minister of Health, Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga, submitted his resignation to give the new team appointed by the Presidency every chance of success. In his letter of resignation, he recalled that the uniqueness of the government's position in the face of the epidemic was important to avoid creating harmful confusion for the rest of the response. Dr Oly Ilunga Kalenga's resignation letter is available at https://gallery.mailchimp.com/89e5755d2cca4840b1af93176/files/e9c71814-0105-4c81-9288-b5e938bec2b2/lettre_de_demission_MSP_22_juil_2019_0_.pdf [in French].
- As a result, all communications related to the response will now be managed directly by the Presidency. Thus, this newsletter is the LAST newsletter on the Ebola outbreak sent by the press team of the Ministry of Health. Thank you for having followed us all these months.

Figures of the response
-----------------------
- 171 052 vaccinated persons;
- the only vaccine to be used in this outbreak is the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine, manufactured by the pharmaceutical group Merck, following approval by the Ethics Committee in its decision of 19 May 2018;
- 77 196 601 people under control;
- 80 entry points (PoE) and operational health checkpoints (OHC);
- 140 contaminated health workers: 2 health workers are among the new confirmed cases of Beni (unvaccinated) and Oicha (unknown vaccination status);
- the cumulative number of confirmed/probable cases among health workers is 140 (5% of all confirmed/probable cases) including 41 deaths.

External situation report 51 - data as reported by 21 Jul 2019
--------------------------------------------------------------
The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces in Democratic Republic of the Congo continues.

Since our last external situation report (data reported by 14 Jul 2019), 91 new confirmed EVD cases with an additional 75 deaths have been reported across the 2 affected provinces. We continue to observe sustained local transmission with a large number of cases in Beni Health Zone. In addition, cases continue to be exported from Beni to other health zones via the movement of cases and their contacts.

Intensive follow-up of contacts of the confirmed case who arrived in Goma on 14 Jul 2019 continues. 19 health workers were deployed from other posts to Goma to provide support in the response to this case. Rumours of contacts travelling to Bukavu and South Kivu have been investigated and ruled out by response teams. No new cases have been reported in Goma to date. There are currently no confirmed cases of EVD outside of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

On 17 Jul 2019, the Director-General convened the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (IHR) to review the situation on the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Director-General accepted the Emergency Committee's recommendation that the outbreak constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC).

Overall, EVD case incidence rates remained largely unchanged in the past week (Figure 1). In last 21 days, 65 health areas within 18 health zones reported new cases, representing 16% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 254 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Beni (52%, n=133), Mabalako (11%, n=28), Mandima (9%, n=22), and Katwa (7%, n=18) which are the main active areas in the outbreak.

As of 21 Jul 2019, a total of 2592 EVD cases, including 2498 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1743 death were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1649 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2501 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 56% (1458) were female, and 28% (737) were children aged less than 18 years. The cumulative number of health workers affected is 140 (5% of total cases).

- Fri 19 Jul 2019. Why declaring Ebola a public health emergency isn't a silver bullet
[The Conversation, abridged, edited]
http://theconversation.com/why-declaring-ebola-a-public-health-emergency-isnt-a-silver-bullet-120685


[The reason for declaring a PHEIC] was that the number of cases had increased from 2071 to 2522. Even though the mortality rate had remained at 67%, 3 new cases were detected in Uganda. In addition, a case of Ebola was diagnosed in Goma, a city of almost 2 million that is a busy entry point for the DRC. The town sits on the Rwandan border.

The expected impact of the decision is that more funding will be raised for the response teams in the field as international support is stepped up. It will also give the DRC's Ministry of Health more flexibility to ensure response teams reach even the remotest areas. More means are needed to ensure that teams are able to engage communities. Part of this is ensuring they have the logistics to access them, especially in the most remote places.

The vaccine hasn't stopped the spread of the disease, although it has contributed to controlling it. The introduction of a 2nd vaccine through a clinical trial would support the response, especially in the neighbouring regions of North Kivu, where no cases have been reported.

The other factor holding back efforts to eliminate the outbreak has been the increasing number of attacks on personnel in the area. The violence is also getting in the way of engaging with communities, a major part of any Ebola response.

The DRC has also been facing challenges in getting the funds it needs to manage the response efficiently.

[4] Vaccine: preliminary data
Date: Sun 21 Jul 2019
Source: The Hindu [abridged, edited]
https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/ebola-vaccine-tested-during-epidemic-saves-lives-in-congo/article28620893.ece


The WHO noted that the preliminary data suggest that the vaccine used during the current outbreaks in Congo was 97.5% efficacious in preventing Ebola infection.

Of the 94 000 people who were vaccinated during the current outbreaks, only 71 developed the disease. Of the 71, only 15 developed symptoms 10 or more days after vaccination. The majority -- 57 individuals -- displayed symptoms within nine days of vaccination, before the vaccine could fully protect them. It had become clear during the trials that the vaccine needed 10 days to fully protect vaccinated individuals.

There were only 9 deaths among the 57 people who developed the disease before the vaccine could be fully protective. In comparison, no deaths were reported among people who developed the disease more than 10 days post vaccination.

More importantly, 54 of the 71 Ebola cases were in high-risk contacts, and only 2 cases were among the contacts of contacts, thus underlining the effectiveness of the ring vaccination strategy in preventing the spread of the disease.

In order to cut the transmission chain, SAGE [Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization] recommended the inclusion of a 3rd ring of contacts to be vaccinated. Currently available evidence does not support mass immunisation of the population.

In May 2019, SAGE recommended that the currently administered dose (1 ml) can be halved to match the dose tested in phase-3 trial in Guinea to protect health-care workers, contacts and contacts of contacts. People in the third ring could be given one-fifth the current dose. Instead of 10, it would take 28 days for the vaccine to confer protection when 1/5 of the current dose is used. But it would provide a "reasonable risk-benefit trade-off for protection," SAGE noted.

- Minister has blocked use of back-up J&J vaccine
- Ministry cedes responsibility for controlling outbreak
- President appoints new team led by biomedics chief
- Ebola outbreak is second deadliest in history

Congo's health minister resigned on Mon [22 Jul] after being stripped of responsibility for managing the country's Ebola outbreak, potentially paving the way for the introduction of a 2nd vaccine to contain the spreading epidemic.

Oly Ilunga has overseen Democratic Republic of Congo's near year-long response to what is the 2nd deadliest Ebola outbreak in history.

President Felix Tshisekedi on [Sat 20 Jul 2019] appointed a team led by Jean-Jacques Muyembe, the head of Congo's biomedical research institute, to coordinate the government's response in Ilunga's place.

In his resignation letter, the minister criticised pressure by unnamed "actors" to deploy the 2nd vaccine, manufactured by Johnson & Johnson and backed by the WHO.

The Ebola emergency in the Democratic Republic of Congo will require about 3 times more money than currently provided, the United Nations agency leading the public health response said. The World Health Organization estimates USD 324 million is needed to fund its response and preparedness in the Africa region over the next 6 months. Additional funds will be required to support other functions outside the WHO's remit to help stop transmission of the deadly hemorrhagic virus, the Geneva-based agency said in an email [Tue 23 Jul 2019]."

"[In his resignation letter, Minister Ilunga] said another flashpoint was outside pressure to introduce a new experimental vaccine. The country has deployed hundreds of thousands of doses of a vaccine by Merck, a German pharmaceutical company. The World Health Organization (WHO) and others have encouraged the DRC to use another vaccine by Johnson & Johnson, an American company. ... It's unclear if the new task force will change the DRC's position on the second vaccine."

[Allen Lenoir, MD <alenoir165@aol.com> has sent the following clarification (see also in 20190726.6588573): "Merck & Co., Inc., d.b.a. Merck Sharp & Dohme outside the United States and Canada, is an American multinational pharmaceutical company and not a German pharmaceutical company as mistakenly reported. Merck says it is moving production of the vaccine from the US to a new plant in Germany that has not yet gained regulatory approval to ramp up manufacturing. This may have been the source of the error in the report.

Johnson & Johnson also is an American company.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract. Use of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based Ebola virus vaccine during outbreaks and the potential use of a similar VSV-based Lassa virus vaccine has raised questions about the vaccines' stability should the cold chain fail. We demonstrated that current cold chain conditions might tolerate significant variances without affecting efficacy.

[The Conversation, abridged, edited]

[Byline: Julia Smith]

Gender matters in responding to major disease outbreaks like Ebola
------------------------------------------------------------------
In efforts to contain the outbreak the link between politics and health are being highlighted. But there's a crucial aspect that's rarely mentioned -- how gender inequities fuel and exacerbate outbreaks.

This suggests that lessons from past responses are being ignored.

The gender dimensions of outbreaks are both physical and socially constructed. Some diseases by their nature affect the sexes differently. For example, the Zika virus typically results in a relatively mild infection but is particularly risky during pregnancy, as it is linked to birth defects. Gender roles also affected how outbreaks are experienced. During almost all outbreaks, women provide the majority of care to the ill voluntarily in their homes at great risk and cost to themselves.

Global health policy has been slow to recognise the gender dimensions of outbreaks. During the West African Ebola outbreak, from 2014 to 2016, Sophie Harman, a professor from Queen Mary University of London, wrote that "gender and women are conspicuously invisible at every point in the international response to the outbreak."
