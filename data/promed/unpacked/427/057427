[A health warning has been issued after 3 children in Sydney became ill after using eyeliner almost entirely made of lead, imported from Pakistan and sold in stores in the Indian and Pakistani communities in Australia.]

The Hashmi Kohl branded product was 84 per cent lead and also contained high levels of dangerous metals including arsenic, cadmium, chromium, and mercury.

NSW [New South Wales] Better Regulation Minister Matt Kean said the toxic ingredients were revealed after lab testing by authorities.

"Some of the product packaging even specifically states no lead is present, which is a total disgrace," Mr Kean said in a statement.

The children, from the same family, fell ill after using the Pakistan-made products.

Doctors found elevated lead levels in their blood, prompting NSW Fair Trading investigation and referral to Border Force for investigation.

Businesses supplying products disobeying the mandatory standard can be punished with fines of up to AUD 1.1 million [abut USD 820 000].

The products, mostly sold in shops selling Indian and Pakistani goods, are banned for sale in the United States.

US regulators also have an import alert for all kohl eye cosmetics because they commonly have elevated lead levels and carry false labels.

[Kohl is an ancient eye cosmetic, traditionally made by grinding stibnite for similar purposes to charcoal used in mascara. Kohl is a mineral that the US FDA has never approved for cosmetic use in the USA, because the way it is mined means it always contains lead; consequently, in the USA it refers only to a color. While lead is known to be toxic if ingested, it can also cause blindness in those affected. Most often, lead causes extremely early onset of cataracts, which may lead to blindness. In some cultures, this Kohl eyeliner is worn by men and women, but the product (containing lead) causes more blindness in men than in women. Whether this is due to gender sensitivity or that more males than females wear it has not been conclusively proven. Lead may be adsorbed by the conjunctiva of the eye resulting in systemic poisoning. Clinical signs may include gastric upset (diarrhea, constipation, poor appetite, or weight loss), memory problems, headaches, anemia, and seizures. Visual disturbance may be present or may progress gradually. Generally, this includes vision as a result of central scotoma, caused by toxic optic neuritis and even by cataracts occurring at very early ages. Especially in children, the nervous system may be adversely affected.

The offending lead containing substance should be removed or remove the individual from the location of exposure. In the case of the eyeliner, it should be removed and not reapplied. A chelator may be used to bind or chelate the lead. The chelating agents most often used for treatment of lead poisoning are edetate disodium calcium (CaNa2EDTA), dimercaprol (BAL), which are injected, and succimer and d-penicillamine, which are administered orally. Chelation therapy is used in cases of acute lead poisoning severe poisoning, and encephalopathy.

This product should be removed from the shelves of all retail markets to protect public health. - Mod.TG
