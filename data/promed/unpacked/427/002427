One suspect in the illegal chemical dumping activities in Sungai Kim Kim in Pasir Gudang here last Thursday [7 Mar 2019] is expected to be charged tomorrow [Thu 14 Mar 2019].

Energy, science, technology, environment and climate change minister Yeo Bee Yin said the Department of Environment (DoE) had completed the investigation paper on the case and submitted it to the public prosecutor's office today [Wed 13 Mar 2019].

"The suspect, one of the 3 arrested earlier this week, is the owner of a tyre-recycling plant in Kulai. He will be charged under Section 34B of the Environmental Quality Act," said Yeo.

She said the suspect would face more charges under the Penal Code or other laws.

"I have spoken with the attorney general Tommy Thomas about this. We will charge the suspect with one charge 1st, and when we have gathered more evidence, we could charge him under other acts," Yeo said at a press conference after attending a briefing on the issue by Johor DoE. Also present was Johor DoE director Datuk Dr Muhammad Ezzani Mat Salleh.

Yeo said the department did not discount the possibility more suspects would be arrested in the case. "DoE will continue to investigate. We have identified 8 chemical compounds in the samples taken from the substances dumped in the river. We will use this (evidence) to cross check with the 252 factories in the area to find out if they match with any of the substances," said Yeo.

The chemical compounds that have been identified are methane, hydrogen chloride, acrylonitrile, acrolein, benzene, toulene, xylene, and limonene.

Yeo said DoE would also install air-quality meters to ascertain air-quality levels in the area. "The meters will be installed at different altitudes so that we can accurately measure the air quality."

She said the ministry's main concern now was to complete the cleaning process at the site as soon as possible. "We have already appointed a contractor for the cleaning works," said Yeo.

When asked how long the process would take, Yeo said she would have more details following a state disaster management committee meeting later this afternoon [13 Mar 2019].

The pollution in Sungai Kim Kim had forced a total of 5848 people to seek treatment after inhaling toxic fumes. Health minister Datuk Seri Dr Dzulkefly Ahmad said out of the total number, 951 were warded, and 25 ended up in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) after inhaling toxic fumes emitted from chemical waste dumped into Sungai Kim Kim on [Thu 7 Mar 2019]. The rest (4872) were given outpatient treatment.

"We have also deployed 262 ministry staff to address the health issues triggered by the illegal dumping of chemicals," he told reporters after the launch of the World Oral Health Day today [Wed 20 Mar 2019].

He added things had returned to normal in Pasir Gudang, and the Health Ministry had since closed its ground command centre as of 9:00 a.m. today [20 Mar 2019]. Dr Dzulkefly said the ministry wanted the culprits responsible in the illegal dumping of chemical waste to be brought to justice as soon as possible.

The toxic pollution had also forced the closure of all 111 schools in Pasir Gudang until the school break.

Police have so far arrested 9 men: 2 in Johor and 7 outside the state. All 9 had been remanded for 6 days since Monday [18 Mar 2019] to facilitate the investigation.

["Chemicals are part of our daily life. All living and inanimate matter is made up of chemicals, and virtually every manufactured product involves the use of chemicals. Many chemicals can, when properly used, significantly contribute to the improvement of our quality of life, health, and well-being. But other chemicals are highly hazardous and can negatively affect our health and environment when improperly managed."

WHO indicates that the following 10 chemicals are of major public health concern:
- Air pollution
- Arsenic
- Asbestos
- Benzene
- Cadmium
- Dioxin and dioxin-like substances
- Inadequate or excess fluoride
- Lead
- Mercury
- Highly hazardous pesticides

From article [1] above, the chemical compounds that have been identified are methane, hydrogen chloride, acrylonitrile, acrolein, benzene, toulene, xylene, and limonene. Clearly there is air pollution caused by these chemicals, and at least one of them is on the WHO's top 10 list.

However, if this dumping occurred at a river site, (according to article [1]), there may be more issues because of water contamination and other health problems. This situation may not be over.

We are not told the levels of any of the identified chemicals or if there were other chemicals not currently identified. Having almost 6000 people seek medical help is a significant exposure. We wish them all well. - Mod.TG
