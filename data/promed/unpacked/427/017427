Commercial fishermen along the south west Florida coast are reporting a
massive dead zone almost devoid of marine life in an area of the Gulf of
Mexico, traditionally known as a rich fishing ground. They've dubbed it
"black water", and have called local, state, and national government
agencies to investigate.
Scientists who have heard of the phenomenon say they need answers too."It's
killed a lot of the bottom because recently a lot of little bottom plants
are coming to the surface dead and rotten out in the Gulf," said Tim
Daniels, 58, a Marathon Key fish-spotting pilot who has been flying over
the Gulf for more than 20 years. Experienced fishermen say they've often
seen red tide but they've never seen anything like this "it doesn't have a
foul smell, it isn't red tide and it isn't oil. They describe it as viscous
and slimy water with what looks like spider webs in it."
First sighted in January, the mass of black-colored water reached from 20
miles north of Marathon Key halfway to Naples. It stretched west almost 20
miles into the Gulf of Mexico.
Though somewhat smaller now than descriptions from January, the mass of
water is still quite large and is moving into the Florida Keys National
Marine Sanctuary, a 2800 square-mile sanctuary adjacent to the Keys, which
is the largest coral reef in the United States. It includes the productive
waters of Florida Bay, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean. Part of
the ecosystem is an extensive nursery, feeding, and breeding ground,
supporting a variety of marine species and a multimillion dollar fishing
industry bringing in almost 20 million pounds of seafood each year.
Billy Causey, superintendent of the sanctuary, told the Naples Daily News
recently that there is real concern in the scientific community about the
overall health of the Gulf. Causey said contributing to the problems
afflicting the shallow body is global warming, extended periods when the
Gulf waters aren't cooling in the winter, and the growing impact of human
activity along coastlines. Those problems, beginning in the early 1980s,
include more frequent and longer lasting coral bleaching events that by
1990 were affecting stouter coral reefs closer to shore and more adapted to
wide temperature swings.
"There are places that are still beautiful but the shallow reefs would make
you cry," said Causey, a Keys diver since the 1950s. Scientists with Mote
Marine Laboratory based in Sarasota said they are aware of the black water
phenomenon but have not yet been able to test water samples. Mote is
willing to send out testing kits to fishermen who might encounter the black
water zone but, in the absence of a kit, fishermen could put a sample in a
clean bottle and keep it in a cool, dark place until they could get it to a
lab.
Daniels said he first noticed the black water when he went out in
mid-January, ahead of kingfish season, to see what fishermen had in store
for 2002. When he was flying over water that was 50 feet deep and north of
the Keys, Daniels began to notice a change in the water color. When pilots
from the air see boats move through a red tide zone, they often cut the
reddish or brownish water to reveal green below. That doesn't occur in the
black water. "This (dark) stuff goes all the way to the bottom," Richardson
said. Boats that have 4 to 5 feet of hull below the surface cut through 35
to 40 feet of water and leave nothing but the same black water in their
wakes. It's the same at depths of 15 feet, he said.
Along with the newly discovered black water and coral bleaching, there have
been other problems with the Gulf having been documented for years. They
include a New Jersey-sized dead zone coming off the Mississippi River
outlet to the Gulf that consumes a larger area each summer. There are
incidences of a contamination known as fibro papilloma [any information
about this condition? - Mod.SH] in green turtles that live in Florida Bay.
There are other problems in shrimp and an entire marine ecosystem appears
to be sick.
