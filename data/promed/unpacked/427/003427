Aerial Spraying - Historical Information
----------------------------------------
The presumed effectiveness of aerial spraying can be found in studies
conducted in the 1960s. As a member of the Virology Division, Bureau of
Laboratories, at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), I was part of a
cooperative program between the CDC, the Texas State Health Department and
the Dallas Health Department to investigate and control an urban epidemic
of St. Louis encephalitis in Dallas in 1966. During this epidemic, ultra
low volume (ULV) malathion was used for the first time to control such an
outbreak by aerial spraying. The mosquito vector control program consisted
of ULV application of 95% malathion at the rate of approximately 225 ml per
hectare by low-flying US Air Force C-123 Globemaster aircraft. A total of
approximately 1927 km2 of Dallas city and county were sprayed over 7 days
in the early morning hours. I recall witnessing a "bugless" city during
that interval. As described in the publications listed below, the program
was highly effective in killing adult mosquitoes, but did not generally
reduce the existing larval mosquito population.
The prime thrust during an epidemic such as this is to eliminate the
infected adult mosquitoes as quickly as possible. Spraying is generally
carried out with supplemental ground control with fogging. The efficacy of
such a program on human cases is difficult to accurately evaluate. However,
after the aerial spraying, there was a marked fall in the number of
mosquito vectors and in their infection rate, which was felt to have
effectively reduced vector transmission. While virus activity was reduced
significantly, it was not entirely eliminated. However, immediately after
spraying, the resting site counts dropped to near zero for about a week. It
could be assumed that both infected and non-infected vector mosquitoes were
reduced enough to temporarily reduce transmission to an ineffectual level.
The hypothesis is that by the time surviving mosquitoes reemerge, viremia
in infected birds will have either disappeared or declined to the point
that the infection cycle might be broken. Full details of the program can
be found in:
