The menace of encephalitis continues unabated in eastern Uttar Pradesh as 3 more children succumbed to the disease at BRD Medical College Hospital, official sources said on Wednesday [25 Dec 2013].

With these deaths, which took place during the last 24 hours, the toll has reached 640 this year [2013].

Sources in the office of Additional Director (Health) said all 3 deaths occurred at BRD Medical College Hospital.

The deceased hailed one each from Gorakhpur, Kushinagar [both in Uttar Pradesh state] and an adjacent area in Bihar [state], they said, adding, the patients were admitted to the medical college hospital during the last 24 hours while 46 patients are undergoing treatment.

Sources said that this year [2013] as many as 3008 encephalitis patients were admitted to different government hospitals of eastern region, of which 640 died.

The disease causes death in 33 per cent of cases, while over 50 per cent of patients suffer from various forms of mental and physical disabilities, they said.

The disease is caused due to mosquito bite [that transmutes Japanese encephalitis virus] or consumption of contaminated water.

Central and state agencies are continuously conducting awareness campaigns on sanitation and safe drinking water.

The official said 3 rounds of vaccination against Japanese encephalitis (JE) for children up to 15 years have also been conducted, adding that the move has [caused JE cases to go down by 15 per cent].

[As noted in previous comments, reports of viral encephalitis in Uttar Pradesh state provide no indication of the proportion of these cases due to Japanese encephalitis virus infections or to other, undetermined causes. In previous reports, some have been diagnosed as due to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections and others associated with contaminated water, suggesting enterovirus infections. The massive Japanese encephalitis virus vaccination campaigns in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states has resulted in a significant reduction in cases due to infection with that virus.

The cause of the majority of the AES (acute encephalitis syndrome) cases remains undiagnosed. A study of encephalitis in Udorn, Thailand indicated that the histopathologic features from autopsies conducted on 40 children were characterized by those findings associated with acute Reye syndrome. The latter report also details the evidence pointing to acute aflatoxin poisoning as the etiology of the condition in Udorn (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20131011.1995836). No autopsy results have been reported for the above cases of acute encephalitis syndrome.

One hopes that the scientists involved in attempting to determine the etiologies of these undiagnosed cases will continue to attempt to find out what is going on, so that scientifically sound preventive measures may be devised and implemented. As mentioned previously, although JEV outbreaks may continue to be prevented through vaccination, preventing enterovirus infections, in the absence of vaccines, requires improvement of sanitation infrastructure to assure adequate human waste disposal and uncontaminated potable water supplies, a very costly effort.
