--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
Background
In 2018-19, Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), the causative agent of Borna disease in horses, sheep, and other domestic mammals, was reported in 5 human patients with severe to fatal encephalitis in Germany. However, information on case frequencies, clinical courses, and detailed epidemiological analyses are still lacking. We report the occurrence of BoDV-1-associated encephalitis in cases submitted to the Institute of Clinical Microbiology and Hygiene, Regensburg University Hospital, Regensburg, Germany, and provide a detailed description of newly identified cases of BoDV-1-induced encephalitis.

Methods
All brain tissues from 56 encephalitis cases from Bavaria, Germany, of putative viral origin (1999-2019), which had been submitted for virological testing upon request of the attending clinician and stored for stepwise diagnostic procedure, were systematically screened for BoDV-1 RNA; 2 additional BoDV-1-positive cases were contributed by other diagnostic centres. Positive results were confirmed by deep sequencing, antigen detection, and determination of BoDV-1-reactive antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Clinical and epidemiological data from infected patients were collected and analysed.

Findings
BoDV-1 RNA and bornavirus-reactive antibodies were detected in 8 newly analysed encephalitis cases and the 1st human BoDV-1 isolate was obtained from an unequivocally confirmed human BoDV-1 infection from the endemic area. Before the onset of fatal disease, 6 of the 8 BoDV-1-positive patients had no record of immunosuppression whereas 2 were immunocompromised after solid organ transplantation. Typical initial symptoms were headache, fever, and confusion, followed by various neurological signs, deep coma, and severe brainstem involvement. Of 9 patients 7 with fatal encephalitis of unclear cause were BoDV-1 positive within one diagnostic centre. BoDV-1 sequence information and epidemiological analyses indicated independent spillover transmissions most likely from the local wild animal reservoir.

Interpretation
BoDV-1 infection has to be considered as a potentially lethal zoonosis in endemic regions with reported spillover infections in horses and sheep. BoDV-1 infection can result in fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised and apparently healthy people. Consequently, all severe encephalitis cases of unclear cause should be tested for bornaviruses especially in endemic regions.

[Borna disease in humans has been documented in Germany before. In 2018 there was a cluster of 4 cases in Germany, 3 of which were related to a solid tissue transplant (see Borna virus - Germany: fatal 20180328.5714656). That report cited zoonotic transmission of BoDV-1 in cluster among variegated squirrels breeders in 2011-2013 in Germany. Plausible routes of transmission were through bites or scratches, but transmission through direct deposition on the mucous membranes or inhalation of particles contaminated by faeces or urine of infected animals was not excluded. The Lancet summary above indicates that epidemiological analysis suggests that transmission to the infected humans was from spillover from the local wild animal reservoir without specifying which wild animals they were.

The bicoloured white-toothed shrew (_Crocidura leucodon_) has been proposed as the animal reservoir of BoDV-1. The routes of transmission from the animal reservoir to humans are unknown and require investigation.

Borna disease virus is an enveloped, spherical, 80 to 100 nm in diameter, non-segmented, single stranded, negative sense RNA viruses of the _Bornavirus_ genus, Bornaviridae family, order Mononegavirales. In the _Mammalian 1 bornavirus_ species, there are 2 viruses: Borna disease virus 1 and 2 (BoDV-1 and BoDV-2); in the _Mammalian 2 bornavirus_ species there is one virus: the variegated squirrel bornavirus 1 (VSBV-1).
