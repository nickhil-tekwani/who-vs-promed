A suspected anthrax disease [outbreak] has broken out in Nakayembe area, killing 3 herds of cattle and leaving 9 people admitted to Nakayembe Rural Health Centre in the newly created Luampa district of Western Province.

In an interview, Kaoma district senior environmental health technologist, Akatama Inambao, confirmed that 9 patients admitted to Nakayembe Rural Health Centre developed localised symptoms of swelling of upper lips, legs, face and heads. He said all the 9 patients were treated by the use of antibiotics and were now out of danger. He has since appealed to the residents of Nakayembe and other surrounding areas where anthrax is rife to avoid eating meat of an anthrax-infested animal as the disease was contagious.

Inambao said a team of health experts had already been dispatched to the area in order to contain the disease and carry out health education meetings on the dangers of eating anthrax-infested meat and its devastating effects.

And Kaoma district agricultural coordinator Aubrey Chanda said the veterinary officers were securing vaccines in order to vaccinate all the cattle in Nakayembe area of Mulwa ward in Luampa district, so that the outbreak does not spread to other areas. Chanda said the department would strengthen awareness programmes to enlighten residents and cattle farmers about the dangers of consuming the anthrax-infested meat. He said any dead animal should be burnt and buried so that the disease could be brought to manageable levels in the district.

[Anthrax is a constant cattle risk in Western Province, with 2 outbreaks and 6 cases in 2006; in 2007, 4 outbreaks, 15 bovine cases, and 6 human cases; 2008, 6 outbreaks, 14 cattle affected; 2009, 3 outbreaks, 5 cattle affected; 2010, 6 outbreaks, 25 cattle affected; 2011, 1 outbreak, 1 cow affected; and in 2012, 2 outbreaks and 2 cattle affected.

From the description, all the human cases in Nakayambe had cutaneous anthrax. One of the social aspects of cattle rearing in Africa is that a poor rural branch of the family will be tasked with rearing the rich family member's cattle. And he has to account for every missing animal when this city relative comes to see how he is getting on. Thus each carcass gets skinned, the head put on the roof, and the meat dried. This makes for severe exposure. Another aspect is that with rural poverty, sick and dead animals get butchered and the meat sold to minimise the financial loss -- which is why cattle vaccination programmes have a high social benefit. Whether the contaminated meat was caught before it was bought by others is not mentioned in this report, so I think we can assume it was not.
