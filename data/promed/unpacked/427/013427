Subject: Emergency Management Notice: Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease
(Viral Hemorrhagic Disease of Rabbits) in Vanderburgh county, Indiana
On 7 Jun 2005, Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease (RHD) was confirmed at a
private residence in Vanderburgh county, Indiana by the Foreign
Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (FADDL) on Plum Island, NY.
Specimens from these rabbits were positive for RHD antigen on ELISA,
electron microscopy, and PCR.
A FAD (Foreign Animal Disease) investigation was initiated on 3 Jun
2005 on a premises that raises rabbits primarily for sale to reptile
owners as a food source for snakes.
The investigation revealed that many of the 200 rabbits on the
premises suddenly died during the past 10 days. Less than a dozen
rabbits had recently been purchased from Kentucky and introduced into
the herd.
An epidemiologic investigation has begun in Kentucky. The remaining
rabbits are quarantined and will be euthanized and disposed of in
accordance to State regulations. Cleaning and disinfection of the
area will follow.
The Indiana epidemiological investigation is ongoing.
APHIS, Veterinary Services (VS), the Indiana Board of Animal Health,
and the Kentucky Department of Agriculture are working together to
address this situation.
VS (Veterinary Services) will assist the affected State in the
euthanasia, cleaning, and disinfection of the premises. VS will
continue to investigate reports of suspect RHD as part of its foreign
animal disease surveillance program and will continue to diagnose
suspect cases at FADDL.
The last known positive RHD case in the US occurred in a captive
exotic animal facility in Flushing, New York in December 2001.
Please forward this information to other Federal, State, and industry
counterparts as necessary.

[This is rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV, family Caliciviridae).
>From the USDA website:
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/fs_ahrabbithd.html>
Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly infectious viral disease
of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_). This is the
species from which all U.S. domestic and commercial rabbits are
derived. American cottontail rabbits and jackrabbits are not
susceptible to infection. RHD is not known to harm humans or other
animals. Once the disease is introduced into a rabbitry, it can
spread rapidly, causing a high percentage of the rabbits to die.
There is no treatment for the disease.
Clinical Signs
--------------
RHD damages the liver, intestines, and lymphatic tissue and causes
terminal massive blood clots. The incubation period is about 24 to
48 hours. Predominantly, young adult and adult rabbits die suddenly
within 6 to 24 hours of the onset of fever with few clinical signs.
Fever may be as high as 105 F (40.5 C) but often is not detected
until rabbits show terminal clinical signs. Most animals appear
depressed or reluctant to move in the final hours and may show a
variety of neurologic signs, including excitement, incoordination,
paddling, and opisthotonos (abnormal position of the head due to
spasms of the muscles at the top and back of the neck). Some
affected rabbits may have a foamy nasal discharge. The death rate
for RHD ranges from 50 to 100 percent.
How RHD Spreads
---------------
RHD is caused by a highly contagious virus. The disease can be
transmitted by contact with infected rabbits, rabbit products,
rodents, and contaminated objects, such as cages, feeders, and
clothing. The virus also may be carried short distances through
moisture in the air. The risk of spread of RHD is higher when
confined rabbits are in close contact with each other. Infected
rabbits that recover may become carriers of the virus and may shed
virus for at least 4 weeks.
Disease Prevention
------------------
To protect against introducing RHD into the U.S. rabbit population,
owners and producers should avoid contact between their rabbits and
imported rabbit meat, pelts, or other possibly contaminated objects
from RHD-affected countries.
To prevent the spread of the disease if it enters the United States,
rabbit owners should prevent contact between healthy rabbits and
infected rabbits and contaminated objects (e.g., cages, feeders, and
clothing). Rabbits that appear healthy can be in the early stage of
disease and later spread the disease. Recovered rabbits also appear
healthy but can be carriers for at least 4 weeks and spread the
disease to other rabbits.
Owners should be cautious and isolate new rabbits and rabbits
returning from shows for at least 5 days. If rabbits were exposed to
RHD, isolation may help prevent spread to other rabbits. Clinical
disease usually will be noticeable within 48 hours of infection.
If RHD is suspected, to prevent spread of the virus, rabbit owners
should clean and disinfect all equipment. After thorough cleaning,
rabbit breeders should use one of the following disinfectant
solutions on equipment to inactivate the virus: 2-percent 1-Stroke
Environ (Steris Corporation, St. Louis, MO), 0.5-percent sodium
hypochlorite, or 10-percent household bleach.
Vaccine
-------
No vaccine is legally available for use in the United States.
Vaccine has been used in other countries. Vaccination often reduces
the number of rabbits dying from RHD, but will not eradicate the
disease. Rabbits vaccinated against RHD may become infected but not
show signs of disease, thereby allowing spread of the virus as a
carrier. - Mod.TG]
