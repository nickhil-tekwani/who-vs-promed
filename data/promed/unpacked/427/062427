[1] Bobcat, human exposure - Arizona

A bobcat that attacked 2 quail hunters Thursday [10 Oct 2013] afternoon near Prescott Valley has tested positive for rabies, Yavapai County Health officials said Friday afternoon.

Arizona Game and Fish Public Information Officer Zen Mocarski reported that the 2 hunters suffered multiple injuries when an adult male bobcat attacked them after they stopped to open a gate while hunting near Coyote Springs subdivision.

The men spotted the bobcat under some bushes and saw it run under their truck. When one of them looked underneath the truck, the bobcat attacked, causing deep lacerations, punctures, and scratches to the man's back, shoulders, arms, and chest, Mocarski said. The man's hunting companion tried to rescue him, and the animal also attacked him, causing less severe injuries. One of the men then shot and killed the bobcat.

The 2 drove to Yavapai Regional Medical Center with the bobcat. Mocarski said hospital personnel immediately treated both men for exposure to rabies. A Game and Fish wildlife manager picked up the bobcat and took it to the Arizona State Public Health Laboratory for testing. Results released about 4:30 p.m. Friday [11 Oct 2013] showed the animal was rabid.

This is the 2nd exposure in Yavapai County in 2013, Mocarski said. The 1st, in early January 2013, was a fox that bit a 14-year-old girl on the heel and ankle in Sedona.

Yavapai County Health Services information states that rabies is an infectious disease that affects the nervous system of humans and other mammals. People and unvaccinated animals may get rabies from the bite of an infected animal, or if saliva from the animal gets directly into a person or animal's eyes, nose, mouth or any break in the skin. Rabies vaccine is given to individuals after exposure to an infected animal to prevent the disease. Rabies is nearly always fatal if not treated after exposure, resulting in an infection.

"Due to increased incidences of rabies in Yavapai County, extra precautions must be taken when enjoying outdoor activities, or when in the presence of wild animals," said Stephen Tullos, health officer for Yavapai County. "Wild animals such as foxes, skunks, bobcats and coyotes are more likely than domestic animals to be infected with rabies. But domestic animals such as cats, dogs, ferrets, and horses can also become infected if they are not properly vaccinated."

Mocarski said people should not approach any wild animals, and residents should keep watch for any unusual behavior from wildlife, such as lethargy, no fear of humans, being overly aggressive, or nocturnal animals being overly active during the day. He urged people to make sure their pets are current on their rabies vaccinations. Those witnessing abnormal behavior should contact Game and Fish or local animal control, he said.

[2] Canine, human exposure - South Carolina

Two adults and 2 children in the Ware Shoals area of Laurens County are being treated for rabies, according to the S.C. Department of Health and Environmental Control. Health officials said they may have been exposed to rabies by a puppy that tested positive for the disease.

"To reduce the risk of getting rabies, we recommend that people avoid wild animals acting tame and tame animals acting wild," said Sue Ferguson of DHEC's Bureau of Environmental Health Services. "About 275 South Carolinians must undergo preventive treatment for rabies every year, with most exposures coming from bites or scratches by a rabid or suspected rabid animal. Wild animals carry the disease most often, but domestic pets can contract rabies as well."

Ferguson said South Carolina requires pet owners to have their pets over 12 weeks old vaccinated against the disease each year.

"This unvaccinated puppy was bitten on the nose by a suspect rabid skunk and died from rabies 10 days later," Ferguson said.

The infected puppy was the 1st domestic pet and the 6th animal to test positive this year [2013] from Laurens County.

[Being on the alert for animals that have unusual behavior is especially important if we are dealing with wildlife, but it is also true for domestic animals including our domesticated farm animals. Most mammals are capable of contracting this terrible virus; while a few, such as rodents, may be less likely to contract it, it is not impossible. Vaccinating your pets, regardless of their size, is important for the protection of your pet and for yourself.
