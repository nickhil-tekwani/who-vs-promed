Tick-borne encephalitis - Vaccine availability
----------------------------------------------
To remind people going to this area: Actually there are [at least two
[inactivated vaccines (Ticovac by Baxter and Encepur by Chiron Behring) -
both highly immunogenic and safe - available and used in Central Europe,
but not approved by the FDA. People at risk should receive active
immunization because passive immunization after the tick bite only provides
questionable protection and - depending on when the shot is administered -
cannot prevent [and may even cause more severe cases of tick-borne
encephalitis. Region-dependent data on attack rates in travelers are not
available.

[Tick-borne encephalitis is caused by two closely related flaviviruses;
Central European encephalitis virus (CEEV) and Russian spring-summer
encephalitis virus (RSSEV). RSSEV is associated with more severe illness
with mortality up to 25% in some outbreaks, whereas mortality from CEEV
infection rarely exceeds 5%. Inactivated vaccines are considered to provide
good protection against infection with CEEV at least. - Mod.CP
