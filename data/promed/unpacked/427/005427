James Cook University researchers have linked native mammals and pets
to human cases of a [potentially] dangerous fever normally associated
with stock animals. Of the 15 cases of Q fever reported nationally in
October 2011, 10 were in Queensland.

Traditionally, people in the meat industry were considered to be at
risk of Q fever, but Townsville researcher Dr Brenda Govan says recent
cases don't have that connection. "The people we've been seeing over
the last few years are people without these risk factors," she said.

Townsville Director of Pathology Dr Robert Norton said the city's
expansion into bushland put more people at new risk. "We've shown that
native mammals can carry these organisms perhaps more than cattle," he
said.

Dr Norton says the fever can be difficult to distinguish from
influenza. "It's a fever that persists, and it presents itself
differently in different people," he said. "About 20 percent of those
affected by Q fever will be hospitalized, and 5 percent will develop
chronic Q fever, which can affect the heart."

An information night is being held for Townsville residents on 1 Dec
2011 at James Cook University. Volunteers will be asked to complete a
questionnaire and provide a blood sample at the event. "We are
interested in taking blood samples from any of the general public who
would like to donate, as we can use the samples as negative controls
in the study, as we don't yet have a good blood test for the disease,
and this is what the study is trying to address," Dr Govan said.

The study aims to find the sources of exposure in patients and to
develop a new diagnostic test to enable a rapid diagnosis of Q fever.
"It can be hard to diagnose, and testing can take weeks to complete; a
new diagnostic test will help to speed up the diagnosis and treatment
of Q fever to decrease the impact of this disease on patients," Dr
Norton said.

Q fever was 1st described in Australia, where this posting originates.
It was called "Query fever" because the causative agent was initially
unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was discovered in
1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to heat and
desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A single
inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in [non-human]
primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was found to be
1.7 organisms (1).

Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals, including
other species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C. burnetii_ does
not usually cause clinical disease in these animals, although abortion
in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_ infection.
Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of infected animals.
Most importantly, during birthing, the organisms are shed in high
numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta. Contact with
contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).

The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long
periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is
associated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are
produced during standard replication (along with the less resistant
large-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).

The Q fever organism is a category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,
although not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by mail
in a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).

Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms
from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried
placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd
animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very
few organisms may be required to cause infection.

Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and
inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of
transmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,
including tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.

An earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK was
tied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol for
at least 0.5 mi (0.8 km).
