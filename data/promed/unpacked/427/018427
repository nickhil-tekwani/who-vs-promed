[No new outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease were officially registered during the past week, even though the local press is echoing a number of suspicions.

The Setif outbreak initially attributed to the SAT1 viral serotype has finally been confirmed as being due to serotype A by the FAO/OIE Reference Laboratory in Brescia, Italy. - Mod.AB

Subscribers are referred to the Algeria page of the WRLFMD, where the genotyping results of sequences from 5 FMDV-A strains identified in samples from 5 Algerian cattle have already been published. This relates to 3 samples collected on [24 Mar 2017] from cattle in Ouled Souid, Zemmoura, Relizane and 2 samples collected from cattle on [2 Apr 2017] in Boussena, Ouzna, Medea. The sequencing was applied by the FMD reference laboratory in Brescia, Italy. Their respective genotyping results are presented in tables showing their identity rate to the most closely related sequences from FMDV-A Africa G-IV strains (Algeria and Nigeria), as well as to 10 most closely related prototype sequences. The tables are available at http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2017/WRLMEG-2017-00028-Algeria-A-current-v2.pdf. A dendogram is included as well.

According to the data on WRLFMD genotyping pages (date of access [22 Apr 2017]), 3 additional samples from Algeria have been received at Pirbright on [18 Apr 2017]. The publication of their genotyping results is "pending". It may be assumed (but in need of confirmation) that these samples were collected in Setif.

Since 2011, virus strains of FMDV-A, topotype Africa, lineage G-IV have reportedly been reported from Sudan, Egypt, Nigeria, Cameroun and Ethiopia. According to vaccine matching tests carried out by the WRLFMD in 2016, a recent Egyptian FMDV-A field isolate (A/EGY/3/2016), belonging to the said genotype A/AFRICA/G-IV, obtained good matching results with the vaccine strain A/Eri 98 but not with A Iran 2005, ATUR 20/06 and A22IRQ. See 'Egypt" on page 15 of http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2016/October_2016.pdf.

However the said results are not necessarily applicable to the recent Algerian FMDV-A Africa G-IV strain, and vaccine matching tests of the Algerian strain are urgently needed.

Hopefully, matching vaccines, in case indicated, will be found in vaccine-banks and/or be commercially available. This is essential for Algeria, as well as for its neighbors.

The use of heterogeneous vaccine strains, not capable to protect the naive animal population, in Algeria may negatively affect the vital trust and cooperation of animal owners during future vaccinations. So far, clinical FMD cases in Algeria have been reported only in cattle. The situation in small ruminants remains to be carefully checked. - Mod.AS
