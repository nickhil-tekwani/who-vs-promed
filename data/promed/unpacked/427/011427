Indonesian boy sick with bird flu
---------------------------------
JAKARTA: A 3 year old Indonesian boy has tested positive for bird flu, but
his life in not in danger, a Health Ministry official said on Monday [29
Oct 2007]. The boy, from Tangerang, west of the capital Jakarta, lives in
the same neighborhood as a 5 year old girl who died of bird flu last week,
said I Nyoman Kandun, the Health Ministry's director for communicable
disease control. The [5 year old] girl's death was Indonesia's 89th
fatality from the H5N1 bird flu virus.

The boy is suffering only minor symptoms of flu and is being treated at
Sulianti Saroso hospital, Jakarta's main bird flu treatment centre, Kandun
said. Chickens are known to have died in the two children's neighborhood.
Contact with sick fowl is the most common way for humans to contract the
deadly H5N1 strain of the virus.

Bird flu is endemic in bird populations in most parts of Indonesia, where
millions of backyard chickens live in close proximity with humans.
Indonesia, which has now had 111 confirmed cases [that is, including the 3
year old boy in Tangerang - Mod.CP] of the disease in humans, has suffered
more fatalities than any other country. Excluding the latest case, there
have been 204 deaths and 332 cases globally since 2003, according to World
Health Organization (WHO) data. [The WHO Table of confirmed human cases of
H5N1 avian influenza, updated to 25 Oct 2007, can be consulted at

cases_table_2007_10_25/en/index.html>.

[WHO confirmation is awaited. If comfirmed, this 3 year old child will
become the 111th human case of H5N1 avian influenza virus infection in
Indonesia. It will be important to investigate fully any potential linkage
between this case and the death of the 5 year old girl as a result of H5N1
virus infection in the same locality a few days earlier.
