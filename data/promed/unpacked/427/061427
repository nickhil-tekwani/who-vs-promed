A former Georgetown University [Washington, DC, USA] student has pleaded guilty to having the toxin ricin in his dorm room. 19-year-old [DM] of Bethesda, Maryland, pleaded guilty to unregistered possession of a biological agent or toxin Monday [15 Sep 2014] in federal court in Washington.

If the court accepts a plea deal, [DM] will be sentenced to between 1 and 2 years in prison on 10 Nov 2014.
