According to Childs, J.E., et al, 1997. Surveillance and spatiotemporal
associations of rabies in rodents and lagomorphs in the United States,
1985-1994, J Wildlife Dis, 33(1), pp 20-27: there was one laboratory
confirmed rabid prairie dog in the US during the period evaluated,
occurring in 1986.

>>But what might explain these prairie rodents appearing to be "sick" at
this time?<<
I'm not familiar with the distribution of endemic _Francisella_ in Texas,
but here in California we would certainly add tularemia to the list of
diseases to consider if the child begins to show signs of disease during
the observation period after contact with a "sick" prairie dog.

Despite the fact that there are about 20 cases of human _Y. pestis_
reported to CDC each year, preemptive therapy in this case would be
challenging. The only drugs recommended for same are tetracycline (serious
side effects in prepubescent children) and chloramphenicol. The early
symptoms of plague can be mistaken for flu, so the parents should be
alerted to be on the lookout for same, and promptly get child to care if
they occur. Sick prairie dogs are always problematic, and this exposure is
of concern from the information I have.

[Curious children should always be warned of other varmints living in and
around prairie dog (& gopher) holes, starting with snakes, spiders, and
scorpions. Of course that will only increase their interest in some
instances. - Mod.MHJ
