[HPAI H5N8 virus, one of the HPAI H5Nx reassortants of the Asian HPAI H5N1, has spread to many regions of the Old World. In 2016, the virus appeared in the Indian subcontinent infecting free-ranging wild birds; later that year it caused outbreaks in poultry and has remained since then, appearing occasionally infecting poultry or wild birds. - Mod.PMB
