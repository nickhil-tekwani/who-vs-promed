BOTULINUM TOXIN, LABORATORY EXPOSURE - USA (MASSACHUSETTS) (02)

According to a statement released yesterday, 7 Apr 2006, by the
school, none of the 5 employees experienced any symptoms related to
possible botulinum exposure. The laboratory is back to normal
operations, and employee training will be reinforced, the school
said. School officials said there was never a spill or release of the
toxin beyond the centrifuge, and there was never any risk to the
public.
According to the FDA, botulinum toxin can paralyze and kill if
consumed in food, but is also safely used, in a purified form, as a
medicine to control certain involuntary muscle contractions. It is
also commonly known for its cosmetic uses under the brand name Botox.
The school was using the botulinum toxin to study food-borne and
waterborne diseases under a contract with the NIH.
From the description, I would expect that in such an accident, the
toxin would tend to be aerosolized and the exposure would have
occurred via inhalation. The lack of any symptoms in this case is not
surprising based on some unpublished reports from studies performed
by the army in the 1940s. In those studies, they found that it was
very difficult to intoxicate test animals via the aerosol route, even
with relatively high doses of botulinum toxin. I don't know any more
than this about the studies, since I believe the details are still
classified, but I got this information from a scientist who
participated in the study.
