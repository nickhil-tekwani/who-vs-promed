A study in Italy has shown that one in 2 people who contracted COVID-19 and were hospitalized, even with mild or moderate cases, had cognitive problems or impairments after [having] recovered from illness. The research was published on Monday ([21 Jun 2021]) by the European Academy of Neurology (EAN). The study was led by the director of the neurology unit at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan and professor at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Massimo Filippi, and included the participation of 49 volunteers with a positive diagnosis for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.

"Our study confirmed significant cognitive and psychopathological issues associated with COVID-19 infection that persisted for several months after disease remission," Filippi said during the research presentation. Each volunteer underwent a thorough neuropsychological assessment and MRI 2 months after remission, that is, when the disease is under control and no longer shows symptoms.

Researchers showed that nearly one in 5 patients (18%) suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, 16% suffered from depressive disorders, 16% had problems with executive functions, such as problems with planning and speed. In developing information, 6% had long-term problems with memory, and 6% had problems of a visuospatial nature. Each person can have more than one symptom.

"An unexpected finding is that the changes in executive function that we analyzed, which can make it difficult to concentrate, plan, think, or remember, affect up to 3 out of 4 patients between the ages of 40 and 50. We are talking about hospitalized patients, but many with moderate cases," added the researcher and who participated in the study, Elisa Canu. However, researchers have not been able to determine whether the neuropsychological changes are directly related to the infection or are an indirect consequence of it, or whether the damage will be permanent.

[2] Delta plus variant
Date: Wed 23 Jun 2021

India on Wednesday [23 Jun 2021] said it has found about 40 cases of the delta coronavirus variant carrying a mutation that appears to make it more transmissible and advised states to increase testing. Here is what we know about the variant.

What is delta plus?
The variant, called delta plus in India, was first reported in a Public Health England bulletin on [11 Jun 2021]. It is a sublineage of the delta variant first detected in India and has acquired the spike protein mutation, called K417N, which is also found in the beta variant first identified in South Africa. Some scientists worry that the mutation, coupled with other existing features of the delta variant, could make it more transmissible. "The mutation K417N has been of interest as it is present in the beta variant (B.1.351 lineage), which was reported to have immune evasion property," India's health ministry said in a statement.

Shahid Jameel, a top Indian virologist, said the K417N was known to reduce the effectiveness of a cocktail of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies.

Where has it been found?
As of [16 Jun 2021], at least 197 cases have been found in 11 countries: Britain (36), Canada (1), India (8), Japan (15), Nepal (3), Poland (9), Portugal (22), Russia (1), Switzerland (18), Turkey (1), and the United States (83). India said on Wednesday [23 Jun 2021] about 40 cases of the variant have been observed in the states of Maharashtra, Kerala, and Madhya Pradesh, with "no significant increase in prevalence." The earliest case in India is from a sample taken on [5 Apr 2021]. Britain said its 1st 5 cases were sequenced on [26 Apr 2021], and they were contacts of individuals who had travelled from, or transited through, Nepal and Turkey. No deaths were reported among the United Kingdom and Indian cases.

What are the worries?
Studies are continuing in India and globally to test the effectiveness of vaccines against this mutation.

"WHO is tracking this variant as part of the delta variant, as we are doing for other Variants of Concern with additional mutations," the World Health Organization (WHO) said in a statement sent to Reuters news agency. "For the moment, this variant does not seem to be common, currently accounting for only a small fraction of the delta sequences ... Delta and other circulating Variants of Concern remain a higher public health risk as they have demonstrated increases in transmission," it said.

But India's health ministry warned that regions where it has been found "may need to enhance their public health response by focusing on surveillance, enhanced testing, quick contact-tracing, and priority vaccination." There are worries delta plus would inflict another wave of infections on India after it emerged from the world's worst surge in cases only recently. "The mutation itself may not lead to a 3rd wave in India -- that also depends on COVID-appropriate behaviour -- but it could be one of the reasons," said Tarun Bhatnagar, a scientist with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research.

[3] Immunity
Date: Tue 22 Jun 2021

How Immunity Generated from COVID-19 Vaccines Differs from an Infection
------------------------------------------
A key issue as we move closer to ending the pandemic is determining more precisely how long people exposed to SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19 virus, will make neutralizing antibodies against this dangerous coronavirus. Finding the answer is also potentially complicated with new SARS-CoV-2 "variants of concern" appearing around the world that could find ways to evade acquired immunity, increasing the chances of new outbreaks.

Now, a new NIH-supported study shows that the answer to this question will vary based on how an individual's antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were generated: over the course of a naturally acquired infection or from a COVID-19 vaccine. The new evidence shows that protective antibodies generated in response to an mRNA vaccine will target a broader range of SARS-CoV-2 variants carrying "single letter" changes in a key portion of their spike protein compared to antibodies acquired from an infection.

These results add to evidence that people with acquired immunity may have differing levels of protection to emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. More importantly, the data provide further documentation that those who've had and recovered from a COVID-19 infection still stand to benefit from getting vaccinated.

These latest findings come from Jesse Bloom, Allison Greaney, and their team at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle. In an earlier study, this same team focused on the receptor binding domain (RBD), a key region of the spike protein that studs SARS-CoV-2's outer surface. This RBD is especially important because the virus uses this part of its spike protein to anchor to another protein called ACE2 on human cells before infecting them. That makes RBD a prime target for both naturally acquired antibodies and those generated by vaccines. Using a method called deep mutational scanning, the Seattle group's previous study mapped out all possible mutations in the RBD that would change the ability of the virus to bind ACE2 and/or for RBD-directed antibodies to strike their targets.

In their new study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine, Bloom, Greaney, and colleagues looked again to the thousands of possible RBD variants to understand how antibodies might be expected to hit their targets there [1]. This time, they wanted to explore any differences between RBD-directed antibodies based on how they were acquired.

Again, they turned to deep mutational scanning. First, they created libraries of all 3800 possible RBD single amino acid mutants and exposed the libraries to samples taken from vaccinated individuals and unvaccinated individuals who'd been previously infected. All vaccinated individuals had received 2 doses of the Moderna mRNA vaccine. This vaccine works by prompting a person's cells to produce the spike protein, thereby launching an immune response and the production of antibodies.

By closely examining the results, the researchers uncovered important differences between acquired immunity in people who'd been vaccinated and unvaccinated people who'd been previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, antibodies elicited by the mRNA vaccine were more focused to the RBD compared to antibodies elicited by an infection, which more often targeted other portions of the spike protein. Importantly, the vaccine-elicited antibodies targeted a broader range of places on the RBD than those elicited by natural infection.

These findings suggest that natural immunity and vaccine-generated immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will differ in how they recognize new viral variants. What's more, antibodies acquired with the help of a vaccine may be more likely to target new SARS-CoV-2 variants potently, even when the variants carry new mutations in the RBD.

It's not entirely clear why these differences in vaccine- and infection-elicited antibody responses exist. In both cases, RBD-directed antibodies are acquired from the immune system's recognition and response to viral spike proteins. The Seattle team suggests these differences may arise because the vaccine presents the viral protein in slightly different conformations.

Also, it's possible that mRNA delivery may change the way antigens are presented to the immune system, leading to differences in the antibodies that get produced. A 3rd difference is that natural infection only exposes the body to the virus in the respiratory tract (unless the illness is very severe), while the vaccine is delivered to muscle, where the immune system may have an even better chance of seeing it and responding vigorously.

Whatever the underlying reasons turn out to be, it's important to consider that humans are routinely infected and re-infected with other common coronaviruses, which are responsible for the common cold. It's not at all unusual to catch a cold from seasonal coronaviruses year after year. That's at least in part because those viruses tend to evolve to escape acquired immunity, much as SARS-CoV-2 is now in the process of doing.

The good news so far is that, unlike the situation for the common cold, we have now developed multiple COVID-19 vaccines. The evidence continues to suggest that acquired immunity from vaccines still offers substantial protection against the new variants now circulating around the globe.

The hope is that acquired immunity from the vaccines will indeed produce long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2 and bring an end to the pandemic. These new findings point encouragingly in that direction. They also serve as an important reminder to roll up your sleeve for the vaccine if you haven't already done so, whether or not you've had COVID-19. Our best hope of winning this contest with the virus is to get as many people immunized now as possible. That will save lives and reduce the likelihood of even more variants appearing that might evade protection from the current vaccines.

[The finding that vaccine-elicited antibodies targeted a broader range of places on the RBD than those elicited by natural infection is important. As the authors state, it suggests "natural immunity and vaccine-generated immunity to SARS-CoV-2 will differ in how they recognize new viral variants. What's more, antibodies acquired with the help of a vaccine may be more likely to target new SARS-CoV-2 variants potently, even when the variants carry new mutations in the RBD." Thus, even those who have recovered from infection should be immunized. - Mod.LK]
