A recently emerged strain of avian influenza virus in poultry in Southeast Asia known as A(H5N6) represents a new threat to animal health and livelihoods and must be closely monitored, FAO has said.

Chinese authorities 1st reported the influenza A(H5N6) virus in poultry in April 2014. Since then, the Lao People's Democratic Republic and Viet Nam have also detected the H5N6 virus in poultry.

"Influenza viruses are constantly mixing and recombining to form new threats," said FAO's Chief Veterinary Officer, Juan Lubroth. "However, H5N6 is particularly worrisome, since it has been detected in several places so far from one another, and because it is so highly pathogenic, meaning infected poultry quickly become sick and, within 72 hours, death rates are very high."

The fact that the virus is highly virulent in chickens and geese and potentially could spread across a large part of Southeast Asia translates into a real threat to poultry-related livelihoods. Poultry contributes to the incomes of hundreds of millions of people throughout the subregion.

The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), which works together with FAO and the World Health Organization(WHO) to support countries' responses to animal and human disease threats, is also monitoring the situation closely.

"An effective surveillance and an early detection of animal disease at source are 2 main keys to reduce the risk of dissemination and to ensure safe trade. The OIE calls on its 180 member countries to respect their commitment and to immediately notify on WAHIS any outbreak detected on their territory," said OIE Director-General Bernard Vallat.

Only one case of H5N6 has been reported in humans after contact with exposure to poultry shortly after its detection in China. The person later died. There have been no other human cases. Though the scientific community is still in the process of understanding the dynamics of this new strain, it is unlikely that H5N6 represents an immediate and significant threat to human health.

"Current evidence suggests H5N6 poses a limited threat to human health at this stage," said WHO epidemiologist Elizabeth Mumford. "It's been detected in multiple places in poultry, yet we only have one human infection reported. This suggests that the virus does not easily jump from animals to humans. Of course, we still need to remain vigilant, because prevalence in poultry and, therefore, human exposure could increase during the winter."

Even if the public health risks posed by H5N6 currently appear to be low, other pathogens, including other subtypes of influenza viruses such as H5N1 and H7N9, still can present cause for concern. FAO and WHO recommend consumers follow appropriate hygiene, food preparation and food safety guidelines.

[The 1st human infection with (A)H5N6 avian influenza virus was reported from central China (Sichuan province) on 4 May 2014; the patient died. Local media had reported his sickness already on 23 Apr 2014. The regional Ministry of Agriculture published on 4 May 2014 a report indicating that the poultry holding of the patient had been under investigation of the Sechuan veterinary department since 23 Apr 2014 and that on 3 May 2014, the reference laboratory isolated avian influenza virus subtype H5N6 from the samples. This information was officially notified to the OIE on 5 May 2014, designating the causative agent as low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N6 of low pathogenicity for poultry; this complied also with the recorded clinical picture (apparent morbidity rate 0.07 percent). However, following further investigations by the OIE reference laboratory for avian influenza in in Harbin, the strain was confirmed as highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N6. The previous immediate notification to the OIE was, therefore, accordingly amended.

On 7 May 2014, the veterinary services of Laos notified the OIE about an outbreak of HPAI H5N6 which had taken place almost 2 months earlier, starting on 13 Mar 2014. No data on the clinical observations were provided, but the notification included the following epidemiological information:
"1. Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: introduction of new live animals
2. Epidemiological comments: samples from this outbreak have now been tested at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory. Sequencing analysis of original samples (post-mortem tissues) from both chickens and ducks shows that these are H5N6 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, with the highly pathogenic HA cleavage site sequence motif, PLRERRRKR*GLF. Phylogenetic analysis of the HA gene sequence indicates that the HA is derived from the Asian H5N1 clade 2.3.4 HA lineage; however, they clustered with 'variant' (reassortant) clade 2.3.4 H5 HPAI viruses from China of various NA subtypes. Follow-up sequencing of virus isolates from these samples confirms these findings. Full genome sequencing has been completed."

In July 2014, Viet Nam reported to the OIE that avian influenza isolates from 2 earlier outbreaks, in April and June 2014, had caused an apparent morbidity rate of 50 percent. The notification included the following epidemiological comments: "This is a new strain detected from outbreak surveillance activities. The initial result was positive for H5 but negative for N1. Therefore, further testing was needed, and the final result was only available in July 2014 (N6 positive). All poultry in affected flocks were destroyed immediately when poultry showing clinical signs of HPAI were detected. Samples were taken from surrounding poultry flocks. All were negative for avian influenza."

The described events in the 3 counties underline the great importance of early submission of samples from suspected AI cases to local and reference laboratories.

It remains to be established how a new AI strain has been found to be circulating in the 3 neighbouring countries almost simultaneously. Most likely, the virus spread (wherefrom?) by live poultry along the intensive trade routes known to prevail in the region. However, other potential routes, such as wild birds, deserve to be attended to as well by the investigators. - Mod.AS
