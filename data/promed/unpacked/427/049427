The plum pox virus, which decreases fruit production but doesn't harm
people, has been detected for the 1st time in New York at a Niagara County
orchard, agriculture officials have announced. The virus was found on plum
tree leaf samples collected by the state Department of Agriculture and
Markets as part of a 7-year survey for the virus.
The plum pox virus was detected in neighboring Pennsylvania in 1999 and
Canada, within 5 miles of the Niagara County location, in 2000. The strain
found in all 3 locations, the D strain, is less virulent and easier to
contain than other strains, authorities said.
Plum pox is a viral disease of stone fruits, including peaches, nectarines,
plums, and apricots. The virus is spread by insects, in whose mouthparts
the virus can stay viable for about an hour.
The virus severely decreases a tree's fruit production. Infected fruit may
appear deformed or blemished and could drop prematurely from trees.
However, there is no danger to animals or people who eat it, experts said.
The United States Department of Agriculture, which confirmed the presence
of the virus in New York, will work with state officials on an eradication
program. Specialists are currently surveying a 5 mile radius around the 108
tree orchard where the virus was found to determine the extent of
infestation and establish a quarantine area.
The discovery is not expected to hinder production or the harvest of stone
fruit in Niagara County this year, state agriculture officials said.

[The fruit crop plant plum, _Prunus domestica_, develops virus symptoms in
the fruit when infected by the plum pox virus (PPV, family: _Potyviridae_,
genus: _Potyvirus_).
PPV, also known as Sharka, has been devastating stone fruit crops in Europe
since the early 1900s. It was found in Chile in 1992. The disease is spread
by aphids, which can generally transmit infection several hundred metres
from the initial source plant. PPV affects cultivated peach, nectarine,
apricot, almond, and cherry, as well as plum. It also can infect wild
Prunus (stone fruit) species and a large number of wild and introduced
weeds. PPV often causes markings on stone fruits, which make the fruit
unmarketable.
PPV was first detected in the USA in 1998, and since that time an effort at
detection and eradication has managed to suppress the virus well. This
effort has been greatest in Pennsylvania, where the previous detections
were found including a positive find in peach on 4 Jul 2006
(20060705.1843). Despite the overall success at suppression, this 1st
report of PPV in New York State is a reminder that eradication in the USA
remains elusive. This is the 1st time the disease has been found at any
location in the USA outside of Pennsylvania. The strain of virus that has
been found in Pennsylvania and now New York is the "D" strain, which is
thought not to infect cherries.
The USA federal government has releases USD 2.1 million in funds for
Pennsylvania farmers whose crops have been damaged by PPV. The money will
be used to reimburse farmers whose fruit trees were destroyed because of
the virus. When a virus-infected tree is found, the US Department of
Agriculture establishes a 500 metre buffer zone around the infected tree
and orders removal and destruction of all stone fruit trees within that
zone. Presumably similar compensation will eventually be made available to
any New York growers who experience eradication.
A genetically modified (GM) plum that is resistant to PPV has been
developed by USDA plant breeder Dr Ralph Scorza and is being considered for
regulatory approval. It could potentially be used as germplasm to breed new
stone fruit varieties that are resistant to the virus.
