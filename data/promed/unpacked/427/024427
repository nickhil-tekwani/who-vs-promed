Child hospitalised in measles outbreak
--------------------------------------
A child was tonight [24 Nov 2009] fighting for its life after
contracting pneumonia from an outbreak of measles, health chiefs
confirmed. The Health Service Executive (HSE) urged parents
nationwide to make sure their children are vaccinated against the
disease after a surge in cases. Medics raised concerns that the
outbreak, which started in August [2009], could spread among
youngsters who have not being protected.

Dr Suzanne Cotter, a specialist in public health medicine, said 11
cases have been reported to date in this month, bringing the total to
75 so far this year. "This compares to 50 for the same period in
2008," said Dr Cotter. "18 people have been hospitalised with measles
this year but no deaths have been reported."

The HSE's Health Protection Surveillance Centre revealed one
youngster has been left battling pneumonia as a result of the measles
infection and is in intensive care and on ventilation. Dr Cotter said
in 80 percent of cases the children were aged under 10 years, with 30
percent of those aged between one and 2 years. The majority of cases
have occurred among children from the Traveller community.

"Measles is highly infectious and can cause severe illness and
occasionally cause death," continued Dr Cotter. "An outbreak in 2000
resulted in more than 1600 cases and 3 deaths. "As vaccination with
the MMR [measles, mumps and rubella triple vaccine] is the only way
to prevent measles infection, all parents must make sure their
children have received the recommended 2 doses of the vaccine. "While
the 1st dose is usually given at 12 months of age by GPs and the 2nd
in school at 4-5 years of age, the vaccine can be received at any
time."

[Traveling communities in Ireland and elsewhere are always at risk of
childhood diseases because their itinerant way of life often excludes
them from the normal pattern of routine immunisations. The
persistence of measles virus in these communities can reveal
inadequacies in vaccine coverage in the general population and
emphasises the need for continued vigilance. Parents should be made
aware that as in the present report measles virus infection can be a
life-threatening illness in a young child if unvaccinated.
