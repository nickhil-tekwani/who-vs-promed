The island of Reunion (population 750 000) in the Indian Ocean is
experiencing an extensive outbreak of Chikungunya fever, an arboviral
disease thought by the outbreak investigators to be transmitted by _Aedes
albopictus_ mosquitoes. Between 28 Mar 2005 and 15 Jan 2006, there have
been an estimated 10 750 suspected cases of Chikungunya fever in Reunion in
patients who consulted a general practitioner. Of the suspected cases, 2424
have been laboratory-confirmed. According to a mathematical model based on
historical series, the estimated cumulative number of cases with clinical
signs compatible with acute Chikungunya fever since the beginning of this
outbreak (whether or not patients sought medical consultation) could be
around 30 000 (upper limit 41 541, 95 percent CI)
The outbreak of Chikungunya fever in La Reunion first presented a limited
peak from 9-15 May 2005, before the number of cases decreased with the
onset of the southern hemisphere winter. From mid-July, the incidence
remained stable for a period of over three months, with an estimated 50 to
100 new suspect cases per week. The incidence then rose again, at first
moderately, at the beginning of October. In mid-December, the epidemic
pattern changed suddenly, as the southern hemisphere summer's
meteorological conditions are favourable for the multiplication of the vector.
Chikungunya virus was circulating in the Comoros archipelago and in
Mauritius at the beginning of 2005. The first cases identified on Reunion
were imported from the Comoros.
Transmission is now occurring very rapidly on the island. The weekly
estimated number of cases has been increasing exponentially since the end
of December 2005, and has not yet peaked. The number of cases is estimated
to have reached around 5000 for the 2nd week of January 2006. Transmission
is occurring in every district of the island, but is particularly active in
the district of Saint-Pierre in the south of the island, especially in the
city of Saint-Louis.
To date, 15 cases of meningoencephalitis have been notified, of which 12
have been microbiologically confirmed by the French national reference
centre for arboviral diseases in Lyon. The other cases are still under
investigation. 6 cases occurred in newborns, and mother-to-child
transmission is strongly suspected in these cases. The other 9 identified
cases occurred in adults with pre-existing medical conditions. All cases
have since progressed favourably. This is the first time that
meningoencephalitis forms of Chikungunya, and mother-to-child transmission
of the Chikungunya virus, have been reported in Chikungunya outbreaks.
To date, no death has been directly attributed to acute Chikungunya
infection. Patients with underlying medical conditions, however, are
vulnerable and prone to developing complications and organ failure.
Surveillance and control:
The _Aedes albopictus_ mosquito lays its eggs in any water-containing
receptacle, in both urban and non-urban areas. Pots, tyres and tin cans are
favoured habitats. In spite of the intensification of vector control
efforts in communities these past few months, the number of transmission
sources has spread across the island. Individual prevention messages have
targeted those most at risk and are being reinforced.
The surveillance system implemented to date was based on the investigations
of the vector control teams, and case finding at the local level. As the
number of cases has greatly increased, surveillance has been switched to a
sentinel system of general practitioners since the last week of 2005. This
system, however, will allow the monitoring of trends of this outbreak. The
surveillance of severe cases has been intensified.
Teams from the Institut de Veille Sanitaire in France have been
collaborating closely with local authorities and medical practitioners to
help monitor and control this outbreak and this collaboration will continue
while the outbreak is ongoing.
Special advice is being given for pregnant women, vulnerable people, and
newborns to avoid mosquito bites, particularly by using mosquito nets. A
list of mosquito repellants that are not contra-indicated for pregnant
women and children has been made available.

An epidemic of a crippling and incurable [see comment below]
mosquito-borne disease has continued to spread throughout the Indian Ocean
island of Reunion, with thousands of new cases reported.
Only in the last week more than 5600 new cases were reported, taking the
total number of people infected by chikungunya to 22 167 on the
French-ruled island since the beginning of the epidemic in March 2005, said
Gilles Brucker, director of a government health monitoring institute on
Thursday.
"We should expect that the number of cases will pass 30 000," Brucker said.
Chikungunya is Swahili for "that which bends up" and refers to the stooped
posture of those afflicted by the non-fatal disease for which there is no
known vaccine or cure.
The disease is "very painful, very crippling for certain persons" and could
be "potentially serious for weak and vulnerable patients," Brucker said.
In several death certificates issued since the beginning of the month, the
disease was "mentioned as a possible cause of death," he added.
Local authorities have decided to postpone for one week students' return to
high schools and colleges, initially planned for next Monday [30 Jan] after
the main summer holiday, in order to decontaminate schools.
Mayors throughout the island should decide later on Thursday if the return
of primary school students should also be adjourned.
Authorities on the volcanic island east of Madagascar, a French overseas
department with a population of 760 000 and a popular holiday destination,
have earmarked 600 000 Euros (USD 720 000) to fight the outbreak, including
special mosquito-eradication brigades.
Top health ministry official Didier Houssain, accompanying Brucker, called
for measures to be stepped up against mosquitoes, particularly by
eliminating some 250 unauthorized garbage dumps on the island and
installing modern incinerators.
The number of "commandos" tasked to intervene in the field will be
increased from 11 to 20, and a special free telephone number for tourists
will be introduced.

[The current chikungunya outbreak on Reunion Island is obviously serious
and widespread, in that students are ordered to postpone their returning
date after the summer holidays so to allow mosquito control measures.
Although chikungunya is normally non-fatal, immune-compromised and weak
individuals may be vulnerable in the current situation. - Mod.RY]
