Wild poliovirus type 2 reference strains isolated in India
----------------------------------------------------------
Wild poliovirus type 2 (wP2) circulation has not been detected globally
since October 1999. In mid-December 2002, wP2 isolation was reported from a
stool specimen collected on 24 Nov 2002 from a case of acute flaccid
paralysis (AFP) in Western Uttar Pradesh (WUP), India. Since then, an
additional 4 wP2 were reported from AFP cases in WUP and one from Gujarat.
Laboratory tests determined that all viruses reported are closely related
to widely-available reference strains of wP2 (MEF-1)(1), and unrelated to
wP2 found in any part of the world over the past 2 decades. A joint
Government of India and World Health Organization investigation has been
initiated to determine the source of the MEF-1-related viruses in the
specimens. Concurrent with this investigation, plans will be developed to
assess and strengthen laboratory containment procedures in India. Already
planned large-scale immunization rounds in northern India will be carried
out in April and June, following the national immunization rounds in
January and February, as part of polio eradication activities in India.
(1) MEF-1 (wild poliovirus type 2) reference strain is used widely in
laboratories and in inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) manufacturing sites.

[An excellent map on the identification of wild poliovirus in India in 2002
and 2003 is available at: <http://www.rotarypolioplusindia.org/map1.htm>. A
table gives the number of isolates by virus type by year; the website says
the data are as of 6 Mar 2003:
Virus type isolated / 2002 / 2003
Total P1 wild cases / 1483 / 37
Total P3 wild cases / 113 / 3
Total P1+P3 wild cases / 3 / - (both viruses isolated from same patient)
Total isolates / 1599 / 40
We have been unable to verify the information in the above email so we are
posting this cautiously as a request for information. In the most recent
polio laboratory bulletin available online of Dec 2002
<http://www.who.int/vaccines/en/poliolab/2002/VolVIIIIssue4Dec2002.pdf>
during the period Jan to Sep 2002, 1017 polioviruses were isolated in the
South East Asian Region to which India belongs, 801 of which were
poliovirus type 1, 57 were poliovirus type 2, and 159 were poliovirus type
3. Among viral isolates that were further identified by intratypic
differentiation (wild virus vs. vaccine virus), 825 of the poliovirus type
1 were wild virus and 115 vaccine virus; none of the poliovirus type 2 were
wild virus and 66 were vaccine virus; and 66 of the poliovirus type 3 were
wild virus and 113 vaccine virus types.
In the 30 Mar 2001 Weekly Epidemiological Record
<http://www.who.int/wer/pdf/2001/wer7613.pdf> there was discussion on the
apparent interruption of transmission of wild poliovirus type 2. "The last
countries to report wild poliovirus type 2 isolates were Egypt in 1990,
Afghanistan and Pakistan in 1997, Nigeria in 1998, and India in 1999. It
appears that the last remaining reservoir of wild poliovirus type 2
transmission globally was located in the northern Indian states of Bihar,
Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. Several type 2 isolates were obtained from
this region during 1998-1999. The genetic relatedness of these type 2
isolates was consistent with few sustaining chains of virus transmission.
The last wild poliovirus type 2 isolated was from an AFP case in West Bihar
with paralysis onset in October 1999.
ProMED-mail would appreciate more information on the above report, and if
there are results of the mentioned investigation as to the origins of the
virus isolates. - Mod.MPP]
