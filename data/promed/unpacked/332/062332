Over 20 000 ha [49 421 acres] cropped area have been affected by hailstorms and yellow rust in Jammu region. Farmers from plain areas have suffered huge losses.

[In some areas] yellow rust has caused damage to wheat crops [with] nearly 25 per cent [of the] crop affected in the last 3 weeks. Farmers are now facing the problem [that] yellow rust may further aggravate and would spread with improvement in weather.

[The Department of] Agriculture, Jammu, said that over 1200 ha [about 2965 acres] have been affected by yellow rust. They are providing guidelines to farmers and treatment of affected crops.

[Stripe rust (also called yellow rust) of cereals is caused by the fungus _Puccinia striiformis_ (previously var. _striiformis_ or _tritici_). The disease affects wheat, some barley varieties, triticale, and a number of wild grasses. It causes yellow leaf stripes, loss of plant vigour, and stunting of plants with yield losses of 40 to 100 per cent in wheat.

Spores are wind dispersed in several cycles during the cropping season. Grasses and volunteer crop plants may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next crop cycle. Disease monitoring is important so timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include the use of resistant varieties, fungicide applications and control of pathogen reservoirs.

New pathogen strains with increased virulence and additional fungicide resistances have been reported in recent years from wheat growing areas worldwide, including from India (ProMED-mail post 20090329.1216). However, no information is given above to suggest a new strain. Monitoring and resistance breeding programmes have been established in different regions for early detection of new rust strains and to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.
