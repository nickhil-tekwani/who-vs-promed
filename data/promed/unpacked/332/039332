**** Total number of human cases of WNV illness reported to ArboNET by
state and local health departments.
Blood donors
------------
A total of 143 presumptive West Nile viremic blood donors (PVDs) have been

PVDs, 3 people aged 35, 69, and 77 years subsequently had neuroinvasive
illness, and 32 people (median age: 55 years; range: 17 to 73 years)
subsequently had West Nile fever.
Dead birds
----------
In addition, during 2004, a total of 4188 dead corvids and 987 other dead
birds with WNV infection have been reported from 44 states and New York City.
Equines

[Details of the numbers and distribution of equine cases can be obtained by
accessing the APHIS-USDA map
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahps/equine/wnv/map2004.html>. As of Thu 16
Sep 2004 (the last date of update), the total number of equine cases in the
USA in 2004 now stands at 657, an increase of 246 cases since 3 Sep 2004.
California heads the list with 253 cases (39 per cent of the total),
followed by Nevada with 70 cases, Arizona with 81 cases, Nevada with 38,
Texas with 36 cases, Wyoming with 30 cases, Colorado with 25 cases, and
another 28 states with smaller numbers. - Mod.CP]
Other mammals
-------------

squirrels with WNV infection were reported from Arizona. 6 unidentified
animal species with WNV infection were reported from Arizona, Idaho,
Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, and Nevada.
Sentinel chickens and others
----------------------------
WNV seroconversions have been reported in 799 sentinel chicken flocks from
13 states (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Delaware, Florida, Iowa,
Louisiana, Nebraska, Nevada, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Utah) and in 7
wild hatchling birds from Missouri and Ohio. 3 seropositive sentinel horses
were reported from Puerto Rico.
Mosquito pools
--------------
A total of 5707 WNV positive mosquito pools have been reported from 34
states and New York City.
Additional information about national WNV activity is available from CDC at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/index.htm> and at
<http://westnilemaps.usgs.gov>.
[The above report is supplemented by a figure showing the location of the
39 states reporting cases of human WNV infection in relation to the states
reporting non-human cases of WNV infection only, and the few remaining
states still to report cases of WNV this year.
In the past 7 days, the number of human cases has increased by 218 from
1386 to 1604, and the total number of WNV related deaths has risen by 13
from 35 to 48. No new states were added to the list of states reporting
human cases of WNV infection. - Mod.CP]

Louisiana: 15 new cases in past week
------------------------------------
15 new West Nile cases brought the total so far this year to 55; 4 of them
without any symptoms. The total is almost as high as the 59 cases reported
by 23 Sep last year [2003].
WNV activity appears to be slowing down in Louisiana, however, and no new
cases of La Crosse or St Louis encephalitis virus infection have been
reported, said Dr Raoult Ratard, the state epidemiologist. There have been
no new deaths, leaving the total at 3.
Most of the new cases were in north west Louisiana -- 3 in Bossier Parish
and 6 in Caddo Parish, where 3 of the asymptomatic cases were reported.
There were also 2 each in Livingston and East Baton Rouge parishes, and one
each in Morehouse and Red River parishes.
At this time in 2003, Louisiana also had 5 cases of St Louis encephalitis
and one of eastern equine encephalitis. So far in 2004, the state has had 2
cases of St Louis encephalitis virus infection and 3 of La Crosse. There
were no new cases of either virus this week, Ratard said.
The state ended 2003 with 121 West Nile cases and 7 deaths. There were 330
cases and 25 deaths in 2002.

Mexico: West Nile virus infection surveillance data as of Tue 21 Sep 2004
---------------------------------------------------
[The following figures have been extracted from the Resumen Epidemiologico
file <http://www.cenave.gob.mx/von/archivos/ResumenCASOSVON.xls>
accompanying the pictorial maps of WNV activity in Mexico. - Mod.CP]
Cumulative totals - humans
--------------------------
As of Tue 21 Sep 2004, the figures remain unchanged from those reported on
Tue 9 Sep 2004 - that is, a total of 210 individuals resident in 25 of the
32 states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection: 209
were seronegative and asymptomatic, and one individual in the state of
Sonora exhibited signs of disease. [see: West Nile virus - Mexico (Sonora)
20040905.2486]
Cumulative totals - equines
---------------------------
As of Tue 21 Sep 2004, a total of 2399 (an increase of 115) horses from 29
of the 32 states have been tested for evidence of West Nile virus
infection. Of these animals 1763 (an increase of 2) were seronegative and
636 (an increase of 113) were seropositive. All these animals were
asymptomatic.
Cumulative totals - birds
-------------------------
As of Tue 21 Sep 2004, a total of 738 birds from 7 of the 32 states have
been tested for evidence of West Nile virus infection. Of these birds 685
were seronegative and 51 were seropositive (and considered to be
asymptomatic), and one case in the state of Sonora and one case in the
state of Baja California exhibited signs of disease. (Previously both birds
appear to have been assigned to the state of Sonora).
[Sonora state, where the single human case and one of the 2 avian cases
were confirmed, shares its northern border with the state of Arizona in the
USA. The majority (35 percent) of the seropositive equines were reported
from Sonora state. - Mod.CP]
