UK: withdrawal of license may not affect UK vaccination campaign
----------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization yesterday [Tue 5 Oct 2004] suggested there
may be an international shortage of influenza vaccines this winter, as
medicines watchdogs suspended the British manufacturing license of the
world's 2nd largest supplier. The 3 month ban on Chiron Vaccines' plant in
Speke, Liverpool, means that the company will not supply any of its
Fluvirin product during the northern hemisphere's flu season. UK health
authorities say they have made alternative arrangements to make up for the
loss of Chiron's near 20 per cent share of the National Health Service's
(NHS) supplies, although general practitioners have complained that they
have had to reschedule clinics because of late notice of the problems and
interrupted delivery. The NHS flu vaccination campaign in Britain, which
uses 5 other suppliers, was only launched on Mon 4 Oct 2004. It aims to
give 14 million doses mostly to people 65 and over, and to those with
chronic illness, and it was not clear last night whether vaccinations
delivered privately might be hit. The manufacturing process for flu
vaccines takes months.
In the US, the company had expected to supply nearly half the 100 million
doses of vaccine this year [2004], and Klaus Stohr, WHO's head of influenza
control, said there could be "significant implications" for supplies
elsewhere. "It may be resolvable, but that would require a lot of
adjustment on the part of other companies," he told Associated Press.
The Chiron Corporation, parent of the vaccine company, which is the 2nd
largest supplier of influenza vaccine in the world, said the decision by
the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) would
mean it would not supply any vaccine this flu season. In August 2004,
Chiron had admitted "a small number of lots" tested for the US market had
not met product sterility specifications but said internal investigations
indicated "no widespread issues with the manufacturing process." Chiron's
president and chief executive officer, Howard Pien, said the company
"deeply regrets that we will be unable to meet public health needs this
season." In a statement, the company added that it had hoped the MHRA, the
Liverpool plant's regulator, would have completed the review process in
time to allow release of the vaccine early this month [Oct 2004]. "However,
the MHRA has asserted that Chiron's manufacturing process does not comply
with UK good manufacturing process regulations, and, has suspended the
company's Liverpool facility license to manufacture influenza vaccine for 6
months. Chiron has initiated discussions with the MHRA to determine
appropriate corrective actions." The plant concerned was formerly owned by
Powderject, run by the Labour party donor Paul Drayson, once at the heart
of a dispute over a contract for smallpox vaccines, but that company was
bought by Chiron last year [2003].
The MHRA last night [Tue 5 Oct] declined to say why it had suspended the
Liverpool plant's license beyond citing "a problem with the manufacturing
process." Other information was commercially confidential. The Royal
College of General Practitioners said it was confident there would be
enough vaccine for the winter but advised health care professionals to
concentrate on the most at-risk patients if there were delays.

UK government suspends influenza vaccine license
------------------------------------------------
The UK government has suspended the manufacturing license of major
influenza vaccine maker Chiron. The Medicines and Healthcare products
Regulatory Agency (MHRSA) said the 3 month suspension would take place with
immediate effect. The suspension means the Oxford-based company, which
makes Fluvirin, will not be able to supply influenza vaccines to anyone,
including the major US market. There are concerns about the way the vaccine
is manufactured.
The MHRA decision could have a particularly severe impact in the US, as
Chiron is responsible for half of the flu vaccines distributed in the
country. In the UK, doctors have been advised to prioritize the most
vulnerable patients until supplies return to normal. Despite government
assurances that the suspension will have a minimal impact in the UK, the
British Medical Association (BMA) insists it could cause serious problems.
Dr Hamish Meldrum, chairman of the BMA's General Practitioners' Committee,
said: "This will have a significant impact on the influenza immunization
program in this country, and the impact will be patchy. This is because
practices tend to get their whole flu vaccine supply from one supplier.
Those practices affected by the shortage will have to cancel influenza
immunization clinics until doses come through."
In August 2004, Chiron announced that millions of doses of influenza
vaccine made in Liverpool were contaminated, and, delayed shipment to the
US until October 2004. A company spokesman said extensive tests and safety
checks had subsequently been carried out, and the company was confident
that its products now met the highest standards. He said the MHRA decision
was unexpected, but he also said Chiron would immediately begin discussions
to determine what further action was required to meet UK safety standards.
In a statement, the company said the MHRA suspension would mean that it
would be unable to release any of its products during the 2004-05 flu season.
Chiron is one of 6 suppliers of the influenza vaccine in the UK. The
Department of Health said that of the 14 million doses of influenza vaccine
they had ordered, Chiron had only been due to supply 2.4 million.
Contingency plans had been made to ensure adequate stocks would be
available to meet any potential shortfall.
"I am confident that we will have enough vaccine for the winter," Dr
Douglas Fleming stated. However, [he] admitted some people might experience
a delay in getting their regular inoculation. It is recommended that
influenza vaccines should be administered in the UK by early November,
before cases start to mount. A spokesperson said: "We are confident that we
have sufficient vaccines for this winter's campaign, and contingency
supplies will be available as soon as possible. "We have arranged for an
extra 1.2 million doses to be available to doctors' surgeries by the end of
October [2004] and a further one million by mid-November."
The World Health Organization said the suspension could have a major impact
elsewhere, particularly as the flu season is just beginning in the northern
hemisphere. Dr Klaus Stohr, WHO's influenza chief, said: "The implications
may be significant. There could be a shortage. It may be resolvable, but
that would require a lot of adjustment on the part of the other companies."
Chiron makes a total of 4 influenza vaccines: Agrippal, Begrivac, Fluad,
and Fluvirin. The last of these is the number 2 flu vaccine in the US,
which accounts for the majority of supplies, although 20 per cent go to the
UK and Europe. Geoffrey Porges, a market analyst with US firm Bernstein &
Co said: "The fact that the US will potentially only have 50 million doses
is a public health nightmare." Vaccine makers do not have a lot of spare
stock because they produce on demand.

Fluvirin influenza vaccine manufacturer's license suspended
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) suspended
Chiron Vaccines manufacturer's license for influenza vaccine on Tue 5 Oct
2004 for a period of 3 months, with immediate effect. A result of this
action is that the company will not be able to release any batches of their
influenza vaccine (Fluvirin) manufactured at their Speke [Liverpool] site
to any market. The suspension was imposed as a result of Chiron's failure
to comply with the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practice, leading to
concerns of possible microbial contamination of product.
The suspension does not affect any other product manufactured at Speke
(including yellow fever vaccine). Influenza vaccines manufactured at
Chiron's sites in Italy and Germany (Agippal and Begrivac) are also not
affected by this suspension. No vaccine manufactured at Chiron's site in
Speke for the present campaign has been released.
