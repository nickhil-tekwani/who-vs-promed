Bird Flu Spreads to Most Bali Districts; Lombok on Edge Over Poultry
Deaths
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Health authorities in Bali said on Friday [14 Oct 2011] that the bird
flu virus that killed 2 children there last week had spread to 8 of 9
districts on the island, while residents in neighboring Lombok are
reporting similar chicken deaths.

Putu Sumantra, head of the Bali Livestock Agency, said that only
Gianyar district had not reported cases of poultry dying from the
disease. "This is quite surprising, especially given how quickly the
disease is spreading," he said.

He added that the pattern of the spread of the disease was similar,
although smaller in scale, to 2007, when a bird flu pandemic swept the
island. "Back then, around 4000 birds died, but this time the figure
is much smaller," Sumantra said. "Nevertheless, the deaths of the 2
children is a very shocking thing to come to terms with."

Almost 2800 birds are confirmed to have contracted avian influenza.
More than 1300 died from the disease and a further 1200 were culled.

"Most of the cases occurred in poultry raised on small farms,"
Sumantra said. "Those on larger commercial farms tend to be vaccinated
on a regular basis so aren't as vulnerable."

Ketut Kariyasa Adnyana, a member of the provincial legislature,
expressed concern that the spread of the disease would hurt the
island's all-important tourism industry. He also said it came at a
particularly critical time, with US President Barack Obama among the
clutch of world leaders scheduled to arrive in Bali for the East Asia
Summit. "The provincial and district authorities should take immediate
steps to address this problem. We can't afford to let it get out of
hand," he said.

On the neighboring tourist island of Lombok, sudden poultry deaths
attributed to bird flu are also mounting.

Hundreds of chickens died on Friday at an Army dormitory in Mataram,
the provincial capital, residents reported. A veterinary team from
Bali has been to the site to take back tissue samples to test for
avian influenza.

A resident said he and his neighbors had immediately buried the dead
birds for fear that they had died from bird flu and that the virus
could spread.

However, Retno Prayudo Yanti, head of the municipal animal hospital,
said initial tests showed the chickens had probably died from
Newcastle disease. The virus that causes Newcastle disease in birds
poses no serious health threat to humans, although exposure to
infected poultry can lead to mild flu-like symptoms. "But even though
the initial results suggest Newcastle disease, we still need further
tests before we can rule out bird flu," Retno said.

The provincial health office also said it was not taking any chances
and was urging all residents with flu-like symptoms to see a doctor
immediately. "There haven't been any confirmed cases of bird flu among
humans here recently, but this area is endemic for the disease so we
have to be careful," a spokesman for the office said.

A thousand of backyard chickens die of bird flu
-----------------------------------------------
About 1000 backyard chickens in 3 locations in Central Lombok suddenly
died. A village was isolated following to the event.

Examination by Livestock and Animal Health Service of Nusa Tenggara
Barat province in Mataram, confirmed bird flu H5N1 infection. Samples
were examined in laboratories in Mataram and Bali.

H5N1 infection was found in 3 villages, Semayan (Praya Sub-district),
Peringgarata (Peringgarata Sub-district) and Penujak (Praya Barat Daya
Sub-district). About 400 dead chickens reported from Semayam, 500 from
Peringgarata and 1000 from Penujak.

It is unclear whether the virus is spreading within those areas or
transmitted from other location.

The last bird flu outbreak in these areas was in 2008, and was
controlled well.

Livestock Service concerned several points in Lombok which used as
un-official ports for bringing in animals without quarantine
inspection.

[Indonesia is one of the 6 countries where HPAI H5N1 is known to have
become endemic. For the location of Bali see map at
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:IndonesiaBali.png; Lombok is the
island eastern to Bali.

Indonesia includes vaccination as one of its main control measures
addressing HPAI H5N1; no vaccination statistics are available in the
annual OIE reports. When properly planned and adopted, vaccination is
regarded a powerful tool for the control and eradication of avian
influenza in poultry. As indicated in the above media reports,
backyard poultry in the above affected territories have probably not
been vaccinated.

Indonesia has been applying, since several years, a Participatory
Disease Surveillance and Response (PDSR) programme, which includes
periodic visits to villages. Recent observations, obtained by the
programme, have been included in FAO-AIDE News 81 of 13 Oct 2011 (see
archived 20111014.3079). According to the said report, no village
visits were undertaken during July and/or August 2011 in several named
provinces, including West Nusa Tenggara (Nusa Tenggara Barat).

The issue of vaccination impact upon the evolution of A/H5N1 viruses
in several countries, including Indonesia, has been recently subject
to analysis and discussion in a scientific paper (Ref 1). One of the
main conclusions of the authors was that if vaccination was not
properly applied (which includes leaving proportions of the
susceptible avian population unvaccinated), and not coupled with
careful surveillance, robust vaccine strategies and strict
bio-security precautions, vaccination may contribute to the rapid
evolution and antigenic change of H5N1 viruses, creating opportunities
for the viruses to escape from vaccine protection.

[Nusa Tenggara Barat (also known as West Nusa Tenggara) is a province
in south-central Indonesia. The province encompasses the western
portion of the Lesser Sunda Islands except for Bali as the Wallace
line running the length of the Lombok Strait forms the western
boundary of the province. The two largest islands in the province are
Lombok in the west and the larger Sumbawa island in the east. Mataram,
on Lombok, is the capital and largest city of the province.
