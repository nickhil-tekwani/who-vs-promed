A rare bacterial infection usually found in rabbits and rodents [as well as
over 100 other mammalian species and numerous arthropods -DS has been
blamed for the death of one person and the infection of at least 9 others
on Martha's Vineyard since Jun 2000, according to health officials. A 43
year old male from Chilmark, died Saturday [26 Aug 2000 after he was
stricken with tularemia, according to Maia Gaillard, a Martha's Vineyard
Hospital spokeswoman. She said he was severely ill when he came to the
hospital, and later was transferred to Boston Medical Center, where he died.
All 9 of the other people known to have tularemia were successfully treated
with antibiotics and recovered, Roseanne Pawelec, spokeswoman for the state
Department of Public Health, told the Cape Cod Times. The disease is passed
from rabbits and rodents, such as squirrels, voles and muskrats, to humans
through dog tick bites. People can also catch the disease by eating or
coming in contact with an infected animal, contaminated water or soil [as
well as by inhalation, consumption of a contaminated animal, in laboratory
accidents, and (in some locations) bites of mosquitoes or deer flies -DS.
Deer ticks do not carry the disease. The infected people have been males
between the ages of 13 and 59, according to the Martha's Vineyard Gazette,
and most of the infected people have outdoor occupations such as
landscaping and construction work. The others mow their own lawns.
Tularemia comes on suddenly with symptoms that include swollen glands
[lymphadenopathy, a high fever, chills, fatigue, headache, a sore throat,
sore joints, chest discomfort, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea and a dry
cough [ulcers, either with or without associated lymphadenopathy, and
ocular involvement, either with or without associated lymphadenopathy are
other common presentations. -Man. Ed. DS. Symptoms generally appear three
to five days after an exposure to the bacteria, although they can take as
long as 14 days to appear [actually up to 21 days and can appear after less
than a 3 day incubation period as well -DS. Pawelec said that generally
one to 3 people are diagnosed each year with the disease. "Ten confirmed
cases is unusual," Pawelec said. "The last time there was a death was a
woman from Duxbury in 1996." The last time there was an outbreak on the
Vineyard was in the 1970s, Gaillard said. Some health officials speculate
that wet weather this summer may have contributed to the sharp rise in
tularemia because the bacteria remain alive much longer in damp weather.

The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) has notified us that
there is a cluster of pneumonic tularemia cases in Martha's Vineyard. To
date there have been 10 confirmed cases, 4 probable cases, and one suspect
case. Some of the diagnosed cases have been Boston residents who visited
Martha's Vineyard. Investigation by MDPH and the CDC to date has identified
no common source of exposure.
Tularemia is caused by _Francisella tularensis_. Symptoms of infection can
vary, but may include sudden onset of high fever, chills, headache,
malaise, anorexia and fatigue. In addition, cough, myalgias, sore throat,
chest discomfort, vomiting, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and skin ulcers can
occur. The bacteria is usually transmitted through the bite of an infected
arthropod (in Massachusetts the dog tick is responsible for transmission),
direct contact with infected animals, ingestion of contaminated water or
inadequately cooked meat, or inhalation of contaminated particles.
Person-to-person transmission has not been documented. The incubation
period usually ranges from 3 to 5 days, but can be as long as 21 days.
In Boston, please report any suspected or confirmed cases of tularemia to
the Boston Public Health Commission Communicable Disease Control Program
(phone number 617-534-5611). Reports can also be sent by fax
(617-534-5905). Thank you.

[Martha's Vineyard is an island vacation spot off the coast of
Massachusetts on which a number of tick-borne diseases are endemic, and
this is one way in which tularemia can be acquired. Tularemia is a zoonotic
infection caused by _Francisella tularensis_, a highly infectious
Gram-negative bacillus. There is a vaccine strain that is used to protect
research personnel who are at risk, but it has never, to my knowledge, been
recommended for general use. Currently, there are a relatively small number
of research laboratories in the world studying this organism, and some of
them are involved in projects to develop improved vaccines. There is
renewed interest among agencies that fund basic research of late because of
the potential of this agent for use in bioterrorist activities. - Mod.ES
[The possibility of inhalation of organisms as the cause of the outbreak on
Martha's Vineyard is being considered. Transmission via aerosol has been
well described, and has even caused large epidemics. See Dahlstrand S.,
Ringertz O, and Zetterberg B. Airborne tularemia in Sweden. Scand J Infect
Dis 3:7-16, 1971. The disease also occurs in Massachusetts on Nantucket.
For an interesting historical background on the disease in the area, I
would suggest Dr. Philip Brachman's editorial: _Francisella tularensis_ in
New England. NEJM 280:1296-7, 1969. For a discussion of a recent case of
pulmonary tularemia acquired in Nantucket, see: Shapiro D., Mark E. Case
records of the Massachusetts General Hospital. Weekly clinicopathological
exercises. A 60-year-old farm worker with bilateral pneumonia. New England
Journal of Medicine, 342:1430-1438, 2000. A truly comprehensive source on
tularemia is W.L. Jellison's book, Tularemia in North America, published by
the University of Montana in 1974. -Man. Ed. DS
