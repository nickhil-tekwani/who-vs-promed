El Salvador declares dengue epidemic
------------------------------------
SAN SALVADOR: Health authorities in El Salvador have declared an epidemic
of dengue fever in 5 of the nation's 14 provinces and put the rest of the
tiny country on red alert for the mosquito-borne disease. The disease has
killed 6 children under the age of 10 since January and spread to 595
people, including 102 with the more severe hemorrhagic strain, a Health
Ministry spokesmen said on Saturday. Health Minister Jose Lopez Beltran has
warned that if it is not brought under control, dengue may kill up to 25
people by year's end, the spokesmen said. The 5 provinces declared to have
epidemic levels are San Salvador, La Paz and La Libertad in the center of
the country and Sonsonate and Ahuachapan in the west.
Dengue fever, for which there is no vaccine, causes unbearable muscle and
joint pains, high fevers and severe headaches. In its most potent form,
hemorrhagic dengue, it can cause internal bleeding and death. A 1995
epidemic of dengue fever killed 5 people.

Dengue Outbreak Threatens Honduras
----------------------------------
TEGUCIGALPA : The Honduran Public Health Ministry will maintain the state
of alert along the country's borders with Guatemala and El Salvador owing
to an outbreak of hemorrhagic dengue fever which has already killed at
least 10 people this year. The first deadly case of dengue fever in
Guatemala was confirmed Wednesday, while health authorities in El Salvador
reported that 9 people have already died of the disease, 2 of them on
Sunday. The Honduran Public Health Ministry Epidemiology Chief, Marco
Antonio Pinel, said that the spread of the disease was "under relative
control" in Honduras, but that the nationwide alert would continue since
outbreaks are most likely between May and September. Honduras will step up
its efforts to control the disease along its borders with Guatemala and El
Salvador, Pinel said. Six cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever and 3,292 cases
of classic dengue have been reported this year in Honduras, 34 percent less
than the same period last year. In El Salvador, 132 cases of hemorrhagic
dengue and 733 cases of classic dengue fever have been reported this year.
Health authorities have documented a total of 2 749 cases of classic dengue
in Guatemala - mostly in the provinces of Zacapa, Juitiapa, Santa Rosa,
Escuintla and Quetzaltenago. A special health perimeter has been
established along the border with El Salvador.
