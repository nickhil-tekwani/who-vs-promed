Avian influenza A (H10N7) virus involvement in mass mortality of harbour seals (_Phoca vitulina_) in Sweden, March through October 2014. Authors: S Zohari, A Neimanis, T Harkonen, C Moraeus, J F Valarcher.
-----------------------------------------
We provide the 1st scientific report of influenza A virus involvement in a mass mortality event among harbour seals (_Phoca vitulina_) off the west coast of Sweden. Avian influenza A (H10N7) virus was detected in the lungs of 2 affected animals. This subtype has not been reported in seals to date, nor has influenza A-associated mortality been reported in seals in Europe. Circulation of avian influenza viruses in mammals may have implications for public health.
