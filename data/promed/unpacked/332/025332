Bovine spongiform encephalopathy in Canada
------------------------------------------
Follow-up report No. 2. Information received on 12 June 2003 from Dr Brian
Evans, executive director, Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), Ottawa:
End of previous report period: 3 June 2003 (see Disease Information 2003;
16[23]: 135, 6 June). End of this report period: 11 June 2003.
Since the 20 May 2003 announcement that a cow from a northern Alberta farm
had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), no other cattle have tested
positive. A total of 18 farms were quarantined as part of the BSE
investigation. Six farms remain quarantined, all of which are in Alberta.
Regarding the feed component of the investigation, quarantine has now been
lifted on all three farms in this line of inquiry. All tests have come back
negative. Any required feed clean-up has been completed.
As part of the extended trace-out investigation, it was found that 5 bulls
had been exported to the United States of America (USA) in early 1997 from
one of the herds that had been quarantined. Identification of these animals
was provided to the importing country.
In total, about 2700 cattle have been removed from farms and they have all
been destroyed. Rapid diagnostic testing has been completed and all results
are negative. The traditional tests are partially completed and all are
negative to date. Negative results means that the incidence of BSE in
Canada remains confined to one cow.
On 7 and 8 June 2003, a team of international experts (from New Zealand,
Switzerland, and the USA) reviewed the epidemiological investigation and
response to the finding of this single positive animal and validated the
findings. They concurred that the active investigation stage has achieved
its maximum potential. Recommendations from their preliminary report will
focus on possible amended policy approaches. No carcasses of quarantined
animals have gone into the animal or human food chain.
Updates are being provided on the CFIA's website under the title "BSE
disease investigation in Western Canada"
