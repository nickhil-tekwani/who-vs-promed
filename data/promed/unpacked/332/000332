Avian influenza situation in China
----------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in China has announced a new confirmed human
case of [avian influenza] H5N1 [virus] infection. The patient is a
22-year-old pregnant female from Hubei Province. She had onset of
symptoms on 23 May 2010 and died on 3 Jun 2010. Investigations into
the source of her infection indicate exposure to sick and dead
poultry. Close contacts of the patient are being monitored and to date
all remain well.

Of the 39 cases confirmed to date in China, 26 have been fatal.

[This is the WHO confirmation of the fatal case of avian influenza
(H5N1) virus infection previously reported in the ProMED-mail as:
Avian influenza, human (39): China (HU), fatal 20100604.1854. The
patient's infection has been attributed to exposure to sick and dead
poultry. However, there has been no independent confirmation of
outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 virus infection in poultry in
Hubei province at the present time. Further information on the origin
of this patient's infection would be welcomed.
