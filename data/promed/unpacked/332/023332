On 30 Jan 2014, the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC) of China notified WHO of 7 additional laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus including one death.

Of these 7 cases, 4 are male. The age range is 56 to 78 years old. The cases have been reported from Guangdong (1), Guangxi (1), Jiangsu (1), and Zhejiang (4). For Guangxi Province, this is the 1st laboratory confirmed case of human infection with avian influenza A(H7N9). Six of the cases are currently in a critical or serious condition. Seven of the cases are reported to have had exposure to poultry or a live poultry market.

Details of the cases notified by NHFPC are as follows:

- a 75 year old farmer from Ningpo City, Zhejiang Province, who became ill on 21 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 24 Jan 2014. He is currently in a critical condition The patient has a history of exposure to a live poultry market.
- a 76 year old man from Ningpo City, Zhejiang Province, who became ill on 21 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 24 Jan 2014 and transferred to another hospital on 27 Jan 2014. He is currently in a critical condition. He has a history of exposure to a poultry market.
- a 78 year old farmer from Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, who became ill on 25 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 27 Jan 2014 and transferred to another hospital on 29 Jan 2014. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to a live poultry market.
- a 64 year old man from Ningpo City, Zhejiang Province, who became ill on 13 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 16 Jan 2014. He is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to a live poultry market.
- a 75 year old woman from Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province, who became ill on 18 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 25 Jan 2014. She is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to a live poultry market.
- a 67 year old woman from Jiangmen City, Guangdong Province, who became ill on 24 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 25 Jan 2014. She died on 28 Jan 2014. The patient had a history of exposure to live poultry.
- a 56 year old woman from Hezhou City, Guangxi Province, who became ill on 20 Jan 2014 and was admitted to hospital on 27 Jan 2014. She is currently in a critical condition. The patient has a history of exposure to a live poultry market.

So far, there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission.

The Chinese government continues to take the following surveillance and control measures:
- strengthen surveillance and situation analysis;
- reinforce case management and treatment;
- conduct risk communication with the public and release information;
- strengthen international collaboration and communication; and
- conduct scientific studies.

While the recent report of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus being detected in live poultry imported from the mainland to Hong Kong SAR shows the potential for the virus to spread through live poultry, at this time, there is no indication that international spread of avian influenza A(H7N9) has occurred through humans or animals.

Further sporadic human cases of A(H7N9) infection are expected in affected and possibly neighbouring areas, especially given expected increases in the trade and transport of poultry associated with the Lunar New Year celebrations.

WHO advises that travellers to countries with known outbreaks of avian influenza should avoid poultry farms or contact with animals in live bird markets or entering areas where poultry may be slaughtered or contact with any surfaces that appear to be contaminated with faeces from poultry or other animals. Travellers should also wash their hands often with soap and water. Travellers should follow good food safety and good food hygiene practices.

WHO does not advise special screening at points of entry with regard to this event nor does it currently recommend any travel or trade restrictions.

As always, a diagnosis of infection with an avian influenza virus should be considered in individuals who develop severe acute respiratory symptoms while travelling or soon after returning from an area where avian influenza is a concern.

WHO encourages countries to continue strengthening influenza surveillance, including surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), and to carefully review any unusual patterns in order to ensure reporting of human infections under the IHR (2005) and continue national health preparedness actions.
