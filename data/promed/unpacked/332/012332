The "most significant conservation disaster ever" may be about to
repeat itself around the world, according to research by the Royal
Society for the Protection of Birds.
Conservationists, already dismayed by the death of millions of
vultures in India, Nepal and Pakistan, caused by the birds consuming
a cattle drug, have found other bird species are also susceptible.
The anti-inflammatory drug diclofenac is toxic to 3 species of Asian
vulture -- the oriental white-backed, long-billed and slender-billed.
They die from kidney failure if they eat the carcasses of cattle
treated with it.
Conservationists estimate that 10-14 million birds have died;
populations are still declining at 30 to 50 percent a year. "It's
probably the most significant conservation disaster ever in terms of
the number of birds lost," said Jemima Parry-Jones at the US National
Aviary in Pittsburgh.
Dr Parry-Jones and the RSPB research team set out to discover whether
diclofenac and related drugs are toxic to other birds. They asked zoo
vets around the world for reports of unintentional bird deaths after
treatment with the drugs. Of the 79 scavenging birds they received
information on, the drugs were deadly for 30 percent, including the
African white-backed vulture, saw-whet owl from North America, harris
hawk, spoonbill, Eurasian gryphon vulture and African maribu stork.
The researchers reported their results in the journal Biology Letters.
The manufacture and import of diclofenac was banned in India in
August [2006], although it is not illegal to sell off stockpiles. It
is banned in the US and Europe, but is still used in parts of Africa
and South America.
