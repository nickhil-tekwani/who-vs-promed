["Rabies is entirely preventable, and vaccines, medicines, tools and technologies have long been available to prevent people from dying of dog-mediated rabies. Nevertheless, rabies still kills about 60 000 people a year, of whom over 40% are children under 15, mainly in rural areas of economically disadvantaged countries in Africa and Asia.

"Of all human cases, up to 99% are acquired from the bite of an infected dog. The estimated cost of rabies is approximately USD 8.6 billion per year, of which 54% is for productivity losses due to premature deaths, 37% is for treatment of humans bitten by dogs suspected of being rabid and only 2% is spent on dog vaccination and population control.

"The cost of dog vaccination - the most effective measure of rabies control - is a negligible component of the losses due to the disease. For a relatively low budget, the disease could be eliminated, with thousands of lives saved. Dog-mediated human rabies can be eliminated by tackling the disease at its source: infected dogs. Making people aware of how to avoid the bites of rabid dogs, to seek treatment when bitten and to vaccinate animals can disrupt the rabies transmission cycle. Thus, dog vaccination programs applied massively, with ensured access to human post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), can save thousands of lives".
