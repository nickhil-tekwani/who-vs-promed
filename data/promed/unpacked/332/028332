Today, Monday [17 Jan 2022], an official in the Iranian Ministry of Health announced the spread of leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease transmitted to humans through sandfly bites, in 18 out of 31 Iranian provinces, with more than 10 000 people infected with this disease.

The head of the Human and Animal Infectious Diseases Management Group at the Iranian Ministry of Health, Behzad Amiri, said in press statements that, "since the beginning of the Iranian year on 21 Mar 2021, and until the end of last December [2021], 10 508 new patients were identified with the disease leishmaniasis in the country."

"The provinces of Isfahan, Fars, Khuzestan, Semnan, Khorasan Razavi and Golestan recorded the highest rate of infection with this disease," Amiri added, noting that "Iran is facing a significant increase in the number of infections with this disease." In a related context, Mohammad Mahdi Joya, head of the Center for Infectious Diseases Management at the Iranian Ministry of Health, said that the accumulation of garbage and animal excrement in villages is a factor in the outbreak.

Mahdi Joya said: "If anyone is infected, and the infection lasts more than 10 days and does not heal, they must go to the health centers," adding, "If we move quickly, we can hope to control the disease quickly." "We are facing a disease that is much easier to control than it was in the past," the Iranian official explained.

Iranian reports confirm that "the spread of leishmaniasis in parts of Tehran is occurring in the cities of Waramin and the village of Muhammadabad, south of the capital."

According to the Tehran Province Management and Planning Organization, more than 4 million people in Tehran live in informal and marginal settlements, without access to amenities, sanitation and even safe drinking water. In recent years, with the spread of poverty and economic hardship, the population of the suburbs of Tehran has grown, and a large number of citizens have taken refuge in areas where waste accumulates due to the inability to pay rent, which makes people vulnerable and infected with this disease.

[Cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic in Iran; see the ProMED posting from 15 Jan 2022 listed below. The reservoir for _Leishmania_ species in Iran is small rodents. The note in the text above that "accumulation of garbage and animal excrement in villages is a factor in the outbreak" underlines that uncontrolled expansion of rodents may be the key to understand the increase in cases.

A recent study looked at socioeconomic and environmental risk factors and incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis in high-risk areas of Iran: see Firouraghi N, Mohammadi A, Hamer DH, et al.
