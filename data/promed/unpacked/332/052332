3 new foci of FMD have been confirmed in Brazil in the township of Careiro
da Varzea, in Amazonas state close to the capital, Manaus. Nearly 1200 head
of cattle and water buffalo are affected, and 1 goat. The virus isolated is
type C.
Brazil has just begun to vaccinate 5.6 million animals in 6 states
(Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraiba, Rio Grande do Norte, Amazonas, and Roraima)
with a FMD vaccine that includes type C.
The initial focus this year was detected in June [2004], in Monte Alegre
township, Para state -- see ref. below -- and was the 1st report for 34
months. Brazil has the world's largest national herd of cattle, and 88
percent are [in zones] free of FMD. The authorities consider that this
outbreak represents a low risk of spread, since it is 500 km from the
internationally recognized zone free of FMD.
