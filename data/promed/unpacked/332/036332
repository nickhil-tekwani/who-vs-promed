ROSTOV-ON-DON. An epidemic of German measles has broken out in the Don
region. Over the past two months the number of people who contracted German
measles in the region totalled 11,000, which is 1.5 times more than the
number of measles cases registered in the whole of last year. Big cities
such as Rostov-on-Don, Shakhty and Taganrog have been the worst hit by the
disease.
Officials from the regional Sanitary Epidemiologic Inspectorate told
Itar-Tass on Friday that the epidemic had been predicted because no money
arrived to vaccinate the population against German measles although the
vaccination against the disease was included into a national vaccination
calender by the Russian Health Ministry.
Therefore, the administrations of cities and regions have to tackle this
problem on their own, but their efforts to prevent the epidemic have not
been sufficient.
Note: Rostov-on-Don is located in the south of Russia (1,200 km from
Moscow) on the crossroad of the North Caucasus, Central Russia and the
Ukraine. The city is a port city on the Don River. The province of Don
borders with the Ukraine and the Black Sea. Given the close proximity to
the Ukraine, Armenia and Georgia, one wonders if there has been widespread
rubella activity in this area. - MPP
