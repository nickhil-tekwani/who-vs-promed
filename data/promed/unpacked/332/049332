Hepatitis cases tied to one doctor's office in New Jersey
---------------------------------------------------------
Several thousand patients of a New Jersey doctor should get tested
for blood-borne diseases because of an outbreak linked to his office
that has led to more than 2 dozen being diagnosed with hepatitis B,
state health officials said. In March [2009], the state said 5 of Dr.
Parvez Dara's patients were found to have hepatitis B and that nearly
2800 patients should get tested for it. There are now 29 positive
cases, plus 68 others who tested positive for antibodies but cannot
be definitely linked to the outbreak, according to the state Health
Department. The state is aware of nearly 1400 patients who have been
tested so far.

On 12 Aug 2009, state epidemiologist Dr. Christina Tan sent a letter
to 2000 more patients and to patients in the 1st group who had yet to
get tested urging them to do so. In July 2009, the department
responded to an Associated Press open records request by declining to
release any information about the test results, citing the ongoing
investigation. The department quietly released the test results on
its Web site 1 Sep 2009, nearly 3 weeks after sending out the letter
to patients. Health Department spokeswoman Donna Leusner said the
investigation is ongoing, but a report was prepared at the request of
the Board of Medical Examiners, which suspended Dara's license in April 2009.

A spokesman for Dara criticized the health department for releasing
the test results while the investigation is still open, saying it was
a "rush to judgment." "There are a number of possible medical reasons
that explain why hepatitis B may have developed among patients --
particularly those being treated for cancer with chemotherapy," said
Dara spokesman Tim White.

Health inspectors visited Dara's office in March [2009] and described
conditions there as unsanitary. The inspectors said they found blood
on the floor of a room where chemotherapy was administered, blood in
a bin where blood vials were stored, unsterile saline and gauze, and
open medication vials. Inspectors also cited problems with
cross-contamination of pens, refrigerators and countertops; use of
contaminated gloves; and misuse of antiseptics, among other health
code violations.

Following the inspection, county health officials sent a 28 Mar 2009
letter to Dara's patients warning them of the risk and suggesting
they be tested for the liver diseases hepatitis B and hepatitis C and
for HIV [human immunodeficiency virus], the virus that causes AIDS
[acquired immune deficiency syndrome].

"Evidence gathered at this time suggests that since 2002, some clinic
staff provided care in a manner that put patients at risk for
infection caused by blood-borne viruses, including hepatitis B
[virus]," the 12 Aug 2009 letter told patients. "The investigation to
date suggests that the hepatitis B infections identified may be
associated with the method by which medications were administered and
procedures performed at the practice."

Dara, originally from Pakistan, has been practicing at his Toms
River, New Jersey, office for 23 years and has been a licensed
oncologist in New Jersey since 1980. He estimated that he saw 45 to
60 patients a day, with about a dozen receiving chemotherapy each day.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Brent Barrett

[A large number of patients treated at Dr. Dara's clinic before his
suspension remain to be screened for possible infection with
hepatitis B or other blood-borne viruses. Consequently the alert
remains in place.

The investigation conducted by the Health Department into this
incident has revealed evidence of serious lapses in the
administration of medication and poor standards of general hygiene
and cleanliness.
