There has been an increase in the number of cases of syphilis in the Tel Aviv district in the last 2 years, primarily among refugees and foreign workers, the Health Ministry reported on Thursday [7 May 2015].

In addition to sexual transmission, it can also be transmitted by mothers to their fetuses during pregnancy (congenital syphilis).

The number of reported cases rose significantly from 38 in 2012 to 112 last year [2014].

Syphilis is caused by a subspecies of the spirochete bacterium _Treponema pallidum_. Depending on when it is diagnosed, the symptoms may include ulceration of the skin of sexual organs, a rash usually on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, or neurological or cardiac problems at a late stage. Untreated, it causes death in 58 percent of cases. The disease can be diagnosed through blood tests or through a process called dark-field microscopy. Treatment is by antibiotics given by injection or intravenously.

The prevalence of syphilis declined after antibiotics became available in the 1940s, but rose again since 2000 in numerous countries, often together with HIV/AIDS and among homosexual men. Unprotected sex with prostitutes and numerous partners raises the risk of contracting additional infections such as gonorrhea, chlamydia, human papilloma virus (that can cause cervical cancer) and HIV, the ministry said. It can also be spread via oral sex. There is no protective vaccine.

The health authorities urge those at high risk for syphilis to go periodically to a specialized clinic or one's own physician. If there is a diagnosis of syphilis, one must inform sexual partners to be checked and if necessary, treated.

The Tel Aviv District Health Office runs the free Levinsky Clinic for the anonymous diagnosis and prevention of venereal diseases; there is another in Haifa. The Tel Aviv clinic is located at the new central bus station. Call (03) 537- 3738 for an appointment.

[Please see the moderator's comments in prior ProMED-mail posts on syphilis for discussions of this disease.

The news report above says that there is a rise in the frequency of syphilis in the Tel Aviv area, but does not indicate any characteristics of those with syphilis, other than saying that the disease is occurring primarily among refugees and foreign workers (in contrast to native Israelis) and does not indicate if this increased frequency is due to new versus old infection. A more detailed description of the epidemiology from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated.

This increase in syphilis cases in refugees and foreign workers could be due in part to increased targeted syphilis testing in this particular segment of the population. Indeed, syphilis testing is done in refugees to the U.S. when they undergo health screening prior to resettlement in the United States (http://www.cdc.gov/immigrantrefugeehealth/guidelines/domestic/sexually-transmitted-diseases.html). However, a study among blood donors for the period 2005-2009 found similarly that new immigrants (immigration year in or prior to 1990) to Israel from Africa, Eastern Europe, and South America had a significantly higher risk for syphilis, similar to the risk in their countries of origin, compared to that of Israeli-born donors and those who immigrated before 1990 (http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jbt/2014/154048). From 1990 to 2001 more than 900 000 immigrants came to Israel (13 percent of the total Israeli population), mostly from the former Soviet Union and from Africa (http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jbt/2014/154048).

Tel Aviv, located on the Mediterranean coast in west-central Israel, forms part of the Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area, which constitutes Israel's largest metropolitan area with 42 percent of the country's population (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv). Tel Aviv is said to have the 2nd-largest economy in the Middle East after Dubai, with 2.5 million international visitors annually (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv). - Mod.ML
