Utah County health officials issued a warning against raw milk
consumption after 7 cases of a potentially severe foodborne illness
were linked to products from the same dairy.
Utah's Department of Agriculture and Food issued a notice of
investigation Wednesday [21 Mar 2007] to Woolsey's Dairy in Payson,
where the sick consumers said they purchased raw milk. State
investigators are collecting milk samples at the dairy that will be
tested through the weekend, said Richard Clark, who oversees the
division in charge of dairy regulation.
"It will help us be able to determine if the milk currently being
produced is contaminated or not and it will help us locate and focus
on whether it's in the animal or in the production," he said.
There have been 15 confirmed cases of the illness and 7 of the cases
were traced back to raw milk from Woolsey's Dairy. All of the cases
have tested positive for _Campylobacter_, a common bacterial
infection that can cause diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, and
fever that can last about a week, health department spokesman Lance
Madigan said.
Severe cases can result in a life-threatening infection. Most people
fall ill within one to 10 days after exposure. Doctors are required
to report the disease, which was first brought to the health
department's attention on Mon 19 Mar 2007, he said.
Only one person has been hospitalized and several of the sick are
from the same family.
Last year [2006], the county recorded 39 cases of the disease, but
not all were linked to the consumption of raw food products, Madigan
said. "You can contract it in other ways. It's not necessarily a
given that it came from raw milk. We're still investigating," Madigan said.
Epidemiologists are conducting DNA tests and looking at 16 markers to
determine if all 15 cases are linked, he said.
Woolsey's Dairy produces about 100 gallons of raw milk daily and is
believed to sell that within a 48-hour period, Clark said. Dairies
are inspected 4 times annually. Clark did not know when the dairy had
last been inspected or if there was a documented history of problems there.
Health department officials recommend consumers discard any recently
purchased raw milk and see a doctor if they begin to suffer any
symptoms of the illness.

[In 2005, the most recent year from which data has been published by
CDC (U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), (see
<http://www.cdc.gov/foodborneoutbreaks/us_outb/fbo2005/2005_Linelist.pdf>),
there were 19 foodborne outbreaks documented due to _Campylobacter
jejuni_ (and 2 others in which the species was not stated) in the
USA, 7 related to unpasteurized milk out of the 16 in which a vehicle
was identified and one related to pasteurized milk.
This paragraph is adapted from ProMED-mail post E. coli O157,
unpasteurized milk, 2005 - USA (WA) 20070302.0741:
"Raw milk is a well-documented cause of enteric infections and was
1st recognized as such about 100 years ago. Pathogens that infect
humans, including _Campylobacter_, are shed in the feces of cows and
can contaminate milk during the milking process. Using standard
hygiene practices during milking (such as, washing hands, keeping
equipment clean, and keeping the milking area separated from other
areas) can reduce but not eliminate the risk for milk contamination.
Pasteurization decreases the number of pathogenic organisms, prevents
transmission of pathogens, and has been determined to improve the
safety of raw milk more than other measures, including certification
of raw milk. Because raw milk certification has failed to prevent
many raw milk-associated infections in the past, consumers should not
assume that certified raw milk is free of pathogens. To prevent
salmonella and other infections, consumers should not drink raw milk."
In a number of states, cow-share programs and the regulated sale of
raw milk are legal. As of February 2007, raw milk could be sold
legally in 27 states.
During 1973-1992, a total of 40 (87 percent) of the 46 reported raw
milk-associated illness outbreaks occurred in states in which the
intrastate sale of raw milk was legal. State milk regulations and
methods for their enforcement should be reviewed and strengthened to
minimize the hazards of raw milk.
An article from today's (22 Mar 2007) Cleveland (OH) Plain Dealer
<http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/news/117455271966790.xml&coll=2>,
underscores the Public Health difficulties in dealing with
unpasteurized milk, edited as follows:
"Gov. Ted Strickland ordered the Ohio Department of Agriculture to
stop its effort to prevent a western Ohio dairy farm from supplying
raw milk to shareholders. Strickland told the department to drop its
appeal of a judge's ruling that overturned the state's decision to
revoke the farmer's milk-producing license.
Darke County Common Pleas Judge Jonathan Hein ruled in December
(2006) that state agriculture officials failed to show that the farm
in question illegally provided raw milk to 165 shareholders.
Farmers in Ohio cannot sell raw milk for human consumption, although
they can drink the unpasteurized milk from their own cows. The farmer
operated a herd-share program that allowed people to pay USD 50 for a
share in a cow, plus USD 6 a gallon (3.8 lt.) for the milk, instead
of selling the milk directly. She argued it was not illegal because
those who got the milk owned part of the cow.
The herd-share program factored in to Strickland's decision,
spokesman Keith Dailey said.
Supporters of raw milk say it is full of vitamins and does not bother
those who are lactose intolerant. But health officials warn milk that
hasn't been pasteurized to kill _E. coli_ and other bacteria could
make drinkers sick."
