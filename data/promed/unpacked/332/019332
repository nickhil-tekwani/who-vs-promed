The Alabama Department of Public Health [ADPH] has detected multiple cases of tuberculosis in Dothan over the past 2 years and expressed frustration Friday [23 Feb 2018] over what the department says is a lack of cooperation from downtown nightclubs that have been identified as a common denominator in the cases.

The department, in a written release, identified The Blue Bar, Chill Lounge, Club Escape, The G-Spot, and Imani Loungebar, specifically. "Numerous attempts have been made to reach out to the affected clubs for assistance in combating this public health threat, with very little success," the department stated in the release.

In an attempt to determine the breadth of the cases in the area, a TB testing event is scheduled for Tue 27 Feb 2018 at the Houston County Health Department at 1781 East Cottonwood Road. Anyone who has frequented the nightclubs mentioned is urged to attend the testing. The 1st 300 people will be given USD 20 WalMart gift cards.

"Our concern is that many more people are infected and do not realize it," Pam Barrett, director of the ADPH TB Control Division, said in the release. "We strongly encourage anyone who has frequented any of the following venues over the past year to follow up for a TB test."

Barrett said individuals can be infected with the tuberculosis germ [_Mycobacterium tuberculosis_] without feeling sick or having any other symptoms. A test can detect whether the germ is present and can be treated with medication.

Barrett told the Dothan Eagle that 8 cases spanning a period of about 2 years have been directly linked to the clubs.

Barrett said the department reached out to the clubs almost 2 years ago and asked owners to pass out fliers to patrons. The fliers asked patrons to seek a TB test. Barrett said almost no one responded, leading the department to believe the fliers were not being distributed. Recently, after more cases were detected, Barrett said the department made business cards with similar wording and asked clubs to distribute them. Only 2 people sought a test, and neither said they received the card while visiting any of the nightclubs mentioned.

The owner of Club Escape disputes the assertion the club has not cooperated with the most recent effort to get word to its patrons. Avi Grantham, owner of Club Escape in Dothan, said she personally handed out cards to more than 150 patrons recently and put informational pamphlets in the club's restrooms. Grantham and her husband, Josh, said they were doing their best to respond to the latest request. "I can't speak for any of the other clubs or what they were doing, but I can speak for Club Escape," Josh Grantham said.

Josh Grantham said he and his wife were both tested for TB and are now "more informed" about the illness than they were 2 years ago when the cases were 1st detected.

[Dothan, with a population of 65 496 as of the 2010 census, is a city in Dale, Henry, and Houston counties in the U.S. state of Alabama; located in the state's southeastern corner, approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of the Georgia state line and 16 miles (26 km) north of Florida, it is the county seat of Houston County (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dothan,_Alabama).

ProMED-mail has posted several reports of community outbreaks of tuberculosis in the past, for example, in Singapore (Tuberculosis, MDR - Singapore: (AMK) neighborhood outbreak, RFI 20160618.4294856) and in Shanghai (Tuberculosis, MDR - China: (Shanghai) primary, neighborhood outbreaks, 2009-2012 20161216.4702532).

Transmission of tuberculosis usually requires close, repeated or prolonged contact with a contagious individual in a poorly ventilated environment, which occurs in households or institutions, such as homeless shelters. However, in Singapore, a neighborhood outbreak extended over a 4-year period, linked to a 2012 outbreak of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR) TB that involved 6 cases of MDR TB, 5 of whom frequented 3 cybercafes at a shopping mall; the 6th case was a family member. All 6 individuals had isolates of _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ with a matching genotype.

The MDR TB outbreak in Shanghai was similar to that in Singapore in that most cases with matching genotypes did not have anything in common other than living in the same neighborhood or using the same public facilities such as food markets. Only a small number of cases were traced to household contacts.

The news report above of the tuberculosis outbreak in Dothan, says that multiple cases of tuberculosis in Dothan over the past 2 years are linked to several downtown nightclubs; however, the news report fails to give details, such as the number of cases, their ages or any other characteristic, whether the isolates of _M. tuberculosis_ were MDR, and whether the isolates were genetically linked. More information on this outbreak would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
