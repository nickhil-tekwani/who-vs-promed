ProMED-mail posted a notice [archive 980125011027 to the effect that the
U.S. Department of Agriculture has lifted its Venezuelan equine
encephalitis (VEE) quarantine of horses arriving from Mexico. Prior to
that notice, USDA had required a 7-day period in vector-proof quarantine
facilities for horses intended for import into the U.S. from Mexico. The
official statement from Dr. Joan Arnoldi, Deputy Administrator of
Veterinary Services with the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service
was: "We have determined Mexico to be free of Venezuelan equine
encephalomyelitis. Lifting the seven-day quarantine requirement would not
pose a risk of transmitting VEE to horses in the United States".
Dr. Arnoldi is quite right in this regard but there remains a technical
omission, unrelated to the principal question. I address that omission
here, in hope of clarifying the terminology.
Venezuelan equine encephalitis is a disease. To state that any country is
free of VEE or any other disease is reasonable if there is no evidence for
the presence of the disease in that country.
However, there is a molecular, antigenic, and ecologic complex of viruses
called "VEE virus". These have been placed in the family Togaviridae,
genus _Alphavirus_. In brief summary, there is one virus (VEE), six
subtypes (I-VI), and numerous varieties of those subtypes, but only a few
of them have been associated with disease, and they have different
arthropod vectors, different ecosystems, and different geographic
distributions. The enzootic VEE complex viruses are maintained between
rodents by mosquitoes, most commonly of the genus _Culex (Melanoconion)_.
Historically, there have been at least three distinguishable "VEE" viruses
detected in Mexico, one of which are known to cause illness in equids, VEE
IAB virus, last detected in North America and Central America in 1972. A
second VEE virus, VEE IE, is enzootic in Mexico. Most of the time, VEE IE
does not cause disease in equids, just as VEE II (Everglades) virus occurs
enzootically (mosquitoes, rodents) in south Florida and does not cause
disease in equids there. We only have serologic evidence (C.H. Calisher,
unpublished data) for the presence of VEE IC virus in Mexico.
Subtype IE viruses were responsible for two recent outbreaks of equine
encephalitis in Mexico, in 1993 in Chiapas State and in 1996 in Oaxaca
State. The etiology was confirmed by virus isolation, and antigenic and
genetic characterization of two isolates from each outbreak.
Panama has never had clinical VEE of any kind. The 4 or 5 documented
(virus isolated from sick horses) episodes of equine encephalomyelitis
caused by sylvatic variant IE virus were self-limiting infections, although
recent activities were addressed by use of TC-83 (attenuated VEE IAB virus)
vaccine. We do not know why VEE IE virus occasionally mutates to become
horse-virulent, but it has never caused "classical" epizootic VEE that
sweeps through susceptible equid populations over great distances -- VEE IE
virus appears only to "simmer" in focal areas and, in the past, terminated
without vaccine intervention.
Humans, equids, and mice immunized with VEE TC-83 vaccine respond with
adequate neutralizing antibody to VEE IAB, VEE IC, and less so to VEE ID,
VEE IE, (VEE IF not recognized at the time those tests were done), and
other VEE complex subtype viruses (Fillis CA and Calisher CH. Neutralizing
antibody responses of humans and mice to vaccination with Venezuelan
encephalitis [TC-83 virus, J Clin Microbiol 10:544-549, 1979).
Notwithstanding, when horses die from encephalomyelitis caused by VEE IE
virus, USDA is obligated to call it "VEE" and to respond with quarantines
and embargoes on the movement of equids from the country involved, just as
though the epizootic variant is responsible.
Mexico, the United States, Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras,
Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama have enzootic VEE virus variants or
subtypes, but no country from Panama north has had VEE (classical or other)
in horses in the past year.
Thus, although it is correct to state that Mexico is, at present, free of
VEE (the disease) there is no evidence to indicate that Mexico is free of
all the viruses of the VEE complex.
I emphasize that this has nothing whatsoever to do with the USDA notice.
This posting is simply an attempt to clarify the taxonomy of these viruses.
Many thanks to Tom Walton and Joan Arnoldi, USDA, and Bob Shope and Scott
Weaver, University of Texas/Galveston, for sharing their wisdom, comments,
and additions to a preliminary draft of this posting.
