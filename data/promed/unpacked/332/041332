A 30 year old woman has just returned home with her one year old daughter.
The child has a few red spots on her body, and the mother is afraid her
child may have measles. The illness has already claimed 11 lives in Dadu
district in the southern Sindh province, and the mother, who lives in a
village near the town of Dadu, says she is very worried. "She has a fever
too, and the midwife I took her to see is not certain what it is. We are
now going to take her to the local clinic." Midwives double as basic
healthcare providers in many rural areas, where facilities are scarce.

Thomas Gurtner, the principal humanitarian adviser for the UN in Sindh
province, told IRIN: "The death of 11 children due to measles has been
confirmed by health officials here." In response, health officials in Dadu
have ordered more vaccination centres to be opened in hospitals and for
vaccination drives at camps to be stepped up.

Eshtewi Abu Ziyad, World Health Organization (WHO) acting representative in
Hyderabad, Sindh province, told IRIN: "We started a big campaign against
measles, including a vaccination drive, that began before Eid-al-Adha [17
Nov 2010]. This is continuing, and we are discussing future plans and how
to proceed with UNICEF [the UN Children's Fund] and local health
authorities. "I am not sure yet if measles is totally under control. I
think a few more cases have been reported. We are assessing the situation."

About 4000 children have been vaccinated against measles in the past 2
weeks. "We now have 95 per cent coverage among IDPs [internally displaced
people], and I can say things are improving," Ziyad said. Measles has been
killing up to 58 children a day, and outbreaks continue to be reported from
various parts of the country.

The WHO estimates 2.1 million children are infected annually, resulting in
about 21 000 deaths each year due to complications. "The best means to
prevent measles is immunization, immunization and immunization. Other
important means are improved nutrition and doses of vitamin A, which
improves immune response," Gul Afridi, WHO media and advocacy officer, told
IRIN from Islamabad.

"In situations such as that created by the floods, when many people are
forced to live in close proximity to each other at camps, levels of hygiene
are poor and nutrition not always adequate; there is a greater chance of
all contagious illnesses spreading," said Abdul Ahmed, a physician in Dadu.

Lack of awareness plays a role too. "I had no idea measles could be
dangerous. My 3 children, all aged under 10, are not vaccinated, but after
hearing about the risks on TV, I plan to take them to a clinic and get the
shots," said one parent.

According to WHO, other than the deaths in Dadu, there have been 8 cases of
measles in Ghotki district in Sindh, 20 in Dadu, 11 in Kashmore and 3 in
Naushero Feroze district. Outside Sindh, one case has been reported from
the northern Khyber-Pakhtoonkh'wa province. Since the end of flooding, the
WHO has warned of a continued risk posed to victims by the spread of disease.

[In view of the contagiousness of measles and the apparent lack of
awareness of some of the population, the Pakistani Health authorities and
their international partners have done well to contain the measles outbreak
in the flood-stricken areas of the country.
