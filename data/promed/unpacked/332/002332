An emerging pathogen, once thought to be restricted to the Pacific Northwest, has appeared in New York State, a researcher said. In an unusual case, researchers isolated _Cryptococcus gattii_ from the cerebrospinal fluid and adrenal tissue of a 72-year-old lumberyard worker, according to Katie Warren, DO, of Albany Medical College in New York State. The man had never been outside New York and had no links to the Pacific Northwest in particular, Warren reported here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.

While the source of the infection hasn't been pinned down, Warren told MedPage Today, suspicion centers on the man's work environment, since _C. gattii_ is known to colonize wood. The finding "might represent a shift" in where the pathogen is likely to be found, Warren said.

But an outside expert told MedPage Today the finding might not represent an expansion of the fungal range but instead an improved ability to separate _C. gattii_ from its close cousin _Cryptococcus neoformans_.

"The pathogen has been, over the years, difficult to separate from _Cryptococcus neoformans_, and we're starting to recognize it's found in a lot of places we didn't look for it previously," said Nancy Wengenack, PhD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Because of the improved ability to diagnose _C. gattii_, "I expect we'll continue to see cases in different states in the USA and probably elsewhere," Wengenack said. Both pathogens can cause disease, she said, but _C. neoformans_ usually attacks immunosuppressed people, while _C. gattii_ can cause disease in people with an intact immune system.

_C. gattii_ had been thought to be mainly a tropical pathogen until the early years of this century, when it was discovered in the Pacific Northwest, causing more than 200 cases on Vancouver Island in Canada, and then about 100 cases in Oregon and Washington state. But the CDC has reported at least 25 cases outside of the region, including in California, Florida, and Georgia, among other places. The lumber worker appears to be the 1st case in the Northeast, Warren said, which suggests, among other things, that labs in the region testing for fungal infection should consider _C. gattii_, rather than just _C. neoformans_.

Interestingly, Warren said, the man did not present with the classical respiratory symptoms of _C. gattii_ infection -- shortness of breath, cough, and fever. Instead, he complained of slurred speech, which prompted physicians to think of a stroke or transient ischemic attack.

A neurologic exam as part of the standard stroke work-up was unremarkable, Warren said, but CT imaging found a small mass at the C1 level of the spinal cord, as well as a bilateral adrenal nodularity. Testing with polymerase chain reaction found _C. gattii_ in the cerebrospinal fluid and in adrenal tissue, she said, and the man was treated with 2 weeks of lipid-formulated amphotericin-B and 2 years of fluconazole. He has now cleared the infection and is clinically well.

[It seems that difficulties in differentiating _C. gattii_ from _C. neoformans_ can be a factor, as noted in the posting. It seemed that _C. gattii_ affects individuals with a normal immune system, but the recent publication in mBio suggest a specific subtle immune issue:

Saijo T, Chen J, Chen SC, et al: Anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor autoantibodies are a risk factor for central nervous system infection by Cryptococcus gattii in otherwise immunocompetent patients. MBio. 2014 Mar 18;5(2):e00912-14. doi: 10.1128/mBio.00912-14.

"Abstract
---------
Cryptococcosis is caused by either _Cryptococcus neoformans_ or _C. gattii_. While cryptococcal meningoencephalitis is caused mostly by _C. neoformans_ in immunocompromised patients, the risk factors remain unclear for patients with no known immune defect. Recently, anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) autoantibodies were detected in the plasma of 7 'immunocompetent' cryptococcosis patients, and the cryptococcal strains from these patients were reported as _C. neoformans_ (3 strains), _C. gattii_ (1 strain), and 3 strains not identified to the species level. We identified all 3 strains that had not been identified to the species level as _C. gattii_. Notably, the 3 strains that were reported as _C. neoformans_ but were unavailable for species confirmation originated from Southern California and Thailand where _C. gattii_ is endemic. Most clinical laboratories designate _C. neoformans_ without distinguishing between the 2 species; hence, these 3 strains could have been _C. gattii_.

Since _C. gattii_ infects more immunocompetent patients than _C. neoformans_, we pursued the possibility that this antibody may be more prevalent in patients infected with _C. gattii_ than in those infected with _C. neoformans_. We screened the plasma of 20 healthy controls and 30 'immunocompetent' patients with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis from China and Australia (multiple ethnicities). Anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies were detected only in the plasma of 7 patients infected by _C. gattii_ and a healthy volunteer and in none infected by _C. neoformans_. While plasma from these _C. gattii_ patients completely prevented GM-CSF-induced p-STAT5 in normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma from the healthy volunteer positive for anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies caused only partial blockage.

Our results suggest that anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies may predispose otherwise immunocompetent individuals to meningoencephalitis caused by _C. gattii_ but not necessarily to that caused by _C. neoformans_. GM-CSF may have a specific role in host defense against _C. gattii_, thereby elevating the importance of determining the level of anti-GM-CSF autoantibodies which can impact clinical management."
