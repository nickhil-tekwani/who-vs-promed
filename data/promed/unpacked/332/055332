Paraguayan authorities are on the verge of declaring a nationwide state of
emergency as a result of a dengue fever epidemic that threatens the capital
and has spread through several outlying areas. More than 5000 cases have
been officially reported, 700 of which have already been confirmed at
public health centers, but the number could reach 10 000 nationwide, Health
Minister Martin Chiola said. The strain detected in Paraguay is classic
dengue fever, which can be treated with regular drugs to minimize the
symptoms, including migraine, fever and muscle pain, even though Chiola
said that there was an increased risk of developing hemorrhagic dengue
fever, which in most cases can be fatal. Adding to the state of emergency
that was declared six weeks ago across the country, Chiola said that
authorities are a step away from making it a nationwide measure because of
the rain in the capital and most of the eastern region. Health authorities,
with the help of the armed forces and the national police, increased a
prevention campaign on Tuesday with lectures and house-to-house visits to
educate the public about the danger of puddles, pools and sea weeds on the
beaches. Authorities are trying to inform the public with fliers tossed
from airplanes and helicopters, Chiola said, adding that the puddles and
humidity are creating breeding grounds for the disease's vector, the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito. The minister said that there is a threat of a possible
"epidemic outbreak" that may lead to a "huge tragedy" if one takes into
account that the country's capital, which has about 800 000 residents, is
surrounded by municipalities where they have detected sources of infection.

[I cannot tell from this media report how the diagnoses were made.
Apparently they are seeing only uncomplicated dengue but are concerned
about the possibility of dengue hemorrhagic fever. - Mod.CHC
