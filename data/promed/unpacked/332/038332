WHO: pandemic (H1N1) 2009 briefing note 12 - antiviral use and the
risk of drug resistance
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Growing international experience in the treatment of pandemic (H1N1)
2009 virus infections underscores the importance of early treatment
with the antiviral drugs, oseltamivir or zanamivir. Early treatment
is especially important for patients who are at increased risk of
developing complications, those who present with severe illness, or
those with worsening signs and symptoms.

The experience of clinicians, including those who have treated severe
cases of pandemic influenza, and national authorities suggests that
prompt administration of these drugs following symptom onset reduces
the risk of complications and can also improve clinical outcome in
patients with severe disease. This experience further underscores the
need to protect the effectiveness of these drugs by minimizing the
occurrence and impact of drug resistance.

High-risk situations for development of drug resistance
-------------------------------------------------------
WHO encourages clinicians to be alert to 2 situations that carry a
high risk for the emergence of viruses resistant to oseltamivir. The
risk of resistance is considered higher in patients with severely
compromised or suppressed immune systems who have prolonged illness,
have received oseltamivir treatment (especially for an extended
duration), but still have evidence of persistent viral replication.

The risk of resistance is also considered higher in people who
receive oseltamivir for so-called "post-exposure prophylaxis"
following exposure to another person with influenza, and who then
develop illness despite taking oseltamivir.

In both of these clinical situations, health care staff should
respond with a high level of suspicion that oseltamivir resistance
has developed. Laboratory investigation should be undertaken to
determine whether resistant virus is present and appropriate
infection control measures should be implemented or re-enforced to
prevent spread of the resistant virus.

When a drug-resistant virus is detected, WHO further recommends that
an epidemiological investigation be undertaken to determine whether
onward transmission of the resistant virus has occurred. In addition,
community surveillance for oseltamivir-resistant pandemic H1N1 virus
strains should be enhanced.

In general, WHO does not recommend the use of antiviral drugs for
prophylactic purposes. For people who have had exposure to an
infected person and are at a higher risk of developing severe or
complicated illness, an alternative option is close monitoring for
symptoms, followed by prompt early antiviral treatment should
symptoms develop.

WHO has also recommended against the use of a particular antiviral
where the virus is known or highly likely to be resistant to it. For
this reason, zanamivir is the treatment of choice for patients who
become ill while on oseltamivir prophylaxis.

Oseltamivir-resistant viruses
-----------------------------
Systematic surveillance conducted by the Global Influenza
Surveillance Network, supported by WHO Collaborating Centres and
other laboratories, continues to detect sporadic incidents of H1N1
pandemic viruses that show resistance to oseltamivir. To date, 28
resistant viruses have been detected and characterized worldwide.

All of these viruses show the same H275Y mutation that confers
resistance to the antiviral oseltamivir, but not to the antiviral
zanamivir. Zanamivir remains a treatment option in symptomatic
patients with severe or deteriorating illness due to
oseltamivir-resistant virus.

Of these drug-resistant viruses, 12 were associated with the use of
oseltamivir for post-exposure prophylaxis; 6 were associated with the
use of oseltamivir treatment in patients with severe
immunosuppression; 4 were isolated from samples from patients
receiving oseltamivir treatment.

A further 2 were isolated from patients who were not taking
oseltamivir for either treatment or prophylaxis. Characterization of
the remaining viruses is under way.

These numbers are comparatively small at present. Worldwide, more
than 10 000 clinical specimens (samples and isolates) of the pandemic
H1N1 virus have been tested and found to be sensitive to oseltamivir.

Current conclusions
-------------------
These data support several conclusions. Cases of
oseltamivir-resistant viruses continue to be sporadic and infrequent,
with no evidence that oseltamivir-resistant pandemic H1N1 viruses are
circulating within communities or worldwide.

To date, person-to-person transmission of these oseltamivir resistant
viruses has not been conclusively demonstrated. In some situations,
however, local transmission may have occurred, but without any
further onward or ongoing transmission.

Except for immunocompromised patients, those infected with an
oseltamivir-resistant pandemic H1N1 virus have experienced typical
uncomplicated influenza symptoms. No evidence suggests that
oseltamivir-resistant viruses are causing a different or more severe
form of illness.

The occurrence of oseltamivir-resistant viruses is expected and is
consistent with observations from early clinical trials. As use of
antiviral drugs continues to grow, further reports of drug-resistance
viruses are certain to occur. WHO and its network of collaborating
laboratories are closely monitoring the situation and will issue
information and advice on a regular basis as indicated.
