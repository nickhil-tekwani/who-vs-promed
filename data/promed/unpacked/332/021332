- National. 12 Dec 2019. On [Thu 12 Dec 2019], a health official from the country stated that the government was ready to begin trialing a special bacteria as part of a programme to eradicate the dengue virus. Deputy Director General of the Health Ministry Paba Palihawadana said that a type of bacteria called "Wolbachia" will be released in 25 local townships in Colombo starting February 2020, reports Xinhua news agency.
Wolbachia is a type of bacteria which has been shown to be useful in the fight against dengue. According to the World Mosquito Program, a global not-for-profit organisation, this bacterium reduces the ability of mosquitoes to transmit viruses between people, thereby preventing the occurrence of dengue itself. Other mosquito-borne viruses such as Zika and chikungunya also can be affected thereby wolbachia aids in the transmission of these viruses as well.
The virus works by preventing these viruses from replicating. When the viruses cannot replicate, they cannot be transmitted and the disease is not spent.
Households in Sri Lanka will be provided with mosquito eggs and a food capsule which must be sealed in water for 2 weeks, after which the mature mosquitoes will be released into the environment to spread the bacteria.

Afghanistan
- National. 13 Dec 2019. Between [1 Oct to 4 Dec 2019], 14 out of the 40 samples tested positive for dengue fever by the CPHL (13 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and one by Immunoglobulin M (IgM)). Of the 14 confirmed cases of dengue fever, 7 were presumably autochthonous as the persons had no travel history to dengue endemic countries. One of the seven autochthonous cases died due to hemorrhagic fever. Six other cases had traveled to dengue endemic countries, including 4 people to Pakistan and 2 people to India. One case had an unknown travel history. Out of the 14 cases, 12 (86%) were males, between the age of 21 to 55 years old.
The 14 cases were reported from 6 provinces: Faryab (1 case), Kabul (3 cases), and 4 provinces bordering Pakistan, where a large outbreak of dengue fever is ongoing: Paktita (1 case); Laghman (1 case); Paktya (2 cases); Nangarhar (6 cases).
This is the 2st report of people with autochthonous - meaning locally acquired - cases of dengue fever in Afghanistan. Previous reports of dengue fever involved cases with travel history to dengue-endemic countries.
In 2018, vector surveillance was conducted for the 1st time. The country authorities sent 6 mosquito samples from Khost Province in East Afghanistan to the WHO Collaborating Centre in Singapore for molecular confirmation of Aedes species; 4 of them were identified as _Aedes albopictus_. Additional _Aedes_ mosquito samples from Khost and Nangarhar provinces were collected, which were morphologically identified as _Aedes albopictus_ and _Aedes aegypti_.

[2] Vaccine Efficacy
Date: 12 Nov 2019

https://stke.sciencemag.org/content/12/607/eaav4717.editor-summary
Nearly 50% of the world's population is considered at risk of infection with dengue virus (DENV), a mosquito-borne RNA virus that can potentially cause lethal disease. The efficacy of currently approved vaccines is poor in people who have not previously encountered DENV. Afroz et al. found that pretreatment of mice with the amino acid starvation mimetic halofuginone (HF) increased the adaptive immune response to a DENV vaccine. Known to activate the nutrient-sensing kinase GCN2, HF promoted phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α in immune cells, increased germinal center formation, and increased neutralizing antibody responses. These data demonstrate how activation of this stress-induced kinase improves vaccination. [http://www.sciencemag.org/about/science-licenses-journal-article-reuse]

[3a] Modified Mosquitoes
Date: Thu 21 Nov 2019
Source: IB Times [edited]
https://www.ibtimes.com/scientists-admit-flawed-experiment-may-have-created-super-mosquitoes-2871328


A team of scientists revealed that an experiment that released millions of genetically-modified mosquitoes into the wild to curb the populations of disease-carrying mosquitoes has backfired. A study revealed the genetic traits of the "super mosquitoes" have been passed on to the native species.

Over the course of more than 2 years, British biotech firm Oxitec released 450 000 genetically altered male mosquitoes every week in the city of Jacobina in Brazil. Before they were released, the mosquitoes were transgenically modified to carry a lethal gene designed to reduce the population of the native species.

The experiment was carried out in response to the city's growing issue of mosquito-borne diseases such as yellow fever, Zika, dengue and chikungunya. Oxitec was hoping that the strain carried by its genetically modified mosquitoes would kill off the disease-carrying bugs in the city.

Unfortunately, a study conducted on the results of the experiment revealed that the lethal gene did not work as planned. According to the authors of the study, it did not kill off the offspring of the regular and genetically altered mosquitoes.

"The claim as that genes from the release strain would not get into the general population because offspring would die," Jeffrey Powell, the lead author of the study said in a statement. "That obviously was not what happened."

In addition to not dying, the new generation of mosquitos also displayed genetic traits that are similar to the transgenic mosquitoes. The unfavorable result of the experiment sparked fears that it could create a new breed of mosquitoes with genetic traits that might make them more resistant to current anti-mosquito solutions.

As these new generations of mosquitoes continue to breed, these genetic traits would be passed on in an unending cycle. For the authors of the study, the outcome of the experiment highlights the need to implement monitoring programs in order to identify possible unfavorable results.

[3b] Weather Prediction
Date: 25 Nov 2019

https://www.smh.com.au/national/queensland/how-bali-s-weather-accurately-predicts-dengue-fever-cases-in-australia-20191125-p53dzz.html


Outbreaks of dengue fever in Australia can be predicted with surprising accuracy by measuring rainfall and temperatures in Bali the previous month, new research has found.

The research from the Queensland University of Technology's school of public health and social work has found a strong link between weather patterns causing a rise in dengue cases in Bali and a corresponding jump in cases reported here.

Lead researcher Wenbiao Hu said it was clear Australian tourists were contracting the disease while in the popular holiday destination and bringing it back home.

"Dengue in Bali is significantly associated with imported dengue in Queensland, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Tasmania, Victoria and Western Australia at a lag of one month," Professor Hu said. "This study quantified the relationship between Bali and dengue in Australia, and gives new insight into developing a dengue early warning system in Australia."

Professor Hu said given the conditions in Bali correlated so closely with Australian outbreaks, authorities could theoretically develop a 4-month window to respond to local clusters of the tropical disease.

"The mechanisms behind this lead-time include a few weeks between suitable climate and increased mosquito activity and local dengue transmission in Bali, and the incubation time for infections in Australian travellers, as well as time to diagnosis in Australia," he said.

The disease is found locally in far north Queensland, where it is spread by a species of mosquito called _Aedes aegypti_; however, it had not spread further south because conditions are not right for the mosquitoes.

In particular, the research paper highlights a cluster of dengue cases in the Brisbane area in 2012-2013; however, there was no wider outbreak because _Aedes aegypti_ are not found as far south as Brisbane.

But Professor Wu said as the effects of climate change are felt, there is a strong possibility _Aedes aegypti_ will start to be seen further south, meaning that isolated outbreaks from Bali tourists returning home would become more dangerous.

"At the moment in Brisbane for example, we don't have dengue here, but in the future, we don't know," he said. "If aegypti gets here, then you would see the disease rise in prevalence; at the moment, we have relatively high levels of the disease, but we're lucky that the mosquito isn't here yet. The life cycle of dengue viruses and the growth and survival of dengue mosquitoes is inextricably linked with climate."

It comes after Rockhampton saw an outbreak of dengue fever earlier this year [2019], the 1st confirmed case for nearly 3 decades, prompting a "full outbreak response" from Queensland health authorities.

The research has been published in the journal Environmental Research.

[3c] Ultra-sensitive test for dengue virus
Date: 25 Nov 2019
Source: Medical Net [edited]
https://www.news-medical.net/news/20191125/New-highly-sensitive-test-for-dengue-virus-developed-using-DNA-star.aspx


Researchers from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications alongside those at the Wadsworth Center and Fen Zhou of New York University have developed a new method for detecting and destroying the dengue virus that could be adapted for use on other viruses.

The research, published in Nature Chemistry, details how the technique identifies viruses in the bloodstream and kills them using sections of DNA folded into star shapes using structural DNA nanotechnology. The folded DNA stars are used as traps that capture the virus in the bloodstream, and once in the trap, it causes it to light up.

The results show that the innovation is more sensitive than any alternative test for dengue fever currently on the market, it has been proven to be 100 times for effective at detecting dengue fever than other clinical tests. The test can reliably be used to detect dengue from the 1st day of detection due to the tight binding and high specificity of the process.

The paper also discusses how the technique could theoretically be developed to capture and destroy other viruses, which could have a huge impact on the detection and treatment of a number of illnesses.

The World Health Organization outlines that there is currently no specific treatment for dengue infection and that early detection of the disease is key to lowering fatality rates. This shows that a highly sensitive detection technique with the capability of detecting infection from the 1st day could have a significant impact on reducing fatalities from dengue.

The researchers believe that their innovation could be used against other viruses. They highlight that all viruses work in the same way to infect their host by attaching themselves to the cell wall and injecting in their DNA.

A previous 2016 study showed the effectiveness of a constructed synthetic polymer that was used to trap and destroy the influenza virus before it attached itself to lung cells. However, the synthetic polymer was suspected to be potentially toxic to the human body and, therefore, had little use as a therapeutic device. The DNA star, however, is non-toxic to the body.

The team used structural DNA nanotechnology to fold strands of DNA into intricately designed star-shaped traps that are biodegradable and non-toxic. The shape of the traps was designed specifically to capture dengue, to match the multiple latch points on the virus that exist to catch a cell surface. The DNA star was constructed with specific molecules attached that bind to the viral latches.

The DNA star begins to fluoresce once it is attached to the virus, making it easy to spot in a blood test. Next, the team will work on using a DNA origami nanoplatform to recreate the DNA star shape of aptamers, which will be used to kill the virus once bound to them. The method could be adapted to work with different viruses, designing the DNA stars to address the shape of different viruses specifically.

The research team has developed a successful method that incorporates a novel strategy with emerging technology. They present a technique that surpasses currently available diagnostic tools for dengue, as well as offering a design that can be adapted to target other viruses. The future may see the advancement of this method for use on identifying and treating a number of illnesses, changing the face of virus-based illnesses.
