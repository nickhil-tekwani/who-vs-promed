H5N2 inactivated vaccine effective in preventing bird flu: official
---------------------------------------------------
China used H5N2 inactivated vaccine to prevent spread of H5N1 strain
highly infectious bird flu virus and that has proved to be effective,
an official with the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) said on Tue, 16
Mar 2004.
Jia Youling, MOA spokesman for highly pathogenic avian influenza
(HPAI) control confirmed at a press conference that China reported 49
bird flu cases and killed 9 million poultry in the infected areas
since the first one was confirmed in Dingdang Town, Long'an County of
southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on 27 Jan 2004.
Thanks to compulsory vaccination measures in areas near the infected
areas, the bird flu epidemic had been brought under control in China,
Jia said.
MOA announced Tuesday morning the ending of isolation in the last 2
bird flu-hit areas, in Nanning of Guangxi and Lhasa of southwest
China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
After 5 years of efforts, Chinese scientists had developed a kind of
inactivated vaccine using H5N2 strain virus separated [isolated] from
goose in Foshan, south China's Guangdong Province, which was found
carrying H5N2 strain virus in 1996. They also have made progress in
developing H5N1 fowlpox vaccine.
Jia said both kinds of vaccines were expected to play a key role in
preventing and controlling the spread of bird flu virus in China.
Jia said, lab experiment results showed that 100 percent of poultry
vaccinated with the 2 kinds of vaccines were proved to be strong
enough against bird flu virus.

[This is a very welcome initial information from official Chinese
sources concerning vaccines for the HPAI prevention and control
programs. According to the statement, it seems that at least 2 (new?)
vaccines are currently available:
1. An inactivated vaccine, based upon an H5N2 virus isolated from
("carrier") geese in Foshan, 1996. An H5N2 vaccine, in a country
infected by H5N1 HPAI virus strain, is used as a natural "marker"
vaccine or DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals);
and
2. An (homologous?) H5N1 vaccine, of which no further details are
surrendered (inactivated/ live-attenuated? origin? adjuvants?).
Confirmation of the said data by informed individuals, and further
data on the H5N1 vaccine and on trials carried out with both
vaccines, will be helpful.
Are they meant to replace other vaccines previously in use? - Mod.AS]
