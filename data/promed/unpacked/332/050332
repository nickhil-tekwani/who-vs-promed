During 2004-2005, contact with Salmonella-contaminated pet treats of beef
and seafood origin resulted in 9 culture-confirmed human _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Thompson infections in western Canada and the state of
Washington.
This is the 3rd published report (1,2) of an outbreak of human illness
associated with pet treats in North America and the 1st to describe such an
outbreak in the USA. This report highlights the investigation of the
outbreak by American and Canadian public health officials and provides
recommendations for reducing the risk that salmonella-contaminated pet
treats pose to humans. Public health practitioners should consider pet
treats a potential source for salmonella transmission.
Case Reports:
Case 1. In Feb 2005, a man aged 26 years in Alberta, Canada, sought medical
care because of diarrheal illness. Stool culture yielded _S._ Thompson. The
patient reportedly had fed his dog beef pet treats a few days before the
onset of his illness. The dog was asymptomatic. A package of the same brand
of pet treats fed to the dog was purchased and submitted for testing. The
treats yielded _S._ Thompson, _S._ Cerro, and _S._ Meleagridis. The _S._
Thompson isolates from the patient and the treats were indistinguishable
(i.e., defined as the outbreak strain) by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) using Xba1. The treats were packaged and distributed by a British
Columbia (BC) manufacturing plant, but plant records were inadequate to
determine where the treats had been produced.
Case 2. In Feb 2005, a woman aged 37 years in British Columbia sought
medical care because of diarrheal illness. Stool culture yielded _S._
Thompson. The patient reportedly had fed her dog salmon pet treats a few
days before the onset of her illness. The dog also had a diarrheal illness,
but specimens were not collected. The remaining pet treats were collected
from the patient's house for testing. The treats yielded _S._ Thompson.
Isolates of _S._ Thompson from the patient and treats were indistinguishable
from each other and from the outbreak strain by PFGE. The salmon treats
originated from a Washington manufacturing plant. The treats were imported
into Canada, labeled, and distributed for sale in BC and Alberta by the same
BC manufacturing plant identified in case 1.
Case 3. In Mar 2005, a woman aged 81 years in Washington sought medical care
because of diarrheal illness, fever, and vomiting. The patient was
hospitalized. Stool culture yielded _S._ Thompson indistinguishable from the
outbreak strain by PFGE. The patient had purchased and fed beef pet treats
to her dog before the onset of her illness. The patient reported frequent
contact with her dog but reported no recent illness in the dog. The
remaining treats were collected from the patient's house for testing. The
treats yielded _S._ Thompson indistinguishable from the outbreak strain by
PFGE. The treats originated from and were packaged by the Washington
manufacturing plant that was the source of the treats in case 2.
Additional cases. In 2004 and 2005, 6 additional human cases of _S._
Thompson (3 in BC, 2 in Washington, and 1 in Alberta), with isolates
indistinguishable by PFGE from the outbreak strain, were identified by
PulseNet USA and PulseNet Canada (national molecular subtyping networks for
foodborne disease surveillance). Of the 6 additional patients, 5 were
interviewed; 3 (60 per cent) of them had handled pet treats from the
Washington or BC manufacturing plants. The 2 other patients had pet dogs.
Stool culture from an asymptomatic dog yielded _S._ Thompson
indistinguishable from the outbreak strain by PFGE.
Source investigation
--------------------
The BC and Washington manufacturing plants were investigated by authorities.
Both manufacturers processed frozen, raw beef and salmon into pet treats for
cats and dogs by thawing the materials, cutting them into the desired shapes
and sizes, dehydrating them, and then packaging the finished products for
distribution. The manufacturers in BC and Washington received frozen, raw
beef parts from slaughterhouses in Canada and the United States,
respectively. The Washington manufacturer also received frozen, raw salmon
from a Washington seafood company. Although the pet treats were dehydrated
at the BC and Washington plants, the dehydration temperatures were not high
enough to kill bacteria that might have been present. No processing step,
such as irradiation, that would destroy salmonella and other bacteria was
used during the processing. Production code dates, lot numbers, and location
of plants were not recorded on the finished product packaging. No labels
instructing pet owners to wash their hands after handling the product were
provided. The BC manufacturing plant received some of its processed beef
treats and all of its processed salmon treats from the Washington
manufacturing plant.
Cultures of salmon and beef pet treats manufactured at the Washington plant
and collected at the BC plant by Canadian authorities, and cultures of
salmon treats collected at the Washington plant by American authorities,
yielded _S._ Thompson indistinguishable by PFGE from the outbreak strain.
The salmon treats contained up to 80 000 colony-forming units of salmonella
per gram. Pet treats from the BC and Washington plants also contained other
Salmonella serotypes, including Montevideo, Newport, Give, Meleagridis,
Cerro, Muenster, Agona, and Anatum. Both manufacturing companies issued
voluntary recalls of the implicated products in Jun 2005.

Editorial note:
---------------
In 2004, a total of 5085 laboratory-confirmed cases of human salmonella
infections were reported in Canada, and 35 661 laboratory-confirmed cases
were reported in the USA (3,4). Studies in the USA have demonstrated that
for each laboratory-confirmed case of salmonella infection, 38 infections
occur in the community, indicating that more than 1 million persons in
Canada and the USA might be infected with salmonella each year (5). Although
salmonellosis generally is a self-limiting infection, it can result in
serious illness in more vulnerable populations, such as the very young,
older adults, and immunocompromised persons.
Most human salmonella infections are acquired by handling or consuming
contaminated food products, particularly foods of animal origin. Infections
also are acquired by direct and indirect contact with farm animals,
reptiles, chicks, and, occasionally, pets. Infected animals usually shed
salmonella organisms in their feces. Humans can become infected when they
place contaminated food, hands, or other objects in their mouths; therefore,
hand washing after contact with animals is an effective way to prevent
salmonella infection.
This report describes an outbreak of 9 culture-confirmed cases of human _S._
Thompson infection associated with handling animal-derived pet treats in
Washington and western Canada. Because laboratory-confirmed cases of
salmonella represent only a small proportion of cases in the community (5),
this outbreak might have involved hundreds of infections.
In recent years, an increasing variety of animal by-products, such as pig
ears, have become available for purchase as animal-derived pet treats.
Animal-derived pet treats have been associated with previous outbreaks of
human salmonella infection in Canada. In 1999, contaminated pig ear pet
treats were confirmed as the source of an outbreak of human _S._ Infantis in
several provinces (1,6). In 2002, contaminated pet treats imported from
Texas were associated with human _S._ Newport infections in Calgary, Alberta
(2). The _S._ Infantis isolates from the patients in Canada and from the pet
treats in the USA were indistinguishable by PFGE. Follow-up investigations
of those outbreaks indicated that pet treats are frequently contaminated
with salmonella organisms. In Canada, after the 1999 outbreak, Salmonella
organisms were isolated from 48 (51 per cent) of 94 samples of pig ear pet
treats purchased from retail stores in Alberta (2). In the USA, salmonella
organisms, including _S._Infantis_, were isolated from 65 (41 per cent) of
158 samples of pig ear and other animal-derived pet treats purchased from
retail stores during 1999-2000 (7).
Detecting and controlling the transmission of salmonella organisms through
pet treats poses several challenges (8). Animal-derived pet treats often are
contaminated with salmonellae, and the dehydration procedure used to make
pet treats might not be effective at eliminating the organism. Aside from
direct contact with contaminated pet treats, transmission of salmonellae to
humans might also occur indirectly through infection in pets. Pets consuming
contaminated treats might become colonized with salmonellae but remain
asymptomatic, thus becoming unrecognized sources of contamination in the
household. Young children, older adults, or immunocompromised persons in
such households might have a higher risk for severe illness from salmonella
infection.
In Canada, pet treats are not regulated, but the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency has used the Animal Health Act to encourage product recalls. The
Public Health Agency of Canada and the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council
are collaborating to improve the safety of these products.
In the USA, pet treats are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). Salmonella-contaminated pet treats are considered adulterated under
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FDC) Act. After the 1999 Canadian
outbreak, FDA encouraged manufacturers to take voluntary steps to ensure the
absence of salmonellae in pet treats. In addition, the American Pet Products
Manufacturers Association published Guidelines for the Manufacturing of
Natural Part Treats for Pets to educate its members about contamination
risks (9). In 2004, FDA initiated annual nationwide testing of pet treats
for salmonellae. Because results of this testing have shown that the
prevalence of salmonella organisms in pet treats in the USA has not
decreased, FDA plans to broaden its use of enforcement actions to ensure
compliance with the FDC Act.
Pet treat manufacturers, retailers, health-care providers, public health
authorities, veterinarians, and consumers should be aware of the potential
for animal-derived pet treats to serve as a source of salmonella-related
illness in humans. Public health authorities should routinely consider this
possibility during their investigations of cases or outbreaks of human
salmonellosis. In response to the public health hazard described in this and
other reports, CDC and the Public Health Agency of Canada have issued
recommendations to reduce the risk for transmission of salmonellae to humans
from contaminated animal-derived pet treats.
