More than 400 inhabitants of the municipality of Bajo Baudo (Choco) are apparently affected by a bacterium that is in the water and which has led to the health center of the town being on the highest alert.

The mayor of Bajo Baudo said that the affected persons had vomiting, diarrhea, and high fever and that only the most serious cases are being treated in the health center, while the remaining should remain at home.

The trustee sought the assistance of the national government. The mayor stated that this epidemic cannot be left without attention.

[The etiology of this large cluster of gastroenteritis cases is not stated but could be _Salmonella_, although ProMED earlier in 2014 posted regarding an outbreak in the Choco department that may have been cholera, but it was not clearly documented.

Choco (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choco_Department) is a department of Colombia known for its large Afro-Colombian population. It is in the west of the country and is the only Colombian department to have coastlines on both the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean. It also has all of Colombia's border with Panama. Its capital is Quibdo. - Mod.LL]

[More information on the etiology of this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
