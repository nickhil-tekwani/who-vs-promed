First report of _Haematonectria haematococca_ fruit and stem rot of
_Capsicum annuum_ in New Zealand
----------------------------------------------------------------
Capsicum fruit and stem rots in a New Zealand glasshouse crop were found to
be caused by _Haematonectria haematococca_ [Hh] (Berk. & Broome) Samuels &
Niremburg, comb. nov. (anamorph _Fusarium solani_ (Mart.) Appel & Wollenw.
emend. Snyder & Hansen).
Signs were associated with picking wounds and leaf drop. The signs on stems
were associated with leaf scars and consisted of sunken, watersoaked
lesions, extending away from the node. Whitish aerial mycelium and
cream/yellow spore masses were evident on the surface of stem lesions.
Leaves of infected plants also exhibited features resembling magnesium
deficiency. On fruit, the signs consisted of sunken, circular lesions
increasing in size eventually to cover much of the fruit, with whitish
aerial mycelium, cream/yellow spore masses, and masses of distinctive red
perithecia on the surface.
This is the first report of ... Hh as a pathogen of _Capsicum annuum_ in
New Zealand.

[Hh infects a wide range of crop plants, including pepper. Many physiologic
races are known that are adapted to specific hosts. The fungus is a common
inhabitant in soil. The pathogen is also known to cause disease in sweet
pepper in England, Canada, and the USA. - Mod.DH]
