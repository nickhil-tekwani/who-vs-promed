China found its 2nd case of African swine fever (ASF) on [Thu 16 Aug 2018] at a slaughterhouse owned by WH Group Ltd's Chinese unit, stirring concerns about the spread of the deadly infection across the world's largest pig herd.

Some 30 hogs died of the disease at the slaughterhouse in Zhengzhou in central Henan province, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in a statement. The pigs had traveled thousands of kilometers from a farm in Jiamusi city in China's northeastern province of Heilongjiang, it said.

The outbreak comes almost 2 weeks after another northeastern province, Liaoning, culled thousands of pigs after the discovery of China's 1st case of African swine fever.

The agriculture ministry did not name the company in Heilongjiang, but China's largest pork processor Henan Shuanghui Investment & Development reported earlier on [Thu 16 Aug 2018] that it had discovered a suspected case of the disease, a director of the Heilongjiang Provincial Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Bureau told Reuters. Shuanghui is the Chinese unit of WH Group, the world's top pork producer.

Heilongjiang authorities were investigating whether the pigs were infected in the northeastern province bordering Russia. The provincial veterinary official said it wasn't clear where or how the pigs in Zhengzhou caught the disease.

"We have sent 2 batches of experts from the (Heilongjiang) province and central government to Tangyuan this morning [Thu 16 Aug 2018], where the suspected outbreak was reported," the official said. Tangyuan is a [county] of Jiamusi [prefecture-level city of Jiamusi, province of Heilongjiang].

Shuanghui has diverted orders from its Zhengzhou operations and is cooperating with the authorities to contain the disease, a staff member in the media relations department said.

After the 1st outbreak in Liaoning -- which was also the 1st in East Asia -- Japan suspended imports of heat-treated Chinese pork and has tightened quarantine operations at airports and seaports.

The vast distance the pigs in Henan traveled -- some 2300 km [approx. 1440 mi] southwest from Heilongjiang to central China -- highlights the challenge for the government in controlling the highly contagious disease in the country's vast hog population and beyond its borders.

Henan is China's 2nd-largest pig producer, and is a big supplier to nearby Shandong, Sichuan and Hubei provinces.

"The issue is quite serious now that the disease just hit the center of pig production," said Yao Guiling, an analyst at consultancy China-America Commodity Data Analytics. "The outbreak might be more severe than just the 2 cases that have been confirmed."

Shares in Shuanghui sank 10 percent on [Thu 16 Aug 2018] amid concerns about the impact of the disease on sales. Other large hog farmers, Muyuan Foods Co and Guangdong Wens Foodstuff Group Co, were also sharply lower.

The disease is the latest blow to Chinese hog farmers, who have been struggling with a prolonged rout as years of frenzied investment to boost production have created oversupply, with output well beyond stagnating domestic demand.

ASF is one of the most devastating diseases to affect swine herds. It occurs among pigs and wild boars, transmitted by ticks and direct contact between animals, and its effects are often deadly. There is no vaccine.

The disease does not affect humans.

WH Group was not available for comment.

Shuanghui, headquartered in Luohe, Henan province, has 15 slaughterhouses, with a total annual capacity of 30 million hogs, and 23 production bases across China, spanning from Heilongjiang to the southern province of Guangdong. Shuanghui sells more than 3 million tonnes of pork a year.

On 16 Aug 2018, China submitted to the OIE, an immediate notification on the 2nd outbreak of ASF, located in the province of Henan. According to the epidemiological comments, "Strict blockade, disinfection, and movement control measures were conducted in the slaughterhouse. The local government launched the African swine fever contingency plan and emergency response according to the Standard & Protocol for African swine fever. All live pigs and animal products were prohibited to enter and exit the area. Epidemiological survey and screening have been initiated in the Heilongjiang province". The report is available at <www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=27568>

According to information included in a special announcement by Univ. of Minnesota's Swine Health Information Center (SHIC), dated 16 Aug 2018, ASF's spread in China is even wider and longer. A Chinese media report says that the outbreak started as early as April of this year [2018] (http://www.chinanews.com/sh/2018/08-15/8600530.shtml). A partial translation follows: "The first ASF case was officially confirmed on 3 Aug 2018, on a small farm (owner Zhang) located in the Shenbei District, Shenyang city, Liaoning province. Further investigations indicated that the owner of the ASF index farm purchased 45 pigs on 5 Jul 2018 from a farm (owner Wang) located in the Hunnan District, Shenyang city, Liaoning province. Fecal samples collected from Wang's farm were confirmed ASFV RNA positive by PCR. Wang said that the last entry of pigs onto the farm occurred on 24 Mar 2018. There were 100 piglets purchased from Chuanying District, Jilin city, Jilin province. In April (2018), some pigs started to become sick and then died on the Wang farm. Wang did not report the abnormal pig death; instead the remaining live pigs were sold to the Zhang farm in Shenyang and other people. So far, all of the pigs initially from the Wang farm have been tracked and culled. Wang was held in a detention center due to violation of the laws." The current news on ASF circulation in Heilongjiang, bordering Russia, may be indicative of an initial introduction from Russia, where ASF was reported, in 2017, as far east as Irkutsk (see OIE's interactive ASF outbreaks map at https://tinyurl.com/y93n3df9, click to center on the most eastern foci in Asian Russia, zoom in).

The following text, extracted from UK's DEFRA assessment (8 Aug 2018) of the Chinese event, is applicable:

"China is home to about half of the global pig population, with thousands of backyard and large-scale farms operating in the northern, central and southern regions. It produces about half of the world's pork and China is the largest consumer of pig meat. Smallholding farmers are less likely to have high standards of food safety or strong biosecurity in place to prevent the virus entering the population. A large wild boar population will promote persistence and spread.

"Eurasian wild boar is distributed throughout much of south-east Asia. If the source of infection is the movement of infected wild boar, there is a strong possibility of further spread to Southeast Asia including the Korean Peninsula through wild boar alone". The full assessment is available at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/732324/poa-asf-china.pdf.

The ASF event, involving 3 continents, deserves to be coined a panzootic. - Mod.AS/CRD]
