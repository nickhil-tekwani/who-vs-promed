For any Pacific Island Country or Territory which has a rare bird
collection, it might be prudent to consider a contingency plan for these
collections of birds. Closure of the facility to the public may be wise
during any outbreak or suspected outbreak to minimise the risk of contact
with infected material. Improved biosecurity of the facility to minimise
direct or indirect contact with wild birds would also reduce the chances of
infection. Vaccination may be another strategy worthy of consideration, and
here the vaccine of choice would probably be an oil adjuvant killed H5N2
vaccine, which is currently available commercially and is heterologous to
the current H5N1 strain affecting SE Asia for purposes of DIVA. Different
species of bird are known to respond to this kind of vaccine, but there are
some data from the Netherlands and Singapore on this.

[Thanks much to Steve Angus for sharing his recommendations to the Pacific
Community veterinarians. Some parts of the Pacific Community may
unknowingly imported poultry from avian influenza-infected areas of Asia,
and others may find themselves in the migratory bird pathways, so the
cautions from Steve Angus are well-placed.
The Pacific Community is 22 islands and territories ranging from the
Northern Marianas to Pitcairn Island, with a population of about 7 million.
Some places are rapidly increasing in population and others are decreasing.
The members of the Pacific Community are spread over 30 million square
kilometres, more than 98 per cent of which consists of ocean; the Pacific
region is vast. Of its 7500 islands, only about 500 are inhabited. The
islands themselves feature great geographical diversity. Papua New Guinea
accounts for 83 per cent of the land area, while Nauru, Pitcairn, Tokelau,
and Tuvalu are each smaller than 30 square kilometres. To learn more, see
