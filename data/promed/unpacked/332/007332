A vet has warned North-east [Scotland] rabbit owners to urgently vaccinate their pets against a fatal disease, after a rapid outbreak.

Donview Veterinary Centre said myxomatosis is "spreading fast" in the Inverurie area.

Vets have seen around 8 pets with the disease in the past week alone.

Charlie Carnochan, director of the centre, said he hadn't seen a single case for a couple of years, until now.

He added: "We used to see it constantly but it hasn't happened for a while. Every day we're getting rabbits in with myxy. It's just horrible. We can't treat it, it's pretty much fatal.

"It's quite scary the speed it's coming on and we have cut our vaccination costs down. The vaccine has to be done quickly because it takes some time for the vaccine to work." Less than 5 per cent of rabbits in the Inverurie area are vaccinated against the disease.

Myxomatosis is caused by the myxoma virus, which is widely distributed in the wild rabbit population.

Even if a rabbit never comes into direct contact with animals from the wild, it can still become infected with this disease.

This is because the virus is spread by bites from mosquitoes, flies, fur mites and fleas. The 1st symptoms are puffy eyelids and pus coming from the eye.

The disease leads to swelling of the throat, trouble breathing, bacterial infections and dehydration.

A vaccine, which lasts for a year, prevents most rabbits from contracting the disease although some may contract a mild but treatable form.

[Myxomatosis is an OIE-reportable disease of Lagomorpha ("hare-shaped" in ancient Greek). The following information about this viral disease is derived from chapter 2.6.1, OIE's Terrestrial Manual, updated 2014 (http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.01_MYXO.pdf):

"Myxomatosis is essentially a disease of European rabbits. Brown hares (_Lepus europaeus_) are susceptible to MYXV infection, but rarely develop generalized disease. _Sylvilagus_ spp. are quite resistant and may act as healthy carriers. There is no health risk to humans. Two forms of the disease are observed in rabbits: the nodular (classical) form, characterised by gross myxomatous skin lesions, and the amyxomatous (respiratory) form, in which signs are mainly respiratory, skin nodules being few and small.

The nodular form is caused by virulent MYXV strains, is naturally transmitted by biting insects, especially during summer time, and is mainly observed in wild and pet rabbits and in small-scale rabbitries. During MYXV infection the copious viral immunomodulatory proteins progressively induce the collapse of the host immune system. This favours bacterial infections in the respiratory tract that greatly contribute to the death of the animal.

MYXV strains with different degrees of pathogenicity have arisen since the introduction of MYXV into rabbit populations and these circulate in the field. Mild and attenuated strains cause the amyxomatous (respiratory) form of the disease especially in farmed animals. Wild rabbits act as reservoirs while mosquitoes and fleas can transmit the virus to domestic rabbits, but in the case of close proximity between rabbits (i.e. in farmed animals), virus may also be transmitted by direct contact. Introduced semen may also pose a risk. There is no age or sex predilection."

The disease, which is not reportable in the UK, has been reported as present in each of the annual reports of the last years.

Inverurie is situated in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. - Mod.AS
