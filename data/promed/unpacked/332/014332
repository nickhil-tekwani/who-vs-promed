[1] USA (Coconino country, Arizona)
Date: Wed 10 Jul 2013

Authorities say a 2nd Coconino County resident has been diagnosed with hantavirus, but the woman is recovering.

Health officials said Wednesday [10 Jul 2013] that the woman lives in the county's southwestern area but didn't release her name, age, or city where she resides.

County Public Health Services District officials say they're investigating where the woman contracted [a] hantavirus, which is spread by infected rodent droppings.

Authorities say a Flagstaff [Coconino County] woman died last month [June 2013] from complications of hantavirus. Her name wasn't released.

[Sin Nombre] hantavirus is transmitted to people that come into contact with or breathe infected urine, droppings, and/or saliva of wild mice, primarily deer mice [_Peromyscus maniculatus_]. The virus isn't spread from person to person.

Health officials say there have now been 23 confirmed hantavirus cases in Arizona since 2006 and 11 of those victims died.

[The hantavirus responsible for these 2 cases is most likely Sin Nombre virus. Its rodent host is _Peromyscus maniculatus_ (deer mouse), which is widely distributed in North America and frequently invades houses. The fatal case mentioned above is the same one reported by ProMED-mail on 10 Jun 2013 (archive no 20130610.1764015). The case fatality rate for Sin Nombre virus infection is 38-40 per cent, with a higher risk of death in those patients who only seek medical attention late in the course of their disease.

"On Thursday [4 Jul 2013] a 20 year old woman was hospitalized with a serious, deteriorating condition, with fever and respiratory difficulty that required immediate resuscitation procedures," stated the Director of the Center, Guillermo Van Kemenade.

In conversation with Ramallo Ciudad Information Services, he explained that "A series of X-rays and platelet counts were carried out in order to determine the cause of the clinical picture. [Her] clinical situation worsened, causing respiratory arrest for which she had to be assisted, but she died at 19:15 hrs.

"Her clinical situation presented as one of deterioration, respiratory distress, and multi-organ failure, with altered renal function and blood clotting. This clinical picture could be suspicious of [a] hantavirus [infection]," the physician speculated.

The health professional indicated that samples were taken from the dead patient and sent to investigate if, definitively, this was a case of [a] hantavirus [infection].

[Cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2012), and again this year (2013), including Buenos Aires province. The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_). ProMED would be interested in receiving information about the specific virus involved when laboratory tests have been completed.

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems very unlikely in this case. This case may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.

An image of the yellow pygmy rice rat, _O. flavescens_, is available at http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_WrdzfKHDxmQ/SJ-E642S6MI/AAAAAAAABz4/DaDCHaFSDDE/s400/rato+dagua.jpg.
