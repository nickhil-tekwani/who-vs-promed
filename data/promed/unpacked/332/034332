Kharkiv introduces quarantine due to rabies cases
-------------------------------------------------
Due to cases of rabies among animals, 2 districts of Kharkiv have
introduced quarantine restrictions. The decision was made at a meeting
of the city emergency commission. According to Gennady Pishchanski,
the Veterinary Inspector of Kharkiv, 2 cases of bites by rabid cats
were registered on Tue 25 Oct 2011. The condition of the victims is
stable, no signs of the disease. The quarantine will last 2 months.

According to the data of the city council, 56 cases of rabies among
animals have been registered in the Kharkiv region since the beginning
of the year.

[This incident is the 4th [recent] case of rabies among cats in
Kharkiv (see, Rabies - Ukraine (02): (KV) feline, human exposure 20110306.0744). Clearly there has been no improvement in the situation
and it is not clear what measures, other than quarantine, have been
taken to combat feline rabies. No human fatalities have been reported.
It must be presumed that adequate post-exposure treatment is available
in Karkiv, but this is not stated. Clarification would be welcomed.
