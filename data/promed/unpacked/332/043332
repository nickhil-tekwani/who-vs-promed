Horses receive initial Hendra all-clear
---------------------------------------
Seven horses under quarantine in Brisbane have returned negative
results for Hendra virus, although more testing is needed.

Queensland's chief veterinary office Dr Rick Symons said a 1st round
of testing at Park Ridge had returned promising results after a horse
from the property died of the lethal bat-borne disease.

Nationwide, 7 horses with Hendra have died or been put down since 20
Jun 2011 -- 5 in southern Queensland and 2 in northern NSW and 10
properties (8 in QLD, 2 in NSW) are under quarantine.

Horses across all affected properties are being tested.

Dr Symons said the horses would be tested twice more over the coming
month while horses at Beaudesert, possibly exposed when 1 died there
last month [June 2011], will undergo their 2nd round of tests this
week [week of 11 Jul 2011].

Meanwhile, another property at Park Ridge is no longer under
quarantine after it was assessed to be at low risk.

"This means the number of properties quarantined as a result of the
Hendra virus in Queensland is down from 9 to 8 and the number of
horses being monitored and tested is 40," Dr Symons said in a
statement.

A total of 32 people (17 in QLD, 15 in NSW) are believed to have been
exposed to Hendra-infected horses and all now face 3 rounds of tests
before they will get the all-clear.

Dr Symons said the virus was not highly contagious and there was no
restriction on horse movement in Queensland apart from the 8
quarantined properties. But he asked horse owners to adopt good
biosecurity practices and not transport sick ones. "It is better to
leave the horse at home, segregate it, and call your veterinarian," he
said.

[This is a bit of good news in this horrible situation of Hendra
virus. This is also a nice summary of properties, horses, and people
being affected by testing and quarantines. Of course, those families
who are anxiously waiting for their loved ones to be cleared are not
counted here and are likely still tense about the situation. - Mod.TG]
