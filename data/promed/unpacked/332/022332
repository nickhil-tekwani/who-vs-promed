About 84 000 birds in Ontario have died or been destroyed since a new strain of bird flu was detected in the province last month.

Craig Price, who is heading up the federal government's response to the discovery of the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of bird flu, said at a media briefing Monday [11 Apr 2022] that outbreaks have been confirmed at 11 properties in Ontario. The latest case, detected Sunday [10 Apr 2022], was found in the Township of Glengarry just west of the Quebec border.

Price wouldn't say how many birds have been destroyed in the 2 outbreaks closest to London -- in Chatham-Kent and western Oxford County -- to protect the identities of the producers involved.

In 2015, federal and provincial officials spent months containing and eventually eradicating a strain of bird flu. That outbreak was contained to 3 farms in Oxford County. About 80 000 birds, mostly turkeys, were wiped out.

Ontario is the largest producer of poultry in the country, with much of the industry in southwestern Ontario.

Price, the incident commander for the national emergency operations centre on avian influenza at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, said more than 260 000 birds have died or been destroyed across the country. Outbreaks have been confirmed in Alberta, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador as well as Ontario.

The agency says bird flu is spreading in wild bird populations around the world and is a "significant national concern" as birds migrate to Canada.

The 1st confirmed case in a wild bird in the province was a red-tailed hawk found in the Region of Waterloo on 21 Mar [2022], Chris Sharp, a federal-government biologist, said at the same briefing. The hawk was showing neurological signs, and it was euthanized, Sharp said.

The 1st outbreak in Ontario poultry was confirmed by officials on 27 Mar [2022] in the Township of Guelph-Eramosa in a turkey flock.

Price did not specify where in Chatham-Kent the 10th outbreak was detected. "We have not seen or observed evidence of farm-to-farm movement of the disease" in any of the outbreaks in Canada, Price said. Such transmission is possible, but the current outbreaks are "most likely an introduction through wild birds."

This is the 1st time the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of bird flu has been found in Canada, said Mary Jane Ireland, the executive director of the animal health directorate, policy and programs branch at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Canada's chief veterinary officer, who also was at the briefing.

"I think this is, in recent memory, one of the larger number of cases in multiple provinces of avian influenza and the 1st time we have had H5N1," she said.

Ontario's Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs says bird flu is not a threat to food safety when properly handled and cooked.

It also says avian influenza is not a significant public health concern for healthy people who are not in regular contact with infected birds.

https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/more-than-160000-farm-birds-dead-destroyed-in-alberta-due-to-avian-flu-feds


[Counties involved in this report include Wetaskiwin, Ponoka, Paintearth, Kneehill, and Mountain View. - Mod.TG]

Alberta poultry producers are bearing the brunt of the Canadian spread of avian influenza with at least 166 000 farm birds dead or culled in what federal officials are calling an unprecedented event.

It's the hardest-hit province in terms of poultry bird destruction, amounting to about 64% of the more than 260 000 production birds lost in Canada to the highly contagious virus spread by wild, mainly aquatic birds.

As of Sunday [10 Apr 2022] night, the disease had been detected at 6 farms in Alberta -- located in Wetaskiwin, Ponoka, Paintearth, Kneehill, and Mountain View Counties -- and led to them being placed under quarantine, the latter 2 jurisdictions not far from Calgary to the city's north and northeast.

"This is an unprecedented year for the spread of avian influenza globally ... It's spread rapidly since being detected last year [2021]," said Mary Jane Ireland, Canada's chief veterinary officer. "We anticipate we will have other finds (of outbreaks)."

The disease was first detected in Canada last December [2021] in Newfoundland and Labrador and has since spread to Nova Scotia, Ontario, Alberta, and possibly Quebec.

The higher presence of avian influenza, said Ireland, is due to a heightened "environmental pressure on migratory birds right now."

It's important producers disregard any notion the threat is exaggerated -- much as what's happened with the COVID-19 pandemic -- and take rigorous precautions, said Ireland. "We're asking producers, small flock owners, and large producers to strengthen their biosecurity measures," she said. "I understand how hard this is for poultry producers and small flock owners ... It's a very disruptive and stressful situation."

The bird flu is a worry every year at this time, but this is the 1st spring the virus has been found in Alberta, said Jeff Notenbomer, a Fort Macleod-area broiler breeder and chairman of Alberta Hatching Egg Producers.

"It's a little stressful right now," said Notenbomer, whose operation ultimately produces about 6 million kg [6614 US tons] of chicken meat a year. "When a broiler farm goes down, it can have a significant ripple effect through the industry."

At Park Lane Farms just east of Calgary, numerous measures are being taken to keep the flock of 5000 meat chickens free of the influenza, said owner Jerry Kamphuis. "Nobody's allowed onto the farm. The manager is the only one who tends to the birds, and we've got all sorts of protocols including boot baths," he said. "Of course, it's a great concern because it would devastate my business."

Those concerns are especially acute now with the spring return of migratory birds, said Kamphuis, adding that a federally imposed control zone limiting the movement of animals, equipment, and products has expanded to his farm.

At her farm west of Okotoks where she raises specialty chickens and turkeys, Beth Laing said she's always taken biosecurity measures seriously, but worries there's only so much she can do. "You can do everything you can, but if someone a kilometre down the road is infected, they could cull my flock too," said Laing, of KB Ranch Heritage Breed Poultry. "If (an infected) flock flies over and poops on your place, you might not be able to do much to stop that flu. The scary part is the uncertainty."

Federal officials say it doesn't appear the influenza is spread from one farm to another, but it's been known to transmit to humans, who aren't significantly affected by it if they're healthy and don't spend considerable time around birds.

It's unclear what impact the virus might have on consumers, who have already seen food prices -- including the cost of poultry -- rise sharply in the past year, as the inflation rate has hit 30-year highs, said Donald Boucher, a director of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

"We're not in the position to make a linkage (to food prices), but definitely there are adjustments being made by the industry to ensure the supply chain," said Boucher. "Prices are top of mind for Canadians, so definitely we're monitoring the situation."

Poultry producers are being told to watch closely for signs of avian influenza in their flocks, which include reduced egg production, swelling around birds' eyes and necks, sneezing, dead animals, diarrhea, and lack of energy, movement, or coordination.

"Operators should reduce poultry feed exposure that might attract wild birds, avoid introducing new birds, keep their farms clean, and minimize visitors," said Ireland. "People can spread the disease from clothing or shoes, and tires and wheel wells can also be cleaned," she said.

Ottawa offers compensation to farms undergoing culling, noted broiler breeder Notenbomer, "but farmers are very worried it's not sufficient."

The 1st case of bird flu in a Kansas commercial operation has been confirmed in a turkey flock in McPherson, state and federal agriculture officials announced Monday [11 Apr 2022]. Previously, avian influenza had been confirmed only in 4 backyard flocks in Kansas.

The Kansas Department of Agriculture and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service is working with the McPherson firm, according to a statement from the state agriculture department. The affected premises is under quarantine, and the birds will be culled to prevent spread of the disease. Any farms or properties with poultry within 12.43 miles (20 kilometers) of the McPherson firm will not be allowed to move birds or poultry products on or off their property without permission from state agriculture department.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the bird flu does not present a danger to public health.

Two more cases of bird flu have been confirmed in Wisconsin. They're the 3rd and 4th confirmed outbreaks in the state. On Friday [8 Apr 2022], the state Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection (DATCP) confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza at a non-commercial farm with about 200 turkeys and ducks south of Milwaukee.

Those birds have already been "depopulated," according to DATCP.

On Saturday [9 Apr 2022], the agency identified HPAI in a commercial poultry flock in Barron County. Those birds will also be depopulated.

Last week, DATCP issued an order suspending poultry shows and exhibits through the end of May [2022] in an effort so slow spread of the disease.

Owners are asked to continue using strong biosecurity practices and, when possible, move flocks indoors to limit exposure to wild birds.

[5] Colorado (Pitkin County): backyard chickens

US Department of Agriculture inspectors confirmed the 1st case of avian flu in a backyard chicken flock in Colorado on Saturday [9 Apr 2022].

The highly pathogenic avian influenza, known as HPAI, was detected in a non-commercial flock in Pitkin County, according to the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The infected chickens will be killed, and all affected premises are being quarantined, the USDA said.

Officials are asking anyone from those with backyard chickens to commercial poultry farms to review biosecurity measures to avoid the further spread of the highly contagious disease.

State officials had confirmed the presence of avian flu in wild birds in parts of Colorado late last month [March 2022], leading the Denver Zoo to shut down its outdoor bird exhibits and bring the animals inside.

Wild birds typically do not die from the avian flu, but it can be deadly to poultry and other species. It's most common in waterfowl, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports the risk to humans is low.

But it's much more dire for poultry. Olga Robak, director of communications for the Colorado Department of Agriculture, previously told the Denver Post that it's 90% to 100% fatal in poultry. Prior to the current outbreak, the avian flu hadn't been confirmed in the US since 2015, though there were no cases in Colorado during that time.

Previously, the Colorado Department of Agriculture reported that, since late last month [March 2022], cases of the avian flu have been confirmed in wild birds in Sedgwick, Morgan, and Denver counties.

Nearly 23 million chickens and turkeys have already been killed across the United States to limit the spread of the virus. The highly pathogenic avian influenza is most common in ducks, geese, and swans, spreading to other birds through mucus, saliva, and feces. Experts say it can be spread through contaminated equipment, clothing, boots, and vehicles carrying supplies.

Robak said the Department of Agriculture is working with poultry farmers to establish plans to proactively prevent the spread of disease and has enacted a 90-day pause on any bird co-mingling events.

https://www.postbulletin.com/news/minnesota/7-new-infection-sites-as-minnesota-reaches-1-37m-birds-impacted-by-avian-flu


An additional 7 poultry flocks diagnosed with avian flu were reported Monday [11 Apr 2022], including the 5th commercial turkey flock in Kandiyohi County and the 1st sites in Renville and Swift counties.

The flock of 145 000 commercial meat turkeys in Swift County is among the largest flocks to date diagnosed with H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza, according to the state Board of Animal Health's daily web update.

Renville County's 1st reported infection site is 76 381 commercial meat turkeys.

The additional flock in Kandiyohi County is 21 250 commercial turkey breeder hens. The previous 4 reports in Kandiyohi County have been from 2 breeder hen flocks and 2 meat turkey flocks.

Stearns County now has 5 infection sites with an additional flock of commercial meat turkeys numbering 26 293. One report there has been from a backyard producer, and the rest are all meat flocks.

Other new infection sites reported Monday [11 Apr 2022] were a flock of 20 438 in Waseca County, 30 000 birds in Otter Tail County, and 38 000 in LeSueur County, all of them commercial meat turkeys.

According to the state Board of Animal Health, the inventory of flocks diagnosed with avian influenza is now at 1 373 664 encompassing 28 infection sites. The new reports posted Monday [11 Apr 2022] included diagnoses confirmed 7-9 Apr [2022].

The 1st Minnesota cases of the disease -- which is fatal to domestic poultry -- were confirmed 25 Mar [2022], according to the Board of Animal Health.

One previous report has been reclassified by the Board of Animal Health. The 1st infection site in Waseca County confirmed 5 Apr [2022] was originally listed as a slaughter location, but its production type has since been changed to commercial meat turkeys.

According to information from the Board of Animal Health, responders enter the data with what is known when the case arises, and quality control staff routinely review the data later for consistency and may make changes to give a more accurate description of the premises.

There have been 2 reports from backyard poultry producers, 3 from commercial turkey breeder hen flocks in Kandiyohi County, and the rest of the 28 sites have been meat turkeys.

Other affected counties include Becker, Big Stone, Dodge, Lac qui Parle, Meeker, Morrison, and Mower.

The Board of Animal Health web page on the avian flu response at http://www.bah.state.mn.us/hpai is updated each weekday.

[Overwhelming is the only way to describe seeing your flock being destroyed by disease, and entire barns of poultry having to be euthanized. Your investment, your time, your energy, and your passion for what you do leaves one feeling empty and devastated. This virus respects no one but brings destruction for many. As sad as it for the producers, it is also alarming for consumers as prices go up and product shortages occur.

Take every precaution possible. Limit how many people are on the production site, and exercise extreme biosecurity. If you are a small operator, bring your birds inside and do not be around any other birds.

Biosecurity is a way of life, not a word on a page. It is part of the safety of your birds and perhaps even of your own well-being. - Mod.TG
