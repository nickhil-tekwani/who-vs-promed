Parents have been urged to give their children the MMR [measles,
mumps, rubella] vaccine as it was revealed Britain is in the middle
of the worst measles outbreak for 20 years. The unprecedented
warning from the Health Protection Agency [HPA] came as the number of
children suffering from the disease trebled over the last 11
weeks. Experts fear even more will be infected as the autumn school
term begins.
This is the worst outbreak since the controversial MMR vaccine was
introduced in 1988. Take-up of the triple jab -- which also protects
against mumps and rubella -- plummeted to 80 per cent after Dr Andrew
Wakefield claimed it was linked to autism and bowel
problems. Leading scientists have since debunked Dr Wakefield's
claims and rates of uptake are creeping back to recommended levels --
except in London, where a quarter of children are still not vaccinated.
Experts say the scare is directly responsible for the recent surge in
measles cases. Up until [10 Jun 2007], 136 [cases] had been
confirmed by the HPA. But as of [24 Aug 2007] -- just over 11 weeks
later -- this had more than trebled to 480. The increase in
infection rates has led the Health Protection Agency to issue a
nationwide vaccination plea for the 1st time. Doctors have urged
parents to make sure children receive the jab before returning to school.
Dr Mary Ramsay, a consultant epidemiologist at the Agency, said:
"Over the summer holidays we have seen more cases of measles being
reported than we would normally expect. This means it is crucial that
children are fully immunised with 2 doses of MMR before they return
to school. "Measles is a highly infectious and dangerous illness and
as there is increased close contact in schools, it can spread easily.
Now is the time parents will be buying their children a new school
uniform to prepare for the school year ahead, but being prepared to
avoid infection is even more important. "Parents should think about
adding the MMR vaccine to their back to school 'to do' list."
The combined vaccine consists of 2 jabs -- one given at 13 months and
a "booster" between the ages of 3 and 5 [years]. Both injections are
necessary as up to 10 per cent of children are still not protected
against measles after the 1st one.
In 1998, Dr Wakefield published research in the Lancet linking the
MMR jab to autism. His claims caused a furor, with some parents
paying privately for their children to have single vaccines instead
of the combined jab. Others decided not to have their children
vaccinated at all. Prime Minister Tony Blair refused to say whether
he had given his son Leo the combined jab.
Since the scare, take-up of the jab has gradually recovered and now
88 per cent of parents are having their children vaccinated. This is
still well below the recommended level of 95 per cent. Another
concern is that the take-up of the booster is much lower than that of
the 1st jab, at only 74 per cent. The Health Protection Agency is
worried that parents are simply forgetting about it.
Dr Ramsay added: "Public confidence in MMR vaccine continues to
remain high. However, it is also important to remember that children
should complete their full course."
The rise in the number of measles cases over the summer has been
particularly pronounced in areas where vaccination rates are
traditionally low, such as traveller sites. Last year a 13-year-old
boy, from a travelling community in the North-West, became the 1st
person to die of measles since 1992. But many of the cases are among
unvaccinated schoolchildren. There have also been a number of small
outbreaks among holidaymakers returning from abroad.
Dr Mike Fitzpatrick, a GP in Hackney, east London, said 10 children
with measles were hospitalised in his borough since May [2007]. "We
are seeing the biggest outbreak for 20 years and there is no doubt it
is [due] to the low uptake of MMR," he said. "The only surprise is
that it hasn't happened earlier. The worry now is that with the
return to school this will really take off." He added, "There have
been a few outbreaks in Europe recently and what they show is that if
you get up to 1000 or 2000 cases you're going to get one or 2 deaths.
That must be the fear with this outbreak. It also raises the fear
that we will return to outbreaks happening every year -- something
that hasn't happened for 20 years."
Measles is most common among children under 4 [years], but can strike
in older children and adults too. It can have potentially fatal
complications including pneumonia, hepatitis, and swelling of the
brain. The disease is so dangerous because sufferers are infectious
for 3 days before their symptoms become apparent.
Anti-MMR campaigners said yesterday [30 Aug 2007] that the current
surge in cases would not have happened if a single measles jab was
available on the NHS [National Health Service]. Jackie Fletcher, of
campaign group Jabs, said, "Health ministers should be asking
themselves why so many parents are still rejecting the MMR vaccine.
If the Department of Health really has the best interests of children
at heart they should reinstate the single vaccine at every NHS
surgery across the UK."

[According to the most recent data available on the HPA website
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/infections/topics_az/measles/data_mmr_confirmed.htm>),
there were 736 cases of measles reported in the UK during 2006, the
highest number of reported cases since 1996 (see table below for
annual reported cases of measles in the UK).
If the newswire above is correct, there are reports of 480 cases of
measles during the period January through 24 August 2007 and concerns
that this year's total reported cases will surpass that seen in 2006.
The impact of decreasing coverages with measles-containing vaccines
due to high publicity on the part of the anti-vaccine lobby have now
been clearly seen in the UK where significant transmission of the
measles virus is occurring. One can only hope that the present
publicity surrounding the upsurge in measles cases will help
counteract the anti-vaccine lobbies and result in increased uptake of
the vaccine.
