Serious case of encephalitis confirmed in Taiwan
------------------------------------------------
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [Taiwan] under the Department
of Health [Taiwan] yesterday [26 Apr 2011] confirmed the 1st case of
encephalitis caused by Acanthamoeba spp in Taiwan.

The patient is a 63-year-old male in central Taiwan. The previously
healthy farmer fell into a ditch during farm work in a rice field in
December 2008, said a CDC researcher, yesterday during a press
conference. He later displayed symptoms such as a high fever, severe
headaches and abdominal distention 10 days after the accident. He was
then sent to a hospital in central Taiwan's Changhwa County for
treatment.

His cerebrospinal fluid test revealed a high number of white blood
cells which could indicate a parasite infection. A further test showed
that the farmer was infected by _Acanthamoeba_ spp, which are
free-living amoebae that inhabit a variety of air [sic], soil, and
water environments.

Ditch water specimens also found identical _Acanthamoeba_ spp. The
patient was later transferred to National Taiwan University Hospital
in Taipei for further treatment after being diagnosed with the rare
disease. It took him 78 days before his full recovery. However, the
patient has developed some side effects since his recovery, such as
speech problems.

The mortality rate associated with _Acanthamoeba_ infection is very
high, at around 80 to 90 percent. It is therefore rare that a local
hospital was able to help the patient to recover, according to the
CDC. The case has been published in international medical journals.
CDC Deputy Director-General Chou Jih-haw reminded the public not to
bathe in dirty water if one has a wound or cut in the skin, to avoid
infection.

[Free-living amoebae are probably ubiquitous in most parts of the
world, and lack of reports most probably reflects that the infection
is rare and diagnostics are only available in a few laboratories. The
reports state that a "high number of white blood cells which could
indicate a parasite infection." These are eosinophils, so called
because they stain red with diagnostic dyes, and appear during worm
infections; but protozoan parasites like _Acanthamoeba_ do not induce
an eosinophilic response.
