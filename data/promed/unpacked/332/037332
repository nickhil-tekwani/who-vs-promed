A new case of sleeping sickness imported from Tanzania (Serengeti)
------------------------------------------
We would like to report another European case of acute Rhodesian
trypanosomiasis from the Serengeti, NW Tanzania. A young man of 32 years
was hospitalized on 12 Oct 2001 in the Tropical Diseases ward, University
Hospital of Antwerp, following a history of high-grade fever for 4 days,
appearing 14 days after being exposed to multiple tsetse fly bites in the
area surrounding Sopa Lodge, southwestern Serengeti. The game drive where
the bites were contracted happened a wooded area (acacia trees) in the
vicinity of the lodge.
An inoculation chancre was present 7 days later, but not correctly
diagnosed at that moment. Clinical presentation at hospitalisation included
high-grade fever, headache, prostration, jaundice, "trypanids," and a
sequellar lesion of the chancre. There was moderate splenomegaly, signs of
hepatitis and thrombocytopenia, but no ECG abnormalities. Thick film showed
abundant _Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense_ parasites. As expected CSF
examination was normal. Patient became afebrile 2 days after administration
of Suramin 1g. He was discharged on day 4, with liver function tests
normalized and thombocytopenia compensated. He is scheduled for weekly
Suramin injections for the next 5 weeks.
This case illustrates that we have to remain vigilant towards East African
trypanosomiasis in travelers to the Serengeti (and Tarangire), Tanzania.

[This case adds weight to the comment made in a ProMED-mail posting a week
ago, in which the International Scientific Council for Trypanosomiasis
Research and Control warned of the large epidemic in Central Africa.
Travellers should be warned about infection risk in the game parks in
Tanzania and Serengeti in particular. Febrile travellers with no other
obvious reason for the fever should be investigated for sleeping sickness.
