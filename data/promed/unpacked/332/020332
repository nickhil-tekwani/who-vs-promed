Cholera Spreads to Tete
-----------------------
The Mozambican cholera epidemic has now spread to the western
province of Tete, reports Friday's 12 Mar 2004 issue of the Maputo
daily "Noticias". The Tete Cholera Treatment Center (CTC) has
diagnosed the first 4 cases of the disease, but no deaths have been
reported.The local health authorities believe that this onset of the
disease is linked to the persistent rainfall in the region.

The cholera epidemic began in December 2003 , and is known to have
claimed 76 lives. It has struck Maputo city and province, Gaza, and
Inhambane, in the south, Sofala and Zambezia in the central region,
Nampula in the north, has now Tete in the west. The largest number of
patients have been treated in Maputo city (8742), followed by Sofala
(2851). About half of these cases have been in Beira.

Zambezia has notified 514 cases with 4 deaths, Nampula had 507 with 4
deaths, followed by Gaza, with 337 cases and 5 deaths, and lastly
Inhambane, with 14 cases and no deaths reported. The last case here
was diagnosed about 3 weeks ago.

The average lethality rate in the country is estimated at 0.6 percent.

The health authorities speak of a downward trend of the disease, and
are hopeful that they can keep it under control, although the rainy
season is expected to last until April 2004.

93 Cases of Cholera in Rumonge
------------------------------
Rumonge District, in Burundi's southern province of Bururi, has
registered 93 cases of cholera resulting in 4 deaths since January
2004, health services have reported.

The director of Rumonge hospital, Dr Innocent Ntamavukiro, told IRIN
on Wednesday that 18 people were hospitalised at his facility. The
majority of patients are from Kizuka subcounty, about 10 km from
Rumonge center. Other affected areas include Kanyenkoko and Iteba, 2
suburbs of Rumonge urban center, with a majority of Muslim residents.

The epidemic broke out on 11 Jan 2004 in Kanyenkoko and Iteba. Health
authorities thought the situation had been brought under control by
the end of the month, with 38 cases recorded. However, 5 new cases
were registered in early February 2004 in Kizuka.

While medicines are available free of charge, Rumonge administrator
Emile Hicintuka said patients often failed to seek timely medical
care. "3 of the 4 people died at home. People believe in witchcraft
and prefer to consult traditional healers," he said.

In a meeting with local administration officials, Hicintuka urged
them to sensitise Rumonge residents about hygiene and sanitation, and
the importance of seeking medical treatment as soon as possible.
However, Ntamavukiro said his hospital lacked sufficient serologic
solutions to cope with the situation.

"We have to renew the stock regularly from Bujumbura, but we need a
permanent stock here, especially now that the health centre of Kizuka
does not help much," he said.

Cholera epidemics occur almost every year in Rumonge, possibly due to
an acute shortage of clean water and overpopulation in many suburbs
of Rumonge center, Ntamavukiro said. Many low-income people in
Rumonge use polluted water from Lake Tanganyika for all their needs,
including drinking.

Cholera has broken out at the Chainama Hills Hospital, where a
patient with psychiatric illness has died.

Central Board of Health (CBoH) spokesperson Victor Mukonka, who
confirmed the matter, said 5 patients were quarantined last week, but
3 of them have since been discharged. Dr Mukonka added that only one
cholera patient at the institution was still under treatment, adding
that the condition of the patient was stable.

"Last week cholera broke out at Chainama hospital. A patient with
psychiatric illness has since died. The situation was brought under
control following deployment of health personnel at the institution,"
he said.

Meanwhile, Dr Mukonka has said the cholera cases in the country have
reduced. He however noted that cholera was still a problem in Lusaka
at the moment. Dr Mukonka also said that some of the schools which
were closed during February 2004 due to poor sanitation had been
re-opened.

Cholera Breaks Out in Masindi
-----------------------------
A person is reported dead and 14 others infected with cholera
following an outbreak of the disease in Serule B village, Butaiba
parish in Biiso sub-county.

An official in the district health office, Mr William Mugayo, told
The Monitor that the outbreak was reported early in Mar 2004.

Biiso, a fishing community, is about 35 miles from Masindi town.
Initially, 11 people were receiving treatment, but Mugayo told The
Monitor that another 3 people were admitted to Butiaba Health Centre
last week.

There have been several cholera outbreaks in Biiso sub-county in the
past couple of years. Mugayo attributed this to poor hygiene and lack
of pit latrines in the area.

Recent outbreaks of cholera in Africa
--------------------------------------

Burundi
------
Since the beginning of Dec 2003 there have been several clusters of
cholera cases. As of 10 Feb 2004, the Ministry of Health has reported
a total of 236 cases including 6 deaths in the provinces of Bubamza,
Bujumbura, Bururi, and Citiboke. A WHO team is investigating the
outbreak. As cholera transmission in the outbreak is closely linked
to the lack of a safe water supply, a specific intervention for the
chlorination of drinking water has been implemented.

Cameroon
------
The Ministry of Health has reported a cholera outbreak in Cameroon
centred around Douala with 514 cases and 13 deaths (case fatality
rate, 2.5 percent). WHO, UNICEF, and Medecins sans Frontieres are
supporting local health authorities in outbreak control.

Mali
------
A cholera outbreak continues to affect Mali. From the beginning of
2004, a total of 280 new cases with 33 deaths (case fatality rate,
11.78 percent) has been reported in the regions of Mopti, Segou, and
Timbuctou. The control of the outbreak is very difficult due to the
spread of several clusters of cases throughout the country (i.e. 13
municipalities affected from 26 Jan to 1 Feb 2004).

WHO, with financial support from the Humanitarian Aid Office of the
European Commission, is providing medical supplies and specific
technical assistance to control the outbreak.

Mozambique
------
The Ministry of Health has reported a total of 9 391 cases and 61
deaths from 20 Dec 2003 to 16 Feb 2004 in 6 provinces (Gaza,
Inhambane, Maputo, Nampula, Sofala, Zambezia). Maputo city is the
most affected with 6124 cases and 32 deaths. With the absence of
heavy rainfall last week, the average number of cholera cases has
decreased.

South Africa
------
The Department of Health has reported a cholera outbreak in the
Nkomazi area, Mpumalanga province, which borders Mozambique. As of 11
Feb 2004, the cumulative number of cholera cases reached 179 with 5
deaths (case fatality rate, 1.7 percent).

Zambia
------
The cholera outbreak is still ongoing, mainly in Lusaka city. As of 9
Feb 2004, the Ministry of Health has reported a total of 3835 cases
and 179 deaths (case fatality rate, 4.66 percent).

Medecins sans Frontieres-Spain is supporting case management through
cholera treatment centres. WHO is providing medical supplies and
supporting local health staff. In addition, a WHO mission comprising
an epidemiologist and a water and sanitation engineer is currently
assessing the situation and proposing additional control measures.

Cholera Warning Issued for Thailand
-----------------------------------
The Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wed, 25
Feb 2004, that anyone traveling to Thailand and Southeast Asia where
cholera is prevalent must take care of one's hygiene.

9 cases of cholera have been discovered in Thailand, and the cases
were caused by eating uncooked food and drinking water that has not
been boiled, the center announced. If any traveler returns home with
suspicious symptoms like diarrhea and vomiting, the center requested
that the individual immediately report to the nearest quarantine
station or public health center.
