CDC reports 28 more EV-D68 cases, 1 polio-like illness
------------------------------------------------------
After several weeks with no new reports of enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) respiratory infections, the [US] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported 28 more illnesses, raising the national count since August [2014] to 1149 cases in 48 states and Washington, DC. But an official said the agency is not aware of any new case clusters. In addition, the agency has identified one more case of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM), a polio-like illness that involves unexplained limb weakness in children and seems related to EV-D68. The new AFM count is 94 cases in 33 states.

EV-D68, which was rare until recently, typically triggers cold-like symptoms but can cause a severe respiratory illness, almost exclusively in children, many of whom have asthma. The CDC says the pathogen has been the most common enterovirus identified in the United States this year. Before yesterday's [11 Dec 2014] update, the CDC count of EV-D68 cases had remained at 1121 in 47 states since [20 Nov 2014]. The new update mentions 48 states but does not name the new state added to the list.

CDC spokeswoman Jeanette St. Pierre, when asked about the increase in cases, said today [12 Dec 2014], "The number we are reporting includes cases confirmed by the CDC and the states. Sometimes there is lag time for the specimens reaching the CDC. We are not aware of a new cluster of cases." Regarding the AFM cases, a CDC official said recently that close to half of the AFM patients had tested positive for EV-D68 in nasal or stool samples, suggesting a likely link between the 2 conditions. But the connection was not certain, because the virus had not been found in any cerebrospinal fluid samples, which would signal infection in the nervous system.

The CDC has said that 12 patients died after EV-D68 infections, but it has not reported any conclusions about the role of the virus in the deaths, saying that determination is up to the states. The number of such deaths listed by the CDC has not changed recently. In October [2014], New Jersey officials said EV-D68 contributed to the death of a 4-year-old boy who died in his sleep.

The number of cases of EV-D68 continues to increase country-wide, as do cases of acute flaccid paralysis, but there is no new information that would definitively relate the 2 conditions. - Mod.CP
