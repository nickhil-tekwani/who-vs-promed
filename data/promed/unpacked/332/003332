Update on polio in central Africa - 25 Jun 2014
----------------------------
On [17 Mar 2014], WHO elevated the risk assessment of international spread of polio from central Africa, particularly Cameroon, to very high. A new exportation event from Equatorial Guinea demonstrates that the risk of international spread from central Africa remains very high (http://www.who.int/csr/don/2014_03_17_polio/en/). On [18 Jun 2014], Brazil reported that wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) had been detected in a sewage sample collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport in Sao Paolo state. Genetic sequencing indicates that this virus is most closely related to the virus that is circulating in Equatorial Guinea.

4 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in Equatorial Guinea in 2014. The index case -- Equatorial Guinea's 1st case to be reported since 1999 -- had onset of paralysis on [28 Jan 2014]; the country's most recent case occurred on [3 Apr 2014]. Genetic sequencing indicates these cases are linked to an ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Cameroon (Cameroon's most recent case was on [31 Jan 2014]). Equatorial Guinea [was] implementing outbreak response activities, with 3 National Immunization Days (NIDs) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) in April and May [2014], and plans for further NIDs in July and August [2014]. NIDs are deemed essential to stop the outbreak as [only] an estimated 40 percent of children are fully immunized against polio through the routine immunization programme in the country.

No one in Brazil has been paralyzed by the virus, nor is there evidence of transmission within the population of that country. This importation event in Brazil demonstrates that all regions of the world continue to be at risk of exposure to wild poliovirus until polio eradication is completed globally. It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio-affected countries and areas, strengthen surveillance for polioviruses (especially through the detection and investigation of acute flaccid paralysis or AFP cases) in order to rapidly detect any new virus importations and to facilitate a rapid response. Uniformly high routine immunization coverage should be maintained at the district level to minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction.

An analysis of immunity levels across central Africa found important immunity gaps in most countries in 2014, prompting the large-scale polio immunization campaigns that are ongoing in the area. In Gabon, a nationwide immunization campaign was held in June [2014] (with a further round planned for July [2014]), and in the Republic of Congo, a nationwide activity was conducted in May [2014] (another round is planned for June [2014]). Polio vaccination campaigns have been conducted where possible in the Central African Republic (May to June [2014]), with another round planned for accessible areas in July [2014].

WHO note
--------
There is no evidence to date that Brazil was re-infected by the poliovirus of Equatorial Guinea origin that was detected in a sewage sample collected in Sao Paolo State in March 2014; to date there has been no evidence of transmission of the virus in Brazil following this exposure.

Given Brazil's high levels of population immunity, reflected in the high routine immunization coverage (greater than 95 percent) and periodic vaccination campaigns, the lack of evidence so far of WPV1 transmission and the response being implemented, WHO assesses the risk of spread of this virus within or from Brazil as low.

WHO travel recommendations
------------------------
WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio.

On [18 Jun 2014], the National IHR Focal Point for Brazil reported the isolation of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from sewage samples collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport, in Campinas municipality in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Virus has been detected in the sewage only; sewage samples collected from the same site subsequent to the detection of WPV1 have been either negative or only positive for Sabin strains or non-polio enteroviruses; to date no case of paralytic polio has been reported. The isolate was detected through routine environmental surveillance testing of sewage water; there is no evidence of transmission of WPV1.

Genetic sequencing indicated a close match with a strain of WPV1 that was recently isolated from a case of polio in Equatorial Guinea. Additional epidemiological investigation is ongoing.

The Americas Region has been free of indigenous WPV transmission since 1991 and Brazil since 1989. There is no indigenous transmission of wild poliovirus reported in Brazil since 1989.

Brazil health authorities have enhanced their surveillance activity aimed to detect transmission of WPV1 and potential cases of paralytic polio as well as for any un-immunized persons. The vaccination coverage against polio in Sao Paulo State and Campinas municipality have been higher than 95 percent in the routine immunization program. The last national OPV campaign was conducted in June 2013. The campaign for this year [2014] is planned in November 2014 at the national level, and the target group is children 6 months to less than 5 years of age with OPV.

Specimens collected through environmental surveillance at this and other sites in Brazil since 1994 have consistently tested negative for the presence of WPV.

Given the high levels of population immunity indicated by the high routine immunization coverage and implementation of periodic vaccination campaigns in the area -- no evidence so far of WPV1 transmission and the response being implemented -- the World Health Organization (WHO) assesses the risk of further international spread of this virus from Brazil as very low.

Given the ongoing WPV1 outbreak in Equatorial Guinea, low national routine immunization coverage, and the inconsistent quality of the initial outbreak response vaccination campaigns, WHO assesses the risk of additional exportation from Equatorial Guinea as high.

WHO note
-----------
Brazil was not re-infected with WPV; the country was exposed to a poliovirus importation.

The environmental surveillance system had the capacity to detect the poliovirus in sewage samples, and the high immunity appears to have prevented transmission.

WHO travel recommendations
------------------------
WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Brazil has detected a poliovirus importation event. Based on current evidence, the country is not considered polio-affected.

Data in WHO as of 25 Jun 2013 for 2013 data and 24 Jun 2014 for 2014 data.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- On [18 Jun 2014], Brazil reported that wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) had been detected in a sewage sample collected in March 2014 at Viracopos International Airport in Sao Paolo state. Genetic sequencing indicates that this virus is most closely related to the virus that is circulating in Equatorial Guinea. No one in Brazil has been paralyzed by the virus nor is there evidence of transmission within the population of that country. This importation is a reminder of the importance of responding to the central Africa outbreak efficiently, of the critical need to vaccinate residents of Equatorial Guinea before international travel, and of the need for all countries to maintain high immunity against polio.

- In the Bara sub-division of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Pakistan, a successful door-to-door polio vaccination campaign took place for the 1st time in 5 years reaching more than 42 000 children. The campaign -- led by the FATA Secretariat and conducted by volunteers -- was made possible by new financial support from the United Arab Emirates.

- On [20 Jun 2014], the Polio Oversight Board (POB) -- made up of the heads of GPEI partners WHO, UNICEF, Rotary International and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and senior leadership from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation -- met for the 3rd time this year [2014] to examine progress against the Strategic Plan and review updates on GPEI management, financials and communications. Among other decisions, the POB endorsed additional activities to protect at-risk polio-free areas.

Afghanistan
------------
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV1 case in Afghanistan was reported from Dehrawud, Uruzgan province, with onset of paralysis on [20 May 2014]. The total number of WPV1 cases this year [2014] is 6.

- No cVDPV2 cases were reported in 2014. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3, with the most recent cVDPV2 case in March 2013 from Kandahar province, Southern Region.

- The most recent nationwide supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) were held on [4-6 May 2014] targeting 8.9 million children. The SIA could not be conducted in Helmand province, Southern Region, due to access problems related to insecurity but will be conducted as soon as access for vaccinators becomes possible. The next round of nationwide SIAs is planned for August [2014].

- According to the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio Eradication in Afghanistan, convened from [5-6 Jun 2014] in Islamabad, the country is in a strong position to interrupt endemic transmission of the virus in 2014, provided it addresses the remaining challenges and risks. These include ensuring the programme is a priority with the new government, reaching children in inaccessible areas, focusing on missed children, strengthening cross-border and transit vaccination and preparing for the displacement of people from infected areas of Pakistan.

Nigeria
-------
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week from the previously uninfected Sumaila LGA, Kano state, with onset of paralysis on [17 May 2014]. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2014 is 4.- Two new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week including one from Damboa LGA, Borno state with onset of paralysis on [2 May 2014], and one from the previously uninfected Gwale LGA, Kano state with onset of paralysis on [10 May 2014]. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 is 9.

- The most recent nationwide Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) took place on [12-14 Apr 2014] Subnational IPDs in northern Nigeria are currently ongoing ([19-26 Jun 2014]) and next rounds are planned for August [2014].

Pakistan
--------
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week from North Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) with onset of paralysis on [28 May 2014]. The total number of WPV1 cases reported from Pakistan for 2014 is 83.
- Six new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week including 3 cases from North Waziristan, FATA, and 3 cases from FR Bannu, FATA. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [27 May 2014] (from FR Bannu). The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2014 is 16.

- North Waziristan is the district with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus (both wild and cVDPV2) in the world. Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. Immunizations in neighboring high-risk areas are being intensified to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak. With thousands of people moving out of North Waziristan following the recent military operation against insurgents, the polio programme has been working with local government to identify displaced populations and reach them with the polio vaccine at either permanent transit points, or camps, or once they reach host communities.

- According to the Technical Advisory Group (TAG) on Polio Eradication in Pakistan, convened in Islamabad from [2-3 Jun 2014], the country is not in a position to interrupt transmission without radical change in reservoir areas including FATA, Peshawar, and Karachi. To put the program back on the path to polio eradication, the TAG recommended full political commitment and ownership, mobilization of national assets to facilitate access of vaccination teams, restoration of vaccination in FATA and addressing insecurity and chronic gaps in reservoirs and high risk areas. The TAG also recommended that all provinces integrate communications and social mobilization activities in their planning and operations.

Central Africa
----------
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week from Equatorial Guinea. The case is from the previously uninfected Mbini district in Litoral province and had onset of paralysis on [3 May 2014].

- The total number of WPV1 cases in Equatorial Guinea in 2014 is 5. The cases are linked to an ongoing outbreak in neighboring Cameroon, which has reported 4 cases in 2013 and 3 cases in 2014. The most recent NIDs in Equatorial Guinea took place on [28 May 2014], and the next rounds of activities are planned for mid-July and August [2014]. During the May [2014] campaigns, approximately 95 percent of children were reported to have been reached, though coverage has varied by area.

- In Cameroon, the most recent WPV1 case was reported from Djoungolo, Centre State, with onset of paralysis on [31 Jan 2014]. An analysis of outbreak response conducted so far indicates overall quality has been insufficient to interrupt poliovirus transmission. Due to subnational surveillance gaps, further undetected transmission cannot be ruled out. Given the continuation and expansion of virus transmission, additional emergency outbreak response activities are being planned and implemented. The most recent nationwide SIAs took place in late June [2014], with next rounds being planned for late July [2014].

- As part of the regional outbreak response, emergency campaigns have also been conducted in Central African Republic, the Republic of Congo and Gabon.

Horn of Africa
---------
- No new polio cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV1 case was reported from Jariban district in Mudug province, Somalia, with onset of paralysis on [11 May 2014]. The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa this year is 2.

- The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa is 219 since the beginning of the outbreak in April 2013 (195 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and 10 from Ethiopia).

- While the outbreak appears to have slowed down, the most recent polio case from Somalia indicates continued transmission of the virus. Outbreak response across the Horn of Africa is, therefore, continuing, with campaigns taking place this month [June 2014] in Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
-----------------------
- WPV1-positive samples were detected by environmental surveillance in Israel from February 2013 to end-March 2014. Since then, no WPV1-positive sample has been collected, although several samples are pending lab results.

- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted from August to October 2013.

- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has decided to re-introduce OPV into the national routine immunization schedule.

- Several WPV1-positive environmental samples have also been detected in West Bank and Gaza Strip last year [2013], with the most recent positive sample collected in the Gaza Strip during the week of [5 Jan 2014].

- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted [8-15 Dec 2013] and [8-15 Jan 2014].

Middle East
---------
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was due to WPV1 from Mada'in district, Baghdad-Resafa province, Iraq, with onset of paralysis on [7 Apr 2014]. The total number of cases in Iraq is 2.

- The total number of WPV1 cases reported from the Middle East is 38. In Syria, 36 cases are reported (35 in 2013 and one in 2014) with the most recent date of onset of paralyses on [21 Jan 2014].

- WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccination of all children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.

- In the Middle East, the 2nd phase of the comprehensive outbreak response is being implemented across the region. The WHO/UNICEF Strategic Plan for Polio Outbreak Response in the Middle East outlines the action plan for Syria and neighbouring countries in response to the circulation of wild poliovirus following importation.

West Africa
-----------
- In West Africa, no WPV cases have been reported since November 2012. The single most recent case of cVDPV2 was confirmed in July 2013.
- However, to minimize the risk of re-infection and further spread of poliovirus, multi-country, synchronized immunization campaigns continue to be implemented across the region with activities planned for Guinea and Niger in July [2014], and across the region in September [2014].

[There have been a total of 3 new cases of WPV1 confirmed since 18 Jun 2014 (see Poliomyelitis - update (11): Brazil ex Eq. Guinea, enviro. samples, global 20140622.2558067 for the 18 Jun 2014 update from the Polio Eradication Initiative website); 2of the 3 cases were in endemic countries (Pakistan and Nigeria), and one was a non-endemic country, Equatorial Guinea. As well described in the update, the polio activity in Equatorial Guinea is related to circulation of a WPV1 similar to that last seen in Cameroon, where vaccination coverages continue to be suboptimal. The hazards of the continued circulation of WPV both in endemic as well as in the non-endemic countries were highlighted earlier this week when information was provided on the isolation of a WPV1, genetically related to WPV1 currently circulating in Equatorial Guinea, in environmental samples in Brazil (see above WHO report and prior ProMED-mail post Poliomyelitis - update (11): Brazil ex Eq. Guinea, enviro. samples, global 20140622.2558067).

Disconcerting are the reports of cVDPV2 cases confirmed in the past week -- 2 in Nigeria and 6 in Pakistan. The presence of cVDPV serves as a further indicator of pockets of susceptibles as the vaccine derived virus would not be circulating in areas with adequate coverages. Where there are cases of cVDPV associated paralytic polio, the risk of WPV associated cases is high if the WPV is introduced. Since January 2014, there have been a total of 25 cVDPV cases (all type 2) confirmed: 16 in Pakistan and 9 in Nigeria (see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx).

Reading the weekly summaries by country can be disturbing for the repetitive statements about vaccination activities being suspended or postponed because of security issues, a sad situation.

For a map showing the locations of all confirmed cases of WPV associated polio in 2014, see the Polio Eradication Initiative map available at: http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Poliocasesworldwide.aspx. - Mod.MPP]
