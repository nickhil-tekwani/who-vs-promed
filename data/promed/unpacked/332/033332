Three cases of cutaneous anthrax have been notified in Moselle (one of the
departments -- that is, counties -- inside the administrative region of
Lorraine). This severe disease, extremely rare, is not contagious and
appears to have been transmitted to the victims from a cow slaughtered on a
farm.

3 people were hospitalised last week. Their health status is not "inspiring
anxiousness" (that is, their life is not endangered) according to the local
health authorities, which released the confirmation on 9 Dec 2008.
Epidemiological investigations showed they appear to have all been
contaminated during the on-farm slaughter of a bovine on 19 Nov 2008, on a
farm also located in Moselle. All 3 of them had handled the carcass. 21
people located next to the farm have been examined and did not present any
signs of disease, but have received a preventive treatment. All general
practitioners in the region have been asked to increase awareness.

An administrative doctor, Dr Michel Perette, is quoted saying that the
cutaneous form of anthrax is not contagious, does transmit from animal to
man but not between humans; he describes the signs and says there are only
2000 cases notified yearly worldwide.

Another member of the local health authority insists on the efficacy of
this disease being notifiable. It allowed a fast identification of the
source of infection. Samples have been performed "on the animal suspected
to have trasnmitted the disease." The local veterinary service has checked
and found no other animals affected on the farm.

[I am informed that one of the 3 was the affected worker in the nearby
German slaughter plant in Saarbruecken. So all 3 cases reported in the
previous post were infected from the same carcass. - Mod.MHJ
