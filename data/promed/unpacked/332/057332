A 2nd case of a rare mosquito-borne virus has been confirmed in New Hampshire.

The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services has identified a case of Jamestown Canyon virus [JCV] in an adult from Goffstown, although it's not clear whether the disease was acquired in the state or from a mosquito bite while the victim was traveling. The person's condition was not released.

In August 2017, an adult in Hanover was treated and released for the virus-caused illness, which apparently had been transmitted by a mosquito bite in New Hampshire.

Jamestown Canyon virus is found throughout the U.S. but produces few or no symptoms in most people, which makes it hard to judge how widespread it is. Only about 50 cases have been serious enough to be reported nationally since 2000.

Like West Nile virus and eastern equine encephalitis, Jamestown Canyon virus has the potential to cause serious health complications, including infections of the central nervous system.

Before this year [2017], it had been identified just twice in New Hampshire, in 2013 and late 2015.

Jamestown Canyon virus is one of several diseases carried by mosquitoes and ticks that have arisen in New England in recent years, partly because a warming climate allows them to spread and partly because of increased efforts for detection.

"We want residents and visitors to continue to enjoy the outdoors, but they should take steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites as long as mosquitoes are still around," said State Epidemiologist Dr. Benjamin Chan.

Until the 2nd hard frost of the season -- defined as 2 consecutive hours of temperatures below 28 F [-2 C] -- mosquitos are still active.

[The occurrence of JCV [Jamestown Canyon virus] in New Hampshire is not surprising. In addition to the previous New Hampshire case, a case occurred earlier this year (2017) in the neighboring state of Maine.

As noted in previous ProMED-mail posts, JCV was 1st isolated from a pool of 9 _Culiseta inornata_ mosquitoes captured in Jamestown Canyon, Colorado in 1961 and later shown to be widely distributed in the eastern and mid-western USA. Boreal [northern] _Aedes_ and _Ochlerotatus_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors. As with the other California serogroup Orthobunyaviruses, transovarial virus transmission is common, with newly emerging female mosquitoes already infected with the virus in the spring and ready to transmit it. White-tailed deer, _Odocoileus virginianus_, are the principal amplification hosts.

As Drs Charles Calisher and Paul Grimstad pointed out in ProMED-mail archive no. 20040807.2171, JCV frequently seems to be forgotten as an etiological agent of human disease. The previous report provided related references. - Mod.TY
