Trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in a tourist visiting Tanzania
------------------------------------------------------------------
On [Thu 30 Oct 2008], we received another case of African trypanosomiasis
in our clinic in Dar es Salaam. This time it concerned a 63 year old
American tourist/hunter (flown in through his Safari Company agent from
Arusha) who had been in the Northern areas of Tanzania, close to the
Burundi Coast, Kibondo, where he must have been infected 6-10 days before
the symptoms (which had started 3 days before). He was slightly confused at
arrival and severely dehydrated with a creatinine as high as 400 mmol/l.
His parasitaemia was not as high as that of the German patient we had last
year [2007], but considerable. He had 2 large chancres [painful swellings]
on the left leg, pictures were made.

The patient was too confused to recall the exact area of infection. It
would be either the area south of the Ngara-Kakonko-Kasulu-Kigoma road, or
Kibondo, as the travel agency mentioned those areas indeed. The area south
from the Ngara-Kakonko-Kasulu road is indeed a vast miombo wilderness
teeming with tsetse flies. The wilderness is clearly seen using through
Google Earth (<http://earth.google.com/>), entering "Kakonko, Tanzania" and
"Kasulu, Tanzania".

The other area reported was Kibondo, in the Karagwe area, and bordering the
Akagera Park in Rwanda. The latter is a well known focus of _rhodesiense_
trypanosomiasis. This would be the 1st time that we report a case from
these particular areas.

Thanks to Flying Medical Services in Arusha, [the patient] was flown in
late last night [1 Nov 2008] and treatment was started during the night, as
he could not be medical-evacuated to Nairobi until the morning.

Comment from WHO
----------------
The WHO human African trypanosomiasis control and surveillance programme
<http://www.who.int/topics/trypanosomiasis_african/en/> is following
closely the occurrence of HAT (human African trypanosomiasis) in disease
endemic countries through a strong network of key people providing update
information to allow quick reaction. At the same time WHO is providing
drugs free of charge for HAT cases in non-endemic countries in case of HAT
diagnosis in tourists or migrants.

[Trypanosomiasis is endemic in Central Africa and has been emerging in the
Congo DR over the past 15 to 20 years [see ProMED-mail Trypanosomiasis,
African: emerging (02) 20000816.1363].

In 2001, ProMED-mail reported 10 cases of trypanosomiasis in tourists
visiting Serengeti and Tarangire national parks, and an additional 2 cases
were reported in 2005. It seems that there still is a problem in north
western Tanzania. It should be noted that the cases in 2001 and 2005 were
infected in the Serengeti National Park, but this does not seems to be the
case now. - Mod.EP
