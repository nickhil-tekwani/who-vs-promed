Indonesia: avian influenza situation - WHO update 25
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in Indonesia reported that a 38 year old father who
died on 12 Jul 2005 was the country's 1st laboratory-confirmed H5N1
positive human case of avian influenza. His 2 daughters also died of severe
pneumonia illness compatible with H5N1 infection, but laboratory
confirmation is not yet available. Limited samples were available from the
8 year old daughter who died on 14 Jul 2005, and the 1 year old daughter
who died on 9 Jul 2005.
The 8 year old became ill with fever, diarrhoea, then cough, on 24 Jun
2005. She was brought to Siloam Gleneagles Hospital, Tangerang, on 28 Jun,
where she died with respiratory distress 20 days after onset. The 1 year
old became ill on 29 Jun 2005 with fever, diarrhoea, then cough, finally
respiratory distress, and died 10 days after onset. The father became ill
on 2 Jul with fever, mild cold, then cough and was taken to the same
hospital on 7 Jul where he died 10 days after onset. Samples from the man
tested positive for avian influenza H5N1 virus by the WHO H5 reference
laboratories at the Department of Microbiology, University of Hong Kong,
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta USA. Samples
from the 2 children are being tested.
The remaining 4 residents of the house (2 members of the family and 2
household workers) remain healthy and show no symptoms to date. The
Ministry of Health is closely following over 300 contacts, including health
care workers, family members, school and office colleagues and neighbours.
None of these contacts has shown any symptoms to date.
An investigation is currently underway with team members from Indonesia's
Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, United States Naval Medical
Research Unit 2, and WHO to identify potential sources of the infection.
Serum samples have been collected from contacts of the cases, starting from
the family and neighbours, health-care workers, while any possible poultry
contact is being investigated (such as market sellers, retail food outlets,
pet birds). Environmental and veterinary sampling is being carried out by
the Ministry of Agriculture.
Health education to hospital and other health care workers has been
continuing since January 2004, when avian influenza was first reported in
Indonesia. The Ministry of Health, working with WHO, has carried out
seminars and workshops to strengthen surveillance of influenza-like
illness, outbreak investigation, and appropriate isolation and barrier
nursing. Stockpiling of personal protective equipment to protect health and
veterinary workers, and procurement of antivirals for treatment and
prophylaxis, as appropriate, is continuing. Information has been provided
to assist the community with general health precautions, including frequent
handwashing, avoiding contact with sick animals, and safe and hygienic
handling and cooking of poultry.
