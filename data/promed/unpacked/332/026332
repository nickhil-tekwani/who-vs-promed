At least 8 people including 2 children died during a breakout of
cholera and diarrhea after deadly floods multiplied sufferings of
already ravaged people in Jaffarabad District in Baluchistan, Geo
News reported.

the last 11 days, while abject scarcity of drinking water and
shortages of food and medicines have let situation go from bad to worse.

cases/deaths of diarrhea are due to cholera is not clear but
significant diarrheal illnesses almost always occur in the wake of
such catastrophes. - Mod.LL]

The diarrhea, which claimed 2 lives and left over 700 ill in central
Kashmir's Budgam district, could be cholera as the patients have the
same symptoms and the authorities have started treatment on those lines.

Sources told Greater Kashmir that the preliminary investigations
suggested that the disease was cholera and the health department was
trying to hush up the issue to avoid international concern.

In the past few days, over 700 people in Budgam villages including
Reyar, Waterhaal, Kralnar, Harpanzu, and Shoolipora were hit by the
disease while over 150 people are still undergoing treatment at
health care centers.

[3] Cholera - China (Hong Kong) ex Indonesia

The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health
today (21 Aug 2010) investigated an imported case of cholera and
reminds people to observe good personal, food, and environmental
hygiene, whether in Hong Kong or traveling abroad. The case involved
a 30-year-old woman who came to Hong Kong from Indonesia on 17 Aug
2010. The woman developed watery diarrhea and vomiting the following day.

She attended Kwong Wah Hospital on 19 Aug 2010 and was admitted for
further management. She is now in stable condition. Laboratory tests
today showed that her stool specimen yielded positive result for
_Vibrio cholerae_ O1 Ogawa.

Her close contacts have no symptoms of cholera.

[As a short review, the flagellar (H) antigens of _V. cholerae_ are
shared with many water vibrios and, therefore, are of no use in
distinguishing strains causing epidemic cholera. The O (somatic)
antigens, however, do distinguish strains of _V. cholerae_ into 139
known serotypes. Almost all of these strains of _V. cholerae_ are
nonvirulent. Until the emergence of the Bengal (O139) strain (which
is "non-O1"), a single serotype, designated O1, has been responsible
for epidemic cholera.

There are 3 distinct O1 biotypes, named Ogawa, Inaba, and Hikojima,
each of which may display the "classical" or El Tor phenotype. The
biotypes are distinguished by their expression of surface antigens A,
B, and C. Ogawa contains antigens A and B; Inaba antigens A and C;
and Hikojima antigens A, B, and C. The latter serotype is relatively
rare. - Mod.LL]

A total of 3 people have died following a cholera outbreak in
Butaleja district. The district health officer, Dr Kenneth Mweru,
said 20 people were admitted at Nabiganda Cholera Treatment Centre in
critical condition. He noted that health authorities were monitoring
and sensitising the public on ways of preventing the disease.

Mweru said 6 of the 1st victims of cholera could have contracted the
disease from the funeral of one of the people who had died of the
disease in Busolwe town council.

[5] Cholera - Nigeria (northern states)

The death toll from cholera in northern Nigeria has risen to 283 from
231 within a week, according to various official figures.

The figure of those infected by cholera in the past 2 weeks has also
risen above 5000 from the earlier 4600 figure announced last week
[week of 16 Aug 2010], according to officials.

The latest outbreak was recorded in northeastern Yobe State where 42
people died in the past week from a disease health officials said was
a form of gastro-enteritis, characterized by vomiting and diarrhea,
which are also cholera symptoms.

"We have recorded an outbreak of gastroenteritis in Yobe State in the
last week which has killed 42 people and infected 443 others," Isa
Adamu, an official of the WHO in the state, said. "The disease has to
do with watery stool and vomiting which physically looks like
cholera, but we do not have the reagents in Yobe State for laboratory
analysis to confirm if it is cholera."

Cholera has also killed at least 4 people in a village in Kaduna
State in the past week as a result of contamination of open wells,
state health commissioner Charity Shekari told AFP.

In neighboring Katsina State, the disease killed 6 people and
infected 50 others in the last week, according to Bishir Babba, a
local official.

Last Thursday, 19 Aug 2010, health minister Onyebuchi Chukwu said 231
people had died of cholera while 4600 others were infected in some
states, particularly in the north with Borno, Bauchi, and Adamawa
being worst hit.

[6] Cholera - Nigeria (Adamawa)

The epidemic of the water-borne disease, cholera, continues to ravage
parts of northern Nigeria as no fewer than 20 persons, particularly
women and children, have been reported dead in Adamawa State in a
fresh outbreak. 168 persons have also been reported hospitalized in
various parts of the state. In the Southern parts, in Ganye II, of
Ganye Local Government Area, 10 persons, including an 85-year-old
woman, died of the disease at the weekend [21-22 Aug 2010], according
to the principal medical officer of Ganye General Hospital, Dr Daniel Tizhe.

Dr Tizhe told our correspondent that the outbreak of the disease was
reported to the hospital on 1 Aug 2010 and had treated 69 victims
while 10 of them died before they got to the hospital from the village.

The Director of Primary Healthcare in Ganye council, Alhaji Yakubu
Madi Nekenjumi, said he suspected the disease must have been spread
by residents from neighboring Cameroon Republic, which he said
claimed many lives in that country. In Madagali Local Government in
the northern part of the state, 10 persons out of 129 patients
hospitalized have died. The victims are from Sukur, Palan, Duhu, and
Gulak villages.

[7] Cholera - Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger
Date: Mon 23 Aug 2010

<http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=35695>


An outbreak of cholera in the 3 neighboring West African countries of
Cameroon, Nigeria, and Niger has infected nearly 4000 people and
killed more than 260 others since May [2010], the United Nations
health agency reported today [23 Aug 2010], blaming the epidemic on
poor hygiene and inadequate access to clean water.

Northern Cameroon, where more than 2800 cases -- including more than
200 deaths -- have been reported, is the worst affected area in the
Lake Chad Basin, according to the UN World Health Organization (WHO).

In Nigeria, some 830 cases and 30 deaths have been reported, while
240 cases and 16 deaths have occurred in Niger.

"We know that cholera is [a] food-borne disease. Food that has been
in contact with contaminated water is, of course, at high risk of
transmitting cholera to people," said Claire-Lise Chaignat, WHO's
cholera coordinator. "Good food hygiene is actually very important
for preventing the disease from spreading," she told UN Radio.

Ms. Chaignat said WHO and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) were
working together to combat the cholera epidemic, providing those
affected with oral rehydration salts to prevent deaths related to
diarrhoea, distributing chlorine for water treatment and carrying out
health education campaigns.

[8] Cholera - Kenya (Nyanza)
Date: Fri 20 Aug 2010

report [edited]
<http://www.kbc.co.ke/story.asp?ID=65945>


To date 5 people have died in Kuria West District in what doctors
suspect to be a cholera outbreak in the area. 3 of the victims died
in hospitals while the 2 others succumbed to acute diarrhea and
vomiting in Masaba and Mabera divisions.

At least 18 other people are admitted to various hospitals in Kuria
West and Migori Districts with similar symptoms and are still
receiving treatment.

Kuria DC James Mugwe said the medical workers had taken samples from
the patients to Kisumu for tests to ascertain the outbreak of the disease.

It is suspected that the outbreak occurred following an acute water
shortage that has hit Kehancha and Isebania border towns for the past
2 weeks, forcing the residents to use contaminated water from the
polluted Ragana river.
