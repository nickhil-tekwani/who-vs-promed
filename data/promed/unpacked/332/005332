California health officials warned consumers against eating raw mung-bean
spouts from Pacific Coast Spout Farms because of possible bacterial
contamination.
Officials linked the raw spouts with 45 cases of the food-borne illness,
_Salmonella enteritidis_, reported in Sacramento, Placer and Yolo counties
since March 26. Pacific Coast Sprout Farms recalled its product this week.
Most victims suffered diarrhea and cramping before recovering, but two
people with weakened immune systems were hospitalized with bloodstream
infections.
The Sacramento-based company distributed the mung-bean spouts under the
Pacific Coast Sprout Farms label in 12- and 16-ounce plastic bags and in
bulk. Consumers who purchased the raw sprouts prior to April 18 should
discard or return them to the place of purchase for a refund.
"At least some of the product was distributed in San Joaquin County," said
Lea Brooks, state Department of Health Services spokeswoman. A company
spokeswoman said Friday that spouts were sold to Safeway, Raleys and
Albertsons supermarkets in the San Joaquin County area. However, speaking
Friday from her Sacramento office, Brooks said that health officials still
were investigating whether any bean spout-caused
illness had struck San Joaquin County.
"We're just starting to look at what may or may not be going on in our own
county," said Dr. Karen Furst, San Joaquin County health officer, based on
reports from state officials. There was no unusual rise in salmonellosis
cases in the county, Furst said
Friday.
This is the first reported outbreak of salmonellosis associated with raw
mung-bean sprouts in the United States, state officials said. Previous
outbreaks were linked to raw alfalfa and clover sprouts. In the past, both
state and federal health officials issued advisories concerning alfalfa and
clover sprouts, and warned children, the elderly and people with weakened
immune systems against eating any raw sprouts.
