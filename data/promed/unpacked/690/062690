[In response to the request for information entitled "Undiagnosed disease -
Papua New Guinea (MR), RFI 20090828.3033", a correspondent has written in
favour of the suggestion that the undiagnosed disease currently afflicting
villagers in Papua New Guinea could well be influenza pandemic H1N1 2009
virus infection, since reports from New Zealand and Australia indicate
significantly higher levels of mortality among indigenous peoples (see:
Influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (35): NZ surveillance 20090827.3022).

New Caledonia is a small Pacific island located near New Guinea, and severe
disease has been reported from inhabitants there. The correspondent has
drawn attention to another report suggesting greater lethality of the
pandemic H1N1 2009 virus versus seasonal influenza and enhanced
vulnerability of indigenous peoples. Extracts from this analysis are posted
below. - Mod.CP]

1st estimation of direct H1N1 2009 pandemic virus
-------------------------------------------------
"We provide rough estimates of direct lethality from ARDS [acute
respiratory distress syndrome] due to the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus from 2
independent sources of data, one from New Caledonia, where 30 000
infections are assumed to have occurred and 3 deaths reported to be
attributable directly to the pandemic virus. Another source is Mauritius,
where 70 000 infections are estimated to have occurred and 7 reported
deaths from ARDS (5 of them are currently confirmed). These surveillance
data allow for 1st estimation of direct lethality due to the pandemic H1N1
2009 virus to be one per 10 000 infections, about 100 times more than
regular seasonal influenza.

"Influenza lethality is due to 3 main causes: 1st, direct viral origin
leading to viral pneumonia of high severity, with an acute respiratory
distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with 30 to 50 per cent lethality in
intensive care units (ICUs) [1 - this and other references are shown at the
above URL]; 2nd, bacterial super-infection due to pneumococcal,
staphylococcal, streptococcal, or meningococcal pneumonia, usually curable
with appropriate antibiotics, provided they are administered early enough;
and 3rd, decompensation of severe underlying conditions, often in elderly
people or in vulnerable chronic patients. The last is the predominant cause
of death attributable to seasonal influenza in developed countries and has
reached, for years now -- despite of the use of mass immunization in the
elderly -- a level of around one death per 1000 infections. This cause of
lethality is rarely reported as attributed to influenza in death
certificates, and therefore is not easily assessable during outbreaks, and
is usually measured as excess mortality when time series of mortality
become available, sometimes in real time, most often several months after
the season [2]. The 2nd cause, that is, bacterial super-infection, is much
less seen in developed countries due to antibiotic availability. However,
in the developing world, it may still be a cause of concern, since
bacterial pneumonia may rapidly become lethal if treatment is not given
appropriately in time. The direct lethality due to viral pneumonia gives
probably the best estimate of influenza strains' virulence, since it may
vary from strain to strain and is not due to the level of health
development of a country. Furthermore, ARDS always leads to ICU and is easy
enough to diagnose and to report.

Death from ARDS due to seasonal influenza
-----------------------------------------
"There are not many assessments available with regards to the incidence of
death from ARDS due to seasonal influenza in the literature. Empirical
evidence suggests that in France less than 5 to 10 of such cases are
identified each year, when an average of 6 million seasonal infections are
estimated from the French sentinel system [3]. We may, therefore, assume,
waiting for better estimates in the future, that deaths from ARDS due to
seasonal influenza are an exceptional event occurring once every million
infected patients.

Death from ARDS due to H1N1 pdm
-------------------------------
"It is too early to provide precise figures of deaths of ARDS due to the
new strain of pandemic influenza. In the USA, there is too large an
uncertainty reported regarding the denominator (i.e. number of influenza
infections), as is true of the UK and Argentina as well. In smaller areas,
and in particular in islands such as French New Caledonia or Mauritius, we
may have first rough estimates which may be more relevant and easier to catch.

"The French government estimated last week that 20 000 cases of influenza
had occurred in New Caledonia in the emerging outbreak, leading to a rough
estimate of 30 000 infections, and by 21 Aug 2009, 3 deaths of confirmed
cases were reported in patients aged 8, 27, and 58 years [4].

"The government of Mauritius estimated last week that 15 000 cases of
influenza had occurred in the last 2 weeks in Mauritius; however, some
reports from the media and recent personal communications from local
doctors lead me to estimate that about 50 000 cases actually occurred, and,
therefore, about 70 000 infections, taking into account mild illnesses. By
19 Aug 2009, 7 deaths had occurred; 5 of them were already virologically
confirmed in patients aged 4, 6, 28, 46, and 53 years [5].

"The New Caledonia and Mauritius figures are consistent with a rough
estimate of about one death from ARDS due to pandemic H1N1 2009 virus
infection per 10 000 infections, i.e. a virulence of 100 times that
observed for seasonal strains.

"We acknowledge that we are producing very rough estimates of direct
lethality associated with H1N1 2009 pandemic virus. However, it may be
useful to deliver such estimates as early as possible in the course of this
pandemic with the purpose of helping health authorities to check
availability of ICUs and artificial ventilation devices in their countries,
in case of a wave of similar virulence this fall [2009] in the northern
hemisphere. When assuming that half of ARDS are of lethal outcome, we may
assume that H1N1 2009 pandemic virus may generate one case of ARDS every
5000 infections. ARDS is always treated in ICUs, and 3 weeks of treatment
is probably an average period. In case of attack rates of 30 to 50 per cent
this fall and winter in the northern hemisphere [6], these figures may help
refine preparedness."

[It remains possible, as acknowledged in the New Zealand study, that the
enhanced lethality of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus in indigenous
populations may be a consequence of underlying health and other
inequalities. Further information on the outcome of the investigation of
undiagnosed disease in Papua New Guinea is awaited.
