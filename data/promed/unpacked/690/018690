[The following information comes from the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, Chapter 2.1.4B "Epizootic haemorrhagic disease" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.04b_EHD.pdf (NB: version adopted by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE in May 2014). For additional background information, including diagnostic methods and references, please refer to this chapter.

"Epizootic haemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an infectious noncontagious viral disease transmitted by insects of the genus _Culicoides_. Available data suggest that the species of _Culicoides_ that transmit EHD virus (EHDV) are likely to be similar though not necessarily the same as those that transmit bluetongue virus (BTV). The disease affects both wild and domestic ruminants, particularly North American cervids, and, to a lesser degree, cattle, although many countries describe only asymptomatic infection. Sheep and goats may be susceptible to EHDV infection but their role as hosts is uncertain.

"In susceptible species, EHDV may cause a disease with clinical manifestations similar to BTV infection. White-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) are the species most severely affected with the peracute form characterized by fever, anorexia, respiratory distress, and severe oedema of the head and neck. Swelling of the tongue and conjunctivae can also be present. In the acute (or classical) form, these clinical signs may be accompanied by haemorrhages in many tissues including skin and heart, and animals may develop ulcers or erosions of the tongue, dental pad, palate, rumen and abomasums.

"In cattle, the disease is characterised by fever, anorexia, ulcerative stomatitis, swelling of eyelids, respiratory distress, nasal and ocular discharge, redness and scaling of muzzle and lips, lameness, erythema of the udder and difficulty swallowing. Ibaraki disease in cattle is caused by a strain of EHDV-2). Animals become dehydrated and emaciated, and in some cases death occurs due to aspiration pneumonia. The lesions are histologically characterised by hyaline degeneration, necrosis and mineralisation of striated muscle accompanied by an infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes and histiocytes.

"EHDV is not known to cause disease in humans under any conditions.

"As a vectorborne viral disease, the distribution of EHD is limited to the distribution of competent _Culicoides_ vectors .The EHDV has been isolated from wild and domestic ruminants and arthropods in North America, Asia, Africa and Australia, and more recently in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Basin including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Israel, Jordan and Turkey. No cases of EHDV infection have been reported in Europe. Outbreaks generally coincide with the peak of vector population abundance, so most cases of EHD occur in the late summer and autumn."

In 2006, Tunisia reported EHD as an "emerging disease". 24 outbreaks were reported in different provinces of the country. See event summary and map at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=4383.

The extent of this event in the country and surrounding bordering countries will depend on the extent of the distribution of the competent vector. - Mod.CRD
