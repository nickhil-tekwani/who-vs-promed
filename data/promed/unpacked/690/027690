First Virological Data from Singapore Outbreak
----------------------------------------------
[The first virological data concerning the outbreak of Hand, Foot & Mouth
Disease (HFMD) in Singapore has just been released. One of the 2 children
(from the same family), who succumbed to the disease, was found to be
infected with Enterovirus type 71 (EV71).
However, both Coxsackie virus and EV71 have been isolated from other
children [diagnosed with HFMD during early stages of the outbreak. The
presence of adenovirus is not mentioned.
Child-care centres will probably re-open on Monday 16 Oct 2000 barring any
sudden increase in cases.

[ProMED-mail appreciates the assistance of Professor Chia in providing this
information. The press report also indicates that the outbreak of HFMD
appears to be in decline; only 91 cases were reported on 5 Oct 2000 in
comparison with the peak daily ate of 170 recorded on 3 Oct 2000. A total
of 4 children have died during the course of the outbreak, but most
children have now been discharged from hospital, and only 9 remain in
hospital. Hence the decision to reopen chid-care centres within the next
few days.
The virus identification results were reported by the Virology Lab of the
Pathology Department of the Singapore General Hospital; the assistance of
the CDC, Atlanta, has been sought in analysis of the outbreak, but no
results have been reported so far. The results are provisional, therefore,
and it is estimated that it will be 2-3 weeks before a definitive picture
is obtained. It is not clear from the press report whether the diagnosis is
based on virus isolation, PCR or serology. The simultaneous presence of
Enterovirus 71 and Coxsackie virus (type not stated) is unusual. - Mod.CP
