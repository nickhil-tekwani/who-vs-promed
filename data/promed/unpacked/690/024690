White blister, a damaging disease of brassica vegetables, was 1st
detected in Queensland in 2005 on a broccoli farm at Gatton in the
Lockyer Valley. Caused by the fungus _Albugo candida_, white blister
appears as yellow-brown spots on the upper surface of leaves with
small raised white blisters about 1-2 mm in diameter or pustules
underneath. Swellings may also be found on roots, stems and flowers.
The swellings and pustules contain masses of white dusty spores.

The disease mainly occurs in cauliflower and broccoli and has been
found in Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales in the past few
years. The disease causes the plants to distort and reduces the
marketability of flower heads and the production of seeds.

Dr Elizabeth Minchinton from Victorian Department of Primary
Industries (VICDPI) has researched white blister for several years
under a national vegetable levy funded project. Horticulture
organization Growcom invites brassica growers to attend a workshop to
hear Dr Minchinton outline the results of her research and her
recommendations for white blister management.

[White blister (also called white rust) caused by the fungus _Albugo
candida_ affects most plants of the brassica or crucifer family,
including a range of cabbage crops, radishes and oilseed rape. There
are several known races worldwide, each of which infects a limited
range of brassica species. A common strain of the fungus is widely
distributed throughout Australia and was known to occur in Queensland
on Chinese cabbage and some cruciferous weeds like Shepherd's purse.
However, a new strain has been recently identified in the Lockyer
Valley (a farming region between Brisbane and Toowoomba) which
infects broccoli and cauliflower crops.

The fungus may cause both local and systemic symptoms. Early local
symptoms of white blisters can only be seen on the underside of
leaves. Later, circular leaf discolourations appear on the upper leaf
surface corresponding to the blisters on the underside. These
symptoms may continue to develop after harvest, reducing potential
storage time. Systemic infections can cause abnormal growth and
distortion of affected plants leading to a significant reduction in
marketability of the vegetables and also affecting seed production.
Affected seedlings may be defoliated, which slows down their growth.
Swellings may be found on roots, stems, and flowers. The swellings
and pustules contain masses of white spores.

Fungal development is favoured by high humidity and temperatures of
10-25 C. The pathogen can be spread by wind, water, seed, on plant
material (for example seedlings for transplanting) and by mechanical
means, including common insect pests. For example, diamond back moths
(_Plutella xylostella_) carrying spores on their wings are thought to
have been responsible for the spread of the disease to Tasmania when
they were blown across by wind. Disease management includes clean
planting material (hot water treatment may be effective for seed
disinfestation), cultural practices (such as reduction of free
moisture, removal of weed reservoirs) and fungicides. Germplasm with
varying levels of resistance or tolerance to different white blister
strains is available, and new crop varieties are being developed.

The Queensland brassica vegetable industry is estimated at AUD 30
million [USD 27.5 million], which is about 20 percent of the
Australian industry. Crops are located primarily in the cooler
southern regions of Queensland, including the Lockyer Valley.
Cabbage, cauliflower and broccoli are the major crops, with smaller
quantities of Chinese cabbage and other Asian vegetables grown.
