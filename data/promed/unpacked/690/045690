Alarm over spread of cassava disease
-------------------------------
Cassava mosaic disease (CMD) which broke out in East and Central Africa
about 5 years ago continues to pose a big threat to food security in the
region, experts say. Delegates at a workshop in Kisumu said the disease
continues to spread, threatening the livelihoods of many people whose
staple food is cassava.

An official involved in the campaign against the disease, Dr James Legg,
told participants from Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, and the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that the virus was rapidly spreading
around the western side of Lake Victoria in Tanzania and some parts of the DRC.

Dr Legg, however, said a highly resistant cassava strain had been
introduced, and farmers had reported good results in disease control. He
added that more than 9000 hectares were under the new variety in western
Kenya, adding that tests were also being done in Uganda and Tanzania on
other high-yield and resistant varieties.

The director of the Kenya Agricultural Research Institute in Kakamega, Dr
Omari Odongo, said the government was determined to improve crops such as
cassava which required minimal inputs.

Dr Odongo said more than 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia,
and South America were dependent on cassava. Cassava is mainly grown in the
coast, eastern, central and western regions of Kenya.

[Farmers in sub-Saharan Africa produce over 85 million tons of cassava
annually. In addition to Kenya, major cassava-producing countries include
Nigeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania, Ghana, Mozambique, Uganda,
Madagascar, Angola, Cote d'Ivoire, Cameroon, and Benin.

CMD is a significantly persistent threat to cassava production and food
security in Africa. The virus (African cassava mosaic begomovirus) is
spread by whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_ and _B. argentifolii_) and by
planting infected cassava sticks. Disease management involves use of local
land races which have some degree of resistance to the virus as well as
well as cultivars produced by resistance breeding programs. The most
effective disease management options are use of CMD-free planting stock and
CMD-resistant cultivars.
