A 9 year old girl from Basilan has been added to the list of confirmed poliovirus cases in the country, according to Sam Nielsen's report on Super Radyo dzBB on [Mon 25 Nov 2019], citing the Department of Health (DoH). The new case brought the total number of new cases recorded nationwide this year [2019] to 8, the latest being the 3 recorded last week [week of 18 Nov 2019] in Cotabato. The report said the 9 year old from Basilan did not receive any vaccine against the virus.

The 1st [of the 3 patients recorded last week] is a 2 year old unvaccinated girl from Maguindanao who initially suffered fever and weakness in both legs. The 2nd case is a 1 year old unvaccinated boy from Cotabato City who experienced fever, cough, and weakness in both legs. The 3rd patient is a 4 year old girl from North Cotabato who showed fever and weakness of the right leg, neck, and facial muscles. She received doses of the polio vaccine but was not able to complete all the required doses.

A complete set of polio vaccine doses includes 3 doses of oral polio vaccine and 1 injected dose of inactivated polio vaccine, according to the World Health Organization. Polio re-emerged in the Philippines after in 19 years last September [2019] after a case was confirmed in Lanao del Sur.

[At the time the 3 additional cases were reported on Fri 22 Nov 2019, there was mention of 2-3 additional suspected cases under investigation. Presumably, this case was one of the aforementioned suspected cases. As a reminder, 6 of the 7 cases previously reported to WHO were due to a cVDPV2 (the 7th due to an iVDPV), so one presumes this newly confirmed case is most likely due to infection with a cVDPV2.

Basilan Province is an island province located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The island is the largest and northernmost of the major islands of the Sulu Archipelago and is located just off the southern coast of the Zamboanga Peninsula. This is part of the autonomous regions in the south of the country and geographically near to Mindanao where the other cases are from.
