The [Tennessee] state veterinarian is alerting horse owners of cases of equine infectious anemia (EIA), a potentially fatal bloodborne illness. Two horses in Shelby County, Tennessee recently tested positive for EIA. The stable is now under quarantine and animal health officials are testing additional horses on the premises.

"EIA is a devastating illness with serious consequences," state veterinarian Dr Samantha Beaty said. "Early detection is key to preventing the spread. Maintaining a current Coggins test on your horse is vitally important, along with practicing good biosecurity at home and on the road."

EIA does not cause disease in humans. However, it is very dangerous for horses because there is no vaccine or treatment. As a blood-borne illness, it is commonly transmitted through biting insects or sharing needles among horses. Symptoms may include fever, lethargy, swelling, loss of appetite, or colic. However, an infected horse may not show any clinical signs. If infected, horses must be permanently quarantined or euthanized.

State law requires a yearly Coggins test to check for the presence of EIA before any horse is transported from its home farm to a different location. Horse owners should consult with their veterinarian to establish a schedule for Coggins tests.

Tips to prevent EIA infection and spread include:
- separate symptomatic horses and contact your veterinarian immediately;
- do not share surgical or dental equipment that is contaminated with blood or debris between horses;
- keep the area in and around your barn clean and dry to reduce the insect population;
- apply fly sprays and insect repellants as needed.

The CE Kord Animal Health Diagnostic Laboratory offers pet owners and veterinarians testing services for equine diseases, including EIA, West Nile virus, equine herpesvirus (EHV), equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), and equine influenza virus (EIV). Contact your veterinarian for more information.

On 24 May 2021 Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) national reference laboratory confirmed positive infectious anemia (EIA) results for a horse in Watson Lake, Yukon Territory. The horse's owner had requested the test from an accredited veterinarian to comply with a facility's pre-entry requirements.

Per program policy, CFIA is investigating and has enacted an official quarantine for the animal and its on-premises contacts. Additional equines are reported as being on the affected premises. The quarantine will remain in effect until all disease response protocols are complete, including follow-up testing and ordering euthanasia of confirmed cases. According to policy, trace-out activities might call for the CFIA to enact program protocols at other premises.

Equine infectious anemia is a viral disease that attacks horses' immune systems. The virus is transmitted through the exchange of body fluids from an infected to an uninfected animal, often by blood-feeding insects such as horseflies. It can also be transmitted through the use of blood-contaminated instruments or needles.

A Coggins test screens horses' blood for antibodies that are indicative of the presence of the EIA virus. Most US states require horses to have proof of a negative Coggins test to travel across state lines.

Once an animal is infected with EIA, it is infected for life and can be a reservoir for the spread of disease. Not all horses show signs of disease, but those that do can exhibit:
- progressive condition loss;
- muscle weakness;
- poor stamina;
- fever;
- depression; and
- anemia.

EIA has no vaccine and no cure. A horse diagnosed with the disease dies, is euthanized, or must be placed under extremely strict quarantine conditions (at least 200 yards away from unaffected equids) for the rest of its life.

The following is extracted from the Equine Disease Communication Center's equine infectious anemia fact sheet (https://aaep.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Outside%20Linked%20Documents/DiseaseFactsheet_EIA%20Cobranded.pdf):

"Disease name: equine infectious anemia, EIA, swamp fever, Coggins disease.

"Disease type: virus.

"Transmission: equine infectious anemia is usually spread via mechanical transmission (transfer of the pathogen in the mouth of an insect) of blood from an infected horse by a blood-feeding insect such as a horsefly, deerfly, or stable fly, to an uninfected horse. EIA can also be transmitted iatrogenically via medical equipment such as needles, syringes, IV tubing, or other equipment contaminated with blood or through transfusion of blood or blood products from an infected horse. Transmission from mare to foal in utero has also been documented and the EIA virus has also been isolated from semen of infected stallions.

"Frequency: rare. [While the Equine Disease Communication Center and/or AAEP may deem the frequency rare, I think the number of postings on ProMED, as well as on state veterinary websites, would not classify this disease as rare. - Mod.TG]

"Incubation period: 15 to 45 days.

"Carrier status: horses having been infected with EIA are lifelong carriers. Horses showing clinical signs of the disease are more of a threat to healthy populations because of higher levels of viral load (concentration of the virus circulating in the blood).

"Shedding period: inapparent carriers can shed the virus, though the greatest risk of transmission is present when an infected horse is showing clinical signs.

"Latency: the virus can remain latent for the lifespan of the horse. Horses surviving the initial clinical phase of the disease usually become inapparent carriers within a year and then remain a reservoir for the disease for the remainder of their lifetime.

"Severity: high. EIA can be fatal, and all horses infected with the disease become lifelong reservoirs.

"Clinical signs:
- fever
- depression
- low platelet count
- anemia
- red or purple spots on the mucous membranes
- edema
- muscle weakness
- muscle atrophy

"Diagnosis: equine infectious anemia is diagnosed by testing antibody levels in the blood. The most common test used to diagnose EIA is called a Coggins test. Antibodies are detected by 2 tests, AGID (agar gel immunodiffusion), and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Both tests are available in many laboratories; the ELISA requires less time to receive results.

"Treatment: there is no treatment or cure for equine infectious anemia. Horses confirmed positive can be quarantined for the rest of their life but are usually euthanized.

"Prognosis: poor. EIA can be fatal and although horses can be subclinical carriers, they can shed the virus for the duration of their lifetime and are usually euthanized if confirmed positive for the disease.

"Prevention: there is no vaccine available for equine infectious anemia. Methods of prevention include vector control (insect control) to reduce the possibility of transmission, ensuring that needles and other medical equipment contaminated with blood are never shared between horses. Routine EIA testing should be performed to determine the status of the horses in an area and thus prevent transmission of the virus to horses nearby. Many equine events require a negative Coggins test within 12 months of the event to enter the facility.

"Practice vector management on all properties where horses are kept:
- use insect repellents frequently; re-apply after rain;
- keep horses in at night when possible and apply insect repellant;
- eliminate or minimize standing water;
- stock tanks or ponds with mosquito-feeding fish;
- eliminate brush piles, gutters, old tires, and litter;
- remove all equipment in which standing water can collect;
- practice fly control by managing manure piles and cleaning pastures

"Biosecurity: infected horses must be euthanized or quarantined with separation from non-infected horses by at least 200 yards to prevent the spread of the disease. Infected horses cannot be moved from the original premises during their lifetime except by special USDA approval (https://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahss/equine/eia/eia_umr_jan_10_2007.pdf). Practice vector control management on your facility to reduce risk of transmission from insects."
