[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Aquatic Manual 2016, Chapter 2.3.4 "Infectious haematopoietic necrosis" at, http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=2439&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_ihn.htm, from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Infectious haematopoietic necrosis (IHN) is a viral disease affecting most species of salmonid fish reared in fresh water or sea water. Caused by the rhabdovirus, infectious haematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), the principal clinical and economic consequences of IHN occur on farms rearing rainbow trout where acute outbreaks can result in very high mortality. However, both Pacific and Atlantic salmon can be severely affected.

The transmission of IHNV between fish is primarily horizontal and high levels of virus are shed from infected juvenile fish, however, cases of vertical or egg-associated transmission have been recorded. Although egg-associated transmission is significantly reduced by the now common practice of surface disinfection of eggs with an iodophor solution, it is the only mechanism accounting for the appearance of IHN in new geographical locations among alevins originating from eggs that were incubated and hatched in virus-free water.

IHNV is endemic and widely prevalent among populations of free-ranging salmonids throughout much of its historical range along the west coast of North America. The virus has also become established with a high prevalence of infection in major trout growing regions of North America, Europe and Asia where IHNV was introduced through the movement of infected fish or eggs.

IHNV has been detected in North America, Asia, and Europe, but not in the Southern Hemisphere. Countries reporting confirmed or suspect cases of IHN to the OIE include: Austria, Belgium, Canada, China (People's Rep. of), Croatia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, Japan, Korea (Rep. of), Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, and United States of America. Infections and overt disease have been reported among fish reared in both fresh and sea water."

Recommendations for international trade for Infectious haematopoietic necrosis are spelled out in chapter 10.4 of OIE's Aquatic Code at, http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=171&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_ihn.htm.

With this detection of IHNV in Kenya, it appears that this is the 1st official reported case of this disease on the African continent.
