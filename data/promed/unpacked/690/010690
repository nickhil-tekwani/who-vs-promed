In Benin, 3 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed according to laboratory reports released on 14 Jun 2022. Of these, 2 of the cases reportedly had recent travel history to Nigeria. The other case was detected in the north of the country with no reported history of recent travel.

Monkeypox (MPX) is a rare viral zoonotic infectious disease (i.e., an infection transmitted from animals to humans) that is endemic in areas in and near tropical rainforests in Central and West Africa.

The virus can spread both from animal to human (which is the 1st [spillover] event preceding the detection of cases in humans) and from human to human. Animal-to-human transmission may occur by direct contact with the blood, body fluids, the skin or mucosal lesions of infected animals (e.g., monkeys, squirrels, and rodents). This can happen through a bite, scratch, handling of, or eating inadequately cooked or other products of infected bushmeat. Human-to-human (person-to-person) transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with the virus from an infected human, or materials contaminated with the virus such as clothing, beddings. As a consequence, household members or healthcare workers are at greater risk of infection. The virus enters the body through broken skin (even if not visible), the respiratory tract, or the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. Human-to-human transmission may also occur through aerosols/droplets following prolonged face-to-face or close contact.

Symptoms of the illness include fever, headache, body aches, weakness, swollen lymph nodes (glands) and a rash. After about 1 to 3 days of fever, the rash erupts, beginning on the face and then spreading to the body with the face and palms/soles being mostly affected. They can also occur in and around the genitals, which is why contact during sex is one mode of transmission. It is mostly a self-limiting illness that often lasts for 2 to 4 weeks.

[The above report provides no details about the specific circumstances where monkeypox (MPX) virus infection might have been acquired in either Nigeria or Benin. Although ProMED has not posted a report of MPX in Benin before, a 1 Oct 2020 WHO Emergency Preparedness response summary stated that cases of monkeypox have been reported from other African countries -- Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Gabon, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Liberia, Nigeria, the Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan (see Monkeypox - Africa (08): Congo DR, WHO 20201002.7829916). MPX occurs sporadically in Nigeria, where 2 of the above MPX cases had recently traveled.

As mentioned frequently in previous MPX comments, monkeys are not the reservoirs of the virus, despite the name that the virus has received. The main reservoirs of MPX virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp., an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_. Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals to eliminate MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected. MPX virus can be transmitted between people but not readily. - Mod.TY
