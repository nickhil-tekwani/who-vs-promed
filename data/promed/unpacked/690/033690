Contaminated Food Sickened Six in Yonkers, Officials Say
-----------------------------------------------------------
YONKERS, May 17  After considering everything from cyanide poisoning to
bioterrorism, officials here say that six residents who became violently
ill Thursday night appear to have suffered from food contamination.
Two people were still listed in critical condition at St. Joseph's Medical
Center today, while three others were stable. A sixth person was treated
and released. The six went into respiratory arrest after eating dinner in a
Yonkers apartment. Others in the apartment who did not eat the meal did not
become sick, the police said.
Because an ambulance worker developed a rash after lifting one of the
victims, the police initially thought the incident could have been a far
more serious outbreak or attack. The rash is now believed to have been
either a coincidence or a result of contact with a victim's bodily fluids.
Until medical officials can pinpoint the cause of the illness, the
authorities are treating the case as a possible crime. "We are looking at
substances in the food," said the Yonkers police commissioner, Charles A.
Cola. "There are preservatives that can cause these symptoms. But at this
late date, we can say it wasn't cyanide."
The police responded to a call at 6:17 Thursday night for what appeared to
be an incident of food poisoning in a modest four-story row house, not far
from the city's downtown. But because of the severity of the symptoms and
the skin reaction of the medical technician, city officials went into full
crisis mode.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Westchester County district
attorney's office and a team of hazardous materials experts were all called
in. The neighborhood surrounding the apartment building was closed off, as
was St. Joseph's emergency room. And the American Red Cross started to set
up an emergency shelter at a nearby church.
"We're dealing with so many unknowns in our society, as we're all painfully
aware of," Mayor John D. Spencer said at a news conference. "As a
government, as a city, we have to be prepared to be overly cautious when
dealing with issues such as chemicals or strange occurrences, which this
was yesterday."
The six victims  four men and two women of Egyptian heritage who range in
age from 23 to 60  apparently used some ingredients that were brought to
the United States from Egypt, Commissioner Cola said. "Right now I'm
leaning toward this being a non-crime, based on medical advice that it
could have happened naturally," he said.
There was no move to recall any particular food item because a number of
ingredients were used in the dinner. "We don't know what it is, so how do I
say, `It's the A.& P.'?" Commissioner Cola said.
Dr. Nicholas E. DeRobertis, director of emergency services at St. Joseph's
Medical Center, said the list of substances that could provoke such a
reaction was "pretty extensive," including certain antibiotics and food
preservatives. The patients suffered from a condition he called
methemoglobinemia, which changes the red blood cells so that they cannot
carry oxygen to the body's tissues.
"When that happens, people come in with severe respiratory distress, a
bluish color and altered mental state," Dr. DeRobertis said at the news
conference.
Mr. Cola said the patients were immediately given an antidote for cyanide
poisoning as a precaution.
Foods from the meal were being tested at a federal Food and Drug
Administration laboratory in Queens, said Heather McGill, a spokeswoman for
the Westchester County Health Department. It was not known when the test
results would be made available, she said.

YONKERS, N.Y. -- Doctors blamed tainted food Friday for the sudden
illnesses that set off a chemical-contamination scare in downtown
Yonkers. The police commissioner said he doubted there had been any foul
play. Two of the victims remained in critical condition a day after the
outbreak of a rare blood-cell disease. Three were in stable condition and
one was released from the hospital.
"I'm leaning toward non-crime based on medical advice," said Commissioner
Charles Cola. "Nobody has told us this is something that somebody put in
the food." He added, however, that police were still treating the victims'
apartment as a crime scene and that "It would be presumptuous of me to rule
out foul play."
Mayor John Spencer said Yonkers was "back to normalcy" after spinning into
emergency mode Thursday night. The six victims had been taken to St.
Joseph's Medical Center with severe breathing problems, a bluish pallor and
an altered mental state. Some emergency workers reported picking up a rash
as they treated the patients, adding to the concern.
The hospital was closed briefly and police, firefighters,
hazardous-materials workers and even anti-terrorist agents streamed into
the area. The mayor mentioned the possibility of cyanide poisoning. A
decontamination shower was set up outside the victims' home. Air tests in
the building and at the hospital found no airborne contamination, however.
When police learned that people in the apartment who had not eaten did not
get sick, the investigation focused on the food. Cola said the victims,
who were identified only as being adults and of Egyptian heritage, were at
a dinner party featuring a dish with many ingredients, including a
processed food that they had brought in from Egypt.
"They became concerned about the taste of the food and quickly became ill,"
he said. He said the investigation was concentrating "on the apartment and
the food itself and the way it was prepared," rather than looking into
whether the victims had enemies who might have tampered with the food.
Dr. Nicholas DeRobertis, emergency director at St. Joseph's, said something
the victims ingested had changed their red blood cells into abnormal cells
that blocked the transfer of oxygen to tissue, a condition called
methemoglobinemia. It is unlike ordinary food poisoning, he said, in that
it is a respiratory rather than gastrointestinal illness. He said he had
seen it only once before, 15 or 20 years ago.
The doctor said the condition has more than 100 known causes, including
unsafe levels of nitroglycerin; the antibiotics known as sulfonamides; or
naphthalene, which is used in mothballs. It is also used in some food
preservatives, he said, but in that form would have to be ingested in "very
large quantities" to inflict the illness. He said tests that might show if
the food was tampered with could take weeks. The mayor said it was
premature to try recalls or other warnings about tainted food because
"there could be 100 different ways" that the toxin got into the food.

[The earlier reports on this event suggested cyanide poisoning and then
later botulism. The present reports state that the clinical picture was
consistent with methemoglobinemia. Cyanide poisoning can present with a
clinical picture similar to that seen with acquired methemoglobinemia. The
earlier report on possible botulism is difficult to understand other than a
clinical presentation of respiratory distress. A good review of
methemoglobinemia can be found at the Vanderbilt Medical College website:
<http://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/peds/pidl/hemeonc/index.htm>
Methemoglobin is an abnormal hemoglobin that is not capable of carrying
oxygen or carbon dioxide. In adults and normal children the level of
methemoglobin is less than 1% of the total hemoglobin. Acquired
methemoglobinemia (presence of methemoglobin in the blood) results when the
rate of formation of methemoglobin exceeds the rate of reduction after
exposure to certain compounds. Nitrites and aniline derivatives are
substances which most frequently produce methemoglobinemia. Because of its
use as a meat preservative and its similarity in appearance to table salt,
sodium nitrite is frequently the cause of methemoglobinemia. Nitrites are
also present in many medicinal agents. Mosts reports of nitrate- induced
methemoglobinemia, however, are due to infants fed well water contaminated
with high levels of nitrates. Nitrate salts are converted by enteric
bacteria to nitrites which are then rapidly absorbed from the
gastrointestinal tract. Silver nitrate used on burns is also a common
source as bacteria infecting burns may similarly cause nitrite production.
Aniline and its derivitives are found in many household products such as
inks, shoe polishes, paints and varnishes, and in some red and orange wax
crayons. Other drugs commonly associated with methemoglobinemia include
phenacetin, sulfonamides, and pyridium. Benzocaine, a common ingredient of
topical anesthetics has also been known to cause marked cyanosis from
methemoglobinemia.
Symptoms of methemoglobinemia include headaches, fatigue, coma, and death.
Headache, fatigue, tachycardia (fast heartrate), weakness and dizziness do
not appear until levels reach 30- 40%. At 50- 60% oxygenation of tissues
becomes truly inadequate resulting in dyspnea (shortness of breath),
acidosis, arrhythmias (irregular heart rhythms), coma, and convulsions.
Death occurs with concentrations of about 70% and greater. Treatment
involves general supportive care and removal of any offending toxins. The
drug of choice for treating severe methemoglobinemia is methylene
blue. Severe cases may require exchange transfusion or the use of
ascorbic acid.
Methemoglobinemia has been associated with ingestion of food products
containing toxic levels of nitrites/nitrates or other substances. An
outbreak in India (ref.1) was associated with ingestion of rice
contaminated with metanil yellow used for coloring the rice. Other
outbreaks have been associated with the use of excessive amounts of sodium
nitrate (saltpetre) in the preparation of sausages and other meat products
(refs. 2,3).
More information on the etiology of the methemoglobinemia in this outbreak
would be appreciated.
