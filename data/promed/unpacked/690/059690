Classical Swine Fever - Spain
-----------------------------
August 10: The Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC) yesterday voted in
favour of a European Commission (EC) proposal to reduce the area from which
exports of live pigs and porcine semen, ova, and embryos are banned.
Restrictions in the autonomous region of Catalonia will now apply only to
part of the province of Lerida (previously the whole province of Lerida and
parts of the provinces of Barcelona and Tarragona were subject to export
bans).
In the other area where there have been outbreaks of CSF (the provinces of
Valencia, Cuenca and Teruel), restrictions remain unchanged. Movement
restrictions within Spain can also be eased in non-affected areas under
control from the competent authorities. This proposal will be formally
adopted by the EC in the next few days and remain in force until 15 Sep
2001, with a review at next SVC on 11-12 Sep 2001.
