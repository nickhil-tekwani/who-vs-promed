Horse Case Of West Nile Encephalitis In Cape May, New Jersey
------------------------------------------------------------
Agriculture Secretary Art Brown Jr. said today that the death last week of
a 6-year-old Thoroughbred gelding in Tuckahoe, Cape May County, has been
attributed to infection with the West Nile virus (WNV), in conjunction with
other medical complications.
According to State Veterinarian Dr. Ernest Zirkle, the horse became ill on
27 Aug 2000, showing signs of neurological deficits, weakness, an elevated
temperature of 104Â° F and difficulty rising, all possible signs of equine
encephalitis. The horse had not left the farm for the past 3 months. The
horse was euthanized on 30 Aug 2000.
Samples from the horse were tested at the New Jersey Department of
Agriculture's Animal Health Laboratory for both Eastern and Western equine
encephalitis viruses as well as equine infectious anemia virus and WNV.
Because the animal had demonstrated some uncharacteristically aggressive
behavior, the laboratory at the Department of Health and Senior Services
(DHSS) also tested samples for rabies virus. Preliminary results from these
tests revealed an elevated [serum antibody titer that was later confirmed
as WNV-specific by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory (NVSL) in
Ames, Iowa.
Horses become infected with the WNV when bitten by infected mosquitoes. The
disease cannot be spread from horse to horse or from an infected horse to
humans or domestic pets. Not all horses that contract WNV become ill. Last
year, 25 horses on Long Island were clinically ill with neurological signs
and there was evidence of WNV infection. Nine of those horses died or were
euthanized. However, samples from clinically normal horses that were
stable-mates of the affected horses showed that more than one-quarter of
them had also been infected with WNV but never exhibited any symptoms of
the illness.
Although there is no preventive vaccine for WNV, equine encephalitis is a
reportable disease in New Jersey and is treated symptomatically. Concerned
horse owners should contact their veterinarians for additional information
or consultation about specific cases of illness in their animals.
For more information on WNV or mosquito spraying, or to report dead birds
and areas of standing water where mosquitoes breed, residents should call
their local or county Departments of Health and mosquito control agencies
or visit the web sites maintained by DHSS , DEP
, the CDC , and NJDA

[This year, the first horse diagnosed with WNV was located on Staten
Island, [the epicenter of the utbreak. Since then, a horse in
Massachusetts and another in Rhode Island have been diagnosed with the
disease. The New Jersey Department of Agriculture, in collaboration with
the State Department of Environmental Protection, DHSS and USDA, has
launched a proactive campaign to educate horse owners about the precautions
they must take to decrease mosquito habitats, which is the only defence
against the disease. Recommended actions include decreasing mosquito
habitats near homes and stable areas by emptying standing water from cans,
tires, swimming pool covers, clogged gutters or other reservoirs which can
serve as mosquito breeding sites and by frequently changing the fresh water
in drinking troughs to prevent them from becoming breeding sites. -Mod.CP
