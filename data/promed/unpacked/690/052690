Utah is experiencing a surge in gonorrhea cases, and health officials are attempting to combat it. According to the Utah Department of Health, gonorrhea diagnoses rose 393 per cent between 2011 and 2014. Cases of the sexually transmitted disease increased 717 per cent among women and 296 per cent among men. The age groups that saw the biggest increase in cases were 15 to 25 year olds and 30 to 34 year olds.

"We're certainly not the only place in the country seeing a rise in cases," says Lynn Beltran, from the Salt Lake County Health Department. "We went from having 200 cases a year to 1000 cases in 2015, and 40 per cent of those are female."

Half of affected women show no symptoms. Some women may mistake gonorrhea symptoms for a bladder or vaginal infection. Gonorrhea symptoms include a painful or burning sensation when urinating. Men may experience a white, yellow or green discharge from the penis. Women may experience increased vaginal discharge or vaginal bleeding between periods.

Beltran says incidences of gonorrhea are on the rise because "attitudes about sex have become more liberal. People are not taking sexual wellbeing as seriously as they used to. They aren't afraid of STDs [sexually transmitted diseases] anymore." She recommends that people get tested frequently and "take that seriously." The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends annual testing. Anyone who is sexually active can get gonorrhea. To reduce risk, CDC says you should use latex condoms every time you have sex and limit sexual activity to a monogamous relationship. "Pick one partner," says John Kriesel, MD, an infectious disease specialist at University of Utah Health Care.

Gonorrhea can cause infections in the genitals, rectum and throat. It can be treated with antibiotics. If left untreated, Kriesel says, it can lead to infertility in women and urethritis, epididymitis or even sterility in men. The Utah Department of Health offers low-cost testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia and free treatment.

[Gonorrhea rates in the United States as a whole in 2009 decreased to 98.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest rate since recording of gonorrhea rates began. Between 2009 and 2012, the gonorrhea rate increased each year to 106.7 cases per 100 000 population in 2012. In 2013, the gonorrhea rate decreased slightly to 106.1 cases per 100 000 population. However, in 2013, for the 1st time since 2000, the rate of reported gonorrhea cases among men was higher than the rate among women; during 2009-2013, the rate among men increased 20.3 per cent, while the rate among women decreased 2.0 per cent (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/natoverview.htm). The increase among men compared with a decrease among women suggests either increased transmission or increased case ascertainment (for example, through changes in screening practices such as increased testing and increased extra-genital screening) among men who have sex with men (MSM) (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/natoverview.htm).

Utah, among US states, and Salt Lake City, its state capital, among metropolitan areas, had the lowest incidences for gonorrhea (under 19.0 per 100 000 population) for the years 2008-2012 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats12/figures/14.htm), but the rate rose to 33.3 in 2013 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/tables/13.htm). Unlike the data for the US as a whole, the incidence of gonorrhea among women in Utah in 2013 increased 5-fold of what it had been before 2012 and about 2.4-fold among men (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/tables/15.htm and http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats13/tables/16.htm). The male-to-female (M:F) rate ratio, a surrogate measure used to monitor occurrence of gonorrhea among MSM, have decreased in Utah from 3.8 in 2009 to 1.5 in 2013. (M:F rate ratios in excess of 1:1 suggest male-to-male transmission).

_Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ has progressively developed resistance to each of the antibiotics used for treatment of gonorrhea. Dual therapy with ceftriaxone plus either azithromycin or doxycycline is now the only treatment regimen for gonorrhea recommended by CDC. The percentage of isolates that exhibit elevated ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) increased from 0.1 per cent in 2008 to 0.4 per cent in 2011, and decreased slightly to 0.3 per cent in 2012. The proportion of isolates with elevated azithromycin MICs decreased from 0.5 per cent in 2010 to 0.3 per cent in 2012.

The US state of Utah has a population of about 2.9 million, about 80 per cent of whom live along the western edge of the Rocky Mountains, centering on Salt Lake City (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah). With about 62 per cent of the Utah population reported to be members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints or LDS (Mormons), Utah is the only state with a majority population belonging to a single church; but in 2013, the US Census Bureau estimated that Utah had the 2nd fastest-growing population of any state (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah). - Mod.ML
