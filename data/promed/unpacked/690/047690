At least 19 people have become sick with suspected cases of _E. coli_
after eating at a fast food restaurant in eastern Iowa, local health
officials said Saturday [9 Dec 2006].
"What we have is suggestive of _E. coli_, but we do not at this point
have a confirmatory test," Tom O'Rourke, director of the Black Hawk
County Health Department, said. Final test results are expected
Monday [11 Dec 2006].
He said 14 of the people who became ill have been hospitalized.
O'Rourke said he could not identify the restaurant where the people
ate, but said it had been sanitized and all the food replaced.
An outbreak of _E. coli_ bacteria linked to Taco Bell fast food this
week sickened 63 people in 6 states, U.S. health officials said
Friday [9 Dec 2006]. About 49 people have been hospitalized, and 7
have experienced kidney failure.
The Food and Drug Administration said it expected the number of
confirmed cases to increase in the next few days, since a number of
other cases were being investigated.
Shares of Taco Bell parent Yum Brands Inc. fell more than 2.2 percent
Friday [9 Dec 2006] after an analyst downgraded the stock and raised
concerns that the outbreak could have a significant impact on its sales.
_Escherichia coli_ is a usually harmless bacteria found in the gut of
animals, including humans. A new and pathogenic strain called _E.
coli_ O157:H7 was identified in 1982. It causes about 73 000 cases of
infection and 61 deaths in the United States each year.
Most illness has been associated with undercooked, contaminated
ground beef. But if contaminated manure gets into irrigation water or
is used in fertilizer, it can get onto fresh produce or into the water supply.

[It is apparent that the initial newswires on this outbreak were
mixing outbreaks, mentioning a combined outbreak of respiratory and
diarrheal illness (see ProMED-mail posting: Undiagnosed illness - USA
(IA): RFI 20061208.3470). The above alert suggests diarrhea with a
hemorrhagic component, seen most often with shigellosis, _E. coli_
and amoebiasis. It appears as though _E. coli_ is the suspect here.
In another newswire from Radio Iowa
<http://www.radioiowa.com/gestalt/go.cfm?objectid=A5EDB7F7-64BB-4632-A3E91D16EA77C2AA&dbtranslator=local.cfm>,
there is mention that this outbreak was not related to the other
ongoing _E. coli_ outbreak related to green onions in a fast food
chain (see ProMED-mail postings referenced below). More information
on this outbreak in Iowa would be appreciated as it becomes available
(etiologic agent, source of contamination, etc.). - Mod.MPP]
