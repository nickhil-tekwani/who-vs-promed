China: avian influenza situation - WHO update 5
-----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health in China has reported 2 additional laboratory
confirmed cases of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.
Both patients are in critical condition.
The 1st patient is a 9 year old girl from the eastern province of Zhejiang.
She developed symptoms on 10 Feb 2006. Symptom onset followed a visit to
relatives in the adjacent province of Anhui. No animal outbreaks have been
reported in Zhejiang Province since 2004.
The 2nd patient is a 26 year old female farmer from Anhui Province. She
developed symptoms on 11 Feb 2006, following contact with diseased poultry.
Local agricultural officials have reported isolation of the H5N1 virus in
samples from dead poultry in her neighborhood.
To date, China has reported 14 laboratory confirmed cases. Of these, 8 have
been fatal. The H5N1 virus is now considered to be endemic in birds in
large parts of China. WHO is working with national authorities to increase
public awareness of the disease, encourage populations to report outbreaks,
and warn people to avoid contact with dead or ill birds.
