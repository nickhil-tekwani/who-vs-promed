Hundreds of dead snapper have washed up on Coromandel beaches, leaving
holidaymakers perplexed. People at Little Bay and Waikawau Bay, on the
north east of the peninsula, were stunned when children came out of the sea
with armfuls of the fish and within minutes the shore was littered with them.

A resident, whose family have lived at Little Bay for the last 30 years,
said she had never seen anything like it. "It was so surreal," she said.
"It's such an incredible waste -- it could've fed the whole northern tip of
the Coromandel."

People with binoculars said the snapper stretched as far as they could see
and boaties reported "a carpet of floating fish further out to sea all
along the coast".

"We initially thought 'woohoo a free feed' but they had really cloudy eyes
and you could see the birds had been at them. Some of them had no eyes,"
the Little Bay resident said.

Her parents called the Department of Conservation and were told it was most
likely the fish had starved due to weather conditions, but Pearsall did not
think that was the case as many of the fish looked big and healthy. The
Fisheries Ministry are currently investigating the situation and said they
could not yet say what the cause was.

"Any commercial operators must record and report their catch," said
ministry field operations officer for Waikato, Bay of Plenty and the
Coromandel Brendon Mikkelsen. "They're equally as concerned as we are ...
it's not in anybody's interests for fish to be abandoned at sea."

Mikkelsen said it had happened before but given the quantity of fish it was
very concerning. People saw floating snapper in the water as early as 5:00
am yesterday [4 Jan 2011] but the ministry only received reports 12 hours
later. Mikkelsen urged people to get in touch as soon as they saw anything
amiss.

[Surely some of these fish have been sent to a laboratory for proper
necropsy and testing. I might suggest red tide, but there have no reports
of red tide this time of year near New Zealand. Hopefully we will have an
authoritative report soon.
