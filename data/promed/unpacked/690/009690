[This is an update of a previous outbreak reported February 2008 -
see Rift Valley fever, buffalo - South Africa: (Mpumalanga), OIE
20080210.0541. In total, there have been 12 outbreaks prior to the
one reported here. The 1st outbreaks were in Mpumalanga (n=4) and
Limpopo (n=3) provinces and later outbreaks occurred in Gauteng (n=3)
and North West (n=2) provinces. The outbreaks, which have affected
buffalo, cattle, sheep and goats, have registered 349 cases and 103
deaths as published by the OIE-WAHID database. A map is attached to
each OIE report and provides a good overview of the affected farm locations.

Often times, Rift Valley fever occurs after unusually high rainfall,
and persists until the climate moderates so that it is no longer
favorable for increasing the number of vectors of this mosquito-borne
disease. Please see the previous comments of Bob Swanepool in Rift
Valley fever - South Africa (02) 19990311.0369. Since there seems to
be an adequate vaccination strategy in place, wet conditions may be
contributing to the persistence of the virus in the animal population.

To date there have been no human cases reported, but knowledge of the
factors favoring persistence of the virus would be helpful. - Mod.PC

The absence of reports of human cases is quite remarkable, given that
a 2007 outbreak spread from Kenya to Somalia and Tanzania, killing
more than 100 people in each country (see ProMED refs. below). - Mod.JW]
