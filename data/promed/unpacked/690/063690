The Namibian Director of Veterinary Services in Windhoek has reported an
outbreak of African swine fever that began about 23 Mar 1998. Through
postmortems done on a small herd kept on a cattle farm [location
uncertain, but likely to be Namaqualand - DP]), which is now under
quarantine. Of the 60 susceptible pigs, there have been six cases, all
fatal. Contaminated feed is suspected to be the cause of this outbreak, the
country's first since April of last year.

[The usual mode of spread for this disease are argasid ticks, _Ornithodorus
moubata_, and sometimes by pig lice, _Haematopinus suis_. A few years ago
there was an interesting outbreak in Zambia when the Pope visited, thanks to
a priest, stationed in the bush, coming into Lusaka for the papal ceremonies
with pork for the seminary from an infected pig. The left overs were fed,
unfortunately, to the seminary's pigs. - Mod.MHJ]
