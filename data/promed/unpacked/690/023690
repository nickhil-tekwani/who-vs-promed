The bacterium that causes legionnaires' disease has been found in the water system of a South Bronx [New York City] apartment building. So far, one of the buildings of the Melrose Houses has tested positive for _Legionella pneumophila_ bacteria. 2 other buildings have tested negative, and test results are outstanding on 5 other buildings in the complex. Residents got flyers Wednesday evening [2 Sep 2015] notifying them of this new case of _Legionella_ bacteria. They also had a community meeting [Wed 2 Sep 2015] night and needless to say, a lot people are both worried and frustrated they now have to go through this again.

"A lot of people are complaining about it. They need to fix it, it's been going on for some time now," a resident said. As a result, the Health Department is having NYCHA [New York City Housing Authority] shut off hot water at the building that tested positive and will install water filters in every apartment unit that will eliminate the bacteria. Hot water service will be restored as soon as the filters are installed.

There have been 4 cases of legionnaires' at the Melrose Houses in the South Bronx over the past 6 months: one occurring earlier in the year [2015], 2 during the recently ended South Bronx outbreak, and this most recent case. Only 1 patient is currently being hospitalized; the other 3 previous patients have been treated and released. Test results at Melrose House are as follows: 681 Courtlandt Avenue tested positive, 304 East 156th Street and 700 Morris Avenue tested negative.

Although the water is safe to shower, bathe, and drink, people living there say they're scared and don't understand why this keeps happening. Health officials say they're also working on a long-term disinfection plan for the entire complex.

Adults with flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, should seek immediate medical attention.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said on [Thu 3 Sep 2015] that city health officials are investigating whether there is a connection between new cases of legionnaires' disease in the Bronx and an outbreak earlier this summer [2015] that killed 12 people.

The Health Department said 4 cases of legionnaires' disease had been identified at the Melrose Houses in the South Bronx; one person has been hospitalized.

Health Commissioner Mary T Bassett had announced [Wed 2 Sep 2015] that a preliminary test found the presence of _Legionella pneumophila_ bacteria in the water system of one of several buildings, which don't have cooling towers. 2 other buildings tested negative and tests of 5 others were still being processed.

The Melrose Houses, an 8-building public housing complex with more than 1000 residential units, covers more than 12 acres [about 5 ha].

The Health Department said it has moved to shut off hot water in the building at 681 Courtlandt Ave, where a test revealed the presence of the bacteria. Health officials said the department will work to install water filters in every apartment unit.

Health officials, who are coordinating with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are also working on "long-term plans for disinfection."

The city's deadliest-ever legionnaires' disease outbreak, which killed 12 people and sickened 116 others in the South Bronx earlier this summer [2015], was declared over on [20 Aug 2015]. The source of the outbreak had been traced to the cooling tower of the Opera House Hotel on 149th Street.

No one had reported the onset of legionnaires' symptoms since [3 Aug 2015]. Symptoms, which include cough, shortness of breath, high fever, muscle aches, and headaches, usually begin 2 to 10 days after exposure to the bacteria.

[From the news reports above, there is 1 new, currently hospitalized case of legionnaires' disease in a resident of Melrose Houses, an apartment complex in the South Bronx. There were 3 other prior cases in residents of this housing complex of 8 buildings, only 1 building of which has a positive hot water system culture for _Legionella pneumophila_. The buildings don't have cooling towers. 2 other buildings in the complex tested negative and tests of 5 others are still being processed.

The 2nd news report above says that no one had reported the onset of legionnaires' symptoms since 3 Aug 2015, but does not mention if this includes the current hospitalized patient.

We are not told in which buildings the 4 Melrose House complex-associated cases resided. The 3 prior cases were likely attributed to exposure to the Opera House Hotel outbreak in the South Bronx last month [August 2015]. It would be important to know if genotypes (or genetic data if available) of _Legionella_ isolates from the 4 Melrose House complex residents match the Opera House Hotel isolate or the Melrose House isolate. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
