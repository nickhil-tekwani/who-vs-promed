A new outbreak of African swine fever in South Ossetia and Georgia
------------------------------------------------------------------
According to the Agriculture Department of the [Republic of] South
Ossetia, mass death of domestic pigs was registered in the Republic
regions bordering Georgia. More that 200 animals died, and the dead
and infected animals had signs characteristic of African swine fever
[ASF]. The diagnosis of ASF was made according to the laboratory
studies of samples taken from dead and infected pigs from Tebota and
Garistav settlements of the Zanurskiy Region and the Orchosan
settlement of the Leninogorskiy Region. Today [17 Nov 2010] mass
deaths of pigs were registered in Georgia, so its territory has been
quarantined.

According to the Territorial Administration of the Rosselkhoznadzor
for the [Republic of] North Ossetia-Alania, no cases of pig deaths or
infections have been registered in the territory of the regions
bordering South Ossetia.

A special meeting of the Commission on Prevention of ASF in North
Ossetia-Alania has been held and measures aimed at prevention of
introduction of the infectious agent into the Russian territory have
been defined.

[A look at the map
<http://www.colorado.edu/ibs/waroutcomes/pics/ethnicMap.jpg> will be
helpful in comprehending the apparent common ASF epidemiology in
South Ossetia and Georgia. In both territories, the ASF virus was
reportedly circulating during 2007.

The ASF history in Georgia is currently covered in 2 separate OIE
reporting summaries, each accompanied by a map showing the area
affected, as follows:
1. The whole country:
The epizootic reportedly started 23 Apr 2007, involving 6 reports
concerning a total of 58 outbreaks throughout Georgia. The final
report was submitted on 16 Jan 2008, announcing the epizootic as
resolved. See at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5720>

2. Abkhazia Autonomous Republic:
The epizootic reportedly started 23 Jul 2007, involving 2 reports
concerning 2 outbreaks. The 2nd (final) report was submitted on 3 Mar
2009, indicating that the outbreak had been resolved on 29 Jul 2007.
See at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=5932>.

The current renewed circulation of the virus in a Russian territory,
as apparent from the information above from Russia's official
website, is expected to be reported to the OIE.

Official information (confirmation or otherwise) of renewed ASF
circulation in Georgia will be appreciated. - Mod.AS]
