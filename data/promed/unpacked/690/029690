Agence France Presse reported today that an agricultural official in
Guangdong province said that the 1.7 million chickens that died there
between Nov 1996 and Apr 1997 died "from bacteria and diarrhea" due to farm
mismanagement and inexperience, and their deaths "had nothing to do with
bird flu."
Hiroshi Kida, a WHO official in Taiwan had said last week that China had
covered up an outbreak of avian influenza. The Guangdong province is in
southern China, bordering the administrative region of Hong Kong.
