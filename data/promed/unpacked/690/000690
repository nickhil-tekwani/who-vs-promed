A Comment on Post-exposure Treatment of Rabies in Pakistan
----------------------------------------------------------
Inevitably there needs to be an aggressive campaign of dog control in
Karachi in particular and Pakistan in general. Human rabies has been
eliminated in the West by stringent dog control strategies. Stray dogs have
to be eliminated and pet dogs vaccinated. (A similar strategy has been
successful in peninsular Malaysia). In Pakistan, with its poor economy,
debt servicing, and heavy defense expenditure, this also has to be the main
strategy for combating rabies. We may also lack technical expertise in
controlling the increasing dog population in Karachi. This just [reflects
on the performance of our public health infrastructure in Pakistan.
There are 2 major public rabies post-vaccination sites in Karachi: The
Civil Hospital and the Jinnah Post-graduate Medical Center (JPMC). The JPMC
in Karachi stopped using sheep brain vaccine [after analysis of 2 samples
of sheep brain vaccine revealed absence of antigen. The tests were run at
Pasteur Merieux Connaught Laboratories in France (the manufacturer of vero
cell rabies vaccine). Anyway [even in the case of better vaccine,
vaccination has to be supplemented by the use of immunoglobulin.
Purified vero cell vaccine (PVCV) and purified duck embryo cell vaccine
(PDECV) can be used in cheaper intradermal doses. At the Aga Khan
University we calculated that the cost of sheep brain vaccine is equivalent
to intradermal vaccination regimens, particularly using the Thai Red Cross
intradermal (TRC-ID) regimen. In an unpublished study conducted at the Aga
Khan University in Karachi, the average total cost of a course of 17 shots
of sheep brain vaccine would be Rs 1414 (direct and indirect costs:
excluding the side effects of neuroparalytic reactions and vaccine
failures), whereas PVCV or PDECV in TRC-ID regimen would cost Rs. 1000 and
in the Oxford regimen 1800 Rs. Intradermal regimens would be particularly
suitable at the Civil Hospital Karachi (which deals with 10 dog-bite
victims daily) because the vials come in 0.5 ml size in the case of both
PVRV and PDECV and can be consumed in a day.
The Thai Red Cross Intradermal Regimen: The TRC-ID consists of giving 0.1
ml intradermally (as with BCG) at 2 sites on days 0,3, & 7 and at 1 site on
days 28 and 90. Vaccines that are diluted in 1 ml require 0.2 ml per
intradermal dose using the same schedule.
The Oxford Regimen: This consists of 0.1 ml intradermally with PVCV or
PDECV at 8 sites on day 0, at 4 sites on day 7, and at one site on days 28
and 90. The Oxford regimen provides an earlier antibody response, which may
be beneficial in areas of the world where immunoglobulin is either
unavailable or unaffordable.
PDECV is manufactured by the Swiss Serum Institute, Berne, Switzerland and
PVCV is manufactured by Pasteur Merieux Connaught. Both sera were
available in Pakistan. I don't know if purified chick embryo vaccine is
available in Pakistan: The cost of the 5 dose IM regimen "Essen" can be
reduced from US 78-83 dollars to US 31-33 dollars.
Immunoglobulin is essential in severe bites: In Pakistan physicians have a
choice between the expensive human rabies immunoglobulin costing 293 US
dollars or equine rabies immunoglobulin costing 35 US dollars for
equivalent doses. Equine rabies immunoglobulin is given 40 IU/kg and most
of it is given around the wound. There might be a fear of anaphylaxis, but
with the new purified and pepsin-digested equine immunoglobulin, the rate
of serum sickness is only about 1 percent and the anaphylaxis rate is 1 in
40 000. (2 manufacturers distributing in Pakistan are [the Swiss Serum
Institute, Berne, Switzerland, and Miles, USA)
In a study we conducted in 1995 at the Civil Hospital Karachi, a large
public referral center, only 31 percent of victims' wounds were washed
properly
with soap and water by either victim, general practitioner, or hospital
physician. (See: Postexposure Treatment of Rabies in Pakistan. Shehzad
Parviz, Stephen Luby and Henry Wilde. Clinical Infectious Disease.
1998;27). It is very important that the wound be washed thoroughly with
soap and water followed by application of a virucidal antiseptic such as
tincture of iodine or alcohol.
