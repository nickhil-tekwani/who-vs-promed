Indonesia: 6-year Old Girl is Suspected Avian Influenza Case
-----------------------------------------------
The Indonesian authorities on Sat 17 Sep 2005 urged people to remain
calm after it confirmed a 4th death from avian influenza virus
earlier this week [3rd week September 2005] and decided to take tough
action to contain the spread of disease. "We appeal to the public to
help us by remaining calm. We will work very hard to minimize this
disease so that it will not spread further," the website of the
Jakarta Post quoted Health Minister Siti Fadillah Supari as saying.
Meanwhile, I Nyoman Kandun, the Ministry's Director General of
Disease Control, said on Saturday [17 Sep 2005] that a 6-year-old
girl was also being treated in Jakarta as a "suspected case" of avian
influenza.
Commenting on mounting international concern that [avian influenza
virus] could mutate into a major killer, Nyoman said Indonesia would
carry out "comprehensive efforts" to stop further outbreaks. Birds
will be vaccinated, people visiting infected areas will be monitored,
hospitals will be told how to cope with bird flu patients and an
information campaign on the virus will be launched, he said.
Indonesia launched a massive vaccination drive against the disease
after a man and his 2 daughters died of bird flu in suburban Jakarta
in July 2005 but has been criticized for carrying out only limited
culls. The World Health Organization requires that poultry within a
radius of 3 km (1.9 miles) from any bird flu outbreak be killed.
Health experts have warned that the [H5N1 avian influenza virus]
could spark a global pandemic if it developed the ability to spread
quickly among humans.

Indonesia: Neighbor of Fatal Case of Avian Influenza is a Suspected Case
-----------------------------------------------
Indonesia yesterday [16 Sep 2005] confirmed its 4th human death from
the bird flu virus, taking the death toll in Asia to 63, and said it
was investigating whether a neighbor of the victim [had also
contracted] the disease.
Tests from a Hong Kong laboratory showed that a 37-year-old woman who
died last week [2nd week September 2005] had contracted the H5N1
avian influenza virus, said I Nyoman Kandun, the Health Ministry's
Director General for illness control and environmental health. The
Health Ministry also said that a neighbor of the woman had been
hospitalized with symptoms consistent with avian influenza. But the
authorities said they were still awaiting lab results before
confirming she [had contracted H5N1 avian influenza virus infection].
Kandun warned that Indonesia would continue to report cases, because
the virus was rife in poultry farms across the country. "It will be
like in Viet Nam and Thailand," he told reporters.
The virus has swept through poultry populations in large swaths of
Asia since 2003, resulting in the deaths of tens of millions of birds
and 63 people, most of them in Viet Nam and Thailand. Indonesia
recorded its 1st human fatalities from avian influenza in July 2005,
when a father and his 2 daughters died after contracting the virus.
Officials have linked those deaths to droppings from an infected
bird. Kandun said the source of the latest infection was not yet
known.
He said surveillance of poultry needed to be stepped up, but urged
the country's 210 million people not to panic. "Be alert, but do not
be alarmed," he said. Officials have carried out limited vaccinations
of some of the estimated 2 billion birds in the country, but say they
lack funds to carry out culls of flocks in areas where the virus is
prevalent. The virus has been recorded in 22 of Indonesia's 32
provinces since 2003.
Most of the human deaths from bird flu have been linked to contact
with sick birds. But the World Health Organization has warned that
the virus could mutate into a form which is more easily transmitted
from human to human, possibly triggering a pandemic that could kill
millions worldwide. Indonesia confirmed its 4th human death from bird
flu on Friday [16 Sep 2005] and said another person was suspected of
having the virus, as global alarm grew that the disease would mutate
and become a pandemic. Speaking in New York on Thursday [15 Sep
2005], World Health Organization chief Lee Jong-wook said the virus
was moving toward becoming transmissible by humans and that the
international community had no time to waste to prevent a pandemic.

[ProMED-mail acknowledges receipt of a similar piece of information
from David Price. The above reports mention 2 additional suspected
cases of avian influenza; a 6-year-old girl and a neighbor of the 4th
confirmed case. It is not clear from the texts of the reports whether
these statements refer to the same or to different individuals.
It should be noted that, with regard to the cluster of 3 deaths in
the same family referred to in the above reports, WHO has stated that
H5N1 infection was confirmed in the 38-year-old father but that
laboratory test results for his 2 daughters did not meet criteria for
acute H5N1 infections (see part 2 of "Avian influenza, human - East
Asia (125): Indonesia, conf. 20050916.2736"). WHO reports only
laboratory-confirmed cases. Therefore, the number of confirmed human
cases of avian influenza in Indonesia is 2, not 4 as repeatedly
stated by the Indonesian authorities. - Mod.CP]
