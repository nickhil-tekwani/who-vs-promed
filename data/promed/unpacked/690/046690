Typhoid is threatening to run amuck in parts of the old city of
Hyderabad, while the urban health centers of the district health
department have been acting as a mute witness to the spurt in
infirmities. Neither the health centers nor the health camps are able
to effectively extend medical facilities to the needy.
On the contrary, the private clinics are coming to the rescue by
keeping their doors open even up to 11 pm. for patients. Typhoid and
other fevers have gripped the Teegalakunta, Nawab Saab Kunta, Ansari
Road, Kaalapathar, Bilalnagar, and Ramnaspura areas of the old city.
On Sun 15 Jul 2007, alone, about 6 typhoid patients were admitted to
private clinics of Bilalnagar, Ramnaspura, and Kaalapathar.
"The civic situation is appalling here. Drinking water supply gets
mixed up with sewage leading to such outbreaks," says Dr. Khateeja
Begum of Makkah Health Center, Kaalapathar.

The typhoid fever outbreak that has affected at least 6 villages in
Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur [Province], has been traced to a spring
water-impounding project where residents draw their drinking water,
officials said on Sat 14 Jul 2007.
Mahelinde Colminares, Davao del Sur health chief, said water samples
taken from the spring in 'sitio Ragobrob' in Saliducon village turned
out positive for the bacterium that causes typhoid fever. "The water
from that spring is not potable," she said.
Colminares said that because of this, they have advised residents of
barangay [district] Zone 1, Zone 2, Zone 3, Zone 4, Tuban, and
Tagabuli to refrain from drawing water there.
At least 200 people have been affected by the outbreak that started 3
weeks ago. She said if they have no other sources, they should first
boil the water tapped from the spring before drinking it.
Asked about the possible cause of the contamination, Colminares said
they found out that residents near the spring failed to practice
proper waste disposal. She said bacteria that grow on human waste
could seep underground and contaminate water sources, especially if
these are near the surface.
