Since the 1st detection (23 Dec 2011), an increasing number of farms with abortions, stillbirth, and congenital malformations have been observed in ruminants in Belgium. These included 13 cattle farms (all found negative), 34 sheep farms (of which 23 tested positive) and 2 negative goat farms. So far, suspect samples from 94 lambs, 17 calves and 5 newborn goats have been tested, among which 49 lambs proved positive. At the farm level, the average percentage of ewes giving birth to SBV-positive lambs is around 32 per cent, with even 3 of the 4 ewes in one outbreak.

The affected farms are distributed throughout the north of the country (see map at http://www.favv.be/_pictures/users/Schmallenberg_20120113.jpg), confirming a broad distribution of the virus as described in the Netherlands [for the updated Dutch data, see commentary].

23 (historical) blood samples taken during the months of September and October 2011 from cattle presenting with fever and milk-drop syndrome have also been tested by RT-PCR. Three of them tested positive, confirming the circulation of the virus during the autumn [of 2011] in Belgium, 2 of them originating from the north of the country, one from the south of Belgium.

Comparative analysis of different brain and thymus samples from the same animal resulted in the finding that RT-PCR performed on the thymus is less sensitive than on the brains.

[ProMED-mail is grateful to Dr van den Berg and his colleagues for the above firsthand update. The current information on earlier (September-October 2011) clinical cases in Belgian cattle was not published earlier. Germany and the Netherlands reported fever and milk-drop syndrome (as well as diarrhea) in dairy cattle in August-September 2011. From such animals, the SBV was isolated in Germany.

The SBV situation in the Netherlands (as of noon, 16 Jan 2012), is as follows:

Cattle holdings: tested 63, positive 0
Sheep holdings: tested 88, positive 63 (72 per cent)
Goat holdings: tested 7, positive 2 (29 per cent)

The last update of the Dutch Minister of Agriculture to the Parliament on the SBV situation was submitted on 13 Jan 2012; see (Dutch) at http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/bestanden/documenten-en-publicaties/kamerstukken/2012/01/13/kamerbrief-stand-van-zaken-schmallenbergvirus-13-01-2012/kamerbrief-stand-van-zaken-schmallenbergvirus-13-01-2012.pdf.

A map on the German SBV situation, as of 11 Jan 2012, is available at http://www.tierseucheninfo.niedersachsen.de/ps/tools/download.php?file=/live/institution/dms/mand_24/psfile/docfile/85/Schmallenb4f0f1ce0c88cc.pdf&name=Schmallenberg-Virusinfektionen_in_Deutschland_Uebersichtskarte_des_FLI_Stand_11012012&disposition=attachment. A current update is anticipated. Pictures of cases in lambs in Germany are available at http://www.tierseucheninfo.niedersachsen.de/ps/tools/download.php?file=/live/institution/dms/mand_24/psfile/docfile/29/Fotos_Schm4f0f1b4ec90eb.pdf&name=Missbildungen_bei_Schaflaemmern_infolge_des_Schmallenbergvirus&disposition=attachment.

The Netherlands and Belgium have submitted to the OIE reports on SBV, defined as an "emerging disease" according to OIE's code stipulations. The initial Dutch notification was submitted on 5 Jan 2012; a follow-up report has been submitted on 16 Jan 2012, available, with a map, at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11447. Belgium submitted its initial notification on 12 Jan 2012 (see ProMED-mail posting 20120113.0095).

For the OIE definition of an emerging disease, see the code's glossary at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=glossaire.htm#sous-chapitre-2. - Mod.AS
