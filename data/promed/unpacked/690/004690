Health officials are investigating a suspected outbreak of typhus after 3 officials from the Department of Antiquities reportedly contracted the bacterial disease while excavating an ancient burial site in the Nicosia District.

Speaking to the media on Tue 17 Jun 2014, archaeologist George Filotheou confirmed that on 2 Jun 2014 the officials were excavating an archaeological site near Denia Village when they developed high fevers. They were immediately rushed to Nicosia General Hospital where they were administered medication and later released. However, they were admitted again on Mon 16 Jun 2014 and are currently being kept under medical supervision.

Community leader of Denia, Christakis Panayiotou complained that he had contacted the Health Services in February [2014] to report an influx of rodents in the area but had had no response. "We were told that the area must be cleaned, but there has been no response."

Commenting on the suspected typhus outbreak, Health Services Chief Christos Christou said the authorities are looking into the matter and confirmed that pest control experts will most likely visit the community today [18 Jun 2014] to spray the affected areas.

[There are 5 classical diseases with typhus literally or figuratively in their names: epidemic typhus, Brill-Zinsser disease (recrudescent epidemic typhus), murine typhus, scrub typhus, and typhoid (so-called because it is typhus-like). The term typhus comes from the Greek, _typhein_ -- to smoke -- which may refer to the smokey or clouded mental status that patients present with. Murine typhus, caused by _Rickettsia typhi_, is distributed widely throughout the world, especially in the warm and humid coastal environments of tropic and subtropical climes and certainly exists on Cyprus, as this publication and its associated abstract shows:

Abstract
-----
Epidemiological and clinical data of 193 human cases of murine typhus in Cyprus were recorded and analysed during a 9-year period (2000-2008). The incidence rate was estimated at 24.5 cases/100 000 population/year. The incidence rate varied considerably between rural, urban and semi-urban areas, with residents in rural areas accounting for 79.3 percent of the total cases. Most (72.5 percent) of the cases occurred in late summer (July and August) and early autumn (September to October) with a peak in September. Well-established persistent endemic foci with clusters of cases were identified and characterised as "high risk" areas. Presence of or contact with rats and fleas, presence of domestic/peridomestic animals, and residence in rural areas, especially locations near the "green line" (a narrow zone patrolled by UN forces that separates the northern and southern parts of the island), increased the possibility of murine typhus infection. The results of the current study enhance the belief that murine typhus is a serious public health problem in Cyprus. - Mod.LL
