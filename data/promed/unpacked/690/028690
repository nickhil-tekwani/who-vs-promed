Canker spreads to groves in county
-------------------------------------
State agriculture officials are destroying hundreds of acres of citrus
trees in 2 groves in Hillsborough County, and inspecting others nearby,
because of citrus canker [CC]. With about 400 acres affected so far, the
1st commercial outbreak in Hillsborough in several years has ratcheted up
concern of citrus industry officials that more and more acreage might be
lost to Florida's USD 9.1 billion citrus industry.
According to Casey Pace, spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Mutual trade
group, CC is a big concern for growers. CC is a disease that is not harmful
to humans, but makes brown splotches on citrus fruit. Fruit can drop from
trees, and yield is cut by almost half. Denise Feiber, spokesman for the
Florida Department of Agriculture's division of plant industry, said
pathologists have confirmed that recent outbreaks of CC in Hillsborough,
Polk and Hardee counties were spread by last year's [2004] hurricanes.
The state's Citrus Canker Eradication Program had the disease nearly
contained to South Florida, but the storms blew the canker throughout
Central Florida. "It's not good news for stopping the spread of canker,"
she said.
In May 2005, canker was found in orange trees in Ruskin in the nearly
90-acre Dooley Groves owned by Mike Houghtaling and at Deseret Farms, a
286-acre grove owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,
Feiber said.
The division of plant industry also confirmed that CC has infected trees on
a farm owned by Dennis Carlton near Dooley Groves and Deseret Farms. The
agency also is investigating suspected CC on a farm owned by Hillsborough
Ranch Corporation, which is about 3 1/2 miles south of Ruskin.
Thousands of citrus trees are being pushed out of the ground by heavy
equipment and burned on site, Feiber said. Growers will have to wait at
least 2 years before they can replant.
The U.S Department of Agriculture reimburses growers USD 55 for each mature
tree under the eradication program.
Louis Haverlock, who owns 770 acres near Balm in southeastern Hillsborough
through Lou Ross Citrus Inc., said many long-time growers aren't
replanting. Instead, he said they're giving up on the battle with
hurricanes and CC and getting up to USD 16 000 an acre from developers.

[There appears to be no respite from the CC outbreaks in Florida. The
involvement of high winds in spreading the pathogen (_Xanthomonas
axonopodis_ pv. _citrus_) is a major factor in the spread of the bacterium
to citrus groves. - Mod.DH]
