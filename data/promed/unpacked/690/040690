The United Nations has designated the 12th of May as the annual International Day of Plant Health (IDPH). This is one of the main legacies of the International Year of Plant Health 2020 (see ProMED post 20190206.6303482). The main objective is to raise global awareness on how protecting plant health protects biodiversity, the environment, and agricultural development.

A virtual event will take place on [12 May 2022]: https://www.fao.org/plant-health-day/en

[The establishment of the original International Year of Plant Health by the United Nations and its continuation by now declaring an annual day of awareness recognises the urgency of the issue, accompanied, unfortunately, by a general lack of progress. Plants are the foundation of life on earth and, furthermore, "Plant Health is Earth's Wealth".

In the face of global climate change and population explosion, a broader acknowledgement of this fact seems decidedly overdue. The efforts of FAO, the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the UN, must be applauded as a means to raise awareness of the significance of protecting both crop and non-crop plants and so to preserve ecosystems, essential for the continued survival of all animal species, including humans. The vital urgency of finding solutions to these issues cannot be over-emphasised (see links below).
