It began in January [2013]. At 1st, there were only a few. But as the weeks went on, more sea lion pups washed ashore. The dehydrated, emaciated pups showed up on Southern California's beaches, tucked under trucks and lifeguard towers. One was found huddled in a flower pot.

In late January [2013], scientists surveying Channel Island sea lion rookeries reported something worrying: Pups out there were in bad shape. By early February [2013], regional marine mammal rescue centers were concerned.

The strandings hadn't stopped. Instead, the pace was picking up.

Now, hundreds of these little animals have been admitted to rescue centers between Santa Barbara and San Diego. For a non-El Nino year, the numbers are much too high too early. Something is going badly wrong offshore, and no one knows what it is yet.

"We're in the process of trying to understand what is actually causing this," said Sharon Melin, a wildlife biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service. "The stranding centers in Southern California are being inundated with animals. It hasn't hit the northern centers yet."

As of 13 Mar [2013], 517 pups had been admitted to 5 southern California rescue centers. That total is higher than the total for some entire years, said Sarah Wilkin, regional strandings coordinator with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "And we're only 2 months and a week in."

The stranded animals are about 9 months old; most were born around June 2012. At this age, sea lion pups normally weigh between 25 and 30 kilograms (55-66 pounds). The animals coming ashore weigh about half that, Melin said. She's visited the island colonies several times recently, 1st in September 2012 and again in February 2013, and noticed that the pups hadn't gained much weight between visits. "Normally, they would have doubled their weight by February," Melin said.

She and others suspect the pups have weaned themselves early and left their colonies. Not yet strong enough to find food on their own, they strand themselves on the mainland in a last-ditch effort to save energy and survive. Why they're leaving home early is an open question.

By the time the pups are rescued, many are too far gone to be saved, Wilkin said. Dehydrated, emaciated, and malnourished, those who can will spend several months in a rehabilitation facility, gaining weight and nourishment before being returned to the sea.

Rescue and rehab groups in the area are struggling to keep up with the onslaught. The pace of admissions is still accelerating, Wilkin said, noting that both Los Angeles County and Orange County admissions doubled last week [3-9 Mar 2013].

So far, Marine Animal Rescue, based in El Segundo, has rescued 170 sea lion pups, said director Peter Wallerstein. "The pups are hypothermic, dehydrated and skinny," he said. Marine Animal Rescue brings those pups to the Marine Mammal Care Center (MMCC) in nearby San Pedro for treatment.

"We have admitted over 250 [pups] since 1 Jan 2013," said MMCC's director David Bard. "We normally have numbers in the teens for those animals."

Once admitted, pups are examined, tested for disease, and started on a treatment program. Nutritional supplementation begins with clear fluids, then moves on to "gruel," a mix of electrolytes, protein, sugar, and ground up fish, until eventually the pups are fed solid, fishy food. The process can take several months. "Overall, they've been responding very well," Bard said, on 13 Mar 2013. "We actually released 4 of them this morning."

Right now, the San Pedro facility is caring for more than 100 pups. Down the coast, the Pacific Marine Mammal Center has more than 90. On 12 Mar 2013, that facility declared a state of emergency after 18 rescues over 2 days threatened to overwhelm existing resources. Farther south in San Diego, SeaWorld reports more than 140 marine mammal rescues this year [2013], the majority of which are California sea lions. In all of 2012, SeaWorld rescued 131 marine mammals.

"The good aspect to this is that emaciation and dehydration are something the rehab facilities are very experienced with, and doing a good job," Wilkin said, reporting that mortality rates in the centers are relatively low, between 20 and 30 percent.

But the bad news is that the onslaught isn't over. Peak stranding season hasn't happened yet. Historically, most sea lion strandings occur during April and May, when pups are weaned and have to find their way on their own. "We anticipate it will only get worse in the coming months," Melin said.

[Investigations into the abundance, or lack thereof, of the main food sources of sea lions might shed some light on this episode.
