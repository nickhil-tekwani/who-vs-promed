After Montgardin, La Batie-Neuve, and Chorges between [30 Jun and 8 Jul 2018], it is the turn of Theus and Ancelle [Hautes-Alpes department, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region]. Cases of anthrax have been confirmed in these 2 communes this week.

If in the first incidence only a mountain pasture on Mount Colombis was covered by the protection measure, however, in Ancelle, where several animals have been affected, it is now the whole of the municipality that is concerned. "In Theus, the vaccination only concerns [animals in] the mountain pasture because it is quite high and isolated from the rest of the town, and it was felt that there was no need to put the whole commune under compulsory vaccination," confirmed Rene Degioanni, departmental director of Social Cohesion and Population Protection (DDCSPP). In Ancelle, obligatory vaccination has now been extended to the whole commune. Sheep and cattle will have to be vaccinated against the disease.

Random contamination, puzzling authorities
------------------------------------------
This is the 10th household spotted in the Hautes-Alpes. Health services, state services and farmers are puzzled, 'it is a head-breaker!'. Unlike "classic" epizootics, the disease comes from soils. "This is the place that is contaminated and it re-contaminates the animals. When a beast is found dead, we disinfect it, we treat [the soil] where we found it, but how do we know where exactly the animal has been eating and how far it reached?" explains René Degioanni. Indeed, anthrax is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. Thanks to land movements or climate, these spores, present in the soil for sometimes several years, go back to infecting the ruminants.

"We have already vaccinated cows and are waiting for vaccines to be able to treat ewes," explains a sheep and cattle farmer in Ancelle. Once the vaccination is done it will be necessary to wait 3 weeks, the advantage is that the disease (vaccine) is preventive and curative. None of his animals have been infected and the farmer does not really express any concern about the disease that has not reappeared since the early 1980s. "The only fear is not to have the vaccines on time and the animals become infected in the meantime. And then, for the moment, no case has been detected in sheep pastures, so we will avoid contaminated pastures."

No contagion to humans
----------------------
For now, no infection to humans has been detected. This transmission is made by contact with the infected animal, by absorption of contaminated products, or by inhalation. "We put all those who have been in contact with ill or dead animals under antibiotics," says the director of the DDCSPP. The farms concerned were put under surveillance. Products from animals that may be infected have been removed from consumption. "For the milk, pasteurization is sufficient, but as a precaution, the farmers destroy the milk after pasteurization."

In areas likely to be infected "it is advisable to respect the pasture pens, not to touch the found dead animals, to keep the dogs on a leash, and not to pick wild berries and mushrooms," recommends the ARS [regional health agency].

"With the heat and the sun, the experts say that the spores die quickly once on the surface. So you have to be reactive and patient and do not panic," concludes René Degioanni.

[This is the same general area as the previous report -- 16 Jul 2018 Anthrax - France: (MO,HA) bovine, OIE 20180716.5908970 -- and the OIE website contains a map. The Hautes-Alpes outbreaks are in south east France close to the border with Italy. Hautes-Alpes is one of the original 83 departments created during the French Revolution on 4 Mar 1790. It consists of the south east of the former province of Dauphin and the north of Provence. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hautes-Alpes)

For Ancelle, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/FR/B8/Ancelle.html. For Theus, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/FR/B8/Theus.html. These 2 communes are a distance apart. Montgardin is south east of Ancelle, (http://www.fallingrain.com/world/FR/B8/Montgardin.html). Interestingly Chorges is immediately downstream of Montgardin, (http://www.fallingrain.com/world/FR/B8/Chorges.html). La Batie-Neuve has not made its way to Fallingrain yet but La Batie-Vieille (presumably related, "Old Batie") is close to Montgardin, (http://www.fallingrain.com/world/FR/B8/La_BatieVieille.html).

The advice to not pick berries or mushrooms is beyond me. Certainly don't pick mushrooms near a carcass nor berries just in case they are contaminated. But anything more than 5 metres [about 16 feet] away should be safe.

The previous OIE report was for Montgardin, but it is now revealed to have been recently diagnosed in La Batie-Neuve and Chorges, and latterly in Ancelle and Theus, for a total of 10 outbreaks in the 5 communes. Where the affected communes are adjoining one might suspect that tabanid biting flies are contributing to the problem. But for distant communes an alternative cause will have to be found. Maybe just a repeat of what initiated the index outbreak, a possible cattle grave disturbance. - Mod.MHJ
