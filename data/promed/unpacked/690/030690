A pneumonia outbreak has been detected in the city of Borodino
(Krasnoyarsk region), announced Nina Bogalej, manager of the
pediatrics department of a local hospital. In the last several days,
over 60 inhabitants of Borodino have sought medical treatment, mainly
children 2-13 years of age. Approximately half the patients had
fevers of up to 40 degrees Celsius [104 Fahrenheit].

Bogalej also said that physicians in that small city that "this viral
illness is being transmitted mainly by the aerial [aerosol? airborne?
- Mod.LM] route." She also noted that schoolmates and relatives of
those who have fallen ill previously are now seeking medical
treatment, including many adults.

Though containment measures have appreciably limited the spread of
the illness, in order to determine the source of the outbreak,
doctors in Borodino have asked the help of their colleagues in
Krasnoyarsk, who have the necessary equipment for research.

[Speculation as to the etiology of the acute respiratory illness
would include respiratory viral pathogens such as RSV, influenza,
adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus, and parainfluenza. Few clues
are given as to the clinical illness and any further information
would be appreciated. - Mod.LM]
