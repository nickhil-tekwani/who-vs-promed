Several pet food products have been recalled after 28 dogs died, the US Food and Drug Administration [FDA] announced on Wednesday [31 Dec 2021]. Three brands of Sportmix products for dogs and cats made by Midwestern Pet Foods may contain potentially fatal levels of the toxin aflatoxin, according to the FDA. The FDA said it is aware of at least 28 deaths and 8 illnesses in dogs having eaten the recalled pet food.

The Missouri Department of Agriculture tested multiple samples of the food and found "very high levels" of aflatoxin, which is produced by a mold, can grow on corn and other grains used in pet food, the FDA said.

Midwestern Pet Foods has committed to recalling 9 lots of Sportmix products, the FDA said. The FDA and Missouri Department of Agriculture are working to determine if any others need to be recalled.

The lot code, which begins with the letters "Exp," is located on the back of the bag. As of [30 Dec 2020], the recalled products are:

Sportmix Energy Plus
*50 lb. bag:
- Exp 03/02/22/05/L2
- Exp 03/02/22/05/L3
- Exp 03/03/22/05/L2
*44 lb. bag:
--Exp 03/02/22/05/L3

Sportmix Premium High Energy
*50 lb. bag:
- Exp 03/03/22/05/L3
*44 lb. bag:
- Exp 03/03/22/05/L3

Sportmix Original Cat
*31 lb. bag:
- Exp 03/03/22/05/L3
*15 lb. bag:
- Exp 03/03/22/05/L2
- Exp 03/03/22/05/L3

The products were distributed to online retailers and stores nationwide, the FDA said.

Pet owners who have the recalled products should contact the company for further instructions or throw the products out in a way children, pets, and wildlife cannot access them.

Signs of aflatoxin poisoning include sluggishness, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice, and diarrhea. There is no evidence pet owners who handle the products are at risk of aflatoxin poisoning, the FDA said.

If your pet has signs of aflatoxin poisoning, contact a veterinarian immediately.

The FDA is alerting consumers [https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/outbreaks-and-advisories/fda-alert-certain-lots-sportmix-pet-food-recalled-potentially-fatal-levels-aflatoxin] Midwestern Pet Foods, Inc. is recalling 9 lots of Sportmix pet food products because they contain potentially fatal levels of aflatoxin [https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/midwestern-pet-foods-voluntarily-recalls-pet-food-recall-aflatoxin-health-risk].

FDA is aware of at least 28 deaths and 8 illnesses in dogs that ate the recalled products.

This is an ongoing investigation. Case counts and the scope of this pending recall may expand as new information becomes available.

Lot code information may be found on the back of the bag and will appear in a 3-line code, with the top line in the format "EXP 03/03/22/05/L#/B###/HH:MM".

As new information becomes available, the product list above may continue to expand.

FDA and the Missouri Department of Agriculture are working with the firm to determine whether any additional products may have been made with the same ingredients containing potentially fatal levels of aflatoxin.

About aflatoxin
---------------
Aflatoxin is a toxin produced by the mold _Aspergillus flavus_ and at high levels, it can cause illness and death in pets. [It is important to note that you may not be able to see or smell the mold in the bag of pet food. Nevertheless, if the name, size, and expiration dates match, do not feed it to your pet, and remove any remaining food in the bowls. Purchase a different bag of food, not on the recall list, to feed your pets. - Mod.TG]

The toxin can be present even if there is no visible mold. Pets are highly susceptible to aflatoxin poisoning because, unlike people, who eat a varied diet, pets generally eat the same food continuously over extended periods of time. If a pet's food contains aflatoxin, the toxin could accumulate in the pet's system as they continue to eat the same food.

Pets with aflatoxin poisoning may experience signs such as sluggishness, loss of appetite, vomiting, jaundice (yellowish tint to the eyes, gums, or skin due to liver damage), and/or diarrhea. In some cases, this toxicity can cause long-term liver issues and/or death. Some pets suffer liver damage without showing any symptoms.

Pet owners whose pets have been eating the recalled products should contact their veterinarians, especially if they are showing signs of illness.

There is no evidence to suggest that pet owners who handle products containing aflatoxin are at risk of aflatoxin poisoning. However, pet owners should always wash their hands after handling pet food.

What to do?
-----------
Affected products may still be on store shelves, online, or in pet owners' homes. Pet owners should stop feeding their pets the recalled products listed above and consult their veterinarian, especially if the pet is showing signs of illness. The pet owner should remove the food and make sure no other animals have access to the recalled product.

US citizens can report complaints about FDA-regulated pet food products by calling the consumer complaint coordinator (https://www.fda.gov/safety/report-problem-fda/consumer-complaint-coordinators) in your area. Or go to the FDA's "Report a Pet Food Complaint" page at https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/report-problem/how-report-pet-food-complaint.

Canadians can report any health or safety incidents related to the use of this product by filling out the Consumer Product Incident Report Form at https://www.canada.ca/en/services/health/report-health-safety-concern.html.

[Signs of aflatoxicosis in dogs include:
- bloody vomiting or diarrhea
- general lethargy
- loss of appetite
- increased water consumption and urination
- jaundice or yellowing of the whites of the eyes or gums or inside of the ears, especially in cats
- In severe cases, aflatoxin can cause death.

Although aflatoxin has been associated with cancer in people, it does NOT cause cancer in dogs. Dogs do not live long enough to develop any kind of cancer associated with aflatoxin.

Dogs are sensitive to low-level long-term intake. Although the clinical signs listed above are correct, it is important to realize there are other causes of the same signs. It is important to have your pet evaluated by a veterinarian if there are signs of illness.

If you have purchased any of the food mentioned by name and expiration date, please remove and discard the food. Do not feed them this food. Please take your pet to a veterinarian for a complete check-up, including necessary blood work. - Mod.TG]
