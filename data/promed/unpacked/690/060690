<http://www.phayul.com/news/article.aspx?article=Qinghai+Bird+flu+caused+by+fish+farms%3F&id=12635>

Almost a year after the outbreak of bird flu among the wild birds near
Qinghai Lake (Tso Ngonpo) that killed tens of thousands of wild birds and
Qinghai came to be associated with a deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu, new
cases of flu among wild birds have been reported since late April 2006 near
Qinghai Lake and in Yushu county, a remote nomadic region several hundred
kilometres to the south of Qinghai Lake.
The outbreak in wild birds continues to fuel fears that migratory birds as
carriers of the deadly avian flu could lead to a global pandemic. China's
secrecy and the stonewalling of requests for information on the flu
outbreak continue to fuel speculation about the role of migratory birds in
the spread of flu. Over the past year, the spread of the flu has not been
correlated with the migratory routes and seasons of wild birds. Indeed,
some global studies have found that migratory birds are not the cause of
the current wave of bird flu outbreaks stalking large parts of the world.
Rather, outbreaks have been concentrated in the factory farms of China,
South East Asia, and elsewhere in the world. In India, the epicentre of
outbreak of bird flu took place in 18 poultry farms in and around Navapur
in Maharashtra.
Since the Qinghai Lake outbreak in 2005, outbreaks in other parts of world
have occurred along major transport routes. However, increasing evidence
suggests that commercial poultry and its products, not migratory bird
populations, are the likely vectors of avian flu.
At present, a new theory is gaining ground that the outbreak in wild birds
near Qinghai Lake may be linked to fish farms around the lake. As early as
1998, scientists cautioned that human health hazards like an influenza
pandemic could arise from the practice of bringing together fish farms with
farm livestock. Some researchers say that bird flu may be spread by using
chicken dung as feed in fish farms, a practice now routine in Asia.
According to Le Hoang Sang, deputy director of the Ho Chi Minh City's
Pasteur Institute, Chicken excrement is one of the main carriers of the
H5N1 virus, which can survive in a cool and wet environment for a month and
slightly less if in water."
In January 2006, a 9 year old boy died from bird flu in the Mekong Delta
province of Tra Vinh after he caught it while swimming in water in which
the bodies of infected poultry had been thrown. BirdLife International, a
global body for bird protection groups in more than 100 countries, is
calling for an investigation into the possibility that the fish in these
ponds, which are fed with chicken dung, may be the means by which the new
strain of avian influenza, H5N1, is being spread. It says that outbreaks of
H5N1 have occurred this year at locations in China, Romania, and Croatia
where there are fish farms.
The above theory, if proven right, puts a serious question mark over this
practice, which has been promoted actively by the UN's Food and Agriculture
Organisation (FAO). FAO have been active in the development of commercial
aquaculture, particularly in Qinghai Lake, and is said to have helped
establish an integrated livestock-fish farm near the lake in the early 1990s.
Qinghai Lake is the largest inland lake on the Tibetan Plateau and its Bird
Island attracts thousands of seasonal bird populations including
cormorants, gulls and other species that feed upon the fingerlings and
naked carp, a species endemic to the Lake and commercially fished.
Commercial fishing was first carried out in 1958, and since the late 1980s
the agricultural potential of the Qinghai Lake area was being recognized
and development encouraged, resulting in a rapidly growing livestock industry.
Due to abundance and good quality of water near Qinghai Lake, attempts at
introduction of exotic fish species are being made. Fish farming was
encouraged, both in the lake and in surrounding reservoirs, supported by
local fish feed manufacturing facilities. Only an independent investigation
into the cause of flu among wild birds will tell whether the increased
development of fisheries in and around the Qinghai Lake has caused massive
deaths in the wild birds of Qinghai Lake.

[One must doubt that pond-raised fish play any part in the evolution of
this avian virus. On the other hand, depositing poultry faeces into the
pond water would put any wildfowl swimming in those waters at a real risk
of becoming infected. Also, any infected poultry that were culled would be
replaced by more birds and the cycle would continue. Birds faeces
repeatedly trucked in for fish food would act in the same way as a constant
risk to birds flying into and out of the fish pond areas. While wild birds
would feed in these ponds, I very much doubt that they roost/sleep while
floating on them. By flying away to sleep, they then would carry the virus
to surrounding areas and pass on the infections to separate populations of
wild birds. - Mod.MHJ]

Scientific opinion on migratory birds and their possible role in the spread
of HPAI
-----------------------------------------------
Summary
A qualitative risk assessment was conducted to determine:
1) the likelihood of introduction of Asian lineage H5N1 highly pathogenic
avian influenza (HPAI) virus by migratory birds into the EU,
2) the likelihood of it becoming endemic in wild birds in the EU, and
3) the likelihood of transmission of infection to domestic poultry.
The conclusions reached included that the probability of the virus being
released into the EU varied between low and high, depending on the species
of migratory birds. A minority opinion was noted concluding that the risk
was medium across species. In the light of this risk, it was recommended to
educate poultry keepers in currently affected countries outside the EU in
relation to minimum biosecurity standards. Surveillance should be enhanced
in these countries in domestic poultry and wild birds, and vaccination
programmes should be considered for controlling the infection. Trade with
poultry and their products needs to be managed considering the risks of
spreading virus between geographical areas.
Research needs to be conducted to improve surveillance methods in poultry
and wild birds. Wild bird migration data needs to be analysed to better
understand the flyways used by the various species.
The risk of the virus becoming endemic in European wild bird populations
was considered to vary between low and high depending on species. A
minority opinion was received concluding that this risk was medium across
species. This risk could be reduced by intensifying surveillance in wild
birds within the EU, and use the data to inform biosecurity measures in
domestic birds. The behaviour of wild birds within the EU needs to be
better studied so that the dynamics of transmission within and between
species are better understood.
The final step of the risk assessment indicates that there is a negligible
risk of the virus infecting domestic poultry kept under a high biosecurity
standard and not in high poultry density areas. The risk increases to very
low if they are kept in high poultry density areas. For backyard and
free-range poultry, and any poultry not kept under high biosecurity
standards, it was concluded that the risk of introduction of Asian lineage
H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus to the flock was low to
medium. These risks emphasize the need to make better use of existing and
new migratory bird behaviour data. Passive and active surveillance for AI
in wild birds needs to be intensified. It should focus on the species
identified in this risk assessment. Biosecurity measures for poultry
holdings need to be reviewed, and research needs to be conducted to
optimise their effectiveness. Poultry holdings should not be built in the
vicinity of wetland areas. New vaccines and their use need to be researched.

[The above opinion paper was prepared by a working group chaired by a
member of the EFSA's panel on Animal Health and Welfare (AHAW), DU

357: 1-46. Recommended reading!
This paper will probably be discussed during the due FAO/OIE International
Scientific Conference on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds, Rome, 30-31 May
2006 (see
