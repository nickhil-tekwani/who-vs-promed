VEE Advisory issued for Southern states
In January 1997, the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP)
and the American Horse Council issued an infectious disease advisory for
vaccination against Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis for horses residing
in all the Southern states, particularly those bordering Mexico.
Although the disease has not reached US borders, vaccination is being
strongly encouraged to protect horses in the United States and to provide a
buffer of protection against spread of the disease.
In 1993 and 1996, substantial outbreaks of VEE were reported in the south of
Mexico. These outbreaks, coupled with a massive outbreak in Venezuela and
Colombia in 1995, prompted industry concern over the possibility that VEE
might be reintroduced into the US horse population. VEE has not been
diagnosed in the United States since 1971.

The AAEP and the American Horse Council strongly encourage practitioners to
vaccinate all horses residing in the United States that border Mexico in
order to protect against VEE and to help provide an important immunized
population. Horses traveling to Mexico, South America, or Central America
should also be vaccinated.
However, horses intended for travel or sale outside the United States may
face export restrictions by some countries if they are vaccinated for VEE.
Therefore, consideration should be given if the horse is expected to be
exported. The USDA can determine whether a country of destination has such
restrictions.
