India warns of malaria epidemic in Assam province
---------------------------------------
GUWAHATI, India - Hundreds of thousands of people are suffering from
malaria in India's northeastern Assam state, where 73 people have
died of the disease in the past 6 weeks, a health official said on
Tuesday. Officials said the disease assumed epidemic proportions
after a prolonged spell of heavy rain that created vast pools of
stagnant water and provided a breeding ground for mosquitoes, which
spread malaria. "At least 400 000 people tested positive," B.K.
Baishya, Assam's chief malaria control officer, told Reuters in
Guwahati, the state's main city.
He said health workers and volunteers were spraying insecticides
across the tea-growing and oil-rich state as part of a mosquito
elimination drive. Authorities have also supplied chloroquine tablets
to villagers to prevent more people dying of the disease. "We have
formed more than 150 rapid response teams made up of doctors, nurses,
and pathologists to take care of people affected by malaria," Baishya
said. Malaria kills about 100 people in Assam every year, while more
than 1200 people died of the disease in 1995. Last year 122 people
died of malaria in Assam.
Medical experts say there are 300-500 million cases of malaria every
year worldwide, 90 percent of them in Africa.
