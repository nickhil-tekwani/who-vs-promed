Authorities are striving to tackle Jembrana disease, an acute viral cattle disease that is common in Bali and is now affecting cattle in Jambi.

The city's Agriculture and Food Security Agency said Jembrana disease had recently caused the sudden deaths of around 20-30 cattle in the capital city of the Sumatran province, also named Jambi.

"We have continued to make efforts to prevent the disease from spreading further," the agency's animal husbandry director, Said Abubakar, said on Friday [4 Aug 2017]. He said the Jambi administration had received many reports on sudden livestock deaths from cattle breeders in the city. The breeders reported that their cattle had died suddenly, although they had been healthy.

Said explained that cattle affected by Jembrana disease usually showed several symptoms, such as shivering, a high body temperature, and hard and blood-stained feces.

"We have asked all cattle breeders to maintain the cleanliness of their cattle pens," he said. Unclean pens were one of the factors that could lead to sudden deaths in livestock, he added. Said further said that the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Agency was striving to contain the spread of Jembrana disease by supplying cattle with vitamins.

"We hope the disease will not affect the supply of cattle ahead of Idul Adha [the Islamic Day of Sacrifice]," he said.

[Jembrana disease is a bovine disease that specifically affects Bali cattle (_Bos javanicus_). Its 1st documented outbreak occurred in 1964 in the Jembrana district of Bali, Indonesia. The causal agent is named Jembrana Disease Virus (JDV), a lentivirus member of the family retroviridae.

The disease development of Jembrana disease in Bali cattle is unique for a lentivirus infection, as it is manifested by an acute course with severe clinical signs. In experimentally JDV-infected Bali cattle, the death rate was about 21 percent and occurred within 1-2 weeks post-infection, correlated to multiorgan failure.

Mortality of more than 60 000 cattle head in a year was observed during the 1st outbreak of Jembrana disease; the disease has become endemic throughout parts of Indonesia, particularly in Java, Sumatra and Kalimantan. For the location of Jambi, see map at http://tinyurl.com/y7c9kply.

Early diagnosis is essential for isolation and animal movement restrictions to prevent spread within and between holdings. Jembrana disease can be diagnosed by the clinical symptoms, but more reliable diagnostic tools are available, based on either antigen (immuno-diagnosis) or viral genome (molecular diagnosis).

The main clinical symptoms in Bali cattle include elevated body rectal temperature, lethargy, anorexia, diarrhea with blood in feces, pallor of the mucus membrane, swelling of the superficial lymph nodes during the febrile phase, with high titer of infectious virus in blood and secreted fluids (milk, saliva). In experimental infections, a study showed that JDV had the capability to infect other types of cattle, including the most prevalent farmed cattle, such as Ongole cattle (_Bos indicus_) and Friesian cattle (_Bos taurus_), buffaloes (_Bubalus bubalis_), sheep, goats and pigs. However, it was hard to establish the clinical diagnosis in other cattle breeds and in other species infected by JDV, since they only develop a mild febrile response without clear signs of disease.

The impact of Jembrana disease upon Indonesia's economy is underlined by the fact that the JDV-susceptible Bali cattle comprise about 27 percent of the total cattle population of Indonesia, being a major component of Indonesia's beef industry.
