_Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ found in the Netherlands
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In December 2007, the presence of _Clavibacter michiganensis_ subsp.
_michiganensis_ (EPPO A2 List) was suspected on tomatoes
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_ cv. Bizarr) grown at one propagation
company and 4 fruit producing companies in the Netherlands. The
identity of the pathogen was then confirmed by using the EPPO
diagnostic protocol with an improved purification method. This
outbreak is not linked to the previous one reported in April 2007
(see EPPO RS 2007/090). The possible source of infection is still
being investigated, but is most likely related to contaminated seeds
of the cultivar 'Bizarr,' which have been produced in Bolivia. As the
outbreak was detected at an early stage, phytosanitary measures were
taken immediately to eradicate the disease.

caused by _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _syringae_ on tomato in Italy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the spring of 2006 and 2007, grafted and nongrafted tomato plants
(scion cv. Cuore di Bue, rootstock _Lycopersicon lycopersicum_ x _L.
hirsutum_ cv. Beaufort) displaying stem and petiole necrosis were
observed in many commercial greenhouses in the Piedmont of northern
Italy. Initial symptoms that developed 2 to 10 days after
transplanting consisted of water-soaked circular lesions (2 to 3 mm
in diameter) on stems and petioles. These lesions eventually
coalesced into brown-to-black areas as much as one cm in diameter. In
some cases, necrotic areas progressed from stem petioles to leaf
tissues. Thereafter, plants wilted and died within a few days. In
some greenhouses, more than 80 percent of young plants exhibited
symptoms and production was severely reduced.

Tests were performed on 2 to 3 sections of symptomatic tissue from
stems and petioles from 20 affected plants. _Pseudomonas_ spp. were
consistently isolated identified by biochemical and biological
assays. The isolates also caused severe necrotic lesions on lemon
fruits and lilac leaves. The bacteria were identified as _Pseudomonas
syringae_ pv. _syringae_. Also, repetitive-sequence PCR [polymerase
chain reaction] indicated that the isolates belong to pattern 4 of
_P. syringae_ pv. _syringae_.

The pathogenicity of 3 isolates was tested twice by spraying
35-day-old healthy tomato plants (cv. Cuore di Bue) with inoculum.
Ten grafted and 10 nongrafted plants were inoculated. Six days
post-inoculation, stem lesions, similar to those seen in the field,
and leaf spots were observed on all bacteria-inoculated plants, but
not on the controls. Leaf tissues did not develop symptoms.
Isolations were made from the lesion margins and the resulting
bacterial colonies were again identified as _P. syringae_ pv.
_syringae_.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of syringae leaf spot [in
tomato] caused by _P. syringae_ pv. _syringae_ in Italy as well as in
Europe [but see comment below]. A bacterial spot of tomato caused by
_P. syringae_ pv. _syringae_ has been reported in the United States.

[_C. michiganensis_ subsp. _michiganensis_ (CMM) causes bacterial
canker on field and glasshouse tomatoes resulting in up to 70 percent
yield loss. Its host range also includes a number of wild relatives
of tomato and solanaceous weeds, which may serve as pathogen
reservoirs. The bacterium was first described in North America and
has since also been found in various locations worldwide. This wide
distribution accounts for a high risk of new incursions, as
demonstrated by the situation in the Netherlands.

Symptoms on tomato include wilting and/or desiccation, necrotic
lesions with resulting cankers on the stems, and discolouration and
degeneration of vascular tissues. Fruits may fail to develop or drop
prematurely and may develop bleaching or spotting. The pathogen is
spread by water, mechanical means during cultivation, and is seed
transmitted at a rate of around one percent. Seedlings from
contaminated seed appear healthy, symptoms appear only as plants
approach maturity. The bacterium survives for a long time in plant
debris and on equipment and remains viable for at least 8 months in
seeds. Disease management relies on the use of clean seed (certified
or treated), plant hygiene measures and elimination of sources of
inoculum. Resistance germplasm is available but has not yet been
incorporated to any significant degree into commercial cultivars.

The genus also includes a number of other plant pathogenic species,
for example potato ring rot is caused by _C. m._ subsp.
_sepedonicus_, and ratoon stunt of sugarcane is caused by _C. xyli_
subsp. _xyli_.

Both _Pseudomonas syringae_ pv. _syringae_ (PSS) and the closely
related _P. s._ pv. _tomato_ can cause leaf-speckling diseases on
tomato and can also infect capsicum. When both pathogens are present,
they do not appear to counteract each other. PSS has been reported
previously in Italy (Buonaurio & Scortichini, 1994, Plant Pathology
43, 216-9) and the USA on capsicum seedlings. While these plants
frequently recovered and economic losses were not incurred, the
disease caused on tomato is apparently much more serious with
symptoms as described above. PSS is a common epiphyte on both leaves
and seeds of many plants. Seed transmission is suspected for PSS in
both tomato and capsicum. PSS is also known to cause diseases of
citrus, stone fruit, and mango. A more serious soft rot of capsicum
is reported to be caused by _P. s._ pv. _capsici_. Additional
pathovars are known that can affect other crops, for example
soybeans, beans, and mulberries.

The current scientific name for tomato is _Solanum lycopersicum_,
however a number of synonyms and previous names are still in use as
well (see link below).
