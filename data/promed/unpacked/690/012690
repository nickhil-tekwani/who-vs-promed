PLAGUE, PNEUMONIC - CHINA (05): (QINGHAI) COMMENT

I've been following this plague in China business with the greatest
interest. No one has pointed out in ProMed that all the research done
by ex-Soviet scientists on marmot plague indicates that it has a
pneumotropism (though I do not know if anyone has demonstrated it on
a molecular level.)

There were 3 huge outbreaks of pneumonic plague in the 20th Century:
60 000 dead in 1910, 16 000 in 1916 in Shanxi, China, in 1915-16, and
10 000 in 1920, with Wu Lien-teh literally sitting right on top of it
(he treated the index case) but the thing exploded anyway, because
people fled. Of the 3 outbreaks there were 3 survivors, acording to
Wu. I was surprised that this time the index case got the plague from
a dog, but I knew marmots had to be involved somehow. They are the
only creatures besides humans who can pass pneumonic plague from one
to another under normal (not laboratory) circumstances. Of course
they live in big colonies and they just keep passing it around; the
germ survives in their burrows either inside protozoa or in a biofilm
so it's impossible to eradicate, as the Soviets found when they tried
killing off the marmots.

It is such a shame the people keep fleeing, as the disease can be
treated now. I hope we don't have a major outbreak, since that's
exactly what happened in 1920 at the very least; people just escaped
from quarantine and spread the disease all over Manchuria via the
railroad tracks. I think a lot of the common wisdom about
transmissibility doesn't apply to marmot plague -- the disease really
can't be compared to what we see in this country, where it almost
never goes pneumonic except if someone skins a coyote or gets it from
their pet cat (and then, since 1924, it has never spread.) Prairie
dog plague seems to lack the pneumotropism; prairie dogs spread it
through their fleas, according to prairie dog expert John Hoogland.
But no one ever saw a flea on any human being during the Manchurian
plagues, and those scientists looked! Rats also were never involved.
After the 1st person was infected by exposure to a marmot, it was all
spread via direct contagion. So it's hard to believe that rats and
fleas were involved this time, and I wonder why the government is
apparently killing them.
