Update number 297 (based on data up to 20 Aug 2017)
--------------------------------
Summary
-------
In the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere and in some countries of South and South East Asia, high levels of influenza activity continued to be reported. In Central America and the Caribbean, influenza activity continued to be reported in a few countries. Influenza activity remained at low levels in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere. Worldwide, influenza A(H3N2) viruses are predominating.

In temperate South America, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity decreased in most of the sub-region, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominating.

In Southern Africa, influenza activity appeared to have plateaued in South Africa, with influenza A(H3N2) viruses predominantly detected.

In Oceania, seasonal influenza activity continued to increase, with influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses present in the region.

In tropical South America, influenza and other respiratory virus activity remained low.

In the Caribbean and Central American countries, respiratory illness indicators and influenza activity remained low in general, but respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity was increasing.

In Southern Asia, increased influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus detections were reported in India. Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) and influenza like illness (ILI) indicators remained high in Bhutan.

In South East Asia, increased influenza activity was reported in recent weeks, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the region.

In East and Western Asia, influenza activity remained low in general.

In Western Africa, influenza activity continued to be reported, with all seasonal influenza subtypes present in the region. Few influenza detections were reported in Eastern Africa.

In Northern Africa, no influenza virus detections were reported.

In Central Asia, there were no updated reports on virus detections or respiratory illness indicators.

In Europe and North America, little to no influenza activity was reported.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 64 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the period from 7-20 Aug 2017 (data as of 2017-09-01 04:28:36 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 48522 specimens during that period. 7438 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 6637 (89.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 801 (10.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 746 (14 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 4586 (86 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 99 (53.8 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 85 (46.2 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

[The southern hemisphere continues to report high influenza activity, while most of northern hemisphere except some parts of south Asia (India, Bhutan) have reported little or no activity thus far, which is a fairly consistent pattern. Influenza A/H3N2 viruses have been predominant globally. However, there have been recent reports of high numbers of cases and deaths associated with influenza A/H1N1pdm09 from various states of India [ProMED SoAs posts: Influenza (63): India, H1N1, update 20170904.5293172; Influenza (62): India (Rajasthan) H1N1, increased incidence, fatal 20170901.5289510], which require detailed investigation, particularly with reference to any new mutations in the virus that may render it a mismatch to the vaccine strain. - Mod.UBA]
