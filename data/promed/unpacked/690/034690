Legionnaires' disease associated with Paris in June - update 1
Nine men who developed legionnaires' disease between 11 and 20 June 1998
were in Paris in the two to ten days before becoming ill. Four of the cases
are from Scotland, three from England, one from Denmark, and one from
Sweden. The cases have been reported to the European Surveillance Scheme
for Travel Associated Legionnaires' Disease of the European Working Group
for _Legionella_ Infections (EWGLI).
The Reseau National de Sante Publique (RNSP) has identified 11 cases of
legionnaires' disease in residents of France who live in or travelled to
the Ile de France region (Paris and surrounding districts) and became ill
in June. They are not clustered by residence and are being followed up to
see if they have links with the cases reported to EWGLI. Local
investigations have shown that five of the EWGLI cases had stayed in a
particular area of Paris. Several of the French cases who have been
interviewed had travelled to the same and neighbouring areas, where cooling
towers and other potential sources of infection are being checked.
Two cases were identified by culture of a respiratory specimen, one in
England and one in France (a Scottish case admitted to hospital in St
Etienne). Isolates from these cases are being exchanged and subtyped at the
national _Legionella_ reference laboratories in Colindale and Lyons, as
part of the European scheme for standardisation of typing methods for
clinical isolates of _Legionella_.
The PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC), which coordinates
the European surveillance scheme on behalf of EWGLI, has received anecdotal
reports of several men from the United Kingdom and elsewhere who were
treated with antibiotics for severe respiratory diseases after staying in
Paris during June but not tested for legionnaires' disease.
The Respiratory Diseases Section of CDSC would be grateful for information
about confirmed and suspected cases of _Legionella_ infection associated
with travel to Paris since the beginning of June (tel 0181 200 6868 ext
4497/4481/4014 or fax 0181 200 7868 or e-mail: respcdsc@phls.co.uk).
