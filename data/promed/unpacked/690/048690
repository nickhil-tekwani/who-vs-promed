[1] 'Double mutation' variants
Date: Wed 24 Mar 2021

While several part of the world, including in India, have been dealing with new waves of the coronavirus, one of the big challenges have also been new strains. The government on [Wed 24 Mar 2021] announced that a new coronavirus variant has been detected in India.

This comes amid a new surge of COVID-19 cases across several states in the country. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG), a grouping of 10 national laboratories that was established by Ministry of Health and Family Welfares, found the variant while carrying out genomic sequencing and analysis of circulating COVID-19 viruses.

The INSACOG said that it found an increase in samples with E484Q and L452R mutations -- a double mutant variant. This means 2 mutations coming together in the same variant creating a new one. Both the E484Q and L452R mutations have been detected earlier, but the 'double mutant variant' is novel to India.

The E484Q has been detected in 11 countries earlier including US, UK, Denmark, and Switzerland. The L452R mutation has also been detected previously in 22 countries including New Zealand, Sweden, Australia.

The new variant has been categorised as a 'variant of concern' or VOC. The new 'double mutant variant' and 771 VOCs were found in samples collected from 18 states across the country.

Hindustan Times quoted the National Centre for Disease Control's director Dr. Sujeet Kumar Singh as saying, "We have seen this double mutant E484Q and L452R. This is the double mutant which has been observed in 206 samples in Maharashtra and then in a varied number in Delhi, 9 samples, and so on." He also said the variant was seen in samples from Nagpur.

While the new Indian variant of the COVID-19 virus has been detected, the experts have said there was not enough evidence or numbers to show that this was behind the latest rise in COVID-19 cases in India.

The INSACOG tested a total of 10 787 positive samples from states and union territories among which 771 VOCs were found. Data shared by the government showed that among the samples, 736 were positive for the UK variant, 34 for the South African variant, and one for the Brazilian variant.

Experts have suggested a public health response of "increased testing, comprehensive tracking of close contacts, prompt isolation of positive cases and contacts, as well as treatment as per National Treatment Protocol" by the states/UTs as standard procedure to tackle the situation.

[Such [double] mutations could potentially confer immune escape and increased infectivity.

Are double mutants more worrisome? Does this mean that there may be an ongoing emergence of separate lineage developing in India with the L452R and E484Q mutations?

That is not so surprising. Viruses mutate all the time, but there are questions that need answering: Does the presence of this double mutation change how the virus behaves? Will this variant be more infectious now, or cause more severe disease? And importantly, will current vaccines still work well against it? The proportion of tests that have shown this double mutation is currently low, with nothing to suggest this is the cause behind the current surge in cases. However, even though this double mutation means a possible new VOC, the situation requires the same public health response. Increased testing, tracking of close contacts, the prompt isolation of cases, as well as masks and social distancing.

As for the vaccines, so far, for many variants of concern around the world, they have been shown to be effective, though sometimes less so when compared to the original viruses they were designed against. Scientists are confident that, if needed, existing vaccines can be modified to target new mutations. - Mod.UBA]

[2] AstraZeneca vaccine trial results
[2a]
Date: Tue 23 Mar 2021, updated 25 Mar 2021 7:13 a.m. ET

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/23/business/astrazeneca-vaccine-questions.html


Only hours after AstraZeneca announced encouraging news about the effectiveness of its COVID-19 vaccine on Monday [22 Mar 2021], a group of medical experts charged with monitoring the company's clinical trial made a highly unusual accusation: AstraZeneca had essentially cherry-picked data to make its vaccine look better.

The accusation, in a one-page letter sent Monday [22 Mar 2021] to the company and federal officials, was a fresh blow to the credibility of a vaccine whose low price and relatively easy storage have made it critical to the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic.

The private letter, which was described by people who have read it, castigated AstraZeneca for jeopardizing the integrity of a closely watched clinical trial.

"Decisions like this are what erode public trust in the scientific process," the oversight board wrote.

The letter prompted the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases to issue a sharply worded statement on Tuesday [23 Mar 2021] shortly after midnight, disclosing the panel's concerns.

The fight is about the degree of effectiveness of a vaccine that is undisputably effective.

While AstraZeneca said on Monday [22 Mar 2021] that its vaccine appeared to be 79% effective at preventing COVID-19, the panel of independent experts said the actual number may have been between 69% and 74%. The mass availability of a vaccine with even a 69% efficacy rate could help the world conquer the coronavirus.

But the public airing of a conflict between a pharmaceutical company and a board overseeing a clinical trial is almost unheard of. It is certain to trigger extra scrutiny of the vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration and other regulators if, as expected, AstraZeneca seeks their authorization to use it on an emergency basis in the United States.

Repeated problems with the data presented by AstraZeneca have shattered the confidence of American regulators and threaten to cast a worldwide cloud over the company's vaccine.

"Any type of thing like this could, unfortunately, contribute to a lack of confidence in the process," said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading infectious-disease expert.

Fears that the vaccine might trigger rare but serious side effects had led more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, to temporarily suspend the use of the shot. European regulators last week affirmed the vaccine's safety. The results from the US trial on Monday [22 Mar 2021] -- providing the cleanest, most complete picture of the vaccine's efficacy -- seemed to validate the vaccine's safety and made it look more effective than in earlier trials.

In short, it bolstered the credibility of arguably the world's most important vaccine, one that has been authorized for use in more than 70 countries. But the overnight announcement from the institute immediately raised a new set of questions about it and AstraZeneca.

"If they keep making these unforced errors, then that's going to derail confidence, and that will really affect our ability to combat this pandemic," said Dr. Peter J. Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine.

At issue is whether to count, in the public release of data, more recently confirmed cases of COVID-19 among participants. The oversight board pushed AstraZeneca representatives last week to go through a backlog of potential cases and classify whether they were or were not COVID-19. That had the potential to affect the vaccine's effectiveness rate, for better or worse.

The requested analysis showed that the vaccine was between 69% and 74% effective, according to the oversight board's letter. But when AstraZeneca unveiled its interim results on Monday [22 Mar 2021], the company did not count those newly classified COVID-19 cases. As a result, it reported that the vaccine appeared to be 79% effective at preventing the disease.

Until they received the monitoring board's letter, AstraZeneca executives weren't aware that the panel expected them to include the updated figures in their news release, according to a person familiar with the executives' thinking.

Federal officials, however, were stunned to discover on Monday [22 Mar 2021] that AstraZeneca had released those results even though the monitoring board had spent days pushing for -- and eventually received -- updated data. By then, Dr. Fauci had publicly hailed the results at a White House briefing, and the company had been showered with positive media coverage. AstraZeneca's shares rose about 4% on Monday [22 Mar 2021].

AstraZeneca on Tuesday [23 Mar 2021] defended its actions, saying the interim results appeared to be "consistent" with more recent data collected during the trial. The company said it would immediately share its latest data with the monitoring board and reissue fuller results within 48 hours.

The company's shares fell 3.5% on Tuesday [23 Mar 2021].

Dr. H. Cody Meissner, an infectious-disease expert at Tufts University School of Medicine, said he had never before seen such a sequence of events with a vaccine developer. "You know the anti-vaccine community is going to use this as fodder to argue that pharmaceutical companies are always deceptive," he said.

Dr. Meissner, who serves on a board that advises the FDA on whether to approve vaccines, predicted that if AstraZeneca sought such authorization, board members would be even more careful than usual to scrutinize its hundreds of pages of data.

Dr. Eric Topol, a clinical trials expert at Scripps Research in San Diego, said it was "highly irregular" to see such a public display of friction between a monitoring board and a pharmaceutical company.

AstraZeneca's relationship with the US authorities has been fraught almost since it began its clinical trial here last summer. Senior health officials complained that the company was not being forthright about the design of its clinical trials, its results, and safety issues.

Last week, an apparent delay in the release of the vaccine's interim trial results raised fresh suspicions among federal officials.

In response to questions from the New York Times, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman, whom the company refused to name, said on Friday [19 Mar 2021] that any back and forth between the company and the monitoring board was simply run-of-the-mill dialogue.

With more than 32 000 participants, the US trial, which received funding from the National Institutes of Health, was the largest test of its kind for the shot. The results that AstraZeneca released on Monday [22 Mar 2021] reflected an interim look at the data after 141 COVID-19 cases turned up among volunteers, 1/3 of whom had received a saline placebo. That was enough cases to evaluate whether the vaccine was effective at preventing the disease.

The implications of the trial extend beyond the United States, which has ordered 300 million doses of the vaccine.

AstraZeneca's application for emergency authorization may take more time to review than those from the companies that have already won clearance. If there is not an obvious need for the vaccine in the United States by the time the FDA evaluates it, regulators may feel less urgency to complete their review.

The results on Monday [22 Mar 2021] had the potential to ease concerns in Europe and other parts of the world that are counting on hundreds of millions of affordable, durable doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Regulators in Europe said last week that the shot was "safe and effective," having conducted a review after a small number of people who had recently been inoculated developed blood clots and abnormal bleeding. The US trial did not turn up any sign of such problems.

Many millions of people have received the AstraZeneca shot worldwide, including more than 17 million in Britain and the European Union, almost all without serious side effects. In an effort to increase public confidence, many European political leaders have gotten the injections in recent days. The AstraZeneca vaccine has also been administered in the past week to leaders in South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand.

Even if AstraZeneca persuades American regulators to authorize its vaccine, it is not clear whether the Biden administration will deploy it here. By the end of May [2021], federal officials have said, the 3 already authorized sets of manufacturers -- Pfizer and BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson -- will have supplied enough doses to cover all American adults.

The dust-up over the US data is the latest in a series of miscues and communication blunders by AstraZeneca, whose vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, was once a front-runner in the race for a safe and effective inoculation.

In September [2020], key federal officials, including the FDA's commissioner at the time, Dr. Stephen Hahn, learned only from the news media that trials of the vaccine were halted globally after a volunteer in Britain developed worrisome neurological symptoms. AstraZeneca officials had been on a conference call with the FDA just a few hours before the news broke, but they neglected to mention the safety issue.

The US trial was paused for nearly 7 weeks last fall, in part because AstraZeneca was slow to provide the FDA with evidence that the vaccine had not caused the neurological symptoms. Investigators concluded that the symptoms could not be linked to the vaccine.

Still, the delay left AstraZeneca trailing the 3 authorized manufacturers.

https://www.statnews.com/2021/03/24/pushing-back-against-u-s-health-officials-astrazeneca-says-new-analysis-confirms-efficacy-of-its-covid-19-vaccine/


Rejecting sharp criticism from US government scientists, AstraZeneca said Wednesday [24 Mar 2021] night that its COVID-19 vaccine was 76% effective at reducing the risk of symptomatic COVID-19, and 100% effective against severe disease, in a new analysis of its large US-based clinical trial.

Those estimates were just a few percentage points lower than much more sparse results the company released Monday [22 Mar 2021] from an earlier analysis of the study, despite dramatic statements from government scientists that AstraZeneca's initial release may have used "outdated information" that could have been overly favorable.

AstraZeneca said Monday [22 Mar 2021] that the vaccine was 79% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 based on 141 cases of COVID-19 that occurred in the 32 000-patient study, which was conducted with the National Institutes of Health. That would appear very similar to the results in the updated analysis, which is based on 190 cases from the trial. There are still 14 possible or probable COVID-19 cases that researchers want to double-check before including, but those would be unlikely to substantially change the final results.

The new company data come after considerable drama, when the government agency that helped run the trial challenged AstraZeneca's credibility. Early Tuesday [23 Mar 2021], the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a part of the NIH, issued a statement saying that the earlier figures may have been based on "incomplete information."

The data and safety monitoring board for the trial, a key committee charged with overseeing patient safety and trial integrity, had written a harsh letter to AstraZeneca and copied the leadership of NIAID and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, another part of the US government. NIAID decided to make the clash public, and its head, Anthony Fauci, characterized AstraZeneca's Monday [22 Mar 2021] release as "an unforced error."

STAT reached out to Fauci Wednesday [24 Mar 2021] night, but he did not immediately reply.

Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, said that the results were "better than expected" given the clash between the DSMB and AstraZeneca. He added that he is "relieved since the world needs the vaccine badly."

AstraZeneca did not detail its conversations with the DSMB about its latest analysis, saying only, "These results have been presented to the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board." A company spokesperson would not explain what that sentence meant but said that the press release was shared with the DSMB, and the primary analysis is prespecified.

The primary endpoint, vaccine efficacy at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, was 76% for infections occurring 15 days or more after receiving 2 doses given 4 weeks apart. Results were similar in different age groups, with vaccine efficacy of 85% in adults 65 years and older.

In preventing severe or critical disease and hospitalization, the vaccine demonstrated 100% efficacy. There were 8 cases of severe COVID-19 observed in that analysis, with all of those cases in the placebo group.

That number of cases is more than it sounds, because 2/3 of the patients received vaccine, and only 1/3 placebo, but 8 is still a small number of cases upon which to draw a firm conclusion about how protective the vaccine is against severe disease. Moderna, the developer of another COVID-19 vaccine, had 30 cases of severe disease in its study.

Based on a statistical measure called confidence intervals given in the press release, the end result on overall efficacy could be anywhere between 68% and 82%, figures that would more than pass the Food and Drug Administration's criteria for an emergency use authorization. AstraZeneca said it would file for such an authorization in the coming weeks.

All the results look more robust than data from an earlier pooled analysis of clinical trials in the UK, South Africa, and Brazil, which showed a roughly 62% efficacy for the vaccine.

After all the twists and turns, though, several researchers reached by STAT said they would prefer to wait until more results are available before drawing firm conclusions. AstraZeneca has said it would publish the results in a peer-reviewed medical journal. In deciding whether to grant an authorization, the FDA will rely not on AstraZeneca's estimates but on its own analysis of the raw data.

Or, as Nahid Bhadelia, the director of the special pathogens unit at Boston Medical Center, put it on Twitter: "At this point, I will wait for the FDA submission packet just to avoid any further roller coaster rides."

[These reports provide some additional clarity on the concerns raised by the Data Safety Monitoring Board in the AZ trial. It appears that there is/was disagreement as to assignment of COVID-19 cases that occurred more recently (i.e., later in the study). It is unusual for the DSMB to publicly disagree with the study sponsor and is likely to lead to greater scrutiny by FDA and skepticism from the general public. The unfortunate tendency of using press releases to disseminate study data can lead to incomplete and sometimes overly optimistic interpretations of outcomes. In fact, the revised summary data released by AZ shows less efficacy than originally stated and is in line with the DSMB statement. ProMED awaits the formal report of study data to the FDA, and we are certain that FDA and others will scrutinize the data closely. Unfortunately, this series of events will not promote confidence in the vaccine or in vaccines more generally. - Mod.LM]
