Maybe the green onions were not the culprit after all. As the number of
confirmed or suspected cases of _Escherichia coli_ infection rose to 400
yesterday, 11 Dec 2006, federal officials said that their testing had
failed to confirm preliminary findings by Taco Bell that some green onions
in its restaurants were contaminated. The chain removed green onions from
its restaurants last week.
"There's nothing to implicate green onions right now," said Dr David
Acheson, chief medical officer for food safety at the Food and Drug
Administration. "We have not ruled out any food ingredient. We haven't
ruled any in, and we haven't ruled any out, and that includes green onions."
At the same time, the New York State Health Department retracted last
week's announcement that its more sophisticated tests of green onions from
a Taco Bell on Long Island had found the virulent strain, _E. coli_
O157:H7, believed to have sickened more than 300 people in New York.
Instead, the agency said that that sample was actually white onions that
had been mislabeled, and the strain of _E. coli_ found was not the same as
the one that had caused illness. Health officials in New Jersey also said
yesterday, 11 Dec 2006, that their testing had not found contamination in
green onions, though the samples examined had been shipped several days
after the outbreak began in November 2006.
Taco Bell issued a statement last night [11 Dec 2006] saying that while its
initial green onion tests were "presumptively positive" for _E. coli_, its
further testing, like the FDA's, was negative. Additional testing of more
than 300 other samples of food also was negative, the company said. As a
precaution, Taco Bell said it had switched to a new produce supplier for
the affected states.
Dr Acheson said in a joint news conference with the officials from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that both federal agencies
would continue their investigation "to determine what went wrong and where
it wrong."
So far, New York has reported 311 confirmed or suspected cases of _E. coli_
O157:H7, including 233 on Long Island. New Jersey has reported 73 cases,
Pennsylvania 11, and Delaware 4. Also, a South Carolina resident who became
ill had eaten at a Taco Bell in Pennsylvania. A suspected case in Utah
turned out to be unconnected to this outbreak.
Officials said that although the total number of confirmed cases continued
to rise because of belated reports of illnesses, there were no new
infections. "So that's good news," said Dr Christopher Braden of CDC. But
he cautioned, "We're not ready to say it's absolutely over."

This outbreak was clearly linked to Taco Bell restaurants in the north
eastern United States. As of 12 PM (ET) Tue 12 Dec 2006, 67 persons with
illness associated with the Taco Bell restaurant outbreak have been
reported to CDC from 5 states: New Jersey (30), New York (22), Pennsylvania
(12), Delaware (2), and South Carolina (1). States with Taco Bell
restaurants where persons confirmed to have the outbreak strain have eaten
are New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Delaware (The patient from
South Carolina ate at a Taco Bell restaurant in Pennsylvania). Other cases
of illness are under investigation by state public health officials.
Among these 67 ill persons, 51 (76 per cent) were hospitalized and 8 (12
per cent) developed a type of kidney failure called hemolytic-uremic
syndrome (HUS). Illness onset dates have ranged from 20 Nov to 5 Dec 2006.
The peak of the outbreak was in the last week of November 2006; the number
of new cases being identified has declined substantially.
Cases in 47 of the 67 patients are confirmed, meaning that the patients'
_E. coli_ O157 strains have the outbreak DNA fingerprint. _E. coli_ O157
strains are routinely DNA fingerprinted at public health laboratories in
all states as part of PulseNet (the network of public health laboratories
that subtype bacteria). _E. coli_ O157 strains from other cases are being
tested by PulseNet. As a result of testing by PulseNet, cases with the
outbreak strain's fingerprint pattern are being re-classified as confirmed
cases, and cases with an unrelated fingerprint pattern are being dropped
from the outbreak case count.
The source of the outbreak has not been determined, though it is presumed
to be a contaminated food or foods. CDC is working with state and local
health officials, the FDA, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the
restaurant chain to determine what food caused the outbreak. These
investigations include an ongoing study that involves interviews of ill and
well Taco Bell restaurant patrons about what food items they consumed. By
comparing foods consumed by ill and well persons, investigators can show
statistical links to particular food ingredients. Public health officials
are focusing on ingredients that were consumed by many ill persons and
fewer well persons. Of these ingredients, those consumed raw are of
particular interest. This analysis is also demonstrating that onions of any
type are probably not linked to this outbreak. Health officials and the
restaurant chain are working collaboratively to learn more about the
ingredients of particular interest to help pinpoint the food that caused
the outbreak and to determine how it became contaminated.
Public health laboratories are testing food samples from Taco Bell
restaurants. A sample of chopped yellow onions collected on 4 Dec 2006 from
an open bin in a Taco Bell restaurant in Nassau County, New York tested
positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7. This strain has a DNA fingerprint pattern
that is different from that of the outbreak strain; the pattern of the
chopped onion strain has not been seen before in ill persons in this
country. Samples of green onions obtained by the restaurant chain tested
negative for _E. coli_ O157; the initial report of a preliminary positive
on these samples by a laboratory hired by the restaurant chain was not
confirmed. At this time, no other food item has a definite or preliminary
test indicating the presence of _E. coli_ O157.

[The number of "outbreak" cases confirmed by DNA analysis is growing more
slowly than the number suspected to be part of the cluster. It now appears
that green onions (also known as scallions) may not be the vehicle of
transmission. - Mod.LL]
