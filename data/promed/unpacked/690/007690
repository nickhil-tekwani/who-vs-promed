Australia's apple and pear industry has welcomed the Australian Government's decision to suspend imports of nashi pears from South Korea due to an outbreak of fire blight there. The suspension until further notice follows the confirmed detection of fire blight (_Erwinia amylovora_) in Korea.

The South Korean Government notified Australia of the outbreak in accordance with its protocol requirements.

South Korea was granted access to the Australian market subject to [it] implementing phytosanitary requirements, [such as] in-field detection, monitoring surveys, disinfestation, and recognised pest/disease-free growing areas, to prevent a range of pests and diseases -- including fireblight -- reaching Australia. No pests and diseases of quarantine concern to Australia have been intercepted [so far].

[Fireblight is caused by the bacterium _Erwinia amylovora_ and is considered the most destructive disease of pome fruit trees worldwide. Many varieties of pear, quince and apple are susceptible, although the level of susceptibility may vary with cultivars. Only members of the _Rosaceae_ are affected, mainly the sub-family _Maloideae_ (synonym _Pomoideae_), but also many cultivated rose and bramble varieties. The known host range covers more than 140 species from 40 genera. Many ornamental and weed species serve as pathogen reservoirs for crop infections.

The name of the disease is derived from the symptoms of blackening of the leaves as if they were scorched by fire. Affected shoots bend forming black hooks; some fruits may show lesions; cankers appear on branches and trunks and trees invariably die. The bacteria enter the host plant through wounds and are highly infectious. They are spread by insect activity (including pollinators), wind, water (rain, irrigation), mechanical means (tools, orchard workers), and with plant material (including budwood). Importation of plant material including fruit (shipments may also contain contaminated leaf or twig fragments) from areas with endemic fireblight poses a considerable quarantine risk.

The bacteria overwinter almost exclusively in cankers on limbs infected during the previous season and, consequently, the amount of inoculum and thus the risk of outbreaks are increased following years with high fireblight levels. Phytosanitation and monitoring are used to attempt exclusion of fireblight from individual orchards. Disease management may include cultural measures (such as removal of pathogen reservoirs) and bactericidal sprays. Certain cultivar/rootstock combinations may provide some protection. Currently, the most effective control is application of streptomycin during flowering, but the use of antibiotics in agriculture is mostly subject to strict regulations.

A continued spread of _E. amylovora_ to new areas and the emergence of new streptomycin resistant strains are a major concern to pome fruit industries worldwide.

In the southern hemisphere, fireblight has so far only been reported from New Zealand. In Australia, a fireblight incursion is being regarded as a major threat (ProMED-mail post 20070625.2046, and see link below) since it would lead to enormous costs for eradication attempts as well as the loss of Australia's fireblight-free status, which would prohibit valuable exports to fireblight-free countries in Asia.
