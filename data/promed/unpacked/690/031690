A new virus has been found in cows in Nepal. Symptoms of fainting due to fever and sores on the body of the cow have been seen. According to Dr. Sanjay Yadav, head of the Animal Research Laboratory, Biratnagar, 400 cows have fallen ill in the last one month in Morang alone.

He informed that the lesions seen on the body on the previous day would spread all over the body the next day; fever up to 104-105 deg F [40.0-40.6 deg C] was recorded. He said that the problem has been seen in cattle for about a month, but the number of cases has increased during the last 2 weeks.

According to Yadav, more than 1000 cows in Jhapa, Morang, Sunsari, Saptari, and other districts have contracted the disease, and 10-12 cows have died. Yadav said that most of the cows in Nepal are affected by the disease, especially cattle and buffaloes.

In China, Bangladesh, and India, a similar problem has been seen in cows and buffaloes since last January [2020], where the disease is called lumpy skin disease [LSD]. Yadav said that it is yet to be investigated in Nepal. According to him, as there is no kit in Nepal to diagnose the disease, the kit has been ordered from abroad, and blood tests will be done as soon as the kit arrives.

Even if the mortality rate of this disease is 1-4%, it will reduce the production. Doctors say that the chances of miscarriage, low milk production, and infertility are high after getting this disease.

Dr. Arjun Aryal, a veterinarian at the Central Veterinary Hospital, Tripureshwor, Kathmandu, said that cows with symptoms similar to lumpy skin disease have been seen in cows in different parts of the country for the past few weeks. He urged the farmers to keep the sick cows separate and proceed as per the doctor's advice, as the infection spreads rapidly.

[Lumpy skin disease [LSD] was reported for the 1st time in China in August 2019, in Yili prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, close to the border with Kazakhstan's Almati province. The event was reported to the OIE, but so far, no follow-up reports have been sent. On 15 Jul 2020, China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) published the recent epidemiological data on LSD, notifying recent outbreaks in the southeastern provinces of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Anhui, and Zhejiang (http://www.xmsyj.moa.gov.cn/yqfb/202007/t20200715_6348686.htm). It may be assumed that the disease did not make a huge leap (some 3000 km / 1864 mi) from its initial location but that some additional outbreaks, probably undiagnosed, have taken place since August 2019 in various parts of China.

A spread to the south may have taken place as well, since LSD entered Bangladesh and northeastern India in late 2019. After the winter intermission, when conditions for vector activity improved, the disease has renewed its circulation in the said 2 countries. India maintains the world largest cattle population; LSD has the potential to become a serious economic and animal welfare issue there. The disease, originally restricted to sub-Saharan Africa, is currently circulating within considerable parts of Eurasia.

Confirmation of the event in Nepal and its official notification are expected. - Mod.AS
