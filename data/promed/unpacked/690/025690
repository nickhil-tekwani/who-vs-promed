A cholera outbreak in South Africa is being brought under control
after 59 people died and more than 12 000 were infected since
November 2008, the health department said on Monday [9 Mar 2009].

"We are seeing a very welcome decline in figures," said Thami
Mseleku, the department's director-general. Most of the cases were in
regions near the border with Zimbabwe, where more than 4000 people
have been killed by the disease. But officials said the outbreak in
South Africa could not be blamed entirely on Zimbabwe.

"Cholera started to develop in South Africa as a consequence of
general living conditions and unsafe water supplies," Health Minister
Barbara Hogan told a press briefing. Government also defended the
decision to shut down a makeshift refugee camp on the Zimbabwe border
housing thousands of asylum seekers, saying the conditions there were
appalling.

"The situation is totally untenable," said Water Minister Lindiwe
Hendricks. She said crowds at the municipal showgrounds often swelled
to 8000 in the evenings as farmworkers came to try and receive food
parcels meant for asylum seekers in the border town of Musina. Global
medical charity Doctors Without Borders had on denounced plans to
shut down the refugee camp.

[7] Diarrhea, fatal - Philippines (Samar)

<http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/03/09/09/diarrhea-kills-6-down-49-samar-town>


In 5 villages of Villareal town, Samar province, 6 people have died
while 49 others got sick with diarrhea. According to Roque Barbo,
rural sanitary inspector of the town, most of those who fell ill were
children and the elderly whose immune systems are not strong enough
to fight the bacterial infection. The disease affected the villages
of Igot, Macopa, Ulayan, Conant, and Tayud.

Health authorities suspect that contaminated drinking water might
have caused the spread of diarrhea in those areas. "They get their
water from an open deep well, which might have been contaminated," Barbo said.

Barangay Igot chairwoman Liliosa Brillantes urged officials to help
residents find an alternative water source.
