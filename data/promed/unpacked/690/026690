Poliovirus weekly update, 26 Jun 2019, WHO
-----------------------
New wild poliovirus reported this week:
AFP cases: 5
Environment: 0

New cVDPV poliovirus reported this week:
AFP Cases: 5
Environment: 0
Others: 3

Headlines
- 2 new cVDPV2 emergences are reported this week in DR Congo; 1 from Sankuru province and 1 from Kasai province. Sankuru province is in the centre of the country and had previously not participated in mOPV2 outbreak response campaigns. However, it is neighboring known infected provinces, where mOPV2 response continues to be implemented. Kasai had already been participating in mOPV2 outbreak campaigns, as it had already been affected by a separate cVDPV2. Currently, total 6, genetically-distinct cVDPV2 outbreaks affecting the country.
- One of the major factors that determines whether a child will receive vaccinations is the primary caregiver's receptiveness to immunization. The decision to vaccinate is a complex interplay of various socio-cultural, religious, and political factors. Read how everyday people in Pakistan are advocating for vaccinations at http://polioeradication.org/news-post/vaccine-heroes-protect-every-child/.
- Bayelsa state in the Niger Delta, Nigeria, is a riverine state with precarious transportation and rivers crisscrossing the land. Thanks to healthcare workers, community engagement, and innovations in immunization practices, Bayelsa state jumped from one of the most poor-performing states in terms of routine immunization to be the 2nd best in the country (http://polioeradication.org/news-post/braving-the-waves/).

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Afghanistan: 2 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases;
- Pakistan: 3 WPV1 cases;
- Nigeria: 1 circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) case;
- DRC: 4 cVDPV2 cases;
- Ethiopia: 3 cVDPV2 isolated from healthy community contacts.

Afghanistan
- 2 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been reported in the past week from Tirinkot district, Uruzgan province with onset of paralysis on 19 and 20 May 2019. There are 10 WPV1 cases reported in 2019 from Afghanistan. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2018 remains 21.

Pakistan
- 3 wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) cases have been confirmed: 1 each from Lakki Marwat, Torghar, and Bannu districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The cases had an onset of paralysis on 29 May 2019, 31 May 2019, and [5 Jun 2019] respectively, bringing the total number of WPV1 cases to 27. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2018 remains 33.

Nigeria
- 1 case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 has been reported in the past week in Ilorin East, Kwara state with onset of paralysis on 19 May 2019. There are 9 cVDPV2 cases reported in 2019 so far. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2018 remains 34.
- Recent confirmation of spread of 1 of the cVDPV2 outbreaks, both within Nigeria and internationally, underscores the urgent need to fill remaining vaccination gaps in the ongoing outbreak response, and to optimize the geographic extent and operational quality of mOPV2 response.

Lake Chad Basin
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the past week.
- In the Lake Chad region, cVDPV2 linked to the outbreak originating in Nigeria has been detected in Niger (one case in 2019 and 10 cases in 2018), and Cameroon (1 positive environmental sample, collected on [20 Apr 2019] in Extreme Nord.
- The risk of further cVDPV2 spread across the Lake Chad subregion remains high.

Central Africa
Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo):
- 4 cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) have been reported this week in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo): 2 in Kamonia, Kasai state and 1 each from Wembo-Nyama and Tshumbe districts in Sankuru state. The viruses were isolated from acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) cases, with onset of paralysis on [3 Apr 2019, 16 Apr 2019, 21 Apr 2019], and 6 May 2019 respectively. So far, 5 cVDPV cases have been reported in DRC in 2019. The total number of cVDPV2 cases reported in 2018 is 20. DRC is currently affected by 6 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks, in the provinces of Haut Katanga; Mongala; Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri, Sankuru, and Kasai.

Angola
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported this week in Angola.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. A full epidemiological and virological field investigation is ongoing, including to ascertain the source and origin of the isolated virus; active surveillance is being strengthened; subnational population immunity levels are being analysed; and, outbreak response is being planned.
- Given cross-border population movements, subnational immunity, and surveillance gaps, Lunda Norte province is considered at high-risk for further transmission of the isolated cVDPV2. It is critical that an emergency, preventive outbreak response now be fully implemented in the province. In absence of a timely and high-quality vaccination response, there is imminent risk of further transmission of this cVDPV2, potentially leading to a significant outbreak of paralytic polio. 2 preventive emergency outbreak response campaigns with mOPV2 are planned in Lunda Norte province, to be synchronized with campaigns in neighbouring areas of DR Congo, to interrupt any potential cross-border circulation.

Horn of Africa
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) has been reported in the Horn of Africa.
- The current outbreak is linked to an ongoing cVDPV2 outbreak detected in the Horn of Africa in 2018, with cases reported in Somalia as well as from an environmental sample in Kenya. Separately, Somalia is also affected by a circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 3 (cVDPV3) outbreak.
- 3 cVDPV2 virus have been isolated from a contact case in Doolo/Warder, Somali State, Ethiopia, and were reported on 29 May 2019.
- Somalia has reported a total of 15 cVDPV cases (8 type 2, 6 type 3, and 1 coinfection of both type 2 and type 3) since the beginning of the outbreaks. The most recent cVDPV3 virus was from an AFP case from Runingod district, Middle Shabelle province with an onset date of paralysis on [7 Sep 2018]. Circulating VDPV2 has also been detected during 2018 in 1 environmental sample in Kenya collected on [21 Mar 2018].
- Since detection of the cVDPVs in the Horn of Africa in 2018, Ethiopia had declared the outbreaks -- together with the Ministries of Health of Kenya and Somalia -- to be a regional public health emergency and has been participating in regional outbreak response.
- Given cross-border population movements across the Horn of Africa and subnational immunity and surveillance gaps, Somali province is considered at high-risk of further transmission of this isolated cVDPV2.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are providing support as required. A full epidemiological and virological field investigation is ongoing; active surveillance is being strengthened; subnational population immunity levels are being analysed; and, outbreak response is being planned.
This event further underlines the risk of cVDPV2 across the Horn of Africa.

Papua New Guinea
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) were reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 26.
- The most recent cVDPV1 virus was isolated from an environmental sample collected in the National Capital district on [6 Nov 2018].
- A GPEI Outbreak Response Assessment reviewed the impact of current outbreak response and concluded that overall strong response had been implemented. Commending national and subnational public health authorities and health workers on their efforts, the Assessment team underscored the need on now filling any residual subnational surveillance and immunity gaps.
- The team reviewed all aspects of the response, and noted significant efforts and improvements, including on service delivery, surveillance strengthening, data analysis, cold chain/reverse cold chain refurbishment, vaccine acceptance and community engagement, health worker engagement, collaboration with neighbouring Indonesia and outreach to remote areas/communities. In particular, the group noted the strong collaboration between outbreak response and strengthening of routine immunization, including through systematic collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and highlighted that this model of working should be replicated in other outbreak settings.

Mozambique
- No case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) outbreak has been reported this week. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 1.
- In addition to the confirmed case, the same virus was also isolated from 2 healthy community contacts, reported on [10 and 17 Dec 2018].
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Indonesia
- No circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) cases were reported this week.
- In total, 3 genetically-linked circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) isolates were detected from Papua province: a cVDPV1 from an acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) case, with onset of paralysis on [27 Nov 2018], and 2 cVDPV1 isolates from healthy community contacts, collected on [24 Jan 2019] and [13 Feb 2019]. This outbreak is not linked to the cVDPV1 currently affecting neighbouring Papua New Guinea.
- The GPEI and partners are working with country counterparts to support the local public health authorities in conducting a field investigation (clinical, epidemiological and immunological) and thorough risk assessment to discuss planning and implementation of immunization and outbreak response.

Iran
- In total, 3 WPV1-positive environmental samples have been reported in 2019, all from Sistan and Balochistan province. The isolated viruses have been detected in environmental samples only, and genetic sequencing confirms they are linked to WPV1 circulating in Karachi, Pakistan.
- The Ministry of Health and local health authorities are undertaking a detailed investigation and the partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) are on standby to provide support as required. An immediate risk assessment suggests that this event has limited public health implications, given Iran's very high levels of routine immunization coverage and strong disease surveillance. However, this event further underlines the risk of international spread of WPV1 from Pakistan/Afghanistan.

[According to the global update above, in the past week there have been a total of 10 AFP (acute flaccid paralysis) cases confirmed to be due to infection with polioviruses -- 5 with a wild poliovirus (WPV) and 5 with the circulating vaccine derived polioviruses (cVDPVs). Specific countries reporting newly confirmed cases of WPV associated AFP are Afghanistan (2 cases) and Pakistan (3 cases). Of note there are an additional 5 cases that were confirmed in Pakistan yesterday, 26 Jun 2019, that will be included in next week's global update that will bring the global total of WPV1 associated AFP cases to 42. Specific countries reporting cVDPV associated AFP cases this past week include Nigeria (1 case cVDPV2), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (4 cases of cVDPV2), representing 2 new foci of cVDPV2 not previously involved. In addition there were 3 cVDPV2 isolated from healthy community contacts in Ethiopia.

A comment about the absence of positive environmental samples. Given the identification of 10 newly confirmed AFP cases associated with poliovirus infections, it is highly likely that there are positive environmental samples that were collected and are probably in the system being processed.
