Karnataka to be anthrax-free in 5 years
-----------------------------------------------------
In an effort to make Karnataka anthrax-free, the state government has been
vaccinating all its cattle, sheep, and buffalo in 2 "high-risk'' districts
against the lethal disease beginning 1 Jan 2003. Under an ambitious Rs
70-lakh programme, anthrax vaccines are being distributed at a
highly-subsidised Re 1 per dose to farmers to ensure that none of the
cattle get the disease.
"For the first time, we are vaccinating all herds in Tumkur and Kolar. In 5
years, Karnataka will be anthrax-free,'' Animal Husbandry and Veterinary
Sciences Director T. Ashwathnarayana told the Sunday Times of India. The
disease -- called 'nardi' in Kannada -- has been consistently stalking
cattle in the 2 districts bordering Bangalore (Tumkur and Kolar), killing
about 500 and affecting 20 000 in 2002.
However, it turned serious after 2 persons died in Kolar, while several
others in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh barely survived the inhalational form
of the disease. But despite the deaths and the scare of reports of alleged
anthrax powder distributed, no effort is being made to vaccinate humans
against infection. In graphic contrast to the US vaccinating all its cattle
handlers and even their military in fears of bio-terrorism, Karnataka does
not even vaccinate its veterinarians.
"We do not vaccinate people. We just give penicillin or antibiotics to
those affected,'' Ashwathnarayana maintained. Reason? "We are living with
anthrax, so our resistance to it is high. If, like the West, we try to
eliminate anthrax, any accidental outbreak will cause enormous
casualties.'' Humans in the high-risk category include not only cattle,
leather, and sheep-wool workers, but even those who eat undercooked meat
from infected animals. "If a human consumes or inhales more than 3000
anthrax bacterial spores, it will be fatal,'' Institute of Animal Health
and Veterinary Biologicals Director R.L. Srinivas Gowda said. The state has
launched pamphlet campaigns for precautions, but Ashwathnarayan admitted
that poor farmers do not bury the anthrax-felled cattle as required.
"They skin the dead animal or sell the meat, leading to spread of
infection." Gowda felt it was advisable to vaccinate at least tannery
workers. "But the vaccine itself is not available in India, though of late,
defense agencies are trying to import it fearing bio-warfare,'' he added.

[Firstly, the Karnataka authorities are to be congratulated, despite the
fact that this programme should have been initiated decades ago. Southeast
India is one of the worst anthrax-affected regions in the world. Secondly,
because of the severity of the problem it will take longer than 5 years.
Cyprus, with an equally severe problem, took about 12 years to become
anthrax-free under Kyriakus Polydoru, an outstanding Chief Veterinary
Officer. Among other actions, he initiated laws that made it a punishable
offense to fail to report livestock deaths to the local constabulary; the
Magistrates sentenced the guilty to 21 days in jail, no exceptions.
Thirdly, many of the human cases in that region have in the past come from
exposure to sick and dead sheep and goats. Fourthly, they will have to
upgrade their industrial standards and inspection, because an important
part of the problem has been the industrial processing of hides from
animals dead from anthrax at local tanneries with no controls on the
release of contaminated water from washing and soaking these hides. The
result was downstream contamination of pastures and water, quite apart from
chemical contamination.
I am not going to argue over the quoted LD50 for oral exposure, but this is
not known for humans, and only for a few species of animals. And it was
only the Soviets who vaccinated the general public to protect them. I have
always held that any human anthrax cases outside of industrial or BT/BW
exposures, are, without exception, a sign of a poor veterinary service. I
know no vets, outside of the military or research laboratories, who have
been vaccinated. Prompt early antibiotic treatment is very efficacious, but
the physicians have to be on their toes to diagnose the disease. - Mod.MHJ]
