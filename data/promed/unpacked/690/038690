Horse on biting spree beaten to death
-------------------------------------
Of late one has often heard of dogs going on a biting spree, but in
Vizag Agency area on Monday [23 May 2011], it was a horse that created
a scare and bit 5 persons. Villagers, however, showed no mercy on the
animal as they thrashed it to death with sticks and stones and hung it
to a tree.

The incident took place at Banglavalasa village near Sunkarametta, 12
km [7.5 miles] from Araku. The agitated horse began chasing people
down the village road and bit 5 persons and injured a few others. 2
villagers -- a 29-year-old and a 12-year-old -- received deep
bite-marks and were taken to a community health centre for the
anti-rabies vaccine. "We have no details about the others who were
bitten as they fled from the spot," a police official said.

Sources said the horse bit a villager and refused to let go despite
others hitting it with sticks. "It galloped across the road and caught
another one," a villager Pangi Subba Rao said. Within a span of 15
minutes, it created a scare among the public.

According to the villagers, the horse had been abandoned by its
owner, a farmer, 2 months ago after it was bitten by a stray dog.
"After the dog bite, the horse became very agitated and was not
obeying its master. So, he abandoned it," a villager said. The
villagers turned their ire on the horse and beat it with sticks. They
caught the horse and hung it from a big tree by tying a rope around
its neck.

Villagers depend on horses to transport goods in the Agency area
where the terrain is rough. In another incident at Ukkunagaram in
Visakhapatnam, 6 persons were injured when a rabid dog attacked them.
The injured were rushed to the Ukkunagaram hospital.

[Rabies virus is readily transmitted between mammals, whether they
are the same or different species. This virus is usually spread in the
saliva, when an infected animal bites another. Less often, an animal
or person is infected by contact with infectious saliva or
neurological tissues, through mucous membranes or breaks in the skin.
Rabies virus is not transmitted through intact skin. It is not clear
from this report if rabies virus infection of the affected horse has
been confirmed by laboratory diagnosis.

Contrary to the situation described previously in the Rajahmundry and
Kakinada districts of Andhra Pradesh (see ProMED archived reports in
listed below) anti-rabies vaccine has been immediately available in
the Araku and Vizag districts for treatment of victims of attack by
rabid animals. These places can be located in the map of Andhra
Pradesh at:
