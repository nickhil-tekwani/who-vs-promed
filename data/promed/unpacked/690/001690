Danish authorities have revealed that 3 people died in an _E. coli_ outbreak this past year [2021]. Imported spring onions were investigated as the source. An update by the Statens Serum Institut (SSI) revealed that from 23 Nov 2021 to 31 Dec 2021, 85 people were infected with EIEC.

Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ (EIEC) is usually associated with travel diarrhea, but the patients had not been abroad. It was previously reported that 68 people were ill in the outbreak linked to spring onions from Egypt via a Dutch supplier that were used in ready-to-eat salads.

Sick people lived all over the country, except for Nordjylland. They included 56 women and 29 men aged less than 1 to 91 years old. The median age was 52. Three deaths were linked to the outbreak, and 25 people were hospitalized. Sjaelland had the most patients with 29, Hovedstaden had 23, Midtjylland had 21, and 12 were from Syddanmark.

The Statens Serum Institut, Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fodevarestyrelsen) and DTU Food Institute found the source of infection was spring onions in salads sold in 3 different retail chains in November 2021. Interviews of patients found several of them had eaten the salads, and purchasing data showed they were bought from 15-30 Nov 2021.

Enteroinvasive _E. coli_ was isolated from 36 patients, and the remaining 47 were PCR positive for a gene specific to _Shigella_ species and EIEC. Further analysis identified 2 _E. coli_ serotypes in the outbreak: O136:H7 and O96:H19 with confirmation by whole-genome sequencing.

[EIEC is a human enteric pathogen that causes a shigellosis-like dysentery and is transmitted through contaminated food or water and person-to-person contact (1). Infections occur most commonly in developing countries (1,2). The 1971 outbreak in the United States was associated with imported cheese (3). More recently, contaminated vegetables were implicated in outbreaks in Italy in 2012 and the United Kingdom in 2014 (4,5). A 2018 outbreak investigation did not reveal the specific vehicle through which EIEC was transmitted.
