A rare bacterial disease that every pet owner should know about has surfaced in a Citrus Heights pet. Leptospirosis is spread from wild animals to pets and humans.

The disease is found in standing water and with all the rain lately, veterinarians are reminding people to vaccinate pets. All it takes is a puddle of water or an infected blade of grass to infect an animal, but Leptospirosis is preventable through vaccination.

Alarm bells are sounding after a Citrus Heights woman admitted her dog to the vet after it came down with leptospirosis.

Dr. Kelly Byam with Abel Pet Clinic said the disease is spread in the urine of infected animals. "The disease is usually found in standing water could be a reservoir or lake that could be a puddle or drop of urine on a blade of grass," Byam said.

Pet owners around Folsom Lake Tuesday were taking extra precautions. Byam said rats, mice, and raccoons can spread the disease. She said to look out for kidney disease symptoms in dogs. "Dogs will have a fever, they're going to drink a lot, pee a lot, and won't feel like eating," Byam said.

Leptospirosis is preventable, so it is a good idea to get your dog vaccinated. Humans can get it as well through cuts or abrasions.

[Leptospirosis in dogs, sometimes referred to by the short-hand, lepto in dogs, is an infectious disease caused by bacteria in the genus _Leptospira_. These bacteria can be found worldwide in soil and water. There are many strains of _Leptospira_ bacteria that can cause disease. Lepto generally enters through mucus membranes, not generally through intact skin, but it is possible.

Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, which means it can be spread from animals to people. Infection in people can cause flu-like symptoms and can cause liver or kidney disease. In the United States, most cases of human leptospirosis result from recreational activities involving water. Infection resulting from contact with an infected pet is much less common, but it is possible.

Dog parks and other areas where dogs congregate are areas of concern. Those managing the dog parks could - and perhaps should - post signs that communal water dishes will be removed and owners are responsible for bringing their own dish. A water source should be provided, but this can be used by the owners to fill their own bowl for their pet.

Vaccinations against the disease are available and owners should be encouraged to have their pet vaccinated.

Owners whose pets are diagnosed with the disease should be cautious about cleaning urine or putting their hands in the animal's mouth. Gloves work well for these activities. It is also suggested you follow your veterinarian's suggestion for treatment for your pet as well as safety for yourself.
