Understanding the potential role of animals in the emergence and spread of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) requires further investigation, analysis and study, FAO said today [9 Aug 2013]. Current evidence is not sufficient to identify the specific source, whether animal or otherwise, of the coronavirus that is causing MERS in humans.

Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that affect primarily birds and mammals. Some strains cause mild disease, while a limited number are more harmful (e.g. the severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] coronavirus). The MERS coronavirus has been shown to cause acute respiratory illness in humans. It has not yet been shown to cause disease in animals.

"It is not yet clear how people are becoming infected or where the virus might come from," stated Juan Lubroth, FAO Chief Veterinary Officer. "We do not have enough information to identify with certainty the virus's origin. Confirming the source and mechanisms of transmission and spread are key to developing ways to reduce the risks posed by this virus to humans or other countries."

A study led by the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment of the Netherlands and just published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases Journal provides some additional information [details in 20130809.1872008].

The study found antibodies for the MERS coronavirus or a similar virus in camel blood samples. The samples were taken in areas where human cases have not been reported. In some cases, the tested camels have been isolated from other camels for many years.

These antibody findings indicate that the MERS virus, or a similar coronavirus, occurs in some camels and potentially other species. However, the only way to know with any certainty whether the virus affecting humans is the same as the virus possibly affecting camels (or any other animal) is to isolate the virus in different species and compare them genetically.

To date, the MERS coronavirus has only been isolated in humans. Investigation and research in animal species must continue in order to shed light on potential animal sources. If and once identified, veterinary and public health authorities could better communicate how to prevent infection or institute specific control measures.

Authorities in the affected region are investigating the situation. FAO is in close communication with national authorities as well as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). FAO and its partners stand ready to support national and regional efforts to identify the environment and context or which animal species might serve as a reservoir and to address the virus in animals in order to protect human health, animal health and animal-related livelihoods.

FAO is urging countries to invest in efforts to better understand virus sources and mechanisms of transmission and spread. This information can be employed to help people and animals avoid exposure in order to reduce the risks.

[Prior to the desired, eventual isolation and identification of the MERS virus from animals, ideally providing the direct proof for their role as virus reservoir/source of human infection, serology could be helpful as an indirect, preliminary indication, allowing focusing further studies at selected/short-listed animal host populations. The published serological findings in camels from Oman and (at a lower rate) the Canary Islands potentially indicated geographical rather than host restriction. The serological surveillance should thus include the territories recognised as affected by MERS-CoV, particularly Saudi Arabia and -- on top of camels -- cover other potential species such as sheep, goats and cattle.

Readers are referred to OIE's Q&A on MERS-CoV (posting 20130727.1849047), which included article 6: "What about serological tests in animals?," as follows:

"Serology tests aim to detect antibodies produced by the animal against the virus and not to search for the presence of the virus itself. Often, it is difficult and sometimes impossible to distinguish antibodies to different viruses having genetic or antigenic similarities, due to what is known as serological "cross reactivity."

"Serology tests for MERS-CoV have not yet been validated in animals and may not be reliable. If these tests, which may not be sufficiently specific, are used in animals, there is a risk that false-positive results will occur, because it may not be possible to differentiate antibodies to MERS-Cov from antibodies to other coronaviruses commonly found in animals. That is why tests in animals should focus on isolating and identifying the virus itself."

The required validation of the MERS-CoV in animals (probably requiring experimental infection trials) will allow reliable serosurveillance within the relevant geographic area and animal populations. To confirm the suspected role of bats, their virological investigations deserve to be intensified within the said territories.

The support and guidance of the international (human and animal) health organisations for the above objectives are essential. - Mod.AS
