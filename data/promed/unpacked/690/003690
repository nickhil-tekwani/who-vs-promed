The 1st African swine fever [ASF] outbreak in the Smolensk region has occurred on the premises of the Taiga hunting and fishing society in the Sychyovka district, the Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] department for the Bryansk and Smolensk regions said on Thursday [13 Jun 2013].

"African swine virus was detected in samples taken from 2 dead boars on 11 Jun 2013. The boar carcasses were burned and the area was disinfected. The source of the infection is being traced," the department said.

Meanwhile, the Smolensk regional agriculture and food department reminded Interfax about a 3-year regional target program, "Prevention of the Occurrence and Spread of African Swine Fever", adopted in February 2013. The program implies the eventual closure of pig farms in the region. "The program budget will amount to 120 million rubles [about USD 3.8 million], including 30 million rubles [about USD 938 000] assigned from the regional budget. The subsidies will be paid to farmers and sole proprietors who breed pigs to compensate for their shift to alternative businesses [cattle, sheep, and goat breeding]," the department said.

The danger of the lethal African swine virus spreading into the Smolensk region caused the decision to close down pig farms, he said. "There is no vaccine against African swine fever and the only way to combat the disease is to kill all the pigs in an area, disinfect the land and put it under quarantine," the source said. More than 128 000 pigs are being kept in the Smolensk region.

[Russia's formal report on the event above, involving 2 wild boars (_Sus scrofa_) in the Smolensk oblast, as well as 16 new ASF outbreaks in domestic swine in the oblasts Voronezh (14 outbreaks) and Volgograd (2 outbreaks), was submitted to the OIE on Tue 18 Jun 2013. See at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=13631. The said follow-up report (no 98) includes an interactive map showing the 17 new outbreaks.

Since the start of the last ASF epizootic in Russia, on 25 Sep 2009, a total of 260 outbreaks have been reported, spread over the entire western parts of the country. A summarising map is available at the bottom of the report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013631_20130618_163110.pdf. The current case in Smolensk is the 1st one. According to the OIE map, a single ASF outbreak was recorded in the Voronezh oblast in the past.

According to a press release of Rosselkhoznadzor, Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, a working meeting was held in Paris on 30 May 2013 between Sergey Dankvert, Head of Rosselkhoznadzor and Bernard Vallat, OIE Director General. Among the issues discussed, ASF was included. The Russian website claims (in English) that "Barnard Vallat emphasized the fact that the ASF outbreak, which covered the Transcaucasia and the European part of Russia started after the abolition of the border veterinary control in Georgia. He noted that according to some data Belarus may face the same problem". For the full report, see http://www.fsvps.ru/fsvps/news/6693.html?_language=en. - Mod.AS
