"Mad fish disease" in new Ulster outbreak
-----------------------------------------
A second outbreak of infectious pancreatic necrosis, known as "mad fish
disease", has been detected in Northern Ireland. Today the Ulster Angling
Federation warned that the killer virus could have disastrous consequences
for wild salmon stocks. The federation also claimed the Department of
Agriculture [DARD] could have done more to prevent the outbreak -- the
second in 2 months -- from taking place.
In an earlier incident, believed to have been caused by infection in a
consignment of fish from Britain, 15 000 rainbow trout were wiped out on a
Co Antrim fish farm. Today DARD confirmed the IPN virus had been detected
on a fish farm off the Antrim coast. Northern Ireland had been free of the
disease, which is characterised by fish adopting a "whirling behaviour",
since the mid 1960s.
Newell McCreight, development officer with the Ulster Angling Federation,
expressed concern about the new outbreak. "We are concerned to learn we now
have 2 outbreaks of this serious virus," he said. "This could have serious
consequences for wild salmon stocks coming into Northern Ireland rivers.
Those stocks have been in decline and we would not want them to be further
affected. Around 5 million pounds [7.95 million USD] has been spent in
recent years on salmon enhancement projects in the province. We think the
Department of Agriculture could have done more to prevent these outbreaks,"
he added.
