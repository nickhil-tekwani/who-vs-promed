NEW RABIES VACCINE IN THE USA
This is hardly a new vaccine. It has been available in Asian countries and
Europe for about 10 years and we have had extensive experience with this
excellent product as well as other "second generation" rabies vaccines such
as Purified Vero Cell Vaccine (Merieux) and Purified Duck Embryo Vaccine
(Swiss Serum and Vaccine Institute). These vaccines can, in our extensive
experience, be interchanged in a patient who is traveling.
The main, perhaps only, advantage of these products is that they are less
expensive than HDCV (human diploid cell rabies vaccine). They have made is
possible in poor countries to replace the dangerous and poorly immunogenic
Semple and Suckling Mouse products still being used in many places. In
Thailand, PCEC manufactured in Germany costs US$ 5=8 per dose (depending on
currently flexible exchange rates). Human Diploid cell vaccine costs 3-4
times this. It would be interesting to see what PCEC will cost in North
America. Ask the dealer!
