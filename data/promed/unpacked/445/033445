The Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection has confirmed that a St. Croix County horse tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) yesterday [8 Apr 2014].

A statement on the department's website indicated that the horse tested positive for the non-neuropathic strain of the virus on virus isolation and blood, and the horse's condition is improving.

"This is only the 2nd horse in Wisconsin to have tested positive for the virus," the statement read. "A 3rd horse was euthanized and later tested negative for the virus."

In an 8 Apr 2014 Facebook post, Anoka Equine Veterinary Services in Elk River, Minnesota said they are awaiting test results on an Isanti County, Minnesota horse who "was neurologic and unable to urinate. This horse is at a large facility, and that facility has been closed; no new horses have entered the property. This means (the virus) was (likely) brought in by a human in some way, on equipment, shoes, hands, tack, etc. This is an entirely new case and does have a high probability of having positive results. Test results are expected back this coming Friday or Monday [18 or 21 Apr 2014]."

The Wisconsin state veterinarian recommends that owners keep horses with a fever and clinical signs of contagious respiratory infection at home and not take them to shows, competitions, clinics, or public trail rides, the Wisconsin statement noted.

"Horse owners should also be aware that transportation of horses to competitions, shows, and clinics may increase the risk of exposure to infectious organisms," the statement continued. "Although humans can't be infected by EHV-1, they can aid in spreading it to their horses. Therefore, owners of affected horses should wash and disinfect their hands and change their clothes before coming into contact with healthy horses to prevent the potential spread of these infectious organisms."

EHV-1 is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form). Myeloencephalopathy is characterized by fever, ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of limbs, and incontinence. TheHorse.com will provide updates as additional information becomes available.

[This disease can spread fairly fast. It is often recommended to take the animal's temperature at least twice a day to help catch an early rise, which may be the 1st signal of the disease. If there is a rise in resting temperature (1st thing in the morning, before the animals have begun to move around much), then it is advisable to contact your veterinarian immediately.

This disease is often abbreviated as EHV for equine herpesvirus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2 and 10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, antiviral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.

This is a disease that has a profound effect on horses and owners. Horses have a very tough time recovering from this disease, and owners have a difficult time treating or euthanizing their pets/companions.

This disease is not to be toyed with. Owners should heed the words of the veterinarians. Enforce the rest and isolation of your horse. Protect your horse and other horses as well.
