At least 165 children have died since the end of August [2021] due to an unknown disease in the southwest of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Congolese news portal Actualite reported on Thursday [21 Oct 2021], citing officials. The disease first emerged in the town of Gungu, Kwilu Province, in August, affecting children up to age 5. Regional health chief Jean-Pierre Basake was cited as saying that some of the infected children displayed malaria-like symptoms.

"It looks like malaria and the rapid test returns positive, but aside from malaria, some [children] suffer from a disease we know nothing about that causes anaemia," Basake said. The Kwilu health ministry has yet to begin studying the source of the disease and develop countermeasures, the minister said.

Alain Nzamba, the head of the Mukedi rural commune, told the newspaper that the disease is killing an average of 4 children every day in the villages of Lozo Munene and Kinzamba.

[There is very little concrete information in the text. This is a highly endemic area for malaria, so many children are expected to be malaria positive, and that does not necessarily indicate that malaria is the cause.

We have no information about the presence of fever. In younger children with fever, malaria would be the obvious first thought, but these children would have been treated with an artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT). If this is malaria, it would therefore have to be artemisinin resistant, and we have no report of such resistance from the DRC.

Other possibilities are leptospirosis, if contact with water; shigella, if bloody diarrhea; visceral leishmaniasis, but that evolves slowly and that does not seem to be the case here; and of course viral haemorrhagic fevers, like Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). However, CCHF is tick-borne, and the rapid spread suggests direct person-to-person transmission. Yellow fever and Lassa fever are other possibilities.

ProMED would greatly appreciate any additional information that could help eludicate the cause of these many unfortunate deaths of children in the DRC. - Mod.EP
