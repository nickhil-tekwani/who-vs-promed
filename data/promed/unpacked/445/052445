A 4th patient at University of Washington [UW] Medical Center has been diagnosed with legionella [infection], also known as legionnaires' disease. UW Medicine and the King County Health Department say the patient was hospitalized in the Cascade Tower. That's the same place tests have shown the bacteria exists in an ice machine, a sink, and 3 pieces of operating room equipment which did not make contact with patients.

The patient, a man in his 40s, had an underlying medical condition that made him more at risk for contracting the disease. He was there before new precautions were put in place to protect patients from the bacteria. He is in a satisfactory condition.

Two of the 4 patients diagnosed with [legionellosis] have died, but it's not clear whether the cause of death for one of them was from the bacteria.

UW says it will begin chemically treating the water in the Cascade Tower early next week until the legionella is eliminated.

UW Medicine plans to contact specific high-risk patients who were hospitalized between 24 Aug and 13 Sep 2016 in the Cascade Tower to educate them about signs and symptoms of [legionnaires' disease]. UW has also activated a legionella information line: 855-520-2252.
