Deadly H5N1 may be brewing in cats
-------------------------------------------
Bird flu hasn't gone away. The discovery, announced last week, that
the H5N1 bird flu virus is widespread in cats in locations across
Indonesia has refocused attention on the danger that the deadly virus
could be mutating into a form that can infect humans far more easily.
In the 1st survey of its kind, an Indonesian scientist has found that
in areas where there have been outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry and
humans, one in 5 cats have been infected with the virus and survived.
This suggests that as outbreaks continue to flare across Asia and
Africa, H5N1 will have vastly more opportunities to adapt to mammals
than had been supposed.
Chairul Anwar Nidom of Airlangga University in Surabaya, Indonesia,
told journalists last week that he had taken blood samples from 500
stray cats near poultry markets in 4 areas of Java, including the
capital, Jakarta, and one area in Sumatra, all of which have recently
had outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry and people.
Of these cats, 20 per cent carried antibodies to H5N1. This does not
mean that they were still carrying the virus, only that they had been
infected, probably through eating birds that had H5N1. Many other
cats that were infected are likely to have died from the resulting
illness, so many more than 20 per cent of the original cat
populations may have acquired H5N1.
This is a much higher rate of infection than has been found in
surveys of apparently healthy birds in Asia. "I am quite taken aback
by the results," says Nidom, who also found the virus in Indonesian
pigs in 2005. He plans further tests of the samples at the University
of Tokyo in February 2007.
Amin Soebandrio, head of medical sciences at the Indonesian ministry
for research and technology, confirmed the report. He says that the
infection has also been found in dogs and cats on the Indonesian
island of Bali, which has also had outbreaks of H5N1. The new
findings follow reports that unusually large numbers of dead cats
have been found near many outbreaks of H5N1. "Javanese farmers even
have a word for the cat disease," says Albert Osterhaus of Erasmus
University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It was Osterhaus's lab
which in 2004 found that cats can catch the H5N1 virus. Like humans,
some cats die and some recover. But unlike humans, infected cats shed
large amounts of the virus and pass it to each other.
Infected cats may not directly increase the danger of people catching
the virus, as humans seem to catch the current strain only with
difficulty even from birds, which they kill, pluck and eat. The main
worry, says Osterhaus, is that as the virus replicates in cats, it
will further adapt to mammals and acquire the ability to spread more
efficiently to people and from person to person, unleashing a human pandemic.
Nidom's findings are the 1st to indicate what proportion of cats can
become infected by H5N1. No cats have been tested in Hong Kong or
China. In Bangkok, Thailand all the cats in one household are known
to have died of H5N1 in 2004. Tigers and leopards in Thai zoos also
died, while last year [2006], 2 cats near an outbreak in poultry and
people in Iraq were confirmed to have died of H5N1, as were 3 German
cats that ate wild birds. In Austria, cats were infected but remained
healthy (New Scientist, 18 Mar 2006, p 6).
Though Osterhaus says Nidom's figures must be confirmed, he says they
aren't surprising, and is even encouraged that they aren't worse. A
higher percentage of infected predators than prey makes sense, as
each predator eats many prey animals. "At least that percentage shows
the virus has not completely adapted to cats, yet," Osterhaus says.
If it had, all cats in a stricken area should be infected, as with
ordinary flu in humans.
Osterhaus emphasizes that the cat infections still pose a potential
threat. "We know the 1918 pandemic was a bird flu virus that adapted
to mammals in some intermediate mammalian host, possibly pigs," he
says. "Maybe for H5N1, the intermediate host is cats." If similar
percentages of cats are infected at every outbreak location, there
must have been many thousands of cat infections since the virus
emerged, compared to 267 confirmed cases in humans. Every sick cat is
a chance for the virus to adapt, and with renewed outbreaks this year
[2007] in birds, people or both in China, Indonesia, Japan, South
Korea, Hong Kong, Viet Nam, Thailand, Egypt and Nigeria, it is
getting plenty of such chances.
Killing cats won't solve the problem, Osterhaus warns. Like shooting
wild birds, it is unlikely to have much impact and could send
infected animals elsewhere. It would also lead to a population
explosion of disease-carrying rodents, which the cats normally keep in check.
"Cats must just be kept from eating sick chickens," Osterhaus says,
though this will be a tall order in open-air markets across Asia and
Africa, which are typically swarming with hungry cats. In Jakarta
this week, officials are slaughtering thousands of banned backyard
poultry then handing them back for their owners to eat. Some of the
birds could well be infected despite appearing healthy. It is hard to
imagine the local cats not getting their share.

Bird flu confirmed in southern Japanese prefecture
-----------------------------------------------
The Japan agriculture ministry on Thursday [25 Jan 2007] confirmed
that the virus detected in the 2nd case in a month of birds' mass
death in Miyazaki Prefecture is the highly virulent H5 strain of the
bird flu virus.
The result was based on a test by the National Institute of Animal
Health in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture, which will further analyze the
virus sample to determine if it was the lethal H5N1 type, Kyodo News reported.
About 1300 birds died in mass from Monday to Wednesday [22-24 Jan
2007] at a farm in the city of Hyuga. It was the 2nd bird flu case in
a month in the prefecture and the 6th in Japan since 2004.
Earlier this month [January 2007], a farm in the town of Kiyotake, 60
km away from Hyuga, saw 3500 of its birds killed by the H5N1 strain
of bird flu and had all of its 12 000 birds incinerated.
Bird flu infections hit dozens of farms in central Japan's Ibaraki
prefecture in 2005 and 2006, resulting in the killing of at least 5.8
million poultry.

Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5) in Hungary: Disease Report
-----------------------------------------------
Hungary has reported a case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza,
virus type H5 in a commercial geese flock in the central county of
Csongrad. The 1st clinical signs appeared on 21 Jan 2007, and the
entire flock is being destroyed. Laboratory investigations are
underway to confirm the strain of the virus.
The Hungarian authorities stated that there are no poultry within a
1-km zone from the affected premise. There are 57 poultry holdings
within a 3-km zone and 850 small-scale farms within a 10-km zone.
Situation Assessment
---------------------
Hungary reported cases of HPAI in wild birds in various locations in
early 2006. Hungary also reported an outbreak of HPAI in free-range
domestic poultry in Bacs-Kiskun county in mid 2006.
The TRACES electronic database indicates that there have been no
imports of poultry or poultry products from Hungary to the UK for the
past 3 months.
There were no reports of HPAI in Europe in autumn 2006, compared to
the autumn of 2005 when cases of HPAI were reported in Romania (wild
birds and backyard poultry) and Croatia (wild birds). Furthermore,
surveillance of wild birds, which is currently carried out EU-wide,
has not revealed any positive results for HPAI in wild birds, so far.
The autumn 2006 migratory season is now complete for most wild bird
species. In previous risk assessments, we considered that if the
virus should be present in the flyways of wild birds (e.g. in
breeding grounds that stretch from the northern part of western
Russia to the near Continent) this would increase the likelihood for
introduction of the virus to other northwest European countries and
to the UK, particularly in areas known to host large concentrations
of wild migratory waterbirds. However, migratory movements direct
from breeding areas to the UK are less likely than flights in which
birds stop at staging areas prior to arrival in the UK. Thus, any
estimate of the likelihood of introduction of the virus to the UK
during this migratory season should be reviewed in light of any
detection of the virus in wild birds in north-west European countries
en-route to the UK. Experience from 2006 suggests that it may take
some time for the virus to perpetuate in susceptible wild bird
populations and result in cases of the disease under the right
conditions (e.g. overcrowding at limited habitats due to cold weather, stress).
It is unknown at present whether H5N1 infection has persisted in wild
bird populations throughout the year in the EU or Europe in the
absence of further introductions. If infection does persist either
within wild birds or their environment, there is uncertainty as to
whether it will remain confined to certain locations or extend
geographically and/or become established in a wider range of wild
bird species. One indication of such a development would be further
sporadic detections, in particular during the period when resident
wild waterfowl congregate in large numbers. The likelihood for
further spread of the disease is difficult to estimate in the absence
of targeted and practical surveillance studies. Nevertheless, this
highlights the importance of continuing to maintain appropriate
biosecurity standards with regard to preventing mixing of wild birds
with domestic poultry.
Recent experiences have also suggested that other wild bird species
(e.g. raptors, feral pigeons) can be affected by HPAI with a fatal
outcome. It still remains uncertain to what extent these species may
play in the epidemiology of the virus and its potential spread over
wider geographic areas. It is important to continue to monitor for
these types of dead birds which may indicate the presence of the
virus in local wild bird populations.
As it currently stands, continued monitoring of developments and
targeted surveillance of wild birds in the EU and the countries
neighboring the EU are vital, as is the analysis of the accumulated
data in order to better understand the risks. Recent developments in
the EU highlight that surveillance, complemented with appropriate
policy advice on biosecurity measures proportionate to the risks are
an effective way of detecting and minimizing the introduction of the
virus into commercial poultry operations.
Conclusion
-----------
Based on the disease report and situation assessment, the likelihood
of the introduction of this disease from Hungary to the UK via legal
trade before and after this outbreak is considered negligible.
On the basis of this outbreak, which appears to be attributed to
introduction from wild birds, and experience from 2006, it could be
expected that further cases may occur. Should the virus continue to
be detected in eastern part of Europe, there may be an increased
likelihood of the introduction of the virus to the UK from this area.
However, direct movements to the UK are less likely from this region,
and risk should be reviewed in the light of potential detection of
the virus in wild birds in northeast, central and southern Europe.
These areas are mainly within the main flyway of waterbirds migrating
from southern Siberia southwards via the Volga Basin and the Caspian
Sea region.
