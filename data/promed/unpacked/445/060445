The [Singapore] Primary Production Department (PPD) has stopped all imports
of pork and pork products from Taiwan because of the recent outbreak of
foot-and-mouth disease there. The suspension, from March 22, will last until
these products meet the department's animal health and veterinary public
health standards.
China, the Netherlands and Sweden are major pork suppliers to Singapore,
Taiwan is not.
The last shipment of frozen pork from Taiwan arrived in Singapore on March
13. "The pigs were slaughtered on Feb 28 and sent to Singapore on March 13,
long before the outbreak, so it is safe," PPD said.
The Straits Times understands that XXXXX [name deleted] is the only importer
here of frozen pork products from Taiwan. But its managing director would
not confirm or deny this. "We only buy a small quantity and supply to one to
two restaurants here," he said. But he would not name the restaurants and
also declined to be named. He said it imported the products at the
restaurants' request. Asked about its last shipment, he insisted it had
stopped such imports "a few months ago".
Last year, Singapore imported 15.6 tonnes valued at $186,000 from Taiwan
while 9,436 tonnes in all, valued at $31.3 million came from China, the
Netherlands and Sweden. It also imported 1.26 million live pigs from
Malaysia and Indonesia for slaughter, supplying 84,000 tonnes.
The PPD spokesman said: "Although the virus does not affect human beings, we
want to be safe because we have cattle and goats here." If it spreads into
the region, there could be a serious outbreak because neighbouring countries
have many pig, goat and cattle farms, he said.

The so-called Taiwan pork sausages that are a popular local snack are made
in Singapore, the two sausage makers here said yesterday. The Taiwan sausage
is different from the Chinese sausage, or lup cheong. It is thicker,
shorter, juicier, and soft even when it is uncooked, unlike the Chinese ones
which are thin, long, dry and hard.
Madam Liao Hsiang Chung, 33, a director of Genta Food, which makes the
sausages in a factory in Woodlands Industrial park, said the sausage got its
name because it originated in Taiwan.
Another Taiwan sausage maker, Toh Yi Food Products, also said its sausages
are made locally. Its managing director, Mr Chiang Hock Kai, 45, said the
company uses pork from Malaysia.
Mr Toh Beng Kee, 42, who sells Taiwan sausages, fishballs and otak otak and
mua chee at a Serangoon Avenue 3 hawker stall, said his sales have not been
affected. "People are still buying these sausages. But I do make it a point
to tell them that they are made locally."

TAIPEI -- Taiwan has little chance of resuming pork exports to Japan, its
main market, within five years, according to an official yesterday. Mr Chyr
Shuang-ching, a senior official in the Cabinet-level Agriculture Council,
said: "It will be difficult to resume porkexports to Japan within five years."
The council banned all fresh- and frozen-pork exports on March 20 after
confirming an outbreak of this disease.
Japan and South Korea, the main foreign markets for its pork,responded by
banning pork imports from Taiwan to protect their own herds.
