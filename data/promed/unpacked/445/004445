YERSINIA - JAPAN: IMPORTED (02)
**************************

From: Robert Savage <RSAVAGE@ci.madison.wi.us>
I may be naive, but is there some reason to believe that pathogenic _Yersina
sp_ didn't exist in Japan in the past. Is the only source imported?

[No reason whatsoever, as far as I know. At least _Y. enterocolitica_ has
been isolated in Japan. I suspect this report was made because it reflects
good surveillance for a potential pathogen. -- Mod CHC]
