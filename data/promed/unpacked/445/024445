Officials from South Sudan's Ministry of Health are selling yellow fever cards at Juba International Airport without having given vaccination, sources told Radio Tamazuj.

International regulations require proof of yellow fever vaccination for travel to and from certain countries. People who get vaccinated should be given an International Certificate of Vaccination [and those who have not been vaccinated should not receive them. - Mod.TY].

South Sudanese nationals traveling abroad via Juba Internationals Airport have to pay up to 200 SSP [USD 66] to obtain a yellow fever card without getting vaccinated. "They charged me 200 SSP in order to obtain yellow cards without even being vaccinated," one traveler complained.

South Sudanese who travel to Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan are required to obtain yellow fever vaccination at least 10 days before their flight, but officials in the health ministry and some National Security personnel are allegedly selling these cards at the airport, according to sources in Juba.

The cards are reportedly scarce at the State Ministry of Health in Central Equatoria, which was responsible for issuing the cards at a cost of up to 64 SSP [USD 21].

"I went to Ministry of Health to get vaccinated against yellow fever and get the card but I was told that they got finished but was referred to some persons at Juba International airport where I got only the card and paid 150 SSP [USD 49]" said another traveler.

[The sale of fake yellow fever (YF) certificates has been a problem in Nigeria in the past (see ProMED-mail archive citations below), and has occurred in Zambia and Zimbabwe as well and now, in South Sudan. As noted in the comments related to the Nigerian situation, the sale of fake yellow fever vaccination cards or issuance of certificates to individuals who did not receive the vaccine presents a serious public health problem inside and outside South Sudan. Susceptible unvaccinated individuals could contribute to a YF outbreak within or outside the country.

YF outbreaks have occurred in Sudan, and South Sudan is also likely at risk. Yellow fever is not new to the Sudan. Between 3 Oct and 24 Nov 2013, a total of 44 confirmed cases of YF were reported, including 14 deaths. A total of 12 localities in West and South Kordofan were affected by that outbreak. There was a large YF outbreak in Sudan's Darfur state in 2012-2013. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that over 840 people were infected with yellow fever in Darfur and that the epidemic had affected 35 out of 64 localities in the region since September 2012.

If this report is true -- that employees of the Ministry of Health are issuing YF vaccination cards without vaccinations -- that is alarming. Issuance of fake YF vaccination cards, or cards without vaccination, carries potentially serious adverse consequences both within South Sudan and outside the country. An unvaccinated viremic individual with a card who becomes infected in a country such as Sudan, where YF virus outbreaks have occurred, could bring the virus to South Sudan. Conversely, an unvaccinated viremic individual with a card who becomes infected in South Sudan could carry YF virus to localities where vector mosquitoes are present and initiate an outbreak of this serious disease. One wonders, if the practice of issuance of YF cards without vaccination continues, whether countries most at risk because of the presence of vector mosquitoes in Central and North America, South, and Southeast Asia will likely deny visas to or admittance of individuals coming from South Sudan, where the certificates are being sold, unless they can prove that their cards are legitimate and reflect actual vaccination. Public health authorities and law enforcement agencies in South Sudan and any other countries where the certificates are being sold without vaccination should crack down on the practice swiftly and end it. It is also critical that YF vaccine be consistently available in government clinics at affordable cost so that there is no demand for the purchase of cards.
