Test results from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service have identified
the cause of a fish kill at a Lewis County lake. DNR biologist Kevin
Yokum says that tests have identified the cause of the fish kill as
columnaris disease. It typically affects one species during an
outbreak. In this case, it was crappie. Yokum says about 1500 fish
have died since early last week [week of 24 May 2010] at Stonewall
Jackson Lake.

"The bacterium exists naturally in many lakes, and it can cause a
disease outbreak when there are stressful conditions to fish," he
said. "A lot of these occur during the springtime, with a rapid
increase in water temperature, and it's coupled with spawning
activity, the post-stress of the spawning itself."

Yokum says the DNR is still finding dead fish in the Lewis County
lake. About 20 dead fish were found yesterday [3 Jun 2010]. He says
live fish infected with columnaris are edible and safe to eat but he
urges people to cook them thoroughly. Yokum says fish that have the
disease have a bitter taste.

[_Flavobacterium columnare_ is a gram-negative rod that has the
appearance of a fungus but is actually a bacterium. It is sometimes
known as "cotton wool disease". The common signs are fuzzy or
stringy-looking patches on the fins or the body that may vary in color
from white to gray or beige. Infected fish are often lethargic,
anorexic and may suffer a loss of coloration. If left untreated, the
bacteria will likely spread and may lead to death.
