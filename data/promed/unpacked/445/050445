Cattle test positive for enzootic bovine leukosis
-------------------------------------------------
Cattle fed on imported colostrum substitute have tested positive for
enzootic bovine leukosis. The Department for Environment Food and Rural
Affairs (DEFRA) tests on 3 UK farms found calves had picked up the disease
from Calf's Choice Total, a Canadian-produced colostrum which is
distributed by Alta UK.

DEFRA said there was no direct animal health risk from using the product,
but said the herds affected had been placed under movement restriction.

[The following information has been abridged from DEFRA's Summary profile
for enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL), available at

Summary profile for enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL)
--------------------------------------------------
1. Description: A viral disease of cattle causing malignant tumours in
affected animals. Clinical signs only appear in a very small proportion of
infected cattle usually when they are at least 4-5 years old. Tumours
develop in many parts of the body; there is loss of appetite, loss of
weight and a fall in milk production. Once these clinical signs appear the
disease rapidly leads to death of the animal. The virus is present in the
white blood cells of infected animals and the disease is transmitted
through close physical contact and the transfer of tissues containing
blood. Transmission by contaminated needles, surgical instruments or biting
insects is possible.
2. Rationale for government intervention:
2.1 Protection of human health: the disease does not affect humans.
2.2 Society: as only a small proportion of infected animals develop
clinical signs, the economic consequences of the disease are relatively low
at an industry level although the impact on individual farms may be
considerable.
2.3 Trade: assurances on EBL status are required for trade in live animals
and products.
2.4 Welfare: not the primary reason for intervention but welfare is
compromised as a result of infection and subsequent illness.
3. Legislative overview: EU and domestic legislation aims to eradicate the
disease and to prevent its spread through trade in live animals and products.
4. Geographic distribution:
GB 足 The disease was eradicated from Great Britain (GB) in 1996 following a
national programme of blood and milk testing. GB is classified as
officially EBL-free by the EU.
EU 足 A number of countries and regions of the European Union (EU) have
achieved officially EBL-free status. The disease however remains common in
many European countries.
International 足 The disease is common in Canada, the USA, and in South
America. There is a low level of infection in Australia and New Zealand.
5. Risk of introduction/spread: low 足 Although the disease is widespread
throughout the world, imported cattle are subject to certification and
testing requirements which minimise the risk of introduction. Potential
routes of entry of the disease to GB: importation of infected carrier
animals. Importation of semen containing infected blood cells.
6. Human health implications: the disease does not affect humans and there
is no risk to human health.
7. GB Disease control strategy: the disease control strategy in GB is to
maintain EBL free status by regular serological screening of the national
herd through blood and milk sampling and to stamp out any disease which is
introduced into the country.
8. Current Surveillance: EBL is a notifiable disease and there is a
national testing programme. Tumours in live animals or in carcases must be
notified to the divisional veterinary manager, who ensures that tests are
carried out for EBL. Structured surveys of the national cattle herd take
place by regular tests on bulk milk samples or blood samples. These show
that the country remains free from the disease. - Mod.AS]
