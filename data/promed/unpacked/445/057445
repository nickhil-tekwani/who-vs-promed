China's agriculture ministry said on Wednesday [24 Oct 2018] it would ban the feeding of kitchen waste to pigs after linking the practice to the majority of the early cases of African swine fever [ASF].

Beijing has not yet said how the disease 1st entered the country but the ministry found that 62 percent of the 1st 21 outbreaks were related to the feeding of kitchen waste, a statement published on its website said.

"These outbreaks were mostly located in urban-rural boundaries and were particularly evident in several cases in early September [2018] in Anhui province," the statement said. Anhui is an eastern province whose capital, Hefei, is located about 415 km (258 miles) west of Shanghai.

The virus was also detected in kitchen waste fed to pigs on a farm in the Inner Mongolia region. "After the provinces with outbreaks and neighboring provinces completely banned feeding of kitchen waste to pigs, the epidemic was greatly reduced, which fully demonstrates the importance of completely prohibiting the feeding of waste," the statement said.

Kitchen waste or swill is widely used in China to feed hogs, particularly by small farmers, as it is cheaper than manufactured pig feed. Regulations require that the swill must be heated to a certain temperature before being consumed, but industry experts say that step is often skipped.

The ministry also said in the statement that it will set up a registration system for vehicles transporting live hogs, poultry, and other livestock to control the spread of the disease better. The long-distance transport of live hogs has been the main channel for transmitting ASF across different regions. Vehicles transporting pigs and other animals will also no longer be allowed to use the "green channel" for priority on roads that is normally permitted for the trucking of fresh produce, added the ministry.

The statement also called for more slaughtering closer to farms and the use of refrigerated [pork] transportation to better manage the supply of livestock across different regions. China has promoted construction of new farms in the northeast in recent years, closer to its grain supplies. But the policy, which has not yet been accompanied by investment in new slaughterhouses, has led to large numbers of pigs being trucked long distances south.

[Guizhou has become China's 13th ASF-affected province/main administrative region. The other 12 include 10 provinces (Anhui, Heilongjiang, Henan, Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanxi, Yunnan, and Hunan) and 2 additional administrative regions (Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Tianjin Municipality). The affected territories stretch from China's northeastern provinces bordering Mongolia and Russia, continuing along the eastern shores and then westwards to south-central China. To view all outbreaks, go to OIE's global ASF map at https://tinyurl.com/y899xbvf, click on the Chinese cluster, and zoom in.

Guizhou is situated between the 2 recent newly affected provinces, Yunnan and Hunan. - Mod.AS]

[3] Restrictions on export of agricultural produce to Japan

Japan has stopped the import from China of locally produced rice straw, used in Japan for the feeding of beef cattle. The ban took place as a result of the spread of African swine fever in China. About 30 percent of China's exporting rice-straw processing plants are located in the northeastern part of China, within 50 km [about 31 mi] from affected farms. No effective treatment of the rice straw is currently available for the product to be legally imported into Japan.

According to animal quarantine stations in Japan, the imports from 25 facilities that cut and process rice straw in China's Liaoning and Jilin provinces have been stopped from exporting, and 4 additional places are pending. According to the National Beef Cattle Cooperative Association, "The impact on domestic fattening farmers will be significant, and this situation will continue until the end of the year."

[Japan's ban on imports of rice straw from ASF-stricken areas in China, which are intended to be included in animal feed in Japan, reflects international concerns on the wide dissemination of the virus in China, increasing the hazard of its possible spread to other countries. This hazard would have been even higher if wild boar were affected in China. This serious deterioration has, according to available sources, not taken place so far.

Since the China Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MoARA) confirmed its 1st African swine fever (ASF) outbreak (in Liaoning province on 3 Aug 2018), ASF has been detected in 53 villages (the smallest available administrative units in 13 provinces/autonomous regions/municipalities; see commentary to item 2 above). More than 210 000 pigs have been culled in an effort to halt further spread.

The following main actions have been taken by China:

The government set a 3 km [about 1.9 mi] epidemic zone and a 10 km [about 6.2 mi] buffer zone around the epidemic zone. Within a province, movement of live pigs from the county/city/province where ASF occurred is suspended; live pig markets in infected provinces and adjacent provinces are closed; movement of live pigs and pork products from provinces with more than 2 infected cities is prohibited; and transport of live pigs from provinces adjacent to ASF-affected are suspended. Breeding pigs can be transported from provinces with an epidemic zone with a laboratory ASF test certificate, but passing through provinces with an epidemic zone when transporting live pigs is not allowed. The government has been strengthening transport of pork meat rather than of live pigs.

As reported in item 1 above, on 24 Oct 2018, the China State Council issued a notice to further strengthen ASF control using more stringent measures, including a strict nationwide ban on swill feeding to pigs and recordkeeping of livestock transportation vehicles. - Mod.AS
