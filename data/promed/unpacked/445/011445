The measles outbreak detected in Asturias in May 2011, after more than
a decade with no positive diagnoses, has now been contained. The
health authorities anticipate that any new cases will be confined to
people arriving in Asturias from regions with active measles
transmission, although further patient-related cases within the
Principality of Asturias cannot be entirely ruled out.

Despite this favourable situation, the administration does not want to
relax its precautions, insisting that vaccination is the best means of
protection of the community and that the best way to keep the disease
under control is continued surveillance and early diagnosis.

In the 4 months of the outbreak of measles in Asturias, 36 cases were
reported initially, but subsequently 13 were discounted. Of the 23
positives, one is still under investigation; another has been
confirmed by an epidemiological link to a previous patient; 2 have
appropriate symptoms but lack clinical samples, while the remaining 13
have been confirmed unambiguously.

15 of the patients were male, and 8 were female. The 1st case was
detected on 4 May 2011 and subsequently the rate of appearance of new
patients with symptoms was rapid. By the end of June 2011, that is in
less than 2 months, it was suspected that the outbreak had involved 25
patients. The Health authorities now report that the spread of the
virus in Asturias in the last month "has been almost nil," leading to
the conclusion that the outbreak is now under control.

Measles is a highly contagious viral disease, against which the
Asturian population have vaccinated for more than 30 years. Despite
the high vaccination coverage, the emergence of new foci from a single
infected patient can occur, especially in infants who, because of
their young age, may not have been vaccinated. The health authorities
believe that all those born before 1978 in Asturias are protected,
since laboratory tests have confirmed their immunity. Others will have
received 2 doses of MMR vaccine.

So why has this outbreak occurred? In fact, 5 of the victims were
children under 15 months and, therefore, had not yet been vaccinated.
Three others were children between 16 months and 3 years and had
received only a single dose of vaccine at that stage. Four were
persons born prior to 1982 and were unvaccinated. Of the remaining 11,
aged between 3 and 30, 4 were found not to have been vaccinated;
another was of unknown immune status; one had received only one dose,
and the remainder were infected despite being vaccinated.

The region of Asturias with the highest incidence was Mieres. The
initial case was a teenager who had spent Easter in Madrid and had
exposed his brother to the infection. Both went to ER Alvarez-Buylla
Hospital, where they in turn infected other patients.

The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) today [6 Aug 2011] expressed growing
alarm over the plight of refugees in the Dollo Ado camps in
south-eastern Ethiopia following an outbreak of suspected measles.
UNHCR fears the outbreak could lead to high mortality and serious
illness in an already vulnerable refugee population whose overall
health is already fragile. An outbreak could also reverse the progress
which has been made over the last several weeks to stabilise Somali
refugees, many of whom arrived in Ethiopia in extremely poor health.

Officially, there have so far been 47 cases and 3 deaths from
suspected measles in the Kobe camp of 25 000 people over the last
week. But on 4 Aug 2011 alone, community health workers reported 25
deaths in the camp, half of which were suspected to be from measles.
Refugee children are the most affected. Other suspected cases have
been reported in the other 2 refugee camps in the area, as well as in
the transit centre where there are just over 15 000 refugees awaiting
relocation to the newly-opened Hilaweyn camp.

According to medical experts, measles in healthy populations does not
kill, but measles complications do. In the context of the refugee
camps in Dollo Ado, the mix of measles and high levels of malnutrition
can be fatal. "This situation is alarming, and we cannot afford to
wait. We must act now, urgently and decisively, to arrest and turn
around this situation," Moses Okello, UNHCR's Representative in
Ethiopia, said after returning from Dollo Ado for a firsthand
assessment of the situation.

Okello who said he was "shaken" by the situation in the Dollo Ado
camps, held an urgent meeting Saturday [6 Aug 2011] with Ethiopian
government officials and UNHCR health partners to agree to a plan of
action. He said the "number one priority is a mass vaccination
campaign," noting that the emergency required "seamless teamwork" for
an effective response.

He called on all UNHCR health partners to scale up their capacity to
meet the "extremely serious public health challenges." UNICEF and WHO,
through Ethiopia's Ministry of Health, are providing the needed
vaccines. Vaccination of all children between the ages of 6 months and
15 years was started on Friday [5 Aug 2011] for all refugee children
being transferred from the transit centre to the newly-opened Hilaweyn
camps. Some 300 children were vaccinated before relocation, and 7
cases of suspected measles were isolated for in-patient care at the
transit centre. The relocation is expected to be completed within a
fortnight with daily convoys of 1000 people.

Following Saturday's [6 Aug 2011] meeting, UNHCR and the government
will lead a UN/NGO team of health experts to Dollo Ado on Sun 7 Aug
2011 to support the roll-out of a plan of action, which includes the
preparation of a mass vaccination campaign to begin on Tue 9 Aug 20
for all children aged 6 months to 15 years in Kobe camp, the most
affected camp. The vaccination campaign, which will include
vaccination against polio, will be extended to the other camps as well
as to the hosting communities where deemed necessary by the health
authorities.

Health workers emphasised the importance of proper management of
identified suspected measles, particularly as vaccines provide
protection only 14 days after administration. They also agreed to
strengthen surveillance and case finding using community health
workers, to set up satellite and mobile health clinics to improve
access to health services, and to intensify a mass information
campaign which started Fri 5 Aug 2011. An isolation ward in Kobe camp
is also being set up, and additional health personnel are being
dispatched to help manage this ward as well as additional clinics in
the camps.

Health experts said high rates of acute malnutrition, low vaccination
coverage in Somalia, and overcrowding in the camps are some of the
aggravating factors associated with this outbreak. They also cited
poor hygiene habits and poor health-seeking behaviour as challenges.

As of Fri 5 Aug 2011, the number of Somali refugees in the Dollo Ado
camps had reached 118 400. Nearly 78 000 of them arrived this year
[2011]. This is in addition to more than 41 600 Somali refugees in the
Jijiga area of the Somali region. Ethiopia hosts a total of 237 500
refugees, mainly from Somalia, Eritrea and Sudan.

A 3.5 year old boy of Manemoole tribal hamlet in H D Kote
[sub-district] who died recently succumbed to measles.

According to a [statement] from district health and family welfare
officer Dr S M Malegowda, the lab reports have confirmed the death of
the boy as due to measles. The boy and 3 other children had been
admitted to the primary health centre in D B Kuppe for viral fever.
However, the baby died on 6 Aug 2011. The blood samples of all the
children had been collected and sent for testing at the National
Institute of Virology in Bangalore. The reports on 10 Aug 2011
confirmed the cause of death as measles. The remaining kids are
undergoing treatment at Vivekananda Hospital and are recuperating.

[Children] with similar symptoms (viral fever with rashes) have not
been reported in other tribal hamlets, but health officers have been
instructed to take precautionary measures, according to Dr S M
Malegowda's statement.

Two new measles cases have been detected in Adelaide, and the health
authorities are urging the public to update their vaccinations. South
Australia (SA) Health issued an alert today [12 Aug 2011], saying the
new cases were linked to a man with measles who flew from Dubai to
Adelaide on 8 Jul 2011. One of the new cases worked 2 shifts at a
Burnside shoe shop and spent a night in Hindley Street bars while
infectious.

SA Health chief medical officer Professor Paddy Phillips said measles
was highly contagious and people who had been in those areas should be
alert for symptoms. "SA Health is currently contacting those who may
have spent time with either of these people to provide information and
advice about prevention measures," he said.

"One visited several public places during their infectious period,
including Va Bene at the Burnside Village on Fri 22 Jul 2011 from 11am
to 5:30pm and on Sat 23 Jul 2011 from 10am to 5pm. "The same person
was also in the Hindley Street precinct, including the Red Square Bar
and Lounge and the Rosemont Hotel between 11:50pm on Sat 23 Jul 2011
to 4am on Sun 24 Jul 2011. The latest cases were in "close contact"
with the original case but did not contract the virus on the flight to
Adelaide.

Symptoms usually begin with fever, cough, runny nose, and sore eyes,
followed by a rash which begins on the head and then spreads down the
body. Measles is spread through the air and is highly contagious among
people who are not fully immunised. "Although usually not severe,
complications of measles can include pneumonia, brain damage and
death, and anyone with suspected symptoms should seek advice from
their local doctor," Professor Phillips said. "It is very important,
however, that people phone their GP ahead of any visit and mention why
they are attending, so that precautions can be taken to avoid
spreading disease to others." An alert has been issued to general
practitioners advising them of these cases.

Immunisation provides the best protection against measles. Two doses
of measles-containing vaccine are strongly recommended for anyone born
after 1965. People in this age group are encouraged to check their
vaccination records and request the vaccine if there is no record of 2
doses of measles vaccine.

SA has recorded 3 measles cases in 2011, compared with one in 2010. A
fact sheet about measles can be found on SA Health's website at
http://www.sahealth.sa.gov.au.

[Part [8] in Measles update 2011 (23) 20110717.2169 reported an alert
issued by SA Health concerning the arrival in Australia of a
measles-infected passenger from Dubai. Today's (12 Aug 2011) report
indicates that none of the passengers on that flight are known to have
contracted measles. However, 2 people in contact with the index case
after his arrival have developed measles, and there is now a risk of
spread of the infection in Adelaide.

The Australian New South Wales (NSW) health authorities on Friday [12
Aug 2011] issued a measles vaccination reminder following a spike in
the number of cases in Sydney.

NSW director of health protection Dr Jeremy McAnulty said 7 cases of
measles have been reported in NSW since the start of July 2011. "All 7
cases were acquired in the Sydney metropolitan region, where several
adults in their 20s and 30s were infected," he said.

The rash of cases has puzzled doctors who are unable to pinpoint
precisely the source of the current outbreak. "This is a little
unusual as most cases in NSW tend to be seen in unvaccinated or
partially vaccinated people who have recently returned from travel
overseas. The original source of their infection is unknown," McAnulty
said.

Some 56 measles cases have been recorded in NSW so far in 2011. That
compares to a total of 26 in 2010, 19 in 2009, 39 in 2008, and 3 in
2007.

NSW Health says measles is a serious infection that can lead to severe
complications. "Anyone with measles is extremely infectious, and just
one person with the infection can pass it on to many others," McAnulty
said. NSW Health is urging people to get vaccinated against measles as
soon as possible.

People with measles tend to be unwell and develop fever, cough, runny
nose, sore eyes. A rash starts a few days later, starting on the face
and spreads down the body. Although 90 to 95 per cent of NSW's
population is vaccinated against measles, NSW Health warns that many
people in their 20s, 30s, and early 40s are still vulnerable to
measles because they only ever received one measles mumps and rubella
(MMR) vaccine dose in childhood. The MMR vaccine is safe and effective
and provides long lasting protection if 2 doses are given, NSW Health
says.

There are now 104 confirmed cases of the illness, which is 10 more
than a week ago. Richard Hoskins says health agencies have seen 10 to
14 new cases each week for the past 6 weeks. Dr Hoskins says it is not
an epidemic yet, but there is a strong possibility that numbers will
increase dramatically.

He is urging more people to get immunised, especially young people, as
measles is very infectious. Dr Hoskins says measles is usually a mild
illness, but some people experience serious complications.

Waikato also has a spate of measles cases, with 12 confirmed cases, up
by 2 from a week ago.

A measles outbreak has spread to Auckland Girls' Grammar, with the
regional health service confirming that 2 cases recently diagnosed
were from the school. As of this morning [8 Aug 2010], there have been
104 confirmed cases of the disease in the Auckland region, 7 of which
have required hospitalisation. Six further unimmunised people have
been in contact with the disease and are in quarantine.

Auckland Girls' Grammar has been advised to tell all parents about the
highly infectious disease, the Auckland Regional Public Health Service
says. People who have never had measles and are not immunised are
advised to stay away from work, school and public places for 2 weeks
if they come into contact with the disease.

Most cases of measles in the current outbreak have occurred in west
Auckland, although it has spread to the North Shore, Manukau and
central Auckland. One Australian man who visited Waitakere Hospital in
July 2011 is also confirmed to have caught the disease.

The Auckland Regional Public Health Service warns that pregnant women
who catch measles are at risk of miscarriages, still births, and low
birth weights. Pregnant women cannot be immunised against the disease,
but authorities say it is important for family and close contacts to
be vigilant and protect mothers and their unborn children.
