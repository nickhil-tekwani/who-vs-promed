An 8-month-old child has been tested positive for poliovirus in the Momand Dara district of eastern Nangarhar province, taking the number of positive cases nationwide to 10.

The baby boy had frequently received anti-polio drops in his village Basool, but he got infected with the crippling disease in Pakistan, said Dr. Jan Mohammad, vaccination section head at the provincial Public Health Department.

The public health department said it had decided to conduct a special anti-polio campaign after the emergence of the new polio case.

It was the 3rd positive polio case in Nangarhar this year [2017], when 3 cases were detected in Kandahar, 2 in Helmand, and one each in Kunduz and Zabul provinces.

[As this case has not previously been reported in the global updates (see section [3] below), I presume that this case will be reported in the coming updates (either this week or perhaps next week). The mention that there have been 10 cases reported from Afghanistan raises the question as to whether Afghanistan is not counting this case as a case from Afghanistan, as the media report mentions that the case was infected in Pakistan, and the current total of cases officially reported from Afghanistan is already 10 ... or there is an error in the media report, and the total number of cases reported from Afghanistan is now 11, including this new case. Clarification is awaited.

A map of Afghanistan showing the provinces can be found at: http://www.afghana.com/GetLocal/Afghanistan/Images/Afghanistan.JPG. Nangarhar province is to the direct east of Kabul and extends to the Khyber Pass, which is a passage from Afghanistan to Peshawar Pakistan, located in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, a focus of poliovirus transmission and circulation in Pakistan. - Mod.MPP]

Syria cVDPV2 outbreak Situation Report # 23 - As of 21 Nov 2017
Summary
New cVDPV2 cases this week: 7
Total number of cVDPV2 cases: 70

Most recent case (by date of onset)
Location: Mayadeen, Deir Ez- Zor governorate
Onset of paralysis: [9 Sep 2017],
age: 9 months, vaccination status: 2 OPV/zero IPV

Key highlights
- Seven (7) new cases of cVDPV2 were reported this week -- four (4) cases from Mayadeen and three (3) from Boukamal district, Deir Ez-Zor governorate. The most recent case (by date of onset) is 9 Sep 2017 from Mayadeen district
- The total number of confirmed cVDPV2 cases is 70
- Outbreak response teams are planning a 3rd mass immunization round to reach children under 5 with mOPV2 in areas where evidence of virus transmission continues
- A request from the Syrian Ministry of Health for up to one (1) million doses of mOPV2 and 500 000 IPV doses is being processed to ensure readiness for the 2nd phase of the outbreak response
- Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) aiming to reach children under 5 with bOPV started this week in areas of Rural Damascus, districts of Damascus, Homs, Aleppo, and accessible areas of Deir Ez-Zor city. Children aged 2-23 months will also be reached with supplementary IPV during the sub-national campaign, particularly in areas with large IDP populations
- A joint supervisory team is monitoring the IPV campaign in all areas of Damascus, with a focus on areas where there are large IDP populations from Deir Ez-Zor to ensure campaign quality.

Immunization response
- Since confirmation of the outbreak, World Health Organization and UNICEF has coordinated with the Government of Syria and local authorities to carry out a strategic response to stop cVDPV2 transmission. Two mass vaccination rounds have been carried out in Deir Ez-Zor and Raqqa governorates, reaching resident, refugee, and internally displaced children. Both governorates have completed rounds with more than 255 000 children reported vaccinated in Deir Ez-Zor and more than 140 000 reported vaccinated in Raqqa
- In addition to focused mOPV2 campaigns, a single dose of IPV has been offered to children 2-23 months in all districts of Deir Ez-Zor and Raqqa, except Tell Abyad district, Raqqa. Additional IPV immunization activities to boost the immunity of children aged between 2-23 months have been carried out in high risk areas of Aleppo, Idlib and Hama governorates
- Outbreak response teams are planning a 3rd mass immunization round to reach children under 5 with mOPV2 in areas where evidence of virus transmission continues.

Additional risk mitigation strategies
- Additional contingency planning is ongoing for potential breakthrough cases in known outbreak zones or spread of virus to new areas of the country. The plans aim to ensure that the programme is able to respond as quickly as possible if any further transmission of poliovirus is detected in Syria
- This includes the continued and strategic use of IPV in high risk communities, including those with large IDP populations from Deir Ez-Zor and pre-positioning of approximately one (1) million doses of mOPV2 in Damascus to enable rapid response in the event of any new detection of virus
- Efforts to further improve AFP surveillance sensitivity continue across the country. In addition to ongoing contact sampling from all AFP cases, stool samples are being taken from healthy children arriving from known infected areas as well as from silent districts, (districts that have not reported AFP cases in 2017) and active case searches in displaced camps continue
- Sub-National Immunization Days (SNIDs) aiming to reach children under 5 with bOPV started this week in areas of Rural Damascus, districts of Damascus, Homs, Aleppo, and accessible areas of Deir Ez-Zor city. Children aged 2-23 months will also be reached with supplementary IPV during the campaign.

Surveillance summary
- In 2017, Syria and all governorates but 4 are meeting both key indicators for AFP surveillance: 3* or more non-polio AFP cases per 100 000 children below 15 years of age, and 80 percent or above AFP cases with adequate specimens. Deir Ez-Zor (78%), Raqqa (70%), Rural Damascus (74%) and Swieda (63%) are missing the 80% target for stool adequacy. (*NB: In an outbreak setting, the target is 3 or more non-polio AFP cases per 100 000 children below 15 years.)
- The total number of AFP cases detected in Deir Ez-Zor governorate since the beginning of 2017 is 144 (107 from Mayadeen, 12 from Deir Ez-Zor, and 25 from Boukamal districts). Raqqa governorate has reported 22 AFP cases (10 from Raqqa, 10 from Tell Abyad, and 2 from Thawra districts). Homs governorate has reported 44 AFP cases (22 from Homs city, 19 from Rastan, 1 from Tadmour and 2 from Talkalakh districts)
- 6 polio-virus type-2 isolates are currently pending genomic sequencing
- Work continues to support the upgrade of laboratory facilities to enable more sophisticated techniques to be conducted in-country for the detection of poliovirus and the establishment of environmental surveillance.

[In summary, there have been 7 newly confirmed cases of cVDPV in Deir Ez-Zor governorate, bringing the total number of cVDPV associated paralytic cases in Syria to 70 with the "epicenter" of this outbreak being in Mayadeen district with 55 cases reported to date.

There are currently an additional 6 poliovirus type 2 isolates that are pending genomic sequencing that presumably will be identified as cVDPV's in the coming week(s). As the most recent date of onset of paralysis was 9 Sep 2017, it is quite possible that the cVDPV is still circulating in the affected areas.

Afghanistan: 4 new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples, 3 collected from Kandahar province, and 1 from Kabul province.
- Pakistan: 1 new WPV1 positive environmental sample, collected from Sindh province
- Syria: 7 new circulating vaccine derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases reported, all from Deir Ez-Zor governorate.

Afghanistan
- Four new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) positive environmental samples have been reported. Three samples were collected in Kandahar district, Kandahar province, and one sample was collected in Kabul district, Kabul province.
- No new WPV1 cases were reported this week. The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Afghanistan in 2017 remains 10.

Pakistan
- 1 new wild poliovirus 1 (WPV1) positive environmental sample was reported in the last week. The sample was collected in Karachi district, Sindh province.
- No new WPV1 cases have been reported. The total number of WPV1 cases in 2017 in Pakistan remains 5.
- A round of National Immunization Days (NIDs) are ongoing this week, aiming to reach about 37 million children aged less than 5 years across the country.

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2016 remains 4, and no cases have been reported in 2017. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] in Monguno Local Government Area, Borno.
- Nigeria continues to implement an emergency response to the detected WPV1 strain and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) strains affecting the country (last detected in 2016).
- Following the recently completed Outbreak Response Assessment (OBRA) in the country, the OBRA team continues to develop a detailed report of the findings. This will be submitted to the government of Nigeria and partners and will help inform a new plan of action for polio outbreak response in the coming months.
- Detection of polio cases in Nigeria underscores the risk posed by low-level undetected transmission. As part of the emergency response, subnational surveillance continues to be strengthened.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) (Borno state, Nigeria in 2016) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) (Borno and Sokoto states in 2016) continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These activities include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons camps, and at international borders.
- Following the recent Outbreak Response Assessments (OBRAs) undertaken in Lake Chad region countries, reports are being compiled that will help inform polio outbreak response over the coming months.

[Take away messages from the above reports:
- WPV1 is still circulating in Pakistan and Afghanistan as seen by the continued isolation of the virus in environmental samples in both countries.

- The isolation of a WPV1 in Kabul province may well be related to the newly reported case in Nangarhar province (see media report in section [1] above).

- Transmission of cVDPV2 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo may well have been interrupted as no new cases have been confirmed since July 2017.

- The cVDPV2 is still circulating in Syria as seen by the continued confirmation of cases after round 2 of the vaccination activities in the areas.
