Abstract
--------
Despite few human cases of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), high rates of TBEV seroprevalence were reported among humans and animals in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in Northwestern China. In this study, the Karshi virus (KSIV) was identified and isolated from _Hyalomma asiaticum_ ticks in Xinjiang. It belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae and is closely related to TBEV. KSIV infects cell lines from humans, other mammals and ticks, and causes encephalitis in suckling mice. High minimum infection rates (4.96%) with KSIV were detected among tick groups. KSIV infections have occurred in sheep and marmots, resulting in antibody-positive rates of 2.43 and 2.56%, respectively. We further found that, of the KSIV antibody-positive serum samples from animals, 13.9% had TBEV exposure showing cross-reaction to KSIV, and 11.1% had KSIV infection resulting in cross-reaction to TBEV; 8.3% were likely to have co-exposure to both viruses (or may be infected with one of them and present cross-reactivity with the other). The results revealed a substantial KSIV prevalence among ticks in Xinjiang, indicating exposure of animals to KSIV and TBEV. The findings implied misinterpretation of the high rates of TBEV seroprevalence among humans and animals in previous studies. There is a need to develop detection methods to distinguish KSIV from TBEV and to perform an in-depth investigation of KSIV and TBEV prevalence and incidence in Northwestern China, which would enhance our preparation to provide medical treatment of emerging diseases caused by tick-borne viral pathogens such as KSIV.

Discussion
----------
Karshi virus was first isolated from _Ornithodoros papillipes_ ticks collected in Uzbekistan in 1972 (Lvov et al., 1976), and subsequently from _Hy. asiaticum_ ticks collected in the north of Central Asia (Alma-Ata region of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic) in 1976 and from _Ornithodoros caniceps_ collected in Turkmenistan in 1978 (Khutoretskaya et al., 1985). In the present study, a strain of KSIV was isolated from _Hy. asiaticum_ ticks in Xinjiang, Northwestern China. Investigation of KSIV prevalence revealed that _Hy. detritum_, _Hy. asiaticum_ and _D. nuttalli_ ticks collected in Xinjiang could be the natural reservoirs of this virus, with the highest minimum infection rate (28.57%) among the _Hy. detritum_ groups, followed by the _Hy. asiaticum_ and _D. nuttalli_ groups. Although the rates could be affected by geographically limited sampling of ticks, which was performed mostly around the Tianshan Mountainous regions, the resulting minimum infection rates of 4.96% in total still suggested the substantial prevalence of KSIV in Xinjiang, especially around the pasture and farming areas relying on irrigation from the Tianshan Mountains. Moreover, KSIV was proved to be transmitted by _Ornithodoros_ ticks and was able to replicate in _ixodid_ ticks in laboratory experiments (Lvov et al., 1976; Aristova et al., 1986; Turell et al., 2004).

In summary, this study isolated a new KSIV strain and reported the prevalence of KSIV among ticks in Xinjiang, Northwestern China. KSIV was able to infect various cell lines from humans, animals and ticks, caused encephalitis in experimental mice (with pathogenesis similar to TBEV) and had low seroprevalence among marmots and sheep. All these findings suggested that KSIV is a potential pathogen with the ability to spill over from ticks and animal hosts to humans. This study further evaluated the serological cross-reactivity between KSIV and TBEV and found that KSIV and TBEV infection have both occurred among animals, which indicated that there has been misinterpretation of the high seroprevalence of TBEV among humans and animals in Xinjiang. The results of this study have improved our knowledge of the etiology and epidemiology of tick-borne flavivirus pathogens in Xinjiang. Moreover, the findings suggested the necessity to perform an extensive investigation of KSIV prevalence and incidence in Northwestern China, which may enhance our preparation to provide medical care against emerging diseases caused by tick-borne viral pathogens such as KSIV.

[As the authors point out, it is not yet clear if Karshi virus (KSIV) infections can cause disease in humans. The occurrence of antibodies in people indicate that exposure to this virus happens in nature. It will be important for laboratories to be able to differentiate between KSIV and tick-borne encephalitis virus infections in those areas where both viruses are transmitted in order to accurately determine the etiology of human and animal disease. - Mod.TY
