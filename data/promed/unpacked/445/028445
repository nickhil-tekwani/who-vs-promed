The [Wyoming, USA] state wildlife veterinarian told Wyoming Game and Fish commissioners that a vaccine to fight chronic wasting disease [CWD] appears to have failed in a test among live elk.

Dr. Mary Wood cautioned that her findings are preliminary, that they haven't been peer-reviewed or published, and that there is a hiccup in the study. Nevertheless, she said the live tests revealed a statistically significant difference showing the vaccine to be ineffective.

"We have not observed a protective effect associated with this vaccine," she stated in a PowerPoint presentation to the commission. "There may be a negative effect associated with this vaccine," she said, with inoculated elk about 7 times more likely to develop CWD.

13 surviving elk will continue to be studied in the test, she said. The trial also may help researchers better understand how genetic differences make some elk less susceptible, possibly immune, to the disease.

The news from Wood came as Game and Fish said it has found the incurable, always-fatal disease in several new deer hunt areas and a new elk hunting area. The new areas document the neurological disorder spreading farther west across the state. In 2014, Game and Fish discovered 83 mule deer, 12 white-tailed deer, and 15 elk that tested positive for CWD.

However, no elk have yet been found with CWD west of the Continental Divide where the state operates 22 winter elk feedgrounds. Some people are fearful the withering affliction would spread rapidly once it arrives where elk are concentrated artificially.

Wildlife managers hoped the vaccine might help contain CWD that's infected deer and elk across wide parts of eastern and central Wyoming. Made by the Canadian company Prevent, the recombinant protein fusion vaccine had shown potential. "They actually did some studies with domestic sheep and [deer-family] cervids," Wood told the commission. "It looked very promising. They had thought this vaccine might either protect against actual infection of CWD or potentially it might prolong survival."

But now, almost 3 years after the trial on 38 elk started at the agency's Tom Thorne and Beth Williams Wildlife Research Center, the results show otherwise. "I don't have the greatest news to give you today," Wood told the commission 6 Nov 2015. "I have not found the magic bullet to treat CWD."

Chronic wasting disease is a malady akin to mad-cow disease in cattle and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. It causes neurological degeneration, but there's no documentation of it spreading from animals to humans. Protein-based infectious agents called prions cause the disease.

In the research setting, infected elk 1st begin showing changes to their temperament. They appear dull and lose general awareness. They begin to waste, drool, don't shed winter coats, and start to shake.

Wood showed slides and videos of infected elk, warning commissioners that they were difficult to see and watch. "This really is an ugly disease," she said.

Regardless of the preliminary findings, there are no immediate plans to change the state's strategy regarding CWD. Today, that includes testing of hunter-killed animals along the advancing front of the disease. Sick and dying animals that are euthanized also are tested. The effort involves a separate surveillance drive in the Jackson Hole area where lymph nodes of many hunter-killed elk are collected and analyzed.

Also, on some of the state's 22 feedgrounds, Game and Fish workers practice low-density feeding in an effort to reduce the spread of diseases. Game and Fish will be proposing an update of its CWD strategy later this year, Chief Game Warden Brian Nesvik said. When it is released for public review, it likely will include a call for removal and incineration of any carcasses on feedgrounds or any carcass of any animal that tests positive, Nesvik said.

The news about the vaccine reinforces calls for predators to play a larger role in the ecosystem and for an end to supplemental winter feeding, said Lloyd Dorsey, conservation director for the Wyoming chapter of Sierra Club in Jackson.

"We do have tools at hand to address this disease, this enormous threat to our big-game herds," he said. "That is the conservation of predators. Increasing the number of predators would better insure the health of those deer and elk herds."

[It is sad to learn that the vaccine was not protective and may even have provided a negative effect in the animals. The article says there were other cervid trials but I don't see results there. Hopefully other species of cervids will find this vaccine more protective. - Mod.TG]
