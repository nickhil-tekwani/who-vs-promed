The Health Ministry yesterday [21 Feb 2011] requested flood victims
suffering from fever to seek immediate medical treatment. A Ministry
spokesman said 2 persons from Anuradhapura [North Central province]
had died from rat fever (leptospirosis) and 50 others are receiving
treatment.

According to the spokesman out of 7 persons who died from fever in
the Anuradhapura hospital recently, 2 had died from rat fever. Blood
samples of others are being tested at the Medical Research Institute
(MRI).

The Health Ministry yesterday sent a special team to Anuradhapura to
probe the deaths of 7 persons who were suspected of having
leptospirosis symptoms.

Vulnerable people, especially farmers should contact the PHI [public
health inspector] or MOH and obtain doxycycline tablets. They should
take 2 tablets before they start work.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by the spirochete _Leptospira_.
This disease characteristically occurs during periods of flooding and
is endemic in Sri Lanka. For a discussion of leptospirosis, see the
prior ProMED-mail post Leptospirosis - Australia: (QL) alert
20110121.0246.

Doxycycline in a single 200 mg oral dose, (or weekly, in cases of
prolonged exposure) has been used to prevent leptospirosis in exposed
persons. The single dose of doxycycline is thought to provide
protection for about a week. However, different clinical trials to
assess the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis of leptospirosis have had
conflicting results
(<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol9no6/02-0751.htm>,
<http://www.wiziq.com/tutorial/40553-Doxycycline-chemoprophylaxis-for-leptospirosis-a-brief-review>).

The results of one randomized placebo-controlled trial study
indicated that doxycycline prophylaxis did not prevent leptospiral
infection in an endemic area during a seasonal outbreak, but had a
significant protective effect in reducing the morbidity and mortality
(<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10755239>). Another randomized
placebo-controlled study of US soldiers training in Panama
demonstrated a 95 percent protective efficacy with a weekly dose of
200 mg doxycycline for 3 weeks, compared to placebo (Takafuji ET et
al: An efficacy trial of doxycycline chemoprophylaxis against
leptospirosis. N Engl J Med. 1984; 310(8): 497-500; abstract available
at <http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805>). A
Cochrane review of clinical research testing whether taking
doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis found that data from trials,
which "targeted different kinds of people -- travellers and people who
live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students",
"did not support the practice in all cases, though short term
travellers with a potential for high risk exposure may be helped."
(<http://www.thecochranelibrary.com/userfiles/ccoch/file/Water%20safety/CD007342.pdf>).

The Anuradhapura District, located in north-central Sri Lanka, with a
population in 2001 of 745 693, is one of 2 districts in the North
Central Province of Sri Lanka
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Central_Province,_Sri_Lanka>).
The city of Anuradhapura, the capital of the North Central Province,
is one of the ancient capitals of Sri Lanka and is famous for its
well-preserved ruins of ancient Lankan civilization
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anuradhapura>). The city lies on the
banks of the Malwatu Oya River, which flooded with the release of
water from 2 reservoirs, Nuwara wewa and Tissa wewa. The reservoirs
were constructed by the city's ancient rulers to irrigate paddy lands
and also to supply water to the city
(<http://srilanka.travel-culture.com/anuradhpura.shtml>). For a map of
the city, see <http://iguide.travel/Anuradhapura/Eating#/Map>.

The flooding, due to torrential rains that began in January 2011 in
Sri Lanka's North Central and Eastern provinces, displaced almost a
million people, and caused widespread devastation
(<http://makanaka.wordpress.com/2011/02/13/sri-lanka-floods-we-dont-have-a-harvest/>,
