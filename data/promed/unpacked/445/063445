After eating canned mushrooms of domestic preparation, 5 inhabitants
of the Tambov region have fallen ill with botulism. The incident has
been reported in the village of Kulichevka in the district of
Inzhavinskiy, according to Sergey Zotov, the deputy chief of the
department of sanitary inspection of the territorial management of
Rospotrebnadzor (Federal Service on Surveillance of Consumer Rights
and Human Well-being) in the Tambov region.
These are the 1st cases of botulism in 2006. Among those affected are
2 local inhabitants and their relatives who were visiting from Moscow
and Voronezh.
The implicated mushrooms, _Lepista nuda_, were collected and
preserved in 2005. The [day after consuming the mushrooms], those
affected became ill with weakness, vomiting, and diarrhea. The
patients did not seek medical attention on the 1st day and [instead
treated themselves]. When the visitors from Moscow returned home,
[they sought] medical aid. Doctors in Tambov have taken measures to
identify other victims after physicians from Moscow sent them
information about cases of botulism.
Now 6 more inhabitants of the village of Kulichevka are [under
observation by] infectious disease physicians, including 3 children
under 14 years old; 4 more victims are undergoing treatment in
clinics in Moscow, Voronezh, and Tambov.
