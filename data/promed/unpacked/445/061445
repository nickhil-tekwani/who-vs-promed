If you're planning to eat walrus meat this summer, first ask the harvester if the meat has been tested. That's because walrus meat hunted earlier this month [August 2016] near Naujaat [Kivalliq Region of Nunavut] recently tested positive for the trichinella parasite, the Government of Nunavut's [GN] health department said [on 26 Aug 2016].

In Arctic regions, trichinella -- known as trichinosis or trichinellosis in an infected person -- is caused by a microscopic parasite called _Trichinella nativa_, sometimes found in the meat of wild mammals such as polar bears, wolves, foxes and, most commonly, walruses.

The disease can develop after eating uncooked meat from an infected animal. Health officials said the walrus that tested positive for the parasite was harvested on [10 Aug 2016]. Nunavummiut who have recently eaten any uncooked walrus meat should keep an eye out for the following symptoms of being infected with trichinella: stomach pain, muscle pain, diarrhea, swollen eyelids, sweating, and weakness.

Anyone experiencing those symptoms should visit their local health centre, the GN said. Walrus meat should be thoroughly cooked before it's consumed to prevent the spread of the infection, health officials said, warning that freezing or fermenting the meat does not kill trichinella.

No deaths related to trichinella have been reported in the territory since 2008, when an Arctic Bay man died after eating fermented walrus meat infected with trichinella worms. In 2015, wildlife harvested near 3 Nunavut communities tested positive for trichinella -- walrus meat near Sanikiluaq and Rankin Inlet, and polar meat harvested near Clyde River.

It is well know that walrus often are infected with trichinella. Walrus eat carcasses floating in the water and seals which may also be infected with _Trichinella_ spp. (Møller LN. Epidemiology of _Trichinella_ in Greenland--occurrence in animals and man.

Int J Parasitol. 2003; 33(13): 1463-70; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14572509). Human trichinellosis has also been described in Greenland after eating raw walrus ( Møller LN, et al. Outbreak of trichinellosis associated with consumption of game meat in West Greenland. Vet Parasitol. 2005; 132(1-2): 131-6; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16023294). - Mod.EP]
