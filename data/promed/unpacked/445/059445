Organic poultry farms locked in Germany and the Netherlands
-----------------------------------------------------------
Dutch and German organic poultry farms are locked because of dioxin
contamination in animal feed, according to German and Dutch
authorities. It involves 8 farms in the Netherlands and 19 farms in
Germany that cannot sell their eggs for at least a week.

The dioxin infection has been caused by contaminated corn from the
Ukraine. The grains have been processed in organic poultry feed by
several feed companies, which in turn supplied the feed to several
German layer farms.

According to TrusQ, a cooperation between feed manufacturers in the
field of food safety, the damage could be several hundred-thousands Euros.

EFSA publishes European overview of dioxin levels in food and feed
------------------------------------------------------------------
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has published an analysis
of the levels of dioxins and related substances in food and animal
feed. The report, which was prepared by EFSA's Data Collection and
Exposure unit, is based on more than 7000 samples collected by 21
European countries between 1999 and 2008. EFSA was asked by the
European Commission to evaluate dioxin contamination levels in
relation to maximum levels which have been set for different
categories of food and feed in the EU in order to protect consumers.

Dioxins and similar compounds, such as dioxin-like polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs), include a range of toxic substances which are
formed by burning -- e.g., through waste incineration or forest fires
-- and some industrial processes. Their presence in the environment
has declined since the 1970s, following concerted efforts at the EU level.

Dioxins are found at low levels in many foods. They do not cause
immediate health problems, but long-term exposure to high levels of
dioxins has been shown to cause a range of effects, including cancer.
Their persistence and the fact that they accumulate in the food
chain, notably in animal fat, therefore continues to cause some
safety concerns.

The highest average levels of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in
relation to fat content were observed for liver and liver products
from animals. The highest average levels in relation to total product
weight were for fish liver and products derived from fish liver. In
animal feed, the highest average levels were found in fish oil.

Overall, 8 percent of the samples exceeded the different maximum
levels set out in EU legislation. However, some of these samples
clearly originated from targeted sampling during specific
contamination episodes. There were also large variations between
different groups of food and feed in terms of the proportion of
samples which exceed maximum levels.

The report concludes that no clear trend can be established regarding
changes in background levels of dioxins and related substances in
food and feed over time, as there were increases in some categories
but decreases in others. Furthermore, occasional contamination
episodes and a lack of information on which samples resulted from
targeted or random sampling make it difficult to assess such trends.

The current EU method for measuring overall dioxin levels is based on
toxicity values for different types of dioxins recommended by the
World Health Organisation (WHO) in 1998. EFSA was also asked to
assess the impact on total dioxin levels of using toxicity values set
out in WHO recommendations from 2005, which downgraded the relative
toxicity of certain types of dioxins. The report finds that using the
new values would reduce overall dioxin levels by 14 percent, although
the extent of this reduction was very different across food and feed
categories.

Finally, the report recommends continuous random testing of a
sufficient number of samples in each food and feed group to ensure
accurate assessments of the presence of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs.

[Apparently, the high dioxin levels in the organic table-eggs should
not surprise: research among layer farms in the Netherlands and other
EU countries has shown that organic eggs contain more dioxin than
conventional ones and that a significant number of organic farms
produce eggs with a dioxin content that exceeds the EU standard. The
EU requirements for maximum dioxins level in hen eggs and egg
products is 3,0 pg/g (=PPT) of fat (about 2 pg/g in whole egg). For
further background see ref 1 at
<http://library.wur.nl/ojs/index.php/njas/article/viewFile/1161/739>. - Mod.AS]

Ref 1.
M. De Vries, R.P. Kwakkel and A. Kijlstra (2006). Dioxins in organic
eggs: a review. Wageningen Journal of Life Sciences (NJAS) 54-2, 207 - 221.

[While parts per trillion is not an alarming amount and may well be
below the accepted standard, the question is, "How much is in the
eggs that is preventing them from being sold?" While the source may
be the contaminated grain, what is the source that contaminated the
grain and what procedures have been put into place to insure the corn
does not continue to be contaminated? How high were the levels of
dioxin in the grain? Was there any PCB in the grain?

Without knowing the amount of dioxin in the eggs, we do not know if a
week is sufficient time to withhold the sale of the eggs. What kind
of testing is planned for the chicken carcass when the layer has
reached the end of her laying life?

While it seems there is notification of a stop sale for the eggs, it
seems there are many more questions that need answers in order to do
a risk assessment or to insure that this situation is not repeated
the near future, for example when the next load of grain arrives. - Mod.TG]
