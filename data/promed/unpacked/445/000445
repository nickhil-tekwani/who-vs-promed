I write regarding a 3 Feb 2008 ProMED release on Panama disease in
China [see ProMED-mail post no. 20080203.0440]. The outbreak is
caused by tropical race 4 (TR4) and is devastating Cavendish
production throughout the indicated areas in China [Fujian Province]
as well as elsewhere in Southeast Asia. TR4 continues to spread in
the region and represents a serious threat to production in the
Americas and Africa. About 85 percent of the annual global production
of banana comes from cultivars that are susceptible to TR4.
