A 25 year old Egyptian woman has died of the H5N1 bird flu virus, the 25th
human fatality of the disease in Egypt, state news agency MENA said on
Wednesday [22 Apr 2009]. The woman, from Cairo, died of respiratory
failure, MENA reported. [See ProMED-mail posting Avian influenza, human
(76): Egypt (Cairo) 20090418.1472].

On Tuesday [21 Apr 2009] MENA reported a 6 year old boy had died from the
disease. He resided in Qalyubia [governorate] and was Egypt's 1st bird flu
fatality of 2009, MENA quoted a health ministry spokesman as saying. The
boy had been admitted to hospital in late March [2009]. [See ProMED-mail
posting Avian influenza, human (79): Egypt, 67th case 20090422.1517].

A 4 year old boy from Sohag [governorate] has contracted bird flu and was
in hospital. The boy was being treated with the antiviral drug Tamiflu. His
infection brought to 67 the number of bird flu cases in humans in the most
populous Arab country, which has been hit harder by bird flu than any other
country outside Asia. [See ProMED-mal posting Avian influenza, human (79):
Egypt, 67th case 20090422.1517].

Egypt has seen a surge in human cases in recent months, with 16 confirmed
since the start of the year [2009], compared to 7 cases between 1 Jan and
17 Apr last year [2008]. Most infected Egyptians had come into contact with
infected domestic birds in a country where roughly 5 million households
depend on domestically raised poultry as a significant source of food and
income. The World Health Organisation said this month [April 2009] it was
concerned some Egyptians may carry the bird flu virus without showing
symptoms and this could give the virus more of a chance to mutate to a
strain that spreads easily among humans.

[This is the 2nd fatality among the 16 cases recorded in Egypt since the
beginning of 2009. These 2 fatalities weaken the argument that the 2009
outbreak virus may be less virulent (and as a consequence more
transmissible) than the virus circulating in previous years when there were
higher mortalities. - Mod.CP]
