The FDA is warning consumers about a potential _Clostridium
botulinum_ (_C. botulinum_) contamination of canned cut green beans
manufactured by New Era Canning Company, New Era, MI, and labeled as
"GFS Fancy Blue Lake Cut Green Beans." _C. botulinum_ is the
bacterium that causes botulism.

The canned cut green beans were distributed to retailers, restaurants
and food service institutions by Gordon Food Service, Grand Rapids,
MI, with lot code 19H7FL and UPC code 93901 11873, in large
institutional-sized, 6 pound 5 ounce (No. 10) cans. The green beans
were distributed to food service customers in Alabama, Arkansas,
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, North
Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia and sold through GFS Marketplace
stores in Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee. There is no evidence of
primary distribution outside the USA.

Customers who have the affected cans of cut green beans or who have
used the green beans in recipes should throw cans and food away
immediately. Any food that may be contaminated should be disposed of
carefully. Even tiny amounts of the _C. botulinum_ toxin ingested,
inhaled, or absorbed through the eye or a break in the skin can cause
serious illness. Skin contact should be avoided as much as possible,
and the hands should be washed immediately after handling the food.

When disposing of this product, double-bag the cans in plastic bags.
Make sure the bags are tightly closed, then place in a trash
receptacle for non-recyclable trash outside of the home. Restaurants
and institutions should ensure that such products are only placed in
locked receptacles that are not accessible to the public. Additional
instructions for safe disposal may be found at
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/botulism_g.htm>.

As part of this ongoing investigation, the FDA is working closely
with Michigan Department of Agriculture state officials and New Era
to identify all products that may be involved. The Michigan
Department of Agriculture, under its state authority, seized most
canned products in the company's warehouses. New Era is voluntarily
recalling 171 cases of the green beans (6 cans per case).

The FDA learned of the potential contamination on 20 Dec 2007, when
testing of product collected during an FDA inspection showed a
presumptive positive result for _C. botulinum_. This incident
illustrates the important health protection role that FDA inspections
play and the need for firms to have adequate preventive control
systems in place.

[As noted in previous postings regarding botulism recalls, most of
the food recalls are related to defective preparation procedures,
which could, but not necessarily do, result in the germination of
viable spores of _C. botulinum_. This follow-up posting gives
specific information on the identification of _C. botulinum_ spores
in the product. Hence, it is now apparent that this product did
indeed have relevant contamination with _C. botulinum_ spores of at
least 1 of the neurotoxin types. - Mods.LL/MPP]
