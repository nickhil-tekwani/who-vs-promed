White-tailed deer are collapsing dead on fairways at the city's Deer Run
golf course, and state wildlife biologists blame a common viral disease
spread by gnats. The disease is Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease (EHD). City
parks officials attribute the deaths of more than 40 deer since 17 Aug 2002
at Newport News Park to EHD, a fairly common deer disease most prevalent in
the late summer and early fall. Outbreaks usually end when frost and cold
temperatures kill the disease-carrying gnats.
Between 600 and 700 deer roam the 8000-acre park in the city's northern
end, said Michael Poplawski, the city's parks administrator. Rangers
typically find 1 or 2 dead deer a month, with the cause of death often tied
to car crashes.
Experts say an outbreak of EHD could infect as many as one in 4 deer in a
herd, but parks officials figure the outbreak here is much less severe. At
this time, the outbreak appears limited to the park.
The disease causes internal bleeding and high fevers, according to the
state Department of Game and Inland Fisheries. It can result in death
within 48 hours of infection. No medication or vaccination exists to cure
the disease. It poses no threat to humans or domesticated animals, such as
cats and dogs.
More widespread outbreaks have occurred in the Piedmont area of the state,
such as around Lynchburg and Bedford, said Phil West, state wildlife
biologist. Some cases have been reported in Williamsburg and Gloucester,
James City and Middlesex counties. "Not tremendous numbers," he said. "A
deer here and there."
Poplawski said city officials are unaware of any previous outbreak at
Newport News Park. He hopes the outbreak has peaked since rangers are
finding fewer and older carcasses recently.
West awaits official confirmation of the disease from tissue samples sent
to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study in Athens, Georgia.
Results could be available within a couple of weeks. But he said a field
study pinpointed the hemorrhagic disease.
Park rangers have found carcasses beside the park's lake and swamp, a sign
the deer died trying to quench the thirst of a high fever. Also, infected
carcasses are healthy except for mouth ulcers and, occasionally, lost
hooves. Not all infected deer die, West said.
Poplawski said the ravages of the disease have startled some golfers at the
city's golf course.
"Here's what appears to be a normal deer," he said, "that starts to walk
erratically, looks depressed or stumbles and falls."

A disease spread by gnats is suspected of killing as many as 200
white-tailed deer in southeast Ohio.
It is believed the deer died of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD), a
common disease of deer in the eastern United States, said spokesman Andy
Ware of the Ohio Division of Natural Resources.
Tests were being conducted by the Ohio Department of Agriculture with
results expected next week.
The problem is centered in Salem Township in Meigs County with small areas
of neighboring Gallia and Vinton counties also affected, Ware said.
If confirmed, the deaths would mark the first time that the disease has
been found in Ohio, Ware said.
It may have occurred in Muskingum County in 1980 and in Greene County in
1997, but those cases were not confirmed, he said.
In deer, the virus can cause spontaneous hemorrhaging in muscles and organs
about 5 to 10 days after a deer is infected. Deer initially lose their
appetite and their fear of humans, grow progressively weaker, often
salivate excessively, appear to be out of breath and become unconscious.
Many infected deer die within 36 hours of the onset of signs.
The disease is not a threat to humans and does not affect the safety of the
venison, wildlife officials said.
The outbreak of the disease should not affect hunting in the 3 counties,
Ware said. Hunters are generally advised not to consume animals that do not
appear to be healthy and they are asked to report any sick animals to local
wildlife officers, he said. The first dead deer was reported 31Aug 2002.
State wildlife officials said there's a high risk for more deer becoming
infected with the virus because of the dry weather in southern Ohio. That
is forcing deer to congregate near remaining water sources, where the gnats
or midges live. The disease could spread until a frost kills the gnats.
The state is monitoring the outbreak, but there's nothing state personnel
can do to help the deer, Ware said.

[Epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) is an acute, infectious, often fatal
viral disease of some wild ruminants. This malady, characterized by
extensive hemorrhages, has been responsible for significant epizootics in
deer in the northern United States and southern Canada. A similar
hemorrhagic disease called bluetongue also occurs in wild ruminants. The 2
diseases are antigenically different, although there are similar clinical
signs.
The first occurrence and subsequent identification of EHD occurred in 1955
when several hundred white-tailed deer (_Odocoileus virginianus_) succumbed
in both New Jersey and in Michigan. It was considered a new disease of deer
and the name "epizootic hemorrhagic disease" was suggested to describe its
main clinical and pathological features.
Since these initial confirmed outbreaks of EHD, documented epizootics have
occurred in white-tailed deer in South Dakota, North Dakota, Wyoming, and
Alberta, Canada. Suspected EHD outbreaks have occurred in Missouri,
Washington, Nebraska, Iowa, and British Columbia. South Dakota, Missouri,
and Nebraska have experienced periodic outbreaks of EHD, and the disease
might be considered enzootic in these areas.
Since the initial 1955 outbreak, this malady has occurred primarily among
white-tailed deer, although occasionally mule deer (_O. hemionus_) and
pronghorn antelope (_Antilocapra americana_) have succumbed.
The mode of transmission of EHD in nature is via a _Culicoides_ biting fly
or gnat. _Culicoides variipennis_ is the most commonly incriminated vector
in North America. A common observation in outbreaks involving large numbers
of deer (as in Michigan, New Jersey and Alberta) is that they are single
epizootics that do not recur. Die-offs involving small numbers of deer (as
experienced in South Dakota and Nebraska) occur almost annually, and the
disease appears to be enzootic in these areas. All documented outbreaks of
EHD have occurred during late summer and early fall (August-October) and
have ceased abruptly with the onset of frost.
Clinical signs of EHD and bluetongue are similar. White-tailed deer develop
signs of illness about 7 days after exposure. A constant characteristic of
the disease is its sudden onset. Deer initially lose their appetite and
fear of man, grow progressively weaker, often salivate excessively, develop
a rapid pulse and respiration rate, and finally become unconscious.
Hemorrhage and lack of oxygen in the blood result in a blue appearance of
the oral mucosa, hence the name "bluetongue". Between 8 and 36 hours
following the onset of observable signs, deer pass into a shock-like state,
become prostrate, and die.
The gross and histological lesions of EHD are characterized by extensive
hemorrhage, ranging from pin-point to massive in size, and involve
different tissues and organs in individual animals. No organs appear to be
exempt from hemorrhage, with the most regularly involved being the heart,
liver, spleen, kidney, lung, and intestinal tract. Extensive hemorrhaging
is the result of interference with the blood-clotting mechanism together
with degeneration of blood vessel walls.
Because of its very high mortality rate, EHD can have a significant effect
upon the deer population in a given area, reducing numbers drastically.
Hemorrhagic disease can be transmitted to other wild ruminants. The EHD
virus can infect domestic animals but rarely causes disease. In all
probability the virus does not infect humans. Presently there is no
evidence that crosses into humans. (Portions extracted from Roselake
