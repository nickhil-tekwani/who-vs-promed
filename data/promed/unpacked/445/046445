Health officials are looking for the person who dropped off a one to 2-year-old dark gray pit bull dog at the Palm City Humane Society outdoor kennel last week out of concern about possible rabies exposure.

According to the Florida Department of Health, the Humane Society contacted it on 30 Jun 2016 when the dog became highly aggressive and began foaming at the mouth. The shelter contacted Martin County Animal Control Services for guidance and determined that the dog needed to be euthanized.

The Health Department sent samples for rabies testing. Test results were not conclusive, but officials are asking anyone who came in contact with the dog to come forward and provide information. The dog is described as a dark gray, 1-to-2-year-old, un-spayed female pit bull. No microchip was found on the dog. Anyone with information about the dog is asked to contact the Florida Department of Health at 772-221-4090.

The Florida Department of Health reminds residents to make sure pets are up to date with their rabies vaccinations, don't feed or handle wild animals, and call animal control if they see an animal acting strangely. If you get bitten by an animal, wash the wound with soap and water for at least 5 minutes and see a doctor. If you see a dead animal, use gloves to remove and dispose of the animal properly [or put your hand inside a plastic bag, grab the carcass, and invert the bag to cover the body. - Mod.MHJ].

[2] Maryland (Worcester County): feral cat,

After a rabid cat was found in a West Ocean City townhome community back in June 2016, officials say 3 people are being treated for rabies exposure.

The Worcester County Sheriff's Office says after a wild feral cat from a colony of wild feral cats tested positive for rabies, 3 people were found to have been exposed and are now undergoing treatment. Worcester County Animal Control says they have been working to protect the community by removing other wild animals that have been exposed to the deadly rabies disease in order to reduce the risk to the community.

Officials are reminding residents that trying to approach, contact, or feed wild animals is dangerous to humans and that this includes feral cats. Leaving food out for feral cats or any other wild animal will invite the risk of potential exposure to humans to a deadly disease, according to officials.

The Sheriff's Office said in a release on Thursday [7 Jul 2016]: "Rabid animals exhibit many different symptoms of the disease. The disease can incubate in an animal for about 6 months or longer. There is no way of knowing how many animals have been exposed to the disease, therefore it would be in the best interest of the community not to attempt to approach any wild feral cat or any other wild animal."

Officials say that cases of rabies have been confirmed in several different species of wild animals in Worcester County. The Berlin Police Department said on their Facebook page that there have been 5 investigations of rabies in Berlin, with 2 testing positive. The cases reportedly involved 3 raccoons, 2 groundhogs, and a fox.

For more information about the risks and symptoms of rabies, please contact the Worcester County Animal Control at 410-632-1340 and or the Worcester County Health Department at 410-641-9559 or visit their website (http://worcesterhealth.org/protect-menu/rabies-exposures-and-animal-bite-investigationsservicesmenu).

The State Public Health Lab in Raleigh today [7 Jul 2016] reported a positive rabies result in a kitten from Cumberland County. It was the 5th positive case in the county this year [2016].

Animal Control picked up a kitten Wednesday [6 Jul 2016] at the Animal Hospital of Fayetteville on Fort Bragg Road. The kitten, approximately 4 months old, got into an alteration with an unknown animal sometime around 25 May 2016. The owner took the kitten to the Animal Hospital of Fayetteville for treatment of bite wounds to the rear limb and a fractured tibia. Veterinarian staff reported that neurological symptoms appeared Monday or Tuesday [4-5 Jul 2016].

The kitten's owner resides on Pecan Drive, off McPherson Avenue, in Fayetteville. Animal Control has notified 8 people that they must receive rabies post-exposure treatment. The owner and 3 employees of the animal hospital were bitten or scratched. Two other employees, the owner's roommate, and a friend also handled the cat.

If I were to guess, the kitten fought and survived an encounter with a rabid raccoon. If it had been a fox or dog, it would have been killed.

The Florida Dept. of Health has a number of useful webpages with information on rabies for professionals: http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/rabies/professionals.html. Also see rabies surveillance data and maps at http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/rabies/rabies-surveillance.html, including a very nice map of cases by county from 1 Jan-30 Jun 2016. The disease is truly widespread in space and species in this state.

Ocean City is properly described, as it is on the Atlantic coast; see http://www.fallingrain.com/world/US/MD/Ocean_City.html. Rabies is a regular event in Worcester County, MD, and minimally raccoon rabies forms 66% to over 90% of known cases. While raccoons make up the vast majority of confirmed rabid animals in Worcester County (and in Maryland), other species are also infected. Many people are not aware that the most frequent domestic animals to contract rabies are cats. Many of these confirmed rabid animals, as well as many other suspect animals that were not possible to be tested, had had contact with pets or people. It is extremely important that pets' rabies vaccinations stay current and that these encounters are reported so that testing and proper rabies risk assessments can be made for the people and pets involved. - Mod.MHJ
