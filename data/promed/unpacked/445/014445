UNICEF said yesterday in Kinshasa that the death toll from cholera in DR
Congo had jumped from 30 to 211 in just four days. As in earlier reports,
a majority of the victims are young children and adolescents and the
epidemic is still centered in Kisangani (eastern part of the country).
Various medical aid organizations are providing relief assistance. The
Dutch wing of MSF (Doctors without Borders) has established an isolation
facility in Kisangani.
