The Bay County Health Department received 3 reports of infection from
_Vibrio vulnificus_ within the last week. This bacterium is occurring
naturally in saltwater and is most commonly contracted by eating raw
shellfish, according to a health department news release. The 3
people with cases reported within the last week told officials they
ate raw oysters prior to becoming ill, the news release stated.
The infection may cause only mild illness in healthy people, but it
can cause serious or even fatal illness in persons with liver
disease, diabetes, HIV, or other illnesses that compromise the immune
system, health officials said.
People can prevent becoming infected by not eating raw shellfish or
cooking shellfish thoroughly prior to cooking.

[The lack of mortality in these 3 cases suggests that the cases
occurred in individuals without a depressed immune system.

is number 3 on the map located on the Florida "panhandle" area and
Pinellas County is number 52 in the west-central part of the state.

As the Gulf of Mexico gets warmer, some people are more at risk from
eating raw oysters. Jeannine Mallory with the Pinellas County Health
Department says an elderly woman died in April 2007 from eating raw
oysters.
Mallory says people with liver damage, diabetes, cancer, stomach
disorders, and a weakened immune system are most at risk from a
bacterium called _Vibrio vulnificus_, which grows in salt water.
"What people need to know is that wherever you go if you have a
health condition that puts you at risk, consuming raw oysters is
probably not a good thing for you to do," said Mallory.

[It is not stated in this posting how the infection presented in this
woman and what underlying risk factors she may have had.
The following is excerpted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Food
Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA at:
<http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~mow/chap10.html>
_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative,
opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and
associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish
(oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors
responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and
in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of
dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water and
acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not
imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.
Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with
sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body
on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism.
The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in
gastroenteritis. The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows
consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals
with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The
organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals,
the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock,
rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70
percent of infected individuals have distinctive bulbous skin lesions
(shown at <http://safeoysters.org/medical/sym_2_photo.jpg>). - Mod.LL]
