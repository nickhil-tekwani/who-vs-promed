Four California horses have tested positive for West Nile virus (WNV), the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) reported. These bring the total number of confirmed equine WNV cases in California to 5 for 2018.

"On 16 Aug 2018, 4 horses displaying neurologic signs were confirmed positive for West Nile virus," the CDFA said.

Those cases include:
*A 9-year-old vaccinated Quarter Horse mare in Sacramento County;
*A 3-year-old unvaccinated Andalusian mare in Kern County;
*A 6-year-old vaccinated Quarter Horse gelding in Placer County; and
*An 8-year-old unvaccinated Hanoverian mare in Sacramento County.

"Due to the severity of neurologic signs, the 9-year-old Quarter Horse mare in Sacramento and the 3-year-old Andalusian mare in Kern County were euthanized," the CDFA said. "The other 2 horses are alive and receiving veterinary care."

California's other WNV case was confirmed in an unvaccinated Shasta County horse. That animal did not survive.

"CDFA continually monitors and investigates equine neurologic cases for the presence of WNV in California," the agency said. "CDFA urges horse owners to consult their veterinarian concerning a WNV vaccination program to ensure maximum protection of their horses."

West Nile virus is transmitted to horses via bites from infected mosquitoes. Not all infected horses show clinical signs, but those that do can exhibit:

**Flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed;
**Fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculation (twitching);
**Hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound);
**Changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they're daydreaming or "just not with it;"
**Occasional drowsiness;
**Propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and
**Spinal signs, including asymmetrical weakness; and
**Asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia (incoordination).
**West Nile has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care.
**Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40%.

Studies have shown that vaccines can be effective WNV prevention tools. Horses vaccinated in past years need an annual booster shot, but veterinarians might recommend 2 boosters annually -- one in the spring and another in the fall -- in areas with prolonged mosquito seasons. In contrast, previously unvaccinated horses require a 2-shot vaccination series in a 3- to 6-week period. Full immunity takes several weeks to achieve.

In addition to vaccinations, owners should work to reduce mosquito population and breeding areas and limit horses' mosquito exposure by:

**Removing stagnant water sources;
**Dumping, cleaning, and refilling water buckets and troughs regularly;
**Keeping animals inside during the bugs' feeding times (typically early in the morning and evening); and
**Applying mosquito repellents approved for equine use.

A horse infected with the West Nile virus had to be put down, and the 1st 3 cases of the virus in humans in Massachusetts this year [2018] were identified, state officials said Friday [24 Aug 2018].

The horse was stabled in Hampshire County, "became severely ill, and had to be euthanized," a press release from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health said.

A woman in her 70s from Worcester County was hospitalized with symptoms from the virus but has since been discharged, the press release said.

A woman in her 60s from Middlesex County was not hospitalized during her illness, the press release said.

A Suffolk County woman in her 50s was hospitalized but has been discharged, the press release said.

The state limits identifying information about human and animal cases of West Nile virus only to the county where they reside, said Ann Scales, Department of Public Health spokeswoman.

"August and September are the months when we typically see more human cases, because it is the beginning of the peak season for possible West Nile virus human infections," said Dr. Catherine Brown, state epidemiologist.

There are 94 Massachusetts towns and cities where WNV mosquitoes have been found in 2018. Officials have detected mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus in dozens of Massachusetts communities.

"These new human cases illustrate why we informed people about the increased risk for human infections earlier this week," Brown said.

In 2017, there were 6 human cases of WNV infection identified in Massachusetts.

West Nile virus is a mosquito-carried virus that can cause illness ranging from a mild fever to more serious disease like encephalitis or meningitis. It was 1st identified in the United States in 1999.

The world has 3000 species of mosquito, and they transmit more diseases than any other creature, according to National Geographic.

West Nile virus can infect people of all ages, though people over the age of 50 are at higher risk for severe disease. Most people infected with the virus have no symptoms, the press release said.

Virus symptoms tend to include fever and flu-like illness [in people], the press release said.

"There has been an increase in WNV-infected mosquitoes identified this year [2018] throughout the state, an indication that the risk is widespread and ongoing," said Monica Bharel, commissioner with the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.

"That means this year [2018], it is extremely important for people to take steps to avoid mosquito bites, including using repellents, wearing clothing to reduce exposed skin, dumping standing water, and moving indoors when you notice mosquitoes biting you."

The Department of Public Health Tuesday [21 Aug 2018] raised the risk level for West Nile virus to moderate from low in every Massachusetts city and town, the press release said.

Among steps people can take to avoid illnesses from mosquito bites are, said the Department of Public Health:

- to avoid mosquito bites by applying insect repellant when outdoors. Use a repellent with DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), permethrin, picaridin (KBR 3023), oil of lemon eucalyptus [p-methane 3, 8-diol (PMD)], or IR3535 according to the instructions on the product label. DEET products should not be used on infants under 2 months of age and should be used in concentrations of 30 percent less on older children. Oil of lemon eucalyptus should not be used on children under 3 years of age;
- to be aware of peak mosquito hours, which are between dusk to dawn. Consider rescheduling outdoor activities;
- to wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks outside to help in blocking mosquitoes from your skin;
- to mosquito-proof your home by draining standing water, which is where mosquitoes lay eggs, fix or install screens;
- to protect horses and other animals by flushing out water troughs at least once a week;
- to keep horses in indoor stalls at night to reduce their risk of exposure to mosquitoes.

The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported on 23 Aug 2018 that the Montana Department of Livestock has confirmed additional cases of West Nile virus (WNV) in horses in that state. They've confirmed WNV in Montana horses residing in Blaine, Cascade, Lewis and Clark, Powder River, Wheatland, and Yellowstone counties.

The EDCC said cases include:

On 7 Aug 2018, one case was confirmed in Cascade County;
On 14 Aug 2018, one case each was confirmed in Lake and Cascade Counties;
On 15 Aug 2018, one case was confirmed in Cascade County;
On 16 Aug 2018, 2 cases were confirmed in Cascade County, and one was confirmed in Powder River County;
On 17 Aug 2018, one case each was confirmed in Blaine, Wheatland, and Cascade Counties;
On 20 Aug 2018, one case was confirmed in Lewis and Clark County; and
On 21 Aug 2018, 5 cases were confirmed, 3 in Cascade County, one in Lewis and Clark County, and one in Yellowstone County.

Previously, the Department of Livestock confirmed 2 cases of WNV in Montana horses: one in Lake County and one in Musselshell County. The newly reported cases bring the state's total to 18 cases of WNV in Montana horses so far this year [2018].

WNV has no cure; however, some horses can recover with supportive care. Equine mortality rates can reach 30-40 percent.

[What a pity horses die of a disease when there is a very effective vaccine. There are effective sprays specifically designed to control mosquitoes on horses.

Mosquitoes can be in almost any place. There is likely no place safe from this disease because of mosquitoes. Protect yourself from mosquitoes with repellant, wearing long sleeves and avoiding dawn and dusk.

People are also susceptible to WNV from mosquitoes, and some people remain asymptomatic. People who are bitten by an infected mosquito may not even realize they have contracted the disease. However, some people will feel ill with a fever, headaches and body aches within a few days or perhaps weeks after being bitten by an infected mosquito. On rare occasions, it can become a serious disease, and in some cases, it may become a neurological disease.

Provide your animals with the same thoughtful protection -- a vaccine and mosquito repellant -- and eliminate mosquito breeding places.

There is a vaccine for horses to help prevent them from contracting WNV, along with other equine diseases stemming from mosquito bites, but there is no such vaccine for people. - Mod.TG
