I am sending this story to you so you can share it with others who might be
as naive as we were where rabies is concerned.
A couple of years ago in Texas, my husband was out building a deck around
6:00 p.m in the evening, A gray fox trotted up from the creek bed towards
our neighbors, and sat within about 15 feet of him and starting watching
him work. Our neighbors have frequently taken in orphaned animals, so
Jerry assumed that this was one of theirs, so he called me out to see it.
He grabbed some feed, and offered it to the fox with outstretched hand. The
fox calmly got up, and moved towards his hand, and passed it, just as
calmly, and jumped for Jerry's face/neck. Stunned, he kicked it probably 6
feet across the yard. The fox never made a sound. It continued a
horrifying silent attack. He would grab it by the neck, and pull it off,
and it would continue the attack. At one point he slipped, and it got a
good hold on his stomach, until he could get back on his feet and tear it
off again. All this time, it never made a sound!
I was finally able to get a lead pipe to him (the fox seemed unaware that I
was there), and he killed the fox. We put it in a bag for testing, and it
was just as rabid as it could be. In hindsight, we would (should) NEVER
trust a wild animal if it is not behaving according to its species! It
just isn't worth the agony, and the emotional horror. Getting Jerry help,
and finding a doctor who was knowledgeable in treating rabies bites was not
as easy as you would think. It just isn't worth the risk. We annoyed our
neighbors about 3 months later when they left town, and wanted us to feed
their dogs. "Not until their rabies shots are up to date," was our answer.
It still is.
I hope this helps someone to understand about animals in the wild, the need
to notice unusual behavior, and the need to be prepared.
