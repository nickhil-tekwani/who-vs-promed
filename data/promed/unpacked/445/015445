Salmonella cases linked to a Vernon Hills restaurant continue to mushroom,
and Lake County Health Department officials say it is the largest
single-source local outbreak of the disease in recent memory. [The village
of Vernon Hills is located in Lake County, Illinois, just north of Chicago
between Mundelein and Deerfield along Highway 60 on the banks of the Des
Plaines River. - Mod.LL]
On Mon, 7 Jul 2003 the Health Department announced 43 confirmed cases of
salmonella and well over 118 suspected cases, all apparently linked to
the Chili's Grill & Bar located at 567 E. Town Line Road in Vernon Hills.
Of the confirmed cases, 19 are employees of the restaurant and 24 are
members of the public, at least 14 of whom were patrons who dined there
between 23 Jun and 1 Jul 2003. A few of the infected employees also work at
other restaurants in Lake County, but health department spokesperson Leslie
Piotrowski said the names of those eateries are not currently being released.
"We are asking people who ate at any Lake County restaurant and developed
symptoms such as diarrhea, (stomach) cramps, and fever to call us,"
Piotrowski said.
Those who have eaten out recently and developed such symptoms are asked to
call the department's Communicable Disease Program at (847) 377-8130. "We
want to understand the full scope of this outbreak," Piotrowski said.
Meanwhile, the Health Department is continuing an investigation into the
exact cause of the outbreak, and may have preliminary epidemiological test
results as early as today. Tests on some food samples from the restaurant
are also being conducted and should be completed within the next few days.
Piotrowski said officials are looking at 2 theories, one involving tainted
food and another surrounding the possibility that one person may have
inadvertently contaminated the food, possibly due to poor hand-washing
practices.
Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease that usually causes acute inflammation
of the colon and small intestine. Symptoms can include the sudden onset of
headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and sometimes vomiting. The
bacteria are usually passed to others [by contaminating food - Mod.LL] as a
result of improper hand washing by an infected person after using the
washroom, officials said. Most people develop symptoms 12 to 36 hours
after being exposed to the bacterium.
The Chili's restaurant closed voluntarily 1 Jul 2003 as a result of the
outbreak. The restaurant will reopen when it is determined that the workers
affected are free of the disease.
Piotrowski said about 60 people called the Health Department over the
weekend reporting potential symptoms of salmonella infection.
Salmonella infection usually resolves on its own, but in some cases,
antibiotics may be appropriate. Over-the-counter medications for diarrhea
can make the illness worse and should be avoided by those who are infected.

[Inadequate information is given in this posting to assist in understanding
the source of the enteric pathogen. To best understand this, a food
interview was likely administered to individuals who ate in the facility,
whether they became ill or not, to assess which food or foods may be suspected.
(<http://www.cdc.gov/foodborneoutbreaks/standard_questionnaire.htmis>)
Epidemic curves, from eating in the restaurant until becoming ill and cases
over time, can also be useful. The food preparers at a restaurant
represent a group that can readily contaminate food if appropriate hygienic
conditions are not maintained, but the preparers may just as well be
victims if they ingested the food vehicle as well. Although not the rule,
clusters of enteric infection have been described in which the food
vehicle (for instance, a salad bar) had been deliberately contaminated.
Except for the typhoid bacillus, all salmonellae are associated with
contact with animals or animal products such as poorly cooked chicken and
beef, uncooked eggs, and unpasteurized dairy products. Some strains are
characteristic of certain animals, such as turtles, snakes, and other
reptiles such as iguanas. The disease is usually self-limited even if
associated with fever and prominent diarrhea but can cause more significant
illnesses in immunoincompetent hosts such as patients undergoing
chemotherapy, those having received an organ transplant, or those infected
with HIV. - Mod.LL]
