[The following comment has been received from Dr. Michael Tormey in
response to the Moderator's statement in the preceding post that:
"Norovirus outbreaks are more common now in situations where
unrelated individuals congregate together at high density; e.g. in
schools, in hospitals, on board cruise ships, etc.]
Comment
-----------
I think it is of interest to the readers that hospitals (acute care)
are not likely to be an acute norovirus outbreak location in the U.S.
On the other hand, skilled nursing facilities and assisted living
facilities have been. The reason given in the posting -- "where
unrelated individuals congregate" -- certainly fits the step down
units, where private or semi-private rooms with little to no
"congregation" make an acute care hospital in the U.S. a less likely
transmission environment. Indeed, the few outbreaks of norovirus
infection in acute hospitals that I can recall have usually been
potlucks among the staff during the holiday season.
