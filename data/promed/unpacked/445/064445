Syphilis, a systemic sexually transmitted disease with chronic evolution, has seen a resurgence internationally, also in Cuba, a country where the number of reported cases doubled in the last years.

Islay Rodriguez, an investigator from the Pedro Kouri Tropical Medicine Institute (IPK) in Havana, explained to Prensa Latina that neurosyphilis, one of the late stages of the disease, has also increased in Cuba. However, currently it is observed that in seropositive AIDS patients, neurological manifestations can develop in early stages of the disease. For this reason, the IPK National Laboratory is dedicating part of its work to the effective diagnosis of syphilis, said the expert.

The disease [syphilis] is associated with people with AIDS, men that have sex with men, and young people in general. If it is not treated in time, it progresses, going through 3 stages: primary, secondary, and latent (or advanced); the latter may last years, with complications that might even result in death. [Syphilis is considered to have 4 stages: primary, secondary, latent, and late (or tertiary) syphilis.]

Currently we have the best diagnostic tests, which has made us wonder if there really is an increase in incidence, or better detection of the disease, said the Cuban expert.

During the III International Congress: "Spirochetes Havana 2014" Rodriguez noted that in any case, the best thing to do is to prevent the disease. The correct use of condoms helps, but does not really eliminate the risk of infection, since lesions can be present in other unprotected areas, such as the mouth, anus, feet, buttocks, or palms of hands.

[The news report says that there has been an increasing incidence of syphilis, in particular neurosyphilis, in Cuba in the past several years. However, they say that this may possibly be due to a recent increased ability to detect cases that had gone undetected/unreported in the past and as a result, there may not be a true increase in the occurrence of syphilis. Enhanced case detection in recent years could also explain the increased incidence of neurosyphilis, a complication of syphilis that had progressed unchecked because an earlier stage of syphilis went undetected and untreated. - Mod.ML
