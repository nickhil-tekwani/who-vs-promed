The veterinary department in Eastern Province of Zambia, has confirmed the
outbreak of cattle disease commonly known as East Coast fever [produced by
_Theileria parva_, a tick borne parasite. The disease has so far killed 36
animals in some parts of Petauke district.
Petauke district veterinary officer Jimmy Lubinga confirmed the outbreak of
the disease in the district on the weekend. Dr Lubinga said 36 animals had
since died from East Coast Fever (ECF) which was similar to Corridor
Disease (CD).
He attributed the outbreak to lack of dipping chemicals to control ticks.
The veterinary department has since embarked on a campaign to educate the
farmers on how best to control the situation.
"Laboratory tests have confirmed the disease is ECF which has since killed
36 animals. We are working hard to control the situation," Dr Lubinga said.
His office had sent officers to Sinda, Nyanje and other parts of Petauke to
check on the extent of the outbreak.
He said he had advised farmers to report any signs of the diseases to
veterinary authorities in the area to control the situation. Information
Deputy Minister Fidelis Mando said the government would do its best to
address the situation to avoid loss of animals. Mr. Mando appealed to
farmers to work hand in hand with veterinary officers to curb the spread of
the disease in the area.
