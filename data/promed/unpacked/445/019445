State health officials are encouraging Hoosiers [residents of the state of Indiana] to take steps to protect themselves at county and 4H fairs around the state this summer [2013] following detection of 4 cases of variant influenza A(H3N2)v. All individuals visited the Grant County Agricultural Fair, 16-22 Jun 2013, prior to illness, and at least 2 had contact with swine. Variant influenza A(H3N2)v was identified in Indiana last year, with a total of 138 cases in 2012.

The Indiana State Department of Health and the Grant County Health Department continue to investigate these cases. Human infections with (H3N2)v are rare but have most commonly occurred after close proximity to live infected pigs, such as working with them in barns and livestock exhibits at fairs. Influenza viruses are not transmitted by eating pork and pork products. According to the State Board of Animal Health, 13 pigs at the fair tested positive for H3N2. It is not uncommon for pigs to be infected with swine influenza viruses but not show any signs of illness. If ill with influenza they typically recover.

"Fairs are a great way to get outdoors, have some fun and learn about agriculture," said State Health Commissioner William VanNess, MD "If you plan to attend a fair this summer, just be sure to wash your hands frequently and avoid taking food into areas where animals are kept." Symptoms of variant influenza A include: fever, cough, sore throat, chills, headache and muscle aches. Diarrhea and nausea may occur in children. Symptoms can begin approximately one to four days after being exposed to the illness and last from two to seven days.

As several county fairs will open in the next few weeks, State health officials are increasing surveillance for influenza-like illness. "We are increasing our surveillance so we can learn more about this virus and because antiviral treatment is most effective if given within 48 hours," said Dr VanNess. "It's important to contact your health care provider if you begin experiencing flu-like symptoms." And if you have visited a fair or been around animals, let your health care provider know. Influenza antiviral drugs can treat infection with (H3N2)v and quick treatment is especially important for people who are at high risk of serious flu complications, including the very young, the elderly, people with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes, and heart disease and pregnant women.

Visiting animal exhibits is fun and educational, and Hoosiers are reminded to follow some simple safety steps to prevent illness. Wash hands with soap and water before and after petting or touching any animal. Never eat, drink or put anything in your mouth when visiting animal areas, and avoid face-to-face contact with animals. People at high risk for flu complications should avoid close contact with swine in the fair setting particularly.

While influenza is not an uncommon diagnosis in pigs, the State Board of Animal Health encourages swine owners to contact a veterinarian if their animals show signs consistent with flu, including coughing, respiratory illness, off-feed, and fever. Most county fairs have a private veterinary practitioner on call for on-site assistance.

Since there is no vaccine available for people to protect against this (H3N2)v virus, the best way to prevent infection with variant influenza is to avoid sources of exposure to the virus. As always good hygiene and other everyday preventive actions are important to take as well. Wash your hands frequently. Cough or sneeze into your sleeve or elbow. Avoid contact with people or animals that are ill. Stay home if you develop influenza symptoms and contact your health care provider.

In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 309 infections with (H3N2)v in the United States. According to the CDC, most of these infections resulted in mild illness, though 16 people were hospitalized and one person died. Most of the people who were hospitalized and the person who died had one or more high risk conditions.

[A novel reassortant H3N2 influenza virus [(H3N2)v] was identified in the United States last year (2012). The (H3N2)v infections involved a swine-origin H3N2 virus that included the M (matrix) gene from the pandemic 2009 H1N1 (pH1N1) virus. According to Kitikoon and 10 others: 'Pathogenicity and transmission in pigs of the novel A(H3N2)v influenza virus isolated from humans and characterization of swine H3N2 viruses isolated in 2010-2011', J Virol. 2012 Jun; 86(12): 6804-14. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00197-12, JVI.00197-12; http://jvi.asm.org/content/early/2012/03/29/JVI.00197-12, swine influenza virus (SIV) H3N2 with triple reassorted internal genes (TRIG) has been enzootic in US since 1998. Transmission of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus to pigs in the US was followed by reassortment with endemic SIV, resulting in reassorted viruses that include novel H3N2 genotypes (rH3N2p).

Between July-December 2011, 12 cases of human infections with swine-lineage H3N2 viruses containing the pandemic matrix (pM) gene (A(H3N2)v) were detected (see ProMED-mail archived reports listed below). Whole genome analysis of H3N2 viruses isolated from pigs from 2009-2011 showed 6 different rH3N2p genotypes present in the US swine population since 2009. The presence of the pM gene was a common feature among all rH3N2p genotypes, but no specific genotype appeared to predominate in the swine population. Study of the pathogenic, transmission, genetic, and antigenic properties of a human A(H3N2)v isolate and 3 swine H3N2 isolates, H3N2-TRIG and rH3N2p revealed no increased virulence in A(H3N2)v or rH3N2p viruses compared to endemic H3N2-TRIG virus. These authors concluded enhanced transmissibility and/or virulence is unlikely to be a property of these H3N2 recombinant viruses.

The recommendation for Hoosiers to protect themselves by vaccination during the inter-epidemic season seems rather unnecessary and alarmist. Proper attention to personal hygiene and avoidance of unnecessary contact with swine would seem to be adequate. - Mod.CP
