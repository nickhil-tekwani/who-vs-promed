About 336 cattle egrets were found dead near Morocco's Lake Dait
Roumi in Khemisset province, east of Rabat, the High Commissioner for
Waters, Forests and the Fight against Desertification, announced here
Friday [3 Feb 2006], suspecting "poisoning". [Map at

"We are in a scenario that shows mass poisoning. It's the period when
we use weed killers and phytosanitary products," the official MAP
news agency, quoted High Commissioner Abdeladim Lhafi as saying.
Out of these cattle egrets, 173 were found in a public dump 5 km from
the lake, he added.
The Moroccan official, who does not mention any possibility of
infection to bird flu, revealed that some samples were taken from a
few dead birds that are being analysed. The results will be known in
the next few days, he added.
Quoting a reliable source, Moroccan Daily Al Bayane reported that
some 120 wild birds perished on 21 Jan 2006 at Lake Dait Roumi.
"The causes of the deaths remain unknown. Some sources blame
poisoning due to insecticides, others suggest cold weather while a
3rd group think possible infection to bird flu," the paper said.
According to a source close to the Moroccan ministry of Agriculture,
several hundreds of birds are living in the same area and show "no
anomaly", dismissing in this case any possibility of bird flu, a
disease that affects all types of birds.
Meanwhile, the situation of bird flu in Morocco is so far calm,
according to local authorities, who noted that adequate control of
fowls and migratory birds" gives no cause for concern".
