A new MERS case recorded in Jordan
----------------------------------
A new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) case has been recorded for a Jordanian male (38), who has recently entered the Kingdom from abroad, the Ministry of Health reported on Wednesday [26 Aug 2015].

The latest case is the 2nd in less than 24 hours.

Since 2012, 14 MERS cases have been recorded in Jordan, according to official data. [See comment following [2] below. - Mod.MPP]

Primary Health Care Department Director in the ministry, Dr. Bashir Qasir, said the patient is receiving treatment in a private hospital and his condition is critical.

Yesterday [25 Aug 2015], the Ministry of Health announced that a man in his 60s, who has recently come from Saudi Arabia, was diagnosed to have the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and he is now in critical condition. [See section [2] below. - Mod.MPP]

[As mentioned below, there were an additional 7 cases retrospectively diagnosed from the 1st known outbreak of MERS-CoV that occurred in a hospital ICU in Jordan in April 2012. With the report of 2 newly confirmed cases, both in critical condition, confirmed within approximately 24 hours of each other, both "imported" cases, one from Saudi Arabia, the other "from abroad," is disconcerting. ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate receiving more information on this case, especially on the definition of "abroad," whether it refers to someone on the Arabian peninsula, or elsewhere, and if so, where?

Jordan records coronavirus case of national coming from Saudi Arabia
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A new Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) case has been recorded for a man who has recently come from Saudi Arabia, the country where most cases of this disease are reported.

The man, who is in his 60s, was admitted to a private hospital suffering from breathing difficulty, coughing and fever, the ministry of health said. He was diagnosed to have the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and he is now in critical condition, the ministry added.

Since 2012, 13 MERS cases have been recorded in Jordan, according to official data.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Mary Marshall

[Prior to the report of this case, according to the statistics maintained by the European CDC, Jordan had reported a total of 19 cases including 6 deaths (http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/press/news/_layouts/forms/News_DispForm.aspx?ID=1270&List=8db7286c-fe2d-476c-9133-18ff4cb1b568&Source=http%3A%2F%2Fecdc%2Eeuropa%2Eeu%2Fen%2FPages%2Fhome%2Easpx), including the 1st known nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV in an ICU in April 2012. As 7 of the 9 reported cases in the original outbreak were diagnosed through retrospective serology, they have not been included in official statistics reported by Jordan and the WHO. The last reported case was an imported case from Saudi Arabia confirmed in late December 2014 (see MERS-CoV (03): Saudi Arabia, new cases, new fatality, Jordan, WHO 20150107.3077259 and MERS-CoV (68): Jordan, Saudi Arabia, RFI 20141229.3057913).

More information on the epidemiologic investigation surrounding this case would be greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]

[The outbreak in Riyadh continues. Of the 9 newly confirmed cases, 8 were reported from Riyadh, and 1 was reported from Hufoof. As a reminder, there was an outbreak (nosocomial) of MERS-CoV reported from Hufoof during the period April through July 2015, with the most recent reported case on 16 Jul 2015. A question that comes to mind is whether this newly reported case from Hufoof (on 26 Aug 2015) is a sporadic case or whether there may have been silent transmission ongoing in the Hufoof area related to the earlier outbreak mentioned. Noteworthy is that 2 of the newly reported cases are healthcare workers.

Repeating and updating my previous moderator comment on the situation in Saudi Arabia.... There are now a total of 1171 cases of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection, including 502 deaths, reported in Saudi Arabia since June 2012. With respect to the ongoing transmission of MERS-CoV in Riyadh, since the beginning of August 2015 there have been a total of 109 newly confirmed cases and 34 fatalities reported. Information is not available to determine how many of these 109 newly confirmed cases in Riyadh are associated with the outbreak in the National Guard hospital vs. elsewhere in Riyadh, given the periodic reports of individuals with no history of contact with other known cases, or those whose possible contact history is currently under review. With the continued high volume of newly confirmed cases reported on a daily basis, it is becoming increasingly more difficult to link outcome reports (fatalities and recoveries) to the initial confirmation reports as the amount of information on each case is sparse, leaving location of report, age, gender and whether they are a healthcare worker as the variables to match -- with multiple reports matching on these 4 variables.

The HealthMap/ProMED map of Saudi Arabia can be found at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=3605963,131, and the locations of newly reported cases, deaths and recoveries can be found at maps available at the source URLs. - Mod.MPP]

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[The global case count reported through WHO is now at 1474 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including at least 515 deaths, for a reported case fatality rate of 34.9 percent -- approximately 10 percentage points lower than the reported case fatality rate in Saudi Arabia. Once again the WHO update provides additional information on the newly reported cases including dates of onset, where known dates of contact and where known implicated contact case. Noteworthy is that while there doesn't appear to be a known superspreader, identified in the above list of 13 new cases, if you look at the 2 WHO reports (see section [5] below), case no. 12 from the WHO update of 21 Aug 2015 has appeared 3 times as the contact case identified as the high risk exposure for MERS-CoV infection. Of the 13 cases, 3 are in healthcare workers. - Mod.MPP]

[The WHO updates continue to fill in the blanks on epidemiologic information on these cases. With the high volume of cases reported on a daily basis it is a challenge to keep up with a correct line listing of cases and links. One of the questions that arises when reading these reports deals with high risk exposures. Some of the patients are clearly demarcated as having been admitted to the hospital for co-morbidities and after a number of days in the hospital, develop symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV infection. In other cases, there is mention that the individual developed symptoms on day X, went to hospital A where there are MERS-CoV cases, and worsens after a few days and then is tested for MERS-CoV infection and found to be positive -- cases 2 and 4 in the above report are good examples. So the question remains, was the case admitted for symptoms consistent with MERS-CoV associated disease, or was the case admitted for other reasons and exposure to the MERS-CoV occurred either during the admission process or shortly after admission?

It's impressive that there were 29 newly confirmed cases reported in the 4-day period mentioned above, and when reading the individual background information, the pattern clearly arises that individuals are admitted to the hospital for one reason and while there develop the complicating infection with MERS-CoV. - Mod.MPP]
