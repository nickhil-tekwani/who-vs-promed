Three people have died, and 13 have been admitted to hospital with
symptoms of bird flu in Indonesia, a nurse treating the patients said
Wednesday [6 Aug 2008]. Officials and residents in Asahan district of
North Sumatra province said villagers began showing symptoms of avian
flu after a large number of chickens died suddenly last week. The
nurse at Asahan district's Kisaran hospital said 3 people had died
after suffering bird flu-like symptoms in Air Batu village.
"According to residents there, a number of chickens died suddenly
last week followed by several pigeons. Days later, 3 people died with
the same ailments," the nurse, told AFP.

Another 13 people had been admitted to the hospital with "high
temperatures and respiratory problems," she said. Two of these -- a
baby boy and a 7-year-old girl -- were transferred early Wednesday [6
Aug 2008] to a bird flu isolation unit at Adam Malik hospital in the
provincial capital of Medan, officials said. Adam Malik hospital
spokesman Sinar Ginting confirmed that blood samples from the 2
children were sent Wednesday [6 Aug 2008] to a health ministry
laboratory in Jakarta for analysis. "We are now waiting for the
result," he said.

The father of the baby boy said a lot of poultry had died in the
village a week ago. His baby developed a high fever and respiratory
problems shortly afterward. A spokeswoman for the health ministry
could not be reached for comment. The ministry, which has stopped
giving regular bird flu updates, announced earlier this week that the
human toll from avian influenza in Indonesia had risen to 112 with
the recent death of a 19-year-old man [The WHO Table of the
Cumulative number of Confirmed human Cases of Avian Influenza
A/(H5N1), which has not been updated since 19 Jun 2008, records the
number of deaths in Indonesia as 110. - Mod.CP]. The man was from a
town adjoining the capital Jakarta on Java island.

Eleven people from Air Batu village, Air Batu subdistrict, Asahan
regency in North Sumatra, were taken to Asahan's Abdul Manan hospital
early Wednesday [6 Aug 2008] after showing symptoms of avian
influenza, more commonly known as bird flu.

Two patients were later admitted to Medan's Adam Malik Hospital for
further treatment, while the other 11 were still undergoing treatment
at Abdul Manan hospital. "Two patients from Abdul Manan hospital, a
7-year-old girl and an 8-month-old baby boy, arrived here at 2 a.m.,"
Adam Malik Hospital spokesman Sinar Ginting told Kompas.com on
Wednesday [6 Aug 2008]. Ginting said the 2 patients were in a
"critical" condition, with a high fever, serious respiratory problems
and a cough. The 2 patients, he said, had no history of direct
contact with chickens, but a week earlier, chickens around their
neighborhood had died suddenly. "Officials from the local health
agency have examined the chickens and found they were positively
infected with H5N1 virus," Ginting said.

Ginting said a team of doctors led by Dr Luhur Soeroso had provided
all appropriate treatment to the patients, who are being held for
further tests even though they are only suspected of having the disease.

[Taken together, these 2 reports indicate that 3 people have died and
at least another 13 people (including 2 severely ill children) have
been admitted to hospital with suspected avian influenza virus
infection. The description of the signs and symptoms are not
sufficiently specific to confirm a diagnosis of avian influenza. The
evidence is circumstantial (contemporaneous outbreaks of poultry
deaths) rather than specific. Further information and the results of
laboratory tests are awaited.
