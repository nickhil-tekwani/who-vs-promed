A total of 2 people are in hospital after an outbreak of a potentially fatal _E. coli_ O157 infection linked to a cheese manufacturer in Lanarkshire. 2 batches of Dunsyre Blue Cheese are being recalled, but the manufacturer said it was just a precaution.

As many as 14 people across Scotland have contracted _E. coli_, with 2 cases in England. Of those, 2 are being treated in hospital while the rest are recovering at home.

About 180 kg [approx. 400 lbs] of the Dunsyre Blue Cheese are being recalled according to Food Standards Scotland. The agency said cheese with the batch codes C22 or D14 on its packaging should not be eaten, and should instead be either returned to the retailer or disposed of.

Errington Cheese, based at Carnwath, insisted the outbreak had not yet been linked back to their product and that the recall was a precaution. The company said investigations were being carried out by itself and by the food regulator. The voluntary recall was issued after investigations led by Health Protection Scotland into cases of _E. coli_ O157 pointed to a link with particular batches of Dunsyre Blue, a cheese made with unpasteurized milk.

Food Standards Scotland advises that vulnerable groups, including pregnant women, children and elderly people should not consume unpasteurized milk and dairy products made from unpasteurised milk due to the increased risk of food poisoning. The agency said it was working closely with South Lanarkshire Council and Errington Cheese to further investigate the matter.

_Brucella abortus_,
_Brucella melitensis_,
_Mycobacterium bovis_,
_Salmonella_ species,
_Listeria monocytogenes_,
_Campylobacter_ species,
_Yersinia_ species, and
_Coxiella burnetii_.

Pathogenic microbes also include non-zoonotic organisms such as:
_Streptococcus pyogenes_,
_Salmonella_ Typhi,
_Corynebacterium diphtheriae_,
_Shigella_ species,
_Salmonella_ Paratyphi A,
_Salmonella_ Paratyphi B,
enterotoxins from _Staphylococcus aureus_, and
