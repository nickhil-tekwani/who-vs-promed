CWD [chronic wasting disease] is a fatal neurological disease of deer, elk and moose. The elk was found in elk hunt area 34 -- an area that overlaps with deer hunt areas where CWD was previously documented and is bordered on the north by elk hunt area 35, where CWD had already been documented.

The elk was found by a landowner and reported to Game and Fish personnel on 12 Nov 2015 in Beaver Creek Canyon, which is about 15 miles west of the town of Kaycee.

"This has been another active year for Game and Fish's CWD surveillance program. This is an important part of our public awareness program and of our ability to monitor this disease within the state," Scott Edberg, Deputy Chief of the Wildlife Division, said. Consistent with the Centers for Disease Control [and Prevention], Game and Fish does not recommend people eat deer, elk or moose that test positive for CWD.

Game and Fish personnel continue to watch for deer, elk and moose that appear sick. Game and Fish also continues to collect samples through hunter field checks and at CWD sampling stations. Game and Fish personnel collect and analyze more than 1600 CWD samples annually throughout the state.

Hunters who wish to have their deer, elk or moose tested for CWD outside of the department's CWD surveillance program can to do so by contacting the Wyoming State Veterinary Lab at (307) 766-9925. Hunters submitting samples through Game and Fish should be aware that it may take a few weeks after their animal is sampled to get their test results. Each person submitting a sample receives a sticker with information on how to check their results on our website.

For more information on CWD transmission and regulations on transportation and disposal of carcasses please visit the Game and Fish website at: https://wgfd.wyo.gov/Wildlife-in-Wyoming/More-Wildlife/Wildlife-Disease/Chronic-Wasting-Disease/CWD-Disease-Info.

[2] Deer - Wisconsin

A deer found with chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Three Lakes this fall will trigger a major change in how people interact with the animals in the Northwoods.

To slow the spread of the deadly brain disease, the DNR (Department of Natural Resources) will ban deer baiting and feeding in Oneida, Vilas, and Forest counties next month [January 2016].

"That feeding ban, too, will be a huge change for a lot of people up in this part of the country," DNR Warden Supervisor Dave Walz told Newswatch 12 Tuesday.

The upcoming baiting and feeding ban in Oneida, Forest, and Vilas counties will make it much harder to draw in deer to yards or properties.

"That's some people's enjoyment in the wintertime, when you're kind of holed up in the winter, because of a lot of snow and cold, to see those deer, or some people even like to call them their pets, even have names for them, come toward the backyard and watch them out of the window," Walz said.

Store manager Becky Wilde sells plenty of deer corn at Coontail Market in Boulder Junction. With the new ban, that part of her business will likely start falling off. Wilde says her store doesn't even specialize in feed, but still, it clears about a pallet a week -- or about 40 bags of deer corn of 50s pounds each.

Northern Exchange in St. Germain does specialize in feed, sometimes selling 1 or 2 pallets a day. Its owners said 60 to 70 percent of their revenue comes from deer feed.

The DNR understands the new ban is certain to take a toll on some local businesses.

"Some people are going to welcome this, and other people aren't going to welcome it," Walz said.

Newswatch 12 asked our Facebook friends what they thought. 1 person told us, "If you really love deer, then stop exposing them by baiting and feeding them until the outbreak slows or stops." Another person said, "That's overkill. You should still be able to feed corn to the deer in your yard."

Even though feeding will become illegal, selling that feed won't.

"I feel that if retailers are still allowed to sell deer corn, some residents are still going to continue to purchase bags," Wilde, the Coontail manager, said.

"They're just going to have to understand that they might have to give up a little bit of their enjoyment right now in order to see the bigger picture and protect our deer herd for the future," Walz said.

The DNR told Newswatch 12 the ban will go into effect sometime in January 2016, after the deer hunting seasons are over.

[This has been an active year for the Wyoming surveillance program. Apparently, "seek and you will find" is certainly the case this year in Wyoming, and a few other states as well.

This is a neurological disease of cervids and thus far, has not been shown to affect humans; but caution is advised if your hunted animal is found to have the disease.

To understand more about the hunt areas in Wyoming, please see the hunt area map at https://wgfd.wyo.gov/Regulations/Regulation-PDFs/REGULATIONS_CH6_MAP.

The deer-feeding ban in Wisconsin is interesting. What proof does DNR have that a feeding ban will stop or decrease CWD? Banning a congregation of deer stops airborne infectious diseases from circulating; but CWD is not airborne, but an individual disease. While there may be environmental contamination and no ante-mortem test, testing the deer prior to entering a contaminated environmental area is not possible, and it cannot be proven that the deer have not already been exposed prior to entering a contaminated environment. Therefore banning feeding really does not seem to make much scientific sense, except deprive business of sales and feeders from enjoyment from watching the animals. - Mod.TG
