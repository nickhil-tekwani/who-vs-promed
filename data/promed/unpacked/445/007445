Details on the situation of bois noir phytoplasma in Switzerland
In Switzerland, the presence of [a] phytoplasma causing bois noir on
grapevine (stolbur phytoplasma) has recently been confirmed by PCR in
several cantons. Bois noir was confirmed in Valais (on cvs. Chardonnay,
Pinot Noir), in Vaud (cvs. Gamaret, Diolinoir, Doral), and in Geneve (cv.
Chardonnay). In Ticino, all grapevine-producing areas are affected by bois
noir. Bois noir does not cause serious epidemics, although it can cause
some local problems (especially at the edges of vineyards).
However, its possible confusion with grapevine flavescence doree (EPPO A2
quarantine pest), which has never been found in Switzerland, justifies the
continuation of careful monitoring of Swiss vineyards for the presence of
phytoplasma diseases.

[Phytoplasmas were formerly named mycoplasma-like organisms (MLOs). They
are very small, phloem-limited plant pathogenic bacteria that lack a
defined cell wall. They are the smallest known microorganisms that
replicate autonomously, but they have not been isolated, purified, or
cultured on an axenic medium. They are pleomorphic and can move across
sieve plates in the phloem, spreading throughout affected plants.
Phytoplasmas are vectored by insects, primarily leafhoppers, planthoppers,
and psyllids. They can be detected by using phytoplasma-specific stains on
sections of infected plant tissues, electron microscopy, and molecular
techniques based on DNA probes, PCR, and ELISA. As indicated in a previous
post, phytoplasma diseases are emerging on food crops around the world. -
