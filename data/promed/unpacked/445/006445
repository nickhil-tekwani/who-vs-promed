The European Commission said on Wednesday [7th Oct the spread of BSE in
Portugal was more serious than official figures suggested and called for an
action plan to stop the crisis in its tracks. The toughest measure the plan
could contain would be a complete export ban on Portuguese beef, similar to
one placed on Britain in 1996.
Portugal has been cited as saying that there have been more than 50 new
cases of mad cow disease or BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) this
year, bringing total confirmed cases to around 150.
Apparently an initial inspection carried out by EU veterinary experts in
May fuelled the Commission's fears after it concluded there were serious
failings in Portugal's controls over animal feed. A second inspection at
the end of last month, made at Portugal's request, failed to ease those
concerns. The Commission was quoted on Wednesday following a provisional
examination of this report saying, "The independent recycling of the BSE
agent in the Portuguese cattle population can no longer be excluded."
Portugal last month issued a decree banning the use of suspect animal feed
in the food chain and claimed the situation had improved significantly.
Agriculture Minister Fernando Gomes da Silva came under fire over the
crisis, which intensified after Spain closed its border to Portuguese beef
last month. He recently stepped down from office through ill health and has
been replaced by his deputy, Luis Capoulas Santos.

Portugal on Thursday pledged "draconian" measures to stop the spread of mad
cow disease and calm European Union fears the problem was growing.
Cabinet spokesman Vitalino Canas told a news conference that the Portuguese
Agriculture Ministry would give details of the action to be taken within
the next few days. The government was responding to a European Commission
warning on Wednesday that the extent of the disease was more serious than
official Portuguese figures suggested.
