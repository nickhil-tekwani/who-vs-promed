Statement on the Death of Dr. Jonathan Mann

By Dr. David Brandling-Bennett, Deputy Director, Pan American Health
Organization


Washington, Sept. 3, 1998 -- We are deeply saddened to hear of the loss of
Dr. Jonathan Mann and his wife, Dr. Mary Lou Clements-Mann, in the tragic
Swissair crash. Dr. Mann was a long-time colleague and friend who gained a
worldwide reputation as an upright, caring physician interested in the
persons affected by the tragic AIDS epidemic. He gave his full support to
us at the Pan American Health Organization in the early days of the
discovery of the virus and the vast implications this would have for
mankind.
When we began to disseminate scientific and technical information about the
disease through the Pan American AIDS Teleconferences, Dr. Mann gladly
endorsed and participated in these efforts, and he helped us reach
thousands of health care personnel in more than 35 countries with the
latest, best available data on AIDS and how to prevent it.
Since his days in the New Mexico State Health Department, when his
compassion for his fellow man became evident, through our time together at
the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization's Global
Program on AIDS, Dr. Mann always made it clear that he cared about the
faces behind the statistics. An epidemiologist with field experience in
Zaire, Dr. Mann always focused on health and human rights, including how
health policies affected human rights, and what impacts human rights
violations have on health. This was particularly important in the early
days of the AIDS epidemic, when we had to fight stereotypes and
discrimination, and is still true today.
His intense drive and capacity for work made the Global Aids Program a
worldwide success, and his deep concern and caring for people in all walks
of life honored the founding principles of medicine and international
public health. We will miss him and his wife very much.

Dr. Jonathan Mann, among those killed in the crash of a Swissair passenger
plane in the Atlantic Ocean off Halifax, Nova Scotia, was known as a
pioneer in the global fight against AIDS. Mann, 51, was dean of the School
of Public Health at the Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia. The United Nations said Mann and his wife Mary-Lou
Clements-Mann were on their way to attend a series of World Health
Organization and UNAIDS meetings on AIDS.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases, told United Press International Mann's death was a
"major, major" loss to AIDS research. Fauci recalled that Mann was one of
the first and most persistent loud voices in the 1980s to call attention to
the world that AIDS was a global epidemic that was going to become a
heterosexual disease. "He pointed out to the world and established the
relationship between other sexually transmitted diseases and AIDS
transmission," Fauci said. From 1986 to 1990, Mann was founding director of
the World Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS, based in Geneva.
Fauci said he "lit the fire for WHO (regarding AIDS research) and shoved
and encouraged and berated the rest of the world to pay attention."
In a statement, Dorothy Brown, the president of Allegheny University said
Mann was "an internationally recognized public health expert and human
rights advocate." On Jan. 1, he became the first dean of the university's
newly formed school of public health. Previously, he served as the first
Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Professor of Health and Human Rights and Professor
of Epidemiology and International Health at the Harvard School of Public
Health. Mann founded and directed the Francois-Xavier Bagnoud Center for
Health and Human Rights, the first academic institution devoted to the
"inextricable connection between human rights and health," Brown said. Mann
is survived by three children and his mother.

Colleagues and friends Â–
Word is already circulating, but if you had not already heard I wanted to
let you know that Jonathan Mann and his wife, Mary Lou Clements, were on
the Swissair flight that went down over Nova Scotia last night.
We are all stunned and enormously sorrowed by their loss. Jonathan was a
unique energy in the fight against AIDS and the struggle for human rights
and dignity for all people. His intellect was matched by his enormous
heart and his willingness to take risks for the things he believed in and
the people he loved. I will miss him as a friend and as a constant
inspiration to moral action.
We here at the Council are looking for ways that we could suitably
memorialize Jonathan's life and contributions to health and human rights,
and would appreciate your suggestions.
With deep sadness,
Nils Daulaire
President
National Council for International Health
