USA (MI): Nearly 200 Patrons at Restaurant in Lansing Fall Ill
-----------------------------------------------
Local health officials have identified 195 people who became ill
after eating at an Italian restaurant, and the number of reported
cases was expected to increase. Patrons became ill the last weekend
in January 2006 after eating at Carrabba's Italian Grill on West
Saginaw Highway. "This is a large outbreak, in part because they
served a lot of people that weekend," said Dr. Robert Schirmer,
medical director of the Barry-Eaton District Health Department. He
told the Lansing State Journal for a story published Saturday [4 Feb
2006] that the illnesses resulted from norovirus infection, which can
cause severe vomiting and diarrhea that usually lasts about a day.
The health department cited the restaurant for allowing an ill
employee to work that weekend and for poor hygiene practices,
Schirmer said. There are no fines for the violations, but if they are
not corrected, the restaurant's license can be revoked, said Eric
Pessell, who oversees the health department's food-safety program. An
official with Outback Steakhouse Inc., which owns Carrabba's, said
managers are reviewing and reinforcing food-safety procedures with
employees.

Ireland: Outbreak of Winter Vomiting Bug at St. John's Hospital in Sligo
-----------------------------------------------
An outbreak of the winter vomiting bug [norovirus infection] has been
confirmed at St. John's Hospital in Sligo. The HSE have confirmed
this evening they are dealing with an outbreak of the virus at the
hospital. They say they have put in place precautions to control the
spread of it and that these are working satisfactorily.
However, the HSE have requested the cooperation of the public in
restricting their visiting to essential visiting only, particularly
at the weekend. Visitors are requested to visit one patient only and
not to move around the hospital.

USA (MI): Virus sickens dozens at Hotel in Chicago
-----------------------------------------------
More than 100 guests, workers and attendees of a fundraising event at
the Drake Hotel on Chicago's Near North Side became ill over the
weekend [4-5 Feb 2006], sickened by what health officials say was an
ingested virus.
The outbreak was linked to a "norovirus" that caused nasty stomach
symptoms, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, said Tim Hadac,
spokesman for the Chicago Department of Public Health. Hadac said
none of the afflicted had reported any serious complications, and
though several people went to local hospital emergency rooms seeking
treatment, none had to be admitted.
"We have worked with the hotel to essentially order a top-to-bottom
scrubbing of not only the kitchens, but the entire hotel," Hadac
said. He added that officials continue to investigate, and the source
of the virus has not yet been found.
Drake officials today [7 Feb 2006] issued a statement confirming "a
number of guests and employees" became ill starting Friday [3 Feb
2006]. The hotel is working with the city to find the cause, the
statement said. General Manager Gregor Andreewitch said the hotel
today was operating normally, and all of its kitchens and restaurants
were open. He said he was not aware of anyone needing
hospitalization, but added, "We have asked whoever has become ill to
see a medical doctor."
Neither Andreewitch nor Drake spokesman Robert Allegrini could recall
any similar outbreaks in the hotel's past. "We're a hotel that's
known for its sterling reputation," Allegrini said. "As such, this is
an anomaly."
Sue Wilson, co-founder of the Children's Medical Research Foundation,
said her organization was holding an annual fundraiser, the
Sweetheart Dinner-Dance, at the hotel on Friday [3 Feb 2006] night.
The evening included a full menu of hors d'oeuvre and entrees, she
said. On Saturday afternoon, disturbing calls began to trickle in. By
Sunday, it was a flood.
"My 1st assumption of course was, 'Oh my goodness, great, we have the
flu,'" said Wilson, whose foundation gathers funding and support for
research into Sanfilipo Syndrome and other children's diseases. "But
when I started getting calls from guests, my concern level went up,
and I called the Drake." Several people reported going to the
hospital for dehydration, Wilson said. "It's a vicious one, whatever
it is," she said. "I'm very concerned about our guests."
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
noroviruses usually cause symptoms 12 to 48 hours after exposure.
Most people recover within a few days, and dehydration often is the
worst side effect. The virus must be ingested and most often is
transmitted through contaminated food or drink, according to the CDC.
Its spread can be prevented through careful sanitation, cleaning and
hand-washing. Hotels, cruise ships and other settings with
large-scale accommodations are the most common locations for
outbreaks, according to the CDC. In 2004, more than 1000 guests and
workers at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas fell ill to the virus. And
more than 1100 may have been infected in September 2005 in the
aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, according to the Journal of the
American Medical Association.
