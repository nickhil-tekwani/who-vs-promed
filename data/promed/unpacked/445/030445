Tainted peanut butter that caused salmonella in 41 of the 50 USA states
also was sold in more than 60 other countries on 3 other continents and
islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific, the manufacturer says.
It was sold in Iraq, Iceland, India, American Virgin Islands, British
Virgin Islands, Netherlands Antilles, South Korea, Singapore, Brazil,
Belize, Africa, Europe, and South America.
Stephanie Childs, a spokeswoman for the manufacturer, ConAgra Foods Inc,
said on Mon 26 Feb 2007, that word of the problem with the tainted peanut
butter has gone out everywhere peanut butter is sold under the Peter Pan
and Great Value label: If the top on the jar has a number starting with
"2111," do not eat it. "This is a full recall, including all the product,"
Childs said.
During the weekend, China announced a recall of the peanut butter. The
official Xinhua news agency said 3 batches (totaling 742 cases) of the 2
brands were imported between Sep 2006 and Jan 2007. The agency said at
least 156 cases already had been sold in Beijing, and even though the lids
had the suspect code, no one had reported being sickened by the peanut butter.

The media and ProMED-mail don't seem to have picked up the news yet that
the US has informed INFOSAN, the WHO Food Safety program that the
implicated lot 2111 has been distributed in at least 70 countries.
I can personally confirm that I purchased a jar from this lot here in Lima,
Peru on 26 Jan 2007. We are in the process of culturing it.
Today, 23 Feb 2007, I went back to the chain supermarket of the original
purchase and no Peter Pan was anywhere on the shelf. Thus it appears as if
the manufacturer may have notified its distributors of the problem in all
these countries and the product has been quietly withdrawn. However, there
has been no widespread notification of consumers in these countries by the
manufacturer and the distibutors. Consumers may have potentially
contaminated product in their homes, so perhaps ProMED-mail should help
spread the word and also alert readers to be on the lookout for related
salmonella cases.
