AMRITSAR, INDIA. September 15, 1998. A deadly disease, which has
afflicted the paddy rice, including the basmati, in certain blocks
of the border districts of Amritsar and Gurdaspur, has created
panic among the farmers and concern among experts. The
agricultural experts are still probing in the dark about this
mysterious epidemic first noticed in Gurdaspur district two years
back even as the farmers now refer to it as ''jaundice."

The afflicted paddy plant first turns pale yellow and gradually
starts decaying. It also results in the stunted growth of the paddy
plant due, thus grains do not form. The varieties sown late are
more prone to its attack. State Agriculture Director A. S.
Randhawa, who toured the afflicted areas here yesterday, said that
30 000 hectares of paddy in Gurdaspur district and 1200 hectares
in Amritsar district had been affected by this mysterious disease.

The existing insecticides, herbicides or pesticides have failed to
control the spread of the disease, which was limited to only a
couple of hectares in 1996 and last year, he added.
