Ministry: plague in Tibet brought under control
-----------------------------------------------
The plague in Zhongba, a county in Xigaze Prefecture of south west China's
Tibet Autonomous Region, has been brought under control, the Chinese
Ministry of Health cited a report of the Tibet Department of Health as
saying. The epidemic has so far affected 5 people, an official with the
ministry said here on Sat 25 Jun 2005. The disease came over them during
the period 13 to 18 Jun 2005, and 2 of them died.

The official stated that, after the epidemic occurred, health organizations
in the Tibet autonomous region immediately launched an epidemiology probe
in an effort to track down and quarantine the people who had had direct
contact with the patients, to oblige them to take preventive medicines, as
well as taking other disease prevention and control measures, including
sterilization and quarantine.

After receiving report of the epidemic, the ministry also immediately sent
experts to the epidemic area to help cope with it. The ministry reported
the epidemic to the WHO early Saturday morning, 25 Jun 2005. Meanwhile, the
ministry asked the epidemic areas to beef up publicity about prevention and
to urge local people to report suspect cases to health departments as soon
as possible.

2 die of plague after eating marmot in China's Tibet region
-----------------------------------------------------------
2 people died of plague, and 3 others were hospitalized, after they ate
marmot meat in a remote area of China's Tibet region, state media said on
Sun 26 Jun 2005.

The 5 migrant road workers became ill after eating marmot on 11 Jun 2005 in
Tibet's Zhongba county, close to China's border with Nepal, the official
Xinhua news agency said. Doctors treated the 5 workers for an unspecified
form of plague, but 2 of them died in the hospital, the agency said.

Health officials quarantined 75 people who had contact with the infected
workers, but none showed plague-like symptoms. Police were also trying to
trace a woman who had contact with the infected people but crossed the
border into Nepal on 21 Jun 2005.

The health ministry reported the infections to the WHO and the Nepalese
government on Sat 25 Jun 2005, the agency said. The most common form is the
bubonic plague, which became known as the "black death" after a major
outbreak spread to Europe from Central Asia in the 14th century. Some
experts believe the Black Death 1st spread to humans through contact with
marmots, which are still commonly hunted for food by Mongolians.

Smaller outbreaks of bubonic plague are frequently reported in remote areas
of north western China and Mongolia. In 2004, plague outbreaks linked to
marmot hunting killed 8 and infected at least 11 others in a remote area of
Qinghai province, which occupies the northern half of the Tibetan plateau.

[ProMED-mail thanks Dan Silver for contributing the 1st posting. We would
appreciate more information regarding the manifestations of plague in these
individuals. The form of _Yersinia pestis_ infection is not stated here,
but the institution of quarantine in contacts suggests that a plague
pneumonia may have been present as a primary or secondary manifestation. -
