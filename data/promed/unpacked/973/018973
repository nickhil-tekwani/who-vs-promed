500 People a day are vaccinated against yellow fever
----------------------------------------------------
Dr. Jose Mercedes Aldave Pita, director of health of this department,
informed El Comercio that up through the end of May 1999, since the
beginning of the year 7 cases of yellow fever, 3 of them fatal, had been
registered.
[The previous case count from Junin Department was 5, as of 18 May 1999,
see summary ref. above - Mod.JW
Close to the police post of El Pedregal, in the district of San Ramon,
province of Chanchamayo, Junin, which is the port of entry to the central
jungle, there is a health team that has been vaccinating approximately 500
people a day against yellow fever. Beginning in 1997 obligatory vaccination
of all citizens who enter this zone was started by specialized personnel
who deliver the service 24 hours a day at the [police posts of El Pedregal
and in San Luis de Shuaro.
More than 60 000 vaccinated
-------------------------------------
Health personnel reported that up through April 1999 -- the period during
which they harvest coffee in the central jungle region -- a large number of
people arrived and they registered an average of 500 vaccinations per day.
In total, approximately 60,000 persons [were vaccinated. Added to this,
4,500 citizens were immunized against yellow fever in the past month of May
1999.
Vaccination is obligatory for all persons who do not have a certificate of
vaccination from another centre in the country. The police of the control
posts in El Pedregal and San Luis de Shuaro are in charge of persuading
[sic those who refuse or resist receiving the vaccine.
