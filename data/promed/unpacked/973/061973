MEASLES - GERMANY (03): WORLD CUP ALERT

The Pan American Health Organization is warning travelers to the World Cup
in Germany to make certain they are immunized against measles, in light of
recent measles outbreaks reported in Germany and other European countries.
"There is a real possibility that residents of the Americas traveling to
Germany will be exposed to measles virus. PAHO recommends that every
country in the Region adopt measures to prevent importation of measles
virus to the Americas from overseas," said Dr. Jon K. Andrus, lead senior
advisor of PAHO's immunization program.
"We are telling country health officials that any resident of the Americas
traveling outside the Western Hemisphere should be immune to measles before
departure, and health care workers in the public and private sectors should
be alerted to the possibility of measles importations," he said.
Since January 2006, the German region of North Rhine-Westphalia has
reported 1106 cases of measles, the largest measles outbreak recorded in
Germany since mandatory notification was introduced in 2001. Three cities
in that region, Cologne, Dortmund, and Gelsenkirchen, are hosting soccer
games in the 2006 World Cup, and 6 of the 8 teams from the Americas are
scheduled to play in those cities. Measles outbreaks have also been
reported in Denmark, Greece, Spain, Sweden and Ukraine.
In the Americas, since the goal of measles elimination was adopted in
September 1994, measles incidence has decreased by more than 99 percent. A
recent outbreak in Venezuela, the first in 4 years, which resulted in 49
confirmed cases, began with a case imported from Spain. Mexico has reported
22 confirmed cases, Canada 7, and the United States 13. All other countries
have no confirmed cases of measles. Transmission of the D6 measles virus
genotype -- which began in 1995 and caused large outbreaks in Argentina,
Bolivia, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti -- was interrupted in
September 2001. The subsequent transmission of the D9 measles virus
genotype in Venezuela was interrupted in November 2002, 14 months after it
had started. The previous Venezuelan outbreak was considered the last
instance of widespread endemic transmission of the measles virus in the
Americas.
"As long as measles eradication is not pursued globally, imported or
import-related measles cases will continue to occur in the Americas,"
Andrus said. "However, the experience in several countries shows that, when
high coverage with measles-containing vaccine exists, reliable detection
and aggressive follow-up of suspect cases will limit the consequences of
measles virus importations." In the World Cup, which starts [9 Jun 2006],
teams from Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, and the
United States are playing in the North Rhine-Westphalia region where cases
have been reported.
Travelers who have no vaccination record are being advised to obtain
measles-containing vaccines, preferably as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) or
measles-rubella (MR), ideally at least 2 weeks before leaving for Europe,
depending on their country's immunization schedules.
PAHO, which works to improve health and raise living standards in all the
countries of the Americas, was successful in eradicating polio from the
Western Hemisphere in 1994.

[As mentioned in earlier postings, this seems to be a year with significant
measles transmission in Europe (see prior postings below). In ProMED-mail
posting Measles - Germany (02): 2005 20060425.1207, Dr Burkhard Rieke
reminded ProMED-mail readers that the ongoing measles outbreak in Germany
should be taken seriously with respect to possible transmission to
international attendees of the upcoming World Cup in Germany. The above
alert from PAHO is yet another forceful reminder of the risks of possible
international spread of measles related to this event. Overall, more
reminders that we live in a global village, and that disease outbreaks can
easily be transported from one part of the world to another in a matter of
hours. Microbial agents do not require visas. - Mod.MPP]
