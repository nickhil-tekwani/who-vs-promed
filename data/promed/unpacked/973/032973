contracted the disease this year, twice as many as at this time in 1997. In
1997, 226 of the 107,000 people who contracted the virus died. [Mortality
rate in each year is 0.2% - Mod.CHC

August and September. Hospitals in some provinces were reporting
overcrowding, with three patients sharing a single bed at some hospitals.
