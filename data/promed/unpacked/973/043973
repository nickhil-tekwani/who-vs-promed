2 siblings die of suspected bird flu in Jakarta
-----------------------------------------------
JAKARTA: 2 teenagers from the same family have died within 10 days because
of suspected bird flu in Jakarta, prompting health officials to take blood
test of the other members of the family, local press said on Wednesday [14
May 2008].

A 16 year old girl died 4 days after being admitted to the Persahabatan
Hospital in the Indonesian capital on May 8 with laboratory test later
confirming she had the avian flu virus. She had been treated at the
isolated room exclusively for bird flu patients but doctors failed to save
her life, reported leading news website Detikcom.

Ten days before her death, her 15 year old brother died after a brief
treatment at another hospital with symptoms similar to bird flu. "The
symptoms were just the same: high fever, cough and faint. We thought it was
the common [seasonal] flu so he didn't stay at the hospital, but then he
died," the father of the ill-fated teenagers, said. But it cannot be
confirmed that bird flu had caused the boy's death as he didn't take a
blood test.

The family live in a densely populated neighborhood where a nearby house
rears chickens.

Apart from the 2 cases, Indonesia has so far confirmed 133 bird flu cases
in human with 107 deaths since the virus was first reported in 2003.
