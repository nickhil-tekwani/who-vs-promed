The last thing he was expecting during his family's vacation on the Chesapeake Bay was to almost lose a leg to an aggressive bacterium growing in the brackish waters. "I've grown up on the bay my whole life, and I'm 66," said the man propped up in a bed at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, his right leg stretched out, swathed in bandages. "I'd never even heard about it."

_Vibrio vulnificus_, of the same family as the cholera bacterium, is a rapid-spreading flesh-eating bacterium that naturally occurs in saltwater or estuaries, particularly from May to October. "We might be seeing more of it, since it is getting warmer," said Ligia Pic-Aluas, an epidemiologist at MedStar Washington.

Total reported vibrio infections in Maryland hit a 10-year high of 57 last year [2013] vs 25 in 2002, according to the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. 6 cases of _V. vulnificus_ infection have been reported in 2014, according to the Maryland Department of Health. In 2013, there were 14. The CDC reports an average of 50 confirmed cases, 45 hospitalizations, and 16 deaths each year along the Gulf Coast, where the pathogen is most common, and nationwide as many as 95 confirmed cases, 85 hospitalizations, and 35 deaths.

The Calvert County Health Department, which has issued a _V. vulnificus_ alert, confirmed 5 infections around the Chesapeake Bay this summer [2014]. "It is likely that over the next few decades, if global warming continues, the vibrio will start to multiply in the tidal waters of the bay earlier in 2014 and will persist later into the fall and possibly the winter," said Laurence Polsky, health officer at the Calvert County Health Department. "This will increase the number of people exposed to the bacterium over the course of the year, and the result will be a higher average number of cases as each decade passes."

Two species of _Vibrio_, _vulnificus_ and _parahaemolyticus_, can be picked up from eating raw seafood, particularly oysters, causing symptoms similar to food poisoning. In high-risk areas, thorough cooking of all shellfish is recommended. Vulnificus can cause an invasive infection of the skin when even a small cut or graze is exposed to water containing the bacterium. The 1st symptoms include redness or swelling of the skin, followed by lesions.

Those who harvest oysters are particularly at risk because they frequently cut their hands and legs on the sharp shells and rocks. For most people, the bacteria usually cause only a mild skin infection or upset stomach, but in people over 60 and those with weakened immune systems or compromised liver function, the bacteria can advance rapidly, infecting and killing tissue, and eventually entering the blood stream and causing sepsis. If not treated quickly, a severe infection can result in amputation of limbs or death.

_V. vulnificus_ blood infections in people with liver disease are fatal in approximately 50 percent of cases, according to the CDC.

[The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration), at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and is associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH [acidity], salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination), and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can include more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
