Mumps is spreading among young adults in Calgary, local health
officials confirmed Thursday [15 Nov 2007], as they unveiled a racy
marketing campaign aimed at combating the viral disease. Dr. Judy
MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health for the Calgary Health
Region, said 19 cases of the mumps have been identified in
Calgary-area patients in the past month and a half, bringing the
total number of cases so far this year [2007] to 33. That's a
significant increase over 6 confirmed cases in all of 2006.

The new Calgary mumps cases come as Lethbridge also battles an
outbreak of the illness in post-secondary students. At least 27
people in the southern Alberta city, most of them at the city's
university and college, have suspected or confirmed cases of the
mumps.

In Calgary, students will be told about upcoming vaccination clinics
through a controversial advertising campaign that was used in Nova
Scotia, where there was a mumps outbreak earlier this year [2007].
One of the posters depicts a pair of flaming basketballs, an apparent
reference to testicular swelling and pain common to the disease.

The mumps is a virus that causes fever and facial [parotid gland]
swelling. The disease can lead to inflammation of the testes and, in
rare cases, infertility and serious brain infections.

[The reappearance of mumps in Western Canada (the province of
Alberta) following its earlier resurgence this year (2007) in Eastern
Canada (the provinces of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island) is a
consequence of past deficiencies in vaccination coverage and
efficacy. This has left a small number of young adults of
post-secondary and college age without adequate protection against
this potentially dangerous infection. Vaccination programmes are in
progress to address the situation. Fortunately, there have been no
reports so far of serious disability following recovery from mumps
virus infection in these age-groups in the current outbreaks.
