Chikungunya [virus infection] is suspected to have resurfaced in Ganjam district with several persons in Boxipalli village reporting its clinical symptoms. It can only be confirmed after laboratory tests, doctors said on Tuesday [21 Aug 2012] after visiting Boxipalli.

"A team of doctors led by district malaria officer (DMO) Uma Shankar Mishra along with the paramedics visited Boxipalli on Monday [20 Aug 2012] and collected the blood samples," official sources said. The blood samples of 5 persons were sent to MKCG Medical College and Hospital. These samples will also be tested for malaria.

An outbreak of chikungunya in Boxipalli, a predominantly fishing village, was reported 2 days ago [19 Aug 2012], when a number of people were suffering from fever with joint pain. Doctors said during their visit they did not find any fever cases but people with joint pain. Fishermen had reported similar symptoms in May [2012] but the blood samples tested negative for chikungunya [virus infections].

However, 9 chikungunya cases were reported in Golabandh, another fishermen dominated village, in April [2012]. "Out of 22 blood samples from Golabandh, 9 tested positive," a senior doctor said.

[Chikungunya virus is endemic in India, and cases appear sporadically in diverse locations, such as the Ganjam district. If the chikungunya virus vector mosquitoes, _Aedes aegypti_, are present, as is likely, and if the cases prove to be chikungunya virus infections, the occurrence of additional cases can be expected. There is no commercially available chikungunya virus vaccine. - Mod.TY
