Initial tests on people who had been in contact with the country's latest
human case of avian influenza have cooled fears of a human-to-human
outbreak, though it remains unclear how the infection was transmitted. None
of the blood samples drawn from people who had contact with the 5 year old
boy from Nakhon Nayok who died last week has tested positive.
The boy tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza virus, said Dr Phaijitr
Varachit, director-general of the Medical Sciences Department. A total of
27 people who had physical contact with the boy are still under
observation. They include the boy's parents, doctors, and friends who had
played with him before he fell ill, said Dr Sompong Boonsuepchat, health
chief officer of Nakhon Nayok. For the moment, all of them appear to be in
good health, he said. As such, Phaijitr said the department was unlikely to
conduct another blood test to detect H5N1 antibodies.
The doctor conceded, however, that it usually takes 2-3 weeks to detect
whether a person has contracted H5N1 virus infection. Only the parents,
especially the mother, were considered [potentially] high-risk cases. She
had been closely nursing the boy, said Sompong, who added she sometimes
kissed the child's cheeks. So far, the mother appeared to be healthy,
Sompong said.
In the wake of the latest human case, Nakhon Nayok's public health office
had ordered all private clinics to contact state hospitals quickly about
suspected cases and refrain from attempting to treat them, the doctor said.
The boy victim had been taken to 2 private clinics that mistook his
symptoms for something else. They were partly to blame for the delay in
bringing the boy to a proper hospital, where he might have been saved.
Another suspected child case from a nearby village was found to have
contracted H3N2 [human] influenza virus infection and not [H5N1] avian
influenza, Sompong said.
Meanwhile, the Livestock Development Department said it would track the
cause of the boy's infection. It found no signs of the virus in the poultry
near the victim's house. "It looks frightening. The chicken didn't die but
the boy did. This is an issue that needs investigation and clear answers,"
Yukol Limlamthong, the department's director-general, said.
Sompong said pigeons might be the source of the infection, dismissing the
possibility of human-to-human transmission. There were many pigeons around
the boy's house and [H5N1 avian influenza virus] might have been present in
the birds' faeces, he said.

[Throughout the course of the outbreak of H5N1 avian influenza in East
Asia, human cases of infection have been infrequent in relation to the
number of individuals potentially at risk. Onward person-to-person
transmission of H5N1 avian virus has been rare if it has occurred at all.
In the above report the environmental source of the boy's infection has not
been established unequivocally, and it is suggested that delayed
recognition of the cause of the child's condition and inappropriate
treatment may have contributed to the fatal outcome. It would be useful to
pursue this question further to establish whether genetic predisposition or
environmental circumstances played the predominant role in bringing about
the boy's death. - Mod.CP]
