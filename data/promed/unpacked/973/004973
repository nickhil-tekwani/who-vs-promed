["Viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS) is a disease of farmed rainbow trout, farmed turbot, farmed Japanese flounder, as well as a broad range of wild freshwater and marine species caused by VHSV, a virus belonging to the genus _Novirhabdovirus_ within the family Rhabdoviridae.

"Diseased fish may display nonspecific clinical signs in the early stages of infection, including rapid onset of mortality (which can reach up to 100% in fry), lethargy, darkening of the skin, exophthalmia, anaemia (pale gills), haemorrhages at the base of the fins, gills, eyes and skin, and a distended abdomen due to oedema in the peritoneal cavity. In the chronic state of infection, affected fish do not in general exhibit external signs. VHS can also occur in a nervous form, characterised by severe abnormal swimming behaviour, such as constant flashing and/or spiralling.

"During the past 2 decades, VHSV has been isolated from wild fish throughout the temperate area of the Northern Hemisphere, both in fresh- and marine waters. VHS outbreaks in farmed rainbow trout have, however, only been experienced in Europe, where it is still considered to be one of the most serious viral diseases in aquaculture. In America, VHS primarily causes mortality in wild fish. In Asia, there have been reports of clinical outbreaks in farmed Japanese flounder as well as isolations from wild fish species."
