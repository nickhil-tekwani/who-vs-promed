Poliomyelitis in Indonesia - update 11 -- 21 July 2005
------------------------------------------------------
On 19 Jul 2005, 4 new polio cases were confirmed in districts already
infected: Bogor (West Java province) and Lebak (Banten province). The total
number of cases is now 153.
These new cases are within the areas included during the 2 emergency
vaccination campaigns held on 31 May and 28 June, but with onset between
the rounds. Plans are under way for National Immunization Days targeting
24.4 million children under 5 years old throughout the country on 30 Aug
[2005] and 27 Sep [2005].

[This present update represents an increase of 31 confirmed cases since our
last update on 8 Jul 2005 (from 122 cases to 153 cases today -- see refs
below). Given the identification of 2 cases of polio on Sumatra island, the
decision to have national immunization days is wise. We do not know how
many additional suspected cases are pending confirmation, so it is
difficult to assess whether transmission was interrupted in some of the
affected areas (the dates of onset of the 4 new cases mentioned above were
between 31 May and 28 Jun 2005, approximately 3 weeks ago). - Mod.MPP]
