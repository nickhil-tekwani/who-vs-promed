Melbourne..Victoria, AU 22 March 1997
More than 100 people have become seriously ill after eating Vietnamese pork
rolls from a bakery on Saturday, according to the chief health officer of
Victoria.
Nine people including two seven year olds, and two people in their 70`s were
rushed to hospital with acute gastroentertis. Health officers had traced the
contamination to a Hotbread shop in outer Springvale. The shop was forced to
stop trading at 5pm yesterday. At this stage the organism responsible has
not been determined. More than 100 people have been treated at Monash
Medical Centre, the Dandenong Hospital and by local doctors. Most of the $2
pork rolls had been consumed by Saturday lunchtime, it
appears that the contamination is linked to the pork, which was brought in
and prepared on site.It was stated that some heat treatment was carried out
but was not
carefully or adequately done.
It was stated that no link has been established with the salmonella muenchen
outbreak that caused the deaths last month of a 79 year old man and an 86
year old women and the infection of another 29 people after eating
salmonella-contaminated meat.
This report appeared in the West Australian Newspaper, PERTH Western
Australia on Monday 24 March 1997.

News Item from the "Australian" Newspaper 24.3.1997
It was reported in today's "Australian" newspaper that nine people have been
admitted to hospital - one into intensive care - and more than 100 people
treated for food poisoning after eating contaminated pork rolls from a
bakery in the south-east of Melbourne, Victoria this weekend (22nd and 23rd
March 1997).
Two days after health officials revealed two people had died and 29 had been
poisoned by meat products last month, Victoria's chief medical officer, Dr
Graham Rouch, said yesterday the latest outbreak was dramatic but easy to
isolate.
Dr Rouch said it was still unclear whether the contamination was caused at
the World Hotbread shop in Springvale or came from pork supplies.
The alarm was raised when people began flooding into local hospitals and
medical centres late on Saturday night.
Monash Medical Centre informed the Department of Human Services at 1.30pm
yesterday. The Vietnamese shop was closed at 5pm.
"This is acute gastroenteritis, quite a severe form...at this present time,
and these are provisional figures, we believe there are over 100 cases," Dr
Rouch said.
"There may still be cases out there that are yet to present and we encourage
anyone with this severe form of food poisoning to seek medical advice quite
soon, particularly if they have any blood passing in their motion,"
Dr Rouch said the bacteria was quite distinct from the salmonella Muenchen"
identified as the bacterium reponsible for the Lago Smallgoods salmonella
outbreak.
"It may turn out to be the bacterium from the same family, it may not, it's
too early to tell at this stage," Dr Rouch said.
Two children, two elderly people and five adults were admitted to hospital,
but since then two adults have been discharged.
A council inspector was at the premises late last night. Authorities said
legal action was under way against the bakery for a previous incident.
Following the revelation the State Opposition stepped up its calls for a
judicial inquiry into outbreaks and delays in reporting the contaminations
to the public.
Health spokesman Mr John Thwaites said the inquiry was needed to determine
if the 1994 deregulation of the State's meat inspection system was to blame
for the deaths.
"The Opposition has been saying for two years that there are increased risks
to public health because of deregulation," he said.
Speaking before the latest outbreak was revealed, the Minister for Health,
Mr Knowles, defended the inspection system saying Victoria was "at the
forefront" in the development of food safety standards, while the Premier,
Mr Kennett, described the calls for an inquiry as "sheer stupidity."
A spokeswoman for the Government said late last night there would not be any
comment on the latest outbreak.
Concerns have been raised about the time taken by Department of Human
Services to release information to the public after suspecting a salmonella
outbreak as early as mid-February.
An 86 year old woman, Laura Peirce, died from the poisoning on March 7,
while a 79 year old man died in late February.
The dead woman's son, Mr Vernon Peirce, is considering legal action.
End.
+Postcript One: There is a recall notice for the small goods mentioned as
having been possibly linked to the deaths of the two elderly people and
sickness in approximately 30 other people from salmonella in this paper
today (24.3.97)
+++Postcript Two.On ABC Radio National today, the report of the 100 new
cases of food poisoning was discussed and it was noted (and quite rightly
so) that a co-ordinated national approach in Australia would be appreciated
by the general public in the case of food poisoning outbreaks etc rather
than a state by state approach. Better communication between the states and
faster notification to the public of outbreaks of food poisoning was desirable.
