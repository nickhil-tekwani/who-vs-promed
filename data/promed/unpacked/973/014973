[A 4th province of the Casablanca-Settat region, that of Berrechid, has been affected by the current epizootic of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Morocco, and is added to the list including, in chronological order, the provinces Sidi Bennour, El Jadida and Settat.

Note that on 6 outbreaks registered to date, 4 were found in mixed farms rearing cattle and sheep and that FMD symptoms have been observed only in cattle, although this species was subject to preventive vaccination campaign, unlike sheep.

Beyond the losses caused by the disease, the epidemic has pushed Spain, northern neighbor of Morocco, to prohibit, today [20 Nov 2015] the importation of live animals and animal products from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. This ban, which also applies to the 2 Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, on African soil, does not extend to fishery products nor to horses which will be admitted under certain health conditions (see: http://www.h24info.ma/maroc/fievre-aphteuse-lespagne-interdit-les-animaux-en-provenance-du-maroc/38332 [in French]).

While Spain does not officially import any animals from these 4 countries, many Moroccans have family members in Spain and occasionally bring with them meat dishes and dairy products, especially during festive periods.

The presence of FMD in Morocco is considered as an "imminent" risk for the introduction of the disease into countries of the European Union, which have the status of 'FMD free countries without vaccination', according to OIE criteria. - Mod.AB

The summarized OIE statistics since the start of this epizootic (23 Oct 2015) are as follows:
Total outbreaks = 6 (Submitted)
Species/ Susceptible/ Cases/ Deaths/ Destroyed/ Slaughtered
Cattle/ 82/ 27/ 0/ 82/ 0
Sheep/ 115/ 0/ 0/ 115/ 0

The said report, with a map showing the 6 outbreaks, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000019135_20151120_183051.pdf.

Genotyping results of the FMDV-O strain, currently circulating in Morocco, are not (yet) available. - Mod.AS
