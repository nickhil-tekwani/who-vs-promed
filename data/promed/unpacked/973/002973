The bacterium causing hemolytic uremic syndrome has been found in dogs from
Buenos Aires and its surroundings, according to an investigation presented
at the Argentinean Infectious Diseases Congress.
Research carried out by the Center for Research in Infectious Diseases
Foundation (FUNCEI, according to its Spanish initials, Fundacion Centro de
Estudios Infectologicos) found dogs in Buenos Aires and its metropolitan
area carrying _E. coli_ O157:H7, which is the main cause of hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS), a condition that most frequently affects children
less than 5 years old, causing severe blood vessel and other target organ
damage, and it may even lead to death.
"Isolating this bacterium both in healthy adult carriers as well as in
colonized but not sick dogs is an important finding," said Dr. Viviana
Gallego, infectious disease specialist from FUNCEI and one of the authors
of the study. With this evidence, it is necessary to take more precautions
in order to avoid transmission. A child can acquire the infection from
his/her mother, if she is a healthy carrier, maybe because she fixes foods
without proper handwashing; from his/her dog, with whom he/she may play or
even sleep; from any place in a public area (e.g. a park) contaminated with
dogs' stools. It is not only a matter of properly cooking meat or
disinfecting fruits and vegetables. Sanitary authorities should widen
preventive recommendations.
Argentina has the highest incidence of HUS in the world, 400 cases per
year, 7 times higher compared to other affected countries. _E. coli_
O157:H7 is the prototype shiga toxin-producing bacteria (STEC) detected in
asymptomatic adults as well as in dogs and cats assessed in this study.
"With studies such as ours, we are detecting other transmission sources in
addition to cattle (the most frequently found reservoir) or contaminated
food, which is the main vehicle for this microorganism," added Dr. Gallego.
"As long as we do not know where the microorganism is, we may not be able
to identify and prevent risky contacts."
The investigation, which was carried out by FUNCEI's Alimentary Hygiene
Study and Research Group (GEIHA, according to its Spanish initials), was
presented during the VI Argentinean Congress organized by the Argentinean
Society for Infectious Diseases, which recently took place in Mar del Plata.
"STEC bacteria were found both in asymptomatic adults as well as in dogs
and in some cats," explained Dr. Horacio Repetto, Pediatrics Chief at
Posadas Hospital and also one of the authors of the study. "We already knew
that these bacteria living within the human intestine may be able to infect
children, but the question was whether transmission of canine bacteria also
occurs."
There are 400 000 dogs that generate 68 tons of stools per day in Buenos
Aires. This means 2.7 tons of contaminated stools per day on sidewalks,
streets and parks in the city.
The study assessed 150 asymptomatic adults and their pets, 126 dogs and 24
cats, between July 2005 and February 2006. Stool samples were taken, and
isolated _E. coli_ were analyzed. STEC prevalence in humans was 4.7
percent, the corresponding figures for dogs and cats were 4 percent and 4.2
percent, respectively. "In 2 dogs, _E. coli_ O157:H7 was isolated, the same
microorganism causing diarrheal disease or HUS in humans, with all
pathogenicity factors present," reported Dr. Gallego.
"It was considered as an almost specific feature that it was able to cause
disease in dogs but not in humans. In Argentina, we found bacteria in dogs
that caused disease in humans, and these microorganisms were found in
contaminated foods," added Dr. Gallego.

[ProMED apologizes for posting this report (from last month, June 2006) at
this time, but we just became aware of it. The presence of _E. coli_ O157
in companion animals such as dogs, cats and birds (or other non-O157 STEC
isolates) has been looked at before, and ProMED has previous posted on it
in 2001 (see below).
In one study (1), all companion animal (pigs, dogs, parrot and iguanas (n =
48)) isolates of _E. coli_ O157 strains were Shiga-toxin negative. In
another (2), the toxin producing strains from healthy companion animals
constituted a very heterogeneous group of _E. coli_, and many appeared to
be specific for their hosts. The absence of eae (attaching and effacing)
sequences in most animal STEC strains was felt to indicate that these
strains are less virulent for humans than the classical eae-positive
enterohemorrhagic types. The Shiga- like toxin II genes were frequent in
these strains, were, however, found in strains from healthy dogs, but were
rarely found in isolates from other animals.
Disease can occur in companion animals, however, as experimental
inoculation of dogs was found to cause an illness similar to hemolytic
uremic syndrome in a non-O157 STEC strain (3).
To this point, however, Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ disease in dogs,
cats or birds has not at all been an epidemiologic factor in human cases.
The closeness of dogs and cats to young children in a household would
likely have produced such an association if such transmission occurred
commonly.
