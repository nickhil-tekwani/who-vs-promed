Destructive virus threatens tomato industry
-----------------------------
Mindanao's tomato industry is reportedly being threatened by the
continuing spread of a plant virus that has been destroying tomato
farms in several parts of the island, a government horticultural
scientist said.

Dr. Agapito Cabalquinto, a horticulturist from the state-owned
University of Southern Mindanao, said tomato production in several
parts of northern and central Mindanao has declined over the last 2
years due to infection by Tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV). According
to Cabalquinto, this is a big problem because ToLCV is systemic in
infected tomato plants and once virus symptoms appear, there is no
other choice but to destroy the plants.

Cabalquinto said the ToLCV infection, which reportedly first emerged
in several tomato farms in the country more than 2 years ago, is
expressed mainly by curling of tomato leaves. He said plants which
were hit by the virus no longer have the capacity to bear fruits. On
average, this virus could wipe out at least 20 to 30 percent of
tomato plants per hectare he said.

Diseased plants were recorded on tomato farms hit by ToLCV in
Claveria town in Misamis Oriental in Northern Mindanao. According to
the Department of Agriculture, Northern Mindanao is the 2nd major
producer of tomato in the country, accounting for 13.80 percent of
the country's average annual production of over 150 000 metric tons.
The area also comprises 9.44 percent of the more than 16 000 hectares
of tomato farms in the country. But Cabalquinto said some farmers
based in the province, especially those from Polomolok and Tampakan
towns, have also complained about ToLCV.

A tomato producer from Tampakan said the tomatoes they planted
recently using certified seeds have showed signs of the virus. "This
shows that the virus has been spreading mainly through the seeds that
had been infected," he said.

Cabalquinto said there is ongoing research about measures to control
spread using ToLCV-resistant tomato cultivars. The Agricultural
Biotechnology Support Project II, an initiative of Cornell University
in the United States, has been developing a multiple virus-resistant
tomato for the Philippines and Indonesia.

The project aims to combine near-market transgenic technologies for
Cucumber mosaic cucomovirus with conventional resistance against
ToLCV to produce commercial tomato varieties with multiple virus
resistance within 5 to 7 years. According to Cabalquinto, the project
seeks to assist Indonesian and Philippine organizations in gaining
regulatory approval, licensing the needed intellectual property,
testing the efficacy of resistance against local virus strains,
incorporating the transgenic resistance into local varieties, and
combining that with resistance to the other viruses to generate
commercial multiple-virus-resistant tomato seeds.

ToLCV-resistant lines of tomato against ToLCV have reportedly been
developed and initial efficacy trials of these resistant lines in
Taiwan, Southern India, and Thailand have showed promising results.

[Natural hosts of Tomato leaf curl virus (ToLCV) include tomato,
pepper, eggplant, okra, tobacco, beans, cotton, cucurbits and other
solanaceous crops. ToLCV-infected plants are severely stunted with
shoots becoming erect. Leaflets are reduced in size and tend to
pucker. Leaves curl upwards, become distorted, have prominent yellow
margins, and flowers are withered. The virus is transmitted by
whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_) that are attracted to young leaves and
growing tips. The virus is not transmitted mechanically or via seed.
The statement that ToLCV is spreading through infected seeds is
incorrect; its mode of transmission is by viruliferous whiteflies.

Disease management includes use of healthy transplants, planting of
resistant or tolerant cultivars, and protection of seedlings with
fine meshing (60-mesh or finer) to exclude whiteflies. Several
insecticides such as imidacloprid or esfenvalerate are recommended
and should be rotated to reduce build-up of insecticide-tolerant
whiteflies. Virus sources should be eliminated near the susceptible
crop and a 60-day fallow period should be provided between the old
infected crop and the new crop. - Mod.DH]
