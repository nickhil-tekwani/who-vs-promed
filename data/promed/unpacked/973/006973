[A PCR-based diagnostic method is being used by plant scientists at the
University of Illinois to detect the fungus that causes soybean sudden
death syndrome (SDS). SDS is a mid- to late-season disease caused by a
particular strain of fungus known as
_Fusarium solani_ [f.sp. _glycines_. [Roots of diseased plants may be
symptomless. Affected plants can suffer root rot, crown necrosis and
vascular discoloration of roots and stems, [and crop yields may be reduced
by as much as 70 percent. [The disease is particularly severe this year.
Data from 1998 and 1999 showed that Central Illinois counties had a high
rate of SDS.
The new detection method consistently detected [minute traces of the
SDS-fungus in soil and plant tissues grown in the laboratory and fields
across Illinois. Its presence was found [in samples that were thought to
be free of disease. Researchers also [detected the SDS pathogen in the
presence of 55 non-disease-causing strains of F. solani and 20 other soybean
pathogens. Previous methods relied on the placement of plant roots into a
medium that lacked sensitivity, specificity [and reliability.
The new tool's sensitivity is very precise, said Glen Hartman, professor of
crop sciences and scientist with the USDA-Agriculture Research Service. [He
said, "The detection of this specific fungus is important, because of its
pathological implications compared to all the different fungi that occur in
the soil and in plant roots."

[The development of this diagnostic method should greatly facilitate
management of SDS. It should also be useful in screening soybean lines for
disease susceptibility. Additional information can be obtained at the
