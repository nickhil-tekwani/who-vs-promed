The warm, sunny weather of late has done more than keep people in
short sleeves and flip-flops; it's aiding in the spread of a virus
deadly to deer.
Officials from the Pennsylvania Game Commission had hoped that an
early, hard frost would eradicate "biting midges," the insects
responsible for the spread of epizootic hemorrhagic disease, or EHD,
a virus common in the South that's currently picking off the deer
population in southwestern Pennsylvania.
Already, the game commission has confirmed that the virus has killed
at least 1000 deer around Beaver, Greene, and Washington counties,
but Mel Schake, information and education supervisor for the
southwest region, said that number could be much higher. "I don't
think anyone can comfortably say what it is," he said. "It's in
excess of a thousand."
The department, he said, is powerless to stop the spread of the
virus. Until nature decides to cooperate, the deer population will
continue to decline. "There is nothing we can do to stop or control
EHD. It's a natural event," Schake said. "We're as much at the mercy
of this event as anyone else."
There is some good news: Schake said the EHD virus is not expected to
return to northern states once the [warm] weather ends. Game
commission officials think the biting midges arrived in the area on
the back of freak weather conditions. "Once we get good cold weather,
it will kill these insects," Schake said. "We don't expect to get
more of this next year."
Now for the bad news: The virus is spreading. After outbreaks of EHD
were initially identified in Beaver, Greene, and Washington counties,
Schake said, the virus was confirmed in Allegheny and Westmoreland
counties late last week [17-23 Sep 2007]. The commission also is
awaiting test results to confirm the virus in Cambria County.
"We suspect it might be elsewhere as well, but we have no
confirmation of it," Schake said. "Locally, it has been fairly
devastating to some groups of deer."
Schake said the worst hit areas are in northwest Greene County and
southern Washington County. But even in those regions, Schake said,
the outbreak seems to be limited to certain deer herds. "It's not
throughout Greene County," he said. "It's kind of spotty where it erupts."
That's good news for hunters.
Schake said it might be a little tougher for hunters this year
[2007]. While there are still deer out there, it may take a little
extra work to find them. The regular haunts long scoped out as a
sweet spot for deer by hunters may not exist this year.
"Our advice to hunters is to make sure they do as much preseason
scouting as possible," Schake said. "Don't rely on one area. Hunters
need to be looking for alternate locations."
If the virus continues in the deer population, Schake said, it could
affect the number of hunting licenses the commission issues next year
[2008]. "We've made no changes on anything for this year," he said.
"Beyond that, we'll have to assess what happened and whether or not
to make changes on the allocations of animal licenses."

Dr. Walter Cottrell, Pennsylvania Game Commission wildlife
veterinarian, today [25 Sep 2007] announced that test results of dead
deer have confirmed that epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) has been
found in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties. Results released today
involved an adult female deer that was found dead in Jefferson Hills,
Allegheny County, and an adult female deer that was found dead in St.
Clair Township, Westmoreland County. Other counties in which EHD has
been confirmed are Beaver, Greene, and Washington.
As a reminder, Dr. Cottrell and other agency personnel from the
Southwest Region are holding an informational meeting at 7 p.m.,
Friday [28 Sep 2007] at the Waynesburg Fairgrounds Auction Building,
Greene County, to provide the public with an update on the current outbreak.
The Game Commission has also posted an EHD fact sheet
<http://www.pgc.state.pa.us/pgc/cwp/view.asp?a=465&q=172441>.
EHD is a common but sporadic disease in white-tailed deer populations
of the United States, and is contracted by the bite of insects called
"biting midges."
It is not spread from deer to deer by contact. While EHD is not
infectious to humans, deer displaying severe symptoms of EHD are
usually not suitable for consumption because of the rapid
deterioration of the meat and secondary bacterial infection.
"This outbreak of EHD is more significant than the one in 2002 and
has impacted more deer in a larger area," Dr. Cottrell said in a news
release. The 1st good frost should kill the midges.

Epizootic hemorrhagic disease outbreak update
---------------------------------------------
An outbreak of epizootic hemorrhagic disease (EHD) in wild
white-tailed deer, caused by an RNA virus transmitted by biting
midges, began in the last week of August [2007] and 1st week of
September [2007] in New Jersey. It was investigated on 7 Sep 2007 by
the Division's Office of Fish and Wildlife Health and Forensics
(OFWHF) and deer project personnel when 15 deer were reportedly found
by hunters scouting their hunting property comprising slightly less
than 500 acres (202 hectares) in Hillsborough Township, north of
Amwell road, west of Millstone in Somerset County.
Several deer carcasses were found in varying states of decomposition.
A [recently dead] fawn found at the site showed gross lesions
consistent with EHD (blue tongue, hemorrhaged conjunctiva of the eye,
congested hemorrhagic lungs) and was collected for postmortem
examination. Spleen and serum samples collected from the deer were
submitted to Dr. David Stallknecht at the Southeast Cooperative
Wildlife Disease Research Study at the University of Georgia for
virus isolation and typing.
A search of one mile (1.6 km) of the Royce Brook, the main drainage
near the hunting property, by wildlife toxicologist and the wildlife
pathologist on 12 Sep 2007 found 8 more deer, which had been dead
approximately one week. On 19 Sep 2007 the diagnosis of EHD was
confirmed with the isolation of serotype 2 EHD virus. A recumbent
buck emitting fluid from the mouth was shot and reported to the
pathologist by Hillsborough police. It was found just south of Amwell
road and had lesions consistent with peracute EHD. Samples from that
deer were sent for virus typing on 20 Sep 2007.
On 17 Sep 2007 the wildlife pathologist, investigated 12 deer deaths
that hunters reported along the Manantico River drainage in
Cumberland County. 2 additional deer were found not previously
reported by the hunters. All deer appeared to have been dead for one
to 2 weeks. Additional anecdotal evidence of 6 dead deer found by
hunters on another nearby drainage of Mud creek north of Union Lake
in Pittsgrove Twp. was received but not investigated, since the deer
were also reportedly one to 2 weeks old. Deer dead for more than 24
hours are unsuitable for virus isolation. Hunters were asked to
immediately report any symptomatic or newly dead deer in the area.
A report of dead deer seen by fishermen floating in the Salem Canal
near Carneys Point in Salem County around the 1st week of September
[2007] was reminiscent of the 1st reports of the 1999 EHD outbreak in
Salem County. This was again well after the fact and no samples could
be collected.
A 4th report of approximately 15 dead deer found by canoeists on the
Mullica River in Wharton State Park near Hammonton and Shamong was
received by Central Law on 23 Sep 2007 and will be investigated. The
carcasses were reportedly found by smell.
This is the 1st time serotype 2 EHD has been found in New Jersey. In
all previous outbreaks, in 1955 (Passaic River Drainage), 1975
(Paulinskill, Pequest River Drainages), and 1999 (Salem River,
Rancocas River Drainages), type 1 was isolated. An estimated 4000
deer died in the 1999 outbreak. Serotype 2 is commonly isolated from
deer in Southern Florida, Texas, and Mexico. Deer in these areas may
have no clinical illness or mortalities. This may be due to their
genetic innate resistance, the lower virulence of the strain of EHD
virus and immunity from previous exposures. The deer in northern
states appear to be more susceptible to experimental exposures and
deer infected with serotype 1 do not develop immunity to serotype 2
and visa versa.
The locations and seasons of EHD outbreaks are more dependent on the
density and distribution of the midges than the density of the deer
herd. One species of midge (_Culiocoides sonorensis_ previously named
_C. variipennis_) has been identified as a vector of EHD in North
America, although about 11 species may have the potential to transmit
it. Suspect midges were found and collected at the Hillsborough site
on mud flats, which serve as a prime-breeding habitat. Cold weather
will terminate midge activity and the EHD epizootic.
Identification of the cause of these outbreaks through virus
isolation is important since the lesions and signs may mimic
potential foreign animal diseases like foot-and-mouth disease,
heartwater fever, rinderpest, and adenovirus hemorrhagic disease. EHD
may have a very short course with few signs (peracute), a longer
period of clinical disease (acute) or a protracted course (chronic).
The virus reaches maximum numbers in the blood of the deer 6 to 7
days after a bite by an infected midge and can circulate in the blood
as long as 56 days if the deer doesn't die. The virus causes blood
clots and damage to the linings of the blood vessels causing leakage
of serum and hemorrhages. Deer, which survive the infection, may
develop ridges or bands on the hooves and in more severe chronic
cases they may slough the hooves and develop secondary infections
becoming lame and emaciated.
Deer with EHD in the fall are not usually emaciated. Sick deer from
August through October, which are unable to stand and are drooling or
emitting foam from the mouth and nose, could be suffering from EHD.
Similarly those found dead in the water or near the water with no
apparent wounds should be suspect EHD cases and the OFWHF should be
notified immediately by calling 908-735-6398 or the nearest DFW
(Division of Fish & Wildlife) Regional Office.

[Most of the outbreaks have been EHD serotype 1. Now we have a
different serotype in New Jersey. Although EHD normally affects deer,
it can affect cattle. Diseases such as EHD are rule-out diseases for
foreign animal diseases and could, in some cases, be rule outs for
such diseases as anthrax. It is certainly important for states to
verify the cause of these die-offs. - Mod.TG]
