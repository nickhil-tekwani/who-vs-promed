Diarrhoea Kills Seven in Mali
------------------------------------
A diarrhoea epdemic has killed 7 people in Koury and Diena
localities of Yorosso prefecture, about 500 km south of
Bamako, Mali News Agency, AMAP, reported.
The agency said a medical team has been dispatched to the two
area to treat patients and conduct analyses of stool to determine
the origin of the disease, which the population associates with
cholera.
But the Sikasso regional medical officer, Dr Oumar Bah, has said
the disease was caused by the breach of certain hygienic
regulations by the population, particularly the conservation of food.
Bah also said the areas affected lacked bore holes, forcing the
population to drink contaminated water. He mentioned the lack of
latrines and conservation of cooked food for two to three days as
other possible causes of the diarrhoea.
A permanent medical surveillance team has been sent to the two
villages to sensitise the population about ways to prevent related
diseases.
