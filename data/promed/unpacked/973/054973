_Meloidogyne enterolobii_ (EPPO A2 List) has been reported for the 1st time from India. The nematode was detected in guava (_Psidium guajava_) orchards showing sudden decline in Tamil Nadu.

[Root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ species) attack a wide range of plants and cause significant economic losses in many vegetable and fruit crops. The genus contains around 70 species and is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions in many types of soil. Symptoms may include stunting, wilting and leaf chlorosis; large galls are formed throughout the root system affecting plant vigour and even killing the host. Affected plants may show increased sensitivity to other bacterial or fungal pathogens.

The nematodes can persist in the soil for may years and are spread by plant material, soil and mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures, nematicides, and use of resistant crop varieties.

_M. enterolobii_ (synonym _M. mayaguensis_) is polyphagous and, although its precise host range is still unknown, has been found on many economically important crops including guava, potato, coffee, soybean, sweet potato, melons and a range of vegetables. While it originates in subtropical areas, it also poses a serious threat to glasshouse crops in cooler regions. It is considered an emerging and particularly aggressive pathogen with increased virulence against crop varieties resistant to other root knot nematodes. For example, it is able to reproduce on capsicum, watermelon, tobacco and tomato varieties (including root stocks) resistant to other _Meloidogyne_ species.

In Tamil Nadu, guava is cultivated on a large scale and this decline due to _M. enterolobii_ is considered an emerging disease (see link below). Symptoms on young guava trees are described as yellowing, shredding of leaves, drying of branches, reduced tree vigour, and loss of productivity. Trees may be killed within 3 months of first symptoms. For disease management, pesticides, biocontrol with a fungal nematode egg parasite (_Purpureocillium lilacinum_), additional fertilisers and use of certified clean seedlings for replanting are recommended. The species had previously not been reported from India and an introduction with planting material is suspected.
