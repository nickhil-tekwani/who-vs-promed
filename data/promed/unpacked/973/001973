Rabies outbreaks - Eastern Cape, South Africa
---------------------------------------------
There has been an outbreak of rabies in dogs in 2 districts in the
Eastern Cape, South Africa. 2 of the cases came from Ugie in the
Ukhahlamba district and 2 from Cumakala (Near Lady Frere) in the
Chris Hani district.

Cases from Ugie:
----------------
The 1st case was brought to the attention of the Dept of Agriculture
(Maclear) after the owner had noted his dog had 'all the symptoms of
rabies.' Human contact included normal handling and saliva contact,
but no bite wounds. The dog was vaccinated but the date was unknown.

The 2nd case was a stray dog which had bitten one human and other
animals. It is unclear if the dogs died by themselves or were
euthanased.

Cases from Cumakala:
--------------------
The 1st case was noted by an animal health technician after the dog
showed abnormal behaviour. The animal was 6 months old and was not
vaccinated. The animal died by itself.

The 2nd case was from the same premises about 2 days after the 1st.
It displayed strange howling behaviour and xerostomia, and was
euthanised. Five other dogs on the premises were also euthanised
after confirmation of results. There were no human contacts according
to the owner.

Results were confirmed by the Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute on
30 and 31 July 2008.

Vaccination and awareness campaigns are being organised, and human
exposures will be followed up.
