[Media sources from 3 Nov 2018 are reporting a growing number of "smallpox" cases in coastal areas of Hajjah governorate, Yemen, including in [Aslam, Abas, and Khiran Muharraq], as well as in refugee camps. The reports refer to the "smallpox" as a skin disease that is spreading quickly, with symptoms including severe itching accompanied by severe diarrhea, which may lead to death. The reports include pictures of a single case, who is the sibling of a deceased individual. An image of a signed death certificate (presumably that of the deceased individual) on 28 Oct 2018, describes the final diagnosis as 'varicella' [chickenpox] with a 2nd word that may be 'disseminated', implying a severe clinical presentation of varicella due to immunodeficiency. In response to questions about this outbreak, ProMED received the letter below. - Mod.DK]

In week 43 [week ending (w/e) 26 Oct 2018] there are 485 reported cases of chickenpox that constitute 0.2% of all reported cases for the week.

- These reported cases are only based on clinical diagnosis and meeting the suspected case definition as we do not have lab tests for confirmation in Yemen
- Nearly all 23 governorates -- except 2 -- are reporting chickenpox in week 43, with [cases ranging from 1 to 81]; 35 cases have been reported from Hajjah governorates (where your reports are coming from).
- The number of alerts in W 43 which -- around 25 -- is similar to previous weeks
- Sometimes we received similar alerts referring to smallpox but on investigation it was always found to be chickenpox.
- Aslam district (where the reports you mentioned are coming from)
is recently reported to have one of the highest rates of malnutrition rates in Yemen and severe poverty is overwhelming (see recent reports about Aslam in the news at https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-in-a-remote-district-of-yemen-starving-families-eat-leaves-to-survive/). Therefore, it is not surprising to have a diagnosis of "disseminated" illness and that deaths could occur.
