Reading the interesting letter on quarantine of dogs, I would like to
remember that the transmission of leishmania from dogs to humans would be
very difficult in Britain, because there are no phlebotomine sandflies in
these islands. However, the venereal transmission of the parasites would be
possible.

As far as we are aware, _Leishmania_ sp. is only transmitted by adult
sandflies (sub-family _Phlebotominae_), usually by their bite, possibly
also by squashing a fly on the skin. We are not aware of any evidence of
venereal transmission. Although Britain has no reservoir of sandflies at
present, it is possible that global warming might make our climate suitable
for their survival in the future.
