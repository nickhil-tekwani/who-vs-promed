The New Mexico Department of Health announced today [10 Dec 2013] that a 12-year-old boy from McKinley County died of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). This is the 3rd case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in New Mexico this year [2013] and the 2nd death. An environmental investigation will be conducted at the home of the patient to help reduce the risk to others.

Hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] is a deadly disease transmitted by infected rodents through urine, droppings or saliva. People can contract the disease when they breathe in aerosolized virus. The deer mouse [_Peromyscus maniculatus_] is the main reservoir for Sin Nombre virus, the hantavirus strain most commonly found in New Mexico.

"People are usually exposed to hantavirus[es] around their homes, especially when they clean out enclosed areas that have lots of mouse droppings," said Dr. Paul Ettestad, the Department of Health's public health veterinarian. "With the cold weather, mice may try to enter buildings for shelter, so it is important to seal up homes and other structures that are used by people. Mice can squeeze through holes the size of a dime."

Early symptoms of [a] hantavirus infection include fever and muscle aches, possibly with chills, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and cough, which progresses to respiratory distress. These symptoms develop within 1-6 weeks after rodent exposure [leading to infection].

Although there is no specific treatment for HPS, chances for recovery are better if medical attention is sought early.

Important steps to follow to prevent contracting hantavirus [infections] include:
- Air out closed-up buildings before entering.
- Trap mice until they are all gone.
- Clean up nests and droppings using a disinfectant.
- Don't sweep up rodent droppings into the air where they can be inhaled.
- Put hay, wood, and compost piles as far as possible from your home.
- Get rid of trash and junk piles.
- Don't leave your pet's food and water where mice can get to it.

The previous 2013 New Mexico hantavirus infections were in a 45-year-old woman from McKinley County who survived and a 73-year-old woman from Santa Fe County who died in October 2013.

In 2012, New Mexico had one case of [a] hantavirus [infection], which resulted in the death of a 20-year-old woman from Rio Arriba County. In 2011, New Mexico had 5 cases of hantavirus [infections]. Of the 5 cases, 3 were fatal, including a 51-year-old woman from McKinley County, a 35-year-old man from Torrance County, and a 23-year-old man from McKinley County.

Since it was 1st discovered in 1993, New Mexico has had a total of 94 lab-confirmed hantavirus [infection] cases with 39 deaths, the highest number of cases for any state in the nation.

Nationally, since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported a total of 624 cases with a fatality rate of 36 per cent.

[The rodent host of Sin Nombre virus is _Peromyscus maniculatus_, which is widely distributed in North America and frequently invades houses, especially during cold, winter weather.

A Gualeguaychu hospital confirmed a death due to [a] hantavirus [infection] and not from dengue, which was suspected initially. The neighboring areas where the man lived were fumigated [presumably for mosquitoes? - Mod.TY]

The death of a man in the Centenario Hospital, announced this past Wed 4 Dec 2013, generated concern by the health authorities, since the victim presented with symptoms of those who have dengue.

Following the tests that were carried out, it was established that it was a case of [a] hantavirus [infection], given the symptoms that the patient presented with. After having received [this case] with a clinical course "suspicious" of dengue, samples were sent from the Centenario Hospital to the headquarters of Epidemiology in Entre Rios, where they were tested to know exactly the cause of the unfortunate death of the man, who lived in the "Eva Peron" neighborhood.

Dr Hugo Gorla, Director of the Centenario Hospital, dispelled any type of doubt and indicated to the newspaper Diario El Dia that, "the patient died of [a] hantavirus [infection]." He also explained that, "he did not appear to have a dengue clinical picture; we had to follow the protocols to get the results of the tests. They were positive [for a hantavirus infection], and analysis of the case is continuing in Parana."

In conclusion, Gorla stated that this type of case falls within normal parameters "for the type of work that this man did," referring to his working in rural areas.

"Beyond that it might be a dengue case or not, in unknown febrile syndrome cases [such as this one], samples are sent to the department of epidemiology, and on the ground, barriers [are established] and prophylaxis action is taken," stated Martin Piaggio, Subsecretary of Social Development and Health, in referring to the disposition [of the case] that began last week. [Action] consisted of "going from house to house and informing the neighbors that fumigation will be carried out."

This operation was carried forward by [health] promoters of the Gualeguaychu Municipal Health Office together with personnel from the Veterinary [office] in charge of fumigation, which still continues in the critical areas of the Eva Peron neighborhood.

Hantaviruses are a genus of a group of RNA viruses which are transmitted by infected rodents (zoonoses) and, in humans, usually produce 2 types of [clinical] effects: a type of viral hemorrhagic fever or a serious pulmonary disease. These viruses belong to the Bunyaviridae family and are considered at biosafety risk level 4.

[Presumably, fumigation was carried out for mosquito control when the case was suspected of being a dengue case. Why it would be continued once the hantavirus infection diagnosis was established is not clear. Fumigation would not be an effective way to control rodents in buildings inhabited by people.

As has been mentioned in previous moderator comments concerning hantavirus infections in Argentina, cases of hantavirus infections were reported from various parts of Argentina last year (2012) and again this year (2013). In 2011, there were 4 confirmed cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Entre Rios province, 2 of whom died (see ProMED-mail archive no 20110523.1562).

The specific hantaviruses involved in these cases, including the current one above, are not specified. As noted in ProMED-mail archive no 20110430.1348, several hantaviruses have been associated with human infection and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in Argentina: Andes virus (western Argentina, in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat host, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_); related Andes-like viruses Hu39694 (in central Argentina; rodent host unknown); Lechiguana (in central Argentina in the yellow pygmy rice rat _O. flavescens_); Oran (in northwestern Argentina in _O. longicaudatus_); and Bermejo (western Argentina in _O. flavescens_).

Without laboratory confirmation, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved. Andes virus seems unlikely. This case may have been caused by Lechiguana virus infection.
