_Ixodes scapularis_is a Competent Vector of Powassan Virus
----------------------------------------------------------
A relevant reference was left out of the report on Powassan encephalitis
human cases in Maine and Vermont [see: Encephalitis, Powassan virus - USA
(Maine & Vermont) 20010907.2146. We were able to determine that under
experimental conditions _Ixodes scapularis_ ticks are competent vectors of
Powassan virus. We found that all stages (larvae, nymphs, and adults) can
become infected when feeding on a viremic host and that all infected stages
can transmit virus to naive hosts. We also found evidence of transovarial
transmission.
This paper was the first demonstration that _Ixodes scapularis_ could be an
important vector of Powassan virus and, considering the wide distribution
of this tick species and its catholic feeding preferences, that it could
contribute to an increase in the number of Powassan cases.
The reference is: Costero A. and Grayson MA. 1996. Experimental
transmission of Powassan Virus (_Flaviviridae_) by _Ixodes scapularis_
ticks (_Acari_:_Ixodidae_). Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 55(5): 536-546.
