Manitoba horse owners and veterinarians have been notified about a
potential exposure to a new strain of equine herpes virus at a horse
show in Brandon several weeks ago.

Horses from an out-of-province facility where animals have tested
positive for equine herpes virus 1 were at the show.

"Three horses at an out-of-province facility came down with clinical
signs consistent with equine herpes virus myeloencephalopathy [EHM].
Horses from that facility had travelled to a show in Brandon while
this was going on," explained Dr. Glen Duizer, Animal Health
Surveillance Veterinarian with the Chief Veterinary Office.

Another out-of-province horse that had contact with the horses that
were in Brandon is also exhibiting signs consistent with EHV1.

Duizer says they're reminding horse owners to use basic biosecurity
precautions.

"This is not a time to be sharing equipment, tack, trailers, feed
buckets or water buckets," he says. "We recognize that horse owners
want to travel to shows and go on group rides. In many cases, that's
part of the purpose of having horses. As much as it would be great to
say stay home and don't take your horse anywhere, we're not convinced
it's fully necessary in this case."

An EHM outbreak occurred in Alberta in May 2011.

"The key thing we want to say is there have been no cases of EHM
identified in Manitoba. We are monitoring it closely. ... We wanted to
make horse owners aware this was possible, but we don't want them to
panic. We just want them to be careful," says Duizer.

Dr. Wayne Lees, the province's Chief Veterinary Officer, issued the
following notice to horse owners and veterinarians:

"Subject: Equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM) exposure in
Manitoba
To: Manitoba horse owners and veterinarians

This letter is to notify you of recent EHM exposure to horses
traveling to Manitoba equine events. An out of province horse facility
is reported to have had 3 horses that exhibited clinical signs
consistent with EHM, beginning on 2 Oct 2011. Diagnostic testing on
one of the horses was positive for equine herpes virus 1 (EHV1),
although the specific strain was not identified. Two of the 3 horses
have succumbed to the disease. The owner of the facility has been
advised by their veterinarian to quarantine all horses on the facility
for a minimum of 6 weeks. While none of the affected horses were
reported to have been in Manitoba, other horses from the facility had
traveled to a horse show in Brandon during same time frame. A horse at
a separate out of province facility had direct contact with the horses
from the 1st facility that traveled to Brandon. This horse is now
exhibiting respiratory signs consistent with EHV1, although no
diagnostic confirmation has occurred.

EHV1 is a common, very contagious virus in horse populations that
causes respiratory disease, abortion outbreaks and rarely the
neurologic disease known as EHM. Over the past several years, reported
cases of EVH1, especially EHM, have been on the rise across North
America. Additionally, there have been several outbreaks of EHM linked
to horse shows and large equine facilities. A new strain of the virus,
called neurotropic equine herpes virus 1 (nEHV1) has been associated
with this emerging disease. The latest reported outbreak in western
Canada occurred in May of this year [2011]. No new cases from that
outbreak have been identified since early June 2011.

To protect their horses, Manitoba horse owners should use basic
biosecurity precautions:

* Do not share equipment, tack, feed buckets, water buckets or
trailers.

* If attending shows or events, use precautions to limit direct
contact between horses from different locations. Owners may also want
to consider isolating horses returning from shows or new introductions
from the rest of the horses at their home premises.

* When handling multiple horses, wash or disinfect hands between
horses.

* Use clean foot ware and clothing when moving between horse farms or
between groups of horses: Horse owners are advised to provide clean
foot ware and coveralls to all visitors that come in direct contact
with horses on their premises.

* Vaccinate horses against the common infectious diseases, including
EHV1. There are no vaccines for nEHV1. However, vaccinations help keep
horses healthy by preventing other infectious diseases.

* Monitor horses closely for any signs of fever, loss of appetite,
nasal discharge, depression or weakness. Owners should be particularly
concerned about the 14-day period after horses return from shows.
Contact a veterinarian immediately if a horse shows significant signs
of illness.

* Isolate sick horses from other horses and allow no direct contact.
If a horse becomes sick at a show or event, remove the horse
immediately and notify the event organizers.

* If handling sick horses, use disposable gloves, and immediately
change clothing and foot ware afterwards.

* Clean and disinfect all equipment and environment exposed to sick
horses (stalls, trailers, tack, feeding equipment, water buckets).
Disinfectants, such as bleach, are not effective unless a thorough
cleaning has occurred 1st.

Horse owners are encouraged to contact their veterinarians to discuss
the level of risk, exposure and adequate biosecurity, including
vaccination, for their own horses and facilities.

Veterinarians are encouraged to report suspect cases to the CVO.
Veterinarians are also encouraged to submit samples from any horses
that exhibit clinical signs consistent equine herpes virus infection.
Details for the correct sample type and submission requirements can be
obtained from Veterinary Diagnostic Services at 945-8220.

Overall, it is important to note that no affected horses have been
reported in Manitoba to date. The Chief Veterinary Office will work
closely with Manitoba veterinarians to monitor the situation. Horse
owners are strongly encouraged to take prudent and rational
precautions to protect their horses. If you have any questions or
concerns, please contact the CVO at 945-967663 or Dr. Glen Duizer
945-4174
