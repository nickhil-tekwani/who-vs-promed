[3] Reduced risk for mpox after receipt of 1 or 2 doses of JYNNEOS vaccine

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------
What is already known about this topic?
Real-world data on the magnitude and durability of protection by JYNNEOS vaccine against monkeypox (mpox) remain limited.

What is added by this report?
Among JYNNEOS vaccine-eligible men aged 18-49 years in 43 US jurisdictions, mpox incidence among unvaccinated persons was 9.6 times as high as that among persons who had received 2 vaccine doses and 7.4 times as high as that among persons who had received only the first dose. Preliminary evidence indicates no difference in protection between subcutaneous and intradermal administration routes.

What are the implications for public health practice?
Although further study is needed to determine the magnitude and durability of protection, evidence indicates that JYNNEOS vaccination provides protection against mpox. Vaccine-eligible persons should complete the 2-dose vaccination series.

Discussion
----------
In this evaluation of mpox among men aged 18-49 years, incidences were lower among those who were vaccinated than among unvaccinated, vaccine-eligible persons. A proportional hazards model that accounted for time-varying risk supported the finding of a larger risk reduction among persons who had received 2 vaccine doses than among those who had received only 1 dose. Compared with a previous report, this analysis expands knowledge about mpox incidence by vaccination status by including more jurisdictions during a longer observation period, resulting in the addition of the equivalent of >1 million person-weeks of follow-up. Further, increased completeness of vaccination administration date (from 43% to 82% completeness) and a better-fitting statistical model yielded more precise effect estimates. These findings are consistent with those of the previous analysis as well as recent studies reporting some protection and modest induction of antibody levels after the 1st JYNNEOS vaccine dose.

The analysis also suggested no difference in vaccine performance between subcutaneous and intradermal administration. This supports previous clinical trial data that indicated similar immune responses to JYNNEOS vaccination over time after intradermal or subcutaneous administration.

The findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations.
First, the linkage of mpox case surveillance and vaccination administration data might have resulted in misclassifications that could influence estimates. This approach assumed that persons with unknown vaccination status were unvaccinated and excluded those with unknown dates of vaccination, because the timing between vaccination and illness onset could not be established, potentially underestimating incidence among vaccinated persons.
Second, this analysis was unable to control for possible differences in testing or behaviors that affect the risk for _Monkeypox virus_ exposure (e.g., reducing the number of sexual partners), or possible differences in risk of infection because of patient characteristics (e.g., age, underlying medical conditions, and HIV-associated immune suppression); consequently, causal attribution of these results to vaccination cannot be definitively inferred from these data.
Third, the temporality of exposures that result in infection is not known, nor was it possible to determine whether vaccination was administered as postexposure or preexposure prophylaxis.
Fourth, confirmation that all identified persons with mpox were members of the population eligible for vaccination was not possible.
Finally, considering persons vaccinated as of 2 weeks before the end date of a surveillance week could overestimate the number of persons vaccinated each week and, thus, underestimate the weekly incidence among vaccinated persons.

Monitoring mpox incidence by vaccination status using currently available surveillance data provides an indication of the real-world impact of JYNNEOS vaccine on the prevention of mpox to guide rapid public health decision-making, subject to the limitations noted. Although the findings suggest a protective effect of JYNNEOS vaccination, additional epidemiologic studies that better account for potential biases will provide additional data on the magnitude and duration of protection by JYNNEOS against mpox. These findings also suggest that JYNNEOS vaccination provides protection against mpox infection, irrespective of the route of administration. Persons who are eligible for mpox vaccination should receive the complete recommended 2-dose series to optimize their protection against mpox.

[The above is fantastic news and helps reinforce that the limited animal data that was used to support the intradermal vaccinations was critical as it indicated it would likely work. It also reinforces the importance of having well-characterized animal models tested under a variety of conditions that can help inform the decision making process in cases like this where there simply was not enough vaccine to vaccinate those in high risk groups. The limited decrease in incidence seen with one dose (vs no doses) was also an important observation for future flare ups and/or outbreaks as it indicates there may be a benefit to vaccinating a broader population once vs a smaller cohort twice, especially in a resource-constrained environment. Time will tell if those single-dosed individuals also had lessened clinical symptoms. Duration of immunity will also be key including whether a 2nd dose at some later date will prove as durable as 2 doses given on schedule. - Mod.JH]

Abstract
--------
Human monkeypox [mpox], a disease with similarities to smallpox, is endemic in Africa where it has persisted as a zoonosis with limited human-to-human spread. Unexpectedly, the disease expanded globally in 2022 driven by human-to-human transmission outside of Africa. It is not yet known whether the latter is due solely to behavioral and environmental factors or whether the monkeypox virus [MPXV] is adapting to a new host. Genome sequencing has revealed differences between the current outbreak strains, classified as clade 2b, and the prior clade 2a and clade 1 viruses but whether these differences contribute to virulence or transmission has not been determined. We demonstrate that the wild-derived inbred CAST/EiJ mouse provides an exceptional animal model for investigating clade differences in monkeypox virus virulence and show that the order is clade 1 > clade 2a > clade 2b.1. The greatly reduced replication of the clade 2b.1 major outbreak strain in mice and absence of lethality at 100-times the lethal dose of a closely related clade 2a virus, despite similar multiplication in cell culture, suggest that clade 2b is evolving diminished virulence or adapting to other species.

Introduction
------------
A 2nd clade of MPXV (now referred to as clade 2a) with a 95% nucleotide sequence identity to the original was subsequently recognized. Clade 1 is associated with a mortality of up to 10% whereas clade 2a from West Africa has a mortality of less than 1%. The current outbreak strain of MPXV has been designated clade 2b because of its sequence similarity to clade 2a and like the latter has low mortality in immunocompetent individuals. Whereas clades 1 and 2a are zoonoses, clade 2b has exhibited extensive human-to-human spread. Although aerosol transmission of MPXV has been demonstrated in the laboratory, direct contact with animals and close human interactions appear more important.

The number of human monkeypox cases has been increasing in Africa, likely due to waning population immunity from the discontinued smallpox vaccine as well as changing environmental and social factors. Human monkeypox due to clade 2a has occurred in other parts of the world through importation of African rodents into the US in 2003 and by travelers from Africa but without evident human-to-human transmission. However, the unprecedented increase in clade 2b cases in 2022 is due to human transmission outside of Africa. At the time of writing, more than 80,000 cases in over 100 different locations were diagnosed.

Genetic differences contributing to the greater morbidity of clade 1 MPXV compared to clade 2a and the increased human transmission of clade 2b are unknown. Knowledge of such differences could provide an early warning of the potential virulence of new or hybrid strains, help identify therapeutic targets, and contribute to basic knowledge of virus-host interactions. Although the genomes of clade 1 and 2 viruses are highly conserved, there are numerous sequence differences that could account for the greater virulence of the former, whereas clades 2a and 2b viruses have fewer differences. Animal models are crucial for investigating virus pathogenesis, and in the case of MPXV, such studies need to be carried out under stringent BSL-3 containment conditions. Moreover, clade 1 viruses are classified as Select Agents in the US limiting the number of laboratories working on MPXV. Parker and Buller and Alakunle et al. have provided extensive descriptions of natural and experimental infections with MPXV, although the primary reservoir species is unknown. The experimental animals include Asian primates, African rodents, and a variety of North American rodents including prairie dogs and squirrels. The African dormouse (_Graphiurus kelleni_) is of particular interest since these small squirrel-like rodents can be bred in captivity and were among the African rodents that tested positive for MPXV in a shipment that introduced the virus into the US in 2003. Cotton rats (_Sigmoidin_ sp.) are another species susceptible to MPXV that can be raised in captivity. Nevertheless, African dormice and cotton rats are not inbred, and the absence of immunological reagents is a disadvantage for the study of virulence. Other small animals that can be reared in captivity such as guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, and most mouse strains do not develop severe disease upon inoculation with MPXV.

A mouse model for MPXV would have numerous advantages. To identify a susceptible mouse, we screened a panel of 38 inbred strains by intranasal (IN) inoculation of a clade 1 MPXV and discovered the exceptional vulnerability of the CAST/EiJ mouse and confirmed the resistance of common inbred mouse strains (14). Subsequent studies showed that the CAST mouse is also highly susceptible to other orthopoxviruses including vaccinia, cowpox, and Akhmeta viruses. IN inoculation of CAST mice with variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox, resulted in only mild disease with some virus shedding and limited skin lesions in accordance with the specificity of variola virus for humans.

CAST mice were derived from founder specimens trapped in a grain storage facility in Thailand (JAX® NOTES, Issue 456, Winter 1994) and because they are genetically distinct from common inbred laboratory mice were included in the Collaborative Cross panel. CAST mice are immunologically competent; they make good antibody and T-cell responses upon vaccination that provide complete protection from MPXV. Low basal levels of natural killer cells likely contribute to their susceptibility to MPXV and other orthopoxviruses, as administration of interferon gamma, IL-15, or natural killer cells expanded in vitro each provide resistance. Here, we develop the CAST mouse as a model to compare MPXV clades and show that the order of virulence is clade 1 > 2a > 2b.1.

Discussion
------------
There are numerous reports suggesting that observed genome sequence variations might account for differences in virulence and transmission of MPXV clades. However, few such predictions have been tested experimentally. Reasons for this include the need for a suitable animal model and the stringent biosafety conditions that must be met, particularly for clade 1 MPXV. Using objective criteria, we showed that clade 1, clade 2a, and clade 2b.1 MPXVs exhibit large differences in morbidity and virus replication in CAST mice. By the IP route of infection, MPXV clades 1 and 2a had LD50 values of 1 PFU and 103 PFU, respectively, whereas all mice survived even 105 PFU of the clade 2b.1 virus. The difference in virulence between clades 1 and 2a was less by the IN route but here too mice survived 105 PFU of the clade 2b.1 virus. For both routes, replication in the lungs and abdominal organs also followed the order of clade 1 > 2a > 2b.1. Although we have not yet compared clades using other routes for infection of CAST mice, we previously reported that skin scarification of the clade 1 virus causes local lesions but no other signs of disease, whereas footpad inoculation caused swelling of the lower leg and one of four mice died on day 14 with virus in the lungs, liver and spleen. Similar studies with clade 2a and 2b viruses are planned. The increase in human transmission of clade 2b and the striking reduction in virulence for CAST mice raise the possibility that MPXV is adapting to humans with a concomitant loss of fitness for certain other species.

Determination of which genes are responsible for the virulence differences of MPXV clades remains to be determined. MPXV like other members of the orthopoxvirus genus encodes about 100 accessory genes that are largely dispensable for replication in vitro but affect host range and virulence. Interestingly, recent gene loss has been a major factor in the evolution of orthopoxviruses that can account for differences in their host range (23). For example, cowpox virus with the most accessory genes has a wide host range, whereas variola virus with the fewest is specific for humans. Of interest, human transmitted variola virus (17) and MPXV clade 2b.1 cause only mild disease in CAST mice. We have started to investigate the genetic determinants responsible for virulence differences of clade 1 and 2a viruses and plan to extend this to clade 2b. It has been suggested that orthopoxvirus immune modulators might reduce an overreaction of the host immune response and loss of such genes might increase virulence (24). Thus, both gain and loss of gene function should be considered in assessing virulence.

[A similar study on attenuation of the virus via genome deletion was published nearly 7 years ago (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682214005030?via%3Dihub). This reinforces just how choppy the mpox space has been from a research perspective as the field is years of small projects that all continued to move the field forward despite the lack of the large programmatic efforts that it typically takes to understand the pathogenesis of the virus and produce viable vaccines and therapeutics. - Mod.JH]

The Ministry of Health confirmed detecting a new positive case of monkeypox [mpox] infection in the country for a patient, aged 39 years.

In a statement on Thursday [8 Dec 2022], the ministry said discovering and isolating the new case come as part of the ministry's efforts to monitor and handle any suspicious cases of infectious diseases.

Precautionary measures have been taken to ensure that the patient and his relatives and other individuals who have had close contact with the case prior to confirmation of its infection do not contact any persons in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization in this regard, according to the statement.

[As noted in item [1] above, this is only the 3rd case of mpox reported in Egypt.

There's been ongoing dialogue surrounding the actual age of the monkeypox virus and whether it may have caused outbreaks far earlier than realized and may have been mistaken as smallpox. This has led to calls to test mummified animals for mpox to verify if ancient Egyptians may have been infected with mpox (https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(22)00219-1/fulltext). This would be a fantastic application of One Health with respect to verifying the true age of a virus by looking for it in species besides humans in which it could have been circulating. - Mod.JH]
