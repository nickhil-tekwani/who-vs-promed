Survey near UC-Lindcove to determine tristeza spread
----------------------------------------------------
In the heart of the San Joaquin Valley citrus belt is the University
of California, Lindcove Research and Extention Center. It is home of
the Citrus Clonal Protection Program, which supplies disease-free
budwood for the industry. Time and money spent to bring a citrus
grove into production are wasted if the trees are infected with a disease.

A total of 50 trees infected with the _Citrus tristeza virus_ were
identified and removed at the center last year [2007]. Of those, 4
were in the foundation block where budwood for the industry is cut.
The rest of the infected trees were in research blocks. Lindcove
Director Beth Grafton-Cardwell deemed the infection level high enough
to restrict release of budwood, which limits citrus nurseries'
ability to propagate trees. The Tulare County Pest Control District
board voted unanimously to begin a tree survey project to determine
the extent of _Citrus tristeza virus_ within 3 miles of Lindcove.

To protect California's citrus industry all citrus budwood entering
the state must be quarantined and tested to see if it is virus-free.
Testing was halted in 1998 when the district board voted to opt out
of the eradication program. Grafton-Cardwell said a survey conducted
in 1998 found an infection rate of 0.14 percent. A survey last year
[2007] on trees within half a mile of Lindcove found an infection
rate of 1.2 percent.

Research blocks at Lindcove near adjacent commercial groves were
hardest hit by the virus. Grafton-Cardwell said the board is not
committed to tree removal, but the survey would let them know the
cost of removal if it is deemed necessary. She said they might need
several million dollars in funding over several years for eradication.

Consequences of ignoring the problem could be harsh. Grafton-Cardwell
said the Lindcove screenhouse that protects trees from insects [that
spread CTV] cannot produce enough budwood for the industry and does
not include all the varieties. Loss of budwood from the foundation
block of citrus would impact nurseries' ability to propagate trees
for growers, especially some of the sought-after varieties like the
Tango mandarin. She also noted trees lost from research blocks
compromise ongoing studies in pest management, water use and other
citrus management practices. The Central California Tristeza
Eradication Agency said the survey would begin in March [2008] with
the flush of new growth. Results should be known by June.

[Of all the citrus diseases, more than 30 are caused by viruses and
virus-like organisms. Of these, _Citrus tristeza virus_ (CTV; genus
_Closterovirus_) is considered to be one of the most destructive,
killing millions of trees every year worldwide. It causes severe leaf
and bark symptoms such as yellowing and stem-pitting, as well as
die-back and stunting on a number of citrus species. CTV is spread by
several aphid species (including, for example, the brown citrus
aphid) and risk of spread is particularly high when aphids feed on
new flush growth in the spring. The virus can also be transmitted by
grafting and mechanical means and appears to be spreading wherever
citrus is grown. Different strains of CTV may vary in symptom
severity. Introduction of more severe strains, for example the
'orange stem pitting' strain, is a constant risk even in CTV-affected
areas. Strains inducing mild symptoms in some citrus varieties may
lead to serious problems when transmitted to other varieties. CTV has
been included in the quarantine list of the European Plant Protection
Organisation (EPPO). Disease management includes clean planting stock
and budwood, elimination of inoculum, and vector control.

It appears that a short sighted decision 10 years ago has led to the
present problem (see previous ProMED-Mail post no. 20070528.1710). As
a result of ignoring scientific advice at the time, much more
expensive measures are now necessary to ameliorate the effect of CTV
on the industry than would have been needed to maintain the CTV-free
status of the trees used for providing budwood.
