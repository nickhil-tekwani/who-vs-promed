Hepatitis E virus infections can be fatal in pregnant women but until
recently doctors thought the disease was confined to China, India, and
developing countries. Now Europeans are also contracting the disease here,
say scientists today [Mon 3 Sep 2007] at the Society for General
Microbiology's 161st meeting at the University of Edinburgh, UK.
Hepatitis E virus is one of the few viruses which has been shown to be
transmitted directly from animals through food. It was recently thought to
be confined to developing countries, and although scientists are still
unsure exactly how it spreads to people, direct contact with pigs or eating
contaminated pork products is a likely route.
"If this proves to be a relevant route for pig to human infection for
hepatitis E in Europe, food safety regulations might need to be adapted
accordingly," says Dutch researcher Erwin Duizer. "Where we do find
hepatitis E virus identified in Europe, then the strain is usually closely
related to the viruses found in pigs in the same country."
Far fewer cases of hepatitis E virus are reported than actually occur,
since doctors currently rarely ask for the relevant diagnostic tests in
many industrialized countries. Although they do not yet know the exact
route for most infections, the scientists do know that these viruses can
infect people if they eat infected pig's livers without cooking them.
Genetic material from hepatitis E viruses has already been detected in pig
livers being offered for sale in Japan, USA and the Netherlands, proving
that European pigs are in contact with hepatitis E. Wild boar products
could present a similar risk.
"To improve understanding of this disease, doctors should routinely start
asking for hepatitis E screening tests, even if the patient has not been
travelling in India, China or other countries where they might expect to be
at risk of infection," says Erwin Duizer. "Once more people are correctly
diagnosed with viral hepatitis E, they can be treated more effectively, and
we can learn more on the transmission routes. Current rates of diagnosis
are up to 13 per cent of acute viral hepatitis patients in European
countries, but we think the true rate is much higher. Up to 3 per cent of
blood donors in Europe show evidence of exposure to the virus through
detectable antibodies. We also need to quickly work out the local route of
infection in Europeans, as [in] knowing if hepatitis E is directly caused
by eating pork meat or liver or caused by foods or people being in contact
with pig faeces, [which] will make it possible to implement effective
preventive measures," says Erwin Duizer.

[Some time ago, Dr Robert McNair Scott <scottrmcn@cs.net> wrote to
ProMED-mail asking a question, which this Moderator failed to answer for
want of appropriate information. His comments have some relevance to the
above report, and I reproduce them below on account of their general interest.
Dr McNair Scott wrote: "I have noted over the past several years large
outbreaks of reportedly HAV [hepatitis A virus] being reported from central
Asia and other developing nations with dubious able sanitary infrastructure.
"In my experience in Nepal, the vast majority of people, 95 per cent plus,
have had hepatitis A by the time they reach 5 years. I believe that the
situation in countries like Nepal are the same. In most, if not all, of
these reports, the diagnosis is given without any laboratory findings to
back it up. Are these seat of the pants diagnoses? Again, in my experience,
large outbreaks of viral hepatitis in developing countries, are usually
hepatitis E.
"This becomes important, as the HEV vaccine that we tested in Nepal proved
to be very effective in preventing clinical hepatitis, but the world
problem with this disease continues to be underestimated because of lack of
diagnostic tools and seat of the pants diagnoses. Even in countries like
Britain, whose sanitary infrastructure should be good, there are those who
are now saying that HEV is the most common cause of viral hepatitis in that
country. My question is: "Could some/all of these HAV outbreaks be in
reality HEV?"
Dr McNair Scott's remarks have some relevance to the preceding post. - Mod.CP]
