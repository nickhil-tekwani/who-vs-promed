The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) has reported that a horse previously stabled at Parx Racing, in Bensalem, Pennsylvania, tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1, also known as equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy or EHM).

The EDCC's 2 Apr 2016 statement said the horse "with clinical signs of EHM" was being treated in isolation at a New Jersey equine veterinary hospital before testing positive for the neuropathogenic strain of EHV-1. The affected horse was subsequently euthanized. [This horse will later be named No Quid Pro Quo - Mod.TG]

The EDCC statement said, "2 barns at Parx with exposed horses are currently under quarantine. Updates will be posted as they become available."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, fever is the only sign of EHV-1 infection, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around eight months), but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore- and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

A 2nd horse has tested positive for equine herpesvirus at Parx Racing, which will extend the current quarantine into at least early May [2016].

The 3-year-old filly Monkey Hill was tested for the virus after becoming sick, and on Monday afternoon [4 Apr 2016] it was confirmed she had tested positive. Monkey Hill is trained by Michael Aro, the trainer of No Quid Pro Quo, who last Friday [1 Apr 2016] was determined to have the herpesvirus. No Quid Pro Quo was sent to the Mid-Atlantic Equine Center in Ringoes, [New Jersey], the middle of last week [week of 28 Apr 2016] after becoming ill, and has since died.

Sam Elliott, the director of racing at Parx, said Monkey Hill's temperature had subsided by Tuesday morning [5 Apr 2016] and that he was in the process of attempting to locate an off-track farm where Monkey Hill could be isolated.

The equine herpesvirus can cause respiratory and neurological problems in horses. It is a contagious disease that can sometimes be fatal.

Two barns on the Parx backstretch, Barn 30 and Barn 4, have been quarantined and the horses in them are not being allowed to train or race. Aro and trainer Ron Dandy are housed in Barn 30, and trainers Butch Reid and Keith Nations are stabled in Barn 4.

Barn 4 is quarantined because Reid claimed Sunshine Wild from Dandy for USD 40 000 on [29 Mar 2016], the day before No Quid Pro Quo became ill. According to Elliott, Sunshine Wild became ill several days ago but has tested negative for the equine herpesvirus.

Horses stabled at Parx are not allowed to leave the grounds and, although racing is scheduled to continue at the Bensalem, Pennsylvania, track, entries are no longer being accepted for horses stabled elsewhere. Elliott explained that if horses were to ship in to run they would have to stay at Parx until the quarantine was over and that he does not have the stalls needed to accommodate them. [It is mentioned above that horses are not allowed to leave, presumably this means to another track and not to a treatment facility. - Mod.TG]

The quarantine will stay in place until 28 days pass without a horse testing positive for the equine herpesvirus. The [?Fri 1 Apr/?4 Apr/?5 Apr 2016?] test report on Monkey Hill restarted the 28-day period, which will now extend until 2 May 2016 [?4 May 2016].

On [Mon 4 Apr 2016], Parx ran 11 races, but many had short fields due to scratches. Monday's races were drawn before No Quid Pro Quo became ill. The track has a 9-race card Tuesday.

This is the 2nd equine herpes quarantine at Parx in the last 6 months. The track was quarantined for practically all of October 2015 after a single horse tested positive for the virus after shipping in from Presque Isle Downs.

Two tracks in the Southwest, Sunland Park and Turf Paradise, were quarantined over the winter [2015-2016] due to the equine herpesvirus. Sunland Park was forced to suspend racing from [23 Jan to 26 Feb 2016] after a reported 68 horses became ill.

A 3rd horse tested positive for the equine herpesvirus at Parx Racing on [Wed 6 Apr 2016]. The soonest a quarantine at the track can now be lifted is [4 May 2016].

All 3 horses to test positive are from Barn 30, where trainers Michael Aro and Ron Dandy are stabled. Salute to Bob, a 3-year-old trained by Dandy who had been racing in the lower maiden-claiming ranks, tested positive for the virus [Wed 6 Apr 2016] after becoming ill.

The 1st 2 horses to test positive were trained by Aro. No Quid Pro Quo tested positive [1 Apr 2016] and has died. The 2nd horse, Monkey Hill, tested positive [5 Apr 2016]. She has been moved off track to a farm, where she is being kept in isolation.

Barn 4 also is under quarantine because Butch Reid, who is stabled there, claimed Sunshine Wild from Dandy on [29 Mar 2016], the day before No Quid Pro Quo became ill.

The quarantine will remain in effect until 28 days pass without a horse testing positive for the virus. During the quarantine, horses are not allowed to ship in or out of Parx.

Racing at Parx is scheduled to continue during the quarantine, although horses from barns 4 and 30 are not allowed to train or race and are being isolated from the rest of the track's horse population.

The equine herpesvirus can cause respiratory and neurological problems in horses. It is a contagious disease that can sometimes be fatal.

This is the 2nd equine herpesvirus quarantine at Parx in the last 6 months. The track was quarantined for practically all of October [2015] after a single horse tested positive after shipping in from Presque Isle Downs.

[The 3 articles are slightly difficult to follow as there are different dates given for illness being noted, positive test results, and the length of quarantine. There is some discrepancy in the dates for the confirmation of results from Monkey Hill (given as 4, 5, and 6 Apr 2016] and the date of end of quarantine (given as 2 and 4 May 2016).

This disease can spread quickly. There is no recommendation in this article for other horse owner/agents to be taking the temperature of their horse at least twice a day. A slight rise in body temperature is the earliest sign of problems.

Equine herpesviruses (EHV) are in the [sub]family _Alphaherpesvirinae_ of the _Herpesviridae_ and are enveloped double stranded DNA viruses. There are 5 alpha herpesviruses that infect horses (EHV-1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). For the purposes of this fact sheet, we will focus on EHV-1 and EHV-4, which are the 2 that result in serious clinical disease in the horse. EHV-1 and EHV-4 used to be considered subtypes of the same virus, but are now recognized as closely related but different viruses. EHV-1 is commonly found in horse populations worldwide and was previously referred to as the equine abortion virus. Although EHV-1 is well known for causing reproductive disease, it is also known to cause respiratory and neurological disease. EHV-4 is also known as equine rhinopneumonitis virus and is most common among foals and yearlings. Although EHV-4 most commonly causes respiratory disease, it can also cause abortion and neurological disease.

"The incubation period (period of time from exposure to development of 1st clinical signs) ranges from 2 to 10 days. Respiratory signs for EHV-1 and EHV-4 include fever of 102-107 deg F [38-41 deg C] that lasts for 1-7 days, coughing, depression, inappetence (going off feed), and nasal discharge. Abortion usually occurs between months 7 and 11 of gestation, about 2-12 weeks after infection. There is no evidence that the mare's reproductive tract is damaged, and it does not affect her ability to conceive in later pregnancies. Signs of neurological disease for EHV-1 and EHV-4 include mild incoordination, hind limb paralysis, recumbency (lying down and being unable to get up), loss of bladder and tail function, and loss of sensation to the skin around the tail and hind limb areas.

"Transmission occurs when infected and uninfected horses come in either direct (nose to nose contact) or indirect (through buckets, clothing, blankets that are contaminated) contact with nasal discharges of infected horses. The virus can travel via aerosol (in the air) for short distances. The virus may also be transmitted by contact with aborted fetuses, placental fluids, or placentas from infected horses. Also, following infection, horses may become latent carriers of EHV; virus may be reactivated after stress or high doses of corticosteroids.

"Upon detection of clinical signs suggestive of EHV, the veterinarian may choose to take a nasopharyngeal (nose and throat) swab of the horse, blood sample, or tissue from the aborted fetus for detection of virus in the tissues. Paired blood samples for detection of antibody titers (levels) may also be taken. Treatment involves supportive care and treatment of the symptoms. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used to reduce fever, pain, and inflammation. In uncomplicated cases, complete recovery will occur in a few weeks. Horses with neurological disease have variable recovery rates depending on severity of the clinical signs. The prognosis is poor if the horse is recumbent (unable to stand) for an extended period of time. The horse should be rested until fully recovered and gradually returned to work.

"There are 2 types of vaccines available for use in the horse for prevention of the disease, but their use remains controversial. Vaccination may reduce the severity and duration of disease, but will not totally prevent the disease. Your equine veterinarian should be consulted regarding the most appropriate use of vaccination in your particular circumstance. Since latent infection is still a problem, vaccination must go hand-in-hand with the use of best management practices.

"There are both modified live virus and killed virus vaccines available. The modified live virus vaccine contains virus that has been altered to make it unlikely to cause disease but is still able to reproduce in the body cells and stimulate immunity. The killed vaccine contains virus that has been inactivated or killed using either heat or chemicals. The modified live vaccine is administered intranasally and offers quicker protection. There is no scientific basis to indicate that the modified live vaccine will cause disease. The killed vaccine is given intramuscularly. Vaccine usage in light of the recent outbreaks of neurological EHV-1 is currently being re-evaluated. Consult your veterinarian for recommendations.

"In order to prevent an outbreak, horses arriving on a farm from other locations should be isolated for 3-4 weeks before being introduced into the resident horse population. Reduce management-related stressors that may increase the possibility of stress-induced reactivation of latent EHV-1 in carrier horses. Keep horses separated by physiological state or group, especially with regards to pregnant mares, who should be kept away from weanlings, yearlings, and performance horses that frequently travel.

"In the case of an outbreak, infected horses should be isolated from other horses. The stable should be quarantined for at least 3 weeks after signs of clinical disease in the last case subside. All stable equipment should be disinfected. People handling the infected horses should be sure to wash their hands after handling each horse, dip their shoes in a disinfecting foot bath, and change clothes before working with healthy horses. Some sources suggest that bedding be removed and burned. Barn stalls, aisles, and other surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected as well. Although this virus can last for several weeks in the environment, it is readily killed by most common disinfectants; phenol based disinfectants are commonly used.

"Equine herpesvirus infection can become a serious problem. Being aware of the types of equine herpesvirus, clinical signs associated with the disease, transmission, diagnosis, treatment and, especially, ways to protect your horses from infection, will aid you if there is an outbreak in your area. Incorporating measures to protect your horse now may prevent problems in the future.
