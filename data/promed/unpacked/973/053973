The EPIZONE symposium titled "Bluetongue in Europe, back to the
future!!" was held in Brescia, Italy on 7 Jun 2008. In the abstract
book there are 4 studies dealing with the transplacental transmission
of BTV. These are:

1. Oral presentation: Fraser Menzies et al: Transplacental and
contact transmission of bluetongue virus from an outbreak in a cattle
herd in Northern Ireland. p. 36.

The abstract includes the statement: "...circumstantial evidence is
presented to indicate contact spread of the bluetongue virus with
oral transmission by ingestion of infected placenta being the most
probable route of infection".

2. Oral presentation: Anoek Backx et al: Evidence for transplacental
and oral transmission of wild type bluetongue virus serotype 8 after
experimental infection in cattle: are unusual routes of virus
transmission involved in overwintering? p. 48.

The abstract includes the statement: "Transplacental and oral
transmission of BTV are rare, and will be of minor or no importance
during periods of vector activity. However, incidental successful
transmission of BTV via these routes could lengthen the presence of
viraemic animals during the winter period without vector activity,
and consequently could be of major importance for the overwintering of BTV."

3. Poster presentation: Peter Mertens et al: Movement of bluetongue
virus strains during the disease outbreak caused by BTV-8 in northern
Europe during 2006-2008 as revealed by sequence analysis of genome
segment 2." p. 65.

The poster includes the statement: "During January 2008 (in the
vector-free season) 8 BTV-seropositive but PCR (polymerase chain
reaction) negative animals were imported into Northern Ireland (which
was BTV free) from the Netherlands. Although these animals were also
PCR-negative for BTV at 12 and 42 days post-importation, 3 of their
calves were shown to be infected with BTV-8 soon after they were born
(by real time Rt-PCR and virus isolation) indicating vertical
transmission. The infection was also passed to 2 previously
seronegative and PCR negative animals (one from the Netherlands and
one from Scotland) that had been housed in the same building,
indicating horizontal transmission, in the absence of the adult
vector insects."

4. Poster presentation: Linda van Wuijkhuise-Sjouke et al: Vertical
transmission of wild type bluetongue virus serotype 8 after natural
infection in cattle: are unusual routes of virus transmission
involved in overwintering? p. 77.

The poster includes the following statement: "The majority of calves
from infected cows were negative... 13 calves were seropositive, most
likely by uptake of colostrum from infected cows... Apparently, the
northern European variant of BTV-8 can spread vertically resulting in
viraemic calves in spring. This phenomenon could lengthen the
presence of viraemic animals during the winter period without vector
activity, and consequently could be of major importance for the
overwintering of BTV."

[We are very grateful to Rudy Meiswinkel for his kind assistance by
forwarding the excerpts above from the abstract book of the
Bluetongue Satellite symposium, held in Brescia, Italy, on 7 Jun
2008. The symposium was organized by the EU funded Network of
Excellence EPIZONE.

Subscribers are referred also to the 30 Apr 2008 presentation
"Overwintering of BTV-8 in the UK & Northern Europe" by Karin Darpel,
Chris Oura, and Philip Mellor from the Arbovirology Department, IAH,
Pirbright, available at
<http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/controlmeasures/bluetongue_en.print.htm>.

The authors state:
"1. Three calves, born in NI (Northern Ireland) during the "vector
free period" (VFP) to seropositive but PCR negative dams imported
from Holland, were transplacentally infected. Infectious virus was
isolated from one of these calves.
2. Two adult bovines imported into NI (from Holland and Scotland)
were infected in NI during the VFP.
3. The mechanism by which the adult bovines were infected is
uncertain but as they had access to virus-contaminated placentas and
the infected calves, it is probable that the route of infection was oral.
4. These 2 routes of transmission have not been previously documented
for field viruses. They require further investigation."

The placental transmissibility of the European BTV-8 virus is indeed
highly unusual for a field virus; its further studies are anticipated
with great interest. - Mod.AS]
