The Veraguas provincial Ministry of Health [MINSA] is investigating 2 suspected cases of hantavirus [infection], both from the Sona district, specifically from the Calidonia community.

German Solis, Regional MIBSA Director in Veraguas, said that the epidemiologist Ricardo Chong sent samples to the Gorgas Memorial Center in the capital city, where results are awaited.

Solis said that probably 1 of the suspected cases had been infected with hantavirus in previous years and presumably that the disease has appeared again.

He indicated that 1 of the suspected cases was a 28-year-old man, who presented with symptoms very peculiar for people with hantavirus [infection], so they proceeded to undertake preventive measures; he is hospitalized until he [no longer poses a risk of infection].

The Veraguas Ministry of Health as adopted preventive measures in the Calidonia community in Sona, where the people suspected of hantavirus infection were.

Hantavirus [pulmonary syndrome] is a serious, acute viral disease. Field mice (mainly long-tailed) transmit the [virus] to people, shedding the virus in saliva, feces and urine.

How is it transmitted [to people]:
- By inhalation -- the most frequent cause. This occurs when we breathe in closed or open places (sheds, vegetable gardens, pastures) where the infected rodent's feces or urine spread the virus, contaminating the environment.
- By direct contact: through touching live or dead infected rodents, or the feces or urine of these rodents.
- By bites: through bites by infected rodents.

[Veraguas province adjoins both Los Santos and Herrera provinces, where all the reported cases of hantavirus infections have occurred so far in 2015. Cases in Veraguas province are not surprising. There have been several HPS cases in the Azuero region, which includes Los Santos and Herrera provinces, both of which have had HPS cases this year (2015). This region is endemic for Choclo hantavirus. No data on the previous cases include an indication of which hantavirus is responsible. Choclo is the only 1 of the 3 hantaviruses known to be endemic in Panama that causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. ProMED would appreciate receiving the results of the laboratory tests when they become available confirming or ruling out a hantavirus infection. Also, no evidence is given to support the statement that 1 of the cases had a previous hantavirus infection, nor is there a description of the unusual symptoms mentioned.

The preventive measures indicated in the above report include elimination of sites attractive to rodents. The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
These rodents occur in and around agricultural areas and adjacent houses and buildings.
