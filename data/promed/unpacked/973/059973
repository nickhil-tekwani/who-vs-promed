The number of salmonella cases linked to a church barbecue fund raising event earlier in September 2013 has climbed to 54, the Cleveland County Health Department says. Health officials say 10 of those sickened were hospitalized, but only one remained in the hospital as of Thursday evening [19 Sep 2013].

The salmonella cases are linked to a 7 Sep 2013 event at Sandy Plains Baptist Church near Shelby. 1st reports of the sickness came early this week, and the number of cases has increased steadily since then. Officials say 29 cases are Cleveland County residents, with the others from Rutherford County. 11 cases are confirmed and the other 43 suspected.

Anyone who brought home food purchased at the event should discard it, authorities say.

If you attended the event and have suffered salmonella symptoms -- vomiting and diarrhea -- you are asked to contact the Cleveland County Health Department, 704-484-5100; or the Rutherford County Health Department, 828-287-6100.

It is 13 days after the event. Most likely, the rapid rise in cases now represents reporting of cases of salmonellosis that began several days after the event. However, if the food vehicle here was bought and not eaten for a time, some cases could be presenting later. Unlike _E. coli_ O157 and _Shigella_, the risk of person-to-person spread of salmonellosis is quite low. - Mod.LL
