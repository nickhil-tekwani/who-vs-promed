The trial [a South African patient] joined was small -- it enrolled only 109 patients -- but experts are calling the preliminary results groundbreaking. The drug regimen tested on [her] has shown a 90% success rate against a deadly plague, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis.

On Wednesday [14 Aug 2019], the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) effectively endorsed the approach, approving the newest of the 3 drugs used in the regimen. Usually, the World Health Organization adopts approvals made by the FDA or its European counterpart, meaning the treatment could soon come into use worldwide.

Tuberculosis has now surpassed AIDS as the world's leading infectious cause of death, and the so-called XDR [extensively drug resistant] strain is the ultimate in lethality. It is resistant to all 4 families of antibiotics typically used to fight the disease. Only a tiny fraction of the 10 million people infected by TB each year get this type, but very few of them survive it. There are about 30 000 cases in over 100 countries. Three-quarters of those patients die before they even receive a diagnosis, experts believe, and among those who get typical treatment, the cure rate is only 34%. The treatment itself is extraordinarily difficult. A typical regimen in South Africa requires up to 40 daily pills, taken for up to 2 years.

Other countries rely on even older regimens that include daily injections of antibiotics that can have devastating side effects, including deafness, kidney failure and psychosis.

But in the trial [the South African patient] joined, nicknamed Nix-TB, patients took only 5 pills a day for 6 months. The pills contain just 3 drugs: pretomanid, bedaquiline and linezolid. (Someday, the whole regimen might come in just one pill, as HIV drugs do, one expert said.)

Until recently, some advocacy groups opposed pretomanid's approval, saying the drug needed further testing. But other TB experts argued that the situation is so desperate that risks had to be taken. Dr. Gerald Friedland, one of the discoverers of XDR-TB and now an emeritus professor at Yale's medical school, called Nix "a wonderful trial" that could revolutionize treatment: "If this works as well as it seems to, we need to do this now."

News that tuberculosis had evolved a terrifying new strain 1st broke in 2006, when doctors at a global AIDS conference learned of a doomed group of tuberculosis patients in Tugela Ferry, a rural South African town. Of the 53 patients in whom the strain had been detected, 52 were dead -- most within a month of diagnosis. They were relatively young: The median age was 35. Many of them had never been treated for TB before, meaning they had caught the drug-resistant strain from others who had been infected and had not developed it by failing to take their drugs. Several were health workers who were assumed to have caught it from patients.

Within months, South Africa realized it had cases of the deadly infection in 40 hospitals. Alarmed, WHO officials called for worldwide testing. The results showed that 28 countries, including the USA, had the deadly strain, XDR-TB, and that two-thirds of the cases were in China, India and Russia. It took far longer to determine how widespread it was in Africa, because most countries there could not do the sophisticated testing.

HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, helped drive the epidemic. Anyone infected with it is 25 times as likely to get TB, according to the WHO But many victims [ ...] catch this type of TB without ever having HIV.

In the early years, XDR-TB was a death sentence. Doctors tried every drug they could think of, from those used to treat leprosy to those for urinary tract infections. "From 2007 to 2014, we threw the kitchen sink at it," said Dr. Francesca Conradie, a researcher at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, and director of the Nix trial. The death rate was about 80%. Sometimes the drugs killed patients. In other cases, patients died of the disease, because they could not tolerate the drugs and stopped taking them.

Tuberculosis germs burrow deep into the lungs and barricade themselves inside clumps of dead cells. Breaking those nodules apart and killing all the bacteria inside requires taking drugs for months.

Nearly all antibiotics cause nausea and diarrhea. But some, especially the injections, are far tougher on patients. "Some get hallucinations," said Dr. Pauline Howell, a tuberculosis researcher who runs the Nix trial at Sizwe Tropical Diseases Hospital in Johannesburg, where [the South African patient] was treated. "I had one patient who tried to cut open his skin because he thought bugs were crawling under it." The drugs may leave patients in wheelchairs with vertigo, or deaf in just a weekend. Nerves in their feet and hands may wither until they can no longer walk or cook. One of Dr. Howell's patients suffered so much from ringing in the ears that he tried to commit suicide.

Although it lies in South Africa's largest city, Sizwe does host monkeys, along with feral peacocks and the occasional mongoose. It has long been on the front lines of South Africa's protracted battle against tuberculosis. The hospital sits on an isolated hilltop 10 miles from downtown. The British built it in 1895 as Rietfontein Hospital to house victims of contagious diseases like leprosy, smallpox and syphilis. Gandhi volunteered there during a 1904 bubonic plague outbreak, and Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a tuberculosis patient there in his youth.

In 1996, with the AIDS epidemic raging, the WHO announced that South Africa had the world's worst tuberculosis epidemic: 350 cases per 100 000 citizens. That finding shocked the government, which had been using outdated approaches against the disease. Diagnoses were made by X-ray, which are less accurate than sputum tests, and doctors hospitalized every patient. I visited shortly after the 1996 announcement, and the situation inside Rietfontein was unnerving. In the men's ward, dozens of TB patients lay on cots only 2 feet apart; those with drug-resistant strains slept next to patients with the usual type. No one wore a mask, and no doctor was on duty. At night, the patients shut them and turned up the heat, and the room became a deadly incubator.

A return visit this month [August 2019] showed that far more than the name had changed (Sizwe means "nation" in Zulu). Pool and table tennis are among the activities provided to TB patients at Sizwe. Treatment can require years in confinement. The former men's ward is now a mostly empty meeting hall. Patients with TB that is not drug-resistant are treated at home, and even those with partially drug-resistant strains are usually hospitalized only briefly. The XDR-TB patients rest in a ward atop the hill, and golf carts transport those too weak to walk. Each patient has a separate room and bathroom, hookups for oxygen and lung suction, a TV and big windows and a door to the lawn outside. The building has a sophisticated ventilation system, but it often breaks down, so the policy is to keep all the doors and windows open as much as possible, said Dr. Rianna Louw, the hospital's chief executive. Patients can work in the garden, play pool or foosball, and take classes in sewing, beading or other crafts that might help them earn a living when they get out. But the months of isolation needed for treatment can be tough.

The regimen successfully tested at Sizwe is called BPaL, shorthand for the 3 drugs it comprises: bedaquiline, pretomanid and linezolid. The BPaL regimen is "bold, because it's 3 killer drugs instead of 2 killers plus some supportive ones," Dr. Howell said. Most regimens, she explained, rely on 2 harsh drugs that can destroy bacterial walls and include others that have fewer side effects but only stop TB bacteria from multiplying.

But even the new treatment poses hazards. Short-term use of linezolid against severe hospital infections causes few problems, but use for many weeks against TB can kill nerves in the feet, making it hard to walk, or can suppress the bone marrow where blood cells are made. (To find the ideal linezolid dose, the Nix investigators have started a new trial, ZeNix.)

The FDA approved bedaquiline in 2012 for use against multi-drug resistant TB (the XDR strain is an even deadlier subset), and in 2015 the WHO followed suit. Until Wednesday [14 Aug 2019], pretomanid was in dispute, although in June [2019] an FDA advisory committee voted 14 to 4 to approve it.

Some advocacy groups argued at the time that the drug had been too little tested. "Pretomanid looks like a promising drug, but it's being rushed forward, and we don't want to see the FDA lower the bar for approval," Lindsay McKenna, co-director of the tuberculosis project at the Treatment Action Group, an advocacy organization, said in July [2019]. Her organization and others had asked the FDA to 1st demand more rigorous testing of the drug.

Pretomanid is not owned by a drug company but by the TB Alliance, a nonprofit based in New York that is seeking new treatments. Dr. Mel Spigelman, the alliance's president, had argued that a full clinical trial would be both impractical and unethical. "Put yourself in a patient's position," he said. "Offered a choice between 3 drugs with a 90% cure rate, and 20 or more with less chance of cure -- who would consent to randomization?" Such a trial would cost USD 30 million and take 5 more years, he added: "That's a very poor use of scarce resources."

[The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a new drug, pretomanid, on 14 Aug 2019 for the treatment of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), the most drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), when used in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-resistant-forms-tuberculosis-affects-lungs).

XDR-TB is a type of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). MDR-TB is resistant to both isoniazid and rifampin; XDR-TB is resistant not only to isoniazid and rifampin but also to any fluoroquinolone and at least one of 3 injectable 2nd-line drugs (amikacin, kanamycin, or capreomycin).

In 2016, there were an estimated 490 000 new cases of MDR-TB worldwide and XDR-TB has been reported everywhere where there is lab capacity to identify it (https://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/drug-resistant-tb/xdr-tb-faq/en/). By the end of 2016, XDR-TB has been reported by 123 WHO Member States, and information from countries with reliable data suggests that about 6.2% of MDR-TB cases have XDR-TB (https://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/drug-resistant-tb/xdr-tb-faq/en/).

Treatment for XDR-TB traditionally involves use of multiple 2-line drugs in combination, some given orally, others intramuscularly, taken typically for 2 years. Cure rates have been low, and associated with significant drug toxicities. Cure depends on the extent of the drug resistance, the severity of the disease, the presence of immune insufficiency, as well as the availability of 2nd-line drugs and clinicians who have special expertise in treating such cases, and access to laboratories that can provide early, accurate diagnosis so that effective treatment is provided as soon as possible (https://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/drug-resistant-tb/xdr-tb-faq/en/).

The pretomanid study regimen (pretomanid combined with bedaquiline and linezolid), in contrast, is administered orally, is reportedly well tolerated, and has a treatment duration of 6 months. Its cure rate was 89%: 95 of the 107 patients who were evaluated 6 months after the end of therapy had successful treatment, far exceeding success rates of available treatments. The most common adverse reactions peripheral neuropathy (likely a consequence of linezolid neurotoxicity), acne, anemia, nausea, vomiting, headache, increased liver enzymes (transaminases and gamma-glutamyltransferase), indigestion (dyspepsia), rash, increased pancreatic enzymes (hyperamylasemia), visual impairment (also likely a consequence of linezolid neurotoxicity), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), and diarrhea (https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-new-drug-treatment-resistant-forms-tuberculosis-affects-lungs).

Pretomanid and bedaquiline are among the very few new drugs approved by the US FDA for treating TB in the past 40 years. Pretomanid is a member of a class of compounds known as nitroimidazooxazines. It has a narrow spectrum of bactericidal activity limited primarily to the _M. tuberculosis_ complex, and has no cross-resistance to a variety of antituberculosis drugs. After activation within the bacterial cell, pretomanid kills actively replicating _M. tuberculosis_ by inhibiting mycolic acid biosynthesis, thereby blocking cell wall synthesis; against non-replicating bacteria, pretomanid acts as a respiratory poison by release of nitric oxide (https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2019/212862s000lbl.pdf). A shorter duration of therapy is thought to be possible because of pretomanid's bactericidal activity against both replicating and non-replicating _M. tuberculosis_ organisms, in contrast to current anti-TB drugs.

Bedaquiline, a diarylquinoline, has a unique bactericidal mechanism of action that targets adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, an energy-generating enzyme of _M. tuberculosis_ (https://www.cdc.gov/tb/publications/factsheets/treatment/Multidrug-Resistant_Tuberculosis_Bedaquiline.pdf). Following the FDA approval of bedaquiline for the treatment of drug-resistant TB in 2012, the CDC issued guidelines on the use of the drug for the treatment of multidrug resistant TB in 2013 (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6209a1.htm).

Linezolid is an oxazolidinone with bactericidal activity against drug-resistant strains of _M. tuberculosis_ and has been used regimens in combination with other anti-TB drugs (e.g., a fluoroquinolone and aminoglycoside). Linezolid's use is limited by the dose-and duration-dependent occurrence of reversible myelosuppression and peripheral and optic neuropathy (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4740312/). - Mod.ML]
