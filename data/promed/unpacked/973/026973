[The following communication provides information on the outbreak in Nayarit additional to that of the OIE report posted on 29 Mar 2019. - Mod.TY]

The Servicio Nacional de Sanidad, Inocuidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria (National Service for Agrifood Health, Safety and Quality, SENASICA) scientists investigate the virus that is [causing equine encephalitis] present just in Nayarit [state] in order to be able to count on information necessary to combat it.

The experts of the National Producer of Veterinary Biologics (PRONAVE) are currently working on the development of a Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) vaccine as an alternative to control.

Mexico City 28 Mar 2019: SENASICA has reinforced their measures to contain the WEEV detected in Nayarit and in order to report their findings to the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE).

The veterinarians of the Secretariat of Agriculture and Rural Development (SADER) continue epidemiological tracking in Nayarit in search of horses with signs of neurological alterations caused by WEEV, a disease that is found exclusively in 5 municipalities in this state: Ixtlan del Rio, Compostela, Ahuacatlan, Bahia de Banderas and Tepic.

As an additional measure, SENASICA delivered a virus from their bank of pathogens to PRONAVE in order to initiate tests that would permit development of an effective vaccine as an alternative to control the disease.

The SENASICA scientists have done 141 investigations [in the affected areas] and to date have detected 41 equine animals positive for western equine encephalitis and discarded other diseases that could be confounding, such as rabies, Venezuelan equine encephalitis and West Nile virus, among others of those that have effective vaccines in Mexico.

They have located 17 rural properties with affected animals, in which there had been a population of 141 equine animals; 25 were ill, of which 18 died. In the study area, they found animals that apparently were healthy although positive for the virus.

The SENASICA medical entomologists put up different types of traps that would permit constant [continuous] identification of the vector _Culex tarsalis_, the principal transmitter of the disease [virus].

Due to this, SENASICA activated a national level alert with the objective that equine animal owners report any neuropathology that they detect in their horses to [numbers and extensions] or by mail [address] to SADER personnel in all states in the Republic.

SENASICA exhorted the owners of these types of animals to report if they note nervous symptoms in the horses. The details of the principal symptoms highlight incoordination of movements, fever and blindness. The disease is not necessarily fatal; some individuals manage to recuperate.

Also, it is recommended to bathe horses in repellant with the objective of reducing the risk that they be bitten by insects, and repeat the quarantine imposed by Nayarit state, which impedes the leaving and entry of equine animals to the area.

The SADER ornithologists carry out studies of the birds that are around the places with detected viral activity to collect blood serum samples for serological studies and identify those that are reservoirs in order to advance epidemiological understanding.

With the samples from the field, the technicians in the SENASICA level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory in Palo Alto, Mexico City, work to isolate WEEV in cell cultures and suckling mice that would permit them to count on complete information about the pathogen. The scientists in the laboratory work to develop specific techniques for virus diagnosis.

Similarly, in the BSL-2 laboratory in El Salto in Jalisco, of this National Service, diverse tests are implemented, such as nested RT-PCR and real-time RT-PCR, with the objective of improving the opportunity for an early diagnosis.

Western equine encephalitis is an infectious disease caused by a virus that is transmitted from birds to equine animals via the bite of a mosquito.

[WEE equine cases are seldom reported in Mexico. The above report illustrates the capability of the animal health authorities in Mexico to respond quickly to an outbreak in horses and quickly come up with a diagnosis. Their interdisciplinary team included veterinarians, ornithologists, medical/veterinary entomologists with field personnel linked to laboratory technical experts (with appropriate facilities and equipment) in order to get a more complete picture of the epidemiological characteristics of this outbreak and quickly arrive at a diagnosis. One hopes that surveillance will continue to detect any new cases and respond in a timely manner.

Roberto Navarro Lopez is thanked for sending this report to ProMED-mail. - Mod.TY
