Fatal flu hits northern Manitoba native reserve
-----------------------------------------------
Native leaders in northern Manitoba fear they may be in grip of a
lethal influenza outbreak. One person died last week [21-27 Nov 2010]
on a northern reserve in which Influenza A was a factor, according to
Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer.
Tests are being conducted on other cases, he said. The virus H1N1 is
one of a number of influenza viruses within that strain. "We are very
interested and concerned about the situation, and are watching it
very closely," Dr. Kettner said Thursday evening [2 Dec 2010].

David Harper, grand chief of the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak,
which represents most northern Manitoba 1st nations, said there have
been 2 recent deaths and a 3rd person is very ill. He fears influenza
may be a factor in all 3 cases, and in the illnesses of others. Both
victims were members of Garden Hill 1st nation, according to David
McDougall, chief of nearby St. Theresa Point. "We heard about it and
our community is now on alert for extreme cases of flu," he said,
though he added so far the community had been spared.

The victims were in their 30s and 40s and were healthy before
becoming infected with the disease, Mr. Harper said. But sanitation
conditions on the northern reserves are far from optimal, and
underlying health problems, in some cases exacerbated by alcohol and
poor nutrition, can complicate diagnosis, Dr. Kettner said.

The 1st victim, a woman, died a week ago Thursday [25 Nov 2010], Mr.
Harper said. The 2nd victim, a man, died Thursday [2 Dec 2010]. The
3rd, a woman, is at a Winnipeg hospital, he said. Mr. Harper
estimated about 20 of 4200 people in the Garden Hill community were
currently ill. "We are very concerned," he said. "We need way more
attention." Dr. Kettner said federal and provincial health officials
are on the scene providing flu shots and monitoring cases.

During the last H1N1 season in 2009, young Manitoban aboriginals
appeared to be particularly vulnerable to the disease. Two-thirds of
all flu victims on respirators in the province were aboriginal. Their
average age was just 35. Conflicting research results have left
confusion over the vulnerability of aboriginal Canadians to the H1N1
[2009 pandemic influenza] virus. One study earlier this year found
that 60 percent of Manitoba's severe [pandemic] H1N1 cases for 2009
affected 1st nations people. But a University of Manitoba study this
month concluded that they were equally able to ward off the disease.

[Enhanced vulnerability of 1st nation inhabitants of Canada to
infection by the pandemic 2009 A/(H1N1) strain of influenza virus has
been a matter of contention which remains to be resolved. This
concern has resurfaced following the occurrence of 2 deaths and one
severe illness in recent days which have been attributed to A/(H1N1)
2009 virus infection. Further information is awaited.
