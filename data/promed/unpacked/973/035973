A sudden loss of disease resistance in chickpea crops in South Australia is raising concerns. South Australian Research and Development Institute (SARDI) Dr Jenny Davidson said she was concerned about the level of infection in varieties thought to be resistant to the disease.

Ascochyta blight has been detected in several cropping regions. Dr Davidson said not only was the extent of the disease concerning, but so too the pace of the outbreak had been unexpected.

"Suddenly this year [2016], we assume to do with the rain in winter, the disease is creating some really severe problems. This sudden loss of resistance is a bit surprising, the speed with which it has happened. We've got a dramatic shift in the whole spectrum of what's going on."

Scientists are urging farmers to get on top of the outbreak as soon as possible to help reduce its severity and spray their fungicides ahead of rain fronts. "They really need to be very diligent about those sprays," Dr Davidson said.

[Ascochyta blight (AB) of chickpea is caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella rabiei_ (previously _Ascochyta rabiei_) and is considered the most important disease of chickpeas worldwide. The pathogen attacks all aerial portions of the plant and is specific to chickpeas. Disease development is favoured by cool, wet conditions. Symptoms may include spots and lesions on leaves, stems, and pods which may lead to partial wilting, or the whole shoot may break off and the plant will die. Infected seeds are shriveled, spotted, and discoloured.

The pathogen can survive on infected plant material for at least 2 years under dry conditions, but viability is lost rapidly in high humidity. It is seed borne at a high rate of 50-80 per cent. Seed transmission is the primary mode of spread both locally and worldwide. Disease management includes cultural methods, seed treatment, prophylactic fungicide applications, and use of varieties with improved resistance.

In Australia, outbreaks of AB are currently also being reported from Queensland and Victoria (see links below). A pathogen strain which had broken host resistance in currently used cultivars was recorded in Victoria in 2015 (ProMED-mail post 20150925.3669437). The emergence of multiple AB variants with increased virulence is considered a threat by the national chickpea industry.

Ascochyta blight (AB) of lentils is caused by the fungus _Didymella lentis_ (previously _Ascochyta lentis_). The 2 pathogens are now classified into different genera, but the same common name derived from their previous classification is still used for both diseases.
