The Dutch Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority (NVWA) has found for the 1st time, the bacterium _Brucella canis_ in dogs born in the Netherlands. The bacterium causes the brucellosis disease. In theory, this disease can also spread to people, although the chance is very small.

All veterinarians in the Netherlands have received a newsletter in which the NVWA alerts the professional group about the emergence of this disease of dogs. The most important signs of the disease are serious back- and neck pains. In addition, the bacterium may cause infertility, dead or weak neonates, and difficulties in urination and defecation.

The human disease may be expressed by long-term fever. Often, there are complaints such as headache, fatigue, listlessness, sweating and joint problems. Brucellosis can be treated with antibiotics, but if this is not done in a timely way, a chronic disease can develop. However, the risk of human disease in the Netherlands is very small, says the the NVWA: "To date, there have been no reports of infection in people in the Netherlands, not even in people who had intensive contact with infected dogs."

The NVWA discovered the dogs' disease when a veterinarian recently examined a dog imported from Russia with serious back pain. After a blood test, the animal was found to be infected with _Brucella canis_. The dog was owned by a Dutch breeder with multiple breeds. The NVWA has examined all dogs present at the breeding farm. Dogs of different breeds and genera were found to be infected. That also applied to some offspring of these dogs. All infected dogs were euthanized after consulting experts and NVWA and in consultation with the keeper.

The NVWA does not want to disclose the name of the breeding and the breeds of the dogs. In the letter to the vets, the NVWA says that "with everything in its power" it tries to track down the dog owners who have bought a puppy from the relevant breeder. The agency wants to inform the owners about the infection and discourage them from breeding the animals. The disease is not deadly, says the NVWA. But: "It is a condition that seriously affects the well-being of dogs when developing back problems. Because there is no curative therapy, it often means that the dog is then euthanized."

_B. canis_ was also found in the Netherlands in 2017 [This may refer to imported cases? - Mod.AS]. Brucellosis normally occurs mainly in South, Central and North America, in Asia and Africa.

[_Brucella canis_ is a Gram-negative coccobacillus in the family Brucellaceae (class Alphaproteobacteria). Other Brucella species occasionally associated with disease in dogs include _B. abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_.

_B. canis_ is an important cause of reproductive failure in dogs, especially in kennels. Infections can result in abortions and stillbirths in bitches, and epididymitis, prostatitis, orchitis and sperm abnormalities in males. Although spayed or neutered dogs do not have reproductive signs, they occasionally develop other conditions such as ocular disease and discospondylitis. _B. canis_ may persist in an animal even after antibiotic treatment. In kennels, infected dogs are often euthanized to prevent them from infecting other dogs or people. Canine brucellosis is sometimes difficult to diagnose with the currently available tests.

The importance of _B. canis_ as a cause of human illness is still unclear. Few clinical cases have been reported in people, and most have been mild. However, human infections with this organism may be underdiagnosed, as the symptoms are nonspecific, diagnostic suspicion among physicians is low, and obtaining a definitive diagnosis may be difficult. One clinical case was caused by the M-strain of _B. canis_, a laboratory strain that has reduced virulence and is used as an antigen for serological testing.

Dogs are thought to be the only significant hosts for _B. canis_ among domesticated animals. Antibodies to this organism have been detected in cats in South America, but bacteria were not recovered. Antibodies to _B canis_ have also been reported occasionally in wild canids.

_B. canis_ appears to be widely distributed. It has been reported in North, Central and South America, parts of Asia, Africa and Europe. New Zealand and Australia appear to be free of _B. canis_; however, Australia has reported some _B. suis_ infections in dogs, mainly in animals used to hunt feral pigs.

The above, and additional exhaustive information, is available in the 2018 fact sheet 'Brucellosis: Canine' by Anna Rovid Spickler, at http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/brucellosis_canis.pdf.

In reference to the last sentence in the above media report, mentioning earlier _B. canis_ cases in the Netherlands, we found in the Dutch veterinary journal TvDK of 6 Feb 2019 the following information: "Since 2016, several dogs originating in east Europe have been found infected by _B. canis_. This bacterium has never before been recorded in the Nertherlands". (In Dutch, at https://www.knmvd.nl/tijdschriften/jaargang-144-aflevering-1-januari-2019/). - Mod.AS
