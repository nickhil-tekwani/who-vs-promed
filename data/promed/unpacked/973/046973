This is headed in a tedious direction. The first report of simian viruses
transmissible to man that I am aware of was when Albert Sabin reported
herpes B in an animal handler in 1932. Since then there have been a
plethora of viruses in vaccines not only SV40, but spumaviruses, and
ephemeral suspicions of SIV, contaminated yellow fever vaccines, and others
that are likely to infect humans.
The problem is that it is evidently impossible to look at early lots of
vaccines made from crude primary cultures of monkey entrails because they
have been "lost" or are otherwise unavailable from drug companies, the FDA
and institutions. While there have been some half hearted attempts to
exonerate vaccines by either inappropriate antibody studies or with poorly
designed experiments on inappropriate vaccine stocks, no real unbiased
studies (in my opinion) have been published. Instead there has, and
continues to be the constant circling of liability lawyers, denials by
those involved in earlier simian vaccines, and the politically correct
approach of denying anything ever
happened so that people will not be fearful about immunizing children with
vaccines that should have been made by recombinant technology years ago.
The recent outburst about SV40 (and presumably other polyoma viruses) has
turned into an acrimonious debate between individuals with sinle [sic:
single? techniques and a lack of clinical material. I suggest the
moderators not waste time on vaccine debates and return to further
speculation about xenotransplants and the putative epi- and pandemics
resulting therefrom.

[Your conclusion does not seem to follow from your argument. Vaccines are
full of simian viruses, yet no harm has ever been demonstrated to come from
them, supposedly because no good studies have been made. Yet we can be
quite sure that if an epidemic had resulted, we would have heard about it.
So on that basis, why should we worry about harm coming from simian viruses
in xenotransplants? - Mod.JW

Should some thought be given to the differences between healthy lab workers
who have an immune system capable of dealing with a simian virus, and a
transplant candidate that is probably going to be debilitated to some
degree, will most likely be immune suppressed to prevent tissue rejection
and will have the virus placed internally, bypassing the initial defense
mechanisms of the immune system?

[Similarly, vaccines are generally given to healthy people. The concerns
about simian virus spread in transplant recipients who are immunosuppressed
are valid. However, let us be clear that the effect would stop with the
patient, and not spread to family members (unless they were also
immunosuppressed, and the patient was shedding virus). And there is the
inevitable trade-off; would a person who will die without a transplant, and
is too far down the list for a human organ, be willing to accept an animal
organ against the risk that they might end up with a probably asymptomatic
infection with an animal virus? - Mod.JW

Primate papovaviruses, e.g. SV40, are widely used to induce human cell
transformation in vitro, and even if their inocuousness has been fully
exemplified in the past on the basis of clinical and serological surveys,
there is at least one example of an SV-40-transformed cell line isolated
from the milk of an apparently healthy woman: i.e. HBL-100 (ATCC number
HTB-124 and Caron de Fromentel et al., Exp. Cell Res., 160, 83-94, 1985).
The questions are:
What is the ultimate assay to assess the complete inocuousness of animal
viruses accidentally infecting humans?
How long should the epidemiological survey be pursued?
