A potentially deadly mosquito, which has already spread to the mainland of the Greece and other Mediterranean countries, is now present also in the island of Crete. Under the frame of the European project LIFE CONOPS (LIFE12 ENV/GR/000466) an entomological surveillance in the island of Crete (Greece) was conducted in 2015 by the Benaki Phytopathological Institute (BPI), in cooperation with the Regional Unit of Crete - Directorates of Public Health & Social Care of Regional Units. The surveillance resulted in the 1st record of the _Aedes albopictus_ (Asian tiger mosquito) in Crete.

The LIFE CONOPS is warning the residents to be wary of mosquitoes that bite during the day. That's not normal behavior for most mosquitoes, but this species is special and it can transmit viruses such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Females usually do not fly more than 200 meters [700 ft] away from their breeding sites to find hosts. Therefore, the thorough inspection for potential breeding sites and their elimination (e.g. through drainage) or appropriate management (e.g. coverage of the breeding sites) in houses or in surrounding areas contribute to the control of _Ae. albopictus_.

Moreover, the standard measures of personal protection can be used against mosquito bites, such as insect repellents for skin and clothes or insecticides for indoor or outdoor use (e.g. vaporizing mats, liquid vaporizers and mosquito coils).

This mosquito is a competent laboratory vector for at least 22 arboviruses as well as nematodes of the genus _Dirofilaria_. Among the invasive mosquito species recorded in Europe, _Ae. albopictus_ is probably the most serious threat to public health and is already causing outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya [fevers] in the Mediterranean region.

The presence of the Asian tiger mosquito was confirmed for the 1st time in northwestern Greece, from mosquito specimens collected during mosquito samplings in Thesprotia and Corfu during 2003 and 2004. Since then the Asian tiger mosquito has been also found in other parts of the country, such as Central Macedonia, the Peloponnese and Attica.

LIFE CONOPS (entitled: Development & demonstration of management plans against -- the climate change enhanced -- invasive mosquitoes in S. Europe) is funded by the European Commission in the framework of the programme LIFE + Environment Policy and Governance. LIFE CONOPS project aims at the development of integrated management plans for the effective and environmental friendly control of the invasive mosquito species spread and establishment across Europe.

[Finding _Ae. albopictus_ in Crete is not surprising. This mosquito has been spreading around the Mediterranean Basin for some time, including into mainland Greece. Eradication is probably not possible, but control measures, especially elimination of breeding sites, can reduce their populations. ProMED-mail thanks Dr. Michaelakis for sending in this report.
