A gene that makes bugs highly resistant to almost all known
antibiotics has been found in bacteria in water supplies in New Delhi
used by local people for drinking, washing, and cooking, scientists
said. The NDM 1 gene, which creates what some experts describe as
"super superbugs," has spread to germs that cause cholera and
dysentery, and is circulating freely in other bacteria in the Indian
city capital of 14 million people, the researchers said.

"The inhabitants of New Delhi are continually being exposed to
multidrug-resistant and NDM 1-positive bacteria," said Mark Toleman of
Britain's Cardiff University School of Medicine, who published the
findings in a study on Thursday, 7 Apr 2011.

A "substantial number" of them are consuming such bacteria on a daily
basis, he told a briefing in London. "We believe we have discovered a
very significant underlying source of NDM 1 in the capital city of
India," he said.

NDM 1, or New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1, makes bacteria
resistant to almost all antibiotics, including the most powerful
class, called carbapenems.

It first emerged in India 3 years ago and has now spread across the
world. It has been found in a wide variety of bugs, including familiar
pathogens like _E. coli_.

No new drugs are on the horizon for at least 5-6 years to tackle it
and experts are concerned that only a few major drug companies, such
as GlaxoSmithKline and AstraZeneca, still have strong antibiotic
development programs.

Experts say the spread of superbugs threatens whole swathes of modern
medicine, which cannot be practiced if doctors have no effective
antibiotics to ward off infections during surgery, intensive care, or
cancer treatments like chemotherapy.

The WHO has designated April 7 as World Health Day and under the
slogan "No action today, no cure tomorrow" it is campaigning about the
risks of life-saving antibiotics losing their healing power. "We are
at a critical point in time where antibiotic resistance is reaching
unprecedented levels," said Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO's regional
director for Europe.

"Given the growth of travel and trade in Europe and across the world,
people should be aware that until all countries tackle this, no
country alone can be safe."

The plasmid carrying NDM-1 also carries several other resistance genes
and appears to easily transmit itself to other organisms. The authors
state "the dissemination of this plasmid among clinical bacteria would
be a nightmare scenario." Clearly, inadequate sanitary systems make
spread of enteric bacteria of any sort quite easy.

This gene cassette of wide-spectrum antimicrobial resistance appears
to have developed in the Indian subcontinent where the use of
antimicrobial agents is quite poorly controlled. Organisms carrying
this resistance combination have already been introduced into western
Europe, the USA, and Canada. The best methods of control are rapid
recognition by standard microbiologic methodology in patients having
the appropriate medical/travel history and aggressive handwashing
techniques.

The amazing overuse of our current antimicrobial armamentarium that I
am currently observing in my clinical practice in the USA will no
doubt serve as an efficient multiplier of these isolates just as
intravenous drug abuse and sexual promiscuity facilitated the
explosion of HIV 30 years ago. This misuse, in my opinion, is directly
related to the lack of control of antimicrobial usage in intensive
care units and emergency care settings by intensivists and ER
physicians who often react with unwisdom and "cookbook" protocols
instead of using common sense and rational prescribing patterns. Once
the patient moves out of the ICU or ER, these physicians do not even
see the products of their unwise labors.

In the USA, reimbursements for medical care are based on procedures,
not thought processes. Until the power of therapeutic nihilism is
recognized, that is, using these agents only when rational, in
combinations that make sense, and in settings where therapeutic
interventions can have the ability to produce measurable and
meaningful improvement in a patient's life, the medical community will
continue down the slippery slope into an era where no therapeutic
options will exist. - Mod.LL]
