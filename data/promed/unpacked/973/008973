Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph)

July 8, 1997: the Scottish firm that helped engineer the first
cloned sheep, Dolly, are close to generating human plasma from animals.
They are planning to replace the plasma genes of sheep and cows with the
human equivalent. The animal's milk will then contain the key elements of
human blood plasma, including albumen, clotting factors and antibodies.
It plans to rear herds of the animals and manufacture plasma from the
proteins extracted from their milk. They hope the process will be ready "in
months." Only 5 per cent of Britain's population regularly gives blood, and
genetically modified animals
could produce 100,000 times more plasma per year than a human donor.
A spokeswoman from Britain's National Blood Service was more cautious,
saying, "Using animal-grown human plasma is fine in theory, but until the
clinical trials are complete you can never be sure that you have the full
plasma equivalent, or whether the animals will pass on diseases to man."
