FOOD, RAW, CULINARY FAD (02): REQUEST FOR INFO

Ahi Tuna is a Sushi/Sashimi dish in local [USA] Japanese Sushi bars. I
have been eating this seared ahi tuna for 3-4 years at various times. I
have seen it served at a Ritz Carlton Hotel in Laguna Niguel for a Orange
County Wine Tasting Meeting [California]. Mostly it is served as a gourmet
food. I have not seen it served as an indication of the freshness and safe
handling representation of a restaurant.
True, Anasikiasis and such [infections are] possible from raw fish, but
what are the real incidences of these parasitic diseases ? There is a lot
of raw or undercooked meat and fish served in Japanese (and other)
restaurants, but primarily Sushi Bars, throughout the United States, they
are very popular here on the West Coast! Seems there are large numbers
consuming such food.
But what percent are likely to be infected? Are there any real numbers
available? [Would any of our readers in Japan care to comment? It is not a
fad there, but part of daily eating - Mod.JW]
