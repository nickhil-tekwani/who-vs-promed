This situation involving _Alternaria_ brown spot disease of
Minneola tangelo is more complex than the posting implies. A
recent taxonomic revision of some of the _Alternaria_ pathogens
on citrus by E.G. Simmons (Mycotaxon 70: 263-323, 1999)
identifies several new species within the group previously identified
as _Alternaria alternata_ pv. _citri_ or _A. citri_. In fact none of
the 135 _Alternaria_ pathogens of citrus from Israel, Turkey,
Florida (United States), Colombia, and South Africa examined in
this study belong in the species _A. alternata_ or _A. citri_ by
morphotaxonomic standards. About 40% of the isolates examined
were unique or unstable and not assigned to a species.
Here is a brief summary of the study:
1. Brown spot of tangelo in Florida and Colombia is caused mainly
by _A. tangelonis_ sp. nov.
2. Brown spot of tangelo in Israel, Turkey and South Africa is
predominantly caused by _A. turkisafria_ sp. nov.
3. Less common newly described species of _Alternaria_ on
tangelo and tangerines and their presently known host and
geographical ranges are:
_A. citriarbusti_ sp.nov., from tangelo in Florida, USA
_A. toxicogenica_ sp. nov., from tangerine in Florida, USA
_A. colombiana_ sp. nov., from tangelo in Colombia
_A. perangusta_ sp. nov., from tangelo in Turkey
_A. interrupta_ sp. nov., from tangelo in Israel
_A. dumosa_ sp. nov., from tangelo in Israel
4. This same publication also identifies the most common
pathogen causing _Alternaria_ leaf spot of rough lemon in Florida
as _A. limoniasperae_ sp.nov., along with a less common pathogen
_A. citrimacularis_ sp. nov.
This new taxonomy of _Alternaria_ pathogens of citrus certainly
complicates international phytosanitary regulations, especially
considering that many of the _Alternaria_ spp. from citrus in the
Simmons study are unique, and others from elsewhere around the
world have yet to be critically examined.

[Many thanks to Dr. Schubert for apprising me and subscribers to
ProMED-Plant of the new taxonomy of _Alternaria_ pathogens.
His comment about the new reality regarding complications around
international phytosanitary regulations implies that considerable
work lies ahead. Feedback from ProMED-Plant subscribers is
always welcome! - Mod.DH]
