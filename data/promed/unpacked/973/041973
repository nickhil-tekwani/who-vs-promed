An outbreak of illness at a splash park near Wichita was not caused by animals at its interactive zoo, health officials said. The Wichita Eagle reported that email exchanges it obtained through an open records request indicate none of the water samples health officials took from the splash park at Tanganyika Wildlife Park had animal-linked contamination.

The newspaper reviewed more than a month of email correspondence between state and county health officials and park director Matt Fouts with details about the results of water samples taken [19 Jun 2021] and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Christine Steward, deputy health director with the Sedgwick County Health Department, sent Fouts an email on 8 Jul 2021 saying that the organisms isolated from water samples "help us rule out the animals at the park".

Health officials have said that 8 people who visited the park on 11 Jun 2021 contracted shigella, a bacteria that spreads from person to person through exposure to contaminated feces. People who visited the splash park also have tested positive for the norovirus, sapovirus, and a type of _Escherichia coli_ called enteropathogenic E. coli.

The splash park was allowed to reopen on [27 Jul 2021] after it made necessary changes and passed inspection.

[Shigella was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. Shigella organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10 to 100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

ProMED awaits further additional information regarding this small outbreak and any information regarding the specific modality of transmission of the organism here. With a splash park feature, transmission via water is certainly likely. Despite the presence of wildlife, the organism is not really considered zoonotic. Other organisms identified during the evaluation also point to a human feces-contaminated source.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux) is an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing the diarrhea). - Mod.LL
