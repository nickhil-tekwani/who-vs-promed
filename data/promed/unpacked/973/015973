Syphilis seems like a bygone disease, but it's coming back, particularly in Sacramento [California]. New cases of the vicious sexually transmitted disease have been rising steadily for several years, locally and nationally. But Sacramento County has seen an even more pronounced spike since last summer [2011].

Local doctors diagnosed 41 cases of primary and secondary syphilis (the early, less damaging phase of the disease) in the 1st half of 2011. In the 2nd half, they identified 65 cases, an increase of 60 per cent. That's according to preliminary numbers from the California Department of Public Health, where officials expect Sacramento's totals to rise by at least 10 cases once the tallies are finalized in May [2012].

Taken together, the 106 new cases in 2011 were twice as many as Sacramento saw the year before, and the county's highest annual total in at least a decade. They constitute the latest chapter in a return of the disease to the county, where only 4 syphilis cases were reported during 2001. Sacramento's primary and secondary syphilis infection rate of 7.4 cases per 100 000 residents is now 25 per cent higher than the statewide average.

"It's off the hook," said Emily Tsuchida, director of nursing at the CARES Clinic in midtown Sacramento. "Prior to June [2011], we would get maybe 4, 5, 6 cases a month, and since June we're getting at least 12." While the disease still predominantly affects gay men, as it has for years, Tsuchida said, "Now we're even coming up with it in straight women, which is really unusual."

Statewide, instances of the disease also rose last year [2011], but not as quickly, going from 2068 in 2010 to 2276 in 2011. The state did not see a spike in the 2nd half of the year, as Sacramento County did. Nationally, the infection rate more than doubled in the decade ending in 2010, up from 2.1 to 4.5 cases per 100 000 residents.

Syphilis is caused by a bacterium [_Treponema pallidum_]. The bug can pass from person to person during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. If untreated, it can resurge years or decades after the initial infection and cause paralysis, blindness and -- famously -- dementia.

Sacramento County communicable disease investigator Vanessa S, who interviews every resident diagnosed with syphilis, suspects a surprising culprit for the recent rise: smartphones. (She asked that her last name be withheld because she communicates with patients via mail and doesn't want other household members guessing the purpose of her letters.) Social networks and smartphones have made it easier for people seeking casual sex to find willing partners, Vanessa S said. Some GPS-powered apps enable people to broadcast their location to others seeking "hookups" in their vicinity.

"It's been going on for a while, but I think a lot of people are having more access to computers, and the creation of the smartphone definitely has made an impact on quick access to partners," she said. She has noticed her interviewees increasingly mentioning this in the past year as a way they've found sexual partners. Most are gay males, but some heterosexual men and women report using digital networks, too.

Some of the increase also likely comes from the fact that clinicians are growing more aware of the problem and conducting more syphilis tests, she said. County and state officials have been notifying doctors to be on the lookout. "A lot of people are still completely unaware of the incidence of syphilis that we have in the county," said Vanessa S. When she interviews patients, they often say, "Oh my God, I thought syphilis was eradicated."

In its primary and secondary phases, which occur over weeks or months, syphilis typically causes a single sore wherever the bacterium entered the body and a rash on the hands and feet, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The symptoms are often mild and painless, and the sore may be hidden inside the genitals, anus, or mouth, so many patients don't realize they're infected. Those early symptoms resolve on their own. Then the germ remains in the body, inactive and invisible, for as long as 10 or 20 years. The infection can ultimately rebound and attack internal organs, including the brain.

Syphilis is easily detected with a blood test and cured with antibiotics, though the damage done may not be reversible. The disease is contagious only in its earliest stage, via skin-to-skin contact with the sore. Condoms can prevent its spread if they cover the site of the sore.

"Syphilis historically has been seen in the older demographics, 30 and up, where we are seeing it now in the younger 20s, maybe late teens, and that is a concern for us," Tsuchida said. Part of the problem appears to be widespread ignorance of the dangers of oral sex, which can transmit STDs including syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, HPV, herpes and, in rare cases, HIV. Nearly 100 per cent of her interviewees say they do not use condoms for oral sex, even if they use them regularly for intercourse. Younger people, especially, "are using oral sex a lot more than intercourse, because they (mistakenly) think their risk is going to be minimized that way," she said.

As part of her prevention work, Vanessa S tries to identify and contact the sexual partners of each patient with syphilis, to get them testing and treatment. But it's not possible in every case. Given that, she said, "I would not be surprised if we continue to see an increase in cases."

[Cases of syphilis reported annually in the United States declined dramatically in the 1940s to a low in 2000. As the incidence rate of primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis decreased among homosexual and bisexual males, largely because of changes in sexual behavior due to AIDS, a spike occurred in the late 1980s among heterosexual men, women, and neonates (congenital syphilis) that was attributed to epidemic of crack cocaine use and exchange of sex for drugs. Cases of syphilis again dropped from 1990 to 2000. In 2000, the rate of P&S syphilis in the United States was 2.1 cases per 100 000 population, the lowest since reporting began in 1941.

However, from 2001 to 2009, the P&S syphilis incidence rate rose steadily in the United States to 4.6 cases per 100 000 population in 2009 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis2009/Syphilis-2009-All-Profiles.pdf), and remained about the same in 2010 at 4.5 cases per 100 000 population (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis2010/Syphilis-2010-All-Profiles.pdf).

CDC reported that California, with an incidence rate of 5.6 cases per 100 000 population in 2010, ranked 11 among 52 areas (49 states; Washington, DC; and 2 territories) reporting at least one case of P&S syphilis (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis2010/Syphilis-2010-All-Profiles.pdf). In California, the rate among males was 10.8 per 100 000 population compared with the US male rate of 7.9 per 100 000, and the rate among females was 0.4 per 100 000 compared with the US female rate of 1.1 per 100 000. The rate in California among blacks was more than twice that of whites and the rate among Hispanics was slightly lower than that of whites (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis2010/Syphilis-2010-All-Profiles.pdf).

In 2010, Sacramento County ranked 10 out of 58 counties, with an incidence below that of the state as a whole, while San Francisco ranked first with a incidence that was about 8 times that of the state as a whole (http://www.cdph.ca.gov/data/statistics/Documents/STD-Data-LHJ-StateSummary.pdf). Other counties with incidences in 2010 above that of the state as a whole were Los Angeles, San Diego, and Alameda Counties. An incidence of 7.6 in 2011 should now bring Sacramento into that top category.

The recent increases in incidence of P&S syphilis have been attributed in part to increases in cases among men who have sex with men (MSM) (http://www.cdc.gov/msmhealth/STD-syphilis-graph.htm), suggested by the increasing M:F rate ratio (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm), as a consequence in part of "HIV prevention fatigue", which appears to limit effective condom use, and use of "club" drugs, such as methamphetamines, gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), ecstasy, and ketamine, which can also lead to unsafe sex with multiple partners (http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/Clubdrugs.html). Syphilis increases have occurred among MSM who have met sex partners on the internet. An outbreak of early syphilis among MSM who met their sex partners on the internet in 1999 presaged a rapidly expanding syphilis epidemic in San Francisco (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5510a1.htm); by 2002, San Francisco had the highest rates of P&S syphilis of any metropolitan area in the United States (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5250a4.htm).

However, other than mentioning the use of social networking and smartphones to meet sex partners among some cases, the news report above does not fully characterize the Sacramento outbreak as to, for example, sex, race or minority group, sexual orientation, sexual behaviors, other risk behaviors, such as the use of drugs during sexual activity, and HIV co-infection. A detailed epidemiologic investigation is required so that preventive measures can be targeted to specific high-risk groups and activities.

Sacramento County, with a population of 1 418 788 in 2010, is a county in the US state of California (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_County,_California). Its county seat is the city of Sacramento, which is also the state capital.
