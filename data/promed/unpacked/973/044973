Dangerous Bird Flu Strain Found in Russia
-----------------------------------------
Investigators have determined that a strain of bird flu virus infecting
fowl in Russia is the type that can infect humans, the Agriculture Ministry
said Friday [29 Jul 2005].
The virus caused the deaths of hundreds of birds in a section of Siberia
this month, but no human infections have been reported.
In a brief statement, the ministry identified the virus as avian flu type A
H5 N1.
"That raises the need for undertaking quarantine measures of the widest
scope," the statement said. Ministry officials could not immediately be
reached for elaboration.
Strains of bird flu have been hitting flocks throughout Asia and some fatal
human cases have been reported there.

[According to the current AP media item, the agent is Influenza virus type
A, serotype H5N1. This contradicts earlier media-derived information (see
20050723.2127), according to which the agent was H5N2. An early official
notification on the determined neuraminidase (N) type is urgently required.

Avian influenza in Russia
------------------------
Immediate notification report
Translation of information received on 24 July 2005 from Dr Evgueny A.
Nepoklonov, Head of the Main Veterinary Department, Ministry of Agriculture
and Food, Moscow:
Report date: 24 July 2005 (see also Disease Information, 18 [29], 212,
dated 22 Jul 2005).
Precise identification of agent: influenza virus type A. The haemagglutinin
subtype has been preliminarily identified (from pathological material) as
H5. After confirmation by virus isolation a separate notification will be
sent. Tests are being performed to determine the neuraminidase type.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 23 Jul 2005.
Date of start of the event: 18 Jul 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, post-mortem and laboratory.
Details of outbreak:
First administrative division: Novosibirsk region (Novosibirskaya oblast)
Lower administrative division: Kupino
Type of epidemiological unit: village
Name of the location: ...
Date of start of the outbreak: 18 Jul 2005

Description of affected populations: chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese in
backyard holdings in 9 villages.
Diagnosis:
Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Federal Centre for Animal Health (ARRIAH)
Diagnostic tests used / Date / Results
- ELISA(1) (for antigen detection)/ 23 Jul 2005 / positive
- PCR(2) (M-protein gene) / .../ [no result yet - Mod. PC]
- haemagglutination test / ... / [no result yet - Mod. PC]
Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: an epidemiological analysis has
shown that the disease started in a flock in contact with wild waterfowl at
open water reservoirs. This is proposed as the primary source of the virus.
In addition, there are reports of the disease in wild birds.
Control measures undertaken:
- stamping out;
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- zoning;
- disinfection of infected premises/establishments.
Vaccination prohibited: yes.
Other details/comments:
- Considering the low mortality rate (1-2.6 percent, depending on the
locality), the virus titres are very high in some samples of pathological
material.
- No signs of the disease have appeared in commercial poultry farms in the
region.
- The reasons for the disease's lack of species specificity are still
unclear. Bacteriological and toxicological tests of samples of water and
soil from around the water and feeding points in the affected areas are
continuing.
- Newcastle disease virus was not found in samples from the affected areas.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(2) PCR: polymerase chain reaction
Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: Changes in the
obligations of OIE Member Countries to notify avian influenza ("notifiable
avian influenza"), which were adopted during the 73rd OIE General Session
in May 2005, will come into effect on 1 Jan 2006. The OIE Animal Health
Information Department is publishing the above report, based on the
official notification received from the Delegate of Russia, because of the
importance of monitoring the disease situation in Asia.
