[There are a couple of important issues to note with this
official confirmation. 1st, there is official OIE
notification from Turkey as well. Secondly, spread to Europe
has been relatively rapid, as the last official reports
placed the disease in the Urals. We will keep you updated.
Finally, this report contains no information confirming the
virus type as H5 or as H5N1, and one report below (Avian
influenza - Europe: Turkey, Romania, susp 20051010.2950)
suggests it may not be H5N1. - Mod.PC]
