[Basrah, in Southern Iraq, is situated about 120 km (about 75 mi) northern to the Al Rai live bird market in Al Farwaniyah, Kuwait, where HPAI H5N8 was recorded in late January 2019 (see 20190207.6305342). The disease was identified there in captive pet birds from different species kept in a pet shop at Al Rai live bird market.

Since October 2016, H5N8 HPAI has been spreading globally, mostly following wild bird migratory routes and affecting at least 91 species of wild birds and/or domestic birds in 54 different countries. One of the most severe affected countries has been Iran, where, since November 2016, 36 events have been reported in wild and domestic birds. - Mod.AS
