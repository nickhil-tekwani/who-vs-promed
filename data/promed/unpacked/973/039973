AUJESZKY'S DISEASE - EUROPE: (BELGIUM) WOLF

On 23 Dec 2011, Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) was detected in the
brain of a wolf in the province of Namur in Belgium. The wolf was held
in captivity in the wild animal reserve of Han-sur-Lesse near
Rochefort. After being fed with offal from a wild boar hunted in the
reserve, it started to show typical nervous symptoms associated with
ADV. The animal was necropsied by the veterinarians of the Regional
Association of Health and Animal Identification (ARSIA) and the brain
was sent to the Belgian reference laboratory for animal diseases
(CODA-CERVA) where it tested positive for Aujeszky's disease [AD] by
PCR. Virus isolation is ongoing.

Pigs and wild boars are the natural host for ADV and the only animals
to become latent carriers. European wild boar and feral pig
populations have been reported to be infected by ADV almost worldwide
in a variable proportion. Although the virus can infect nearly all
domesticated and wild mammals including cattle, sheep, goats, cats,
and dogs, these species are considered as dead-end hosts. ADV does not
infect humans. Since dogs and cats are particularly susceptible to the
ADV, and hunting dogs are exposed to an increased risk of infection,
the feeding of raw (wild) pig meat should be avoided, and suspected
animals with nervous symptoms should be presented to the
veterinarian.

A similar case was reported in 2007 in Belgium in 2 hunting dogs. Over
the last years, France, Germany, and Luxembourg have reported AD in
both dogs and wild boars. Commonly this occurs when hunting dogs come
into contact with infected wild boars, which are found to be infected
with ADV from time to time in Europe. Other European countries (Spain,
Portugal, Hungary, Italy, and Slovenia) have reported the disease in
wild boars since 2009.

Now that AD has been eradicated in Belgium, like in many other EU
Member States, and vaccination has been banned, pig producers should
be more than ever vigilant and watch for any of the symptoms of AD in
their animals. Transmission of ADV from wild boar to domestic pigs has
been described under experimental conditions. Since ADV is widespread
in wild boar populations, it is important to consider their possible
role as reservoir for the domestic pig. Symptoms include respiratory
distress, nervous signs (trembling, ataxia, and paralysis), sudden
death of young piglets, and abortion in pregnant sows. Producers are
asked to contact their local veterinarian if they notice these
symptoms. To avoid transmission of the disease from a wild reservoir,
producers must follow strict biosecurity measures on their farms and
avoid contact with wild boars.
