A bacterial disease that can cause significant reproductive losses in sheep is almost unknown to many of the producers it potentially affects. That's according to a recent survey conducted by Coopers Animal Health, which showed 47 per cent of respondents were unaware of the disease, campylobacteriosis (Campy), also known as vibriosis.

Coopers technical advisor Dr Damian O'Brien said the disease can have dire consequences for producers in high rainfall areas and has been found in the Gippsland and Western Districts of Victoria, southeast South Australia, Tasmania, and more recently southern NSW.

"The disease usually starts with one or 2 abortions in a flock, followed by a rapid increase in the abortion rate as the infection spreads. Maiden ewes are particularly at risk, as they often haven't been exposed to the bacteria before," Dr O'Brien said in a statement released by Coopers. "Ewes become vulnerable from mid-gestation, and the disease can cause lamb losses of up to 40 percent. Affected ewes have lost 12 months productivity." According to Coopers, animals normally become infected through ingesting contaminated pasture or water.

Abortions can occur from 3 months of pregnancy onwards, as well as stillbirths or the birth of weak lambs. Those lamb losses are often misdiagnosed as being caused by poor ewe nutrition, mis-mothering or put down to predation by foxes or wild dogs. According to Coopers, a useful tool in determining whether Campy is affecting a flock is pregnancy scanning. By comparing scanning rates with lamb marking percentages, producers can get an indication if there may be an issue with the disease in their flocks.

Nearly half of respondents in the Coopers survey stated they do not scan their ewes, meaning they don't know the true level of abortion in the flock.

"By not pregnancy scanning, it is very difficult to work out if ewes are being affected by in utero diseases like Campy, and then working with their vet to take appropriate steps to manage the problem," Dr O'Brien said. Coopers has also launched a new vaccine, Coopers Ovilis Campyvax, to help manage the disease. It says breeding ewes should be vaccinated at or prior to joining to minimise losses from the disease and improve the lambing and marking percentages for sheep producers.

[Ovine campylobacteriosis is an infectious disease of breeding ewes causing abortion in late pregnancy. It is caused by the bacterium _Campylobacter fetus_ ssp. _fetus_. The disease is found in sheep around the world but is an uncommon diagnosis in Western Australia. _Campylobacter_ sp. bacteria were previously known as _Vibrio_ species, and the disease has also been called vibriosis.

Note: _Campylobacter fetus_ ssp. _fetus_ can also infect humans, especially immunocompromised people, and may cause bacteraemia. Always wear disposable gloves and cover cuts and abrasions before handling aborted or potentially contaminated material. Always wash hands and change and wash clothes and disinfect shoes and equipment after handling contaminated material.

Signs of the disease
Ewes
- discharge from vulva for a few days, then
- sudden abortion in late pregnancy causing the ewe little trouble
- abortion rate increases rapidly over several days (average outbreak is 20 percent of the flock, but varies from 5-50 percent, with rates of up to 70 percent reported)
- birth of dead or weak lambs
- brownish discharge from the vulva for up to 2 weeks following abortion. (This discharge contains millions of the infectious bacteria.)
- up to 5 percent may die from blood poisoning following infection of the uterus.

It is rare for a recovered flock to have repeat outbreaks in successive years.

Lambs
- about 50 percent die in the uterus.
- liver lesions present in about 20 percent of aborted lambs (multiple 1-20 millimetre, yellowish circular areas)
- blood-tinged fluid in the cavities of the chest, abdomen and around the heart
- oedema (swelling) of subcutaneous tissues
- swollen placental membranes (afterbirth) with soft, pale orange cotyledons (buttons), instead of the normal red colour

Infection and spread:
Ewes are susceptible to infection during the 2nd half of pregnancy. Susceptible ewes ingest bacteria from contaminated pasture or water.

The bacteria enter the ewe's bloodstream and pass to the uterus where they multiply in the placenta, infect the placental membranes and cause abortion of the developing lamb. Abortion occurs one to 3 weeks after infection. Aborted lambs and the afterbirth contain large numbers of the _Campylobacter_ bacteria. When abortion occurs in a cool, moist environment, the bacteria survive and contaminate the area, allowing rapid spread of the disease to the rest of the flock.

When does ovine campylobacteriosis occur?
_Campylobacter_ abortion occurs mainly during cold, wet seasons.

In WA, there have been some outbreaks of the disease in late summer and autumn. The spread of infection in arid seasons is associated with sheep congregating around areas of hand-feeding and watering.

How does ovine campylobacteriosis enter a flock?
The initial entry of _Campylobacter_ to a flock is usually impossible to trace. Sheep and cattle may harbour the bacteria in the intestines and become a source of infection for flocks.

Wild animals and birds may also carry the bacteria from one flock to another or from one farm to another. Crows pass on the organism through their droppings and are attracted to hand feeding and watering points. Foxes are also believed to spread the disease.

Diagnosis
The presence of the round, yellow-white areas on the liver means the disease is likely to be ovine campylobacteriosis. To confirm diagnosis at a laboratory, veterinarians will need to provide samples of the foetal liver for selective campylobacter culture, placenta or maternal vaginal discharges, or formalin-fixed specimens of foetal liver for histopathology.

Treatment
There is no practical treatment to prevent _Campylobacter_ abortion. Once abortions commence, the placentas of infected ewes have already suffered damage.

Ewes that have aborted may be treated with antibiotics to reduce losses from uterine infection (metritis) or systemic infection.

Control
- Isolate aborting ewes
- Collect and burn aborted lambs and placental membranes. (Humans can become infected, so it is important to wear disposable gloves and cover cuts and abrasions before handling aborted or potentially contaminated material. Always wash hands and change and wash clothes and disinfect shoes and equipment after handling contaminated material.)
- Prevent contamination of feed and water by vaginal discharges and aborted lambs. This includes providing water troughs at dams or soaks.
- Do not sell ewes from an infected flock for breeding, as some may be carrier animals.
- Once infected, flocks usually develop good immunity.
