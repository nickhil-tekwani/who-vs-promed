On Thursday [20 Nov 2008], 25 new dengue patients were admitted to
different government hospitals in the eastern Pakistani city of
Lahore, bringing the total number of the dengue cases in the city to
1099. The total number of dengue patients admitted to various
hospitals of the Punjab province stands at 1150.

The private Geo TV quoted the Punjab Health Department as saying
Thursday [20 Nov 2008] that efforts were being made to control the
disease in the coming days ahead.

[The dengue outbreak in Lahore appears to be accelerating. The number
of cases reported there has increased from 681 on 11 Nov 2008
(see ProMED-mail archive no. 20081118.3636) to 1099 on 20 Nov 2008.
It would be interesting to know what measures are being taken to deal
with dengue virus transmission.

Karachi Dawn (<http://www.dawn.com/2008/07/30/local9.htm>) of 30 Jul
2008 reported that health authorities have now decided to shift the
unused cell separator, which was procured by the Sindh government in
its drive against dengue about a year back, to the Civil Hospital
Karachi at the earliest possible time. The high cost of platelet bags
has been an impediment to its use. A cell-separating machine was no
doubt the same dengue treatment machine referred to in the
ProMED-mail post no. 20081118.3636 on dengue in Punjab, India.

Hospitals in Hanoi have treated more than 500 dengue fever cases
during the past 2 weeks, causing alarm over outbreaks of diseases
following recent floods in the capital.

Hospitals report that the number of patients, mainly young people, is
2 times higher than the same period last year [2007]. Many of these
recent cases are serious, said Bui Nguyen Kiem, the head of Saint
Paul Hospital's Internal Medicine Department No 2, which treats 7
dengue fever cases every day.

Kiem said many of the patients did not use mosquito nets at night and
delayed their visit to the hospital instead of checking in as soon as
they had fever symptoms.

"The initial symptoms of this fever are similar to other kinds of
fevers, so many people were only taken to the hospital when their
fevers became serious and difficult to treat," said Kiem.

Doctors recommend people use mosquito nets when they go to sleep and
keep their living environment dry and clean to eradicate all
conditions, which could permit the disease vectors to reproduce and
develop.

[In the post-flooding environment, large areas with standing water
serve as excellent breeding places for _Aedes_ spp mosquitoes --
the vectors for dengue fever. It is noteworthy that this current
announcement relates to Hanoi and surrounding areas. Usually dengue
activity is greater in the southern region of the country. The past
year (2007-2008) has been a major one for dengue in the MBDS region
(references below refer to prior reports on dengue fever in Viet Nam,
but there have been reports of significant dengue activity in
neighboring countries in the region as well). It is disconcerting
that the numbers of cases remains high without significant abatement.

[3] New Caledonia

For the 1st time in 30 years, a person in New Caledonia has been
diagnosed with type 4 dengue fever [virus; DENV-4]. Health
authorities say the infected woman is in the Northern Province and
had never travelled to the parts of the Pacific where DENV-4 is
currently prevalent, such as Fiji.

New Caledonia commonly has DENV-1 [virus], with some 1000 people
suffering from it this year [2008]. A few cases of DENV-4 had earlier
been detected, but only in people who had been exposed to the virus
through travel [elsewhere] in the region.
