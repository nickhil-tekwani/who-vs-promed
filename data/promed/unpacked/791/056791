Sweden's Public Health Authority, or Folkhalsomyndigheten, is reporting an outbreak of hepatitis A where the suspected source of infection is fresh dates from Iran. Of the 9 cases reported since late February 2019, 8 are confirmed and have the same type of hepatitis A virus (genotype IIIA); one case is suspected. The cases are between the ages of 28 and 73 years; 5 are men and 4 are women. The cases are from 7 different counties (Orebro, Stockholm, Uppsala, Skane, Sodermanland, Kalmar and Halland). The latest case became ill on 16 Apr 2019. Common to the cases is that they regularly eat fresh dates.

In the 8 confirmed cases, 4 different strains with genotype IIIA have been detected. Two of these are similar to those that caused an outbreak in Denmark in 2018 linked to dates from Iran. In that outbreak, several variants of genotype IIIA strains could be detected in the cases. One of these outbreak strains could also be detected in dates.

Health officials continue the investigation to identify the source of the outbreak.

[This outbreak seems to be related to a specific food vehicle as has been usual in the developed world in the past few decades and is unlike what is occurring in the USA, where large outbreaks of hepatitis A virus are occurring "the old fashion way" related to inadequate sanitation as occurs in the low and middle income countries. - Mod.LL
