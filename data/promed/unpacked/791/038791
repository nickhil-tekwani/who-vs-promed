_Burkholderia gladioli_, a new maize disease in Mexico. J Phytopath
2010; DOI: 10.1111/j.1439-0434.2010.01776.x]
------------------
A disease in maize plants, not previously observed, appeared in 2003 -
2004 in Cosoleacaque, Tlalixcoyan, and Paso de Ovejas counties, in the
state of Veracruz, Mexico.

Initial symptoms on leaves were small white-yellow watery spots, which
coalesced into dry necrotic stripes 0.3 cm wide and up to 8 cm long.
Reddening sometimes developed on these leaves. Stems developed a rot
in the crown. The flag leaf became rotted and necrotic at the base,
rolled inwards and dried out. Necrosis developed at the base of the
ears and their growth was inhibited. These symptoms were initially
observed in commercial maize plantings.

A bacterium characterized by white, opaque, round colonies with entire
margins, gram negative, aerobic and rod-shaped was consistently
isolated from diseased maize plants. The bacterium's identity was
confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing of 16S and 23S rDNA gene
fragments. The bacterium was identified as _Burkholderia gladioli_.
Its pathogenicity on maize plants in Mexico is a new record.

[_B. gladioli_ (formerly _Pseudomonas gladioli_ or _P. marginata_) was
initially described in 1921 as a soil inhabiting phytopathogen of
gladioli and other flowers. It causes, for example, bulb soft rot of
onion; scab, soft and corm rots of gladiolus, iris, freesia, and other
flower crops; soft rot of orchids with up to 50 percent loss; grain
rot, panicle blight, and leaf-sheath browning of rice plants
(sometimes together with other species in the genus).

The pathogen is spread in soil and water, by mechanical means
(including insects), and with infected plant material. Disease
management includes the use of clean planting material and cultural
practices such as frequent disinfection of tools, insect control, and
reduction of free moisture in plantings.

_B. gladioli_ is a heterogeneous species with phenotypic and genetic
variability and has been divided into pathovars, including _gladioli_,
_alliicola_ and _agaricicola_, based on their host ranges. Strains
assisting in nitrogen fixation have been found in the rhizospheres of
a number of cereals and sugarcane. Some strains are nematode and
fungal antagonists and can be used in biocontrol (for example for
_Fusarium_ species); some strains are plant growth promoters. Strains
producing human toxins or associated with infections in humans have
also been reported.

An ear soft rot of maize caused by _B. gladioli_ has been reported
from Brazil and the USA (see ProMED-mail post 20080123.0283). No
information seems to be available regarding the pathovars for either
of the 2 reported diseases of maize.
