---------------------------------------------------------------------
In the ProMed post released on 26 May 2019, ProMED cites a [24 May 2019] KRQE report stating that the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDoH) reported the state's 1st hantavirus case in 2019. The KRQE article also stated that there were no cases in New Mexico in 2018 and 5 cases in 2017. The moderator responded, stating: "The above report is incorrect in that there were 2 cases in 2018, ...." The moderator's report of 2 cases in 2018 is incorrect in that there were no cases in New Mexico in 2018 (https://nmhealth.org/data/view/infectious/890/).

Much of the recent confusion regarding laboratory confirmation of hantavirus infection is related to IgM positive, IgG negative hantavirus antibody results that cannot be confirmed. On [2 May 2018], NMDoH released a Health Alert Network (HAN) Alert titled: "Issues with Commercially Available Hantavirus Rapid Antibody Testing and Increase in False Positives" (https://nmhealth.org/publication/view/general/4742/). The report described "5 recent false positive IgM results (that were not confirmed by CDC)."

[ProMED-mail thanks Dr Mertz for correcting the record on absence of hantavirus (Sin Nombre) infections in New Mexico in 2018. Dr Mertz has indicated that the 2018 KRQU News reports of hantavirus infections of a 9-year-old boy and 27-year-old woman were false positives for those infections. ProMED-mail regrets the confusion that those 2018 reports may have caused. - Mod.TY
