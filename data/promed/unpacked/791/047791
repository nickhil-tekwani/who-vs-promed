Health chief sounds tomato warning
----------------------------------
Victorian health authorities have renewed their warnings over links between
semi-dried tomatoes and an outbreak of hepatitis A following a further 23
cases of the infectious disease diagnosed in the past week. Victoria's
chief health officer Dr John Carnie said that so far this year [2009] there
had been 200 notifications of hepatitis A, compared to 74 at the same time
last year [2008].

A study into the increase of cases indicates that more than two thirds of
people that have become ill recalled eating semi-dried tomatoes, he said.
"Because the incubation period for hepatitis A could be as long as 2
months, trying to get people who fell ill to accurately pin down what and
where they actually ate this product can be difficult," Dr Carnie told
reporters. "We still are unclear as to why there has been a recent spike in
cases in Victoria. However, we are continuing to work with the
manufacturers and suppliers of semi-dried tomatoes to try and identify the
source." Local producers had promised the Department of Human Services they
were doing their best to reduce the risk, while importers of the tomatoes
had also been instructed to ensure appropriate quality control measures
were in place, he said.

Bottled semi-dried tomatoes in supermarkets were pasteurised and considered
safe along with any of the cooked product such as in pizzas or quiches. The
greatest risk would appear to be at restaurants and cafes, where semi-dried
tomatoes are served in foods such as salads and sandwiches.

Hepatitis A involves inflammation of the liver and is spread when traces of
faecal matter containing the virus contaminates hands, objects, water, or
food and is then taken in through the mouth. Symptoms include abdominal
pain, nausea, fever and chills, and jaundice.

[Hepatitis A virus contamination of semi-dried tomatoes seems to be a
recurrent problem throughout Australia, but particularly in the state of
Victoria. It is surprising that the source of the contamination remains
unidentified.
