Authorities have confirmed an outbreak of a mild form of bird flu in turkeys in Kandiyohi County.

The State Board of Animal Health says testing on Monday [22 Oct 2018] showed the presence of a low pathogenic H5N2 virus in a flock of 40 000 turkeys. The virus originated in wild birds. The affected turkeys have been quarantined but have shown no signs of illness.

Officials are careful to note that the virus is different from the highly pathogenic virus that caused a massive outbreak in U.S. turkeys and chickens in 2015, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 50 million birds. Minnesota was among the hardest hit states in that outbreak.

A mild form of bird flu detected in one flock of turkeys in a west-central Minnesota county is not the same virus that caused a devastating outbreak in 2015 and poses no public health or food safety risk, officials said Tuesday [23 Oct 2018].

The World Organisation for Animal Health said routine surveillance testing confirmed on Monday [22 Oct 2018] the presence of a low-pathogenic H5N2 virus in a flock of 40 000 turkeys in Kandiyohi County, Minnesota's top turkey producing county. The virus originated in wild birds. The state Board of Animal Health said only 1 of 4 barns on the farm -- housing 10 000 13-week-old toms -- was affected.

The flock has been quarantined but has shown no signs of illness, the agencies said. The farm will be allowed to market the birds normally in a few weeks once the flock tests negative, said Dr. Shauna Voss, senior veterinarian at the board's poultry testing laboratory in Willmar.

The board has stepped up surveillance at nearby poultry farms as a precaution.

The virus is different from the highly pathogenic H5N2 virus that caused a massive outbreak in U.S. turkeys and chickens in 2015, which resulted in the deaths of more than 50 million birds. Iowa and Minnesota were by far the hardest hit states. Losses across the U.S. economy were estimated at USD 3.3 billion.

Voss said this was the 1st detection of any avian influenza virus in commercial poultry in Minnesota since that outbreak, although there was a low-pathogenic case in western Wisconsin last year [2017].

The 2015 outbreak led to tighter biosecurity measures on poultry farms to protect them from outside sources of infection, such as wild birds, rodents and farm workers who might track in viruses on their footwear or clothing. Producers now conduct enhanced surveillance during the spring and fall migrations, Voss said.

The new detection shows those security measures have paid off, she said.

[Following the 2015 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreak that occurred in central Minnesota, increased surveillance has been implemented during the spring and fall months. This routine surveillance detected a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 in a commercial meat-type turkey flock. The flock was healthy and not showing any clinical signs of AI. Partial HA/NA sequencing determined the H5 and N2 to be a low pathogenic virus of North American wild bird lineage. Further characterization is pending virus recovery. The Minnesota Board of Animal Health (BAH) and USDA, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services (APHIS) are conducting an epidemiological investigation of the event and have increased surveillance in the area as a result of this detection. State officials have quarantined the affected premises and implemented movement controls.

It always takes continual vigilance to prevent and minimize disease. Biosecurity of workers and everyone entering the premises, including veterinarians, is vitally important. Prevention measures regarding wild birds and rodents are critical in keeping down the chances of an infestation. Part of biosecurity is early detection of one or a few ill birds. Fortunately, this seems contained to one barn. We hope it does not spread.

Hopefully, this will not turn into something bigger but that the birds will test negative quickly. - Mod.TG
