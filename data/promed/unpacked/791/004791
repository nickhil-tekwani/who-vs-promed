CASEOUS LYMPHADENITIS, SHEEP - UK (02)

I read with interest the Electronic Telegraph news release on Caseous
Lymphadenitis, posted on the 20th.
Caseous Lymphadenitis is widespread throughout Australia's sheep flocks. It
is predominantly a non-progressive disease resulting in small but measurable
production loss, not acute fatalities. Human cases are very rare (if any)
and it is not considered a zoonosis of any consequence. Control is effected
through a specific, inexpensive vaccine, which substantially reduces the
prevalence of the disease when used at the appropriate time in the sheep's
life (ie. before it becomes infected).

CLA is endemic in Australia, and the disease is not seen as a major on-farm
problem, granted that it is a problem in abattoirs. I think it is
interesting to see the social or psycological effect of diseases, when they
are new to a country or region, that have very little economic impact or
animal impact. eg Ovine Johne's disease in New Zealand and Ovine Johne's
disease in Victoria.
The greatest effect seems to be that they are new.
What is being done in an attempt to control CLA on a regional basis and
on-farm [in the UK]?

[I think it is dangerous to freely extrapolate the economics of the endemic
condition to those with a newly introduced disease, as the former absorbs
many of the costs involved. Secondly, if one does not have a disease, do you
really want it? and widespread? Vide the present EU policies concerning
livestock & animal movements. Having seen this disease introduced into
Jamaica, I am certain I would not want it in my flock or region when one is
free of it. I suspect that shooting the first cases with owner compensation
is much cheaper than everyone later having to vaccinate, even at
pennies/beast/year.
Have any UK ProMED members experience with this disease in the UK and would
they share it with us? MHJ Mod]
