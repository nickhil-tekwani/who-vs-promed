Japan, Mexico, Canada block fresh potato imports because of pest
-----------------------------------------------
Japan has banned all fresh U.S. potato imports, and Canada and Mexico
all fresh potato imports from Idaho, after a microscopic wormlike
pest called the potato cyst nematode was found on an eastern Idaho
farm this week.
The discovery of the pest was the 1st time this particular nematode
has been detected in the United States, said Pat Takasugi, director
of Idaho's Department of Agriculture.
Takasugi said Friday [21 April 2006] he doesn't expect any U.S.
states to ban Idaho potatoes, because his agency and the U.S.
Department of Agriculture have quarantined fields and a shed at the
farm where the nematodes were found.
"We have definitely caught this in the early stages," Takasugi said.
The bans by the 3 countries only involve fresh potatoes not those
processed into French fries and other food products.
The pest is not harmful to humans and doesn't have any effect on the
potatoes themselves, Takasugi said. But it feeds on the roots of the
potato plant and can reduce crop production by as much as 80 percent.
Idaho is the nation's largest potato producer, growing about 1/3rd of
all the potatoes in the United States. Last year [2005], the state
produced 12.5 billion pounds of potatoes that paid farmers about USD
700 million, said Frank Muir, president of the Idaho Potato
Commission. Muir estimated the industry is worth about USD 2 billion
to the state.
There are several nematodes that affect potato crops; a cousin to the
one found in Idaho has been found in New York and British Columbia
and has prompted Canada to impose some trade restrictions on New York
potatoes, said Alain Boucher, a seed potato specialist with the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency. The nematode found in Idaho also has
been detected in the eastern Canadian province of Newfoundland, Takasugi said.
"It's a major pest in a potato state," said Takasugi, adding that 500
acres of fields at the farm where the nematode was found have been
quarantined as well as the shed used for potato storage. "That's why
we've taken the most extreme measures to confine and isolate."
Potato industry experts hastened to assure consumers that the pest is
not harmful to humans and that the 2 nematodes found were discovered
after years of intensive testing.
The state Agriculture Department has been testing soil samples for
more than 20 years, Takasugi said. The department has taken more than
10 000 samples in the last 3 years alone, "on soil, in farms, and on
processing plants, and every one has been negative for the potato
cyst nematode until this one find," Muir said. "Our researchers
literally found the needle in the haystack."
Farmers, too, do their own tests for this nematode, said Keith
Esplin, a former potato grower who is executive director of the
Potato Growers of Idaho in Blackfoot.
"All indications are that it's a very minor infestation," Esplin
said. "We want to be careful we don't spread it around or introduce
it, but it doesn't appear that that's happened. I think we caught it in time."
It was not immediately clear how much the Canadian, Mexican, and
Japanese markets are worth to Idaho. The annual value of all fresh
potato exports from the United States is USD 100 million, said
Melissa O'Dell, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
Canada is Idaho's largest export market for fresh potatoes, Muir
said. Idaho produces 1/3rd of the U.S. potatoes shipped to Mexico.
Idaho has invited Japan, Mexico and Canada to send health inspectors
to observe how Idaho was handling the infestation, and Takasugi and
Muir said they were confident all 3 countries would soon reopen trading.
"After they see the data, the tests, and everything we've done, the
recommendation will probably be to lift that ban," Takasugi said.

[The crop plant potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) is susceptible to the
potato cyst nematode (PCN). It is found in many places where potatoes
are grown, including Europe. There are 2 species of PCN affecting
crops. The white or pale PCN (_Globodera pallida_) is now believed to
be the more dominant species in Europe, while the yellow or golden
PCN (_G. rostochiensis_) still causes serious losses in some areas.
Prior to this report [21 Apr 2006], _G. pallida_ was only known in
Newfoundland, Canada in N. America (see link for worldwide
distribution map). _G. rostochiensis_ is known in New York state in
mainland USA and on Vancouver Island, British Columbia and
Newfoundland in Canada. Because of an effective US State and Federal
quarantine which has been in existence for over 50 years, PCN/GN
remains confined to portions of 9 counties within the state of New
York. These 2 pathogens were described in some detail in a recent
post [20060413.1092], which should be consulted along with this post.
Potato cyst nematodes are major pests of the potato crop in
cool-temperate areas. This situation is, at present, more serious in
the case of _G. pallida_ because of the lack of commercially
available potato cultivars having resistance to this species. The
amount of damage, particularly in relation to the weight of tubers
produced, is closely related to the number of nematode eggs per unit
of soil. It has been estimated that approximately 2 t/ha of potatoes
are lost for every 20 eggs/g soil. Up to 80 percent of the crop can
be lost when nematode populations are raised to very high levels by
repeated cultivation of potatoes.
This 1st report of white/pale PCN (_Globodera pallida_) in the USA on
a single farm in eastern Idaho is clearly very significant nationally
as well as to Idaho. The farm has been placed under quarantine
regulations. Despite the very restricted location, the discovery has
already resulted in quarantines being places on potatoes. Japan has
banned all fresh U.S. potato imports, and Canada and Mexico all fresh
potato imports from Idaho. It is to be hoped that the confidence
expressed by the State of Idaho's Department of Agriculture that this
isolated outbreak can be contained is a correct assessment. The past
exhaustive and up till now negative testing in Idaho that is
described in the article should be grounds for confidence, but I
anticipate more news on this topic in the immediate future. It is
worth noting the following quote taken from the 1st of the "Links:"
"Because of yield loss and adverse regulatory impact caused by this
nematode, the risk posed by this pest to the United States is very high."
