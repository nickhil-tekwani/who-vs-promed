2013 wheat leaf rust survey
---------------------------
In 2013 wheat leaf rust was widely distributed across the US from the Great Plains to the east coast, but was generally found at low levels. Inoculum levels from Texas into the central and northern Great Plains were low due to cooler spring temperatures, dry conditions, and the application of fungicides.

Races with virulence to both Lr39/41 [host resistance genes] that is present in many hard red winter wheat cultivars grown from Texas to Kansas, and Lr21 that is in many hard red spring wheat cultivars, were present in Texas and Minnesota. Races with virulence to Lr3ka, Lr11, Lr26, and Lr18 were most common in the soft red winter wheat areas of the south eastern states and Ohio Valley. In the hard red wheat area of the southern and northern Great Plains races with virulence to Lr24, Lr17, Lr21, and Lr39/41 were the commonest.

Estimated losses in wheat due to leaf rust of 1-2 per cent occurred in [some states] with trace level of losses in others.

[Leaf rust (also called brown rust) of wheat is caused by the fungus _Puccinia recondita_ (synonym _P. triticina_). Related pathogens affect barley and rye. The disease reduces the photosynthetic potential of the plant and can cause serious yield losses of over 40 per cent in individual fields. Symptoms include brick-red pustules on leaves, stems, and later on heads. Infection of the host can occur in as little as 4 hours in favourable conditions. Epidemic severity increases exponentially over time and may appear to "explode" suddenly during favourable weather.

Spores are produced as the crop ripens and are spread by wind and mechanical means. The fungus is not soil-borne. It needs living tissue to survive between seasons and cannot survive on seed, stubble, or in soil. Volunteer cereal plants and certain wild grasses may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum to infect new crops. Disease management relies mainly on timely fungicide applications, choice of crop cultivars, and control of volunteer crop plants. Crop monitoring is important for early discovery of infection so action can be taken to limit pathogen spread as well as build-up of inoculum.

New strains of leaf rust with increased virulence are emerging worldwide. These include strains that show additional fungicide resistances and/or the ability to break down genetic resistance of specific host varieties. Monitoring programmes, like the one reported above from the US, have been established in different countries for early detection of new rust strains. They are often linked to regional resistance breeding programmes to attempt to stay ahead of pathogen evolution.
