The Mexican Ministry of Health has reported an outbreak of mumps in the country, many affecting university students, with outbreaks reported in Mexico City, Sonora and Chihuahua, according to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (SINAVE) (computer translated).

Through [13 Apr 2018] 2619 cases of mumps have been reported in the country. The states with the highest number of cases are: Tamaulipas-561 (21 percent), Nuevo Le√≥n with 302 (12 percent), Quintana Roo with 203 (8 percent), Jalisco with 189 (7 percent) and Chihuahua with 167 (6 percent).

The most affected age groups nationwide are adults from 25 to 44 years old, with 805 (31 percent), followed by the group of 20 to 24 years old with 531 (20 percent) and children from 5 to 9 years old, with 388 (15 percent).

Last year, Mexico reported a total of 4653 cases of mumps.

Mumps: Why it's seen a resurgence
---------------------------------
Mumps is an acute infectious disease caused by the mumps virus. It is spread via coughing, sneezing, kissing, sharing glasses or utensils, and touching a surface that has the virus on it. Mumps is suspected when there is swelling of one or more of the saliva glands. The swelling may just be on one side, but is more commonly on both. Sometimes the glands under the tongue or jaw are affected also. Other possible symptoms of mumps include: fever, headache, earache, tiredness, sore muscles, dry mouth, poor appetite, and trouble talking, chewing, or swallowing.

Before the swelling occurs, flu-like symptoms appear in about half of those who get the virus. In children under 5, mumps can show up as a lung infection. Fever usually lasts 1 to 6 days but enlargement of the glands may go on for 10 days or longer. A few people may have little or no symptoms but can still spread the virus. When a person is exposed to mumps, it usually takes from 16 to 18 days for them to get sick, but it can range from 12 to 25 days. The virus is most contagious from 2 days before the swelling starts until 5 days after it goes away.

Waning vaccine-derived immunity linked to mumps re-emergence: Study
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Globally, the World Health Organization has reported 585 315 cases of mumps in the present year through [13 Feb 2018], distributed as follows: Pacific West 57 percent (335 304), Africa 17 percent (100 576), East Mediterranean 13 percent (75 680), Southeast Asia 5 percent (31 739), Europe 4 percent (20 874) and the Americas 3 percent (21 142). The countries that have the largest number of reported cases are Japan 175 001 cases and China 159 031 cases.

[See URL above for infographic aimed at college students depicting symptoms of mumps and steps they can take to protect themselves.]

[Research using mumps vaccine effectiveness data and dynamic transmission modeling from Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health shows the increase in mumps in college age students is likely because protection can decline years after receiving the vaccine. While it is expected that 50 percent of people will retain protection for 19 years after receiving a mumps-containing vaccine, many people will maintain protection far longer, so the population average is about 27 years," according to J Lewnard, Research Associate, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The vaccine is nearly 90 percent effective after 2 doses, but a 3rd booster dose has been used to cut down on future cases, either in response to outbreaks or to prevent outbreaks.

Traders in Bankers Goldman Sachs infected with Mumps
----------------------------------------------------
Goldman Sachs is battling to contain a rare but contagious flare-up of mumps after a few employees contracted the disease. Employees on one of its trading floors showed signs of the disease this week and the firm told people to get shots or visit the firm's health center if they didn't receive the vaccine during childhood, according to a person with knowledge of the matter who asked to remain anonymous discussing internal conditions....-more

[Complications of mumps happen more often among adults than children, and may include: meningitis or encephalitis (inflammation of the membrane that covers the brain and spinal cord or inflammation of the brain), orchitis (inflammation of one or both testicles), mastitis (inflammation of breast tissue), parotitis (inflammation of one or both parotid glands), oophoritis (inflammation of one or both ovaries), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), deafness. https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/healthlibrary/conditions/infectious_diseases/mumps_in_adults_85,P00639. - Mod.LK]
