The Malawi Ministry of Health released data today [Thu 17 Jun 2010] showing
that the country now has reported 12 000 measles cases and 70 deaths. The
government of Malawi has scheduled July 2010 as the start date for
vaccination of all children aged 6 months to 15 years. As the epidemic has
spread much faster than previously expected, the Ministry of Health has
decided on immediate implementation of a vaccination campaign.

Outbreaks of measles have occurred recently in the neighboring states of
Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Tanzania.

Measles is a common childhood acute respiratory disease, highly contagious,
but which can be contained by a comprehensive vaccination programme.

[As elsewhere in eastern and southern Africa in the past year, there has
been a resurgence of measles virus infection following relaxation of
childhood vaccination programmes due to funding and other problems (see
ProMED-mail post: Measles - Africa (16) 20100619.2063).

In Malawi since Mon 10 May 2010, the number of cases of measles has
increased from 3026 to the current figure of about 12 000 with 70
fatalities. It is hoped that the resumption of comprehensive childhood
vaccination about to be implemented by the Malawi healthcare authorities
will reverse the current resurgence of measles virus infection.
