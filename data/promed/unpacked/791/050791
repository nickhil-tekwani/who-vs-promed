BUCHAREST
According to local health officials, more than 100 Romanians in the
northwestern city of Baia Mare were taken to hospital with food poisoning
after eating infected pork. The disease, characterised by nausea, fever
and swelling of muscles, is caused by eating pork infected with trichina
larvae.
