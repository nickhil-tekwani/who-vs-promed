In response to media enquiries on cases of hepatitis A, the spokesperson for the Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) responded today (15 Apr 2015) as follows:

"Hepatitis A is a statutory notifiable infectious disease in Hong Kong. CHP will carry out epidemiological investigations for every cases of hepatitis A in due course to understand whether the patients had consumed high risk-food like shellfish and berries during the incubation period, and will implement appropriate preventive and control measures.

As of yesterday (14 Apr 2015), CHP has recorded 64 cases of hepatitis A infection this year, comprising 32 males and 32 females aged 11 to 83. All patients are in stable condition with no death recorded. Among them, only 19 cases had consumed various types of berries, while only 8 of them had consumed blueberries during the incubation period. Epidemiological investigations so far did not show sufficient evidence of epidemiological linkage between the increase of hepatitis A cases and eating blueberries."

In 2012, 2013 and 2014, the yearly totals of hepatitis A cases were 43, 44 and 46 cases respectively.

Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by the fecal-oral route either through contaminated drinks or food such as shellfish, or directly from person to person. The members of public should take heed of the preventive measures below against hepatitis A:

- Wash hands properly with liquid soap and water before eating or handling food, and after going to the toilet or changing diapers;
- Purchase fresh food from reliable sources and do not patronise illegal hawkers;
- Drinking water should be from the mains and preferably boiled;
- Avoid high-risk food like shellfish, raw food or semi-cooked food;
- Clean and wash food thoroughly.

Scrub and rinse shellfish in clean water. Remove the viscera if appropriate; for food to be consumed without cooking, e.g. fruits, clean and wash thoroughly;
- Cook food thoroughly.

All shellfish should be cooked at boiling temperature for not less than 5 minutes before eating;
- Keep the premises and kitchen utensils clean; and
- Dispose of rubbish properly.

The public may visit the CHP's hepatitis A page (http://www.chp.gov.hk/en/content/9/24/24.html) and a related article in "Food Safety Focus" of the Centre for Food Safety (http://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/multimedia/multimedia_pub/multimedia_pub_fsf_105_03.html) for more information.

"HAV [hepatitis A virus] is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, either by a direct contact with a contagious person infected with HAV or by ingestion of HAV-contaminated food or water or from contaminated surfaces [2]. The average incubation period of HA is 28 days (range: 15-50 days) [3]. The period of highest infectiousness is assumed to range from 2 weeks before until 1 week after onset of jaundice. Viral shedding with highest HAV concentration in stool occurs before jaundice [4].

Food items that have been described or assumed to have caused HA outbreaks include mussels, oysters, vegetables and salad fertilized with feces [5,6], fruits including raw blueberries [7], frozen raspberries [8], frozen strawberries [9], green onions [10] and shellfish [11]. Contamination of food by infected food handlers in restaurants has also been described [12]. Several HA outbreaks have been associated with bakeries [13]. In an outbreak observed in 1968 in Michigan, United States (USA), the vehicle of infection was pastries covered with glaze or icing [14]. In an outbreak in New York, US, HA was associated with sugar-glazed baked goods [15]. An HA outbreak took place in Germany in 2004 where a bakery employee most probably contaminated the products that caused the outbreak [13].

The tenacity of HAV is higher than of other non-enveloped viruses belonging to the family of Picornaviridae. The ability of HAV to survive on hands and on inanimate surfaces plays an important role for HAV transfer from hands of infectious persons to food items and from contaminated surfaces to fingertips [16,17]. Disinfection with alcohol and hydrogen peroxide (3 percent and 6 percent concentration) has been found ineffective against HAV on surfaces [18]. According to Mbithi, unmedicated liquid soap was ineffective for reducing virus titer on hands [18], indicating that hand washing with ordinary soap is not sufficient to prevent HAV transmission. HAV is acid-stable [19] and seems to remain viable while passing through the stomach [1]. The minimum infectious dose is estimated to be very low with 10-100 virus particles. The amount of HAV shed by infected humans ranges from 106 to 108 virus particles per 1 gram of stool [20,21]." - Mod.LL
