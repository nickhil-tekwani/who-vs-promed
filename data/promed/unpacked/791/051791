Avian flu found on 2 more British Columbia farms
------------------------------------------------
ABBOTSFORD, British Columbia -- The number of Fraser Valley commercial
poultry operations infected with avian influenza has grown to 31, the
Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has announced. The 2 latest sites,
located within a cluster of infected farms near this town a few miles north
of Sumas, Wash, were confirmed Monday as Canadian and British Columbia
officials met at Abbotsford.
Ten so-called backyard poultry operations in the valley also have been
found to have the fast-spreading virus, which can kill entire flocks within
days. Bob Bugslag, director of the Provincial Emergency Program, said
dozens of extra staff ordered last week by British Columbia Premier Gordon
Campbell have begun preparing to help with the destruction of more than a
million infected birds. As many as 150 federal employees and a similar
number of provincial workers should be on-site on Tuesday, Bugslag said.
The Agriculture Ministry hopes to eliminate the entire Fraser Valley
poultry population of 19 million by May 21. Carcasses of infected birds
will be incinerated, composted or -- as a last resort -- stuffed into
sealed bags and buried in landfills. The kill order extends to non-infected
flocks within a kilometer, about six-tenths of a mile, from any infected
farm. Disease-free poultry may be processed for retail sales to consumers.

Pigeon owners get reprieve from avian cull; virus spread appears to be slowing
------------------------------------------
ABBOTSFORD, BC: Pigeon owners in the avian influenza-infested Fraser Valley
will be spared the extermination that has befallen hundreds of thousands of
chickens and turkeys. Cornelius Kiley, veterinarian with the Canadian Food
Inspection Agency, said pigeons don't contract avian influenza, nor do they
carry it.
"Based on risk assessment of the susceptibility of pigeons to contract
avian influenza, we are essentially exempting pigeons from the depopulation
orders," Kiley said in a conference call with reporters. "Pigeons do not
get avian influenza and don't carry the virus," he said. However, pigeons
can carry the virus in their feathers and spread it to other fowl. As a
result, the movement of hobby pigeons must remain restricted, he said.
Since it was first detected in February on one farm, authorities have been
dealing with the spreading avian influenza nemesis through the Fraser
Valley, the province's agricultural lifeblood. As of Tuesday, the number of
commercial BC poultry operations infected with avian influenza stood at 31.
The figure does not include 10 so-called backyard poultry operations in the
valley that were found to have the fast-spreading virus, which can quickly
kill flocks within days. The agency announced earlier that in order to deal
with the outbreak and eradicate it completely, some 19 million birds,
mostly chickens and turkeys, would be killed in the Fraser Valley between
Vancouver and Hope.
The infected poultry are being gassed in sealed barns using carbon dioxide
and their carcasses incinerated at landfills. Poultry not infected will go
to market as usual. "We have now depopulated all birds from every infected
premises," said Kiley. "The fact that we have found only 2 new cases in the
past 6 days suggests that we may be getting ahead of this disease."
The 31 commercial operations -- or flocks -- represent about 954 000 birds,
of which 81 per cent have already been eliminated and disposed of. The
method of extermination of the birds involves pumping carbon dioxide gas
into sealed barns, said Kiley. The birds fall asleep from the gas, then
fall into a deeper sleep before dying. "It's considered one of the best
methods," he said. But the method has come under fire from some animal
welfare groups, including the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals,
and one of their celebrity supporters, Pamela Anderson. Anderson wrote a
letter to federal Agriculture Minister Bob Speller, complaining that the
extermination methods were not the most humane available. She asked that
the authorities use nitrogen or argon gas. But Kiley said research has
shown carbon dioxide is more humane.
Meanwhile, authorities are still working on whether other birds besides
pigeons should be exempted from the cull. Owners of farmed ostriches and
one couple who runs a parrot sanctuary have been worried their birds might
be needlessly exterminated. But Kiley said the agency wanted to move
carefully when dealing with possible exemptions to the cull order. "The
early decisions will set a blueprint so we want to make sure we do it right
from the get-go. The Agriculture Ministry has set May 21 as the date for
eliminating the entire Fraser Valley poultry population of 19 million birds.
