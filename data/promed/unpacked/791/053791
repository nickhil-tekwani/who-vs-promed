[A presentation titled "Prion disease in dromedary camels in North Africa" was included in the 2nd session of the REMESA [Mediterranean Animal Health Network] meeting, Cairo, 26-27 Jun 2019 and is available at http://www.rr-africa.oie.int/docspdf/en/2019/REMESA18/session%202/9%20Remesa_26_27_June_2019.pdf

From the said presentation, slide no. 6 is copied as follows:

CPD [camel prion disease]: what we know
---------------------------------------
1. CPD is a novel prion disease
2. It has been reported in Algeria (Prof Baaissaa Babelhadj) and Tunisia (Prof Abdelkader Amara, Ecole Veterinaire, Sidi Thabet)
3. It affects adult animals
4. In the Ouargla Region (Algeria), where CPD has been first identified, its incidence is rapidly and progressively increasing (Baaissa, personal communication)
5. The involvement of the lymphoreticular system suggests CPD is an infectious prion disease
6. Preliminary results suggest that the CPD prion strain is different from scrapie and BSE [bovine spongiform encephalitis]

[The presentation above was authored and presented during the REMESA (REseau MEditerranéen de Santé Animale or Mediterranean Animal Health Network) meeting by Pr Umberto Agrimi from the Istituto Superiore di Sanita (ISS), Italy. According to article 2 in the text above, Tunisia has become the 2nd country in which a novel prion disease, designated CPD, has been discovered in dromedary camels. The 1st cases of CPD were published in April 2018 (see 20180414.5746593). They were detected in central-eastern Algeria in the slaughterhouse of Ouargla (about 280 km/174 mi from the Tunisian border; map at https://goo.gl/maps/WEPZ2hHhhHBW6fRd9). The observations involved several clinically affected old (over 8 years) dromedary camels which eventually were diagnosed as a prion disease which is not identical to BSE or scrapie. The location of detection is of little significance in view of the long distanced camels are known to make during their life. The published paper (ref 1) includes links to 3 video clips showing the observed clinical signs; Agrimi was among its authors.

Tunisia has thus become the 2nd country where CPD has been described in (local?) dromedary camels, within about one year. The source of the information cited by Agrimi, Prof Abdelkader Amara, Tunisia's national veterinary school at Sidi Thabet, is also Director of the laboratory for research on animal prion diseases. Amara serves as the President of the National Association of Veterinary Surgeons of Tunisia.

The CPD findings in Algeria were discussed during OIE's recent, 87th General Session in late May 2019 in Paris, and summarised as follows:

"146. Prion disease in dromedary camels
---------------------------------------
"The Scientific Commission took note of the opinion of the ad hoc Group on BSE risk status evaluation and of the ad hoc Group on diseases of camelids -- consulted electronically -- on whether or not prion diseases in dromedary camels should be considered as emerging diseases according the definition of the Terrestrial Code.

"The Scientific Commission highlighted that camel prion disease should be considered a new disease and should not be overlooked. However, it noted that the scientific literature available described the event in only one country and that the evidence was not sufficient to measure the impact of the disease on animal or public health.

"The Scientific Commission encouraged the Camel Middle East Network (CAMENET) to lead the investigation of this disease with the support of the OIE Regional Representation for the Middle East and Sub-Regional Representation for North Africa.

"The Scientific Commission would reassess whether this disease should be considered an emerging disease based on the criteria listed in the Terrestrial Code when new scientific evidence becomes available." (page 38 in the final report, at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/About_us/docs/pdf/Session/2019/A_FR_2019.pdf).

The current information from Tunis warrants official notification of the Tunisian case(s), in particular since animal prion diseases such as BSE have been found, in the past, to have serious public health ramifications.

ProMED-mail will appreciate any additional information from Tunisia, including details on the location(s), animals affected (age, husbandry, feeding), and clinical signs, if seen. It would be interesting to note if the affected camels were born in Tunisia or otherwise.
