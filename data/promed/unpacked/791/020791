Local health officials say they are seeing nearly 5 times more confirmed flu cases than this time last year [2013] and it's affecting attendance in CCISD [Corpus Christi Independent School District, Nueces County, Texas, USA].

Debra Gilchrist is the Director for Student Health Services for CCISD and says she's been noticing a drop in attendance and when she started asking around, nurses said it was because of the flu. She said area schools are claiming they have anywhere from 2 to 10 confirmed cases of the flu [influenza virus infection].

Health officials recommend getting flu shots and practicing healthy habits like washing your hands, sneezing into your elbow instead of your hand, and eating right. Debra also recommends that parents keep their kids home if they are still showing symptoms like fever.

[In the most recent global influenza update, dated 3 Nov 2014, it was reported that globally, influenza activity was low, with the exception of some Pacific islands. In North America, influenza activity began to increase slightly but remained low. In Europe, overall influenza activity remained at inter-seasonal levels. Furthermore, in tropical countries of the Americas, influenza detections decreased with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causing most influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) [http://www.who.int/influenza/surveillance_monitoring/updates/2014_11_03_surveillance_update_223.pdf?ua=1].

The outbreak among children at schools in Corpus Christi, Texas, may be forewarning of the onset of the seasonal northern hemisphere epidemic in North America, or merely a statistical anomaly. Information on the identity of the strains of influenza virus(es) isolated in Corpus Christi schools would be welcomed. - Mod.CP
