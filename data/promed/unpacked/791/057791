A total of 160 sheep have been slaughtered after foot-and-mouth antibodies
were discovered in one of them. Officials are testing 10 000 sheep on the
Brecon Beacons after a cluster of confirmed cases in nearby Libanus.
Antibodies were found in one sheep, and all animals contained in the same
pen have now been destroyed. An Assembly spokesman said: "We are not
counting this as a confirmed case. The antibodies just show this animal
has been in contact with the disease. This is not completely unexpected."
The number of confirmed cases in Wales is unchanged at 97.
