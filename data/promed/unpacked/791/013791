While there have been Ebola awareness campaigns in the region of Tanzania bordering the South Kivu and the Tanganyika provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), this report from the Congolese Radio Okapi does not refer to a location in Tanzania. Kongolo is a town in the province of Tanganyika in the DRC. The radio news has nothing to do with suspected cases in Tanzania or the response of the Tanzanian government.

[ProMED-mail regrets the error and is grateful to the 2 submitters who picked it up and submitted the corrections above. From 1961-1964, Tanganyika was a sovereign state, comprising the mainland part of present-day Tanzania. The country officially joined with the People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba to form the United Republic of Tanganyika and Zanzibar on 26 Apr 1964. The new state changed its name to the United Republic of Tanzania within a year (from Wikipedia). As noted in the corrections, Tanganyika referred to in the post is the province of Tanganyika in the DRC. - Mod.LK
