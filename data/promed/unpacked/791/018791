Commerce and Employment issues statement on Jersey bee disease outbreak
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
There has been an outbreak of American Foul Brood [AFB] disease in
Jersey [Channel Islands]. The disease has been confirmed in 2 colonies
of bees and it is understood that there is a 3rd suspected outbreak of
disease in another colony.

American Foul Brood disease affects the larval stage of honey bees. It
is caused by a bacterium called _Paenibacillus larvae_ that infects
and kills larvae and can produce over 1 billion spores from each
infected larvae. These spores are extremely resistant to heat and
chemical disinfectants and can survive for many years in bee hives and
equipment.

The disease is a Notifiable Disease in Guernsey [Channel Islands] and
so bee-keepers should inspect their hives and must report any
suspected cases to the Commerce and Employment Department.

Combs of infected colonies have a mottled appearance due to a mixture
of healthy capped brood, uncapped cells containing the remains of
diseased larvae and empty cells. Mr Alf Salmon, who has acted as a bee
inspector in Guernsey, on behalf of the Guernsey Beekeepers
Association, tells me that there is a very nasty characteristic smell
of fish in infected hives.

Infection could be brought into the island by bee-keepers moving
infected hives and equipment into the island and it can even be picked
up from contaminated imported honey! I understand that the last
outbreak of American Foul Brood in Guernsey was about 40 years ago and
was caused by a tin of Brazilian Honey that was put out for local bees
to clean up!

Guernsey beekeepers are advised that it is illegal to import used bee
hives and 2nd-hand equipment. They should only import new bee hives
and equipment so as to keep disease out of the island and all imports
of colonies are strictly controlled.

Although people can import nuclear bee stock into the island, this is
discouraged. The Guernsey bee population has remained relatively
disease free but is always at risk from unscrupulous people importing
used equipment or bee colonies into the island. There have been
rumours recently that bees and possibly some equipment has been
imported into the island as beekeeping has become much more popular.

It is known that there is a ban on any movements of bee stocks or
equipment in Jersey and there is also a ban on export as well. We
understand that a register is being compiled of all beekeepers in
Jersey and that a professional team of bee inspectors from England
will be arriving this week to carry out an inspection of all stocks in
the island. Any colonies and equipment that is found to be diseased
will be destroyed and burnt.

Beekeepers in Guernsey (and in Sark, Alderney and Herm [Channel
Islands]) are advised to be very vigilant and to carry out a routine
inspection of all their hives as soon as possible to ensure that they
remain free of disease.

Advice can be obtained from the Guernsey Beekeepers Association. If a
beekeeper suspects that one of his colonies is infected then he should
seek advice from the Guernsey Beekeepers Association bee inspector and
inform the Commerce and Employment Department without delay.

The best way to ensure that American Foul Brood disease does not
infect bee colonies in Guernsey is to follow the golden rules:

1. Do not import any bee colonies into Guernsey.
2. Do not import any used beehives or bee equipment into Guernsey.
3. Do clean and wash out all empty jars of honey before disposal.
