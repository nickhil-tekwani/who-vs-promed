Man dies from flesh-eating bacterium found in local waterways
-------------------------------------------------------------
A 75-year-old Hanover [Virginia] man died recently after developing a flesh-eating bacterial infection from the Rappahannock River. According to WTVR, the man stepped on something in the river. When the wound became infected, his leg had to be amputated and he died shortly afterwards.

The Virginia Department of Health says a bacterium called _Vibrio vulnificus_ was in the water and contributed to the death. The death was the 1st in Virginia in 2015 attributed to _Vibrio_. There have been 17 cases reported so far in 2015.

While the risk is low, an owner of a Newport News seafood company tells NewsChannel 3, he takes precaution everyday, especially when it comes to his seafood and his staff. "I supply ice for them and I make sure the oysters are iced down when I take them out. I check their temperature when they get to the dock," says Kent Carr, owner of Kent Carr Seafood. "If they've got scratches or sores or any of that, you can't let them work, and I'm really particular about that."

The bacterium is naturally found in brackish and salt waters and thrives when the water is warmer. This includes the James River, Elizabeth River and Chesapeake Bay. Infections can occur in people who eat raw or undercooked shellfish or who swim with open wounds or punctures in the contaminated waters. Carr says people should be aware, but not scared about it.

The risk of infection is low and because it naturally occurs, health officials generally do not test for it.

[The following is extracted from the "Bad Bug Book," Center for Safety and Applied Nutrition, US FDA (Food and Drug Administration) at http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/UCM297627.pdf#page46:

_Vibrio vulnificus_, a lactose-fermenting, halophilic, Gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen, is found in estuarine environments and associated with various marine species such as plankton, shellfish (oysters, clams, and crabs), and finfish. Environmental factors responsible for controlling numbers of _V. vulnificus_ in seafood and in the environment include temperature, pH, salinity, and amounts of dissolved organics. It may be normal flora in salt water, and acquiring this organism from shellfish or water exposure does not imply that the water is contaminated by sewage.

Wound infections result either from contaminating an open wound with sea water harboring the organism, or by lacerating part of the body on coral, fish, etc., followed by contamination with the organism. The ingestion of _V. vulnificus_ by healthy individuals can result in gastroenteritis.

The "primary septicemia" form of the disease follows consumption of raw seafood containing the organism by individuals with underlying chronic disease, particularly liver disease. The organism can also enter through damaged skin. In these individuals, the microorganism enters the blood stream, resulting in septic shock, rapidly followed by death in many cases (about 50 percent). Over 70 percent of infected individuals have distinctive bullous skin lesions (shown at http://safeoysters.org/medical/diagnosis.html).

There are 2 points to be emphasized: that vibrios are normal flora in warm saltwater (not indicative of any sewage contamination) and that most of the life-threatening illnesses occur in individuals with underlying medical illnesses, including immunocompromised states, chronic liver disease, and diabetes. So-called normal individuals often just get gastroenteritis. The range of disease due to _V. vulnificus_ can involve more northern geographical areas if the area is affected by a substantial heat wave. - Mod.LL
