The UK, the USA and Canada are facing growing fears over a
drug-resistant bacterium being brought back by wounded soldiers from
Afghanistan and Iraq that threatens to contaminate civilian hospitals.

The intensified concern comes amid sharply rising infection rates in
the US and fresh worries in Canada that the bug could be imported
into its civilian healthcare system. Military health officials who
have studied the bacterium in Afghanistan believe the infection of
wounded British soldiers in field hospitals there is probably
inevitable.

The US military originally thought the bug came from contaminated
Iraqi soil, but troops in Afghanistan have also been infected.
Canada's public health service last week revealed it had ordered the
screening of all its wounded soldiers being repatriated from
Afghanistan.

The bacterium, _Acinetobacter baumannii_, 1st emerged as an infection
afflicting USA service personnel returning from the war in Iraq in
2003-04. It was described by a scientific journal specializing in
hospital epidemiology as the "most important emerging
hospital-acquired pathogen worldwide." The journal added that it was
potentially a major threat to public health due to its ability to
mutate rapidly and develop a resistance to all known drugs.

Although different types of _Acinetobacter_ have been known for
decades in hospitals, the new T strain identified in the injured
troops is particularly virulent and has been observed to appear in
USA servicemen within 2 hours of being admitted to a field hospital.
Equally worrying is its resilience, as it can be extremely difficult
to eliminate from medical facilities once established.

Although the Ministry of Defence tried to play down fears of the
infection when the 1st suspected British cases were reported in 2006
in the Lancet, its increasingly rampant progress through America's
military hospital system has been causing intense alarm elsewhere.

Canadian military doctors investigated the infection in Canadian
troops at an intensive care unit in Kandahar and published a report
in the journal BMC Infectious Diseases earlier in 2007. The officers
warned that their findings about the infection risk were "equally
applicable to US and British military field hospitals as well,"
adding that "the environmental and logistical problems that faced
[the medical units involved] are common across field hospitals in
Afghanistan and Iraq." They added that "unrestricted use of
antibiotics" at the field hospitals to compensate for poor
environmental conditions had contributed to the emergence of the new
strain.

In addition to a new screening regime, Canadian infectious disease
officials will meet early next year [2008] to develop a national
strategy to deal with the risk of the new strain spreading to
civilian hospitals. One of the report's authors, Major Homer Tien,
told The Observer from Kandahar yesterday [15 Dec 2007] that further
outbreaks appeared inevitable. Concern is all the higher because, as
in the UK, injured Canadian troops are treated in the civilian
healthcare system, while most Americans are treated in an extensive
network of military hospitals.

Infection rates have risen steeply in the USA. In 2001 and 2002,
around 2 percent of admissions were infected at a specialist army
burns unit in Texas. By 2003, the rate had risen to 6 percent, then
12 percent by 2005, a rate consistent with other facilities. So far,
27 servicemen have died from the infection.

In stark contrast to Canada and the USA, the attitude towards the
threat in the UK has been sanguine and low-key. An MoD spokesmen last
week insisted there had not been a case since November 2004 and that
it employed "robust and stringent infection control procedures which
fully meet NHS requirements adequate to deal with the problem."

et al: Multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter infections in critically
injured Canadian forces soldiers. BMC Infectious Diseases 2007,7:95.

A recent publication from the USA military (1) reported that only one
in 160 patients screened (0.6 percent) was found to have _A.
baumannii_ on their skin and only one of 49 (2 percent) soil samples
were positive, but the organism was recovered from treatment care
areas in 7 of the 7 field hospitals sampled. Their results suggest
that environmental contamination of field hospitals and infection
transmission within the healthcare facilities played a major role in
the outbreaks of this organism. Indeed, one of the 5 cluster groups
with _Acinetobacter_ infection involved hospitalized individuals who
had not been deployed to Iraq. Be that as it may, in a recently
published surgical study (2), _Acinetobacter_ species were the most
commonly isolated organism from trauma-related infections in
battlefield casualties from Iraq. Of note, one of the authors, Kyle
Petersen, of the 1st paper and 1st author of the 2nd one submitted
ProMED's initial posting on this topic.

Community-acquired _Acinetobacter_ infections do occur. As an
example, Anstey and colleagues reported 11 cases of bacteremic,
community-acquired _A. baumanii_ pneumonias from the Northern
Territory of Australia and reviewed 34 others (3). Cigarette smoking,
alcoholism, chronic lung disease, and diabetes were risk factors. The
scenario has also been described in Papua New Guinea (5) and other
parts of Asia including Taiwan and Malaysia, as well as more
developed countries such as the USA (4) and France (6).

_Acinetobacter_ infections of wartime injuries have been recognized
for a time much longer than this current conflict; Myron Tong
reported that _Mimeae-Herellea_ (organisms of which some were renamed
_Acinetobacter_) were the most common Gram-negative bacilli isolated
from wounds on day one of hospitalization in the Viet Nam conflict
(7). Additionally, Aarabi (8) found that _Acinetobacter_ was the 2nd
most common cause of infection of missile-related head wounds in an
Iranian report from data collected during the Iran-Iraq conflict.
