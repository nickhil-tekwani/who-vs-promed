The public, especially paddy farmers, were yesterday [20 Sep 2008]
warned to be extra vigilant when attending to their work in paddy
fields, as leptospirosis, widely known as the dreaded rat fever, was
fast developing into an epidemic, with 33 deaths reported in the last 3 weeks.

Government Epidemiology Unit Chief Dr. Praba Palihawadana said the
deadly disease was on the fast track, with the number of patients and
deaths having increased rapidly in September 2008. "The number of
leptospirosis cases reported up to the end of August 2008 was 3825,
with only 117 deaths. But the number of patients reported mainly from
paddy farming districts increased to 4500 by yesterday [20 Sep 2008],
with deaths increasing to 150 during this period. The reported number
of 33 deaths in 20 days is a serious matter," she said.

Dr. Palihawadana said the largest number of cases were reported from
paddy farming areas, while a significant increase in new cases had
been reported from the districts of Colombo, Gampaha Kalutara,
Matale, Kandy, Kurunegala, Matara, Kegalle and Kurunegala.

"The danger is that people could be infected not only through water
contaminated by rat urine but also from water contaminated by the
urine of infected cattle, goats, dogs and cats, which act as carriers
of the dreadful disease," Dr. Palihawadana stressed.

Dr. Palihawadana advised farmers in affected districts to [weekly]
take 2 doxycycline tablets, which is useful as a [prophylactic]
antibiotic for leptospirosis, before they started work.

[In the prior ProMED-mail posting on leptospirosis in Sri Lanka (see
Leptospirosis - Sri Lanka (04) 20080909.2810) there had been 118
deaths and 3960 cases reported during the period 1 Jan 2008 through
the end of August 2008 (compared with 34 deaths and 2195 cases
reported in 2007). In the above newswire there are reports of an
additional 33 deaths and 675 cases reported since the end of August
2008 - a significant increase -- suggesting that this year's rainy
season probably resulted in more areas with local flooding of the
paddy areas of the country. - Mod.MPP]
