Leading veterinary experts of 28 countries call for more vigorous bird flu
control
-----------------------------------------------
An international conference on avian influenza in Asia has expressed major
concern about the bird flu situation in the region. Chief veterinary
officers from 28 countries called upon governments in the region and the
international community to make the fight against the lethal virus a top
priority and to commit more financial resources to national and regional
anti-bird flu campaigns.
The 3 day conference ended today [25 Feb 2005]. It was jointly organized by
the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation
for Animal Health (OIE), in collaboration with the World Health
Organization (WHO). Animal and human health experts agreed that, one year
after the bird flu crisis, progress has been made in the early detection of
and rapid response to the disease. There are fewer outbreaks in the region
today than were recorded one year ago. But the virus is still circulating
among poultry, ducks and wildlife in the region and continues to pose a
serious threat to human health and animals. More funds and more vigorous
bird flu control campaigns in affected countries could help to control the
disease in birds and thus avoid the risk of a global avian influenza
pandemic in humans. Countries hit by the virus should take a more proactive
approach to combat the disease at its origin. Funding for this approach is
considered essential.
The virus circulation in poultry producing rural and urban areas and market
places requires more attention, according to conference participants. As
long as the virus continues to circulate among animals, it will remain a
threat to humans. Massive public awareness campaigns should sensitize
poultry producers and consumers throughout the food chain about bird flu
related risks. Farmers and veterinarians should become the main allies in
detecting the virus at the earliest stage possible to trigger immediate
control interventions.
The conference also recognized the link between farming systems and the
spread of the virus, especially the proximity between farmed chickens and
ducks in many backyard households contributing to the circulation of the
disease. In addition, the movement and marketing of live animals, not
controlled by veterinarians, are a major cause for spreading the disease.
The conference recommended several strategies to minimize the risk of virus
transmission between species and to, therefore, protect humans. These
include segregation in farm settings of chickens, ducks, and other animals,
such as pigs, and a reduction in contact between these animals and humans.
Delegates called upon the global community to help with the financing of
these costly but vital changes. More than USD 100 million would be needed
to urgently strengthen animal health services and laboratories to improve
virus detection and its ultimate eradication. Several hundred million
dollars would be required to finance the restocking of infected poultry
flocks and to restructure the whole sector. Bird flu control campaigns
(virus detection, culling, biosecurity and vaccination) should respect
social, economic and cultural conditions in each affected country.
The meeting agreed that vaccines can be a strong weapon in the fight
against the disease in poultry. The possibility of vaccinating ducks should
be explored. But the conference acknowledged the need to further study
conditions in which vaccines can be delivered with minimum risk to human
health.
The bird flu virus does not respect borders and needs a strong regional
response. Existing regional cooperation networks recently established by
FAO should be extended. Without proper funding, these networks will cease
their activities within the next 6 months. Countries are urged to report
occurrences of the disease to the OIE in a timely and transparent manner.
They should also share information on disease outbreaks and campaigns with
neighboring countries.
There are between 25 and 40 million village backyard poultry farmers in
Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao, Thailand and Viet Nam. The majority of poor
farmers keep poultry for income and food security.

Experts pinpoint ducks' role in bird flu
----------------------------------------
Health and animal experts said on Thursday [24 Feb 2005] that any long term
strategy for controlling bird flu must address the role of ducks and other
waterfowl as major culprits in the spread of the deadly virus. At an
international conference in Ho Chi Minh City this week [4th week February
2005], officials said that extensive research since the 1st major outbreak
last year has confirmed that wild birds, particularly ducks, are primary
reservoirs for the H5N1 virus, since they can carry it without falling ill.
"The fact that they accept ducks as a key player is a step forward", said
Dr Robert Webster, a virologist at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in
Memphis, Tennessee, who has done extensive research on influenza viruses.
"It's a very serious situation." Webster said in an interview that the
approach taken by Thailand to minimize infection risks by inoculating
free-range poultry and waterfowl should be taken as one model. "That is
going to be the strategy, to reduce the virus load in ducks, fighting
cocks, etc., so the risk of transmission to people is lowered," he said.
Earlier this week, Thailand approved a program to vaccinate free-range
chickens, ducks, fighting cocks and tropical birds in a bid to ward off
bird flu, reversing an earlier ban on the practice. But it is virtually
impossible to fully eliminate the virus from the environment, because it
can stay hidden in ducks, health experts say.
At the conference, Shigeru Omi, the Western Pacific regional director for
the World Health Organization, said the public health implications of ducks
as carriers are enormous. "How can people avoid exposure to the virus when
they don't know which ducks are infected and which ones are not?" he said.
Complicating the issue are traditional methods of farming in Asia that
allow free-range ducks, who roam from paddy to paddy, to mix with chickens
and other livestock. In host country Viet Nam, for example, there are an
estimated 59 million ducks, geese and other waterfowl, most raised in
open-air backyard farms, according to agriculture figures. Viet Nam has
banned the breeding of ducks until 30 Jun 2005. Ho Chi Minh City has
ordered a cull of all ducks this month [February 2005].
Not all experts agree, however, that wild birds alone are responsible for
dispersing the virus so widely. Evidence suggests that trade in live
poultry, mixing of bird species in farms and markets, and poor biosecurity
in poultry production play a much bigger role than wild bird movements,
said Dr Samuel Jutzi, with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. The
agency "advises against the destruction of wild birds and their habitats,"
since it is unlikely to have a major impact on controlling the bird flu, he
said.
Jutzi on Thursday [24 Feb 2005] urged the international community to spend
at least USD 100 million to combat bird flu, 5 times more than the
"glaringly insufficient" amount provided last year. Countries last year
[2004] gave only about USD 18 million to fund an emergency response to the
bird flu outbreak, he said, and spoke of "an alarming lack of commitment".
Experts have warned that the H5N1 virus, which has ravaged the region's
poultry industry and killed 45 people across Thailand, Viet Nam and
Cambodia, could well become even deadlier if the virus mutates into a form
that is easily transmitted between humans. So far, there is no evidence of
that, but health and animal experts say the longer it remains in the
environment, the greater the chances of the virus changing and triggering a
global pandemic that could kill millions.
