In some areas of Gomati and South Tripura districts, an unknown disease is spreading in the ripe paddy fields. Farmers lament that the growth of the paddy plants is being affected, and in some areas, the rice is not developing at the usual rate. Agriculture officials collected samples [to] ascertain the nature of the disease.

Tripura Agriculture Minister Pranajit Singha Roy paid a visit to some of the croplands, he said, "I have ordered my department to list in which areas these cases are emerging. As per our experts, this may be caused by faulty seeds, water scarcity, or over use of water or there may be an attack of insects. We will find out the problem and resolve the issue at the earliest."

[A range of pathogens including fungi, bacteria, viruses and nematodes have been reported to affect rice crops in the region. Retarded plant development, the only symptom described above, may also be due to environmental factors. Reliable diagnosis of the cause(s) and/or pathogen(s) associated with the problems is essential before any management strategies can be designed.
