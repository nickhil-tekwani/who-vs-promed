A government advisory committee on Wednesday [3 Nov 2021] recommended that all American adults younger than 60 be vaccinated against hepatitis B, because progress against the liver-damaging disease has stalled. The decision means that tens of millions of American adults, mostly between the ages of 30 and 59, would be advised to get shots. Hepatitis B vaccinations became standard for children in 1991, meaning most adults younger than 30 already are protected.

"We're losing ground. We cannot eliminate hepatitis B in the USA without a new approach," said Dr Mark Weng of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted unanimously to approve the recommendation Wednesday [3 Nov 2021] . CDC's director, Dr Rochelle Walensky, must sign off on it before it becomes public policy, but it is not clear when she will decide.

The virus is spread through contact with blood or other bodily fluids and many recent cases have been linked to the opioid epidemic. An estimated 1.9 million Americans are living with hepatitis B infections, although many may not experience liver damage and accompanying symptoms for many years. The government has set a goal of eliminating viral hepatitis as a threat by 2030.

Officials previously recommended shots only for adults who fall into 15 categories of risk, a list that includes prisoners, health care workers, international travelers, patients with diabetes and certain other conditions, and people who inject drugs or who have multiple sexual partners. Health officials estimate about 20 000 new infections occur each year. The rate has been generally flat, though it has been rising in Americans in their 40s and 50s, officials said. "The current risk-based strategy ... has taken public health as far as it can take us," said Dr Kevin Ault, a committee member who chairs a work group focused on hepatitis vaccines.

The shots are given in either 2 or 3 doses, spaced a month or more apart. CDC data suggests that only about 1/3 of the at-risk people with diabetes and chronic liver conditions have been vaccinated, and just 2/3 of eligible health care workers. Overall, about 30% of all adults are vaccinated.

The committee considered recommending the shots for all adults. But a slight majority of members voted to set a ceiling age of 59 on the recommendation, because it echoes the parameters of the previous recommendation for people with diabetes. They argued that many elderly people are not at risk for infection, and that money and resources spent on vaccinating the elderly would have diminishing returns on reducing infections.

Under existing policy, people 60 and older can get the shots if they wish.

[The CDC head, Dr Walensky, must sign off on the recommendation before it is formally adopted. Unlike hepatitis A (and nonzoonotic hepatitis E), hepatitis B (and C) can cause chronic hepatitis leading to cirrhosis and liver cancer. With an annual incidence of 0.9-1.1 cases of acute hepatitis B in the USA per 100 000 population (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/hbvfaq.htm#overview), there is no clear trend upwards. Over the same period, however, hepatitis A has increased starting in 2016 to now (in 2018 for which numbers are available) to more than 3 times the incidence of HBV (https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hav/havfaq.htm#general. This upswing has been driven by outbreaks in certain populations, notably homeless and illicit substance users and has leaked into other groups. It will be interesting to see if parallel suggestions might be forthcoming for adults and HAV vaccine. The recent cluster of HAV infection in restaurant patrons in Virginia with 50 cases and 3 deaths might precipitate some thought of this in some cohorts such as food handlers. - Mod.LL
