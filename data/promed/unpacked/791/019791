Headlines
- In Papua New Guinea, a 3rd case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) has been confirmed, from a newly-infected province (Enga Province). Emergency outbreak response is being enhanced and reviewed, including to potentially expand vaccination geographically.

Summary of new viruses this week:
- Papua New Guinea, 1 new case of cVDPV1;
[- Nigeria, 1 new cVDPV2 isolate in a community contact of previous case];
- Pakistan, 4 new wild poliovirus type 1-positive environmental samples.

Weekly country updates as of 7 Aug 2018:
Afghanistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The total number of cases for 2018 remains 10. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [22 Jun 2018], from Kunar Province.
- No new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week.
- Preparations for the August [2018] national immunization activity are ongoing.

Pakistan
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported this week.
- The total number of officially reported WPV1 cases in Pakistan in 2018 is 3.
- The latest case had onset of paralysis on 18 May [2018], from Dukki district, Balochistan Province.
- 4 new WPV1-positive environmental samples were reported in the past week from Punjab, Karachi, and Sindh, all collected in July [2018].

Nigeria
- No new cases of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) were reported in the past week. The most-recently detected WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [21 Aug 2016] from Borno state.
- One new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in community contact of an AFP case has been reported this week from Yobe State.
- The country continues to be affected in 2018 by 2 separate cVDPV2 outbreaks: the 1st centred in Jigawa State and the 2nd in Sokoto State.
- In response to cVDPV2 detection, the country continues to conduct additional acute flaccid paralysis surveillance-strengthening activities, including enhanced active surveillance visits and community sampling. The programme has also carried out an extensive search for type 2 containing vaccines (tOPV/mOPV2) in the areas surrounding where the virus was detected.
- The GPEI is working with regional and country counterparts and partners to support an outbreak response and plan the October [2018] sub-national immunization activity.
- At the same time, outbreak response to WPV1 is also continuing, including to continue to address surveillance and immunity gaps in parts of Borno.

Lake Chad Basin
- The detection of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) and circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) in Nigeria continue to pose a risk to the neighbouring countries of the Lake Chad basin.
- Emergency outbreak response efforts continue across the Lake Chad basin, together with activities to fill subnational surveillance gaps across the region.
- These include efforts to vaccinate children at markets, in internally displaced persons and refugee camps, and at international borders.
- Preparations continue for the cross-border synchronized immunization activity in October [2018].

Central Africa
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week from Mongala and Tanganika provinces. The total number of cases in 2018 remains 11.
- The country is affected by 3 separate strains of cVDPV2 in the provinces of Mongola, Maniema, and Haut Lomami/Tanganika/Haut Katanga/Ituri.
- In response to recent geographic spread of one of the strains, including to Ituri Province close to the border with Uganda, provincial governors on [26 Jul 2018] convened an urgent meeting and signed the Kinshasa Declaration for Polio Eradication.
- The high-level meeting was convened by the minister of health as well as the WHO director-general and the WHO regional director for Africa. Provincial governors committed to providing the necessary oversight, accountability, and resources needed to urgently improve the quality of the outbreak response being implemented across the country. Outbreak response since the cVDPV was 1st confirmed in 2017 has been marred by operational challenges, as too many children continue to remain un- or under-vaccinated. This level of oversight can help ensure that operational deficits are rapidly identified and addressed.
- The outbreak response is being conducted simultaneously to ongoing response to a confirmed Ebola outbreak affecting North Kivu Province, in the east of the country (close to provinces affected by cVDPV2). As in the past, the polio teams are coordinating closely with the broader humanitarian emergency network to ensure both outbreaks are addressed in a coordinated manner (as was the case during the recent Ebola outbreak in Equateur Province, which was successfully stopped).
- Partners of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative will continue to support authorities across the country to ensure that this new level of commitment rapidly translates into operational improvements on the ground.

Horn of Africa
- The Horn of Africa is currently affected by separate outbreaks of cVDPV2 and cVDPV3, reporting both cases and environmental positives.
- Somalia is reporting a total of 4 cases in 2018: 1 cVDPV2, 2 cVDPV3, and 1 cVDPV2&3 with date of onset of the most recent case on 23 May 2018.
- Outbreak response to both strains is currently being implemented in line with internationally agreed-upon guidelines. Large-scale supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) have been implemented in Banadir, Lower Shabelle and Middle Shabelle regions, and Somalia, with additional SIAs planned or carried out in the affected zones of the Horn of Africa. Special surveillance activities are being undertaken to determine the origin of the viral circulation.
- WHO and partners continue to support local public health authorities across the Horn of Africa in conducting field investigations and risk assessments.

Papua New Guinea
- One new case of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 1 (cVDPV1) was reported in the past week from Enga Province, with onset of paralysis on [2 Jul 2018]. This brings the total number of cases in the country to 3 (one from Enga and 2 from Morobe Province).
- Papua New Guinea officially launched the outbreak response campaign on [16 Jul 2018] in Morobe, Madang, and Eastern Highlands provinces. Three more campaigns are planned for late August, September, and October [2018].
- With confirmation of a case in Enga, the geographic extent of the outbreak response is currently being reviewed and will be expanded as necessary.
- Intensified surveillance measures to improve detection of acute flaccid paralysis and poliovirus are being implemented across the country, with on-the-ground training for provincial and district staff being provided by NDOH and WHO.

Middle East
- No new cases of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) were reported in the past week in Syria. The total number of officially reported cVDPV2 cases in Syria in 2017 remains 74. There are no cases reported in 2018. The most recent case (by date of onset) was reported in Boukamal district, with onset on [21 Sep 2017].

[In the past week there has been 1 new case of cVDPV1 in Papua New Guinea in a new province (see Poliomyelitis update (33): Papua New Guinea (EG) 20180806.5950667 for more details on this case); 1 new isolate of a cVDPV2 in a community contact in Yobe State, Nigeria; and 4 WPV1 isolates in environmental samples from Punjab Province, Sindh Province, and Karachi city (also located in Sindh province).

My interpretations haven't changed from previous comments: the vaccine virus is in competition with the WPV for which viruses are stumbling blocks to achieving polio eradication. The verdict isn't in as yet, but sticking my neck out on the chopping block, I suspect we are getting much closer to interrupting transmission of WPV1 in Pakistan and Afghanistan than we are in identifying all foci of cVDPV activity globally and interrupting the transmission of these viruses.

The last confirmed case of the disease [polio] occurred in 1987; for this reason, the Ministry of Health is investigating what is happening.

A 10 year old boy with acute flaccid paralysis [AFP] and suspected to have poliomyelitis is in a "critical situation", the vice minister of health policies of the Ministry of Health (Minsal), Eduardo Espinoza, said yesterday [Wed 8 Aug 2018] at a television interview. The case is under review by the health authorities because, in the past 31 years, there have not been any cases of polio reported in El Salvador.

The child is from the canton of Los Llanitos, from Ilobasco, in Cabanas, and is admitted in the Bloom Hospital since 28 Jun 2018. The patient was examined in this country; specimens taken were sent to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, [Georgia], USA.

Although the CDC reported the presence of a type 3 Sabin virus, this does not mean that this virus is necessarily the cause of the clinical picture presented by the child, because the child received the routine vaccinations.

For the health official, the spinal fluid analysis, the haematological laboratory analysis, the tests sent to the CDC of Atlanta, and the notification made by the International Regulation from Washington [presumably the IHR - international health regulations requiring reporting through PAHO] leads to the conclusion that "this should be treated as a Guillain Barre syndrome [GBS] with the coincidental presence. of poliovirus 3, but it is not the polio virus that has caused the disease in the child. That is completely clear," said Espinoza. In addition, there is a waiting period of 60 days, counting from when the child began his clinical illness, to be sure that it is not a polio case.

The official did not rule out that this could be a case of vaccine-associated [paralytic] poliomyelitis, because the child had contact with the attenuated virus type 3 [OPV3] found in the polio vaccine taken. "This child, who was vaccinated 6 years ago, may have ingested the vaccine virus, but the vaccine virus does not cause the disease, except in the very rarest of cases, approximately 1 in every 2 million children vaccinated. The vaccine virus may have some manifestations like polio, but it is mild. In this case, the analysis showed that there was contact with this vaccine virus that probably came from a child who was recently vaccinated."

The declarations of Espinoza coincide with those of the infectious disease doctor, Jorge Panameno, who explained the results express that the child had contact with the virus, but that "there is less risk that an epidemic occurs, unlike when there are wild viruses."

There are 2 categories of virus: the wild poliovirus [WPV], which circulates naturally, and a vaccine-originated virus, which is produced by the live attenuated viruses found in the doses taken.

According to WHO, the attenuated vaccine virus multiplies in the intestine for a limited time, generating the production of antibodies that confer immunity. The vaccine virus is also excreted in the stool. In areas with inadequate sanitation, the excreted vaccine virus can spread to the nearby community, and this can confer protection to other children through indirect immunization. While in rare cases, when the population is significantly under-immunized, the excreted vaccine virus can continue to circulate for a longer period; in even rarer cases, vaccine viruses can undergo genetic changes that confer the ability to produce paralysis.

Panameno explained that, in the case that the virus is vaccine-derived, 2 interpretations must be made. "The 1st interpretation is that vaccination levels are low, and proper vaccination coverage has not been maintained. The 2nd is the terrible conditions in which the population that suffers from these diseases lives."

For Panameno, typhoid fever, hepatitis A, and poliomyelitis are diseases that have fecal-oral transmission in common. "That means that the Salvadorian population is consuming water that is contaminated with human feces and probably also foods [are contaminated]." Panameno called on the parents of families to review their children's vaccination records, in addition to working towards prevention of diseases transmitted through the fecal-oral route through taking hygienic means.

[This is now the 2nd case of an AFP syndrome presenting in a child in the Americas region in whom an OPV3 virus has been isolated. In the 1st instance, the child was an unvaccinated child who resided in a remote indigenous community of Venezuela that recently had a vaccination campaign (see Poliomyelitis update (21): global (Pakistan, Venezuela) PAHO update 20180616.5858106, Poliomyelitis update (19): Venezuela, vaccine virus found, VAPP susp 20180609.5848416, and Poliomyelitis update (17): Venezuela, cases conf. global (Pakistan), RFI 20180607.5845259 for details). In this current incident, the child is a 10 year old with a history of having reportedly completed the full polio vaccination series, presenting with an apparent GBS clinical picture (acute onset of ascending paralysis and usually sensory deficit), in whom an OPV3 virus was isolated. Recognizing that vaccine-associated paralytic polio (VAPP) cases can be detrimental to a country's vaccination program, serving as fuel for anti-vaxxers in the communities, it is still hard to understand how the isolation of a vaccine virus in a case of an AFP presentation is categorically ruled out as not being related to the vaccine virus. To date, I have not heard of another etiology for the AFP presentation in the Venezuelan case, and more information is still pending on the current case in El Salvador.

Wondering if I am missing something here, I ran to the literature and found an excellent review article on VAPP cases (see ref 1 below), but, more importantly, found an MMWR article describing an imported case of VAPP in a returning tourist in 2005. In this article there was mention that "the isolation of Sabin-strain polioviruses types 2 and 3 from a stool specimen and absence of isolation or serologic evidence for infection with another agent known to cause polio-like symptoms (for example, West Nile virus or enterovirus 71) is consistent with VAPP. A panel of polio experts convened by CDC confirmed this case to be paralytic polio on the basis of standard clinical evidence, and the case was classified as imported VAPP with onset of illness within 30 days before entry into the United States, in accordance with CDC protocol."

Landaverde et al (ref 3) did a review of AFP cases reported in Latin America and the Caribbean: "Cases with an onset of paralysis occurring 4-40 days following OPV administration were defined as recipient VAPP (group A). .... potential recipient cases with viral isolation but with an unknown status of residual paralysis were also classified as recipient VAPP (group B). Cases with an unknown status or date of OPV receipt or with an onset of paralysis outside the 4-40-day interval were defined as nonrecipient VAPP (group C). The term 'nonrecipient VAPP' includes contact cases mentioned in other studies and potential recipient cases with unknown dates of OPV administration. Potential nonrecipient cases with viral isolation and with an unknown status of residual paralysis were added if they were diagnosed as VAPP in the field (group D)." In those individuals in group C they calculated a risk of 1 case per 13.84 million doses of vaccine administered (1 case per 11.63-17.09 million). So my question remains: Was an alternative explanation/diagnosis made for the child in Venezuela to rule out a diagnosis of VAPP, and, moving forward, will there be an alternative diagnosis made for the child in El Salvador to rule out this being a case of VAPP? And with the occurrence of 2 cases of an OPV3 virus identified in less than 3 months, should we be concerned about the lots of vaccine in use?

Furthermore, in these cases of isolation of OPV viruses in AFP cases, should further studies be done using mouse models testing the neurovirulence of the isolate as done by Thorley et al. in ref. 4?
