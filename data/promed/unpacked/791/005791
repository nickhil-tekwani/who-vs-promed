Dengue fever is a viral disease transmitted primarily by _Aedes aegypti_
mosquitoes. There are four antigenically [and genetically] distinct dengue
viruses [serotypes] (DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4). Infection with any
serotype may lead to an acute illness characterized by fever, headache,
bone and joint pain and, occasionally, rash and hemorrhagic manifestations.
Secondary infection with a different serotype can lead to a more serious
form of the disease (i.e., dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF]). Dengue
incidence has recently increased in the Caribbean and Central America,
including Cuba and the Bahamas, which are within 100 miles of Florida, and
might increase the likelihood of its future autochthonous transmission in
Florida. This report summarizes information about cases of imported dengue
detected as a result of a laboratory-based active surveillance program
implemented in Florida from April 1, 1997, through March 31, 1998.
[MMWR] Editorial Note: Local transmission of dengue was last documented in
Florida in 1934. Although no local transmission of dengue was detected in
Florida during this investigation, many southern states may be at risk for
transmission; transmission [of dengue viruses] has been detected in Texas.
Two mosquito vectors (_Aedes aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_) are widely
distributed in Florida, and many infected travelers return from areas where
dengue is endemic and the resident [Florida] population has essentially no
immunity to dengue viruses.
Autochthonous transmission may result from importation of viremic cases to
counties with _Ae. aegypti_ or _Ae. albopictus_. This possibility should
especially be considered if cases are reported from such localities over
several years and if case-patients from these localities report travel to a
country where dengue is endemic. Epidemiologic data from imported cases
should be shared on a timely basis with mosquito abatement programs to
ensure an entomologic evaluation and appropriate control response by the
locality where the case-patients reside. On the basis of the results of
this study, surveillance efforts should be concentrated in counties with
large populations and large numbers of international travelers and should
intensify during dengue season (i.e., July-November) in the Caribbean
because of the large number of case-patients who travel to this area.
The findings in this report indicate that dengue infections were imported
into Florida in 1997 and 1998 more frequently than expected, based on the
10-year mean of 1.3 cases per year. In this and previous investigations,
dengue has been underreported. Underreporting is common with passive
surveillance systems. Active surveillance for dengue requires that state
health departments educate the medical community and provide appropriate
diagnostic laboratory support. Surveillance efforts should be enhanced in
the high-risk areas identified in this study.
Other states should consider enhanced dengue surveillance in areas with
widespread mosquito vectors and large numbers of travelers returning from
areas with endemic dengue.
State laboratory capabilities were enhanced to include testing for
anti-dengue IgM antibodies. Acute and convalescent serum specimens were
tested for dengue antibodies using the hemagglutination-inhibition assay
and IgM antibody capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Specimens
[with] IgM antibodies were forwarded to the Dengue Branch, CDC, in San
Juan, Puerto Rico, for confirmation of serologic results, and acute phase
samples were forwarded to CDC for virus isolation or identification by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
During the 12 months of active surveillance, 83 suspected dengue cases were
investigated in Florida. Commercial clinical laboratories referred
specimens from 36 (43%) of these cases. The remaining specimens were
referred through county health departments, hospital laboratories,
infection-control practitioners, or directly from physicians. Recent dengue
infection was laboratory-diagnosed in 18 (22%) of these cases. Thirteen
(72%) of the 18 positive dengue specimens were referred to the study by
commercial laboratories. All four dengue serotypes were detected (by virus
isolation and/or identification by PCR) in five of the cases studied.
Dengue was ruled out as the etiologic agent in 24 (29%) cases. The
remaining 41 (49%) cases were indeterminate because of a lack of
convalescent serum samples.
The age of laboratory-confirmed case-patients ranged from 8 to 69 years
(median: 38 years), and 14 (78%) were male. Antibody titers were suggestive
of secondary dengue infection in 10 (56%) of the 18 cases. Two (11%)
appeared to be primary infections, and laboratory tests necessary to
determine infection status (primary versus secondary) were not available in
the other six cases. Hemorrhagic manifestations were reported in seven
(39%) of the laboratory-confirmed cases, one of which met the case criteria
for DHF.
All case-patients reported recent (i.e., within 10 days before onset of
illness) travel from countries with indigenous dengue transmission, and no
local transmission was detected in Florida. The origin of travel of
case-patients was Haiti (six), Puerto Rico (three), Colombia (two),
Venezuela (two), Barbados (one), Nicaragua (one), and Thailand (one). The
two other case-patients did not indicate a specific travel destination but
reportedly had visited countries where dengue occurs.

[This report was not clearly written. I hope my attempt to clarify it does
not make it more confusing. For one thing, the statement "All four dengue
serotypes were detected (by virus isolation and/or identification by PCR)
in five of the cases studied." likely does not mean indicate that five
different people were infected with all four dengue viruses but that among
five people, four dengue types were detected. Also, I do not believe the
word "autochthonous" is used correctly. Looks to me as though the plan to
eliminate dengue from the Western Hemisphere is not on track, less than a
week to go. - Mod.CHC]
