Death of Woman in Atlanta as a Result of West Nile virus infection
------------------------------------------------------------------
ATLANTA: A 71-year-old African-American woman from downtown Atlanta has
become the first casualty from West Nile virus in the U.S. this year. The
woman, who was not identified by state authorities, died on 11 Aug 2001
after being treated for 12 days in Grady Memorial Hospital for symptoms of
meningo-encephalitis, a potentially fatal swelling of the brain and its
surrounding membranes. Preliminary test results confirming the diagnosis
were received Friday morning from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said Dr. Adewale Troutman, director of the Fulton County
Department of Health and Wellness. The woman lived in Palmer House, an
Atlanta Housing Authority senior-citizens' residence on Techwood Drive near
Centennial Park, and had not travelled outside the state or country in the
past 30 days, Troutman said.
This is the first human case of West Nile virus infection in Georgia and the
first death of any human this year. In recent weeks, a 73-year-old man and a
64-year-old woman from north Florida, and a 73-year-old woman from Staten
Island, NY, have all been hospitalized with the disease, but none have died.
Nationwide, 9 people have died of West Nile infection since the Old World
pathogen appeared in New York City in August 1999.
This summer marked the first appearance of West Nile in the southeast, and
Georgia and Florida have been a hot spot ever since. So far, 39 birds and
one horse have been found to be infected in 17 Georgia counties, and 29 wild
birds, 21 horses, and 3 [sentinel chickens in Florida, where 29 counties
have been placed on medical alert.
Georgia has been on alert status since the first infected bird, a hawk, was
found in DeKalb County, leading to the increased vigilance for encephalitis
symptoms that caused the deceased woman to be diagnosed, Troutman said. Six
other patients with symptoms that could be due to West Nile virus remain
under observation awaiting test results, he said.
According to research published this month by the CDC, for every serious
case of West Nile infection, there are 30 cases in which people experience
only a mild flu-like illness, and an additional 110 cases in which people
are never aware that they have been infected at all.
