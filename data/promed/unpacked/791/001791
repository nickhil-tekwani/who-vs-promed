Angola: Marburg hemorrhagic fever outbreak - WHO update 6
-----------------------------------------------
As of Sat 2 Apr 2005, the Angolan Ministry of Health has reported 163 cases
of Marburg hemorrhagic fever. Of these, 150 have been fatal. Cases have
been identified in Uige, Luanda, Cabinda, Malange, and Kuanza Norte
provinces. Uige remains the epicenter of the outbreak. To date, all cases
detected in other provinces are thought to have originated in Uige.
5 mobile surveillance teams in Uige continue to investigate rumors and
search for additional cases. More than 100 contacts are being followed up.
WHO is working with the Ministry of Health to finalize a national plan of
action for control of the outbreak, including sustained technical and
operational support from WHO and international partners in GOARN. WHO
anticipates that implementation of this plan will require significant
assistance from the international community.
