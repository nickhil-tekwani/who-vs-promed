Finally, the Health Ministry of the province of Osorno ruled out the diagnosis of Q fever in the 28 year old veterinarian who remains seriously hospitalized at the Las Condes Clinic. After receiving the results of the study carried out by the Institute of Public Health, the provincial head of the Regional Ministerial Secretariat, Vania Rojas, confirmed that the patient had become infected with another bacterial zoonosis: psittacosis. "The result was negative for Q fever, however, this serological study tested positive for psittacosis, which is another zoonotic infection, so we are attentive to the evolution of this patient," explained the official.

The 28 year old works as a veterinarian at the dairy company "Manuka" , and was admitted to the emergency service of the Osorno Base Hospital with suspected pneumonia. Due to her serious condition, she had to be transferred to the Las Condes Clinic, in Santiago, where she has been placed in the intensive care unit and connected to mechanical ventilation. According to information from the Ministry of Health, "Psittacosis or ornithosis is a systemic bacterial infection caused by _Chlamydophila psittaci_ that often causes pneumonia."

[Psittacosis and Q fever are both zoonoses with sometimes similar febrile presentations but with different reservoirs. Because of a substantial past outbreak of Q fever in the dairy, _Coxiella burnettii_ was suspected.

Psittacosis, also known as ornithosis or parrot fever, is a human disease caused by the bacterium _Chlamydophila psittaci_. Classically associated with psittacine birds such as parakeets, parrots, and cockatiels, it may affect other avian species such as turkeys, ducks, pigeons, and pheasants. Human infection in general is caused by inhalation of dust containing the bacterium, which is shed in large amounts in the feces and secretions of the infected birds. Illegally imported decorative birds that have not been screened and/or treated, can be a significant source of the pathogen.

The respiratory infection, usually diagnosed serologically, can be fatal if untreated. Although most diagnosed cases have direct exposure to birds, the infection may be acquired indirectly through the aerosolization of infective material in the grass or ground such as when mowing a lawn. Because of such outbreaks, protective equipment may be recommended for individuals in areas frequented by free-ranging birds if contact with birds and their droppings is likely when performing outdoor activities such as lawn mowing.

People who are occupationally exposed to psittacosis include pet store workers, poultry farmers, poultry processing workers, and veterinarians. - Mod.LL]
