[1] Congo DR: end of outbreak declared

The Democratic Republic of Congo on Mon 3 May 2021 declared the end of an Ebola outbreak that infected 12 people in the eastern province of North Kivu and killed 6 of them. The outbreak was contained using Merck's (MRK.N) Ebola vaccine, which was given to more than 1600 of the patients' contacts and contacts of contacts, the aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), said.

The cases were genetically linked to the 2018-20 Ebola epidemic that killed more than 2200 people, the second highest toll recorded in the disease's history. The latest flare-up emerged on 3 Feb 2021 in the city of Butembo with the death of a woman whose husband had contracted the virus in the previous outbreak.

The virus can remain in certain body fluids, including semen, of a patient who has recovered from the disease, even if they no longer have symptoms of severe illness.

"I am pleased to solemnly declare the end of the 12th epidemic of Ebola virus disease in North Kivu Province," health minister Jean-Jacques Mbungani said in a statement. "Despite the security context and the COVID-19 pandemic, the rapidity and efficiency of the response put in place by the government and its partners made it possible to defeat this pandemic in less than 3 months," he said.

The response was often hampered by insecurity caused by armed groups, and social unrest limited the movement of health workers, the World Health Organization said in a statement. "Huge credit must be given to the local health workers and the national authorities for their prompt response, tenacity, experience and hard work that brought this outbreak under control," said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. "Although the outbreak has ended, we must stay alert for possible resurgence and, at the same time, use the growing expertise on emergency response to address other health threats the country faces."

[This rapid end to an outbreak that could have exploded into a much greater one without the vaccine and the rapid response is good news. But it is not a time to relax support for maintenance of a strong public health system, including training and infrastructure. COVID continues to be a problem, as do TB, malaria, and other endemic diseases. Intensive surveillance should continue as should communication and education regarding safe burial practices, handwashing, and vigilance for suspected symptoms. - Mod.LK]

[2] Research: Ebola life cycle
Date: Thu 29 Apr 2021

The way Ebola responds to human RNA may lead to a way to defeat it. A key protein produced by the Ebola virus transforms into different shapes depending on whether human genetic material is nearby, suggesting a potential target for drugs to fight the deadly pathogen.

Scientists identified certain sequences of messenger RNA -- single-stranded molecules that carry protein-building instructions -- that triggered the protein to change from a butterfly-like form into a ring. The team reported the findings on 13 Apr 2021 in Cell Reports [see below].

Ebola virus disease is rare but can lead to severe bleeding, organ failure and death. Only 2 treatments for Ebola have been granted approval by the US Food and Drug Administration, both in late 2020, although other potential treatments are in development; the agency approved the 1st vaccine against Ebola in late 2019. There are 2 ongoing Ebola outbreaks in Guinea and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

To make more copies of themselves, viruses must hijack the cellular machinery of their hosts. But for viruses that use RNA as their genetic material, this replication process is rife with errors.

The virus that causes Ebola is particularly incapable of proofreading to make sure its genetic material is copied correctly, says Erica Ollmann Saphire, a professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, in San Diego, and last author of the study. Most of the mutations this leads to are detrimental to the virus. So it's in the virus's interest to keep its genome small, leading to fewer opportunities for mistakes; the Ebola virus has just 7 genes. "They encode just a handful of tools, and so that's the central question: How do they do so much with so little?" Saphire said. "We know there are at least 70 different things that happen in the viral life cycle for Ebola."

The proteins these genes code for must be able to play multiple roles, behaving more like a Swiss Army knife than a Phillips-head screwdriver. One particular protein, known as VP40, has captivated Saphire and her team.

"What's really cool about this one is how it unfolds and refolds to be different shapes for different tools at different times," she said. She likens it to a piece of origami paper that can fold into a frog or a sailboat, or to a ball of yarn. "The information that's encoded in the polypeptide chain would be like yarn that could knit into a sweater for you to wear in the morning, and unknit and reknit into a parachute when you have to leap out of a plane, and then unknit and reknit into pajamas in the evening," Saphire said.

Previously, she and her colleagues found that VP40 can fold itself into several shapes. One is a 2-molecule, butterfly-shaped form, called a dimer, that helps build "the shell and shape of the virus", Saphire said. Inside infected cells, the protein can also build an 8-molecule, wreath-shaped form, called an octamer, that can bind to RNA. This shape has "some kind of controlling function on how the virus executes its life cycle inside the cell," Saphire said.

She and her colleagues wanted to know which bits of RNA the protein would affix to in mammalian cells. "What we were missing would be how and why it would change from one to the other," Saphire added. "As the protein was 1st born, did it irreversibly fall down one folding pathway and destiny or another?"

She and her team exposed VP40 to cultured human cells and found that it latched onto human rather than viral RNA. Next, the team presented the protein with thousands of different snippets of human genetic material and concluded that VP40's transformation is triggered by mRNA sequences rich in the building blocks guanine and adenine. Intriguingly, the sequences came from parts of the mRNA strands that didn't code for proteins; these untranslated regions help regulate how the instructions contained in the protein-coding parts of the mRNA are carried out. This indicated that VP40 didn't require a specific gene or protein to work its transformation. However, the team did notice that some sequences that were "particularly favored" by VP40 came from genes that code for proteins released in response to stress, including one called HSPA1B, said Hal Wasserman, a postdoctoral fellow at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and co-author of the study. "We theorize that Ebola infection causes the cell to produce a large amount of HSPA1B and similar proteins and that Ebola then takes advantage of the mRNA for its own purposes," Wasserman said.

The researchers observed that these mRNA sequences could trigger the butterfly form of VP40 to refold into the octamer wreath. "It was identical to the protein that was born as octamer," Saphire said. "So this protein is like multiple computer programs all at once, and by sensing the presence and absence of things in the infected cell environment, it knows which one of those programs it needs to execute."

To complete its life cycle, the Ebola virus relies on its ability to make VP40 play multiple roles. This indicates that a drug that targets VP40 could wreak havoc on Ebola by knocking out several essential functions at once. What's more, the virus may be unable to mutate and "escape" the drug because it can't tolerate much change to this crucial protein. "It tells you that that's a key molecule to attack, and it might help you home in on what the different sites are that you might use to attack it," Saphire said. "We'd like to next learn [more about] what the functions are that it achieves by transforming and what other viral proteins do this."

"Summary
The Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 forms distinct structures linked to distinct functions in the virus life cycle. Dimeric VP40 is a structural protein associated with virus assembly, while octameric, ring-shaped VP40 is associated with transcriptional control. In this study, we show that suitable nucleic acid is sufficient to trigger a dynamic transformation of VP40 dimer into the octameric ring. Deep sequencing reveals a binding preference of the VP40 ring for the 30 untranslated region of cellular mRNA and a guanine- and adenine-rich binding motif. Complementary analyses of the nucleic-acid-induced VP40 ring by native mass spectrometry, electron microscopy, and x-ray crystal structures at 1.8 and 1.4 A resolution reveal the stoichiometry of RNA binding, as well as an interface involving a key guanine nucleotide. The host factor-induced structural transformation of protein structure in response to specific RNA triggers in the Ebola virus life cycle presents unique opportunities for therapeutic inhibition.

"Highlights
- Ebola virus matrix protein VP40 can form a dimer or an RNA binding octameric ring.
- 30 UTRs of host mRNA are favored for ring binding, with G/Arich binding motifs.
- Small RNAs/DNAs with related motifs are sufficient to transform VP40 dimer to ring.
- This transformed ring has well-defined stoichiometry aligning with endogenous ring.

"We have shown that VP40 can transform from one structure to another and that host RNA may be both necessary and sufficient for the transformation of VP40 from its structural role to its essential non-structural role in the virus life cycle. This host-triggered structural transformation allows the Ebola virus gene products to carry out a greater number of functions in the virus life cycle than would otherwise be possible. The requirement to support structural transformation may limit mutational change in viral proteins such as VP40, reducing the danger of escape mutations and thus representing an Achilles' heel of the virus. Thus, as we increasingly understand VP40 and its structures supporting molecular transformation, this transformer protein may emerge as an important target for antiviral drug design." - Mod.LK
