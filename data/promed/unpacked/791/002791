As of 15 Mar 2010, 15 districts nationwide were affected with
cholera, with 663 cases confirmed since January 2010, according to a
Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation update. At least 15 deaths
have been recorded. Worst affected are parts of Coast, Eastern and
Rift Valley provinces. Kajiado District, in Rift Valley, has 177 cases.

In 2009, at least 781 cholera cases were laboratory confirmed with
274 deaths, in an outbreak attributed to widespread water shortages
because of drought, contaminated dry river beds and poor hygiene.

At present, more cholera deaths and cases are being reported in
remote areas. Suspected cholera deaths have been reported in the
northwestern Turkana Central District, the medical officer, Kilkrist
Lokoyer, told IRIN.

"We have sent a medical team from Lodwar [the main town] to Mugur
area where 5 people have reportedly died after vomiting and
diarrhoea. We will conduct an audit to ascertain if it is indeed
cholera that killed them," said Lokoyer. Mugur is an island in the
crocodile-infested Lake Turkana making it difficult to access, he said.

Some 127 cases of cholera have been recorded in the eastern district
of Tharaka since 7 Mar 2010, Justus Kitili, Tharaka medical officer,
told IRIN. A temporary outpatient treatment camp has been set up at
the worst-hit Makutano Police Post, with medical personnel from
surrounding areas mobilized to assist the sick. Other areas affected
include the villages of Ura Gate, Mauthuni, Gakauni and Gatithini.

The Mozambican Health Ministry regards the cholera situation as
"stationary" in the 5 northern and central provinces hit by the
disease in 2010. The Ministry's spokesperson, Leonardo Chavana, told
reporters on Thu 18 Mar 2010 that in the previous 24 hours several
new cases of the disease had been notified, but no deaths were reported.

In the central province of Zambezia there had been 12 new cases, in
Cabo Delgado 9 cases were reported, in Nampula 6 and in Sofala 5. In
the 6th province affected, Niassa, there were no new cases at all.

The worst hit province is Zambezia. Since 1 Jan 2010, there have been
1188 cases notified in Zambezia and 19 deaths. The figures for Cabo
Delgado are 679 cases and 7 deaths, and for Niassa 543 cases and 13
deaths. Sofala has reported 241 cases and 1 death, and Nampula 167
cases and 1 death.

So far no cases of cholera have been reported from the southern
provinces. But Chavana said that, because of the heavy rains in the
south over the past few days, the authorities are on the alert for
possible outbreaks.

[3] Cholera - Mozambique

<http://blog.taragana.com/health/2010/03/13/mozambique-sees-rising-deaths-in-cholera-outbreak-with-42-dead-and-more-than-2600-infected-20409/>

Mozambique's health ministry spokesman says the country's cholera
outbreak has now killed 42 people in the northern and central parts
of the southern African country. Leonardo Chavane says the disease is
spreading, with more than 2600 cases of people who have contracted
the contagious yet easily preventable infection in 2010.

He said that the situation remains worrying as some provinces hit by
cholera are now also affected by flooding, which is likely to spread
the disease further.

A total of 11 people have died of cholera in Zambia since the
outbreak of the disease at the onset of rainy season in late 2009.
The waterborne disease is endemic in the southern African state
during the wet and rainy season of October to March.

According to the Ministry of Health spokesperson Reuben Kamoto Mbewe,
there has also been an increase in cholera cases from 241 in February
2010 to 564 in March 2010. He said, however, that the Ministry of
Health has continued to monitor the situation from escalating and
that basic water and sanitation measures are being provided to
vulnerable communities nationwide.

The landslide affected area of Bududa District is on high alert for a
cholera outbreak, as the infection has already been confirmed in the
neighboring district of Manafwa, with further suspected infections in Butaleja.

"Several cases of cholera have been confirmed in Manafwa," said
Ministry of Health spokesman Paul Kagwa. "The Ministry of Health has
sent a team to assess the situation and determine an effective response."

Mr. John Bosco Isunju, a lecturer at the School of Public Health,
Makerere University, said the concentration of displaced people in
nearby villages and relief camps would increase the risk of cholera.

"Effort needs to be put on providing clean and treated water for
people to drink," Mr Kagwa said.

hours in the municipal hospital of Tombwa, southern Namibe province,
Dr. Tomas Dias told Angola Press.

According to the doctor, the districts of Rocha Magalhaes and Pinda
are the hardest hit by the disease due to shortages of potable water.
He added that the Namibe province health authority on Monday [1 Mar
2010] started a training action of emergency teams. Those teams were
to be sent to different places in the province to diffuse an
awareness campaign to prevent the disease. He added that following
the cholera outbreak the province is now under epidemiological surveillance.
