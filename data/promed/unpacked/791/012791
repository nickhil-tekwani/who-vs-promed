Viral hemorrhagic septicemia, UK
--------------------------------
Information received on (and dated) 31 Dec 2012 from Dr Nigel Gibbens, Chief Veterinary Officer, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, London, United Kingdom.

Summary
Report type: immediate notification (final report)
Start date: 13 Dec 2012
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 17 Dec 2012
Report date: 31 Dec 2012
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced), necropsy
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks
Summary of outbreaks
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Marine hatchery, Scotland
Date of start of the outbreak: 13 Dec 2012
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Water type: salt water
Population type: farmed
Production system: semi-closed
Affected animals:
Species small: Cuckoo Wrasse (_Labrus mixtus_)
Morbidity: 70.7 percent
Mortality: 23 percent
Susceptible: 14 144
Cases: 10 000
Deaths: 3226
Destroyed: 10 918
Affected population: animals affected are not only cuckoo wrasse (_Labrus mixtus_) but also ballan wrasse (_Labrus bergylta_), corkwing wrasse (_Symphodus melops_), goldsinny wrasse (_Ctenolabrus rupestris_), and rockcook (_Centrolabrus exoletus_). Disease occurring in a population of mixed wrasse species, transferred into aquaculture for the purpose of sea lice control in farmed Atlantic salmon populations. The outbreak occurred in a tank based facility being used to hold the wrasse prior to being distributed to Atlantic salmon farms.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Epidemiological comments: the investigation is ongoing.

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; movement control inside the country; tracing forward; tracing back; surveillance; official disposal of carcasses and byproducts; no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals.
Measures to be applied: disinfection of the affected premises.

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type: Marine Laboratory, Aberdeen (national laboratory)
Species: ballan wrasse (_Labrus bergylta_); corkwing wrasse (_Symphodus melops_); cuckoo wrasse (_Labrus mixtus_); goldsinny wrasse (_Ctenolabrus rupestris_); rockcook (_Centrolabrus exoletus_).
Tests: real Time PCR; histopathological examination; virus isolation. Test dates: 17-20 Dec 2012
Results: all positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-ups will be submitted.

[Viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS) is one of the most important viral diseases of salmonid fish in European aquaculture.

The causative agent of VHS is a negative-stranded RNA virus called Egtved virus or viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). The virus belongs to the family _Rhabdoviridae_ and is placed into the newly recognized _Novirhabdovirus_ genus.

The disease is characterized by destruction of the endothelial lining causing clinical signs such as hemorrhages in the meninges, serous surfaces, muscles, internal organs and in the eyes, exophthalmia, darkening of the body, and pale gills. Ascites can occasionally be observed. The affected fish are slow and lethargic. In chronic stages dark discoloration and abnormal swimming behavior may be observed.

Data from these surveys carried out by the project "Rhabdoviruses in wild marine fish in European coastal waters" revealed a significant reservoir of VHSV in at least 15 species in northern European waters.
