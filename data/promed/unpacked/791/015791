Cases of [hantavirus infection] 40 percent higher than in 2009
--------------------------------------------------------------
After 4 years during which it seemed that hanta [virus infections]
were controlled, based on the low number of cases, today the
situation has again become relevant [to public health]. To date,
there are 49 people infected with the disease [virus], "a figure
greater than what is expected for this period," according to the
Ministry of Health (MINSAL) epidemiological report. Of these, 17 died.

Given this, the authorities issued an alert to the assistance
network, "During the next months an expected seasonal increase will
begin for this disease. Because of this, the health teams must be
alert for early indications," the document stated.

The chief of Epidemiological Surveillance of MINSAL, Maritza Garcia,
explained that although the numbers are still lower than those
registered in an epidemic year (in 2001 there were 81 cases),
mortality is high and represents 35 percent of infections. This
increase [in the number of cases of hantavirus infection] is due to
an increase in the rodent population that transmits the disease
[virus] (the long-tailed pygmy rice rat [_Oligoryzomys
longicaudatus_]). "If this is a year of more rain, if the quila
plants [a perennial bamboo that grows in the humid temperate forests
of Chile and Argentina] are flowering more or if there is greater
availability of grain, on which the rodents feed, the disease spreads more.

She also added that when the disease [incidence] decreases, people
tend to relax their preventive measures, which also affects [the risk
of] infection.

The regions where the most cases have occurred are Biobio (14
[cases]) and Maule (9). In that respect, the Biobio health SEREMI
[Regional Ministerial Secretariat] epidemiologist, Cecilia Soto, said
that 93 percent of the infected individuals are males. "The
environmental conditions are by far an important factor, such as
firewood collection." Osvaldo Palma, of the Maule health SEREMI,
said, on the other hand, that despite "the earthquake, where many
families decided to remain living in their destroyed houses, this
year [2010] we have not had a substantial increase in cases."

[Cases of infection by a hantavirus continue and are increasing in
this region of central Chile. Although not stated, the hantavirus
involved in this and previous cases doubtless is Andes virus.
