Latest Anti-polio Drive Deemed A Failure
----------------------------------------
KARACHI: A WHO official has termed the recently concluded 4 rounds of
immunisation against polio as an "ultra failure" while pointing out poor
vaccination coverage such as 60 per cent in Central District and altogether
zero coverage in some parts of the interior of Sindh Province.
A review meeting regarding the National Immunisation Days (NIDs) was held
on Fri 13 Apr 2001 with Maj. Gen. (Ret'd) Ahsan Ahmed in the chair. Health
Secretary Khalid Latif Choudhary, Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI)
Director Dr. Shamsun-Nisa Ansari, the WHO representatives Dr Azmoudeh, and
Dr Asad Ali Abro also attended the meeting. Dr Azmoudeh informed the
meeting that a total of 9 confirmed polio cases had been reported from
Pakistan, including 5 cases from Sindh Province alone, by the end of the
first quarter of 2001. Last year 50 confirmed cases were reported in Sindh
only, he added.
Sources told The News that the WHO representative particularly [referred
to] uncovered areas in Sukkur, Ghotki, and Jacobabad during last 4 rounds
of NIDs. [The inability of the Minister to commend more than few of the
District Health Officers (DHOs) involved indicated that the situation in
Sindh was unsatisfactory].
Ahsan particularly instructed all the DHOs from all over the province to
keep a vigil over [their] EPI supervisors during routine immunisation and
national immunisation days. He asked the DHOs to concentrate on their
respective areas. Ahsan made it clear that each worker involved in the
immunisation programme must know about the area assigned to him besides
having a map all the time.
Ahsan also urged all health directors to keep a close liaison with DHOs,
who have been asked to do the same with supervisors to achieve the target
of virtually zero polio case level in Sindh by December 2001. He advised
the health managers to set up vaccination camps at bus stops and railway
stations so that workers could [enter] vehicles for administration of oral
polio vaccines to children.

[Pakistan, which reported 60 percent of all poliomyelitis cases in the World
Health Organization's (WHO) Eastern Mediterranean Region during 1999, has
made substantial progress towards eradication of the disease, and wild
poliovirus type 2 has not been isolated since April 1997. Sindh Province,
however, remains a black spot. The following comment is taken from a report
in the MMWR Weekly for 25 Aug 2000 / 49(33);758-762. "A meeting in Pakistan
of the Interagency Coordination Committee in Feb 2000, identified several
issues that may contribute to the large number of susceptible children not
being reached by routine vaccination coverage and supplemental campaigns in
Pakistan. Nomads, the economically disadvantaged, and displaced persons,
such as Afghan refugees, are particularly difficult to reach and are often
a source of new polio cases. Also, conflict in adjacent Afghanistan affects
eradication efforts in Pakistan. Tentative plans for 2001 include 3 rounds
of door-to-door vaccination starting in Jan 2001 followed by another 2
rounds in the fall. Increased cross-border coordination of vaccination
campaigns is planned and should provide improved coverage to mobile
populations. The Ministry of Health has set a goal to expand access to
vaccination services and to increase routine coverage to 80 percent by
2002, and
AFP surveillance data will be used to target areas inadequately covered by
mass campaigns. Thorough follow-up case investigations will be performed
and areas with multiple AFP cases, low vaccination coverage, or wild
poliovirus isolates will undergo additional vaccination rounds. With this
level of activity and intensification, the interruption of wild poliovirus
transmission appears feasible in Pakistan in 2001" - Mod.CP]
