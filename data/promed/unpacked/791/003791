Burkina Faso: yellow fever
--------------------------
On 3 Oct [2008], The Ministry of Health [MoH], Burkina Faso reported 2
laboratory confirmed cases of yellow fever [YF] in the health district of
Ouahigouya [Yatenga province], in the North region of the country, near the
border with Mali. Both cases were reported by the yellow fever surveillance
system and presented with symptoms of fever and jaundice.

The initial case was a 7 month old baby boy who recovered from the disease.
The 2nd case was a 6 year old boy who died 2 days later. Both cases were
not vaccinated against yellow fever [virus] and were 1st confirmed at the
National Laboratory of Muraz Center and reconfirmed at the WHO regional
laboratory for yellow fever at the Institut Pasteur of Dakar, Senegal.

The routine infant immunization in the health district of Ouahigouya
started in 2002 and the reported Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI)
coverage at the end of 2007 was 85.3 per cent. This health district was not
retained as a high priority epidemic risk during the consensus meeting for
the yellow fever risk assessment in 2007. Of the health districts in
Burkina Faso, 37 will benefit from a yellow fever preventive mass
vaccination campaign on 13 Nov 2008.

On the basis of the outbreak investigation, it was decided to carry out a
reactive mass vaccination campaign targeting 366 052 people in the health
district of Ouahigouya. In response to the outbreak, the MoH has made a
request for yellow fever vaccines for the preventive mass vaccination
campaign from the GAVI [Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization]
funded Global Emergency Stockpile for yellow fever vaccine, managed by the
International Coordinating Group on Vaccine Provision for Yellow Fever
Control (YF-ICG).

[YF virus transmission has been active in West Africa this year (2008).
Fortunately, most of these occurrences have been sporadic cases from sylvan
(jungle) or bridge (intermediate) transmission cycles, without large
outbreaks of urban transmission, although that risk is real. In August
2008, the Ministry of Health of neighboring Cote d'Ivoire declared a YF
outbreak in the capital, Abidjan, where there were 19 YF cases in the
May-August 2008 period (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20080814.2532).
