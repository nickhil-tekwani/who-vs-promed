Parents are being urged to get their children vaccinated as the number
of people infected by measles in Sussex continues to rise. There have
been 73 confirmed cases of the virus so far this year [2011], more
than 10 times the number for the whole of 2010.

Health bosses believe many people have caught the virus while visiting
countries which are experiencing a mass outbreak of the disease. The
Health Protection Agency is warning families planning to visit France,
Bulgaria and Italy during the summer holidays to make sure everyone is
protected.

It says there have been 16 cases of measles in Brighton and Hove, 40
in East Sussex and 17 in West Sussex. However, it is believed the
actual number could be even higher because not every case is sent for
testing. The people affected are scattered around the county, instead
of in clusters, which suggests the disease is becoming more
widespread. Brighton and Hove, which experienced an epidemic affecting
more than 100 people in 2009, has one of the lowest measles, mumps and
rubella [vaccine] take-up rates in the South East, although numbers
are rising.

Jennie Leleux, public health nurse and immunisation lead for NHS
Sussex, said: "It is vital that parents and young adults realise how
important it is to get immunised. Although MMR take up in Sussex has
improved over the last few years it is still not sufficient to prevent
outbreaks of measles. It is a serious illness, and in rare cases it
can be fatal. Whether you stay here in the UK or travel abroad,
children and young adults should make sure that they are fully
immunised."

The World Health Organisation says 95 percent of a population needs to
be vaccinated to be protected. About one in every 15 children with
measles will develop serious complications, which can include
diarrhoea, ear and chest infections, fits, infection of the brain and
brain damage.

At the end of July [2011], the press service of the Ministry of Health
of Ukraine reported 10 cases of measles in the village of Lutsk
[Lutsky region]. Of those, 7 were children under 14 years, one a
teenager, and 2 were adults.

To prevent the spread of measles, the 25 other children in the village
were vaccinated as a precautionary measure. In order to prevent
further spread of measles virus infection, the vaccination programme
of the West Ukraine oblast will be revised. According to doctors at
Lutsky Central Hospital, the typical serious complications of measles
in unvaccinated individuals are an inflammation of the lungs and
encephalitis. At the present time, more and more adults are succumbing
to this childhood illness.

In a measles outbreak in the Volynsk oblast in 2009, about 1000 people
were struck down by the disease. Measles infection is often
sufficiently serious to require rest and isolation, but complications
of the disease are rare -- generally affecting only one in several
thousand cases -- according to the chief pediatric infectious disease
specialist Sergei Kramarev of the Ministry of Health.

In Ukraine, a mass measles vaccination campaign was initiated in 2009
using a commercially produced vaccine funded by the international
community. But the quality of the vaccine was suspect following the
deaths of some adults in Krsnyarks, and the vaccine was withdrawn and
destroyed. As a consequence, more than half the population has
remained unvaccinated. A replacement vaccine will entail significant
additional expense and will not be available for more than a month.

Health authorities in the municipality of Amboim, Kwanza Sul province,
registered a reduction of 38 cases of measles in the 2nd quarter of
this year [2011], fruit of the vaccination campaigns held in the
district. The cases of measles, according to the supervisor of public
health and control of endemic diseases, J. Alfinete, decreased from 40
to only 2 cases. He said that 2 children are hospitalised with measles
and are receiving treatment at the municipal hospital of Amboim.
[Their condition is satisfactory].

A measles epidemic has killed 1145 children in the Democratic Republic
of Congo [Congo DR] since January 2011, the UN's Humanitarian Affairs
mission in Kinshasa said Monday [25 Jul 2011]. The epidemic "has
already affected 115 600 children and killed 1145" between January and
June 2011, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA) said in a statement.

This prompted the vaccination of 3.1 million children across 5
provinces, it added. The campaign swung into action in May 2011 after
the NGO Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) deplored "the lack of
reactivity" of organisations like the World Health Organisation to
what it termed an "uncontrollable" epidemic.

The Congo DR is also battling cholera and polio epidemics.

[According to a UN News Centre press release
(http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39149&Cr=&Cr1=): "A
UN-coordinated campaign has vaccinated 3.1 million children. The USD
1.9 million vaccination drive, which was launched on 10 May 2011,
targeted youngsters in the country's Katanga, Kasai Occidental,
Bas-Congo, Equateur, and Orientale provinces."

Fidele Sarasso, the UN's humanitarian coordinator in the Congo DR,
said in the statement: "We thank our partners and urge them to
continue supporting us, especially now that DRC is facing other
epidemics, including cholera in the west of the country." Some 5407
cases of measles were reported in Congo DR last year [2010], causing
82 deaths, compared to 899 cases, including 26 fatalities, in 2009.

The 37-day measles outbreak that spawned 14 confirmed cases across 2
northeast Indiana counties has officially ended, the Indiana State
Department of Health said. Noble County Public Health Nurse Cheryl
Munson said the outbreak would be considered over if no new cases had
been reported by Tue [26 Jul 2011]. Lab reports returned Friday [29
Jul 2011] confirmed her earlier prediction. According to Munson, the
testing consisted of analyzing 268 blood samples and 33 nasal
specimens. 14 returned positive, Munson said, but none were new
cases.

The outbreak "is officially over since no new cases have been reported
in the last 21 days," Munson said. The initial outbreak began 20 Jun
2011 and sparked 12 cases in Noble County and 2 cases in LaGrange
County. According to the Indiana Department of Health, the maximum
time it takes for an unvaccinated person to develop measles symptoms
is 21 days. Munson said her ending estimate was modeled after that
time frame, with the last reported exposure being 21 days prior to
Tuesday [26 Jul 2011].

The 1st case originated with an unvaccinated Noble County resident who
contracted the respiratory disease on an international trip in
mid-June 2011. The infected person had "close contact" with other
members of his community upon returning stateside, Indiana Health
Commissioner Gregory Larkin told The Journal Gazette last month [June
2011]. In response to the resident's interactions and the illness'
highly contagious nature, state health officials in late June 2011
warned that Allen, DeKalb, Elkhart, Kosciusko, LaGrange, Steuben and
Whitley counties could all be affected.

The state Department of Health is advising the public of potential
exposure to a case of measles in Berks, Bucks, Delaware and Lehigh
counties. This possible exposure is in direct link to the 11 Jul 2011
exposure previously reported at the Rite Aid Drug Store, 3145 Main St.
in Morgantown, Berks County. A person who has been diagnosed as
possibly having measles may have exposed other people to the disease
on the following dates at these locations and times:

- Berks County: BB's Grocery Outlet, 6180 Morgantown Road (Old MOM's
Mall) on Tue 19 Jul 2011, between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.; Chick-fil-A, 4675
Perkiomen Ave., Exeter Township on Thu 21 Jul 2011 from 6:30 p.m. to
11:45 p.m.
- Delaware County: Starbucks, 443 E. Baltimore Pike, Media on Fri 22
Jul 2011 from 7:15 a.m. to 11:45 a.m.
- Lehigh County: KNBT Bank, 73 Main St., Emmaus on Fri 22 Jul 2011
from 4:30 p.m. to 9 p.m.; Pennsylvania Liquor Store, 1325 Chestnut
St., Emmaus on Fri 22 Jul 2011 from 4:30 p.m. to 9 p.m.
- Bucks County: Hot Spot Restaurant, Old Dublin Pike, Doylestown on
Fri 22 Jul 2011 from 6 p.m. to closing.

Although most people in the United States are immune to measles,
either because they received the Measles Mumps Rubella (MMR) vaccine
in childhood or because they were exposed to measles prior to the use
of vaccines, the following groups of individuals are at risk of
becoming infected with measles if exposed: Infants less than one year
of age who are too young to have received the MMR vaccine; Persons who
were vaccinated with an inactivated vaccine, which was used from 1963
through 1967, and have not been revaccinated; Persons born after 1957
who have only received one dose of MMR vaccine; Those who refused
vaccination; Those from parts of the world where there is low
vaccination coverage or circulating measles.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health urges all residents to be
vaccinated against measles. The MMR vaccine is given to toddlers when
they are 12 to 15 months of age, and a 2nd dose is required for all
Pennsylvania school children. For people who can't receive the MMR
vaccine (pregnant women, infants under 6 months of age, persons with
compromised immune systems), or if it has been more than 3 days since
your exposure, a dose of immune globulin can provide protection up to
6 days after the date of exposure.

The Montgomery County Health Department issued an advisory that a
county resident who traveled to Nigeria in Africa has contracted a
case of measles. Several people who came in contact with the infected
individual are being evaluated.

"County investigators and staff from local health care facilities have
contacted a number of individuals who might have been exposed to
measles to assess each person's risk. While most of those exposed have
been found to be immune to the disease, some non-immune persons have
been asked to stay home until they are cleared of risk," a press
release from the Health Department read. "At this time, there is no
evidence that this case is related to the measles cluster in Berks
County."

The infected individual visited 3 locations in the county, and the
Health Department is warning area residents who may have been at those
locations at the same time to be aware of possible symptoms of
measles. "Because measles is spread by infected droplets during
sneezing or coughing, by contaminated objects, and by direct contact
with nasal or throat secretions of infected persons, exposures may
have occurred at these places," the Health Department said. "The
measles virus resides in the mucus in the nose and throat of infected
people. When they sneeze or cough, droplets spray into the air, and
the droplets remain active and contagious on infected surfaces for up
to 2 hours."

The infected individual visited the following locations at the
specified times:
- Victory Christian Fellowship at 2650 Audubon Road in Lower
Providence on 24 Jul 2011 from 12:30 p.m. to 3:30 p.m.
- Mercy Suburban Hospital Emergency Department on DeKalb Pike in East
Norriton between 10 p.m. 26 Jul 2011 and 5 a.m. 27 Jul 2011
- Whitemarsh Medical Services at 1107 Bethlehem Pike, Suite 210,
Flourtown, on 27 Jul 2011 between 3:50 p.m. and 6:10 p.m.

The Auckland Regional Public Health Service can confirm 76 confirmed
cases of measles in the Auckland region as of this morning [25 Jul
2011], 3 contacts are in quarantine. [Up from 72 on 18 Jul 2011. -
Mod.CP]

Five cases have required hospitalisation during this outbreak It
remains that most cases have occurred in West Auckland with some
spread to Central Auckland, North Shore, and Manukau. Auckland
Regional Public Health Service (ARPHS) Medical Officer of Health, Dr
Richard Hoskins says: "There is no treatment for measles; the only
thing that can stop you catching measles is to get immunised." He
reminds parents that it is never too late to catch up on immunisation.
If your child has missed out, please call your GP to receive free
immunisation.

"Almost all of the 76 confirmed cases have been found in un-immunised
people. To check on whether your child is up-to-date with their
immunisations, contact your GP. This information can also be found in
your Well Child Health Book, or if your child is under 7 years old,
you can check the National Immunisation Register by calling:
- Waitemata DHB NIR (09) 838 1852
- Auckland DHB NIR (09) 638 0393 or (09) 638 0394
- Counties Manukau DHB NIR 0800 454 375.

"We continue to remind parents to take care and help stop measles
spreading, especially during the school holidays. If your child is
unwell or you suspect your child has been exposed to measles and they
are not up to date with MMR immunisations, please refrain from sending
them to any scheduled group activities including community
gatherings.

Parents need to be aware of the risks of taking unimmunised children
into public places over the school holidays. There are 90 confirmed
measles cases in Auckland [compared with 76 on Mon 25 Jul 2011 -- see
preceding report. -- Mod.CP], and more are expected following the
results of laboratory tests. "It's showing no signs of coming under
control," says Dr Richard Hoskins, medical officer of health. "It's
continuing to spread. That number looks like it's going to get a lot
bigger."

Dr Hoskins says parents who have chosen not to immunise their children
need to ensure they are kept away from public places over the
holidays. "You need to be not exposing your kid to places where they
might pick up measles, not only to protect your child but to stop your
child from getting and spreading it."

A student from Wakaaranga School, Farm Cove, contracted the disease a
few weeks ago. The pupil was quarantined along with dozens of other
unimmunised children in the last week of term, as well as those who
could not produce an immunisation certificate. "So far, we haven't got
any cases that are linked back to the school or that kid," says Dr
Hoskins. "It's 3 weeks since then, so we would expect to have been
notified of any cases."

As of yesterday [27 Jul 2011], the total number of Aucklanders with
confirmed measles was 90, and 13 contacts were in quarantine. Possible
cases have been reported in other parts of the country, but none have
been proven. Dr Hoskins says people need to stay in quarantine for 14
days from the time they come in contact with an infectious person.
"The only way to prevent it if it's circulating in a community is to
be immune to it yourself. The best way to do that is to have
age-appropriate immunisation."

All measles outbreaks in the past few years can be traced to people
bringing the disease in from overseas. "I'm not talking about people
who are immigrating to New Zealand or tourists," says Dr Hoskins. "I'm
talking about New Zealanders who have gone overseas and brought it
back with them. I wouldn't be surprised to find families that have
travelled out of Auckland and developed measles have spread it to
other parts of New Zealand, or to other places."

http://nz.news.yahoo.com/a/-/top-stories/9934363/measles-outbreak-centred-on-te-awamutu-but-will-spread/


There is an outbreak of measles in the Waikato, which seems at this
stage to be centred on Te Awamutu and surrounding communities. It
appears to have started about a week ago. A number of young people
have become ill at a similar time; the source of their infection is at
this stage unknown, says Medical Officer of Health Dr Dell Hood.

They may already have infected other non-immune people, so more cases
are likely. The incubation period for measles is usually 10-12 days
but may be longer, she said. People with measles can spread it to
others from the beginning of their illness until 4 days after their
rash has appeared.

People who may have been in contact with measles will be protected if
they have had 2 doses of measles mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.
Check with your doctor or nurse if you are not sure if you or your
children are protected. Anyone in contact with a case who is not
immune or not immunised must stay away from work, school or preschool;
stay at home, and avoid visitors for 14 days to avoid spreading the
illness.

Anyone who thinks they or their child may have measles should call
their family doctor or Healthline for more advice. If visits to the
doctor or laboratory are needed, please call in advance so contact
with other people can be minimised. For more information, see:

[A Sun 31 Jul 2011 update from Radio new Zealand
(http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/regional/81327/more-measles-cases-expected
reports that the Waikato District Health Board (DHB) now reports that
9 of the 10 patients are students at Te Awamutu College. Only one had
to be admitted to hospital. The DHB says the students have been mixing
with other people in their school holidays, so it is likely there will
be more cases.

Te Awamutu College is a state co-educational secondary school, located
in the thriving rural town of Te Awamutu. Maps showing the location of
