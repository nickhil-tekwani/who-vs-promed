Highly pathogenic avian influenza in the Netherlands
(Follow-up report No. 2)
--------------------------
Information received on 10 Mar 2003 from Dr Frederik H. Pluimers, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Ministry of Agriculture, Nature Management and
Fisheries, The Hague:
End of previous report period: 5 Mar 2003 (see Disease Information, 16
[10], 60, dated 7 Mar 2003).
End of this report period: 10 Mar 2003.
New outbreaks:
Location / No. of outbreaks
Gelderland province / 21
Utrecht province / 4
Description of affected population in the new outbreaks: 17 flocks of layer
hens, 3 flocks of breeding hens, 2 flocks of broiler parents, 1 flock of
broilers (also present on this holding: 1 flock of layer hens), 1 flock of
turkeys, 1 flock of ducks, and 1 small backyard flock.
Total number of animals in the new outbreaks:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
avi / 586 368 / ... / 16 611 / 569 757 / 0
Diagnosis:
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: Central Institute for Animal
Disease Control (CIDC(1)), Lelystad.
B. Diagnostic tests used: virus isolation in embryonated fowl eggs.
C. Causal agent: highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H7.
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: the type of strain isolated on
one of the infected holdings and the fact that many of the holdings (20 in
total) had free-housing facilities strongly suggests introduction via
waterfowl.
B. Mode of spread: contiguous or possibly through indirect contact with
wildlife (waterfowl). Contiguous contact (spatial spread) is possible
between holdings that are located within an area of 1 km of an infected
flock. For 8 outbreaks, contiguous contact is the most likely route of
infection.
Control measures during reporting period:
- quarantine and movement control inside the country;
- stamping out;
- screening;
- zoning.
Poultry holdings surrounding the confirmed outbreaks in a one-kilometre
zone are being culled pre-emptively. The remaining poultry holdings within
a 3-kilometre zone around the confirmed outbreaks are being clinically
inspected and sampled to exclude the presence of avian influenza.
For the killing of the birds, several methods are currently in use:
- Gassing with CO2 or CO gas.
- Electrocution.
- Lethal injection (on smaller holdings).
The carcasses are removed from the site in sealed, leak-proof containers,
after which they are transported to the rendering plant for destruction by
incineration.
