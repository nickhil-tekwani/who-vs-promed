The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released today the
most complete estimate to date on the incidence of food-borne disease in
the United States. According to data published in the current issue of
CDC's Emerging Infectious Diseases, CDC's peer-reviewed journal that tracks
new and reemerging infectious diseases worldwide, diseases caused by food
may cause an estimated 325 000 serious illnesses resulting in
hospitalizations, 76 million cases of gastrointestinal illnesses, and 5000
deaths each year.
"While the U.S. food supply remains one of the safest in the world, these
new findings further support what we have said all along: the public health
burden of food-borne disease is substantial," said HHS Secretary Donna E.
Shalala. "Our investments in better tracking and surveillance systems have
resulted in more complete data to help us evaluate ongoing and future food
safety efforts. I urge Congress to help us continue to build upon our food
safety programs -- we need to maintain our aggressive efforts on food
safety, and we need to fully fund the President's food safety initiative."
The data being released today come from a variety of sources including new
and existing surveillance systems, death certificates and published studies
from academic institutions. According to CDC Director Dr. Jeffrey Koplan,
these are the most complete estimates ever calculated and should not be
compared to previous estimates since the estimates are a result of better
information and new analyses rather than changes in disease frequency over
time. These new estimates provide a snapshot of the problem and do not
measure trends and do not indicate that the problem is getting better or
worse. In addition, these new estimates include some diseases, such as
those caused by _E. coli_ O157:H7 and Norwalk-like viruses, that were not
included in some previous estimates, he noted.
"Accurate estimates of disease burden are the foundation of sound public
health policy," Dr. Koplan said. "We're extremely pleased to have a new
baseline to measure our future efforts to improve food safety. Updated
estimates of food-borne illness are needed to guide new prevention efforts
and assess the effectiveness of food safety measures." These measures used
1997 as a baseline --- before key food safety programs were implemented.
Although the U.S. food supply is among the safest in the world, the nation
increasingly faces new food safety challenges. Novel pathogens are
emerging, and familiar ones are growing resistant to treatment. Since 1942,
the number of known food-borne pathogens has increased more than five-fold.
American consumers eat out more and cook for themselves less. They also eat
more processed food than ever before, involving more people and more
preparation, thus increasing the chance for disease-producing food-handling
errors. In addition, the number of people most vulnerable to food-borne
disease continues to grow: baby boomers are aging thus increasing their
vulnerability to food-borne illness.
Since 1993, the Clinton Administration significantly has expanded food
safety programs, increasing consumer protections to ensure that the U.S.
food supply remains one of the safest in the world. Some improvements
include: new safety standards for meat, poultry and seafood products,
better surveillance for food-borne diseases through FoodNet, and a new
Early Warning System implemented to improve our detection of outbreaks. In
1998, CDC launched a collaborative interagency initiative called PulseNet
that uses DNA fingerprinting to better detect food-borne illness. Today,
any one of the more than 35 laboratories in CDC's PulseNet network can
fingerprint _E. coli_ in less than 24 hours whereas the process used to
take days or weeks.
