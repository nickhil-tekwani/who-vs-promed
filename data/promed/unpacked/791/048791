At least 118 people in Erevan, capital of Armenia have acquired dysentery.
84 of them were children. According to ArmInfo, it happened because of
water pipe damage.
Drinking water contamination has happened in the center of the city, but
the exact place of the accident has not been identified. According to the
chief physician of infectious diseases of Erevan, Mr Ara Asoyan, patients
are being admitted from 2 districts of the city -- Central and Abakirskiy.
The agency "Rosbalt" reports that the Ministry of Health of Armenia says
the number of new cases of dysentery is dropping every day.

Chairman of the government-affiliated Water Economy Department Gagik
Martirosian was the first senior official to comment on a pipe accident
late in October 2003 that is thought to have been caused by drainage waters
that leaked into the pipeline in the city's northern Arabkir community.
Speaking today to reporters, he said the drinking water in the district was
processed with antibacterial chemicals on 27 Oct 2003. Martirosian said
several theories about the possible source of contamination were being
investigated. One of these theories was that the source might have been a
pipeline running through a bulb plant [?] in the northern outskirts of
Yerevan, but Martirosian said that no such source has been discovered there
yet.
At this moment, according to Martirosian, the possible source of
contamination is thought to be the territory in Arzni, north of Yerevan,
where the drinking water is accumulated from springs. Specialized
laboratories are examining the area to draw their final conclusion, which
he said will be made in 2 days. He did not deny that one cause may have
been a break in the drainage system of Arzni poultry farm -- but not the
sole cause.
According to the latest data, the number of people admitted to hospital
with dysentery since the pipe accident has increased to 156: 75 per cent of
them are children, 4 of them are younger than 12 months.

[Dysentery generally implies shigellosis, but the reports do not identify
an etiologic agent. Shigellosis is a human disease only and spread by
fecally contaminated food and especially water or -- because of its low
infectious dose -- from person to person directly. Chronic carriers of the
organism can occur.
