VANCOMYCIN-RESISTANT ENTEROCOCCI - AUSTRALIA
********************************************

Excerpted from FSNET (D. Powell, Univ. Guelph):

According to the press, 30 vacomycin resistant enterococci (VRE) strains have
been isolated in 60 patients from 16 different hospitals around Australia.
The infection is reported to have contributed to the deaths of half a dozen
people, and Australian hospitals are set for a big surge in cases. According
to the story, ten months ago there were only eight cases in four hospitals and
before 1994 there were none. It has now been found in every capital city
except Adelaide and Hobart. The article cites Prof. Turnidge, director of
infectious diseases and microbiology at the Adelaide Women's and Children's
Hospital, as saying that it is difficult to attribute deaths to the organism
because most people infected were already extremely ill.

Prof. Turnidge goes on to say that "Everyone is very depressed about it
because we thought we had everything in place to prevent it," and that "At
the moment we are monitoring where it is appearing and controlling the
spread." The article also reports that patients with VRE are immediately
put in isolation.

VRE is untreatable, and those most vulnerable are the immuno-compromised,
those undergoing chemotherapy, and transplant recipients. VRE colonizes the
bowel, and may be present "in any one of us" without causing infection.
Prof. Turnidge is also reported to have said that while VRE has been found in
animals following extensive testing on the feces of cattle, pigs and poultry
in the Hunter Valley, no definite link between animals and humans had been
established.
