Re: Koi herpesvirus - Japan
---------------------------
(Further to ProMED-mail posting 20031104.2734): As of Sun 9 Nov 2003, 7
prefectures have reported such deaths among wild and captive carp and koi.
Agricultural officials and representatives of other relevant agencies are
reported to be actively investigating the outbreaks. Apparently, they will
begin with the water bodies in the affected prefectures and marketing
pathways. One hopes this will include the water tanks used to transport
live fish, although they were not specifically mentioned in the nightly
news reports.
Of interest, reports of carp deaths in Okayama Prefecture preceded the
Ibaraki outbreak by several months (March and May 2003). Obvious links are
not apparent at this point in the investigation, so the Okayama outbreaks
are regarded as independent for the moment. But it is included in the
national investigation.
The Ibaraki aquafarms produce approximately half of the annual amount of
carp consumed in the region. Compounding the total loss of the harvest this
year are the logistical difficulties of properly disposing of over half a
million dead fish. The Ibaraki aquafarms tend to be small businesses with
few staff members, and the Prefectural Govenor has pledged assistance in
the monumental cleanup.
Results of preliminary surveys are expected soon. Everyone involved in the
sale or shipment of carp in the affected prefectures have been asked to
voluntarily refrain from doing so until further notice.
As an indication of the priority placed on the prompt active response to
these outbreaks, consumers have seen repeated televised assurances that the
virus will not harm humans if they happen to eat infected carp. These
notices have come during prime-time newscasts even during the 12-day
campaign period for the Lower House general election of the national
Parliament, which ended on Sun, 9 Nov 2003.
