Increase in human rabies cases
------------------------------
The incidence of human rabies in Russia has increased almost 2-fold
during the past 8 months of 2010 in comparison with the same period in
2009. In total 11 people were diagnosed with rabies this year whereas
only 6 were diagnosed during the corresponding 8 months of 2009.

There were 3 cases in Astrakhan Oblast, 2 cases in Nizhniy Novgorod
Oblast, one each in the Republic of Karelia and the Dagestan, Samara,
Ulyanovsk & Chelyabinsk Oblasts and the Jewish Autonomous Okrug. This
increase in human rabies cases is a cause for concern since human
rabies is a preventable disease.
