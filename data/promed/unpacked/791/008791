Tests point to (possible) domestic source behind anthrax letter attacks
--------------------------------------------------
Army scientists have reproduced the anthrax powder used in the 2001 mail
attacks and concluded that it was made using simple methods, inexpensive
equipment, and limited expertise, according to government sources familiar
with the work. The findings reinforce the theory that has guided the FBI's
18-month-long investigation: that the mailed anthrax was probably produced
by renegade scientists and not a military program such as Iraq's.

"It tends to support the idea that the anthrax came from a domestic source
and probably not a state program," said David Siegrist, a bioterrorism
expert at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies. "It shows you can have
a fairly sophisticated product with fairly rudimentary methods." [The logic
thereby pointing to a domestic source is not strong, even if one believes
it was domestic, as I do. - Mod.MHJ]

The new research, carried out at the Army's biodefense center at Dugway
Proving Ground in Utah, raises the disquieting possibility that al-Qaida
and other terrorist groups could create lethal bioweapons without
scientific or financial help from a state. The Bush administration had
cited the possibility that Iraq might supply weapons to al-Qaida as a key
reason for overthrowing Saddam Hussein.

"It would be better for our country if they'd concluded that [the mailed
anthrax] had to have been made in a big facility with a lot of biowarfare
experts," said David R. Franz, a former Army biodefense official and
consultant on bioterrorism.

But Richard O. Spertzel, a biowarfare expert and former United Nations
weapons inspector in Iraq, said he has heard that the Dugway research
failed to match exactly the purity and small particle size of the mailed
anthrax. Though he has no involvement in the case, he believes the FBI
would be wrong to rule out Iraq or other states as the source of the deadly
powder.

Van Harp, assistant FBI director in charge of the Washington Field Office,
who oversees the anthrax investigation, declined to comment on what he
called "uninformed speculation" about the anthrax research. But Harp said
50 investigators are still working on what the bureau calls the Amerithrax
case, backed by "a huge scientific effort." "We're making progress," he said.

FBI and Postal Inspection Service agents initially considered a link to the
Sept. 11 hijackers or Iraq. But after genetic analysis showed the anthrax
was derived from the Ames strain used in the U.S. military biodefense
program, investigators concentrated their effort on a domestic source.

Agents interviewed and conducted polygraph tests on scores of employees at
the U.S. military biodefense research centers at Fort Detrick in Frederick
and at Dugway Proving Ground.

Since last summer, they have focused much of their effort on Dr. Steven J.
Hatfill, a former Fort Detrick bioweapons expert, repeatedly searching his
Frederick apartment. In December and January 2003, the FBI launched an
extensive search in woods and ponds outside Frederick, an effort sources
said was aimed at finding discarded biological equipment or other evidence.

Meanwhile, FBI agents still appear to be scrutinizing Hatfill, [who] has
adamantly denied any connection to the anthrax letters. 2 weeks ago, 2
agents visited Insight magazine reporter Timothy W. Maier in Washington to
ask him about an interview he conducted with Hatfill in 1998. They seemed
particularly interested in a photograph printed in Insight that year of
Hatfill posing in bioprotection gear, demonstrating "how a determined
terrorist could cook up a batch of plague in his or her own kitchen using
common household ingredients and protective equipment from the
supermarket," as the caption put it.

The FBI's Amerithrax task force ordered an exhaustive battery of scientific
tests on the anthrax. Outside scientists say researchers probably have used
chemical analysis to trace the water and nutrients used to grow the anthrax
to a particular geographic area. As part of the scientific sleuthing, FBI
Director Robert S. Mueller III announced in November that investigators
were trying to "reverse engineer" the mailed anthrax. [Thus, presumably the
Dugway studies. - Mod.MHJ]

Several sources discussed the work with The Sun on condition of anonymity.
One investigator said that with about a dozen samples completed, scientists
have matched the mailed powder closely enough to conclude it was made with
"a pretty small operation" that cost "no more than a few thousand dollars."
The perpetrator would have needed expertise in microbiology to separate the
dormant anthrax spores from the living vegetative cells, to dry the spores
without killing them, and to mill the product, the source said. But the
methods used point more to a makeshift lab than a professional operation,
the source said. One clue pointing away from a state program was the
absence of any additive to neutralize the spores' electrical charge and
make them float more freely.

Such additives or coatings, including glass-like silica, were routinely
used in past U.S., Soviet and Iraqi bioweapons programs, and some accounts
have suggested that silica was present in the mailed anthrax. But more
thorough testing disproved that. "Everybody was looking for a coating, but
there wasn't one," the investigator said.

The government is retaining detailed data on the various anthrax samples
produced, creating a reference library to help track the source of powder
used in any future anthrax attack.

[It was originally widely reported that the anthrax spores used in the
postal attacks were weaponized and had been produced in a highly
sophisticated manner. If as now reported, it is true that the anthrax
spores were produced by "a pretty small operation" and at a cost of "no
more than a few thousand dollars", it is hardly reassuring. - Mod.DK]

[In reality, all we know is that this powder is not that difficult to
produce, plus some revisionist reporting on the original quality. I would
like to know whether the Dugway people monitored the contamination during
the learning process; many have commented how complicated it would have
been for the inexperienced, even with the right equipment. And if they
pulled it off on their first or second attempt, it would argue for someone
with a remarked-upon ability to get a piece of new equipment to work for
them in minutes being put back in the suspect corral.

Of course, this experiment can be read to mean that anyone with a modicum
of adequate microbiological skills (on the order of a graduate student)
could do this, possibly over a number of weekends, on a piece of
institutional equipment without others knowing about it, as long as they
cleaned up carefully as they went along. But I imagine that such cleaning
would be part and parcel of using such a piece of equipment, as it would be
used during the week to routinely produce a range of microbiological and
pharmaceutical products which must not be cross-contaminated. Sensibly they
have not described the needed basic equipment. The claimed simplicity of
the method just lengthens the list of possible perpetrators, which can now
perhaps include some who previously had not been given a high priority when
the product was held to a higher standard. - Mod.MHJ]
