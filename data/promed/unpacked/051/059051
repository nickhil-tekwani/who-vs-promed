Thailand: avian influenza situation - WHO update 40
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Public Health in Thailand has confirmed a further case of
human infection with H5N1 avian influenza. The case is an 18 month old boy
from a suburb of Bangkok. He developed symptoms on 1 Nov 2005 and was
admitted to hospital on 5 Nov 2005. He remains in good condition. This is
the 4th laboratory confirmed case in Thailand this year [2005]. Since
January 2004, Thailand has reported 21 cases, of which 13 were fatal.

Thailand: baby recovers, grandmother negative
---------------------------------------------
A Bangkok toddler who tested positive for bird flu is now fully recovered,
but will have to remain in hospital for 3 weeks to meet international
health requirements, a senior health official said on Mon 14 Nov 2005. His
grandmother, who was tested for the H5N1 virus, turned out to have ordinary
human flu, Disease Control Department chief Thawat Suntrajarn told Reuters.
"He is fully recovered now because he was infected with only [a] small
amount of the virus and was given prompt treatment," Thawat said of the 1st
case in the Thai capital since a flare-up of the deadly disease a month
ago. "His grandmother tested negative twice, but we have to keep testing
her until she is discharged from hospital," he said.
Thawat said the 18 month old boy might have contracted the H5N1 virus from
the droppings of chickens that died around his home in an eastern suburb of
Bangkok.
The virus -- which has killed 13 Thais since it swept across large parts of
Asia in late 2003 -- has re-emerged in 10 of Thailand's 76 provinces,
mainly in central areas, since the beginning of last month [Oct 2005]. 5
provinces were later declared free of the disease after a 21 day
surveillance period. Despite the spread of the virus to the outskirts of
Bangkok, outbreaks remain far fewer than at the same time last year [2004],
when 44 of Thailand's 76 provinces reported bird flu cases.

Indonesia: president puts death toll at 7
-----------------------------------------
Indonesia's president said on Mon 14 Nov 2005 that 7 people had died in the
country from avian influenza, announcing a higher death toll than the World
Health Organization, which puts the number of confirmed fatalities at 5.
"I have paid special attention to the greater Jakarta area. From what I
have gathered, there are 11 (positive) sufferers, and out of those 7 have
died," Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told a news conference after a cabinet
meeting to discuss the H5N1 virus outbreak.

Indonesia: youth tests positive for H5N1 virus infection
--------------------------------------------------------
Indonesian tests on a 16 year old youth show he is suffering from the H5N1
bird flu virus, but the results have to be confirmed by a laboratory in
Hong Kong, a hospital spokesman said on Mon 15 Nov 2005.
Spokesman Ilham Patu and the Health Ministry said tests were also being
conducted on 2 other patients who died over the weekend [12-13 Nov 2005] in
the Sulianti Saroso Hospital, Jakarta's hospital for treating bird flu
patients.
Patu said the 16 year old youth was admitted to the Sulianti Saroso
Hospital on 11 Nov 2005. He was in intensive care, Patu added, without
saying whether the teenager had been in contact with dead chickens.
Indonesia has had 5 deaths from bird flu confirmed by the Hong Kong
laboratory, which is recognized by the World Health Organization. Another 4
people have been confirmed to have contracted the virus but have survived.
[As of 14 Nov 2005, the WHO laboratory has confirmed 7 cases, 4 of which
have been fatal. - Mod.CP]
Patu said the 2 patients who died over the weekend [12-13 Nov 2005] in the
hospital after suffering bird flu-like symptoms were a 20 year old woman
and a 13 year old girl. An initial local test on the girl had proven
negative for bird flu, he said. [However, it was reported later by Reuters
<http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/JAK158494.htm> that the 20 year
old woman had tested positive for H5N1 virus infection by laboratory test
carried out locally. The results of confirmatory tests from Hong Kong were
awaited. - Mod.CP]
The government last week [2nd week November 2005] said local testing had
shown a 16 year old girl had died of bird flu, but officials are still
waiting for confirmation from Hong Kong.

Viet Nam: 2 new suspected human cases of avian influenza
--------------------------------------------------------
Avian influenza may have infected 2 more people in Viet Nam, where
scientists say [the virus] has mutated into a more dangerous form which
could spread in mammals, and caused outbreaks in poultry. State newspapers
said on Mon 14 Nov 2005 that a student was being tested in hospital after
eating chicken eggs along with samples from a 78 year old woman who died
from serious pneumonia in the central province of Quang Binh on Fri 11 Nov
2005.
An Agriculture Ministry report said the H5N1 virus had now hit 10 of Viet
Nam's 64 provinces since returning in early October 2005. Viet Nam's death
toll since the virus 1st arrived in late 2003 is 42 [41 according to WHO].
The latest affected area is the northern port of Haiphong, where 1000 ducks
and chickens died in 4 farms last week [2nd week November 2005].
"There is much possibility that the disease spreading is due to improper
quarantine of infected poultry and poultry products," Bui Quang Anh, head
of the Ministry's animal health department, said in an urgent message to
provincial authorities. Search-and-destroy task force groups must be set up
to deal with sick poultry, he said.
The Ho Chi Minh Pasteur Institute said its decoding of 24 samples of the
H5N1 virus taken from poultry and humans showed a significant variation of
antigen [presumably the surface proteins of the virus, HA and NA]. "The
H5N1 type that infected people and waterfowl in early 2005 has several
mutations focusing in the important functional parts of the surface
proteins," the institute said on its website <http://www.pasteur-hcm.org.vn>.
"There has been a mutation allowing the virus to breed effectively on
mammal tissue and become highly virulent," it said. The study also found a
mutation of the PB2 gene in a virus sample from a patient who died in the
southern Dong Thap province earlier this year [2005]. The finding showed
the virus had been combining changes to adapt to new hosts, Sunday's [13
Nov 2005] Quan Doi Nhan Dan newspaper quoted Cao Bao Van, head of the
Molecule Biology Department, as saying.
Viet Nam is gearing up its battle against bird flu, with Hanoi and Ho Chi
Minh City officials spreading the word about a 15 Nov 2005 deadline from
when poultry raising will be banned in those cities. The Hanoi's People
Committee said live poultry will be destroyed from Thursday [17 Nov 2005]
if found in the capital. Last week, Agriculture Minister Cao Duc Phat said
police and soldiers would be used to quarantine farms, destroy sick poultry
and man checkpoints to control poultry transportation better.
[The evidence relating these particular mutations in the HA, NA and PB2
genes of H5N1 avian influenza to the host range phenotype of the virus is
not stated and must await critical evaluation when the data are published
in the scientific literature. - Mod.CP]
