On Wednesday, 3 Sep 2008, the Mongolian news agency Daily News
[<http://www.dailynews.mn>, in Russian]
reported about unidentified bird mortality.

It states that a total of 2000 sandgrouse were found dead in
Uvurkhangai [Ovorhangay] aimag's Bayangol and Tugrug soums and in
Dundgobi [Dundgovi] aimag's Saihan Ovoo soum [Central Mongolia, map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/mongolia_pol96.jpg>.
"Aimag" is the Mongolian term for a 1st level administrative
subdivision or province. - Mod.AS].

Professionals have been investigating the cause of mortality but are
still unable to identify it. It also reports that National Emergency
Management Agency (NEMA) officers were on site to destroy the dead
birds and to disinfect the area.

The NEMA emergency group head, Mr. Ch. Batchuluun, reported that a
total of 2460 sandgrouse were found dead. Furthermore, a few other
birds such as cranes (3), sparrows (1), crows (2) and ground jays (2)
were found dead in Dundgobi aimag's Saihan Ovoo soum. He also stated
that professionals from the State Department of Veterinary Services
have joined their team during the investigation. They have done avian
influenza rapid testing on dead birds and found no suspect cases.
Therefore, the State Central Veterinary Laboratory collected samples
to do more rigorous testing to identify the cause of mortality.

He added that ornithologists suspect that the deaths are due to
mechanical injuries, as they have observed broken wings in some
birds. They also suspect that environmental factors such as strong
winds may have caused the mass mortality. The NEMA officers do not
agree, because sandgrouse are resident birds and are adapted to the
local environment fairly well; besides that, we have not observed
this type of mass mortality before.

He went on to say that they have done a comparative necropsy on dead
and healthy birds but did not observe any pathologic findings. He
also reported that most of the birds were dead in close proximity to
high power electric poles. For instance, 1737 birds were dead along
the high power line close to Dundgobi aimag's Saihan Ovoo soum, while
349 sandgrouse and a sparrow were dead approximately 11 km from
Uvurkhangai aimag's Tugrug soum.

There were no human deaths or illnesses observed in the area.

[We are grateful to Enkhtuvshin Shiilegdamba for the above information.

The species of the affected sandgrouse is, likely, the Pallas'
Sandgrouse (_Syrrhaptes paradoxus_), belonging to the order
Pteroclidiformes; picture at
<http://www.birdwatchingtours.co.uk/gallery/pix/Kazakhstan/pix_2007/pallass_sandgrouse_l.jpg>.
No bird of the said order could be found in the USGS list of birds
found so far infected with the HPAI H5N1 virus.

Results of the epidemiological and laboratory investigations are
anticipated. - Mod.AS]
