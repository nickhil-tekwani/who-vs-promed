[In an earlier posting there was a report of "Sea Dragons" dying. For those
wondering what these are, here is the answer, and an indication of why they
might be considered susceptible to the pilchard infection. By the way, the
websites are well worth visiting. - Mod.MHJ

Seadragons are fish belonging to the family Syngnathidae (which also
includes the better known seahorses and pipefish). There are two species of
seadragon within Australian waters - the Weedy Seadragon (_Phyllopteryx
taeniolatus_) and the Leafy Seadragon (_Phycodurus eques_). Both are
distributed across Australia's southern temperate coastline. Both grow to
<40cm in length.
If you'd like to have a look (they are spectacular animals), a photo of a
leafy seadragon is available at:
