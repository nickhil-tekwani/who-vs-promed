Public health officials and the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) are continuing to see an elevated number of hepatitis A cases in the state.

Since the beginning of the outbreak in [August 2016], public health response has included increased healthcare awareness efforts, public notification and education, and outreach with vaccination clinics for high-risk populations. No common sources of food, beverages, or drugs have been identified as a potential source of infection. Transmission appears to be through direct person-to-person spread and illicit drug use. Those with history of injection and non-injection drug use, homelessness or transient housing, and incarceration are thought to be at greater risk in this outbreak setting. Notably, this outbreak has had a high hospitalization rate.

[Cumulatively, 14.6 percent of the total males are MSM, 2.8 percent of the total are healthcare workers, and 4.8 percent of the total are food handlers. More cases continue to occur, spreading north and west of the main southeastern Michigan focus of the outbreak. The total cases continue to increase and have altogether in numbers and in fatalities surpassed the numbers of the now essentially ended southern California outbreak.

Since [1 Jan 2017], Utah public health has identified 230 confirmed cases of hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection; many among persons who are homeless and/or using illicit drugs. Several cases have been linked by investigation and/or viral sequencing to a national outbreak of hepatitis A involving cases in California and Arizona. Hospitalization rates of less than 40 percent have been described in previous hepatitis A outbreaks; however, other jurisdictions associated with this outbreak are reporting case hospitalization rates approaching 70 percent. The high rate of hospitalization may be a result of cases having underlying illnesses (e.g., alcoholism), or a higher rate of hepatitis comorbidities (e.g., hepatitis B or C). In response to the outbreak, public health officials have been working to identify cases and contacts, provide education, and ensure opportunities for vaccination of close contacts to cases and vulnerable populations.

Hepatitis A is usually spread through having oral contact with items contaminated with hepatitis A, for example, through ingesting food or drinks contaminated by infected feces. Some people do not develop symptoms, even if infected. If symptoms occur, they usually appear anywhere from 2-6 weeks after exposure. Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days, and may include jaundice (the yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes), abdominal pain, nausea or diarrhea. Hepatitis A vaccination is the best way to prevent hepatitis A infection.

[It is interesting that so far in Utah there have been no fatalities whereas the large outbreaks in southern California and southeastern Michigan reported case fatality rates of 3-4 percent. The hospitalization rate in Utah while high is also substantially below the 70-80 percent rate in those other outbreaks.

The Indiana State Department of Health (ISDH) is working with local health departments in southern Indiana to respond to a recent increase in hepatitis A cases, many of which are tied to a large outbreak in Kentucky.

In the last month, 17 cases of hepatitis A have been confirmed statewide, including 11 in Clark and Floyd counties. Since [1 Jan 2018], ISDH has confirmed 40 cases of hepatitis A statewide. Typically, fewer than 20 cases are confirmed each year in Indiana.

Many of the southern Indiana cases have involved inmates in the Clark County Jail. However, an elementary school in Clark County and a Bob Evans restaurant on State Street in New Albany also have been impacted.

"Hepatitis A is a highly contagious virus, and seeing this many cases in such a short timeframe is concerning," said State Health Commissioner Kris Box, MD, FACOG. "We are working closely with our local partners to identify individuals who may have been exposed and to halt the transmission of disease."
