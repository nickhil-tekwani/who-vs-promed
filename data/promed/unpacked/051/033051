Local health units are trying to control an outbreak of whooping cough [pertussis] in Bruce and Huron Counties [Ontario, Canada]. There are 39 cases in southern Bruce County, mainly in an under-immunized population. Huron County Health unit is also reporting a significant number of cases in the north part of the county.

The serious bacterial infection of the respiratory system is easily spread through coughing and sneezing. It starts with an irritating cough, which becomes more severe, and is often following by vomiting. It can last longer than 2 months. A characteristic crowing or high-pitched whoop may occur during the cough. Pregnant women and infants not fully immunized are at risk. Up-to-date immunizations can prevent infection. Complications may include pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, chronic lung damage and occasionally deaths in infants.

Pertussis is preventable through immunization. It is one of the 1st set of immunizations recommended for all babies. It is also included in the Ontario Immunization Of School Pupils Act. It is highly recommended that immunizations of all family members, including grandparents, be up-to-date for pertussis before arrival of a new baby into a family. Parents are asked to check their child's immunization status to ensure it is current. Routine childhood immunizations include the pertussis vaccine. Adults can receive one dose of pertussis containing vaccine along with tetanus and diphtheria.

Local hospital emergency departments, family physicians and nurse practitioners have been notified of this outbreak. The Grey Bruce Health Unit is continuing to hold assessment and immunization clinics to immunize families in the outbreak area and to ensure the follow-up of cases.

[Huron County, with a population of 59 000 in 2011, is located in the Southwestern subregion of the Canadian province of Ontario, on the shore of Lake Huron (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huron_County,_Ontario). Bruce is an adjacent county is in Southwestern Ontario, north of Huron County (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Ontario).

The following is extracted from the moderator comments in ProMED post Pertussis - USA (10): (KS) fatal, update 20150618.3446509:

In the U.S., DTaP and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd-vac/pertussis/default.htm#vacc). Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D), tetanus (T) toxoids, and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lower-case "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult-formulations. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years of age. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Expectant mothers should receive Tdap during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Pertussis is nationally notifiable to the CDC (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/outbreaks/trends.html). Following the introduction of pertussis vaccines in the 1940s when case counts frequently exceeded 100 000 cases per year, case counts declined dramatically to fewer than 10 000 by 1965. During the 1980s the incidence of pertussis began increasing gradually, and peaked in 2012 at 48 277 cases of pertussis (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/images/incidence-graph.jpg). This was the most reported cases since 1955. Pertussis again declined during 2013 and by 2014, more than 28 000 cases were reported nationwide.

Because infants who are too young to be fully vaccinated are the most vulnerable to severe, sometimes fatal, cases of pertussis, it is important for all those in close contact with newborns and infants (such as, parents, grandparents, siblings, and other care givers) to have up-to-date vaccination. In 2014, over 10 percent of cases occurred in children under 6 months of age and the incidence rate of pertussis among infants in this age group (about 150 cases per 100 000) exceeded that of all other age groups (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/pertuss-surv-report-2014.pdf). Most deaths from pertussis occur in infants less than 3 months old. - Mod.ML
