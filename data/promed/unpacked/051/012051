Almost 50 people are sick in France with _Salmonella_ infections after eating a type of dry cured sausage from Spain. In total, 45 people have been affected including 27 children. All sick people interviewed so far mentioned eating fuet before onset of symptoms. Strains of monophasic _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium sharing the same genetic characteristics were identified between 24 Jun and 15 Jul [2021] by the National Reference Center for _Salmonella_. This means they are likely to be from the same source.

The link with consumption of fuet produced by the Spanish company Embutidos Caula SL was made by the general directorate of food (DGAL), general directorate of health, and Sante Publique France. All batches and dates of fuet sold under different brand names that are marked ES 10.01865/GE CE have been withdrawn from sale or recalled. Authorities advised people who have the affected products that they should not consume them and recommended they be returned to the place of purchase.

In July and August 2020, 42 people fell sick in France in another monophasic _Salmonella_ Typhimurium outbreak traced to fuet from Spain. Children were also sick in this incident that was linked to a company in Spain called Embutidos Sola.

[The monophasic _S._ Typhimurium variant is likely to be _Salmonella enterica_ 1,4,[5],12:i:-). Monophasic _S._ Typhimurium with the Typhimurium O somatic antigens do not have a complete set of flagellar (H) antigens.

"Fuet is a Catalan thin, dry-cured sausage of pork meat in a pork gut. The most famous is made in the comarca (county) of Osona and is also known as Vic fuet (fuet de Vic, after the city of Vic, capital of Osona). It is flavored with black pepper and garlic, and sometimes aniseed, but unlike chorizo, contains no paprika" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuet).

The following is a relatively recent review of this organism:

Abstract
--------
"_Salmonella enterica_ remains an important foodborne pathogen in all regions of the world, with Typhimurium as one of the most frequent serotypes causing foodborne disease. However, the past 2 decades have seen a rapid worldwide emergence of a new _Salmonella_ serotype, namely monophasic variant of _S._ Typhimurium, whose antigenic formula is 1,4,[5],12:i:-. It has become one of the 2-5 most common _Salmonella_ serotypes responsible for animal and human infections in different regions. The global epidemic of monophasic S. 1,4,[5],12:i:- has mainly been characterized by an increase in multidrug-resistant _S._ 1,4,[5],12:i:- isolated in Europe since 1997. The unexpected link to swine has escalated monophasic _S._ Typhimurium infections to the status of a global public health emergency. The large-scale application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in the last 10 years has revealed the phylogenetic associations of the bacterium and its antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. Local and global transmission reconstructed by WGS have shown that different clones have emerged following multiple independent events worldwide, and have elucidated the role of this zoonotic pathogen in the spread of AMR. This article discusses our current knowledge of the global ecology, epidemiology, transmission, bacterial adaptation, and evolution of this emerging _Salmonella_ serotype. - Mod.LL
