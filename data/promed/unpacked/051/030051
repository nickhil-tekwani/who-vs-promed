The yellow fever vaccination campaign launched by the Ministry of Health in many states throughout Sudan in December [2014] has reached almost 4 million people aged between 9 months and 60 years old.

According to the Ministry of Health, an estimated 1.9 million people were vaccinated in 15 localities in North Darfur. The population of Kabkabiya, El Sareif Beni Hussein, and Saraf Umra localities had been covered in a similar campaign in 2012, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported in its last weekly bulletin of 2014.

In Central Darfur, UNICEF and partners successfully conducted a vaccination programme in the region of Jebel Marra, targeting just over 88 000 people. The vaccination programme actually reached more than 93 000 people. The region was left out of the 2012 yellow fever vaccination campaign because of logistical and security concerns.

The coverage rate was 85 per cent for East Darfur, where 382 000 of the targeted 450 000 people were reached in the localities of Adila, Abu Karinka, Asalaya, Abu Jabra, and Bahr El Arab. In South Darfur, some 588 000 people were vaccinated, resulting in a 93 per cent coverage rate.

OCHA reported that the yellow fever vaccination campaign in South and West Kordofan, which initially targeted just over 885 000 people, actually managed to vaccinate 962 000 people.

[It is gratifying to see that the yellow fever (YF) vaccination numbers targeted were exceeded on the ground. Health officials and the collaborating organizations are to be congratulated for reaching populations in parts of the country that are logistically difficult to access. However, it is not clear what prompted initiation of the vaccination campaign. Were there recent YF cases in these areas? In any case, maintenance of extensive vaccination coverage in this area in the absence of an ongoing outbreak is far preferable to response during or following one.

One can also not help but wonder whether the YF vaccination campaign is a result of the undiagnosed cases of hemorrhagic fever that have been occurring in several parts of Sudan very recently. On 24 Oct 2014, 4 cases of an undiagnosed hemorrhagic fever were reported (see ProMED-mail archive number 20141028.2907268). The 5 Nov 2014 report indicated that there were 5 cases, and an 11 Nov 2014 report indicated an increase to 25 cases (see ProMED-mail archive number 20141111.2946812). The most recent report indicated 30 cases including 19 fatalities in a different state in the same general area of Sudan. Cases have now been reported from South Darfur, West and North Kordofan, and most recently El Gezira.

Yellow fever is not new to the Sudan. Between 3 Oct and 24 Nov 2013, a total of 44 confirmed cases of YF were reported, including 14 deaths. A total of 12 localities in West and South Kordofan were affected by that outbreak.

There was a large YF outbreak in Darfur state in 2012-2013. In 2012, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that over 840 people were infected with yellow fever in Darfur and that the epidemic had affected 35 out of 64 localities in the region since September 2012.
