The Durango Health Secretariat confirmed this Saturday [12 Nov 2022] the death of a woman from aseptic meningitis due to fungus, the 4th death from this condition.

The state agency stressed that the victim had a gynecologic and obstetric procedure carried out in a private hospital.

With this unfortunate death, 4 people have died due to this disease, which is why care is already provided to relatives through comprehensive assistance and supplies.

The Ministry of Health reported as of the end of Saturday [12 Nov 2022] there are no new cases of aseptic meningitis due to fungus and 42 cases remain.

The General Hospital 450, as well as those of ISSSTE [Mexican Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers] and IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute], follow the same protocol and the necessary medical infrastructure to provide immediate care in the event of any suspicion of this condition.

The cases of aseptic meningitis in Durango were caused by a fungus, so immediate treatment is instructed for patients and to continue with comprehensive care for families.

The Secretary of Health, Irasema Kondo Padilla, confirmed the above and stressed that there are currently 41 confirmed cases and 3 deaths [now 4].

The results of the studies of etiological factors determined the cause of illness of people from various private hospitals in Durango; meanwhile, the Cofepris (Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risks) continues with the investigations to establish the mechanism of contamination.

When the cause of this condition is known, the treatment of the patients begins. It was recognized that it is expensive, but at this time the health of the patients is considered, and comprehensive care will be provided with hospitalization, treatment, and medications, as well as the necessary requirements for family members.

Kondo Padilla explained that the results of various laboratories of the Health Sector and the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition "Salvador Zubirán" coincided in the presence of a fungus in the cases of affected patients; confirmation of the results from INDRE (Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference) is also expected.

As of today [10 Nov 2022], there are 41 confirmed cases of patients with aseptic meningitis, 40 women and one man; 3 unfortunate deaths are reported, the last registered after medical attention was provided at the IMSS hospital.

The number of cases of aseptic meningitis increased to 10, so the Durango Health Secretariat coordinates protection actions in private hospitals. Irasema Kondo Padilla, Secretary of Health in the entity, stressed that actions, such as the IMSS, ISSSTE, Hospital 450, as well as SEDENA [Ministry of National Defense], are linked to respond to the health situation. During the meeting, the doctors representing the private hospitals presented their cases and the measures they are taking to contain the situation.

It was agreed to carry out a census of patients, and concentrate on those affected in the care module at Hospital 450, IMSS, and ISSSTE if they are beneficiaries. In case of requiring a surgical procedure, they will be referred to the Maternal and Child Hospital.

In the same way, it was agreed that the doctors representing the various hospitals, will have to report on possible cases on the page provided by COPRISED (Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risks of Durango State; http://coprised.durango.gob.mx/; telephone 618 1 37 70 98) that present the characteristics according to the operational definition (female of reproductive age, subjected to a gynecologic-obstetric procedure through a blockade, starting in May 2022, and presenting intractable headache).

In addition, the public will be informed that the communication will be sent through the corresponding areas, urging them to review formal and official sources, in order to avoid false or erroneous news.

For his part, Carlos Maa Mares, representative of the private hospitals in Durango, announced that public and private hospitals are coordinated to carry out investigations and obtain results on the origin of cases of aseptic meningitis.

[Durango City (pop., 654 876 in 2015) is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Durango, located in northwestern Mexico (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango_City).

The latest news report above says that there are now a total of 42 patients, including 4 deaths, of "aseptic meningitis" apparently at several different hospitals in Durango City in the Durango State of Mexico, as a postoperative complication. 41 of the 42 affected patients are women who underwent some type(s) of surgeries that involved epidural anesthesia and use of a medication that has been seized by the investigating authorities. We are now told that the cause of the meningitis is a "fungus", but we are not told specifically which fungus is the cause or the means by which this infection occurred. Could it be due to fungal contaminant of a drug that was injected during an epidural procedure?

An epidural injection is delivery of a drug between the dura mater and the vertebral wall. Epidurals can be used during labor and childbirth, during and after some types of surgery, and to treat pain due to sciatica or a slipped disc. Fungal contamination of a drug administered epidurally caused the large, multistate invasive fungal infection outbreak associated with contaminated methylprednisolone injections in late 2012 and 2013 in the US (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4669562/) and another fungal meningitis outbreak in 2002 (ProMED post Fungal meningitis, contaminated drug - USA (03) 20021212.6046).

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
