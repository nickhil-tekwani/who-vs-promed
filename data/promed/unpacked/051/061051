CHAGAS DISEASE ECOLOGY: REQUEST FOR INFO

I am writing a term paper for a graduate school course --anthropology of
medicine-- I am interested in the wide adaptation of _T. infestans_ in
varied environments. In the excerpt I read, it said "possibly the extreme
adaptation of _T. infestans_ to houses (in special those with mud walls) is
responsible for it's capacity to survive to a large variety of
environments." Have there been any papers published (or not published but
available) backing up this statement? Is the adaptability of _T. infestans_
a controversial subject?
I want to write about the ecology of this disease and _T. infestans_ or
Chagas disease vector is the crux of the life cycle, therefore, if you
could give me any leads on the extremes in adaptation of _T. infestans_ I
would appreciate it. I would be even more appreciative if the leads could
be sent as soon as possible since I must construct my bibliographic
references by this Thursday.
[I seem to recall many references in the ProMED-mail postings I listed
above. Good luck as the subject of medical anthropology is increasingly
important.- Mod. pc]
