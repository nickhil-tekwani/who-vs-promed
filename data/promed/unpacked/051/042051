Two studies published yesterday [21 Mar 2022] describe the medical consequences of COVID-19 in pregnancy, one finding that the virus may double the risk of severe maternal outcomes and preterm birth, and the other showing that infection can lead to problems with the placenta that may cause fetal loss.

In the first study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, Kaiser Permanente Northern California researchers analyzed the electronic medical records of 43 886 pregnant women who delivered from 1 Mar 2020 to 16 Mar 2021 (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2790318). Average patient age was 30.7 years, 33.8% were White, 28.4% were Hispanic, 25.9% were Asian or Pacific Islander, 6.5% Black, 0.3% American Indian or Alaska Native, and 5% were multiracial or of another race.

Among these women, 1332 (3.0%) tested positive for COVID-19 from 30 days before conception to 7 days after delivery. Infected women were more likely than their uninfected peers to be younger and Hispanic and to have had multiple babies, a higher neighborhood deprivation index, and obesity or chronic high blood pressure. Before universal COVID-19 testing of pregnant women admitted for delivery was implemented in the healthcare system in December 2020, the positivity rate was 1.3%, compared with 7.8% after.

After adjustment for demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and smoking status, infected women were at double to triple the risk for severe illness such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and sepsis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.45), birth at less than 37 weeks gestation (HR 2.08), and venous thromboembolism (blood clots) (HR 3.08).

COVID-19 infection was also tied to an elevated risk of medically indicated preterm birth (for example, for a life-threatening maternal condition such as preeclampsia) (HR 2.56), spontaneous preterm birth (HR 1.61), and early (HR 2.52), moderate (HR 2.18), and late (HR 1.95) preterm birth.

Among infected women, 5.7% were hospitalized for COVID-19. A diagnosis of pregestational diabetes (HR 7.03), as well as Asian/ Pacific Islander (HR 2.33) and Black (HR 3.14) race, was linked to an increased risk of hospitalization.

Of the 307 women diagnosed as having COVID-19 during or 3 weeks before hospitalization, 24.8% (5.7% of the 1332 total infected women) required respiratory support, 1.3% of them received mechanical ventilation, and one died.

"These findings are important in the context of recent SARS-CoV-2 variants, which may be associated with a higher risk of infections and perinatal complications than the previous variants, and the number of young adults and pregnant individuals who remain unvaccinated," the study authors wrote.

In a Kaiser Permanente news release, lead author Assiamira Ferrara said that the results add to growing evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy raises the risks of serious complications (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/946860). "Coupled with the evidence that the COVID-19 vaccines are safe during pregnancy, these findings should aid patients in understanding the risks of perinatal complications and the need for vaccination," she said.

The 2nd study, led by Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) investigators, involved a series of placentas examined from 1 Jan 2020, before the SARS-CoV-2 delta variant wave, to 4 Nov 2021, amid the surge. The findings were published in JAMA Network Open (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2790175).

The team identified 47 cases of placentitis, or inflammation of the placenta, caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection, 8 of them from 2020 and 39 from 2021. Fifteen of the placentas were from MGH patients, while 32 were referred from other facilities for consultation.

The researchers noted that placentitis in COVID-19 patients causes severe placental damage often leading to vaginal hemorrhage and newborn illness and death. Some variants of concern, such as delta, they said, seem to cause more damage than others.

Among all specimens, more than 50% of the placenta was inflamed. Twenty-nine cases (62%), all from 2021, also had multiple intraparenchymal thrombohematomas, or blood clots. Among these cases, 72% resulted in stillbirth. Of the 18 placentas without thrombohematomas, 17 (94%) were from live births. Among the 40 placentas with data on newborn sex, 24 were girls.

"The thrombohematomas are likely a result of severe viral placental damage," the researchers wrote. "Our findings suggest a pathogenetic mechanism for the reported increased risk of stillbirth associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2021."

SARS-CoV-2 strain was identified in 8 cases, of which 3 were delta (2 cases of thrombohematomas resulting in stillbirths, 1 live birth without thrombohematomas), 2 were alpha, and 3 were other strains. Of the cases caused by alpha or other strains, all were live births without thrombohematomas.

Ultrasound documented fetal death in 2 cases, both of which showed large spaces within the placenta filled with maternal blood. When confirmed, COVID-19 infection was most often diagnosed within 14 days before delivery (29 of 33 cases [88%]).

All patients were unvaccinated except one, who was diagnosed as having COVID-19 in 2021, 7 weeks before delivery, and received one vaccine dose; it isn't known if she completed the vaccination series. She delivered a live baby at full-term and had no thrombohematomas.

The authors called for updated epidemiologic studies on pregnancy outcomes to confirm their findings. "Follow-up studies of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 placentitis are required for evaluation of long-term clinical outcomes," they wrote.

A handful of Asian countries that were hit later by omicron variant surges are in different phases of their outbreaks, with South Korea seeing a possible peak. Two days ago [20 Mar 2022], South Korea's daily cases dipped below 300 000 for the 1st time in 10 days, raising hopes among health officials that the country might be nearing its peak, which is expected between 25 Mar and 1 Apr [2022], according to the Korea Herald (http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220321000620).

Today [22 Mar 2022] the country topped 300 000 cases again, as it started the process of gradually easing restrictions, such as raising the limit for private gatherings from 6 to 8. Also, officials are watching if the BA.2 subvariant, which makes up 26.3% of South Korea's sequenced samples, will raise COVID levels.

Elsewhere, China's ongoing surge continues with the highest levels in more than 2 years. Today [22 Mar 2022] the country reported 4594 new local cases, which includes 2313 symptomatic infections. The hardest-hit area for cases continues to be Jilin Province, where most infections are in Changchun and Jilin City.

Roughly one-fourth of the asymptomatic cases are from Shanghai, where health officials are pressing on with block-by-block mass testing in an effort to detect and reduce the spread of the virus.

Meanwhile, cases in Hong Kong appear to be declining from record daily levels in the 1st week of March [2022], with 14 152 cases reported today [22 Mar 2022], as Viet Nam is still reporting cases at very high levels, with 131 709 more yesterday [21 Mar 2022].

Without Congress passing a USD 15 billion COVID funding package, White House officials said the federal government would not have enough funds to buy 4th COVID-19 booster doses for every American who wanted one.

While officials told the Washington Post that the Biden administration has the funds to purchase boosters for adults ages 65 and older and initial vaccine series for children 5 and younger -- if approved -- they currently cannot buy 4th booster doses for the general population (https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2022/03/22/funding-fourth-vaccine-doses/).

The Centers for Disease Control COVID Data Tracker shows that 65.4% of Americans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, 76.8% have received at least one dose of vaccine, and 44.5% of fully vaccinated Americans have received a booster dose (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total).

COVID-19 cases in the United States continue to be significantly lower than during the omicron surge. The nation reported 44 101 new COVID-19 cases yesterday [21 Mar 2022] and 1472 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins COVID-19 tracker (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/cumulative-cases). The 7-day average of new daily cases is 29 612, with 1056 daily deaths, according to the New York Times tracker (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html).

Pediatric COVID-19 cases are also on the decline: According to the latest update from the American Academy of Pediatrics, 32 000 child COVID-19 cases were reported for the week ending 17 Mar 2022. Children represent 18.3% of new US cases.

[4] Intimate partner violence
Date: Tue 22 Mar 2022

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2022/03/covid-19-scan-mar-22-2022


A study today [22 Mar 2022] in Pediatrics from researchers at Boston Children's Hospital suggests that, even during a shift away from face-to-face care, there was an increase in referrals for intimate partner violence (IPV) after the start of the pandemic (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2021-055792).

Face-to-face consults dropped from 28% to 2% when referrals were compared from the 11 months prior to the start of the pandemic to April 2020 through February 2021. But during that period, there was a significant jump in consults (240 to 295; P < 0.001), primarily for emotional abuse (195 to 264; P = 0.007).

Psychoeducation referrals also increased significantly (199 to 273; P < 0.001), while referrals to community resources decreased significantly (111 to 95; P < 0.001), the authors said.

The authors said the increased isolation, school closures, and compounding economic inequities seen during the early month of the pandemic led to more instances of parent and caregiver IPV, and more referrals to the Advocacy for Women and Kids in Emergencies (AWAKE program) embedded at Boston Children's. Children who witness IPV are at greater risk for a number of worse outcomes, the authors said.

In a commentary on the study, Maya Ragavan and Elizabeth Miller write that the lessons of the pandemic should not be forgotten: "Healthcare settings must recognize that IPV agencies are integral to the pediatric medical home and essential collaborators in the provision of healing-centered care for IPV survivors and their children" (https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2022-056980).

[From the commentary: "Parent and caregiver intimate partner violence (IPV), to which 1 in 5 children are exposed, has profound health effects for survivors and their children (1-3). The health, economic, and social ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic have created unique challenges for families experiencing IPV, by increasing isolation, decreasing available safe and secure services and spaces (e.g., schools), and compounding pre-existing inequities, especially for families from marginalized communities (4,5). Pediatric healthcare settings play an important role in supporting families experiencing IPV, particularly through developing partnerships with IPV agencies."

- The European region reported 44.8% of cases and 11.6% of deaths over the last 24 hours, as the most affected region, with cumulative cases exceeding 194.54 million. Countries reporting few or no cases in the last 24 hours or longer include Belgium (10 cases), Portugal, Sweden, and Tajikistan, among others. A total of 28 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours -- 1 country reporting more than 100 000 cases, 12 reporting more than 10 000, and 15 reporting over 1000 cases -- and 1 country reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Americas region (2nd most severely affected region) reported 3.2% of cases and 79.7% of deaths [Chile reported 11 447 of the region's 11 857 deaths, possibly bulk reporting] during the past 24 hours, having reported more than 149.81 million cases overall. Brazil reported 13 218 cases in the last 24 hours. An additional 4 countries reported more than 1000 cases (USA, Argentina, Chile, and Canada) in the past 24 hours. Peru, Colombia, Mexico, and Uruguay reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases. Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Bolivia, among others, did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 0.35% of daily case numbers and 0.45% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 21.51 million cases. Iran (1256) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours, and Bahrain reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases over the last 24 hours.

- The African region reported 0.07% of daily cases and only 10 deaths during the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 8.52 million cases. South Africa (566) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours, while most of remaining countries reported fewer than 50 cases. A total of 27 countries did not report any cases over the last 24 hours. The low reported numbers may not be a true reflection of the prevalent COVID-19 situation in the region, as vaccine coverage remains low.

- The Western Pacific region reported 49.1% of daily case numbers and 6.11% of deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 39.63 million cases. South Korea (353 980) reported the highest number of cases over the last 24 hours, followed by Viet Nam, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, China, Brunei and Laos.

- The South East Asia region reported 2.4% of the daily newly reported cases and 1.9% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 56.80 million cases. Thailand (21 382) reported the highest number of cases, followed by Indonesia (7464), India (1581), Bhutan (240), and Nepal (35). Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Maldives, among others, did not report any cases over the last 24 hours.

[In the past 24 hours, 26 countries -- South Korea (490 707), Germany (268 357), Viet Nam (249 153), France (180 777), Italy (96 904), UK (94 297), Australia (55 903), Spain (54 147), Brazil (41 838), Netherlands (40 534), Austria (34 340), Japan (29 657), USA (27 867), Greece (26 709), Russia (26 394), Thailand (25 164), Switzerland (23 677), Malaysia (21 483), Belgium (21 384), New Zealand (20 154), Turkey (17 426), Israel (15 821), Hong Kong (14 152), Singapore (13 166), Czech Republic (10 462), and Poland (10 159) -- all reported over 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 16 795 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 20 Mar 2022 to late 21 Mar 2022).

A total of 58 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 35 of the 58 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 3 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 9 are from the Western Pacific region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, and none are from the African region. There has been an overall increase in the global trends for cases, with an increasing trend in deaths, especially over the last 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 5.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 29.9% [this increase is linked to over 16 000 cases reported over the last 24 hours]. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 0.27% decrease in daily reported cases and a 59.8% increase in reported deaths [this increase is an anomaly resulting from an adjustment of -2773 deaths during last week].

Impression: The global daily report registered over 1.54 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 474.67 million cumulative reported cases and over 6.12 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
