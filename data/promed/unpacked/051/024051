Virus attack threatens Bangladesh shrimp industry
--------------------------------------------------
Bangladesh's shrimp industry, the country's 2nd largest foreign exchange
earner, is facing its worst ever crisis because of a virus attack.
The 'white spot' disease has swept through shrimp farms concentrated in the
southern Khulna and southeastern Cox's Bazaar regions. Nearly 37 400
shrimp farms, which generate 301 million USD annually from brackish water
shrimp (bagda) and sweet water prawn (golda) have been affected by the
virus. The disease has decimated around 800 nurseries completely, the New
Age reported Friday [23 Jul 2004].
The outbreak has also hit over 6000 shrimp farmers in Bagerhat, severely
impacting the industry.
The shrimp-farming sector may be close to collapsing, experts and farmers
say. They said temperature and heavy rainfall increased the severity of the
disease, reports the daily. Over 600 000 people are directly or indirectly
involved in the industry in Bangladesh, which contributes about 3 percent
of global shrimp production. But many have gone bankrupt while others are
limping.
"I released 12 000 bagda fries in my 2 farms for which I spent about 800
USD. But in return I got almost nothing as most of the fries died after 45
days," said Murad Hossain Patwari in Bagerhat.
Rajab Ali Gazi of the same area said he had invested for [more] than 500
USD and got a return of about 80 USD after 75 days. "This is the story of
all people involved in shrimp farming in the region," Gazi said.
Experts say countries like Thailand and India also collect shrimp from the
same part of Bay of Bengal. But they fight the virus by applying hatchery
management techniques and practices that Bangladesh lacks.
Ron Gillespie, chief of the Agro-based Industries and Technology
Development Project (ATDP), said production would multiply if shrimp
farmers used virus-free post-larvae and followed modern techniques.
Only disease-free post-larvae and controlled shrimp cultivation can help
increase shrimp exports from 300 million to 1.5 billion USD by 2008,
experts say.

[White spot disease (WSD) of penaeid shrimp is characterised by high and
rapid mortality accompanied by gross signs in moribund shrimp of white,
initially circular, inclusions or spots in the cuticle, sometimes
accompanied by overall red body coloration. Disease progression is
characterised by cessation of feeding followed within a few days by the
appearance of moribund shrimp swimming near the surface at the edge of
rearing ponds. The causative agent of WSD is white spot syndrome virus
(WSSV) or white spot virus (WSV), a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus of
the genus Whispovirus within the family _Nimaviridae_. WSSV has a wide host
range among crustaceans and is potentially lethal to most of the
commercially cultivated penaeid shrimp species.
WSD outbreaks were first reported from farmed _Penaeus japonicus_ in Japan
in 1993; later, outbreaks of viral disease with similar gross signs and
caused by similar rod-shaped viruses were reported from elsewhere in Asia,
including the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Thailand, Korea, India,
the Philippines and the USA. During 1999, WSD also had a severe impact on
the shrimp industries of both Central and South America. Further data are
to be seen in chapter 4.1.2 of OIE's manual of diagnostic tests for aquatic
animals,
