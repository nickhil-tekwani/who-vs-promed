Sufficient supplies of anthrax vaccine in place for troops
FORT SAM HOUSTON, Texas, (Army News Service, April 9, 1998) -- Contrary to
recent assertions in some civilian media, plans to vaccinate military
service members against anthrax have not "hit a snag," according to
officials at the Department of Defense Joint Project Office-Biological
Defense [JPO-BD.
"A safe, effective supply of anthrax vaccine is available for use by the
Department of Defense. Lots of the vaccine are currently undergoing
additional testing that was directed by DoD. The decision to conduct this
testing was made to provide DoD with additional information that vaccine
lots in the stockpile are safe and effective. The testing is being done by
MBPI, with independent oversight by a DoD contractor," said Dr. Michael
Gilbreath of JPO-BD.
The Michigan Biologic Products Institute, is the only facility that produces
the Food and Drug Administration licensed vaccine. It has been inspected
several times by the FDA. As a result of a recent inspection, MBPI has
withheld release of some lots of vaccine in the stockpile until it can
review documentation on the lots and answer specific FDA questions related
to those lots.
"After consultation with MBPI regulatory officials, DoD is confident that
the issues associated with the lots being withheld will be addressed by
MBPI, reviewed by the FDA, and the lots subsequently released for use by
DoD. There is, however, no concern about the safety of the vaccine. The
vaccine continues to have an excellent safety record," said Gilbreath.
MBPI shut down in January to renovate its production facilities, not in
response to the November 1996 FDA inspection, according to JPO-BD officials.
"No shutdown was ever directed, occurred or was ever contemplated. The
planned renovation of the vaccine production suite in January 1998 is part
of a DoD acquisition strategy, established in consultation with MBPI, prior
to the 1996 inspection. The renovations are expected to take one year, will
ensure MBPI remains compliant and will help meet the requirements of
(Defense Secretary William Cohen's) immunization plan," said Gilbreath.
Defense officials say the supply of vaccine in hand, some 7 million doses,
should be sufficient to meet DoD's needs until the renovation of MBPI's
production facility is complete. Gilbreath said the additional testing
directed by DoD for the stockpiled vaccine uses FDA requirements as defined
in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations.
MBPI has produced the anthrax vaccine under FDA license since 1970. The
vaccine has been used since that time by civilian veterinarians and
livestock workers, as well as a few military personnel, and MBPI has
received no reports of significant adverse effects.
The Michigan state government, which owns MBPI, decided to sell the facility
in 1995, and has received several bids. When it is sold, the new owners will
assume the contract to supply the vaccine for DoD.
"DoD, MBPI and the FDA have continuously worked together to ensure quality
products are provided to our forces," said Gilbreath. "We are committed to
assuring the sterility, safety, potency, effectiveness and purity of the
vaccine before it is administered to service members."
[However, it has been claimed, 14 April, 1998, by the Veterans for Integrity
in Government, http://www.vetintgov.org, a Washington, D.C.-area non-profit
veterans' advocacy organization, on the basis apparently of a letter from
Dr. Kathryn Zoon, Director/Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,
FDA, March 11, 1997 to Robert Myers, D.V.M., Responsible Head of MBPI, that
"An FDA inspection of the MBPI facility between 18 and 27 November 1996
disclosed 23 'significant deviations from the applicable standards and
requirements' of the Code of Federal Regulations. Most of the violations
were related to quality control problems at the plant. The FDA made it
explicitly clear that if the violations were not corrected, the FDA would
hold public hearings to determine whether the plant's license should be
revoked. The MBPI plant has been shut down since January 1998 ("Anthrax
Snafu." Newsweek, April 6, 1998, p.4.)."

Obviously the MBPI plant has had problems and let us hope that they are
behind them. This thread is now cut. - Mod.MHJ
