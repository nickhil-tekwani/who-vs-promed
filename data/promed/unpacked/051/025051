Another 3 people have been found infected with anthrax at Shahjadpur
Upazila [subdistrict], increasing the list of infected in Pabna
district to 49 in the last 8 days.

Sirajganj civil surgeon Dr Nazimuddin Khan told bdnews24.com that 2
people were found anthrax positive at Bara Maharajpur village and one
more at Chakharipur village under Porjana union council of Shahjadpur
Upazila on Friday [3 Jun 2011]. He said that the patients were given
necessary treatment. "A medical team is working in each of the
affected areas. The patients are being given treatment free of cost."

Meanwhile, a high-level investigation team of the livestock ministry
led by livestock department director general Mohammad Ashraf Ali
visited 2 severely affected villages of the district -- Saratail in
Shahjadpur and Satbila in Ullapara upazilas on Friday [3 Jun 2011].
The remaining members of the team are Dr Mat Yamage (chief technical
advisor Avian Influenza Control Program, FAO-UN), director of
livestock department (admin) Mohammad Modassek Ali, and director
(extension) Partharati Sarker, deputy-director Dr Ranjit Chakrabarti.
They collected the sample of blood of 13 cattle of the areas. They
advised all not to slaughter the ailing cattle and contact the local
livestock department in this regard.

Director general Ashraf Ali said that all the cattle of the affected
areas were vaccinated.

The government officially started reporting human infection of
anthrax in August 2009. The total number of infections was 610 before
the Sirajganj outbreak.

The bacterium can survive in harsh conditions for even centuries in
the soil. Cattle get infected while grazing during the rainy season
when water brings the bacterium to the surface, experts say.

["Were vaccinated" is a flexible term. They may have been vaccinated
in 2010 as a result of the widespread livestock and human cases then.
Reports to date have not indicated any livestock vaccination in
Sirajganj during March and April in advance of any expected outbreaks
in 2011. The Bangladesh Livestock Service uses an Australian vaccine
that they obtained some 23+ years ago; its present composition has not
been validated nor checked for immunogenicity. I am reliably informed
that the field investigation teams are also collecting samples of the
livestock feeds on the various affected dairy farms to check for
contamination with anthrax spores. - Mod.MHJ]

The government has taken initiatives to vaccinate cattle in a bid to
prevent anthrax. The authorities concerned have been directed to
provide anthrax vaccines for around 500 000 cattle of the
anthrax-affected areas.

According to the livestock department, many cattle and some people in
16 districts were infected by anthrax from August to October last year
[2010]. Recently, another anthrax bout hit Sirajganj and Pabna.

Local civil surgeon's office says 46 people were infected by anthrax
in Shahjadpur and Ullapara upazilas of Sirajganj as of Wednesday [1
Jun 2011].

Officials at the livestock department say 20 cattle of the area were
infected by the disease [that the livestock service knows of. -
Mod.MHJ]. Livestock minister Abdul Latif Biswas told bdnews24.com on
Sunday [5 Jun 2011] that an order to provide vaccines in the
anthrax-hit areas was issued. "Livestock officials have been asked to
launch a mass drive to vaccinate all the cattle in the areas," he
said.

In 2010, 104 cattle died from anthrax. Of them, 37 were cows and the
others goats. Of 437 cattle infected by anthrax in 2009, 156 died.
According to the livestock ministry, the department spent Tk 2.45
million [about USD 33 000] on providing compensation to the owners of
the cattle died from anthrax last year [201]. They received Tk 17
000-165 000 [about USD 230-2200] for each cattle and Tk 200 000 [about
USD 2700] for cattle with calves.

[Better late than never. Now that a regular pattern of outbreaks is
emerging thanks to awareness in Dhaka, it can be hoped that in future
years these vaccination programmes will be initiated each Spring
before any livestock cases are expected. - Mod.MHJ]

(IRIN) report [edited]

Health and livestock officials in Bangladesh have expressed concern
over a fresh outbreak of human anthrax in 2 northwestern districts,
but some believe a bigger threat is to livelihoods. "At this stage,
people are panicking more about losing their cattle than getting
anthrax, as it can be treated easily in humans if diagnosed quickly.
The real danger is that tens of thousands of people are at risk of
losing their livelihoods, as meat sales will drastically decline due
to a lack of consumer confidence," said Nazim Uddin Khan, a surgeon in
Sirajganj District, which has seen the highest number of human anthrax
cases.

Sirajganj District, about 100 km [62 mi] from Dhaka, is a hub of the
nation's livestock export and import industry due to its proximity to
the Indian border. Over the past week, 16 new human cases were
reported in Pabna and Sirajganj districts -- both in the northwest --
bringing the total number of cases to 60 since the end of April
[2011], government sources reported on 6 Jun 2011. Of these 60 cases,
48 occurred in Sirajganj, and Khan expected there would be more. This
is the 2nd outbreak of human anthrax in recent times; the 1st was
detected in Sirajganj on 18 Aug 2010, and within a month, 495 people
contracted the disease. [Actually it started in May 2010, but it took
a while for Dhaka to realize it. - Mod.MHJ]

No deaths have been reported so far, as cutaneous (skin) anthrax,
which produces boil-like lesions and ulcers on the skin, is rarely
fatal in humans if treated early with antibiotics, says the Federation
of American Scientists. According to the Institute of Epidemiology,
Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), cutaneous anthrax accounts for
about 95 percent of all human infections.

An IEDCR fact sheet says "vaccination of livestock is the most
efficient way of preventing this disease." But with over 50 million
livestock, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
estimates, this could prove impossible, so herds are being targeted in
specific areas. "Animals in or around the affected areas are our
priority," said Mat Yamage, chief technical adviser at FAO.

Since the beginning of 2011, FAO and the Livestock Ministry have
vaccinated 4600 animals in 3 districts. Last year [2010], nearly 3
million animals were vaccinated. Khan was optimistic the disease would
be better contained this year [2011] given the Department of
Livestock's efforts to raise farmer awareness -- particularly about
how to dispose of infected animal corpses [sic].

Others believe more needs to be done: "More campaigning to raise
awareness is still needed, because sick animals are still being
slaughtered for consumption," said FAO's Yamage.

According to the government, around 75 percent of Bangladesh's 160
million inhabitants rely on livestock to some degree for their
livelihood.

[Members wishing to see the type of cattle affected and the usual
holding facilities on the many small Bangladesh dairy farms, should
check out the gantdaily.com report where there is an informative
photograph. The usual dairy herd is merely some 3 to 12 or so cows,
plus calves and heifers.

Because of the many thousands of small herds and their dispersed
nature, vaccinating these animals is not without problems. When
Antonio Fasanella (Chief of Anthrax Reference Institute of Italy,
L'Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale della Puglia e della
Basilicata) and I visited Bangladesh in December 2010 at the
invitation of the CEO of the Community-based Dairy Veterinary
Foundation (CDVF), Prof Mohammed Shamsuddin, Bangladesh Agricultural
University, we came to the conclusion that as the outbreaks were
during the monsoon flooding that the more probable cause was the use
of contaminated livestock feed; very few animals graze during the
monsoon but are housed and handfed.

This is presently under investigation by the joint ICDDR.B
(International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh) and
IEDCR teams. The strains we recovered from 6 farms visited belonged to
the Sterne-Ames group characteristic of what is seen in central and
eastern China.

Unfortunately the genomics of _Bacillus anthracis_ seen in
Bangladesh's close neighbor India are a closed book due to the latter
government's proscription on allowing any cultures out of the country
and an absence of such studies inside India. - Mod.MHJ]
