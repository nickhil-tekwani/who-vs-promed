It has come to the attention of Ministry of Health that 89 people died in Fangak County. Ministry of Health with partners have deployed teams on the ground who have clearly identified the health issues on the ground. Fangak County is among the most flood-affected locations in South Sudan in 2021. That has increased disease burden of common endemic diseases, such as malaria, acute watery diarrhea, among others. Besides, New Fangak areas [sit] along the Phow River and Sudd swamp, which becomes a challenge to mobility of the population. Only motorized boats are used during flooding season.

On 13 Nov 2021, the Ministry of Health received a report of several deaths from an undiagnosed illness from Fangak County local authority, affecting mostly elderly and children, aged 1 to 14 years. Reported symptoms included diarrhea, high fever, joint pain, vomiting, body weakness, loss of appetite, and chest pain. On 15 Nov 2021, the state Ministry of Health Jonglei State and partners deployed a team of health experts comprising epidemiologists, surveillance officers, clinical officers and laboratory experts to conduct a fact-finding mission and analyze the situation on the ground. The initial finding was a high positivity rate for malaria among those tested at private clinics and Pakaan PHCC.

On 8 Dec 2021, a follow-up mission by MOH Rapid Response Team was deployed for further investigation. According to the investigation report, the team could not verify the 89 deaths reported by the local authorities. However, the investigation found an upsurge of malaria cases in the area. The team reported occurrence of illness in the community presenting with symptoms and signs of malaria (fever, vomiting, diarrhea and loss of appetite) -- a situation aggravated by the flooding which reduces access to health facilities. In one health facility, out of 162 cases, 79 (49%) were reported as malaria RDT positive. Furthermore, the investigation highlighted that communities in New Fangak are served by Pakaan PHCC, which is inaccessible during flooding season. The only one health service point in New Fangak is not adequate to serve all the population.

It is worth noting that, this time of the year, malaria is expected to surge and if not promptly treated, it may lead to excess deaths. The Ministry of Health continues to work with the state and county authorities and partners to ensure flood-affected populations in Fangak and other affected counties have access to the much-needed health services.

Ultimately, the Ministry of Health would like to reassure the public that the reported illness is upsurge of malaria due to flooding situation, and all measures are being taken to improve health service delivery in Fangak County.

[ProMED thanks Mahmoud Orabi for this posting.

Diarrhea does not necessarily mean that the illness is gastrointestinal in origin as, for example, both pneumococcemia and malaria can both present with fever and diarrhea. In a scenario with flooding, which will contribute to mosquito breeding, malaria can increase. Although cholera is not associated with fever, other intestinal infections such as salmonellosis and amoebiasis will cause fever and diarrhea. ProMED awaits more information regarding this outbreak. - Mod.LL
