LEGIONNAIRE'S DISEASE EPIDEMIOLOGY (11)
=======================================
[In reply to query on urine antigen test:]
An EIA [enzyme immunoasay]-based test is available, but remember
this is of somewhat limited value - it's ONLY for L.p.1
[Legionella pneumophila serotype 1], so you still have to
culture if there's any possibility that you're dealing with
any other serotype or species (at least 10% of infections),
and antigen excretion can persist for a long time, though an
epidemiologic study would probably not be confounded by infections
within the previous year which were unrelated to a particular outbreak.
I'd have to check on the vendor.
