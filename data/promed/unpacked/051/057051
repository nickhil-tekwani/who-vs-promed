Rabies in France, imported case
------------------------------
See also: 20 Feb 2004
Emergency report:
Translation of information received on 16 Jul 2004 from Dr. Isabelle
Chmitelin, Deputy Director General, General Directorate for Food (DGAL),
Ministry of Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and Rural Affairs, Paris.
Date of the report: 12 Jul 2004.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 10 May 2004. The
clinical phase of this case of rabies was considered to be from 10 - 15 May
2004. The at-risk phase, in terms of pre-symptomatic excretion of the
rabies virus, which starts 15 days before the onset of the first clinical
signs, was, therefore, considered to be from 25 Apr - 10 May 2004.
Date of confirmation of diagnosis: 24 May 2004.
Outbreaks:
Location: Aquitaine region, Gironde department (in the south-western part
of the country)
No. of outbreaks: 1
Description of affected population: a crossbred hound puppy, aged about 6
months. The animal had no identification and was not vaccinated against rabies.
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
species / susceptible / cases / deaths / destroyed / slaughtered
can / 12 / 1 / 1 / 11 / 0
fel / 9 / 0 / 0 / 9 / 0
Diagnosis: the animal was taken to a veterinarian on 13 May 2004. As it
showed clinical signs compatible with rabies (nervous signs, altered
general condition, difficulty in feeding), the veterinarian immediately
isolated the animal and reported the facts to the Departmental Veterinary
Services Directorate (DDSV(1)). The animal died on 15 May at the veterinary
surgery, situated at Pineuilh (Gironde department). A sample was taken and
sent to the laboratory on 18 May 2004.
A. Laboratory where diagnosis was made: AFSSA(2), Nancy (national reference
laboratory).
B. Diagnostic tests used: immunofluorescence tests.
C. Causal agent: African strain of canine lyssavirus, of Moroccan origin
(Africa 1a - Morocco), closely related to the strain isolated in a dog
illegally imported into France and diagnosed as rabid on 3 Feb 2004 (see
Disease Information, 17 [8], 50, dated 20 Feb 2004).
Epidemiology:
A. Source of agent / origin of infection: illegal importation into the
European Union. The owner was given the dog on 8 May 2004 in a Moroccan
village near the Spanish enclave of Ceuta.
B. Other epidemiological details:
The animal, and its owner, entered the European Union at Ceuta (Spain) on
10 May 2004, without undergoing the necessary veterinary or customs
control. The puppy, confined to its owner's car, passed through Spain on 10
and 11 May 2004, along the following route: Algeciras, Malaga, Madrid,
Burgos, Vitoria, San Sebastian. The itinerary in France, from 11 - 13 May
2004, involved the following departments: Pyrenees-Atlantiques, Landes,
Lot-et-Garonne, Lot, and Gironde.
Following the diagnosis of rabies, an epidemiological investigation was
carried out in France by the DDSV and the Departmental Health and Social
Services Directorate (DDASS(3)) in the departments involved, with the help
of the national police force (Gendarmerie), to obtain details of persons,
or animals, that could have come into contact with the infected animal
during the period from 11 - 15 May 2004. These investigations enabled all
such persons, and animals, to be traced.
Control measures:
- In accordance with the regulations in force, the 11 dogs and 9 cats that
were not already vaccinated against rabies at the time of contamination,
or, did not comply with the protocol exempting a contaminated animal from
being killed, were euthanized. The tests performed on these animals were
all negative for rabies.
- All the persons who had been in contact with the puppy in France were
directed to their nearest anti-rabies treatment center, notably the center
in Bordeaux, Gironde department.
- The person who had given the puppy in Morocco was identified. The
Moroccan veterinary authorities were informed of the person's name and
address to enable treatment to be given in an anti-rabies center in Morocco.

[Some of the previous reports were posted as Alert Messages in the OIE
system, and, additionally, appeared to be more urgent. Nevertheless, anyone
who might have been exposed along the route that this dog traveled should
consult an anti-rabies treatment center to determine the appropriate course
of action. - Mod.PC]
