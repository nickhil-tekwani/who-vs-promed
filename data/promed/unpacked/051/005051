State Confirms 14 Cases of New Swine Flu Strain
-----------------------------------------
Just 2 weeks ago, the state Department of Health Services [DHS] reported Wisconsin's 1st human case of a new strain of swine flu. Now, 14 people have been documented with the H3N2 [i.e., presumably this means A(H3N2)v] influenza virus infection. All of the cases were in people who were near pigs at the Wisconsin State Fair, or at county fairs in Kenosha, Dodge and Manitowoc counties. Most of the cases are in children. The DHS says everyone who was sickened is recovering. One child had to be hospitalised briefly.

Symptoms of infection are similar to seasonal flu, and include fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing. State Health Officer Henry Anderson is recommending that older adults, pregnant women, young children, and people with weakened immune systems or chronic medical conditions avoid entering swine barns at fairs this year.

The fair season runs until the middle of September.

[A(H3N2)v influenza virus infection in pigs appears to be common throughout much of the United States. Human cases are being reported predominately in children, where there is exposure to apparently healthy animals. The human infections so far have only been accompanied by mild illness. with little onward transmission of infection in the human population.
