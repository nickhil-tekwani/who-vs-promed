Pet rabbit owners in the ACT [Australian Capital Territory] have been warned that a new strain of the deadly rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), commonly known as calicivirus, has been detected in the Territory.

Issuing the warning, Biosecurity Veterinary Officer, Territory and Municipal Services, Wendy Townsend said there were precautions rabbit owners could take to protect their pets. "The new strain of RHDV, called RHDV-2, is similar to all other strains of the virus and spreads easily between rabbits. No strain of RHDV has ever been associated with disease in humans," Dr Townsend said.

"The infected rabbit was found by a research group that carries out routine monitoring of rabbit diseases. This is an isolated incident and further cases of infection with this virus have not yet been reported."

She said the virus could spread through contact with infected rabbits, objects that an infected rabbit had touched such as rabbit food, bedding, brushes and clothing/footwear. The virus could also be spread by blood-sucking insects such as mosquitoes, biting flies, lice and mites. "You can help protect your pet rabbit by ensuring your fences are secure so your pet cannot leave your yard and wild rabbits cannot enter. Keep your rabbit's house clean and when you replace the hay or ground cover use fresh, clean material, not material collected outside your yard," Dr Townsend said.

"The most important thing you can do to protect your pet is ensure your rabbit's vaccinations are up to date, and stick to your vaccination program to avoid vaccination gaps." She said a vaccine against this particular virus strain was not yet available, but the current vaccine might offer partial protection and was also likely to slow virus spread in case of an outbreak.

Pet rabbits are becoming more numerous as household pets. They are inquisitive, interesting pets that have an aptitude for getting into trouble. They love to chew, and will chew on most anything, including computer cords and cables. That warning being said, they can make charming pets.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) in adult European rabbits (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) [the strain that was introuced into the wild in Australia - Mpd.JW] is caused by Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV; genus _Lagovirus_, family _Caliciviridae_), a virus with a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of 7.4 kb. First described in China in 1984, the virus rapidly spread worldwide and is nowadays considered as endemic in several countries. In Australia and New Zealand where rabbits are pests, RHDV was purposely introduced for rabbit biocontrol. Factors that may have precipitated RHD emergence remain unclear, but non-pathogenic strains seem to pre-date the appearance of the pathogenic strains suggesting a key role for the comprehension of the virus origins.

All pathogenic strains are classified within one single serotype, but 2 subtypes are recognised, RHDV and RHDVa. RHD causes high mortality in both domestic and wild adult animals, with individuals succumbing between 48-72 h post-infection. No other species has been reported to be fatally susceptible to RHD.

The disease is characterised by acute necrotising hepatitis, but haemorrhages may also be found in other organs, in particular the lungs, heart, and kidneys due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. Resistance to the disease might be explained in part by genetically determined absence or weak expression of attachment factors, but humoral immunity is also important.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is rapidly fatal, with mortality rates of 70-100 percent in adult rabbits; young rabbits (kits) are unaffected or subclinically infected. This difference in disease susceptibility is poorly understood, but it may be due to changes in tissue-specific receptors that occur as young rabbits develop to adulthood.

Effective inactivated vaccines prepared from liver extracts of rabbits experimentally infected with classic RHDV strains are used as a prophylactic and postoutbreak strategy to combat disease.

RHDV is not cultivatable in cell culture; therefore, detection of virus genome, virions, and anti-RHDV antibodies and experimental infection of rabbits are required for diagnosis and virus characterization. Sequence regions of the major capsid protein viral protein (VP) 1 are used to type and classify strains.

The identification of rabbit caliciviruses (RCVs), nonpathogenic viruses antigenetically similar to RHDV, and recent descriptions of a pathogenic RCV, an RHDV variant grouping with RCV viruses in phylogenetic analysis, and nonpathogenic RHDV raise questions about the origins, classification, and nomenclature of these viruses. Although the study of RHDV and RHD has been hampered by the lack of an appropriate cell culture system for the virus, several aspects of the replication, epizootology, epidemiology, and evolution have been disclosed.

Disease control in rabbitries relies mainly on vaccination and biosecurity measures. Such measures are difficult to be implemented in wild populations. More recent research has indicated that RHDV might be used as a molecular tool for therapeutic applications.

[Neither RHDVa nor RHDVb is the same as RHDV-2 - rather RHDV-2 is a different strain, but the same pathogen. Maybe the articles immediately above can help clarify this point. - Mod.CRD]
