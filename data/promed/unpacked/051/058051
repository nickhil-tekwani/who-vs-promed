A new case of anthrax in Zagoriche
----------------------------------
High temperatures and lack of electrical power in Takach village have reinforced the villagers' concerns that there will be more cases.

The National Reference Laboratory confirmed one more case of anthrax [presumably a human case] in the Shumen village of Takach.

The village continues to be under quarantine. The problem is compounded by lack of water, said (BNT) Bulgarian National Television. Farmers said that the animals are confined and watering them from local sources is therefore impossible. Even the fountains are dry and the villagers have to collect water in containers. Some even dared face risk by taking their stock to the local reservoir. According to them, although they are under quarantine, the high temperatures and lack of water will sicken their stock.

According to the mayor of the village the offenders were forced by circumstances. People are doing for themselves. No animal can live a day without water, he added.

VS said that the lack of lead during the quarantine is inadmissible. If the circumstances do not improve within 2-3 days in regard to the water the villagers will be forced to protest.

It turns out that high consumption, power failure, and an accident at the pumping station and transmission network led to the water problem in Takach. Concerning the water, the Shumen authorities have promised that the village will have water by the end of the day.

[We are having a problem with these reports from Bulgaria as we have to depend on machine translations from Bulgarian into English. So there are points where one has to depend on intuition for what the true meaning might be. So I apologise to our Bulgarian members for any mistakes and ask that you might volunteer to be on hand when we get future reports needing translation.
