Try:
O'Brien, S. J. The Cheetah is Depauperate in Genetic Variation.
Science. 1983
Sorry, I don't have the complete reference here. There are several papers
by O'Brien and his group discussing the lack of genetic variability in
cheetahs and disease, and some on the Florida panther, _Felis concolor
coryi_ and the potential for similar problems.

Dogs are not wild animals now, but once were. Through selective breeding
over many years, over 120 dog breeds have been created, each with distinct
physical attributes. Unlike any other mammalian species that I am aware
of, the normal adult dog breed size for this one species varies from 2 to
200 lbs. Numerous diseases of genetic origin have been associated with
individual breeds and Dr. Donald Patterson has been working for several
years to catalogue these conditions. However, few of these represent
documented susceptibility to infectious agents.
In 1985, a paper was published titled "Breed-related risk factors for
canine parvovirus infection " (J. Amer. Vet. Med. Assoc., 185:589-594,
1985) in which two dog breeds, the Rottweiler and Doberman Pinscher, were
found to be at significantly increased risk of parvovirus induced
enteritis. To my knowledge, this was the first well-controlled
epidemiologic study to find a canine breed-related susceptibility to an
infectious disease. Fortunately, the canine parvovirus vaccines that
were abvailable at that time were effective in these breeds, but only if
the immunization schedule was intensified, e.g., administering the
vaccine at weekly intervals starting at about 6 weeks of age and
continuing to 20 weeks of age. In contrast, in other dog breeds, two to
three doses of this same vaccine administered two weeks apart gave
protection.
While it is inaccurate to describe the Rottweiler and Doberman Pinscher
breeds as highly inbred, much less clones, dog breeds do reflect genetic
pools more closely related to each other than to other dog breeds. If a
protective vaccine had not been available at the time, it is quite possible
that the emerging canine parvovirus epidemic would have threatened the very
existence of these breeds. Therefore, concerns regarding the threat to highly
inbred (cloned) animals are well taken and should be considered in future
studies. This is not a novel perspective. The concept of hybrid vigor
has been recognized for a long time. To illustrate this point for dogs,
we studied the longevity of different breeds. While longevity increased
as breed size decreased, for any given size, mixed-breed dogs always
seemed to outlive the purebreeds. These findings are in press in the
J. Gerontology.
Hope this sheds some light on your question. Genetic selection for
desireable traits in any species will inevitably give rise to
subpopulations with increased susceptibility to a pathogen. From a
population perspective, one should therefore either avoid inbreeding all
together to maintain hybrid vigor, or ensure genetic diversity by
establishing and maintaining distinct genetic pools.
