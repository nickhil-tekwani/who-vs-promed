5 Deaths in Hepatitis Outbreak in Punjab
--------------------------------------------------
At least 5 people have died in an outbreak of jaundice in the
suburbs of Talagang. Scores of people have been admitted to
public and private hospitals [suffering jaundice]. The hospital
administrations are facing immense problems in dealing with the
dozens of jaundice patients owing to the limited facilities available.
Tehsil Headquarter Hospital (THQ) reportedly had nothing to
control this epidemic in the outskirts of Talagang as the health
administration has been unable to establish the emergency point or
mobile vaccination teams for the patients so far.

[Resort to control by vaccination suggests that this outbreak of
jaundice may be a consequence of hepatitis A virus infection.
However, if contamination of water supplies is the cause of the
outbreak, either hepatitis A virus or hepatitis E virus could be the
etiologic agent.
Hepatitis E virus is prevalent in parts of Pakistan & neighboring India,
and no vaccine is currently available. Further information would be
appreciated concerning the source of the outbreak and the identity of
the infectious agent. - Mod.CP]
[There is always the lurking fear that yellow fever might make its way
to the Indian subcontinent, so identifying the agent of any outbreak of
"jaundice" involving fatalities is important. In this case, the CFR -- case
fatality ratio -- seems low to be YF (5 deaths out of "scores") - Mod.JW]
