Should ProMED-mail adopt journalistic terminology about what it was that
[the suspect was feared to have? Someone in "possession of anthrax"
belongs in a hospital bed, not a jail. The news reports garbled the
disease "anthrax" with its etiologic agent, _Bacillus anthracis_, as well
as confusing bacteria with viruses, bacteria with toxins, and, I believe,
plague with botulism. I suggest that ProMED-mail postings should be
scrupulously precise in its use of words, if only not to mislead the
nonspecialists who follow the list. For example, I wonder how many of them
now think that it is appropriate to write about the "epidemiology" of
diseases in farm animals and wildlife.

[The writer is absolutely correct. I have been hoist on my own petard.
Here I have been the stickler for proper classification and taxonomy and I
let slip through something like this. Our readers should well know that
the name of the etiologic agent is never the name of the disease. In this
case, it isn't even close. This is what comes of moderating at night past
the time when one is fully conscious. Even during the day I am never more
than 80% conscious. Anyway, I apologize. For those friends of mine who
want to gloat over this error, don't. If you stayed up later than 9 PM you
would also sound stupid. For those very few of whom who so kindly took time
from their busy schedules to tell me that I made a mistake calling
Creationism nonsense, I didn't. That was no mistake. - Mod.CHC
