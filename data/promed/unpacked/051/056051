The following background data on salmonellosis in Latvia were
extracted from GIDEON <http://www.GideonOnline.com>:
During 1985 to 2005, the yearly incidence of salmonellosis in Latvia
varied from 306 cases (1987) to 3359 cases (1989)
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/salmonella-latvia.jpg=20>.
Disease rates are similar to those of adjacent countries
<http://exhibit.gideononline.com/salmonella-latvia1.jpg=20>.
Serotype Enteritidis has accounted for approximately 75 to 82 percent
of isolates, and Typhimurium for 9 to 26 percent. The number of
foodborne outbreaks of salmonellosis varies from 7 to over 100 per year.
Notable outbreaks:
1999 - An outbreak (32 cases) of _S._ Enteritidis infection was
caused by contaminated eggs served at a party.
2000 - An outbreak (43 cases) of _S._ Glostrup infection was caused
by contaminated chicken served at a private home.
2001 - An outbreak (19 cases) of _S._Enteritidis PT4 infection was
reported among Finnish tourists to Riga - the incriminated food was
cake with raw egg cream.
