Florida officials today [17 May 2006] are reporting that they once again
have positive finds of ASR on kudzu in the northern part of the state. "We
have had several days of rain after a prolonged dry period, and we expect
the disease to continue to increase if the rains continue," the state
commentary on <http://www.sbrusa.net> said. "We also are having higher
humidity and a lot of dew, which will encourage disease as well. The kudzu
canopy is fully developed but not flowering yet. All of the soybean
sentinel plots are still negative."
Several dry weeks since the middle of February 2006 had caused the rust,
known to have been present in 11 Florida counties this year, to go dormant.
Officials reported they had not been able to find soybean rust in north
Florida in recent weeks, and no new counties with rust were listed with
today's report.
Soybean rust was confirmed on kudzu in Alachua, Duval, Gadsden, Hernando,
Hillsborough, Lee, Leon, Marion, Miami-Dade, Pasco and Polk counties in
Florida in 2006 thus far, with 7 of the 10 finds reported on 17 Jan; one on
20 Jan (Marion) and the most recent on 13 Feb in Miami-Dade, a full 3
months ago.

this year with a new mobile rust alert service.
Through <http://www.SoyRAP.com>, ASA's online resource for soybean rust
news and information, ASA members can register for free to receive a brief
call when the USDA confirms soybeanrust in a nearby region. Subscribers may
designate one or more of 5 regions for their alerts.
The SoyRAP.com mobile rust alert service is an exclusive ASA member benefit
that is designed to help soybean growers manage rust. Non-ASA members can
sign up for the service for USD 25.
SoyRAP.com is sponsored by BASF Corporation, Bayer CropScience and Syngenta
Crop Protection. The mobile soybeanrust alert service will begin on Fri 2

[3] Update to public ASR website

The USDA public soybean rust Web site is now the "USDA Public PIPE Mapping
Web site," and it's not just for rust anymore.
PIPE stands for the new Pest Information Platform for Extension and
Education, the creation of which was announced in late October 2005, when
the USDA announced renewed funding to expand and refine the soybean rust
tracking effort -- and more.
The "and more" came to pass [on 1 May 2006], when the platform's new
pest-specific interface for soybean aphids and many new features and tools
for the soybean-rust interface were added. Now both soybean rust and
soybean aphids will be tracked at <http://www.sbrusa.net>, in a system and
format with room to add more crops and more pests in the future. For now,
the one category of host plants being monitored is called "legumes/kudzu,"
which, of course, emphasizes soybeans as before.
The web address stays the same; but "USDA Public PIPE Website" is what will
show in your browser heading and lists.
"Getting Started" is the first place to head when you get to the new PIPE
site -- click on the small gray box in the upper left corner. There is so
much new information and so many new tools on the site that the "Getting
Started" documents print out as nearly 5 pages each, double-spaced -- one
for rust, the other for aphids.
The USDA's Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service;
Risk Management Agency; and the Animal Plant Health Inspection Service have
worked together to implement the system. CSREES manages its part of the
system through its land-grant university partners, the Cooperative
Extension System, the Regional Integrated Pest Management Centers, and the
National Plant Diagnostic Network.

[4] ASR predictions for 2006
Date: 28 Apr 2006
From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>

After a flurry of confirmed Asian soybean rust findings in January and
February, no new findings of the disease have been reported since the first
week of March, according to USDAï¿½s Soybean Rust website
(<http://www.sbrusa.net>).
But that doesn't mean US soybean farmers are out of the woods, yet, says XB
Yang, extension plant pathologist at Iowa State University, who is
considered one of the top US experts on Asian soybean rust. Yang says 2006
is shaping up to be a more active year for soybean rust because of warmer
conditions and forecasts for normal rainfall along the Gulf Coast. On
average for those months (March, April, May), Louisiana and Mississippi
have plentiful rain and cloudy days for rust development, he said. With the
current situation, rust is likely to have more activity in the South unless
there is something in the biological information we do not know about.
Speaking at a Plant Health Seminar in Orlando, Yang noted that in 2006 the
map (on the USDA website) has already reached the level of activity of June
2005, which does not bode well for soybean farmers.
Yang said scientists believe they have found some answers as to why rust
moved so slowly in 2005. One involves kudzu, which was expected to be the
bell cow that would tip off researchers to the movement of rust in the
south east and Delta states. Instead, researchers are finding that the US
version of soybean rust, at least, appears to develop more slowly than
anticipated on kudzu. "Under trees, the kudzu was intensively infested with
kudzu. But, on the other side of the road, where there were no trees, the
disease was very light. We found the same situation in Alabama. When the
kudzu was out of the shade, the disease did not appear to move much, and
that may help explain why the disease may not be progressing well on kudzu."
Research at the University of Minnesota shows, on the other hand, that
farmers in the Mid-South and the Midwest may have had a near miss with
Asian soybean rust at some point in the 2006 growing season.
In the study funded by the United Soybean Board, Minnesota researchers
collected rainfall samples and used DNA testing to determine if they
contained Asian soybean rust spores. The researchers used computer models
of the wind currents and tracked those rain samples back to potential
sources. "They think these spores that were found in North Dakota came from
Mexico and not from Florida or the other places," Yang said. This is still
being debated and will have to be tested further.
Yang told participants at the seminar, which was sponsored by BASF, that
the record warm temperatures this past winter probably contributed to the
increased findings of Asian soybean rust in Alabama, Florida, Georgia and
Texas earlier in 2006. "For this reason, we could be likely to see more
activity in the spring in the South."
The long-range forecast is for the Midwest states to have normal rainfall
this spring and into the summer. If that forecast pans out, those states
would have a lower probability of a soybean rust epidemic, says Yang,
because normal rainfall does not normally mean abundant rainfall [which
drives epidemics of ASR - Mod.JAD] for those states.
That tells us that even if we have a lot of spores blown into the area, the
risk of an outbreak is not very high because the normal rainfall would not
be favorable for rust development.

[Asian soybean rust (ASR)is a plant disease caused by the fungus
_Phakopsora pachyrhizi_ and was introduced into the USA in 2004. In
addition to the crop plant soybean (_Glycine max_), cowpeas, green beans,
and other edible legumes could be affected by the ASR pathogen which causes
defoliation and yield reduction. Kudzu (_Pueraria lobata_, a.k.a. Japanese
arrowroot) is an important alternate host for the pathogen in southern
states of the USA.
There have been no new reports of ASR in the USA since late Feb 2006. This
includes kudzu and the new 2006 sentinel plots of soybean, both of which
are watched closely. Dry weather is given as the reason for this hiatus,
especially in Florida where earlier finds of ASR on kudzu were frequent in
Jan and Feb 2006. Item [1] reports that rain in early May 2006 in northern
Florida has resulted in a new emergence of ASR on kudzu, found 17 May 2006.
No new counties besides the 11 in which ASR was reported earlier in the
year have been added to the list of known sites of ASR in 2006.
I [Mod.JAD] have used this opportunity to add 4 other items that came to my
attention since the 3rd posting in the 2006 series on ASR (20060226.0622).
Item [2] describes an alert for ASR that can be sent directly to a cell
phone, which may be of interest to some subscribers. Item [3] announces new
features and updates to the federal website (<http://www.sbrusa.net>) that
monitors and maps ASR in the USA. Item [4] caught my attention as a good
prediction of ASR for 2006, which has been condensed for ProMED-mail. Dr
Yang, who is quoted in the article, notes that though ASR got off to a good
start this year in southern states, it may not spread so well from kudzu to
kudzu once it is out of deep shade, and that it will take above-average
rainfall to drive epidemics. The original article is recommended. Item [5]
announces a USA meeting on ASR organized by the American Phytopathological
Society to be held Nov 29 to Dec 1 2006. A website added under "More links
on ASR" contains a good online slideshow about ASR.
