Russia: Rubella outbreak in Kamchatka
-------------------------------------
The number of people who have contracted rubella has risen to 73 in
the village of Sobolevo in the Kamchatskiy region. 68 of them are
children. According to the Deyta.ru News Agency, another 2 cases of
rubella have been reported in a neighboring village. The source of
infection is reported to be a child from Vladivostok attending the
"Ocean" summer camp. According to the chief of the Sanitary
Epidemiological center, the situation began to stabilize when 130
dozes of vaccine were delivered several days ago. The late delivery
of this vaccine is partially responsible for the rise in the number
of cases. Currently, the 2 villages have been placed under quarantine.
