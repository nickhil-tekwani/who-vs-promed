Lusambo, Congo DR: 30 suspected cases of cholera recorded

[re: ProMED-mail Ebola update (48): Congo DR, MSF, susp. deaths, RFI 20180703.5886426]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
While the source (https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-39783_sankuru_trois_deces_dus_a_une_diarrhee_d_origine_inconnue_a_lusambo.html) cited in [the post referenced above] indicates a possible Ebola virus disease outbreak, the following report rather suggests an outbreak of cholera.

Translated from original French text by Radio Okapi published on 2 Jul 2018 (https://www.radiookapi.net/2018/07/02/actualite/en-bref/lusambo-30-cas-suspects-de-cholera-enregistres, edited):

"Suspected cases of cholera have been detected in the Lusambo health zone in Sankuru [district, Kasai-Oriental province] for 2 weeks. As of [Sat 30 Jun 2018], 30 cases have been reported, including 7 deaths.

Lusambo Chief Medical Officer of Health, Willy Kidinda, said it would be cholera because of trade between the locality of Bena Dibele [Sankuru district] and the city of Mbuji-Mayi [capital city of Kasai-Oriental province], 2 [communities] where the disease is already rife.

We are [at] 30 cases, until last night [1 Jul 2018]. We are in full preparations for sending the samples to the INRB [National Institute of Biomedical Research], because the sampling materials are en route coming, "said the doctor."

Contrary to this, there are 2 statements in the 1st source above (https://www.mediacongo.net/article-actualite-39783_sankuru_trois_deces_dus_a_une_diarrhee_d_origine_inconnue_a_lusambo.html), published on 2 Jul 2018, translated from original French text) which are ambiguous (1) or false (2):

1. "Samples of this bloody and deadly diarrhea, it has been reported, are already being sent to the National Institute for Biochemical Research, INRB, in Kinshasa for analysis."

2. "Sankuru province shares borders with the former(?) province of Equateur, where the Ebola epidemic had recently erupted."

Regarding (1) it is not clear, if the description of the samples as "bloody and deadly diarrhea" either:
a. refers to actual clinical symptoms observed in patients of Lusambo health zone, or
b. is one of the commonly used phrases in media when characterizing Ebola virus disease, which is actually misleading. Since the huge number of cases recorded during the epidemic in West Africa 2014-16 it is common consensus among Ebola clinicians that "bleeding" is much rarer in patients than described before.

However, one of the typical signs of cholera is non-bloody watery diarrhea, which distinguishes it from differential diagnoses for other also bacterial but bloody diarrhea caused by for example, _Shigella_, _Salmonella_, _Campylobacter_, or _Yersinia_ species.

Of course, this is all speculative, while the definitive laboratory diagnosis of the samples sent to the National Institute for Biochemical Research, INRB, in Kinshasa is still pending.

Regarding (2) the provinces of Sankuru and Equateur are rather distant and do not share a border, as displayed in the map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_the_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo#/media/File:2006_Nouvelles_provinces_de_la_R%C3%A9publique_D%C3%A9mocratique_du_Congo.png.

Here we share a map visualizing the geographic clustering of Ebola virus disease cases in the western province of Equateur and the confirmed or suspected cases of cholera in the cities Mbuji-Mayi and Bena Dibele as well as the location of the undiagnosed diarrhea outbreak Lusambo in the central region of DRC: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zk9NnlkNPt9y2EpCp47yfdBoTET2ouE2&usp=sharing.

[ProMED thanks Dr Kopp for submitting this clarification of the likely cause of the cases of diarrhea in DRC. According to the UN Children's Fund, the DRC has experienced an increase in the number of cases of cholera, which are mostly reported from the west provinces. The DRC had the highest number of cases reported from 1 Aug 2017-24 Mar 2018 (see report published in DirectRelief, https://www.directrelief.org/2018/04/emergency-response-mapping-cholera-hot-spots-in-africa/ entitled Emergency Response: Mapping Cholera Hot Spots in Africa, A Schroeder 10 Apr 2018.)

The UN is making a global push to reduce cholera deaths by 90 percent by 2030. In the 15 years between 1997 and 2012 just 1.5 million doses of cholera vaccines were used worldwide. In 2017 alone almost 11 million were used, from Sierra Leone to Somalia to Bangladesh. In the 1st 4 months of 2018 over 15 million doses have already been approved for use worldwide.

"This is an unprecedented response to a spike in cholera outbreaks across Africa," said Dr Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. "We have worked hard to ensure there is now enough vaccine supply to keep the global stockpile topped up and ready for most eventualities. However with more and more people now succumbing to this terrible, preventable disease, the need for improved water and sanitation -- the only long-term, sustainable solution to cholera outbreaks - has never been clearer." (http://www.who.int/news-room/detail/07-05-2018-largest-cholera-vaccine-drive-in-history-to-target-spike-in-outbreaks).

We await the definitive laboratory diagnosis. Diagnosis by symptoms can be difficult, although that, together with the number of cases of cholera in the region, seems suggestive. - Mod.LK

[2] Preparedness for Ebola and other infectious diseases
Date: Tue 3 Jul 2018

UK steps up fight against Ebola following outbreak in Democratic Republic of Congo
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Minister for Africa Harriett Baldwin has announced extra support to help protect African countries against the spread of Ebola and other deadly diseases.

The UK is backing the World Health Organisation's (WHO's) Regional Preparedness Plan to support 9 countries at high risk of receiving cases of Ebola from their neighbour, the Democratic Republic Congo (DRC).

UK aid's of GBP 1.5 million [about USD 2 million] of support will enable WHO to support countries with prevention, detection and containment of Ebola and other deadly diseases. It will also help important work being done at the community level, such as working with traditional healers, health workers and religious leaders around issues including safe and dignified burials. This will lead to an increased number of referrals of those with symptoms in harder to reach areas.

This new funding will help stop the immediate spread of the current DRC outbreak as well as build longer term resilience and follows significant support already committed by the International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt in May. To date, the UK response has helped to stabilise the outbreak, but the threat of it spreading to other countries remains.

Minister for Africa, Harriett Baldwin said:
"The UK continues to act decisively to stop this outbreak of Ebola, an horrific contagious disease which has the potential to cause devastating loss of life.

"By supporting the WHO's Regional Preparedness Plan, UK aid will help to scale up preparedness to ensure sustainability. We are not just waiting for the next outbreak to come along, but are actively working in partnership around the world to strengthen health systems. This is keeping us all safe from current and future global health emergencies.

"The UK has the resources and know-how to help contain the spread of epidemics, but there is still work to do. Outbreaks are inevitable but epidemics are preventable.

Dr Ibrahima-Soce Fall, WHO Regional Emergencies Director, said:
"Investing in preparedness is crucial to keep the world safe from Ebola. WHO is grateful for this additional funding from UK aid, which will support 9 countries to better prevent, detect and respond to this deadly virus.

"The UK continues to be a global leader in the fight against deadly diseases like Ebola and support to WHO reform in Africa has helped bring about a swifter and better-coordinated response to the outbreak in the DRC, a sharp contrast to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.

Notes to Editors
----------------
WHO's Regional Preparedness and Readiness Plan aims to fill gaps identified by recent assessments. The estimated budget for the plan (June 2018-February 2019) is USD 15.5 million over 9 months. The plan is divided into 2 phases of priority actions. Phase I will be implemented in the next 3 months and will bolster operational readiness should there be any importation of Ebola cases. Phase II will look at the scale up of preparedness actions to ensure sustainability over the longer term.

This GBP 1.5 million [about USD 2 million] of new funding support is taken from DFID's [Department for International Development] Crisis Reserve, and is being provided immediately to the World Health Organisation's response plan for at least the next 3 months.

It comes after a previous GBP 5 million [about USD 6.6 million] support was provided to the World Health Organisation's response plan in May 2018.

The Crisis Reserve funding is in addition to GBP 1 million [about USD 1.3 million] which DFID made available from its joint research initiative on epidemic preparedness with Wellcome. Wellcome has also made a further GBP 2 million [about USD 2.6 million] available to deal with the Ebola outbreak, which is being used to help roll out the vaccine campaign.

The UK's response to Ebola in 2014 represented a great success in preventing the spread of a killer disease that threatened to reach 1.4 million cases. However, it came at significant cost to the UK taxpayer and African economies which lost at least USD 1.6 billion. Following previous DFID programmes (Regional Preparedness Programme and the Regional Malaria Programme, notably) the new Tackling Deadly Diseases in Africa Programme (TDDAP) aims to save lives and reduce the impact of disease outbreaks on African populations. This includes support to the reform of WHO in the Africa region, where it is already showing progress through swifter, better-coordinated outbreak responses in the DRC and Madagascar.

Investing in health systems early is important and good value for money, because it enhances the world's ability to prevent epidemics, rather than reacting to the next crisis. Evidence suggests that for every GBP 1 [about USD 1.32] invested in preparation a GBP 2 [about USD 2.65] return can be achieved in terms of savings on future spending and investments.

Public Health England has assessed the risk of this outbreak to the UK as negligible to very low.
