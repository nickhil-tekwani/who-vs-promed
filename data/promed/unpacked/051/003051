Man shows symptoms of killer virus
----------------------------------
A Malawian man who was admitted to the Life Fourways Clinic with symptoms
of viral haemorrhagic fever is undergoing blood tests, Talk Radio 702 reports.

The move is a precautionary measure at this stage. The hospital has assured
the public the 55-year-old has been properly isolated, according to the report.

When contacted by The Times website this morning, the hospital was not
immediately available for comment.

[Insufficient information is provided to evaluate this report precisely,
but it is likely that the patient is suspected to have contracted the novel
arenavirus haemorrhagic fever responsible for a recent outbreak in Zambia
(see ProMED-mail Archive references below). A new type of arenavirus has
been identified by experts at the National Institute for Communicable
Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg as they studied the virus that caused the
deaths of 4 people in recent weeks. Result of the diagnostic tests are awaited.

Malawi lies to the east of Zambia and can be located using the
