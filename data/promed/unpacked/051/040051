DRC: epidemic in diamond area identified as pneumonic plague
------------------------------------------------------------
At least 38 people have died, and at least 1300 others are diagnosed with a
disease that the UK-based medical NGO Merlin calls a highly contagious form
of pneumonic plague, which broke out in July 2005 in the remote diamond
mining area of Libaku ya Suka in the Democratic Republic of Congo's eastern
Maniema Province.
The disease has a high fatality rate, Merlin said in a statement released
on Fri 2 Sep 2005. Those infected suffer from high fever and acute
shortness of breath as well as chest pains, headaches and swollen lymph glands.
Pneumonic plague is a bacterial infection of the lungs and can be easily
transmitted from human to human through infected air droplets, infected
clothing or other contaminated articles, Merlin said.
The disease can be treated with antibiotics if identified early enough, but
Merlin's head nurse, Prosper Tunda, at Libaku ya Suka, said that hospitals
and health centers in the area were not equipped to deal with this kind of
emergency. Patients are lying on the floor, as there are not enough beds or
mattresses, and all the health facilities lack basic equipment and
essentials drugs," Tunda said.
The Merlin team is working with other organizations in the area and local
health staff to identify and treat new cases in the Punia, Lubutu and
Obokote districts of the province. Efforts to quarantine infected people is
difficult, Merlin said, because many of them are working at an open diamond
mine in poor sanitary conditions in close proximity to some 8000 other miners.

[Some cases may well be pneumonic plague, but it would seem extremely
unlikely that the large outbreak involving more than 1300 individuals is
due to _Y. pestis_ pneumonia, primary or secondary, unless the strain is
much less virulent than usual. - Mod.LL]
