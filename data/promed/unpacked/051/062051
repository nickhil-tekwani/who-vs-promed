Mauritius
- National. 22 Apr 2019. In total, there are 75 people infected with the dengue virus. During the weekend, a 1st case of dengue fever type 2 was recorded in a 3-year-old child. He is currently hospitalized in a Plaines-Wilhems clinic. "We have not yet done any analysis to find out how this type 2 dengue case happened in Mauritius. It will be done in the coming days," says the Ministry of Health.

What is certain, however, is that of the 75 cases identified, at least 4 cases were imported. At the Ministry of Health, it is said to be certain that these people were infected in India and Reunion. "Moreover, the dengue virus type 2 is prevalent in Reunion," says one.

[2] Research - Mapping out structure of Dengue and Zika viruses for developing treatments
Date: 27 Apr 2019

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/advances-in-singapores-zika-and-dengue-fight


Singapore scientists have succeeded in mapping out the structures of the dengue and Zika virus strains, a crucial milestone in the development of treatments for the potentially deadly diseases.

Researchers from A-Star's (Agency for Science, Technology and Research) Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS), together with scientists from Duke-NUS Medical School and A*Star's Bioinformatics Institute mapped the long genetic materials of 4 dengue and 4 Zika virus strains. They studied the viruses' activities and vital parts to identify portions of their genetic material that could be targeted for treatments.

Dr Wan Yue, a principal investigator at GIS and lead author of the study, said: "One needs to understand the shape and mechanism of a lock in order to design a key that can open it. Similarly, mapping the shapes and structures of the dengue and Zika viruses will boost understanding of their biology, and contribute significantly towards designing drug treatments targeted at these viruses."

Both dengue and Zika are flaviviruses spread by the _Aedes_ mosquito. There are no effective treatments for either disease.

Singapore is a major dengue hot spot, and 2457 dengue fever cases were reported in the 1st 3.5 months of the year -- more than 3 times the number in the same period last year [2018] -- with 3 deaths.

Worldwide, the incidence of dengue has grown dramatically, with some researchers estimating 390 million dengue infections a year.

In another effort that will help boost disease management and control, scientists from A-Star -- in collaboration with the Environmental Health Institute of the National Environment Agency, and the National Centre for Infectious Diseases -- have developed a test to detect and differentiate between multiple vector-borne flaviviruses, including dengue and Zika, at the same time.

The technique has the potential to be developed into a diagnostic tool that can screen for multiple flaviviral infections using a small volume of blood in a single test, the researchers believe. The protein-based test works by tracking a particular protein -- nonstructural protein 1 -- which is secreted by each flavivirus and is unique to each. Currently, each flavivirus diagnosis requires a specific test, said A-Star, and even if the samples can be combined, this tends to compromise detection sensitivity.

Dr Heidi Brown, assistant professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Arizona, said that the capacity of the new test to distinguish the types of viruses present in a small sample would have implications for understanding outbreaks that take place around the same time. She cited the concurrent outbreaks of the chikungunya and Zika virus, which took place in the Western Hemisphere in overlapping succession, as an example.
