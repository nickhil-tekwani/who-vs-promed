The provincial health department says a farmer and professional hunter from
Adelaide in the Eastern Cape is in a critical condition after being
diagnosed with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said on Tuesday [15 Jul 2008] that the man, 39,
was admitted to the Adelaide hospital on 12 Jul 2008 and transferred to St
George's private hospital in Port Elizabeth the next day. The department
planned to move him to the state-run Livingstone hospital in the city,
where there was a specialised isolation unit. "His situation is extremely
serious, and he's in a critical condition," Kupelo said.

The diagnosis, received from the National Institute for Communicable
Disease (NICD) this week, was preliminary, and confirmation would be
available on Wednesday [16 Jul 2008]. The viral disease [CCHF], transmitted
to humans by ticks or contact with blood or tissue from infected animals,
is potentially fatal.

Kupelo said the man was reportedly bitten by a tick on 3 Jul 2008 and went
to see a doctor for the 1st time 4 days later. Three days after that, he
developed a range of typical fever symptoms, including nausea, vomiting,
and joint pains. The department was sending an outbreak response team to
the Adelaide area to trace the man's contacts and check what medical
assistance might be necessary.

CCHF is the commonest of a range of hemorrhagic fevers that occur in South
Africa. According to the NICD, anywhere between 5 and 25 cases are reported
each year, most of them in the Karoo, the Western Free State, the Northern
Cape and North West Province. Most of the sufferers are farmers, farm
laborers, hunters or abattoir workers.

Symptoms include fever, aching muscles, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness,
headache, sore eyes, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, nose bleeding, and
other non-normal bleeding. According to the World Health Organization, one
in 3 sufferers dies from the disease. There is no safe and effective
vaccine widely available for human use.
