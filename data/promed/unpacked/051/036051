ConAgra Foods Inc. told consumers to discard certain jars of Peter
Pan and Great Value peanut butter after the spread was linked to a
salmonella outbreak that has sickened almost 300 people nationwide.
Lids of jars with a product code beginning "2111" can be returned to
ConAgra for a refund, the company said.

The salmonella outbreak, which federal health officials said Wed 14
Feb 2007 has sickened 288 people in 39 states since August 2006, was
linked to tainted peanut butter produced by ConAgra at a plant in
Sylvester, Georgia. How salmonella got into peanut butter is still
under investigation, said Dr. Mike Lynch, an epidemiologist at the
CDC.

CDC officials believe the salmonella outbreak to be the nation's 1st
stemming from peanut butter. The most cases were reported in New
York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Tennessee and Missouri.

About 20 percent of all the ill patients were hospitalized, and there
were no deaths, Lynch said. About 85 percent of the infected people
said they ate peanut butter, CDC officials said.

ConAgra officials haven't said how much peanut butter is covered in
the recall. The Peter Pan brand is sold in 10 varieties, according to
ConAgra's website. The Great Value brand, which is also made by other
companies, is a Wal-Mart brand.

The outbreak began in August 2006, with no more than 2 cases reported
each day, CDC officials said. Only in the past few days did
investigators hone in on peanut butter as a source, Lynch said.

Other states reporting cases are Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana,
Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Nebraska, New
Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South
Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and West Virginia.

The recall does not affect Great Value peanut butter made by other
manufacturers, the FDA said.
