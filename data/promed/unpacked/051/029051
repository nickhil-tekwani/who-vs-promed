Hep A outbreak sparks warning
------------------------
An outbreak of hepatitis A spanning 3 states has prompted a federal
public health warning.
The Communicable Diseases Network Australia (CDNA) said 6 [cases]
from Tasmania, 2 from Victoria, and 2 from Queensland were believed
to have been exposed to the liver virus while on tour in the Northern
Territory from 24 to 27 Apr 2003.
Hundreds more may have been exposed to the disease, which is spread
through person-to-person contact or from water or food that has been
inadvertently contaminated by an infected person.
"Tasmania has the largest proportion of cases so far following a
visit to the Northern Territory by a large group of people that
included 106 from Tasmania," CDNA deputy chair Dr Vicki Krause said
in a statement. "There were 300 people in the touring group, and
attempts have already been made to get written information to them
about the signs and symptoms of hepatitis A. In Tasmania, the Public
and Environmental Health Service is investigating the cases of
hepatitis A and all close contacts of each of the cases is being
offered preventative immunisation."
Tasmanian public health director Dr Roscoe Taylor said the hepatitis
A virus infected and inflamed the liver. Symptoms included nausea,
muscle aches and pains, fever, loss of appetite, and jaundice --
yellowing of the eyeballs, skin, and urine. "The incubation period
is usually about a month, but it can range from 15 to 50 days," Dr
Taylor said. He said it was rarely fatal and victims usually made a
full recovery and did not require hospitalisation.
"It tends to be a more significant problem if the victim is older, or
has an underlying immunity problem or a pre-existing liver
condition," he said.
"We are progressively eliminating common sources (among the victims).
They haven't given it to each other, but have acquired it from
something or someone else."
The incidence of hepatitis A, which is usually more common in
travellers returning from overseas, has declined in Australia over
the decades with general improvements to hygiene.
Dr Taylor said he had been working with the Northern Territory health
authorities to track the source as well as with authorities in
Victoria and Queensland on identifying other possible cases.
Anyone who is concerned should contact their [general practitioner] GP.

[Hepatitis A virus (HAV) transmission is via the fecal-oral route,
with person-to-person contact and contaminated food and/or water the
source of infection. Foodborne transmission is frequently associated
with harvesting of produce or preparation of uncooked foods by an
infected person. The 1997 outbreak of Hepatitis A in Australia (NSW)
reported in ProMED-mail (see reference below) was associated with
eating raw oysters. Other outbreaks in Australia have been observed
among men who have sex with men and among those who use illicit drugs.
There is now an effective vaccine against Hepatitis A, but this is
for primary prevention. For post-exposure, immunoglobulin G (IG) is
given as a passive transfer of antibody. When administered within 2
weeks following an exposure to HAV, IG is greater than 85 percent
effective in preventing hepatitis A. Efficacy is greatest when IG is
administered early in the incubation period; when administered later
in the incubation period, IG often only attenuates the clinical
expression of HAV infection. (See Prevention of Hepatitis A Through
Active or Passive Immunization: MMWR 1 Oct 1999, RR-12 accessible at:
<ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Publications/mmwr/rr/rr4812.pdf>).
The brief description in the article of cases among a returning tour
group with a statement "they haven't given it to each other" suggests
there may have been a common exposure consisting of either
contaminated food or water. ProMED-mail would be interested in
follow-up on the results of the investigation of this outbreak. -
