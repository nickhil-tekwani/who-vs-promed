Anthrax kills 10 bison in MacKenzie Sanctuary, Yellowknife, N.W.T.
------------------------------------------------------------------
An additional 10 more bison have died from an outbreak of anthrax in
the territory. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency lab in Lethbridge,
Alberta, has confirmed the animals, all living in the Mackenzie Bison
Sanctuary, died from the bacteria. It marks the 1st time since 1993
bison have perished from anthrax in the protected region.

Crews from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources found
the 1st dead bison in the sanctuary 13 Aug 2010 and no new carcasses
have been found there since 22 Aug 2010.

The deaths come after 45 bison in the Slave River Lowlands died from
the disease earlier this summer. Crews continue to monitor the areas,
which have been sprayed with a chemical sterilant.

[It's 11 days since the last bison carcass was found. This is 3 more
than in the 1st MS report. The Mackenzie Sanctuary (MS) has some
extensive meadows around the various small lakes so with luck there
are no carcasses hidden away under the trees. This is the end of the
breeding season when the animals come together in significant numbers
and disease spread is easy for feeding flies or inquisitive bulls
checking out sick or dead competitors.

So, tempting fate, I am optimistic that we may have seen all we are
going to see in the MS. Of course if the search team flies out to the
western border of the sanctuary there is a area where late in the
1993 epidemic they found an isolated cluster of dead bison. - Mod.MHJ]
