The World Health Organization expects to identify more cases of monkeypox as it expands surveillance in countries where the disease is not typically found.

As of Saturday [21 May 2022], 92 confirmed cases and 28 suspected cases of monkeypox have been reported from 12 member states that are not endemic for the virus, the UN agency said.

The WHO will provide further guidance and recommendations in coming days for countries on how to mitigate the spread of monkeypox.

"Available information suggests that human-to-human transmission is occurring among people in close physical contact with cases who are symptomatic," the agency added.

Monkeypox is an infectious disease that is usually mild and is endemic in parts of west and central Africa. It is spread by close contact, so it can be relatively easily contained through such measures as self-isolation and hygiene.

"What seems to be happening now is that it has got into the population as a sexual form, as a genital form, and is being spread as are sexually transmitted infections, which has amplified its transmission around the world," WHO official David Heymann, an infectious disease specialist, told Reuters.

Heymann said an international committee of experts met via video conference to look at what needed to be studied about the outbreak and communicated to the public, including whether there is any asymptomatic spread, who are at most risk, and the various routes of transmission.

He said the meeting was convened "because of the urgency of the situation." The committee is not the group that would suggest declaring a public health emergency of international concern, WHO's highest form of alert, which applies to the COVID-19 pandemic.

He said close contact was the key transmission route, as lesions typical of the disease are very infectious. For example, parents caring for sick children are at risk, as are health workers, which is why some countries have started inoculating teams treating monkeypox patients using vaccines for smallpox, a related virus.

Many of the current cases have been identified at sexual health clinics.

Early genomic sequencing of a handful of the cases in Europe has suggested a similarity with the strain that spread in a limited fashion in Britain, Israel, and Singapore in 2018.

Heymann said it was "biologically plausible" the virus had been circulating outside of the countries where it is endemic, but had not led to major outbreaks as a result of COVID-19 lockdowns, social distancing, and travel restrictions.

He stressed that the monkeypox outbreak did not resemble the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic because it does not transmit as easily.

Those who suspect they may have been exposed or who show symptoms including bumpy rash and fever should avoid close contact with others, he said.

"There are vaccines available, but the most important message is, you can protect yourself," he added.

Belgium's 3 confirmed cases of monkeypox have been linked to a large-scale fetish festival in the port city of Antwerp, organisers said Friday [20 May 2022].

Several European countries have reported cases in recent days, and the World Health Organisation is investigating whether some outbreaks spread within the gay community.

In Belgium, the Darklands Festival warned patrons who attended 4 days of parties starting on 5 May [2022] that Belgian authorities had linked 3 cases to the event. So far, Belgium has only publicly confirmed 3 cases.

"There's reason to assume that the virus has been brought in by visitors from abroad to the festival after recent cases in other countries," the festival said on its website. "The Risk Assessment Group of the federal government has asked Darklands to inform its guests about these infections."

Darklands is a ticketed event that describes itself as a collaboration of clubs and organisations employing 150 volunteers and hosting daytime commercial events alongside evening parties.

"The various tribes in the gay fetish community (leather, rubber, army, skinhead, puppies . . .) come together to create a unique spectacle of fetish brotherhood," the site says.

Monkeypox is not usually fatal but often manifests itself through fever, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, exhaustion, and a chickenpox-like rash on the hands and face.

The virus can be transmitted through contact with skin lesions or droplets of bodily fluid from an infected person.

https://nltimes.nl/2022/05/21/second-case-monkeypox-found-netherlands-rivm


The number of monkeypox cases in the Netherlands has risen, and the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) said that "a few patients" have now been found. The virus has also been classified as an A-disease on the advice of the RIVM, which means that infections or suspicions must be reported immediately, according to the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (VWS).

The 2nd positive test result came in on Saturday [21 May 2022], the RIVM reported. On Friday [20 May 2022], for the 1st time in the Netherlands, someone had tested positive for the virus.

People who contract the monkeypox virus may initially experience fever, headache, muscle aches, swollen lymph nodes, chills, and fatigue. After a few days, they also develop a rash. The symptoms disappear within a few weeks. The vast majority of people heal on their own. The virus can be dangerous for people who already have a weakened immune system, for children and for pregnant women.

In recent weeks, the virus had already been detected in Belgium, Germany, France, Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden, the United States, Canada, and Australia. Such a far-reaching spread is unusual for monkeypox virus.

However, according to Professor Chantal Bleeker-Rovers of Radboudumc, the outbreak of monkeypox is "no reason to panic." She does expect that the disease will "require a lot of effort" from RIVM, the GGD "and the entire care chain." The professor, who specializes in infectious disease outbreaks, estimates that the chance of stopping this outbreak is greater than with the coronavirus.

On Twitter, Bleeker-Rovers argued that the virus that causes monkeypox is mainly caused by intensive [interpersonal] contact and only after people have developed symptoms. The bumps that the disease causes on the skin are "very visible and recognizable."

An effective vaccine is also available against monkeypox: vaccines that work against smallpox can also fight this virus. If administered in time to someone who has had contact with a patient, the vaccines can also prevent symptoms or at least lower the risk of serious illness, the professor wrote.

To stop the transmission, it is important that people are aware of the complaints it causes and then go into isolation. The 1st symptoms appear after 5-21 days. Before the blisters and bumps appear on the skin, people suffer from complaints such as fever, headache, back pain, and swollen lymph nodes.

Bleeker-Rovers advised people who have been in contact with a suspected patient who has the disease, or who have been somewhere where infections have developed -- such as the Darklands festival in Belgium -- to contact a doctor with these symptoms. The professor points out that children, pregnant women, and people with a disrupted immune system are at greater risk of complications and death. "Most people recover on their own after 2-4 weeks. They remain contagious until the scabs have dried."

[Interestingly, a 20 May 2022 report submitted by Mary Marshall (<mjm2020@google mail.com>) and Roland Hübner (<roland.hubner@health.fgov.be>) indicates that Belgium has become the 1st country to introduce a compulsory monkeypox quarantine, with 14 countries now recording outbreaks of the viral disease (https://www.joe.co.uk/news/belgium-becomes-first-nation-to-introduce-compulsory-monkeypox-quarantine-337431). A 21 May 2022 report submitted by Roland Hübner indicates that there is now a 4th case in Belgium (https://www.msn.com/fr-be/actualite/other/un-4e-cas-de-la-variole-du-singe-en-belgique-l-ampleur-de-l-%C3%A9pid%C3%A9mie-devient-de-plus-en-plus-claire-r%C3%A9agit-marc-van-ranst/ar-AAXzDk3) (in French).

The dilemma is who and when to vaccinate in situations when the number of cases is small and the virus does not appear to be highly transmissible. - Mod.TY

Switzerland has detected its 1st case of monkeypox in canton Bern, health officials said on Saturday evening [21 May 2022]. The case has been confirmed by the Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH) in a tweet.

"Currently, an accumulation of monkeypox infections is observed in Europe and North America. A 1st case has also been confirmed in Switzerland (Canton Bern)," it said.

As far as it is known, the person in the canton of Bern contracted the virus abroad. The infected person is receiving outpatient treatment and is in isolation at home, the canton said in a statement to External Link on Saturday [21 May 2022]. All contact persons have been informed through contact tracing.

Monkeypox is a rare viral disease transmissible to humans from animals, mainly rodents. The course of the disease is usually mild. There has been an unusual cluster of cases of monkeypox in humans in several European countries and in the United States since the beginning of May [2022]. Swiss neighbours Germany and France have both reported cases.

The FOPH has published an information page link (https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/krankheiten-im-ueberblick/affenpocken.html) on monkeypox, outlining symptoms and treatments.

"The FOPH is monitoring the situation closely in coordination with the ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control) and WHO (World Health Organization)," it said on the page.

Germany has registered its 1st case of monkeypox, the German Armed Forces' Bundeswehr Institute for Microbiology said on Friday [20 May 2022]. The virus was detected this Thursday (19 [May 2022]) in a 26-year-old Brazilian.

He arrived in Germany after a trip from Portugal, via Spain, and had been in Munich for a week, in the south of the country, where he arrived after stints in Düsseldorf and Frankfurt. The patient would have presented skin rashes, one of the characteristic symptoms of the disease. The Brazilian is in isolation at a clinic in the city.

In a statement, the institution points out that health authorities in Europe and North America have been detecting an increasing number of cases of monkeypox since the beginning of March [2022], which raises fears that the disease, usually present only in some regions of the Africa, is spreading.

[This case illustrates the role that international and local travel has in determining patterns of spread of monkeypox (MPX) in this increasing outbreak. It is difficult to determine where this individual may have acquired his infection, but it is unlikely that it was in Germany. Given the man's extensive travel before arrival and during his stay in Germany, identifying all possible contacts would not be possible. It will be interesting to learn if additional cases occur in Germany in coming days. - Mod.TY

In the German capital, 2 people have tested positive for monkeypox a day after Munich registered its 1st case. A surprise outbreak of the rare infectious disease has spread from Europe to the US and the Middle East.

At least 2 people have tested positive for monkeypox in Berlin, authorities said on Saturday [21 May 2022], warning that more cases would likely emerge over the next few days.

The rare infectious disease, which causes distinctive pustules but is rarely fatal, is endemic to parts of Central and Western Africa.

In recent weeks, more than 100 confirmed or suspected cases have been recorded in Europe, as well as the United States, Canada, and Australia.

Health officials in Berlin said the 2 patients were in stable condition. Efforts had begun to trace their contacts.

Public broadcaster RBB said at least one patient was thought to have been infected at a Berlin club.

It is unclear which of the 2 groups (or "clades") of the virus the 2 patients have contracted.

So far, all of the cases registered in Europe are of the milder West African group, rather than the more severe Central African one.

Health authorities said they may have found a 3rd case of the monkeypox virus in the United States and are running tests on a patient in South Florida to confirm if the person has contracted the disease, which is staging a rare outbreak outside of Africa.

The case in Broward County, Florida, is "related to international travel," the US Centers for Disease Control and the Florida Department of Health said in a statement on Sunday [22 May 2022], "and the person remains isolated."

The results of tests conducted by the CDC are expected soon. No other cases have been identified in the state, the release said.

The 1st monkeypox case in the United States was reported in Massachusetts on Wednesday [18 May 2022]. The disease, which is similar to human smallpox but milder, was found in a man who had recently traveled to Canada. Health officials said the case posed no risk to the public.

A New York City resident has tested positive for the virus that causes monkeypox, state health officials announced late Friday [20 May 2022].

The unidentified patient is isolating and treating the case as positive while awaiting final confirmation by the Centers for Disease Control.

New York City public health officials said Thursday [19 May 2022] they were investigating 2 potential cases of monkeypox, a rare virus rarely seen outside of Africa that can cause flu-like symptoms.

Testing ruled out the other case, the state Health Department said.

New York state and city officials will try to determine how the New York patient was infected. City epidemiologists have begun reaching people who may have been in contact with the person.

The virus originates in primates and other wild animals [The reservoir host for monkeypox virus is thought to be African rodents, not primates. - Mod.ML] and causes fever, body aches, chills, and fatigue in most patients. People with severe cases can develop rash and lesions on the face, hands, and other parts of the body.

[11] Infectious period

https://zeenews.india.com/world/monkeypox-patients-could-be-infectious-for-up-to-4-weeks-experts-2465841.html


Health experts have reportedly said that Monkeypox patients could pass on the disease for up to 4 weeks after symptoms appear.

Amesh Adalja, an emerging infectious diseases expert at Johns Hopkins University, made the warning in an interview that monkeypox patients could be infectious for up to 4 weeks, reports the DailyMail.

People who catch the virus initially suffer a fever before rashes and skin lesions appear on the face and body. The virus can then be passed on through touching the affected areas or via droplets expelled in coughs and sneezes.

"It can take a few weeks for the skin lesions to disappear. People are contagious until their active skin lesions have dissipated," he said.

Michael Head, a global health expert at Southampton University in England, agreed with his assertion, the report said.

"Based on previous monkeypox outbreaks and guidance from UK health authorities and WHO, the infectious period (i.e., when the virus can be transmitted to another person) can be comparable to the time period where the rash and blisters are present," Head said. "This may be for 2 weeks, and may be longer," he added.

The month-long infectious period raises the likelihood that the virus could be passed on by infected patients to others.

More than 80 cases of monkeypox have been confirmed in at least 12 countries, the WHO has said. The WHO mentioned another 50 suspected cases are being investigated, without naming any countries, and warned that more cases are likely to be reported.

Infections have been confirmed in 9 European countries as well as the US, Canada, and Australia.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a smallpox drug to treat monkeypox patients, while the WHO revealed it will hold daily meetings as the situation unfolds.

[The 2-4-week period when a monkeypox-virus-infected person can transmit the virus to other ers essentially sets the tie period when that person should be isolated and avoid close physical contact with other people.

Large outbreaks of monkeypox (MPX) are extremely rare, making the current outbreak unusual. In west and central Africa, the only place in the world where the virus is endemic in the wild rodent reservoirs, single cases are most frequently reported. However, a May 1997 report suggested that person-to-person transmission accounted for most monkeypox cases investigated in 1996 and 1997 outbreaks. In contrast, during previous years, reports concerned primarily sporadic cases that resulted from animal-to-human transmission Nevertheless, the current MPX outbreak remains unique due to its widespread geographic distribution and near simultaneous occurrence of cases on 4 continents. - Mod.TY
