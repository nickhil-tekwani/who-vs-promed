Subject: Taiwan Foot and Mouth Outbreak [slaughter begins]
ex South China Morning Post, Internet Edition, 25 Mar 97
Pigs were banned from sale at 19 of 22 wholesale centres throughout Taiwan
yesterday as troops began slaughtering more than 100,000 of the animals to
stop the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. Masked soldiers wearing white
plastic suits and armed with electric prods were shown on Taiwan television
stunning every pig on farms that had been infected. Bulldozers then moved in
to bury the animals in giant pits.
The soldiers were mobilised in a bid to save one of the country's most
important industries after local pork prices plunged by 60 per cent.
Officials hope the slaughter coupled with the temporary trading suspension
in all but three wholesale centres, will ease public fears about
contamination and stabilise prices.
Farming experts are concerned about a possible spread to other livestock,
particularly Taiwan's large herd of dairy cows. The disease, which kills
infected animals, can spread through airborne aerosols. [Pigs produce some 4
logs more airborne virus than cattle so we can soon expect to hear reports
of this disease in dairy herds. MHJ]
It hopes to allow national trading to resume within three days. [Reality
will be otherwise as it takes three to six months to confirm disease and
virus absence in the other farms. MHJ]
Exports were banned as soon as the crisis erupted last Thursday, leaving
farmers facing financial ruin. The agriculture council estimated six
million of the 14 million hogs raised each year in Taiwan were exported,
with Japan being the major buyer.
[This Taiwanese experience should be contrasted with South America which has
a very successful FMD eradication programme; presently Chile, Argentina,
Paraguay, Uruguay, and southern Brasil are free of FMD. It is confidently
expected that all of South America will be confirmed free of FMD by 2003. MHJ]
