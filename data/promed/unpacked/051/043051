Two cages in Traiguen salmon farming centre belonging to Invertec Pesquera Mar de Chiloe (Invermar) and located in the central area of Chiloe island [Los Lagos region] were confirmed as positive for infectious salmon anemia (ISA) virus.

It was reported by the national director of the National Fisheries and Aquaculture Service (Sernapesca), Cecilia Solis Fernandez, under ISA Monitoring and Control Program.

The official said verification samples analyzed in laboratory showed the presence of the virus variant HPR7B.

Solis Fernandez emphasized that rapid detection and confirmation of the outbreak was possible thanks to the programme, which permanently performs the service.

"A sample taken by Sernapesca last week [20-26 Jan 2014] made it possible that by Friday [24 Jan 2014] we had the suspicion of the virus presence," she said. "And the next day we had inspectors detecting the presence of disease-associated signs, and carrying out a 2nd sampling, which today [28 Jan 2014] confirmed the presence of ISA," she added.

Sernapesca director said they are taking all measures of containment referred to in the programme.

In parallel, the Service activated a reinforced surveillance protocol in other farms located in Agrupacion de Concesiones de Salmonicultura (ACS) 9, where Invermar centre is located, as well as in ACS 10.

Sernapesca made clear it would continue to report on the progress regarding this ISA outbreak.

The disease can be systemic and lethal, characterized by severe anemia and hemorrhages in several organs. It is a disease of great economic impact for the salmon industry. The disease is of obligatory notification to the OIE.
