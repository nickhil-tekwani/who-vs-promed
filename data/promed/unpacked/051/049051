Parks Canada continues to monitor an anthrax outbreak in remote areas of Wood Buffalo National Park. The risk to the public remains very low.

- Samples sent to a lab early last week came back positive today [28 Jul 2022], confirming the presence of anthrax in at least one deceased bison.
- Resource conservation staff at Wood Buffalo National Park continue to conduct routine surveillance flights in the park to identify new mortalities and monitor the extent of the outbreak. So far, observed carcasses are located in remote areas of the park and we don't foresee any risk to the public.
- A Parks Canada incident management team (IMT) has been mobilized to assist in the disposal of carcasses at Sweetgrass Station, due to their proximity to facilities at Sweetgrass.
- Additional deceased bison have been observed in the Lake One, Trident Creek/Trident Meadows, Peace Point West Junction, and Flat Grass areas of the park. A total of 59 mortalities have been confirmed and are suspected to be caused by anthrax.

Parks Canada is working closely with relevant provincial, territorial and federal organizations, indigenous governments, local communities, and visitors to ensure the health and safety of the public and park staff are protected. As a precautionary measure, area closures are in place for the Sweetgrass, Trident Creek/Meadows, and Peace Point West Junction areas.

Fort Smith residents are asked to please avoid the Wood Buffalo National Park firebase, located next to the Fort Smith airport, as Parks Canada's IMT works to manage the situation. Additionally, incident personnel are staging operations out of Moose Island (Carlson's Landing) in Wood Buffalo National Park. Helicopters are active in both areas. Please avoid these areas to allow for personnel to safely complete their work.

If you come across a dead animal in the park, do not touch it. Leave the area immediately and report the location to the Wood Buffalo National Park duty officer at (867) 872-0404.

Please be aware of area closures within the park and review attachments accordingly. For up-to-date information on the anthrax outbreak or any temporary closures in Wood Buffalo National Park, please go to https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/nt/woodbuffalo/info/anthrax.

[According to Parks Canada (https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/pn-np/nt/woodbuffalo/info/anthrax), the area closure sites include Sweetgrass, Trident Creek/Trident Meadows, and Peace Point Junction West. There are 59 bison carcasses near Sweetgrass, Lake One, Trident Creek/Trident Meadows, Peace Point West Junction, and Flat Grass areas of the park. These are all remote locations in Wood Buffalo National Park. These are not adjoining sites but widely separated, which adds to the puzzlement. How does nature get these sites to fire up coincidentally? The weather there has been hot and dry, which will have stressed the innate resistance of the bison, meaning that any infective dose can be minimal. The past 2 summers have been wet, which would have encouraged soil spores' germination and multiplication. And are they all the same genetic strain or just similar but with significant differences? So far Parks Canada has sampled just 3 dead bison and come back with 3 laboratory confirmations. A quick resampling of the sites for bloody soils is not difficult, as they have access to a helicopter and this would enable a genetic reassessment. With thanks to my colleague Brett. - Mod.MHJ
