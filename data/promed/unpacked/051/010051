Disease affects potato cultivation in West Bengal
-------------------------------------------------
Potato cultivators in Hooghly district of West Bengal are facing a
crisis with the outbreak of a mysterious disease [most likely to be
late blight - Mod.DHA]. Farmers in Singur are worrying about their
uncertain future.

The farmers have already lost a major part of their crop due to the
unknown disease. Sukumar Samanta, President of Singur Ratanpur Aalu
Baybsai Samity said about 1.3-1.4 million tons of potato was expected
in comparison to last year's potato cultivation of over 2.1 million tons.

This year compared to the usual potato cultivation in Hooghly
district [West Bengal], 5000 hectares [approx. 12 360 acres] less
have been planted with potato. This year's [2008-2009] winter was not
favourable for the crop. The disease has affected 35 percent of the
crops. Production would only be about 65 percent in comparison to last year.

Potato yield likely to fall in Barisal region
---------------------------------------------
Farmers fear sharp fall in potato production in 6 districts of
Barisal region [division] this season [2008-2009] as their crop
fields have been massively attacked with late blight, a fungal
disease, due to inclement weather. The 'late blight' has caused
extensive damage to potato plants on vast tracts of land in Barisal,
Patuakhali, Pirojpur, Bhola, Barguna, and Jhalakati districts [in
Barisal division], causing worries to the farmers, locals said.

Cold wave accompanied by dense fog is mainly responsible for the
disease attack on the potato fields, according to officials of
Department of Agricultural Extension [DAE]. Farmers are now casting
doubt about whether the production target could be achieved as the
disease has hampered timely growth of potato plants in many areas of
the districts.

Two farmers in Barisal said the disease attacked potato on 10
hectares [approx. 25 acres] land out of 40 hectares [approx. 100
acres] in the area. Another farmer said at least 60 percent of potato
on his 8 acres [approx 3 ha] of land was damaged by the diseases, and
yet another farmer said late blight damaged almost 30 percent of the
plants on his 5 acres [approx. 2 ha] of land.

Molla Safiur Rahman, additional director of DAE in Barisal, said
agriculture extension officials had promptly advised farmers to spray
pesticides when the attack was at primary stage. Farmers said they
followed the advice of DAE but all of their efforts were in vain.
Besides, many farmers could not use fungicides due to high prices.

[Potato late blight (PLB) is caused by the fungus-like organism
_Phytophthora infestans_ and can cause 100 percent crop loss. It is
spread by plant material (including seed tubers), wind, and water.
PLB disease management generally relies on fungicide treatments of
seed tubers and crops, but new and more virulent strains are emerging
frequently. For more information on PLB see links and previous
ProMED-mail posts below.

While PLB often causes problems in the region of India and its
neighbours, the disease has been extraordinarily rampant this
planting season (2008-2009). Weather conditions have been partly
blamed, but it must be considered that lack of efficient
certification of seed potatoes may be playing a role in these recent
outbreaks as well. Emergence of a new strain with increased fungicide
resistances can also not be excluded.
