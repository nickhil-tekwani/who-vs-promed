France: Suspected Imported Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Case Not Confirmed
----------------------------------------------------------------------
French press sources in Alsace have just reported that the 69-year old male
who returned with respiratory difficulties after a 15 day vacation visit to
Viet Nam and Cambodia earlier in the week does not appear to have
contracted avian influenza A (H5N1) virus infection [see: Avian influenza,
human - France (ex Viet Nam): susp. 20041202.3219].

Because of heightened concern over a possible pandemic from this virus, the
patient was isolated in an intensive care unit at the Central University
Hospital in Nancy, pending diagnostic tests. Blood and tissue samples were
sent to the Pasteur Institute in Paris where it was determined that avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus was not present. The cause of his current illness
is still not determined.
