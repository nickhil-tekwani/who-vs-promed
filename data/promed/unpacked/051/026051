Two cases of meningococcal disease have been confirmed in Sydney this week, sparking fears of a full-blown outbreak. The boys, from Manly on the city's Northern Beaches, are high school students who are members of the same sporting club; 2 of their teammates are awaiting test results. The 2 confirmed cases have been responding well to their treatment, The Daily Telegraph reported. One case was confirmed to have the type B strain of the disease while the other has yet to be determined.

Northern Sydney Local Health District warned locals to watch for signs of the disease, which can kill in less than a day or result in the loss of limbs. There are 5 common strains of meningococcal disease in Australia - A, B, C, W, and Y. Immunisations for the types A, C, W, and Y are available under the National Immunisation Program. The vaccination for meningococcal types A, C, W, and Y is available under the National Immunisation Program for children at 12-months-old and students in year 10. The vaccination for the type B strain is not under the National Immunisation Program for Children program.

[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of meningococcal disease, infects only humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_ colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat; up to 5-10% of a population may be asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriers, but the carrier rate may be higher in epidemic situations. Droplets of nasopharyngeal secretions from these carriers are responsible for the spread of the disease. Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or a carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.

Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, based on the antigenic specificity of their capsular polysaccharides, disease due to serogroups A, B, C, Y, and W is most common. Immunity following the use of a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Some vaccines contain capsular polysaccharides (A, C, Y, W), either alone or conjugated to a protein. Conjugate vaccines are preferable, because, unlike the polysaccharide vaccines, conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than the polysaccharide vaccines. Serogroup B vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens because group B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and is a potential auto-antigen.

Following the mass introduction into the population of a meningococcal vaccine specific for one particular serogroup, the incidence of disease due to that serogroup has been found to fall dramatically, such as serogroup C disease in the UK following the introduction of C vaccine and serogroup A in the African Meningitis Belt following A vaccine, only to be replaced by the emergence of disease due to other meningococcal serogroups.

In Australia, following the introduction of the conjugate meningococcal C vaccine in 2003, there has been a significant and sustained reduction in serogroup C meningococcal cases from 34% of cases in 2003 to 5.7% in 2012, accompanied by an increase in serogroup B from 60% in 2003 to 83% in 2012 (http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/cda-cdi3703-pdf-cnt.htm/$FILE/cdi3703e.pdf).

In Australia, as of July 2018, a single funded dose of MenACWY vaccine (Nimenrix) is scheduled at 12 months of age. As of 1 Apr 2019, a single dose of MenACWY vaccine (Nimenrix) is also provided for adolescents through a school-based program (14- to 16-year-olds); those aged 15-19 years who did not receive the vaccine at school can receive it from their GP. MenACWY vaccine is also strongly recommended (but not funded) for infants younger than 12 months of age, adolescents and young adults aged 20-24 years who live in close quarters or who are current smokers, and travelers to areas where meningococcal disease is more common (http://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2019-05/Childhood-schedule-table_May_2019_Final.pdf). However, some Australian states provide free vaccine to additional age groups. Western Australia (WA) funds MenACWY vaccine for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children aged 6 weeks to 4 years (https://healthywa.wa.gov.au/Articles/J_M/Meningococcal-vaccine).

MenB vaccine is recommended for all people 6 months of age and older (but not funded) for infants and young children under 2 years of age, adolescents aged 15-19 years, and adolescents and young adults aged 15-24 years who live in close quarters or who are current smokers (http://ncirs.org.au/sites/default/files/2019-05/Childhood-schedule-table_May_2019_Final.pdf). However, the MenB vaccine is free for all Aboriginal children aged up to 2 years of age (https://www.health.gov.au/health-topics/immunisation/immunisation-throughout-life/immunisation-for-aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-people). Both the MenACWY AND MenB vaccines are also free for people of all ages with certain medical risk conditions (https://ww2.health.wa.gov.au/Media-releases/2020/Meningococcal-disease-in-an-adult-case-9).

Invasive meningococcal disease is more common in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children (https://www.nps.org.au/australian-prescriber/articles/meningococcal-vaccines-in-australia-a-2019-update). In 2019, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples had a 10-fold increased incidence of meningococcal disease than the non-indigenous across some age groups. The most common strains causing infection were types B and W (https://mvec.mcri.edu.au/immunisation-references/aboriginal-and-torres-strait-islander-immunisation-recommendations/).

Manly is a beach-community suburb of northern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia, located 17 km (11 mi) north-east of the Sydney central business district, which is easily accessible by ferry (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manly,_New_South_Wales).
