The city council (of Zoetermeer) is reporting sick rabbits in various
parks. These rabbits (are infected with) myxomatosis, a viral disease
related to smallpox and spread by biting insects like mosquitoes and
fleas. The disease occurs mainly in summer and late summer.

Myxomatosis is characterized by swelling of the eyelids, mouth, and
anus. Due to the membrane around the eyes swelling, the rabbits can no
longer see, and thus they are easy prey for other wildlife such as
birds of prey.

Rabbits are susceptible to this disease and other illnesses such as
pneumonia, which they die of. Only 5-10 percent of infected rabbits
survive in the wild.

Owners of pet rabbits that live on the edge of the recreation (area)
are being advised to vaccinate their rabbits. The municipality removes
the dead rabbits [upon calls].

[Myxomatosis is a major disease of the European rabbit caused by the
Myxoma virus, a member of the Poxviridae family. The diagnosis of
myxomatosis, regardless of its clinical form, depends on the isolation
and identification of the virus or the demonstration of its antigens.
The presence of a humoral immune response facilitates a retrospective
diagnosis of a mild form of the disease and can provide an indication
of the prevalence of infection in a rabbit population. The disease is
characterised by gross myxomatous skin lesions. It is not zoonotic.

Netherlands reported to the OIE the presence of the disease, without
quantitative data, in the years 2005-2007. It may be assumed that the
said situation has not changed since then and that it is similar to
other parts of Europe. - Mod.AS]
