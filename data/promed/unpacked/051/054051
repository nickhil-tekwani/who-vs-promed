The epidemic situation in the Kaliningrad Oblast [region]
---------------------------------------------------------
As has been reported earlier, laboratory tests performed in the
Kaliningrad interregional veterinary laboratory in the framework of
the ASF [African swine fever] monitoring of samples taken from wild
boars shot in hunting entities of the Pravdinsk district of the
Kaliningrad Oblast and from a domestic pig shot during backyard
slaughter in the settlement Kostyukovka of the Pravdinsk district of
the Kaliningrad Oblast gave positive results.

Laboratory tests performed in the All-Russia Research Institute of
Veterinary Virology and Microbiology (SSI ARRIVV&M of the
Rosselkhozacademy) have not confirmed the diagnosis.

[This is indeed relieving information: no ASF confirmed in
Kaliningrad, bordering Poland and Lithuania.

Since the start of the continuing ASF epizootic in Russia, reportedly
on 11 Sep 2009, 118 outbreaks of the disease have been reported by
Russia to the OIE. The 1st ("immediate notification") report and 50
"follow-up" reports, as well as an interactive map showing all
outbreaks, are available at
<http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8462>.

The most recent follow-up report, notifying 2 new outbreaks, was
submitted on 8 Feb 2011. It addresses 2 outbreaks:
1. A commercial pig farm in the Rostov region (476 susceptible
animals, 106 cases, 106 dead, 370 destroyed).
2. One wild boar found infected and destroyed in the Adygeya
Republic.
