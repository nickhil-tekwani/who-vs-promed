Elephant keratitis:
Just a thought! Tuberculosis has been reported in elephants and can cause a
phlyctenular keratitis in humans.

[Phylctenular - associated with the formation of phlyctenules or vesicles,
or of prominences that look like vesicles. A phlyctenule is a small
vesicle, or an ulcerated nodule of the cornea or of the conjunctiva. Some
phlyctenules are associated with allergies (allergic phlyctenulosis) and
some with such diseases as tuberculosis, (tuberculous phlyctenulosis). -

I'd agree with the comment that this is a systemic problem, not
particularly an eye problem. And I would have said this, before I saw that
the animals were abnormal hemotologically. Diffuse bilateral corneal edema
without fluorescein stain makes me think of a uveitis that is affecting
primarily corneal endothelium. Canine hepatitis (blue eye) does this in
dogs.
