Officer bitten by rabid fox
--------------
Waiting to be tracked by other officers, Harvey Barrera sat next to a
tree at the San Angelo State Park Wednesday, when a red fox started
biting his leg.
Barrera attempted to swat the fox away with a stick, but the animal
kept gnawing and finally ripped the San Angelo police officer's pants
and broke the skin. Barrera stabbed the fox twice, forcing it to
hide under a cactus.
The fox was finally fatally shot by another officer, who also was
participating in the tracking school sponsored by the Tom Green
County Sheriff's Office.
The fox was sent to Austin to be tested for rabies, and Barrera found
out Thursday the results came back positive. He immediately began
his vaccines, which are a set of 5 small injections in the arm, and
joked that he hasn't yet had any symptoms connected with the disease.
"I had the desire to raid a chicken coop, but that went away after
receiving the rabies vaccination," Barrera said, laughing.
Unfortunately, the serious disease is not uncommon in San Angelo animals.
"We live out here in good ol' West Texas," said Jan McCleery, a
registered nurse at the San Angelo-Tom Green County Health
Department. "That's always going to be an issue out here. With the
lack of rain and the dryness, the little creatures tend to come in
closer to the city."
McCleery advised staying away from animals that are normally
nocturnal. [Wild animals are often afraid of humans unless they have
been conditioned to being fed by them. This does not sound like such
a case. - Mod.TG]
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the
majority of rabies cases reported occur in wild animals like
raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. Domestic animals account for less
than 10 percent of all cases.
Rabies, a viral disease of the central nervous system, can be
contracted through the bite of a rabid animal or its saliva, said a
brochure issued by McCleery.
She suggested that people not touch any animal when out in the woods.
She also said to use gloves to pick up dead animals or call animal
control.
