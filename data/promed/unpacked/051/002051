The Public Health Institute yesterday [26 Jan 2012] confirmed a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] in the Regional Hospital Guillermo Grant Benavente of Concepcion.

The report is of a young student of the Bio-Bio Chillan University, who resides in the Concepcion capital. The patient was admitted to hospital service with suspicious symptoms (fever, myalgia), because of which tests were carried out. Accpording to the Health SEREMI [regional governmental ministerial unit], the young person is currently in stable condition, progressing favorably in the intensive care unit of the Guillermo Grant Benavente Regional Hospital of Concepcion, information that was confirmed by the Nuble Health SEREMI, Paola Blasco.

The health authorities still are not clear about where the infection was acquired, although it is suspected that the youth might have contracted the disease [infection] in the Pinto community of the Los Lleuques locale.

As for the date of the infection, it is estimated that it was between 24 - 28 Dec [2011], so the case was included in the 2011 statistics. Given this, there were 14 cases that occurred in the region last year [2011]. The prevalence rate is 0.68 cases per 100 000 population, and the fatality rate is 42.8 per cent.

When and if the locality of infection of the university youth is confirmed as Los Lleuques, the number of cases registered in Nuble during 2011 would increase to 4.

A 44-year-old man was taken from the Hornopiren locality to Puerto Montt for admission to the main medical facility of that city. This occurred after he was taken from the CESFAM [Family Health Center] in Hornopiren, after 9 days with a clinical picture of coughing, malaise, diarrhea without vomiting and without abdominal pain: symptoms that correspond to by the presence of [a] hantavirus [infection].

The patient is a fisherman in the area and, according to information from health authority there are no antecedents that he had been traveling in forests or along unimproved trails where long-tailed [pygmy rice] rats are present, his house being located on a fishing creek called El Manzano, some 20 km [12 mi] from Hornopiren, a place where this past Wednesday [18 Jan 2012] medical teams from the area went to initiate epidemiological and environmental investigations.

Once in Puerto Montt, the hantavirus rapid test was done with positive results. However, the physicians are awaiting the confirmation from the Public Health Institute in Santiago.

Meanwhile, the patient remains in stable condition and isolated in the emergency room of the [Puerto Montt] Base Hospital. He is being evaluated for a move to the intensive care unit on those premises.

[Neither of the above reports indicates which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, but most likely Andes virus is involved. The areas where the infection occurred is endemic for this virus, and sporadic cases occur.

An image of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at http://www.bios.niu.edu/frayjorge/rod6.jpg.
