So far this year [2008], dengue has left 27 049 cases in its wake,
1826 of which have been DHF. This total has surpassed by 17 percent
that of the same period in 2007, when 23 062 were reported.

Zulia, with 5761 cases, is the state with the greatest incidence of
dengue in the country, followed by Merida (1895 [cases]), Lara
(1591), and Monagas (1537).

The figures are reflected in the bulletin for epidemiological week 25
[15-21 Jun 2008], which was obtained unofficially, since in 2008 the
Ministry of Health has ceased to make public reports of notifiable diseases.

This report reveals that, on average, Venezuela records some 1082
cases weekly with a monthly number of 4704.

[The bulletin] also reports that, as of 21 Jun 2008, 11 states in the
country had already exceeded 1000 dengue illnesses while in the same
period of 2007 only 7 states had surpassed that figure.

The cumulative incidence rate, which the Ministry of Health has
recorded in bulletin 25 is 96.8 cases per 100 000 population, with
the ratio of classical dengue to DHF at 14 to 1.

It is not known whether up to 21 Jun [2008] there had been DHF deaths
in the country because the data have been unreported in the Weekly
Epidemiological Bulletins since August 2007.

The executive bulletin indicates that during epidemiological week 25
(15-21 Jun 2008) there were 512 dengue cases diagnosed, 6 percent
more than the number observed in the previous week with 481 [cases].

The number of [dengue] illnesses reported by the Ministry of Health
during this epidemiological week might be higher due to the fact that
almost 6 percent of the notifying units (hospitals, clinics,
neighborhood [health] modules) in the country have not transmitted
the [dengue case] information.

Public health experts calculate that for every person who comes to
health service [units] there are another 10 who do not come in for
various reasons. If to date there have been a total of 27 042
recorded cases then without knowing, 270 000 people may have suffered
classical dengue [infections].

[Public reporting of cases from official sources, especially during
an outbreak, is essential for public health authorities and health
providers in the broad geographic area to know what is happening and
be alert to the potential spread to their areas and countries.
ProMED-mail urges Venezuela to resume making their very valuable
epidemiological bulletins generally available.

In Jakarta Timur, 46 of 65 districts, including all the Duren Sawit
Subdistrict districts and Cakung, were designated "red" for cases of
dengue fever.

According to Sudin Kesmas (Health Service) Jakarta East, Duren Sawit
was still in 1st place in the number of the dengue fever sufferers
followed by the Cakung Subdistrict. He provided details indicating
that dengue sufferers in Duren Sawit numbered 1610 cases, whereas in
Cakung there were 1358 cases.

Following were Jatinegara (765 cases), Pulogadung (748 cases),
Kramatjati (651 cases), Matraman (490 cases), Makasar (437 cases),
Ciracas (366 cases), Cipayung (364 cases), and Pasar Rebo 237 cases.
The total of dengue sufferers in Jakarta East at this time reached 7026 cases.

In Jakarta East there were also 18 "yellow" districts. [Presumably
not having as many dengue cases as the "red" districts. - Mod.TY].
Those that are in the yellow list, could, by next week, become red
should efforts for the eradication of the mosquito breeding sites by
residents not progress, he said, on Friday (4 Jul 2008).

Nevertheless, there is still one district that has the "green"
status, that is in Kel. Pondok Ranggon. To maintain that green status
there must be continued vigilance so as not to have dengue cases in
the territory, he explained.

Jakarta East Mayor, Murhdani, asked the related agency that the PSN
social efforts (destroying mosquito breeding sites) also be carried
out as religious duties in houses. He was convinced, with the
approach as a manner [of religious] piety, that it will produce
satisfactory results.
