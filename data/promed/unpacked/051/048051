Rat fever (leptospirosis) has claimed 118 Sri Lankan lives in the
last 8 months with 3960 cases being reported. This is an alarming
increase in patients with the disease in the country. Only 34 deaths
were reported in 2007 and the number of reported cases was 2195,
deputy director general, Public Health Services, Dr PG Maheepala said.

Addressing the press at the Epidemiology Unit, Colombo, yesterday [8
Sep 2008] Dr Maheepala said 12 districts had been affected by the
epidemic while 26 deaths were reported from Peradeniya, and 4 deaths
were reported from Colombo. The number of deaths reported from
Wathupitivala is 13. Statistics have been taken from 16 State
hospitals and according to the statistics the epidemic has affected
Gampaha, Kegalle, Matale, Matara, and several other districts.
Emerging high-risk areas are Anuradhapura and Ratnapura, he said.

According to the acting chief epidemiologist, Dr Paba Palihawadana,
farmers, drain cleaners, persons working in mines, marsh lands,
canals, and persons who swim or play in contaminated water should
contact the PHI (public health inspector) or MOH (Ministry of Health)
and obtain doxycycline tablets. "Two tablets should be taken before
starting work. The tablets give around 90 percent protection for a
week. 2 tablets should be taken again until they finish their work."
She urged the public to drink boiled water and stressed that paddy
fields should be kept clean.

Leptospirosis is an infectious disease caused by pathogenic bacteria
that live in the kidneys of animals such as rats, pigs, cattle,
rodents, canines, and wild mammals. It comes to soil, water, or food
through their urine and enters the human body through cuts, wounds,
and nasal, oral, eye or mucous membranes. The bacteria can live in
the environment for over a month.

[Avoidance of potentially contaminated water is certainly indicated
in the prevention of leptospirosis. In particularly high-risk
situations, the use of 200 mg of doxycycline once weekly is useful in
decreasing clinical disease. In one study involving military trainees
in Panama (1), efficacy in preventing disease was 95 percent. In
another study in civilians during the rainy season, on islands off
the coast of India (2), prophylaxis decreased disease but did not
have an effect on seroconversion.
