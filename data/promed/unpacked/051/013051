Europe
------
- Germany has added France's eastern Moselle region to its list of "variant of concern" areas, triggering tougher entry requirements at the border between the 2 neighbors. Under the new restrictions, almost all travel will be banned. There are only a few exemptions, including lorry drivers and certain key workers. Anyone crossing the border will have to provide a valid negative COVID-19 test. Earlier this month [February 2021], Germany added the Czech Republic and Tyrol in Austria to its list of hotspots where the UK and South African variants -- thought to be more contagious -- are spreading. Entry bans targeting those areas caused long tailbacks on motorways leading to the German border. The travel restrictions for Moselle are due to take effect from Tuesday [2 Mar 2021].

- The majority of people in Germany are still in support of the current lockdown measures, but the share has been slowly dropping, a poll published on Sunday [28 Feb 2021] by the Welt am Sonntag. The share of the population which considered the coronavirus measures appropriate was at 63% in February [2021], down from 69% in November [2020] and 73% in September [2020]. Germany's Robert Koch Institute reported 7890 new cases in the past 24 hours on Sunday [28 Feb 2021]. There were also 157 coronavirus deaths reported -- this brought the total number of deaths in the country since the beginning of the pandemic to over 70 000.

- Britain's government says families with children in school will be provided with free twice-weekly coronavirus home test kits, regardless of whether anyone has symptoms. The tests will be offered as part of plans for schools to reopen, beginning on [Mon 8 Mar 2021].

- Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been vaccinated against coronavirus, he announced on his official Facebook page on Sunday [28 Feb 2021]. He received the shot developed by China's Sinopharm pharmaceutical company.

- Danish police have arrested 8 people at an anti-lockdown demonstration in Copenhagen. The largely peaceful rally late Saturday [27 Feb 2021] was attended by around 1200 people. It was the 1st such protest since the government announced last week that it was extending many anti-coronavirus restrictions. The police said they arrested people for allegedly using fireworks and for rowdy behavior.

Americas
--------
- The US Food and Drug Administration approved the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for emergency use on Saturday evening [27 Feb 2021], making it the 3rd vaccine to be given the green light in the country.

- Thousands of Argentinians gathered in front of government buildings in Buenos Aires on Saturday [27 Feb 2021] evening to protest "vaccine privileges." The revelation that people close to the minister of health had been able to jump the queue sparked outrage and ended with the minister losing his position.

Africa
------
- Nigeria expects to become the 3rd West African country to receive vaccines from the COVAX program. It is expecting 3.92 million doses in the shipment. The country is expecting 16 million overall doses in the next few months from COVAX. The country plans to vaccinate 40% of its some 200 million people by the end of the year [2021], and 30% more in 2022.

- South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said there is an agreement to secure 11 million Johnson & Johnson vaccines through the end of the year. About 1/4 of those vaccines would come in the 2nd quarter of 2021. Ramaphosa added that the cabinet decided to ease restrictions on movement due to a drop in cases, downgrading the national alert level from 3 to 1.

Asia and Oceania
----------------
- Iran's coronavirus fatalities broke the 60 000 mark on Sunday [28 Feb 2021] after a further 93 people died in 24 hours, according to the Health Ministry. The Islamic Republic is battling the Middle East's worst outbreak of the illness.

- Residents in New Zealand's biggest city Auckland woke up on Sunday [28 Feb 2021] to a 2nd lockdown this month [February 2021]. The 7-day lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern after a community coronavirus case was found with no links to a previous cluster. The person had also been infectious for a week but was not in isolation, fueling concerns that there could be additional cases [apparently the case was connected to the case earlier in February 2021, according to the other cases' family https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/coronavirus/124390078/covid19-case-n-went-for-a-walk-with-mother-in-cluster-household-during-alert-level-3.]

- Thailand launched its vaccination program on Sunday [28 Feb 2021], administering doses of the Chinese SinoVac vaccine to frontline health and medical workers as well as cabinet ministers. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, 66, fell outside of the age range of the SinoVac vaccine -- 18-59 -- and so did not receive a dose.

- The Philippines has received its 1st batch of COVID-19 vaccines. The 600 000 doses were donated by China. The country is among the last in Southeast Asia to secure the critical doses despite having the 2nd-highest number of coronavirus infections and deaths in the hard-hit region.

[Other developments in Africa: Ghana became the "1st country to receive COVID-19 vaccines through the World Health Organization's COVAX program on Wednesday [24 Feb 2021], a joint statement issued by UNICEF Ghana and WHO Ghana said.

The vaccines were produced by the Serum Institute of India, in the Indian city of Pune, and are part of the 1st wave of COVID-19 vaccines headed to low and middle-income countries, the joint statement added. "Today marks the historic moment for which we have been planning and working so hard," said UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore. "With the 1st shipment of doses, we can make good on the promise of the COVAX facility to ensure people from less wealthy countries are not left behind in the race for life-saving vaccines."
(Excerpted from https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/24/africa/ghana-covax-vaccine-intl/index.html)]

"Ivory Coast received a shipment of COVID-19 doses from the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility on Friday [26 Feb 2021], becoming the 2nd country to benefit from a programme meant to ensure fairer distribution amid a global scramble. A plane carrying 504 000 doses touched down in the commercial capital Abidjan, paving the way for the West African nation to launch a vaccination campaign next week.

"By the end of this year [2021], COVAX plans to deliver nearly 2 billion doses to over 90 low- and middle-income countries, hoping to level a playing field that has seen wealthier nations vaccinate millions while comparatively few have received shots in poorer parts of the world."

[2] WHO: intellectual property rules
Date: Fri 26 Feb 2021
Source: Al Jazeera, Reuters report [edited]

COVAX: WHO
----------
WHO chief urges countries to waive intellectual property rules, to allow others to make vaccines more quickly. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says 'we can't beat COVID without vaccine equity'26 Feb 2021 Countries seeking their own COVID-19 vaccine doses are making deals with drug companies that threaten the supply for the global COVAX programme for poor and middle-income countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Fri [26 Feb 2021].

"Now, some countries are still pursuing deals that will compromise the COVAX supply. Without a doubt," WHO senior adviser Bruce Aylward told a briefing.

The WHO has long called upon rich countries to ensure that vaccines are shared equitably. The global organisation is one of the leaders of COVAX, a programme that aims to supply 1.3 billion vaccine doses to poor and middle-income countries this year. But so far, COVAX has had a slow roll-out. "We can't beat COVID without vaccine equity. Our world will not recover fast enough without vaccine equity, this is clear," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

"We have made great progress. But that progress is fragile. We need to accelerate the supply and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and we cannot do that if some countries continue to approach manufacturers who are producing vaccines that COVAX is counting on."

"These actions undermine COVAX and deprive health workers and vulnerable people around the world of life-saving vaccines."

The Ivory Coast received its 1st batch of coronavirus vaccines under the COVAX scheme on Friday [26 Feb 2021]

Intellectual property plea Tedros also called for countries to waive intellectual property rules, to allow other countries to make vaccines more quickly. "If not now, when?" he asked.

The idea of temporarily waiving intellectual property rights for tools to fight COVID-19 is set to come up again next week at a meeting of World Trade Organization (WTO) member states. In the past, it has run into opposition from rich countries with big pharmaceutical industries.

Incoming WTO head Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of Nigeria has said her top priority would be to ensure the trade body does more to address the COVID-19 pandemic, calling disparities in vaccine rates between rich and poor "unconscionable".

The 164-member WTO body usually has to agree by consensus unless members agree to proceed to a rare vote.

Separately, the WHO said Nigeria is expecting its 1st 4 million doses of coronavirus vaccines next week via COVAX. Walter Kazadi Mulombo, head of WHO's mission in Nigeria, told a briefing by video link that Nigeria was expecting 14 million doses in total.

Chikwe Ihekweazu, Director General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), said the situation in Nigeria was so far much better than had been widely predicted early in the pandemic.

Nigeria, Africa's most populous country with some 200 million people, has reported fewer than 1900 COVID-19 deaths so far.

"The whole world expected the continent of Africa, and Nigeria with our social and economic realities, to basically fall apart," Ihekweazu told the briefing.

He also referred to the findings of seroprevalence studies, published on Monday [22 Feb 2021], which suggested that 23 percent of Lagos state inhabitants -- around 4 million people -- may have had COVID-19 in October [2020].

He said studies in 4 Nigerian states had shown that serious illness appeared to be rarer than feared, possibly in part because of the young average age of the population.

"Getting the vaccine into Nigeria will serve the continent well, will serve the world well," he said.

Nigeria plans to inoculate 40 percent of the population this year [2021] and 30 percent more in 2022.

Ihekweazu said authorities recognised the need for equity in access to vaccines and was committed to pursuing multilateral deals.

"We will not look for bilateral deals," Ihekweazu said.

"We will work in a multilateral way with WHO, with COVAX with the African Union (AU) to make sure that as we get vaccines into Nigeria, the same happens ... across the continent," he said.

[It is important to control COVID-19 and fair to the people that low- and middle-income countries have equal access to the vaccine. The COVAX programme aims to supply 1.3 billion vaccine doses to poor and middle-income countries this year. (2021). Because of competition for vaccines, this program presents a challenge. It is up to the wealthier countries to ensure this takes place, but it is unlikely countries will agree to waive intellectual property rules, to allow others to make vaccines more quickly.

According to the WHO, COVAX offers:
- "Doses for at least 20% of countries' populations
- Diverse and actively managed portfolio of vaccines
- Vaccines delivered as soon as they are available
- End the acute phase of the pandemic
- Rebuild economies"

[3] Research: holistic model of SARS-CoV-2; spike proteins move in tandem
Date: Sun 28 Feb 2021
Source: HPC Wire [abridged, edited]
https://www.hpcwire.com/2021/02/28/supercomputers-enable-first-holistic-model-of-sars-cov-2-showing-spike-proteins-move-in-tandem/


Most models of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, hone in on key features of the virus: for instance, the spike protein. Some of this is attributable to the relative importance of those features, but most is attributable to computational necessity -- simulating even a single protein in such excruciating resolution is extraordinarily computation-intensive. Now, researchers from the University of Chicago and the University of California, San Diego have developed the 1st complete model of the coronavirus, finding, among other things, that its spike proteins move cooperatively.

"We wanted to understand how SARS-CoV-2 works holistically as a whole particle," said Gregory Voth, a professor of chemistry at the University of Chicago and corresponding author of the study, in an interview with Jorge Salazar of the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). "We developed a bottom-up coarse-grained model where we took information from atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations and from experiments."

Voth and his colleagues have been using the coarse-grained modeling method, which resolves groups of atoms rather than each individual atom, to study viruses like HIV and the flu for decades. "The benefit of the coarse-grained model is that it can be hundreds to thousands of times more computationally efficient than the all-atom model," he said. "What you're left with are the much slower, collective motions. The effects of the higher frequency, all-atom motions are folded into those interactions if you do it well. That's the idea of systematic coarse-graining."

Using the coarse-graining method, the team simplified and combined atomistic models of SARS-CoV-2's spike, membrane, nucleocapsid, and envelope proteins. Some of these all-atom models were generated by the Amaro Lab (led by Gordon Bell Special Prize winner Rommie Amaro) using the 23.5 Linpack petaflops Frontera supercomputer at TACC, and the remaining models were generated on the Anton 2 system at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC).

"Frontera and Anton 2 provided the key molecular level input data into this model," Voth said. "Frontera has been especially useful in providing the molecular dynamics data at the atomistic level for feeding into this model. It's very valuable."

The supercomputer-powered coarse-grained model showed some interesting behavior: the virus' spike proteins, which litter its surface and allow it to infect human cells, move cooperatively.

"They don't move independently like a bunch of random, uncorrelated motions. They work together," Voth said. "The paper we published shows the beginnings of how the modes of motion in the spike proteins are correlated.

The ultimate goal of the model would be, as a 1st step, to study the initial virion attractions and interactions with ACE2 receptors on cells and to understand the origins of that attraction and how those proteins work together to go on to the virus fusion process."

"Abstract
---------
"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Computer simulations of complete viral particles can provide theoretical insights into large-scale viral processes including assembly, budding, egress, entry, and fusion. Detailed atomistic simulations are constrained to shorter timescales and require billion-atom simulations for these processes. Here, we report the current status and ongoing development of a largely "bottom-up" coarse-grained (CG) model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion. Data from a combination of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), x-ray crystallography, and computational predictions were used to build molecular models of structural SARS-CoV-2 proteins, which were then assembled into a complete virion model. We describe how CG molecular interactions can be derived from all-atom simulations, how viral behavior difficult to capture in atomistic simulations can be incorporated into the CG models, and how the CG models can be iteratively improved as new data become publicly available. Our initial CG model and the detailed methods presented are intended to serve as a resource for researchers working on COVID-19 who are interested in performing multiscale simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 virion.

"Significance
-------------
"This study reports the construction of a molecular model for the SARS-CoV-2 virion and details our multiscale approach toward model refinement. The resulting model and methods can be applied to and enable the simulation of SARS-CoV-2 virions.

"A holistic model of the SARS-CoV-2 virion can provide insight into the mechanisms of large-scale viral processes and the collective behavior of macromolecules involved in viral replication and infectivity."

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (52 520), Brazil (34 027), and France (19 952) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 6599 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (late 27 Feb 2021 to late 28 Feb 2021). Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (8 countries) include the USA, Brazil, France, Italy (17 440), India (15 801), Russia (11 359), Poland (10 101), and Mexico (10 056). A total of 47 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 47 countries are from the European region, 11 are from the Americas region, 7 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 2 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 3 from the African region. Countries not reporting cases in the past 24 hours include Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Lithuania among others -- this combined with marked reductions in daily counts is indicative of the weekend reporting artifact.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 6.6%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 1.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 2.8% decrease in daily reported cases and a 4.9% increase in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported cases totaled almost 380 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 114.36 million cumulative reported cases and over 2.53 million reported deaths. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts. Importantly, the declining 7-day averages of cases and deaths continue to shift so the 7-day average of daily newly confirmed cases is showing increases and deaths are decreasing less, suggesting the 3rd wave is gaining strength again, unconfirmed but possibly due to the impact of the variants in circulation. - Mod.MPP]
