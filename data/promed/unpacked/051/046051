The person responsible for the Institutional Development Office of the Carlos Monge Medrano (ODI) Hospital, Percy Casaperalta Calcina, confirmed the death of a man from yellow fever.

This event was registered in Sandia province between Phara and Limbani. The victim was a 27-year-old man who worked in the mines in this jurisdiction, where he was bitten by a mosquito that transmitted the fatal virus. The official implored the people visiting the forest to get the vaccine 10 days before traveling there to avoid diseases contracted in this area.

[This is a case of sylvan (jungle) yellow fever.

The Sandia province is located in the Puno region in the Peruvian Amazon basin, where yellow fever (YF) virus is endemic. All people living in this region are at risk of yellow fever virus infection transmitted from non-human primates to humans by forest mosquitoes and thus should be vaccinated. Since there are _Aedes aegypti_ that are efficient YF virus vectors present in the general lowlands of the eastern Peru area abundant enough to transmit dengue viruses, there is risk of spill-over of the sylvan transmission cycle into the urban one. That makes YF vaccination of people living in these areas an important preventive measure.
