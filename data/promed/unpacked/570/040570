CRANIOSYNOSTOSIS: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
=========================================
Date: Tue, 15 Apr 1997 12:28:20 +0200
From: Y. Vatharajh <9702695@getafix.utr.ac.za>
Can you provide information on craniosynostosis? We are interested in
primary causes, i.e., the aetiology.

[Some years ago we had what was described as a "cluster" of cases of
craniosynostosis here in Colorado. The incidence was, of course, low but was
higher than expected. As I recall, the cases clustered around a small town
that had been a mining center for many years. Some suggestion of etiology
was made with respect to the groundwater and its higher than acceptable
levels of heavy metal contaminants. I never heard anything after that flurry
of newspaper reports. I have no idea whether my memory holds. Therefore, I
contacted Roderic Smith, a neurosurgeon at the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center, Denver <Roderic.Smith@UCHSC.edu>. His reply:]
"Little is clear about the mechanism or etiology of craniosynostosis except
that it is a process that begins in utero. There is a clear association with
perhaps a hundred genetic syndromes many of which have chromosomal
pathologies. There are also families with either dominant or recessive
transmission. Intracranial malformation can also be associated and secondary
craniosynostosis can occur with catastrophic failures of brain growth. All
summed this may account for 10-15% of what is seen clinically.
Epidemics have been reported but none clearly verified, including one from
the 80's in Colorado. Some have suggested this epidemic was the result of
excessive surgical enthusiasm. This epidemic has now passed into the realm
of the other [referring to baseball] American pastime, tort law.
In utero infection remains as believable a theory as any. Good epidemiology
is still needed.

[Well, I almost had it right. Do any of the readers of ProMED-mail have
information that would suggest an infectious etiology for craniosynostosis?
