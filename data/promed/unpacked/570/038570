2000/004 New data on quarantine pests or pests of the Alert List
----------------------------------------------------------------
By browsing through the literature, the EPPO Secretariat has extracted the
following new data concerning quarantine pests.
New geographical records:
Tomato spotted wilt tospovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest) occurs in Iran. It
causes a disease of tomato in Varamin and Shahriar, near Tehran. Review of
Plant Pathology, 78(12), p 1167 (8799).
Detailed records:
_Claviceps africana_ (EPPO Alert List) occurs in Oklahoma (US) on sorghum
(Claflin & Ramundo, 1999).
Surveys were conducted in Martinique in 1997/1998 on citrus tristeza
closterovirus (EPPO A2 quarantine pest). It was estimated that the average
disease incidence is 21 %. Commercial orchards were less infected than
citrus trees in private gardens. 20-30 year-old trees and limes showed the
highest infection rate (approximately 34 %). Trees grafted on _Citrus
volkameriana_ showed no symptoms of the virus. Review of Plant Pathology,
78(12), p 1184 (8920).
In Argentina, maize Mal de Rio cuarto fijivirus (EPPO Alert List) was
detected in provinces of Tucuman, Cordoba, Santa Fe, Entre Rios, Buenos
Aires, la Pampa, San Luis and Rio Negro. Review of Plant Pathology, 78(12),
p 1140 (8606).
