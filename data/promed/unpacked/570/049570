[This outbreak is a puzzler. Firstly if the cow did not die, the usual 1st sign of bovine anthrax, why was she euthanised? The only explanation that comes to mind was that the owner was a Muslim and faced with a moribund animal, he slaughtered it. If so, how did he authorities get to hear of it? I suspect that there is more to this story than was reported to Paris, starting maybe with a prior neighbour's animal being affected.

Secondly, this official report claims that this was the "First occurrence of a listed disease." But there was a 4 May 2012 report [20120507.1125491] of a butcher with a culture positive cutaneous lesion from butchering a sick pig. Sensu strictu the veterinary laboratory might not have had the opportunity to check any animal samples but "experts from the public health centers and Veterinary Service are investigating to determine the source of transmission."

I suspect that in the coming weeks we will see more reports of outbreaks of this disease in and around that region of the Ukraine.
