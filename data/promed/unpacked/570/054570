China has closed live poultry trade markets and put government departments on alert, after the H7N9 bird flu virus struck over winter, killing at least 61 people this year.

The country's central and coastal provinces were the worst hit by the virus, which has attracted increased attention after a recent scientific study warned that it could become a pandemic and spread across countries.

This could happen if China fails to close loopholes in its live poultry trade, researchers from Hong Kong and China wrote in the British-based science journal Nature. [see item 2 further].

The researchers said the eastern coastal province of Zhejiang had become a springboard and spread the virus southwards and eastwards, Agence France-Presse reported on Wednesday.

No one knows the pandemic potential of the H7N9 avian influenza that has infected more than 560 people in China and killed 204 since it was 1st detected in March 2013. But the largest-ever genomic survey of the virus in poultry now provides a more detailed picture of its evolution and spread.

Such information can help to target control efforts, and to monitor the evolution of the virus. But an analysis of sequences submitted to the GenBank repository in the past 15 years suggests that genetic surveillance of avian flu viruses in birds is patchy and less than prompt. For now, H7N9 flu does not spread easily among people. But as with many bird-flu viruses, a concern is that it could evolve to do so.

In a paper published on Nature's website this week [T. T.-Y. Lam et al. http://dx.doi. org/10.1038/nature14348; 2015], an international team of researchers describes how it tracked the virus from October 2013 to July 2014 by taking swabs from poultry at live-bird markets in 15 cities over 5 provinces in eastern China. The group detected the virus in markets in 7 cities and in 3 percent of samples on average.

The team then sequenced the genomes of 438 viral isolates and found that as the virus spread south, it evolved into 3 main branches, with multiple sub-branches. Such diversification is expected, but tracking it can help to identify the main trade routes and markets that fuel a virus's spread.

"The extent of viral transmission among chickens was largely unclear until our paper showed that the virus had diverged into regional lineages," says Yi Guan, a co-author of the paper and a virologist at the State Key Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases in Shenzhen, China. "Eastern China remains as a reservoir and 'distribution centre' for this virus," he says.

Despite such insights, relatively few sequences of H7N9 have been collected. Sequences from only 8 H7N9 viral isolates collected from birds in 2014 have been deposited in GenBank. That is not enough for geographical mapping of the virus over time, says Marius Gilbert, an avian-flu epidemiologist and ecologist at the French-speaking Free University of Brussels.

Nor is the latest paper up to date. A new winter wave of H7N9 is under way, and probably has different patterns of spread.

In 2012, Nature's news team reported that genetic surveillance of animal-flu viruses is patchy globally: most genomes are sequenced months or years after collection (see Nature 483, 520-522; 2012). Current GenBank data suggest that this is still true. Far more flu sequences are being deposited in GenBank, but many are from samples collected some time ago.

Guan agrees that timely monitoring is important. But surveillance and viral sequencing are costly and time-consuming, and for H7N9 require access to a biosafety-level-3 lab. Given the complications, Guan thinks that the number of recent H7N9 sequences is not grossly low.

Adding to the time lag, public authorities and researchers who sequence flu strains sometimes make the data public only when, or if, they publish -- so sequences can languish. The authors of the latest study have sent sequences to GenBank and had already shared the data with the World Health Organization and other bodies.

Guan and his co-authors warn that H7N9 "should be considered as a major candidate to emerge as a pandemic strain." But predicting pandemic potential is an embryonic science.

In 2014 a prominent international group of researchers argued that there is little evidence that flu viruses that cause sporadic human infections are a greater pandemic threat than viruses that have not yet infected humans (C. A. Russell et al. eLife 3, e03883; 2014). But Guan says that given the vast number of flu viruses, it is necessary to prioritize targets for control and vaccine development -- and that H7N9 should be high on that list.

[The zoonotic H7N9 virus strain responsible for human infections in China has been reported from Eastern China since March 2013, circulating mostly on live poultry markets. This virus strain is of low pathogenicity in poultry (LPAI H7N9), which means the disease symptoms in birds are slight or absent, i.e., subclinical. The birds are, in fact, the reservoir of the virus without becoming sick, their being infected discovered only by tests applied to apparently healthy animals, or -- as seen multiple times -- following human infection, humans playing the unfortunate role of virus sentinels.

Subscribers are encouraged to visit the above News-Comment item by Declan Butler, Nature's Senior Reporter (Paris), which includes graphics. One of them presents the seasonal pattern of H7N9, with the following figures on human disease:
During the spring of 2013, 135 cases, 43 deaths (32 percent fatality rate);
During the 2013/2014 winter season 319 cases, 134 deaths (42 percent case fatality rate); during the current season (starting November 2014, as of the end of February 2015), 114 cases, 27 deaths (24 percent case fatality rate).

China's last report to the OIE on H7N9 detected in (tested) poultry dates back to 9 Jul 2014 (see, with map of all "outbreaks", most of them discovered on live animal markets, not on farms, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=13225).

OIE's Q&A on LPAI H7N9 is available at http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/questions-and-answers-on-influenza-ah7n9/. China's Ministry of Agriculture LPAI H7N9 information is available in Chinese at http://www.moa.gov.cn/sjzz/syj/dwyqdt/. - Mod.AS
