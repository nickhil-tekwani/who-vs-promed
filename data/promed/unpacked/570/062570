"Except for the H5 confirmation, the N subtype has not yet been determined.

"The National Task Force for Outbreaks sitting today [17 Jan 2017] in Kampala and chaired by the acting director general of health services has activated the Public Health Emergency Operations Center (PHEOC). It has been agreed to maintain [a designation of the virus] as HPAI at this moment, [although] the N classification has not been determined.

"So far, no human transmission has been reported up to today [17 Jan 2017]. Epidemiological teams have been sent to the 3 localities with reported deaths of birds. Today [17 Jan 2017] has been their 1st day in the field. District emergency response [activities have] been activated in the 3 districts."
