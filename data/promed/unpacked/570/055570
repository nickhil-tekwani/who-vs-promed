A father and his daughter have been confirmed to have spotted fever after traveling to South Africa.

The Centre for Health Protection indicated that the patients' family of 5 traveled to South Africa in December 2011. While there, the father and a daughter were bitten by ticks. On the 4th day upon returning to Hong Kong, the father complained of headache and had an eschar. The daughter was also found to have eschar[s?] and lymphadenopathy. They were seen by a private physician. Both are in stable condition after receiving treatment; no hospitalization is needed. Laboratory tests confirmed both to have been infected by spotted fever. The mother and another daughter also had similar but less severe symptoms. They have recovered after receiving treatment.

[Rickettsioses are causes of arthropod-borne human diseases, which can be roughly divided into typhus, scrub typhus and the spotted fever groups. In retrospect, it is surprising that, given the years that ProMED has been functioning, this is the 1st posting of a spotted fever group infection originating in Africa. This is the case despite Freedman, et al (1) reporting the spotted fever rickettsial diseases were the 2nd most common cause of fever in travelers returning from the developing world, after malaria but before dengue and typhoid fever.

In Africa, Mediterranean spotted fever had long been thought to be the predominant rickettsial disease caused by _R. conorii_. With the identification of _R. africae_ from patients with African tick bite fever in 1992 (2), it has been recognized that this disease is clearly the most prevalent cause of rickettsial infection in sub-Saharan Africa, and this disease is actually commonly reported in travelers returning from South Africa (3), particularly in those traveling to Kruger National Park. The literature contains a significant number of case reports documenting the acquisition of this infection in travelers and is represented by references 4-6. Reference 6 underscores one of the relevant physical findings of _R. africae_ infection, the presence of multiple, rather than one, eschars (lesions referred to a tache noir).

The CDC publication found at http://www.cdc.gov/otherspottedfever/ is a valuable reference listing the large number of spotted fever rickettsiae described throughout the world. The tables also include _R. aeschlimannii_ as a cause of spotted fever in southern Africa.

It is most likely that these cases described are due to _R. africae_ and are cases of African tick bite fever.
