A survey was conducted from 2001 to 2004 in the major cucurbit-growing
areas in Iran to reassess the relative incidence of cucurbit viruses.
Severe yellowing symptoms were observed frequently on older leaves of
cucurbit plants in various regions in outdoor crops, suggesting the
presence of Cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (CABYV, genus Polerovirus,
family Luteoviridae) (1,2). Leaf samples (n = 1019) were collected from
plants of melon (_Cucumis melo_ L.), cucumber (_C. sativus_ L.), squash
(_Cucurbita_ sp.), and watermelon (_Citrullus lanatus_ L.) showing various
virus-like symptoms (mosaic, leaf deformation, yellowing). All samples,
collected from 15 provinces, were screened for the presence of CABYV by
double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DAS-ELISA) with
IgGs and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated IgGs against a CABYV reference
isolate (1). Of the 1019 samples tested, 471 were positive for CABYV using
DAS-ELISA. Some of the positive samples had typical severe yellowing
symptoms while symptoms in other samples were masked by mosaic or leaf
deformations caused by other viruses frequently found in mixed infections
(data not shown). During the entire survey, CABYV was detected by DAS-ELISA
in 201 of 503 melon samples, 72 of 129 cucumber samples, 158 of 249 squash
samples, and 40 of 138 watermelon samples. These results indicate that
CABYV is widely distributed on 4 cucurbit species in the major growing
areas of Iran. In order to confirm CABYV identification, total RNA extracts
(TRI-Reagent, Sigma Chemical, St Louis, MO) were obtained from 25 samples
that were positive using DAS-ELISA originating from Khorasan (n = 4),
Esfahan (n = 6), Teheran (n = 3), Hormozgan (n = 4), Azerbaiejan-E-Sharqi
(n = 4), and Kerman (n = 4). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reactions (RT-PCR) were carried out using forward
(5(prime)-CGCGTGGTTGTGGTCAACCC-3(prime)) and reverse
(5(prime)-CCYGCAACCGAGGAAGATCC-3(prime)) primers designed in conserved
regions of the coat protein gene according to the sequence of a CABYV
reference isolate (3) and 3 other unpublished CABYV sequences. RT-PCR
experiments yielded an expected 479-bp product similar to the fragment
amplified with extracts from the reference isolate. No amplification of the
product occurred from healthy plant extracts. To our knowledge, this is the
1st report of the occurrence of CABYV in Iran on various cucurbit species.
The high frequency (46.2 percent) with which CABYV was detected in the
samples assayed indicates that this virus is one of the most common virus
infecting cucurbits in Iran.

[The cucurbit crop plants mentioned in this report are melon (_Cucumis
melo_), cucumber (_C. sativus_), squash (_Cucurbita pepo_), and watermelon
(_Citrullus lanatus_). They develop yellows symptoms when infected by
cucurbit aphid-borne yellows virus (family: _Luteoviridae_, genus:
_Polerovirus_, CAYBV).
CABYV was widely distributed with high frequency (nearly 50 percent of
samples tested) in these 4 cucurbit species in the major growing areas of
Iran. This conclusion is based on an extensive survey by ELISA throughout
Iran conducted during 2001 to 2004.
CABYV was first reported in France in 1992. So far, it has been recorded in
other European countries (including Greece, Spain and Cyprus) and African
countries (including Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, and Zambia) and in the USA
(California). Typical symptoms of CABYV on cucurbits include yellowing and
thickening of old leaves. The major veins of these leaves remain green.
These symptoms can be masked by mixed infection with other cucurbit
viruses, and this was noted in the current study. Yield reduction in
infected cucumber crops can reach about 50 percent. Major vegetable species
susceptible to CABYV include watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber, zucchini
squash and lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_). CABYV can be transmitted
persistently by the aphid _Aphis gossypii_ with great efficiency and also
by the aphid _Myzus persicae_. CABYV is not transmitted mechanically. The
source of the virus is unknown, possibly wild cucurbits. Resistant curcubit
cultivars are not available, but sources of resistance to CABYV have been
identified in melon accessions.
