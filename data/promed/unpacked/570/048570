A farm near the Turkish capital of Ankara has been placed under quarantine following an outbreak of anthrax, Turkish news website Haberturk said on [Mon 27 Aug 2018]. The alarm was raised after 50 cattle at a farm in Ankara's Gölbaşı district showed symptoms consistent with anthrax infection. The animals were amongst a group of 4000 imported from Brazil in the run up to last week's Eid al-Adha, the Muslim Feast of the Sacrifice. Following an examination of the farm and affected cattle by Gölbaşı's Agriculture and Forestry Directorate, the farm was placed under quarantine.

A statement issued by Turkey's Meat and Dairy Directorate confirmed that test results had returned positive for anthrax and reassured the public that the outbreak had been contained.

"All necessary precautions have been taken to prevent the disease from spreading to other animals outside the farm," the statement said, adding that there was "no worrying situation."

[For a map of Turkey, see: http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/middle_east_and_asia/turkey_physio-2006.jpg; Ankara is central and inland. Gölbaşı is a town and district of the Ankara Province in the Central Anatolia region of Turkey, 20 km (12 mi) south of the city of Ankara: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6lba%C5%9F%C4%B1,_Ankara; "The district includes the Mogan and Eymir lakes. Although the lakes are polluted and infested with mosquitoes, the picnic areas and lakeside restaurants of Gölbaşı serve as a popular retreat from the city for the people of Ankara. A number of government departments have accommodations here, and the town is slowly but surely joining up with the city as the green space between the both disappears. Türk Telekom has their satellite ground control in the area." And thus a ready market for beef while celebrating Eid al-Adha.

Anthrax is common in Turkey and most years see outbreaks in Ankara Province in both cattle and sheep. These cattle would possibly have come by sea from Brazil, not a short voyage, and therefore stressed on arrival and distribution to the various farms. How they acquired this infection and how many out of the 50 is not stated, nor whether they were at pasture or in large corrals. Not cheap animals so any deaths would have been immediately noted and checked. Anthrax is uncommon in Brazil so they didn't bring the infection with them. - Mod.MHJ
