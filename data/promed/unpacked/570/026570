[1] Saliva vs nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of SARS-CoV-2

Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are essential for controlling the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. Although the current standard involves testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to detect SARS-CoV-2, saliva specimens may be an alternative diagnostic sample. Rigorous evaluation is needed to determine how saliva specimens compare with nasopharyngeal swab specimens with respect to sensitivity in detection of SARS-CoV-2 during the course of infection.

A total of 70 inpatients with Covid-19 provided written informed consent to participate in our study. After Covid-19 was confirmed with a positive nasopharyngeal swab specimen at hospital admission, we obtained additional samples from the patients during hospitalization. We tested saliva specimens collected by the patients themselves and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the patients at the same time point by health care workers.

Using primer sequences from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we detected more SARS-CoV-2 RNA copies in the saliva specimens (mean log copies per milliliter, 5.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.09 to 6.07) than in the nasopharyngeal swab specimens (mean log copies per milliliter, 4.93; 95% CI, 4.53 to 5.33) (Figure 1A, and Fig. S1 in Supplementary Appendix 1). In addition, a higher percentage of saliva samples than nasopharyngeal swab samples were positive up to 10 days after the Covid-19 diagnosis (Figure 1B). At 1 to 5 days after diagnosis, 81% (95% confidence interval [CI] 71 to 96) of the saliva samples were positive, as compared with 71% (CI 67 to 94) of the nasopharyngeal swab specimens. These findings suggest that saliva specimens and nasopharyngeal swab specimens have at least similar sensitivity in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 during the course of hospitalization.

Because the results of testing of nasopharyngeal swab specimens to detect SARS-CoV-2 may vary with repeated sampling in individual patients, we evaluated viral detection in matched samples over time. The level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA decreased after symptom onset in both saliva specimens (estimated slope, 0.11; 95% credible interval, 0.15 to 0.06) (Figure 1C) and nasopharyngeal swab specimens (estimated slope, 0.09; 95% credible interval, 0.13 to 0.05) (Figure 1D). In 3 instances, a negative nasopharyngeal swab specimen was followed by a positive swab at the next collection of a specimen (Figure 1D); this phenomenon occurred only once with the saliva specimens (Figure 1C). During the clinical course, we observed less variation in levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the saliva specimens (standard deviation, 0.98 virus RNA copies per milliliter; 95% credible interval, 0.08 to 1.98) than in the nasopharyngeal swab specimens (standard deviation, 2.01 virus RNA copies per milliliter; 95% credible interval, 1.29 to 2.70) (see Supplementary Appendix 1).

Recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the saliva of asymptomatic persons and outpatients. We therefore screened 495 asymptomatic health care workers who provided written informed consent to participate in our prospective study, and we used RT-qPCR to test both saliva and nasopharyngeal samples obtained from these persons. We detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva specimens obtained from 13 persons who did not report any symptoms at or before the time of sample collection. Of these 13 health care workers, 9 had collected matched nasopharyngeal swab specimens by themselves on the same day, and 7 of these specimens tested negative (Fig. S2). The diagnosis in the 13 health care workers with positive saliva specimens was later confirmed in diagnostic testing of additional nasopharyngeal samples by a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988)-certified laboratory.

Variation in nasopharyngeal sampling may be an explanation for false negative results, so monitoring an internal control for proper sample collection may provide an alternative evaluation technique. In specimens collected from inpatients by health care workers, we found greater variation in human RNase P cycle threshold (Ct) values in nasopharyngeal swab specimens (standard deviation, 2.89 Ct; CI 26.53 to 27.69) than in saliva specimens (standard deviation, 2.49 Ct; CI 23.35 to 24.35). When health care workers collected their own specimens, we also found greater variation in RNase P Ct values in nasopharyngeal swab specimens (standard deviation, 2.26 Ct; CI 28.39 to 28.56) than in saliva specimens (standard deviation , 1.65 Ct; CI 24.14 to 24.26) (Fig. S3).

Collection of saliva samples by patients themselves negates the need for direct interaction between health care workers and patients. This interaction is a source of major testing bottlenecks and presents a risk of nosocomial infection. Collection of saliva samples by patients themselves also alleviates demands for supplies of swabs and personal protective equipment. Given the growing need for testing, our findings provide support for the potential of saliva specimens in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

[Eloise Williams and colleagues have reported earlier on the feasibility, acceptability, and scalability of prospectively collecting saliva from ambulatory patients in a busy screening clinic and demonstrate the value of saliva as a noninvasive specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7383524/].

An earlier study by Kai Wang-To and colleagues compared the shedding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in February 2020 and noted that "SARS-CoV has been shown to infect epithelial cells in salivary gland ducts in rhesus macaques. The presence of 2019-nCoV in patients' saliva suggests the possibility of salivary gland infection. However, it should be noted that saliva specimens not only contain saliva secreted from major or minor salivary glands but also contain secretions coming down from the nasopharynx or coming up from the lung via the action of cilia lining the airway. Further studies are required to delineate the sources of 2019-nCoV in saliva" [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7108139/].

Although the sensitivity of saliva as a diagnostic specimen is less than that of nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva testing may be a suitable alternative 1st-line screening test in several environments, including low-resource settings, with nasopharyngeal swabbing reserved for patients with an ongoing high clinical index of suspicion. Furthermore, the variability in the operator techniques may impact the test results. Use of saliva samples from testing would definitely considerably reduce the exposure risk for health care workers, as self-sampling is quite easy. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Ocular manifestations in children with SARS-CoV2 infection
Date: Wed 26 Aug 2020

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2769877


Abstract
---
Importance
Ocular manifestations and outcomes in children with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), relevant affecting factors, and differences in ocular disease between children and adults have yet to be fully understood.

Objective
To investigate ocular manifestations and clinical characteristics of children with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

Design, setting, and participants
This cross-sectional study was conducted at Wuhan Children's Hospital in Wuhan, China. Children with COVID-19 confirmed by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease 2 nucleic acid tests of upper respiratory tract specimens between 26 Jan and 18 Mar 2020, were included.

Results
A total of 216 pediatric patients were included, among whom 134 (62%) were boys, with a median (interquartile range) age of 7.25 (2.6-11.6) years. Based on the exposure history, 193 children (89.4%) had a confirmed (173 [80.1%]) or suspected (20 [9.3%]) family member with COVID-19 infection. The most common symptoms among symptomatic children were fever (81 [37.5%]) and cough (79 [36.6%]). Of 216 children, 93 (43.1%) had no systemic or respiratory symptoms. All children with mild (101 [46.8%]) or moderate (115 [53.2%]) symptoms recovered without reported death. 49 children (22.7%) showed various ocular manifestations, of which 9 had ocular complaints being the initial manifestations of COVID-19. The common ocular manifestations were conjunctival discharge (27 [55.1%]), eye rubbing (19 [38.8%]), and conjunctival congestion (5 [10.2%]). Children with systemic symptoms (29.3% vs 14.0%; difference, 15.3%; 95% CI, 9.8%-20.7%; P = .008) or with cough (31.6% vs 17.5%; difference, 14.1%; 95% CI, 8.0%-20.3%; P = 0.02) were more likely to develop ocular symptoms. Ocular symptoms were typically mild, and children recovered or improved.

Conclusions and relevance
In this cross-sectional study, children hospitalized with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, presented with a series of onset symptoms including fever, cough, and ocular manifestations, such as conjunctival discharge, eye rubbing, and conjunctival congestion. Patients' systemic clinical symptoms or cough were associated with ocular symptoms. Ocular symptoms recovered or improved eventually.

Cases of patients with COVID-19 and ocular symptoms and the potential conjunctival transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 have been reported [Br J Ophthalmol. 2020;104(6):748-751]. Nearly all reported cases in previous studies are adults, and little is known about ocular manifestations in children with COVID-19. Ocular signs in children can differ in terms of exposure history, clinical characteristics, and ocular manifestations from those in adults. The authors concluded from this study that 18% of the children presented with ocular complaints as initial symptoms and that most children had mild ocular symptoms that resolved without sequalae. - Mod.UBA]

[The 17th consecutive day with more than 100 newly confirmed cases. In the past 2 weeks, there has been an increase in mortality reported as well. Notices 527 and 528 (the latest analyses of the ongoing outbreak are at https://www.cdc.go.kr/board.es?mid=a30402000000&bid=0030) provide details on clusters as of 00:00 hours 30 Aug 2020. These involve multiple clusters, some faith-based, some school-based, and other areas of work or communal gatherings. Faith-based congregations are the predominant groups with cases, although a hair salon and indoor fitness center have also been associated with clusters. Of the locally transmitted cases, 114 are in Seoul, 77 are in neighboring Gyeonggi province, 30 in Daegu, and 12 are in Incheon. 16 of the 17 provinces have reported locally transmitted cases. Level 2 restrictions are being implemented, with no indoor dining and no in-person church services. - Mod.UBA]

[These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. Lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing, and reported deaths have been increasing as well. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. In Italy and Spain, there are major increases in reported cases. The 24-hour positivity rate in the USA is consistent with continued ongoing significant transmission in the community. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, wearing face masks, handwashing, and the avoidance of large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory for 29 Aug 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug29_1598780368.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 47.4% of daily case numbers and 62.0% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 13.0 million cases. The USA and Brazil still dominate, with Colombia, Mexico, Peru, and Argentina very active as well, as are Bolivia and Guatemala.

- The European region reported 14.2% of daily case numbers and 6.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.1 million. Spain dominates followed by France, Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Turkey, Germany, Italy, Romania, and the United Kingdom. Five western European countries have returned to prominence.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.5% of daily case numbers and 5.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.8 million cases. Iraq still dominates followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates.

- The African region reported 3.0% of daily case numbers and 5.0% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than one million cases. South Africa reported the highest number of cases in the last 24 hours followed by Ethiopia, Algeria, Kenya, Zambia, and Namibia.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.9% of daily case numbers and 2.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.48 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan, South Korea and Australia.

- The South East Asia region reported 28.8% of the daily newly reported cases and 18.8% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.9 million cases. India continues to dominate with reports of over 76 000 cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Nepal.

Impression: The overall picture by region is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions; most noteworthy are the western European countries.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 29 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.UBA]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (78 472), followed by the USA (42 843), and Brazil (34 360) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (60.3%). 5304 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (28-29 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Peru, Colombia, Argentina, France, Mexico, Russia, and Iraq. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 3834 to 78 472. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Philippines, Indonesia, Ukraine, South Africa, Bangladesh, Chile, Iran, Morocco, Turkey, and Israel, and their range of reported new cases is 1465 to 3637. A total of 28 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a small change in the average number of daily reported cases (an increase of 2.0%), while daily reported deaths have decreased 3.9%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect either reporting artifacts seen surrounding weekends or a decrease in reporting.

Impression: Basically unchanged from previous discussions, the SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases, but the 24-hour positivity rate is 11.0%, consistent with ongoing community transmission (see section [4E] above). The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.UBA]
