In response to the moderator's comments (Fri, 1 Oct 1999 16:52:09) regarding
disease notification in general and specifically to his lamentation about
the poor compliance by health workers, I would like to say that the new
Graduate Medical Course at the University of Queensland is placing great
emphasis on the importance of protecting the community as well as the
individual.
As a student in this course, I have just spent a week looking at the dengue
virus serocomplex and its implications for Australia from the viewpoint of
community health. As well as re-enforcing the need for prompt notification
of such disease, much time was spent examining the natural history of the
disease, its vectors, potential reservoirs and methods of reducing infection
by intervention at all levels.
In the past, we have had lectures from representatives of the disease
notification authorities emphasising the limits placed on public health
measures by the poor rate of disease notification, as well as outlining the
improvements to public health possible if incidences of such infections were
known about earlier and thus able to be countered more acutely.
However, in my investigation of Nation-wide disease notification statistics
and protocols I found that there is much discrepancy between states as to
the range of diseases subject to compulsory notification, who is responsible
for the notification (examining Dr., treating Dr., or pathology laboratory),
at what stage of the infection to notify and even what, technically,
constitutes infection with the notifiable disease.
There is also minimal information readily available to most health
practitioners explaining how to notify and what the subsequent response
process is.
Hopefully, as we become more aware of how small the globe really is, we will
more fully realise our responsibility not only to the individual patient in
front of us but also to the community, local and global, that we and our
patients are part of. Rest assured that medical students graduating from
the University of Queensland are aware of these responsibilities.

[In this matter of notifications, Australia sounds much like the USA as far
as "much discrepancy between states" goes. Of course, nobody is going to
bother to notify anything if they donÂ´t even know "how to notify and what
the subsequent response process is." Has anyone any tried & true recipe for
dealing with this problem? - Mod.JW
