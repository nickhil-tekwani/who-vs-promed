More than 40 of the nearly 1000 endangered Key deer living at the National Key Deer Refuge on Big Pine Key [Monroe County] have been euthanized, at least 8 of them between Sunday and Monday [2 and 3 Oct 2016], due to the presence of the [New World] screwworm, said Dan Clark, manager of the National Key Deer Refuge.

The US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service confirmed [Tue 4 Oct 2016] the presence of screwworm at the refuge.

Screwworm flies lay their eggs in the wounds of injured animals, after which the larvae hatch and then feed on the wound as it becomes larger.

"They're in as gory of a condition as you can imagine," Clark said of the infected deer. Staff members started seeing more deer with open sores and lesions infested with fly larvae in September [2016]. "That made us ask a lot of questions."

According to the USDA, which declared an "agricultural state of emergency in Monroe County" on [Mon 3 Oct 2016], this is the 1st local infestation of screwworm in the United States in more than 30 years. Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam H Putnam also declared an "agricultural state of emergency in Monroe County" [Mon 3 Oct 2016].

Many of the deer are infected beyond rehabilitation, at which point they are put down with a bolt gun, a modified pistol with a spring-loaded steel rod that causes mortality quickly after being discharged into the head of the deer, Clark said.

Clark's staff members from the National Wildlife Refuges Complex and others from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and Monroe County Sheriff's Office have been performing the euthanizations, Clark said.

Seeing as how the screwworm fly lays eggs only in the wounds of living animals, carcasses are deposited in a safe spot away from the public where "nature can take its course," he said.

Staff members from the Big Pine complex aren't actively chasing deer, but may encounter an infected deer while performing population surveys or receive a call from someone who sees an injured deer. After the deer is put down, the maggots are removed from the carcass.

Humans can be infected the same way the flies infect animals, according to Clark and area veterinarians. How the fly arrived on Big Pine Key has yet to be determined by the USDA and other agencies.

The screwworm fly is not widely present in the United States, but it is found in most South American countries and in 5 countries in the Caribbean.

The presence of screwworm can be an agricultural nightmare for farmers, Clark said, and would be much more difficult to eradicate had it been discovered in a place such as Texas. "Thankfully, we have the ability to isolate it here," he said.

Federal and state officials will remain at a 24-hour northbound checkpoint in Key Largo at mile marker 106, which was set up on [Mon 3 Oct 2016] to inspect all animals leaving Monroe County for signs of the parasitic fly larvae. They are not pulling all cars over but hope those transporting animals will voluntarily stop to get their animals checked.

[The state of Florida can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4542512,55883.

An excellent article about the screwworm, its infection of live flesh and its eradication can be found at https://www.avma.org/News/Journals/Collections/Documents/javma_228_3_357.pdf. There are some good photos of the larvae and descriptions for recognition. This is really a horrible situation for the animals affected as these larvae consume living tissue and of course the animal can feel these larvae eating its flesh.

Hurricane Matthew is bearing down on Florida and the Keys and as of this writing it is a category 4 hurricane. This could spread the flies hundreds of miles [although the storm is expected to largely spare the Keys - Mod.LM]

Domestic animals of all species are susceptible. Be sure to check your dogs, cats, horse, cattle, and other animals for injuries, and flies and larvae. This is a very serious situation and can cause serious scaring and even death in animals. House pets are just as susceptible as flies can get in the house, especially under stressful weather conditions. This is more than a large animal concern, so everyone is encouraged to read the article cited above and learn what the larvae look like and to be aware of these flies and the larvae invasion of living tissue.

A photo of key deer may be found at https://www.nwf.org/Wildlife/Wildlife-Library/Mammals/Key-Deer.aspx. The Key deer is a subspecies of the white-tailed deer. It once ranged throughout the lower Florida Keys, but now lives primarily in one area called Big Pine Key and surrounding small islands. Currently fewer than 1000 Key deer survive and their future remains precarious.

Screwworm is not helping this matter either. Animals that are debilitated beyond recovery will be euthanized, which further threatens a species so few in number.

I wish to express appreciation to Dr James Alexander of the Texas Department of State Health Services for pointing us to the online JAVMA article and photos.
