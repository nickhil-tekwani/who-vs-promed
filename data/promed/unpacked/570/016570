A mystery illness that has struck down police dogs across the country has begun to affect family pets.

The Herald Sun reported that as of Saturday [24 Mar 2018] at least 3 pet dogs had contracted the disease in addition to 9 police animals, one of which has died.

The rare disease, megaesophagus, slowly closes the throat, making eating and drinking and even breathing increasingly difficult.

People are being warned to keep an eye on their family pets after at least 3 have come down with the mystery illness that killed a police dog, according to the Herald Sun.

Signs of the illness can include bad breath, coughing, extreme weight-loss and more breathing noises.

Nine-year-old Labradoodle Stan has lost almost 5 kilograms (11 pounds) since being diagnosed with megaesophagus and has to rely on intravenous drips for fluids.

Tests are being done to see whether this illness is linked to a dog food brand.

Stan's sitter, JF, is distressed over what is happening to the dog.

He's even built a special chair to hold Stan so he can try to digest his food.

"Try and keep him in there for half an hour till it, you know, half digests, and then he comes out, and he's sick again. It's pretty shocking," JF told 7 News.

Stan's owners told the Sunday Herald Sun: "[The vet] pretty much told us that there won't be a good outcome."

Tests are being done to see whether the illness is linked to the Advanced Dermocare dry dog food range, but it has since been removed from the shelves

Pet owners are urged to not give the Advanced Dermocare dry dog food range to their pets due to concerns about megaesophagus, which has struck down 9 Victoria Police squad dogs. Another 2 are expected to be euthanised. Australian dog food brands used by police handlers are now under heavy scrutiny.

Mars Petcare Australia is cooperating with the investigation and has voluntarily recalled Advance Dermocare dry dog food products in 3kg, 8kg and 15kg bags.

"We advise dog owners who have purchased this product to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund," the company stated on its website.

"These bags will have been purchased from specialty retailers and veterinarians. No other Advance products or varieties are affected. The health and wellbeing of Australian pets is our number one priority, so we were deeply concerned to learn that a number of dogs have been affected by megaoesophagus, a condition that is generally not associated with food."

The company says it has run "hundreds of tests" on its dog food range and has found no link between the condition and the product.

"Regardless, we are voluntarily recalling these products as a precaution while we work to get to the bottom of the issue as soon as we can," the company stated on its website.

"We will continue to provide information to University of Melbourne to enable further testing and consult with the Australian Veterinary Association. We understand Australian pet owners may be worried. Concerned pet owners should contact their veterinarian or our consumer care team on 1800 640 111."

Animal Welfare Victoria urged concerned pet owners to speak with their vet.

Vet experts probing the cause of the illness affecting both the Victoria Police squad's German shepherds and Labradors, say food is a "common factor" between the 9 infected canines.

The sick dogs from Victoria Police contracted the debilitating condition in December 2018 and are still battling the "extremely rare illness." So far, one dog has died, and the other 8 remain unwell with varying levels of illness.

Inspector Jon Woodyatt from the Dog Squad told 3AW that although each dog has its own specific diet requirements, food is not being ruled out as a contributing factor.

Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia the diagnosis of 9 dogs in one incident is extremely rare, and they are still figuring out the cause of the condition

"At this stage, we're told there was a number of common factors which we are looking at. One of them does include the food that we're feeding the dogs," he said. "We're told having this number of dogs with this condition is pretty much unheard of in veterinary circles. We are saddened that one police dog has been put down as a result of the condition, which can hamper adequate nutrition."

[This is a very strange case. Megesophagus can be hereditary, but this article does not mention whether all the dogs are the same breed or related. The breed of the dog or cat may play a role in the development of this condition. Breeds recognized as most susceptible to this condition include:
- German shepherd
- Newfoundland
- Great Dane
- Irish setter
- Shar-pei
- Greyhound
- Labrador retriever
- Siamese cats

Megaesophagus is not a single disease. Instead it is considered a combination disorder in which the esophagus (the tube that carries food and liquid between the mouth and stomach) dilates and loses motility (its ability to move food into the stomach). When esophageal motility is decreased or absent, food and liquid accumulate in the esophagus.

When the esophagus is functioning normally, food in the mouth stimulates nerves that send signals to the swallowing center in the brainstem which in turn stimulates the swallow reflex. There are several key locations along the various nerve pathways at which a malfunction can cause megaesophagus. Megaesophagus is the most common cause of regurgitation in dogs and cats.

Myasthenia gravis (MG), caused by autoantibody production against nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions, is common and responsible for up to 30 percent of cases. When this is the cause of the megaesophagus, pyridostigmine bromide may be a very helpful treatment. The pet should be monitored for autoantibodies when on this drug but may be on this drug for its lifetime.

In many cases of megaesophagus, the precise cause is never completely understood. Congenital and primary acquired megaesophagus in adults fall into this category.

Some forms of acquired megaesophagus occur secondary to another disease or condition including:
- A failure of the connection between the nerves and muscles of the esophagus
- Degeneration or trauma in the brain or spinal cord
- A blockage of the esophagus by a foreign body, tumor, or scar tissue
- Severe inflammation of the esophagus
- Hormonal disease - e.g. hypothyroidism or hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's disease)
- Exposure to a toxin

Acquired forms of megesophagus may involve gastrointestinal, endocrine, immune-mediated, neuromuscular, paraneoplastic, and toxic disorders have been associated with acquired megaesophagus.

Megaesophagus secondary to a toxin should be considered in dogs with a history of exposure to any of the following toxins and/or who are showing signs of toxicosis with any of the following toxins.

Botulism
Botulism (_Clostridium botulinum_) results from the ingestion of preformed _Clostridium botulinum_ type C neurotoxin contained in carrion or spoiled foodstuffs. Signs can appear from a few hours to 6 days after toxin ingestion. The botulism toxin causes megaesophagus with regurgitation as well as acute flaccid paralysis with retention of tail wagging.

Tetanus
Tetanus (_Clostridium tetani_) typically results when the spores are introduced through a wound, puncture or parturition. Signs typically occur from five days to three weeks after exposure. Animals with tetanus can develop megaesophagus and an esophageal hiatal hernia, and there is a risk of regurgitation and aspiration pneumonia secondary to megaesophagus.

Lead Toxicosis
Lead is a heavy metal that can cause gastrointestinal and neurologic signs. Megaesophagus has been reported rarely as a sequelae in cats with chronic lead toxicosis.

Organophosphate Toxicosis
Organophosphate toxicosis has been reported to cause megaesophagus in llamas. It could be considered as a rule out in animals with OP exposure, or those showing SLUDDE or nicotinic signs.

Thallium Toxicosis
Thallium is a heavy metal. Ingestion of mycoplasma agar plates is the most common cause of thallium toxicosis, since thallium-based pesticides were banned in the US in 1972.

Thallium typically causes alopecia, hyperkeratosis, GI upset, cataracts and neuronal dysfunction. In cats it can also cause hepatotoxicity and bone marrow suppression.

Case reports have been published detailing megaesophagus and aspiration pneumonia. In one case, the megaesophagus persisted for 10 months.

Australian Tiger Snake Envenomation
Australian tiger snake (_Notechis scutatus_) is native to Australia and Tasmania. It is a highly venomous elapid capable of causing paralysis, myalgia, hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, and renal failure.

A published report with four cases of megaesophagus in dogs shows that in the 3 dogs who survived, the megaesophagus resolved. The pathogenesis is unknown, but it is thought that myonecrosis of striated muscle may be the cause, rather than neuropathy, due to a lack of other neuropathic signs.

Megaesophagus has not been reported in cats with Australian Tiger Snake envomation, possibly because their esophagus contains smooth muscle, which is not affected by the myotoxic components of the venom.

Treatment of this condition should be focused on management of feeding to prevent aspiration pneumonia. For dogs with dysautonomia or idiopathic megaesophagus, the prognosis is poor. Some clinicians believe a subpopulation of idiopathic dogs have seronegative MG and advocate treating idiopathic patients as MG patients. For those dogs with documented MG, clinical remission may occur anywhere from 1 month to 1 year, and most dogs regain esophageal tone. Dogs with megaesophagus secondary to other diseases may also regain tone and improve if the primary disease is addressed.

In the case of supposed toxin, identification of and removal of the toxin is needed and if there is a specific treatment/antidote for the toxin this would be appropriate.

It is highly unusual for a dog food to cause this, so a further investigation of this situation seems warranted.
