Regional surveillance
---------------------
Outbreak of cases of tickborne encephalitis [TBE] linked to the consumption of raw milk goat cheese Ain, April-May 2020

Epidemiological update as of 4 Jun 2020
---------------------------------------
Doctors from Oyonnax and Bourg-en-Bresse hospitals reported to the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes regional health agency that they had been treating several patients with viral-looking lymphocytic meningitis but without etiology identified since 10 May 2020. The main bacterial and viral causes of neuro-meningeal infection had been excluded. An investigation was put in place at once with the help of emergency physicians, EMT [emergency medical technician], and infectious disease specialists from the 2 hospitals, virologists and bacteriologists from the Hospices Civils de Lyon and the National Reference Center for Arboviruses in Marseille, the Regional Health and Health Agency France. The investigation of this outbreak of tickborne encephalitis in people living in the Ain department [a department is an administrative division of France] is currently being carried out.

Since 1 Apr 2020, 32 cases of lymphocytic meningitis, encephalitis, and infectious syndromes have been identified in a limited area of the Ain department in people living in the municipality of Oyonnax, within a radius of about 30 km [19 mi]. The epidemic peak of cases occurred during the week of 20-26 Apr 2020. Among these 32 cases, infection with the TBE virus was confirmed by the National Arbovirus Reference Center on 27 May 2020 for 14 cases. This virus is the agent responsible for tickborne encephalitis. The remaining 18 cases are under investigation and biological tests are being carried out to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of tickborne encephalitis.

The average age of the confirmed cases is 48 years, and 17 (53%) are women; 28 cases were hospitalized or seen in the ER [emergency room], 2 of which were admitted to ICU. One possible patient with co-morbidities has died. Among the cases investigated, the most frequently reported symptoms were: fever (78%), headache (52%), myalgia (35%), dizziness (30%), asthenia (21%), diarrhea (13%), vomiting (13%), impaired alertness (9%), and tremors (9%).

Of the 32 cases, 31 (97%) said they ate goat cheese made from raw milk from the same cheese maker of that area. The dietary cause of these infections was confirmed on 2 Jun 2020 by the National Arbovirus Reference Center. The presence of the genome of the TBE virus was identified in a goat cheese from the cheese maker. Dairy products from this cheese maker were recalled and removed from the shelves before the results of the tests came back. Veterinary investigations are under way. This outbreak of cases of tickborne encephalitis linked to food consumption is the first identified in France. However, the documentation of cases of tickborne encephalitis is not new in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. A few cases are reported each year in the Annecy region since 2003 and more recently in the Livradois-Forez National Park with 3 cases reported in the departments of Loire and Haute-Loire in the summers of 2017 and 2018.

Epidemiological situation of tickborne encephalitis in France
-------------------------------------------------------------
Tickborne encephalitis is a rare disease in France. Tickborne encephalitis is caused by a virus (Flavivirus) that is mainly transmitted to humans through the bite of an infested tick, mainly from spring through fall (period of tick activity). There are 3 types of this virus: European, Far Eastern, and Siberian. The European subtype, the only one present in France, is responsible for less serious illnesses than the other two. Around 5000 to 13 000 cases of tickborne encephalitis are reported each year in the world. Very rare in France, the tickborne encephalitis is currently raging in Europe, north of Japan, and China, between the 40th and 60th parallels. Little is known about the epidemiological situation in France. About 20 cases are diagnosed per year, mainly in Alsace and Haute-Savoie, or contracted abroad, in connection with leisure activities, in humid wooded areas (campers, hikers, mushroom pickers, hunters, etc). In Europe, the Czech Republic, Germany, and the Baltic countries are the most affected.

Transmission of the tickborne encephalitis virus occurs through the bite of an infected tick, regardless of its stage of development. Vertebrate animals that are infected or carry ticks, such as cattle, for example, do not usually transmit the disease directly to humans. Exceptionally, contamination can occur through consumption of raw milk or cheese made from raw goat's or sheep's milk. This transmission has never been observed in France before. Certain professional activities are more at risk because of exposure to tick bites: people who work in the forest or in rural areas, in regions where the virus is present: loggers, farmers, foresters, gamekeepers. However, the risk exists for everyone going out in the woods for leisure activities.

Preventive measures: wear protective clothing with long sleeves and check for tick bites after returning outdoor activities. There are 2 tickborne encephalitis vaccines in France. Vaccination against tickborne encephalitis is recommended for adult and children who travel to high-incidence countries as it reduces the risk of contracting the disease. After an incubation period of 1-2 weeks, TBE presents suddenly with fever, headache, muscle and joints pains. Between 20-30% of patients develop these symptoms as TBE infects the central nervous system (encephalitis, myelitis) resulting in peripheral paresis or paralysis of a limb.

The clinical signs are prostration or restlessness, tremors, behavioral disturbances, sensory disturbances, sometimes convulsions or coma. Death is rare with the European viral subtype less than 1% of deaths, but up to 40% of cases can experience aftereffects (mainly paralysis and behavioral disorders). There is no specific antiviral medication for this disease. Treatment is only symptomatic. The recovery period can be long, with long-term neurological or psychiatric aftereffects.

Tickborne encephalitis: 1st description of a foodborne outbreak in France
------------------------------------------------------------------
Raw goat milk cheeses are believed to be the source of a tickborne encephalitis case in residents of the Ain department, according to the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes regional health agency and the departmental prefecture. It is the 1st time that an outbreak of foodborne tickborne encephalitis has been described in France. The transmission of this disease by unpasteurized dairy products seems to be on the rise in recent years in Europe.

On 28 May [2020], the announcement of an outbreak of confirmed or likely tickborne encephalitis (TBE) (10 cases including one death which does not seem to be directly linked to this viral disease) among 26 people in Ain, by the regional health agency Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and the prefecture of Ain, was especially surprising due to the exceptional nature of the origin of the infection: cheeses made from raw goat milk from a farm in the municipality of Oyonnax (these products would have been consumed by at least 50% of sick people).

Indeed, TBE is one of the most important viral zoonoses transmitted by the bite of an infected tick. It is caused by a flavivirus (tickborne encephalitis virus or TBEV). There are 3 main subtypes of TBEV (European, Siberian, and Far East), the European subtype being transmitted mainly by the tick _Ixodes ricinus_ (_I. persulcatus_ transmitting the other subtypes).

Food transmission through the consumption of unpasteurized milk or dairy product from an infected ruminant, considered to be rare, had never been described in France until this recent suspicion. Laboratory contamination by injection or aerosols is also possible.

As in the case of another flavivirosis due to the agent of ovine encephalomyelitis (or louping ill), close to TBEV, tickborne encephalitis is asymptomatic in 75% of cases.

When there are symptoms, a characteristic biphasic evolution is observed. After an incubation period of about 8 days, the first clinical phase results in non-specific flu-like symptoms for 2 to 4 days (hyperthermia, fatigue and muscle pain). These symptoms led doctors to suspect COVID-19 in the Ain.

Then, after an asymptomatic week, nervous disorders can appear in a third of patients, varying from moderate meningitis to severe encephalitis or meningo-encephalo-myelo-radiculitis. The mortality rate varies from 1 to 2% with the European strain of TBEV. Nervous system sequelae (cognitive impairment) can be seen in almost 10% of patients.

Tickborne encephalitis steadily increasing in Europe
----------------------------------------------------
From 1990 to 1994, there was an increase in cases of TBE in the European Economic Community, perhaps due to increased surveillance, then, from 1995 to 2009, a certain stability, with 2000 to 4000 declared cases per year. In 2012, it became mandatory to report the disease accompanied by nervous disorders in the European Union. A survey concerning the TBE was carried out from 2012 to 2016 in Europe: 23 countries in the European Union reported 12 500 cases of TBE (Ireland and Spain did not report any cases), including 93% confirmed (11 623) and 7% likely (783). The Netherlands reported cases starting in 2016 and 2 countries (Czech Republic and Lithuania) accounted for 38.6% of all reported cases, despite a workforce representing only 2.7% of the population under surveillance.

The annual notification rate fluctuated between 0.41 cases per 100 000 inhabitants in 2015 and 0.65 in 2013, without any significant change. Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia had the highest reporting rates with 15.6, 9.5 and 8.7 cases per 100 000 inhabitants. At the subnational level, 6 regions had average annual reporting rates above 15 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, including 5 in the Baltic countries.

About 95% of cases were hospitalized and the overall mortality rate was 0.5%. Of the 11 663 cases reported with information on import status, 156 (1.3%) were declared imported. Less than 2% of cases had received 2 or more doses of the TBE vaccine.

The latest report from the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC, 2019) announced the 1st cases of TBE described in Denmark and 3212 cases of TBE in Europe in 2018, of which 96.3% were confirmed (25 in France). A search for TBEV and louping ill virus (LIV), carried out between 2018 and 2019 on 1309 deer in England and Scotland, showed that TBEV was also present in the United Kingdom. The countries most affected were Lithuania, Slovenia and the Czech Republic, with 13.6, 7.4, and 6.7 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, while the European average was 0.6 per 100 000 as in the previous 3 years.

Compared with the 2017 data, the number of reported cases doubled in Slovakia and increased by 22.4% in Germany. In endemic regions, vaccination has shown a decrease in the number of cases (by 23.2% in Lithuania in 2018).

Increase in cases in France in 2016
-----------------------------------
Several countries had reported the increase in cases of TBE in their territory, in particular Switzerland, which notified 251 cases at the end of October 2019 from 100 annual cases declared during the last 5 years. In France, where the first human case was identified in 1968, we have mainly observed a dozen cases per year in the Alsatian region, then, from 2003, one or 2 cases in Haute-Savoie and, in 2006, a 1st case in the South-West (1 case per 100 000 inhabitants).

A significant increase in TBE cases in France was observed in 2016: 54 cases, including 46 with nervous disorders (9 patients suffered aftereffects for the next 15 days to 8 months) and a serological survey showing 5.89% seropositive out of 1643 blood samples.

The Alsatian region went from 0.5 cases to 1.33 cases per 100 000 inhabitants.

Several epidemiological factors
-------------------------------
There are several factors that favor the occurrence of TBE. Most often, these are the same known risks for Lyme disease (tick bite) but the dietary origin of a TBE may have been underestimated in recent years.

- Geographic region
Surveillance of the TBE has made it possible to define highly endemic regions (more than 5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants per year).

The Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovenia are highly endemic areas (incidence higher than 10 per 100 000 inhabitants). TBE is also a major problem in Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary.

TBE incidences vary considerably, not only between countries but also within regions, such as in Sweden, Finland, Austria, northern Switzerland, or southern Germany.

- Season, regions, occupational or occasional risk
Cases of TBE appear during the tick activity period, namely the hot season from April to November with a peak of activity in the plains (April to June) and in the mountains (May-July).

Due to the presence of ticks in hedges, forests, and gardens, the risk for humans can be professional (foresters, gardeners) or linked to outdoor activities (camping, parks, hiking).

- Age and sex of those infected
Most of those infected are between 45 and 64 years of age (36%, or 0.8 cases per 100 000 inhabitants); men are often more affected than women.

- Imported cases
Cases can sometimes be imported: 65, or 2.2% in 2018 in Europe.

- Immunization
Of the 881 cases of TBE observed in 2018 in Europe for which the administration of a vaccine was or was not known, 856 people (97%) had not been vaccinated.

- Consumption of raw milk or dairy products
A study in the Czech Republic (endemic area of TBE) showed that almost 1% of the cases of TBE (where the unvaccinated person did not remember having been bitten by a tick) were of food origin, mainly unpasteurized goat milk; children have a 2.5 times higher risk of infection than adults.

More recently, an investigation in Slovakia confirmed the risk linked to goat milk in endemic areas.

The transmission of TBE by unpasteurized dairy products seems to have increased in recent years in Europe. A recent Norwegian study, concerning 112 cow's milk samples analyzed by RT-PCR, made it possible to note the presence of TBEV in 5.4% of the samples (further studies are necessary to check if these milk products can be infectious).

The cows corresponding to these positive samples were negative when searching for neutralizing serum antibodies while 15 cows, out of 17 tested in the Arendal region, were positive for this antibody search (but negative for their milk). The Arendal region is also the one where the rates of notified TBE are the highest.

This risk linked to unpasteurized dairy products in regions infested with ticks and where cases of TBE are reported shows that an evaluation of the dietary risk is necessary to possibly define preventive measures. This concerns people with TBE who do not remember having been bitten by a tick (although a tick bite may have actually occurred).

Preventive measures to be implemented
-------------------------------------
- Vaccination
Vaccination is recommended for everyone from the age of one in endemic areas (at least 5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants), which is not the case in France.

This vaccination can only be recommended for French people planning to travel to high risk areas. It can also be recommended for personnel handling TBEV in laboratories.

- Preventive measures in tick-rich areas
Preventive measures in tick-rich areas are those usually recommended to prevent tickborne diseases, especially Lyme disease:
- reduce the likelihood of being bitten by ticks;
- stay on the trails and walk to the center of them;
- wear protective clothing with long sleeves and pants [trousers] tucked into socks;
- wear clothes treated with insecticide; wearing impregnated clothing for a short period of time (weeks or months) is safe and probably also safe for long-term use;
- application of insect repellents to bare skin.

It is possible to remove ticks with tweezers after outdoor activities, but it does not protect against TBE. However, this measure remains important if done early as ticks can harbor other pathogens.

Additional precautions in endemic countries
-------------------------------------------
The consumption of unpasteurized milk and dairy products (from goats, sheep, or cows) in risk areas should be avoided.

The reports above provide additional details about the TBE cases in France and their goat cheese source. The reports also provide a broad overview of TBE in France and in Europe in general. The 2nd report also contains relevant references that can be accessed at the source URL. The increasing TBE incidence in Europe is of significant public health concern. Individuals working in or visiting gardens or forests in areas of higher incidence should be vaccinated and observe the recommended precautions to avoid tick bites. - Mod.TY]
