https://bdnews24.com/health/2020/01/04/experts-advise-not-to-panic-over-swine-flu-after-death-of-ex-mp


The death of Fazilatun Nasa Bappy has triggered fresh fears over swine flu [influenza A/H1N1] in Bangladesh, but experts have urged the people to follow health safety rules instead of panicking.

Bappy, a former Awami League MP [Member of Parliament] from the seats reserved for women, died at the Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University [BSMMU] on [Thu 2 Jan 2020], 4 days after the doctors put her on life support. The 49-year-old was admitted to the hospital on [28 Dec 2019] with a combination of pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.

Tests found she was H1N1 positive, according to Professor AKM Akhtaruzzaman, the chairman of the BSMMU's Intensive Care Unit. "She contracted swine flu virus," the doctor told bdnews24.com on [Fri 3 Jan 2020].

The hospital authorities have urged all not to panic, saying that there are vaccines for the disease. Prof. ABM Abdullah, a former dean of the BSMMU's medicine department, told bdnews24.com patients suffering from the disease recover "most of the times."

Patients with problems in the respiratory system or lungs, those who have diabetes, pregnant women, children aged between 6 months and 5 years, and people older than 65 years are more vulnerable to swine flu, he said. "There is nothing to panic over swine flu. But there is also no room to take it lightly," he added.

The H1N1 influenza virus was 1st reported in April 2009 in Mexico before spreading across the globe. The World Health Organization [WHO] declared a global H1N1 flu pandemic on [11 Jun 2009].

Bangladesh's 1st case was detected on [18 Jun 2009] amid a global outbreak, which created panic. When the virus was detected in Bangladesh again in 2013, doctors said swine flu became a "seasonal influenza" (H1N1) in Bangladesh like the other 2 viruses -- influenza B and [influenza A/H3N2].

A combined vaccine against these 3 viruses is available, meaning a single shot can help high-risk groups like pregnant women, [people with] uncontrolled [diabetes], and cancer patients. Fever, runny nose, sore throat, and cough followed by breathing difficulty are some of the symptoms of swine flu.

Maintaining personal hygiene, especially washing hands and the crook of one's elbow with soap, [is] advised to prevent any flu.

Respiratory transmission occurs mainly by droplets disseminated by unprotected coughs and sneezes, according to the WHO. Short-distance airborne transmission of influenza viruses may occur, particularly in crowded enclosed spaces.

Hand contamination and direct inoculation of virus is another possible source of transmission, which is why experts advise caution while taking care of swine flu patients.

Meerjady Sabrina Flora, a director at the government's disease control agency IEDCR [Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research], said swine flu affects people regularly in Bangladesh now as it transmits from person to person, a way in which Bappy "might have contracted the virus."

She also said those returning from Europe or China or Korea should consult doctors if any symptom of swine flu is found in them, as it is the swine flu season there. "We can do the tests as well and give advice for free. Tests and treatment are also available outside," she added.

A surge in flu cases has pushed the Miami Valley Hospital emergency department to capacity, according to a spokeswoman. Doctors at Miami Valley are urging patients with flu symptoms to 1st contact their primary care provider or go to an urgent care for non-emergency flu cases.

Dr. Ryan Babienco, an emergency medicine physician, said people who are not having severe symptoms such as shortness of breath can likely be treated at home or can call their family doctor or visit an urgent care if your provider isn't available.

"That's the appropriate place to be treated if you are not experiencing some of the more severe symptoms, especially the one we worry about the most is that real bad shortness of breath where you're coughing and coughing and you can't walk across the room," Babienco said.

When the emergency department is at capacity, all patients are still seen but patients with less serious symptoms have long waits while patients with more critical needs are seen.

At Grandview Medical Center, also in Dayton, a spokeswoman said Friday [3 Jan 2020] afternoon that the hospital "is experiencing a surge in flu cases today, but they are managing the increase in patients."

Symptoms of flu can include fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. Flu vaccination is available at most healthcare providers' offices, local health departments and retail pharmacies. There are no flu vaccine shortages across Ohio.

Flu vaccines are encouraged for everyone 6 months and older. Other ways to avoid getting or spreading the flu include washing hands frequently or using alcohol-based hand sanitizer; covering coughs and sneezes with tissues or coughing or sneezing into elbows; avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth; and staying home when sick.

"Getting the flu vaccine is the safest and most effective way to prevent the flu for everyone 6 months and older," said Dr. Mark Hurst, Ohio Department of Health medical director. "Flu hospitalizations could still be on the rise. You need to protect yourself, your friends and your family and get a flu shot now if you haven't already."

The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that healthcare providers prescribe one of 2 antiviral drugs as a 2nd line of defense as soon as possible to patients with confirmed or suspected influenza who are hospitalized, have severe illness, or may be at higher risk for flu complications.

"These antiviral medications can reduce the severity of the flu and prevent serious flu complications," Hurst said. "They work best when started within 2 days of getting sick."

From [22-28 Dec 2019], there were 387 new influenza-associated hospitalizations reported in Ohio. There have been 1003 flu-associated hospitalizations reported in Ohio so far this flu season compared with 555 reported during the same time period last year [2019]. Flu activity typically peaks between December and February.

On Friday [3 Jan 2020], Ohio Department of Health reported the state's 1st flu-associated pediatric death of the 2019-2020 flu season, a 16-year-old girl from Cuyahoga County.

https://www.prescottenews.com/index.php/news/current-news/item/34663-yavapai-county-with-84-confirmed-cases-of-flu


Flu activity is now widespread in 48 states, including Arizona. Arizona has had 6816 confirmed cases, and Yavapai County has had 84 confirmed cases. Compared to last year [2019], this season seems to be affecting young people more prevalently -- the 5- to 18-year-old age-group is almost double -- while [the age-group] 50 and older is half to a quarter of last year.

Here's what to do if you or someone you're caring for gets sick:
Steps to take if you get the flu
--------------------------------
- If you get very sick, are pregnant, or are 65 years or older, or are otherwise at high risk of flu-related complications, call your doctor. You might need antiviral drugs to treat flu.
- Stay at home and rest.
- Avoid close contact with well people in your house so you won't make them sick.
- Drink plenty of water and other clear liquids to prevent fluid loss (dehydration).

When caring for people who have the flu
---------------------------------------
- Avoid being face to face with the sick person. If possible, it is best to spend the least amount of time in close contact with a sick person.
- When holding sick children, place their chin on your shoulder so they will not cough in your face.
- Wash your hands often and right way.
- If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub.
- Make sure to wash your hands after touching the sick person. Wash after handling their tissues or laundry.

https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/01/04/pennsylvania-battles-recent-surge-in-flu-cases/


So far, there are over 17 000 flu cases in Pennsylvania. More than one-third are in the southwestern Pennsylvania region. Allegheny County now has 4099 cases, Beaver County has 976 cases and Westmoreland County currently has 1099 cases, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health.

Dr. Brent Rau works in the emergency room at Allegheny General Hospital (AGH). "Part of that is the weather right now. As it gets colder, people are huddling together indoors, and we end up with people sharing the same illness," Dr. Rau said. "We also have a pretty high elderly population here in the Pittsburgh and Allegheny County area particularly, and they're more prone to developing this as well."

It's only early January [2020], and the flu season is off to one of its fastest starts ever. Hospitals like AGH and others throughout the region are admitting and treating more patients.

Dr. Rau advises some common sense measures if you have flu-like symptoms: stay at home, always wash your hands, cover your mouth when you cough and drink plenty of liquids. He's not as worried about people with strong immune systems and in good health as much as younger children and the elderly with certain illnesses, who are more susceptible to the virus.

"It's certainly scary if you have a patient population that has cancer, undergoing chemotherapy that are already [fighting with] a suppressed immune system when they develop the flu."

So far, the overwhelming majority of influenza cases are type B. Dr. Rau says it varies year to year with more type A cases down south, but it's too early to tell.

"A lot of times what it ends up being is that we start with one, they start with the other and they kind of flip. That might be the way it is this year [2020]," Dr. Rau said. He reminds everyone that it is not too late to get a flu shot, saying you can't get the flu from a flu shot.

https://www.connexionfrance.com/index.php/French-news/Gastro-epidemic-worsens-in-France-as-flu-confirmed-in-pre-epidemic-stage-and-bronchiolitis-spreads


[Public Health] France has said that 6 regions of the 13 on mainland France are in a stage of "pre-epidemic" for flu: Bourgogne-Franche-Comte, Brittany, Ile-de-France, Occitanie, Pays de la Loire, and Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur.

Flu has not spread much this year [2020] compared to last year [2019], with just 51 doctor consultations per 100 000 inhabitants reported over the Christmas week. Yet, worse is predicted, as in 2019, the flu season reached its peak in mid-February.

Symptoms include a high fever, severe aches and pains, a dry cough, sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, exhaustion, and difficulty sleeping. While most people recover within 1 or 2 weeks, the condition can be very serious for vulnerable people: At the height of a 2-week "epidemic" phase in 2019, more than 8100 people died from the illness.

https://www.thesun.ie/news/4951599/mercy-university-hospital-cork-bans-visitor-flu-outbreak/


People have been banned from visiting patients at the Mercy University Hospital (MUH) in Cork after an outbreak of influenza. Visitor restrictions are also in place at Cork University Hospital, The Mater Hospital and University Hospital Waterford.

A Mercy University Hospital spokesman said: "The risk is to patients from visitors, because of the virulence of flu in the community." All visitors have been banned [except] for in exceptional circumstances. The notice came into effect at 8:30 pm on Friday [3 Jan 2020], and the situation being reviewed on a daily basis.

The ban does not include people visiting young patients, those who are critically ill or those being treated in the intensive care unit. The MUH said: "Visiting is prohibited to the hospital in the interest of patient safety and the hospital is seeking the public's co-operation with the restrictions."

In September [2019], the HSE [Ireland's national health service] had urged people to the get seasonal flu jab, which protects against 4 strains of the flu virus. The health service [recommends] that people get the new vaccine each year because the flu viruses which affect people change each year.

The flu vaccine works by helping the immune system produce antibodies to fight the influenza virus. If a person has been vaccinated and they come into contact with the virus, these antibodies will attack it and stop the person from getting sick. The flu vaccine doesn't contain any live viruses and therefore it cannot give people the flu.

[8] Vaccination impact

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cid/ciz1238/5696795?redirectedFrom=fulltext


Data from 8 influenza seasons in Australia reveal an overall flu vaccine effectiveness of 31% against mortality for hospital-related flu -- but with a wide confidence interval -- and no evidence of reduced flu symptoms tied to vaccination, according to a study published today [6 Jan 2020] in Clinical Infectious Diseases.

Researchers collected data from 2010 through 2017 from a national Australian hospital-based sentinel surveillance system and used a case-control design for the study. Over those seasons, 14 038 patients were admitted to a hospital with lab-confirmed flu.

The primary analysis, which included 9298 cases and 6451 controls (those without lab-confirmed flu) found that overall vaccine protection against mortality was 31%, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 3% to 51%. The authors found no evidence, however, that the flu vaccine reduced the severity of influenza illness. They report that 84% of the patients in the study were at increased risk of severe outcomes.

The authors conclude, "This study reinforces the public health benefit of the influenza immunisation program in protecting against mortality, as well as reducing the risk of hospitalization." They say the findings are similar to the results of a 2015 longitudinal study involving elderly patients in France.
