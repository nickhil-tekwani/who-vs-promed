Avian influenza Â­ situation in Cambodia
---------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Cambodia has announced a new confirmed case of
human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.

A 19 year old male, from Kandal Province, developed symptoms on 28 Nov 2008
and initially sought medical attention at a local health centre on 30 Nov
2008. The presence of the H5N1 virus was confirmed by the National
Influenza Centre, the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia, on Thu 11 Dec 2008. The
patient is currently hospitalised and a team led by the Ministry of Health
is conducting field investigations into the source of his infection.
Contacts of the case are also being identified and provided with prophylaxis.

Of the 8 cases confirmed to date in Cambodia, 7 have been fatal.
