With recent publicity about high levels of arsenic in the water in certain
areas of India, this would seem to be a quickly testable alternative. The
cause may not be infectious.

[Beats me how arsenic in the water can affect newborns' joints. If
the hypothesis is that they get it from their mother's milk, how does
it act so quickly, and why don't the mothers have symptoms but the
attending physicians do? - Mod.JW

Given the variety of sources of infectious arthritis now reported in the
literature, it is very possible that more than one fungus, bacterium or
mycobacterium could be involved in the outbreak, particularly since some
agents can be airborne. You had described thorough disinfection of the
unit, so re-infection by non-symptomatic personnel, or by air flow
patterns, might be considered. As you may be aware, Merchant et al.'s
abstract (which follows below) closely resembles your situation in the
development of symptoms in neonate lower extremities over similar probable
incubation periods.

ABSTRACT
J Trop Pediatr 1997 Apr;43(2):106-108
Nursery outbreak of neonatal fungal arthritis treated with fluconazole.
Merchant RH, Sanghvi KP, Sridhar N, Sonigara S, Mehta KP, Joshi NC
Division of Neonatology, Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital, Parel, Bombay,
India.
Eight preterm infants with mean gestational age of 31.6 +/- 1.16 weeks and
a mean birth weight of 1310 +/- 201.7 g presented at a mean postnatal age
of 26 +/- 11.4 days with knee joint swellings and pedal oedema. There was
no other clinical, haematological or microbiological evidence of bacterial
sepsis. Fungal cultures yielded growth of Candida spp. from blood in five,
from urine in four, from cerebrospinal fluid in one, and from all the three
babies in whom the joints were aspirated. Radiographic changes of
metaphysitis of the involved joints were noted in all. All infants had
received prior antibiotic therapy. No infant had received total parenteral
nutrition or had central lines inserted. All infants were treated with
fluconazole in doses of 7.5 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks. Six of eight were
thriving well at 3 months of age without any evidence of residual joint
disease. One infant succumbed to disseminated disease and one was lost to
follow-up. Candidial arthritis is an uncommon presentation of neonatal
candidiasis. Fluconazole therapy proved effective.

Recently I read an article in the pediatric ID journal discussing _Ureaplasma
urealyticum_ arthritis in patients with agammaglobulinemia, and while this
is not necessarily your patient population, it might be worth looking for,
as routine culture methods would not pick this up.
_Yersinia enterocolytica_ has also been reported to be associated with GI
problems and arthritis but I believe you would isolate it on routine culture.
I don't think Candida is a very likely cause of arthritis in adults and
would expect
_S. aureus_ to be causing a lot of other problems, so seems like a mystery
to me.
Good luck with this problem.

I've run this problem through GIDEON. Assuming an infectious disease in
India characterized by: 1) culture-negative arthritis; 2) absence of
rash; 3) additional cases in adults,...a viral etiology seems likely.
Candidates include Parvovirus 19, Chikungunya, Sindbis and Hepatitis B.
Additional positive and negative clinical / laboratory findings would be
helpful.

[Unless the hospital is full of mosquitoes, you can rule out chikungunya
(note lower case "l") & Sindbis, which are only known to be transmitted by
mosquitoes or lab accident - Mod.JW
