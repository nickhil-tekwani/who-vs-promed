Some 1200 people in northeastern Hungary have fallen ill from drinking
contaminated water, the director of national epidemic affairs said Mon 12
Jun 2006. Flooding caused by heavy spring rainfall contaminated the spring
water that flows into the city water system, experts said.
On Thu 8 Jun 2006, residents of the city of Miskolc, some 160 km (100
miles) northeast of Budapest, began showing 1st symptoms of bacterial
poisoning [without a diagnosis, it might be best referred to as
gastroenteritis - Mod.LL], falling ill with diarrhea, vomiting and fatigue.
The number of sick in Miskolc escalated to 1200 on Mon 12 Jun 2006, with 80
patients treated at a hospital there, Lajos Ocsai, the epidemic affairs
director, said.
Water experts advised all residents to use tap water strictly for cooking
and to drink bottled water only. While workers decontaminate the system,
water trucks are providing household supplies. Children in schools are
being provided with drinking water.

[ProMED thanks Christian Griot for alerting us to this outbreak.
The etiology of this large cluster of gastrointestinal illness, thought to
be water-borne, is unclear. Viruses, bacteria and toxins are all
possibilities, and there is no mention of the length of illness, presence
of fever or any diagnostic testing. ProMED would appreciate further
information in this regard.
