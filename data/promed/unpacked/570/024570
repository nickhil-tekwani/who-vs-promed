----------------------------------------------------------------------
If this can be of any help, I have made this alternative translation of the Ministry of Health's announcement, which was weirdly dated 26 Sep 2013, a day before the patient died. And what can be highlighted is that there is a more-than-24-hours gap between the time when the physician suspected that the patient had bird flu and his referral to the better equipped hospital. It shows that the health community had let down their guard, perhaps because previously there is only one bird flu case this year [2013] (and it was September already). Here's my translation:

Bird flu case report no 194
---------------------------
The Ministry of Health Republic of Indonesia, Directorate General of Disease Control and Environmental Health announced one new H5N1 case that had been confirmed by the Health Biomedic and Basic Technology Center, Health Research and Development Agency.

The patient was a 28-year-old male, resident of Cibitung Sub District, Bekasi District, West Java Province, who worked as a driver in a bottled drinking water company.

Case chronology:
- 16 Sep 2013: patient developed fever and muscle stiffness/pain
- 18 Sep 2013: patient sought medical help in a private hospital in the Bekasi District, but [his fever increased, accompanied by coughing and dyspnea (shortness of breath) and he] was back and hospitalised in the same hospital on 20 Sep 2013
- 25 Sep 2013: patient's condition got worse, still with high fever and greater difficulty breathing, and was transferred to the intensive care unit
- 26 Sep 2013: at predawn the hospital's physician suspected that the patient had bird flu
- 27 Sep 2013: patient was transferred to Persahabatan referral hospital for avian influenza in Jakarta, but the patient passed away at 8.10 pm.

Epidemiological investigation had been conducted at the hospital, patient's home, and surrounding neighborhood by a joint team consisting of personnel from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Bekasi District, and West Java Province Health Services Offices, and Bekasi District and West Java Province Livestock Services Offices. The risk factor found was environmental contact based on the fact that patient owned ornamental birds and pigeons. Less than 50 meters [55 yards] in front of the patient's house a field was used once a week to stage pigeon races. Furthermore, a lot of birds, especially pigeons, kept by local residents, can be found in the surrounding neighbourhood.

With this additional case, cumulative cases of bird flu in Indonesia since 2005 up to date is 194 cases with 162 fatalities.

Prof Tjanda Yoga Aditama, MD, Director General of Disease Control and Environmental Health as the focal point for International Health Regulation had reported this latest case to the WHO.

This news was broadcasted by the Public Communication Center, Secretariat General, Ministry of Health, RI. Further information can be obtained by contacting phone: +6221-52907416 through 52907419, fax: +6221-52921669, Rapid Response Center (PTRC): <Indonesian local code> 500-567 and +6281281562620 (text message), or e-mail to <kontak@depkes.go.id>.

[ProMED-mail thanks correspondent C Baso Darmawan for providing this alternative translation of the Ministry of Health statement that was included as part of the previous ProMED-mail report.

This new translation includes some additional relevant information not included in the previous version. In particular the information that the deceased had extensive contact with pigeons and other birds not in his home and in adjacent ground. It is likely that exposure to avian H5N1 influenza virus was a consequence of these particular circumstances. - Mod.CP
