VIRUSES SURVIVE AIRCRAFT TOILET TREATMENT (03)

I would like to know why this study was performed, and what all the fuss is
about.
Why aircraft toilets specifically? Is it because of all the foreign viruses
that may be deposited into the US sewage system? What about all the viruses
that are routinely deposited into them daily anyway? What about the carriers
of the viruses, who walk off the aircraft and make direct deposits into the
sewers via the airport [hotels]?
Am I missing the point?

[What fuss? I am the Moderator today and no one is around to give me sage
advice, so I will simply rely on my many years of experience and guess. Here
is my answer: I have no idea. Could be someone had a small grant (and is now
flush). Could be someone was responding to an inquiry or complaint. Could
be some xenophobic lunatic wrote a letter to someone with pull ("our"
viruses and microorganisms are nonpathogenic but "theirs" threaten "us").
Could be we are all missing the point. I suggest that, rather than try to
figure out the purpose of this study we simply pull the chain on further
discussions. Please pardon the unintellectual approach -- Mod CHC]
