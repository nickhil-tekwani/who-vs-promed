Leishmaniasis in Eldorado, Misiones patient
-------------------------------------------
Responsible dog ownership and home care to prevent the spread of
_Lutzomyia longipalpis_, [sandflies not mosquitoes] that carry
leishmaniasis, are essential to halt the spread of the disease in
Misiones. Therefore, the Public Health authorities indicate that
these measures should be applied every day, not only to reduce the
risk of infection, but also to avoid the proliferation of the sandfly
vector.

Social responsibility is essential to prevent vector-borne diseases in
Misiones, such as visceral leishmaniasis, because if everyone, all
together, every day apply preventive measures, not only can we succeed
in reducing the risk of infection, but also avoid the proliferation of
the sandfly vector that transmits leishmaniasis.

In that vein, the Ministry of Public Health of Misiones, through the
Department of Epidemiological Surveillance reports that a 14 year old
native of Eldorado is being treated at a private clinic in Posadas.
The patient, who lives in the Independence neighborhood, has enlarged
organs (liver and spleen) and very marked signs of losing weight. The
diagnosis was made by bone marrow aspiration, the parasite found in
the observation. His health is delicate and the prognosis is guarded.

The disease
-----------
Visceral leishmaniasis affects the liver, spleen, lymph nodes and
other organs. Clinical signs are fever of long duration, anemia,
weight loss and progressive weakness.

Preventive Measures
-------------------
Epidemiological Surveillance, under the Secretary of Health, recalled
that one of the main recommendations is to maintain permanent clean
and vacant land, avoiding the accumulation of dead leaves, because
unlike the vector that transmits dengue and yellow fever, "the sandfly
deposits eggs in decaying organic substances and in that way it is
difficult to find the larvae."

In the case of pets, they must be protected with insect repellent to
avoid being bitten by the sandfly, and on the other hand, make sure
that dogs are not wandering in the street. "Dogs are the main
reservoir of visceral leishmaniasis, so we have to be responsible for
them as well." Therefore, the public are urged to exercise extreme
precautions in caring for the dogs to reduce the risk of disease
transmission.

The main preventive measures are:
Eliminate the presence of sandflies in the house (using insect
repellents, pills, insecticides, mosquito nets or screens placed in
openings).

Destroy all possible breeding of the larvae. Eradicate stubble and
weeds around homes, locate and dispose of empty containers or unusable
containers and spraying.

Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants for travel through areas with
sandflies.

Clean kennels or areas inhabited by dogs and prevent them from being
bitten by insects.

On the other hand, the health portfolio reminds people to attend the
Primary Care Center (CAPS) or the nearest hospital in the presence of
the following symptoms:
- Prolonged fever
- Listlessness
- Weight loss
- Organ enlargement

It also suggests that pet owners go to the vet and be wary of the
following signs: Hair loss, especially around the eyes and ears,
fatigue and inactivity; thinning, seborrhea, flaky hoof growth [not in
dogs Mod.SB].

See our comment in the ProMED posting 20090225.0787, 25 Feb 2009:
Leishmaniasis has been slowly spreading in northern Argentina over the
past decades (Salomon O et al. First visceral leishmaniasis focus in
Argentina. Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz. 2008;103:109-11
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18368242?ordinalpos=9&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum).

A recent study of the ecology of sandflies in Misiones has been
published:
Fernandez MS et al. Phlebotominae fauna in a recent deforested area
with American Tegumentary Leishmaniasis transmission (Puerto Iguaza,
Misiones, Argentina): Seasonal distribution in domestic and
peridomestic environments. Acta Trop. 2011 Nov 29. [Epub ahead of
print]. The paper points out that "In the northeastern border of the
country, an outbreak of ATL during 2004-2005 was associated with
deforestation and subsequent settlement of farmers close to the edge
of the forest." Furthermore, the study discusses the role of the
pigsty as an environment that attracts more sandflies.
