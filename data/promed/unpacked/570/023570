The deaths of monkeys increases the attention to yellow fever in Parana state
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The state Health Department on Wednesday [9 Dec 2020] confirmed the deaths of 8 monkeys from yellow fever virus infection. These cases occurred in Clevelandia (2 cases), Coronel Domingos Soares (3), Mangueirinha (1), and Cruz Machado (2).

Parana state in Brazil has registered to date since 1 Jul [2020] 81 notifications of monkeys dead of the virus. Of these, 11 cases are under investigation, 32 occurred for indeterminate causes, 30 were discarded [as yellow fever cases], and 8 were confirmed as yellow fever cases.

The veterinarian of the Division of Vector borne Diseases of the Secretariat, Emanuelle Gemin Pouzato, stated that monkeys are not [direct] transmitters of yellow fever [virus]. "Like humans, they are also infected by the virus and do not run the risk of transmitting the virus [directly] to people ."

Humans
------
Regarding human yellow fever cases this season, the area technician said that 10 cases have been reported as of this Wednesday [9 Dec 2020]. None of these were confirmed, 9 were discarded, and one case continues under investigation in the Curitiba municipality.

Vaccine
------
The effective way to prevent yellow fever is the vaccine. Since July 2018, all the municipalities of Parana have been designated areas with circulation of this viral disease and where vaccination is recommended.

The State Health Department orients all the municipalities to promote strategies for selective intensification of vaccination, with priority given to the affected cities and then regionally expanded.

As of now, the vaccine coverage in Parana is 71.28%, while the recommended goal is 95%. The calculated percentage takes into account only children less than one year of age who received the vaccine from January to October this year [2020].

[The number of monkeys reported dead has increased from 3 on 27 Nov 2020 to 8 currently. The dates on which the monkeys were found is not given so it is not possible to know if these deaths were sequential or occurred within the same time period. These 8 dead monkeys were found in 4 municipalities, indicating that the area where transmission of the virus was occurring was not confined to a single location.

Finding 8 monkeys dead of yellow fever (YF) is not surprising at this time of year. In Brazil, yellow fever has a seasonal pattern, based on historical analyses of human cases and epizootics due to yellow fever in the past 20 years, with 2 different periods: higher transmission occurring between December and May (seasonal period) and lower or interrupted transmission occurring between June and November. Since the December-May period is beginning, one wonders if a new period of transmission is underway. Efforts to reach 95% vaccination coverage in the state is prudent, given the evidence that active yellow fever virus transmission is occurring. - Mod.TY
