As a veterinary pathologist with a focus on avian patients I have quietly
read posts on disease outbreaks around the world. ProMED has been a daily
highlight for over 2 years. and I have the utmost of respect and
admiration for what you have continued to achieve.
You request for involvement in ProMED is well based but points out a sad
reality of the health care establishment. I have no doubt that if Tracey
McNamara had posted to you when she first knew that she had something
different, folks might have listened to her. But sadly, for some time, they
did not. Unfortunately, posting an undiagnosed encephalitis has far more
ramifications for animal populations (quarantine, diagnostic euthanasia,
etc) that for our human counterparts (in most cases).
Your post demonstrates 3 sad realities of veterinary diagnostics - 1)the
politics of veterinary medicine are extensive because of human health
considerations, 2)getting the ear of public health officials requires
non-traditional notification such as ProMED, and 3)because of financial
deficiencies, the luxury of computer time is often denied overworked
veterinary diagnosticians (probably not dissimilar to our human public
health counter parts!)
Rest assured that many zoo pathologists already routinely monitor ProMED
and many traditional veterinary diagnosticians do so as well. When the time
arises, if you can remind folks that just because we often are forced by
political restraints to have a hard and fast diagnosis before we alert
colleagues, does not mean that don't know what we are doing.
You might find clarification by Dr. McNamara at the Bronx Zoo regarding the
sequence of events about this matter very enlightening regarding the
integration of veterinary diagnostics in human and public health.
