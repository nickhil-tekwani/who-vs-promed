Dr. Beth MacConnell, a histopathologist, peers into a large tank in her
laboratory -- to see whether her trout will whirl. There are a few dozen
young rainbows inside.
A trout languishing weakly on the bottom begins to twirl, looking as if it
is chasing its tail. Up the tank it goes, possessed, whirling round and
round until its dizzy ascent takes it right to the top. Exhausted, it
floats listlessly back down to the bottom, near death.
"That," Dr. MacConnell says, "is how it got its name." This is whirling
disease, a parasitic scourge that is devastating trout populations
throughout the United States.
This disease, which seems harmless to humans, is moving so quickly, so
surely through U.S. waters that it could wipe out some wild trout
populations in western states.
Whirling disease is now found in at least 22 states, including such
pristine waters as Yellowstone Lake in the heart of Yellowstone National
Park, where biologists came across it last November while doing a routine
count of the native cutthroat trout.
In Montana, the parasite has spread rapidly, and is being blamed for
killing off 90 per cent of the Madison River's famous rainbows. (It attacks
the fry shortly after they hatch and, in most cases, leaves the young fish
so deformed they simply can't eat.)
And it's coming to Canada. Across the border in Alberta and British
Columbia, scientists are watching helplessly as the disease comes ever closer.
It has already reached some rivers that connect with the Canadian
watershed. As well, migratory birds that feed on diseased trout carcasses
are believed to be carrying the sturdy parasitic spores across the border
and depositing them in Canadian waters and soil.
The spectre of further damage from the parasite has caused such concern
that Alberta has set up a task force on the disease to see whether it can
keep the whirling death at bay. Two years ago, the task force resulted in a
ban on imports of live trout to Alberta."We're not even trying to prevent
it from coming," said Mr. Kerry Brewin, a biologist with Trout Unlimited in
Calgary, who sits on the task force's technical committee. "We're just
trying to slow
down its spread."
The parasite _Myxobolus cerebralis_ is a fiendish foe. The thing is almost
indestructible. The microscopic spores, about the size of a human red blood
cell, can freeze and thaw with perfect immunity, and are very difficult to
kill.
She had to immerse them in a solution of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water for
10 minutes before they died, she recalled. Five minutes didn't come close
to doing the trick.
Some of her colleagues wanted to test the creature's DNA and had to bake
the spores in a microwave oven for 10 minutes -- on high -- just to get the
shell to pop open.
Before appearing in the wild, the parasite contaminated US fish hatcheries.
To get rid of it, hatchery workers tried draining their ponds, destroying
the fish and treating the pond bottoms with lime. The spores lived.
In fact, they can act as death-filled time capsules, and lie dormant at the
bottom of a stream for up to 30 years.
And each hard spore produces triactinomyxons -- TAMs for short -- the
second phase of the parasite's life cycle. They burst forth from the hard
shell, ravenous for trout, complete with 3 swimming appendages sprouting
from a central stem.
Dr. MacConnell breeds the TAMs for her experiments. She feeds the
quasi-inert spores to little tubifex worms nestled in sand in a sweater
box. Twelve weeks later, the spores have ripened inside the worms and burst
forth with TAMs, which she collects. "Millions -- out of one sweater box,"
she said, shaking her head again.
Whirling disease is one of those strange ecological phenomena stemming from
an unwitting exchange of wildlife between continents.
The best guess is it came to Pennsylvania in some frozen table trout from
Denmark about 1955. In Europe, the parasite is relatively innocuous to the
native brown trout. There, the parasite has evolved over tens of thousands
of years and has figured out how to live companionably -- and not lethally
-- inside the trout.
Unleashed in North America, where the native trout were used to different
types of parasites, it was a pestilence.
Despite the wide swath of destruction the parasite cuts, it was barely
understood until recently. It was the 1980s before scientists realized the
spores and the TAMs are different phases of the same parasite and they need
the worm to get to the trout.
It turns out these worms, which eat the spores, have exactly the right body
temperature and chemical makeup to coax the thick-skinned spores to
transform into TAMs and pop open.
That breakthrough didn't provide any cures, but at least it allowed
scientists to catalogue how the trout get sick. But knowing how the
parasite works is not the same thing as understanding how to cure the
epidemic. U.S. federal and state governments and private foundations have
poured money into solving that mystery.
Scientists hold a whirling-disease symposium each year -- Canadians
included -- to exchange findings, sponsored by the Bozeman-based Whirling
Disease Foundation.
All that research, though, is framed within some hard truths. The spore is
impossible to eradicate. The tubifex is the world's most common worm.
Killing it would mean killing off everything the wild trout need to survive.
With those facts, you turn to the fish. Why, for instance, do some fish die
from the parasite and not others? Brown trout, long since introduced from
Europe to North America, are still largely unaffected.
Duane Radford, the assistant head of the Alberta government's fish and
wildlife division and one of the chairmen of the whirling-disease task
force, is among the few knowledgeable Canadians who points out the tubifex
worm is not as prevalent in Alberta as in Montana's streams. But he
acknowledges if the parasite reaches Canada's wild trout, it will be a
catastrophe.
Dr. Beth MacConnell and her colleagues have written the definitive paper
"Death March" on how whirling disease attacks trout. It was published last
year in the Immunological Review.
The attack: Once released from tubifex worms, the triactinomyxons (TAMs)
float in the river, waiting for vulnerable, newborn trout to appear. As the
fry hatch from their eggs on the bottom, the parasites shoot hooks,
attached to coiled filaments, into the trout and latch on, often around the
fins and mouth.
Up to 64 infective cells from the TAMs burrow between the cells of the
fish's skin. Within 2 hours, they've begun to multiply copiously. Then they
march through the skin and into nerve endings.
Day 4: The parasites have begun stealing into the central nervous system,
which they use essentially as a system of roads to reach their real
objective: the fry's tasty cartilage, especially the large deposits in the
spinal column and skull.
Day 20: By now, depending on water temperature, the parasites have reached
cartilage and have begun to devour it, destroying the fish's structural
framework. The eyes start to bug out. The skull becomes misshapen. The
spine looks like a roller coaster.
Day 45: As its brain stem and neural system collapse, the trout's tail
turns black and the fish begins to whirl. Day 90: The hard-shelled spores
have begun to form inside the trout's cartilage, encased in bone.
Death: The trout are often tough enough to withstand the attack itself.
However, they eventually starve to death, or are eaten themselves because
they can't swim well enough to escape.
Postmortem: A fish that lives for 5 months may carry as many as two million
spores. They are released after it dies and begins to decay.
