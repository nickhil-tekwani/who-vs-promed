Wipe it out: Number of new hepatitis cases on the rise
------------------------------------------------------
The Hepatitis Prevention and Control Programme has achieved significant milestones and there are a number of solid statistics to back it up. But according to Dr Ayaz Ali Memon, the manager of the programme, a lot has yet to be done.

In recent times, the programme has stepped up its game to keep a check on the disease. A total of 1446 screening camps were established last year alone. Just under one million people have been screened for the disease in Sindh. About 6.7 million people living in the province have also been inoculated against the disease.

Over the past 3 years, new molecular labs have been established at Civil Hospital, Mirpurkhas, Chandka Medical College, Larkana, and Ghulam Mohammad Mahar Medical College, Sukkur. While talking to The Express Tribune, Dr Memon said, "These labs cover the most populated areas of the province. Screening will help prevent the spread of the disease.* Dr Memon added that despite all of this, greater effort is required to prevent new cases. The programme he is working for is slated to end in 2014, but the incidence of hepatitis B and C is steadily rising across Pakistan. Though there is no exact figure of the number of people infected, rough estimates place the number of people in Sindh [province] with hepatitis B at one million and hepatitis C at 2 million. The number of infections is on the rise across all age groups. Globally, around 600 000 people die every year because of hepatitis B, while hepatitis C claims around 350 000 lives.

Dr Memon said that there is a need to improve the availability and storage of vaccines across the province. A lack of cold storage can make it difficult to store vaccines and subsequently drives to inoculate people. He added that 5 cold storage chains have been established in the province -- 2 in Hyderabad and one each in Larkana and Khairpur.

Major risk factors include sharing of needles or blades, transfusion of unscreened blood and unsafe sexual practices. The disease can also be transferred from an infected mother to her newborn.

Hepatitis A is usually seen in children and hepatitis E in adolescents. Both spread through contaminated food and water. Hepatitis A and E viruses are self-limiting and settle within a few days to a few weeks. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

[Hepatitis is predominately associated with viral infection. Hepatitis A is a viral liver disease that can cause mild to severe illness. Hepatitis A virus is transmitted through ingestion of contaminated food and water, or through direct contact with an infectious person. Hepatitis A is a vaccine-preventable disease.

Hepatitis B is a viral infection that attacks the liver and can cause both acute and chronic disease. The virus is transmitted through contact with the blood or other body fluids of an infected person. Hepatitis B is an important occupational hazard for health workers. Hepatitis B is preventable with the currently available safe and effective vaccine. Hepatitis D virus is only present in people already infected with hepatitis B

Hepatitis C is caused by hepatitis C virus and range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong condition that can lead to cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer. Hepatitis C virus is transmitted through contact with the blood of an infected person. There is no protective vaccine, but hepatitis C virus infection is becoming controllable with with antiviral drugs.

Hepatitis E virus infection is usually self-limiting but may develop into fulminant hepatitis. Hepatitis E virus is transmitted via the faecal-oral route, principally via contaminated water. Hepatitis E is found worldwide, but the prevalence is highest in East and South Asia.

The above account reviewing progress towards control of hepatitis virus infection in the Sindh province of Pakistan is more reassuring than many recent accounts in ProMED-mail cataloguing failures in the control of measles and poliomyelitis.
