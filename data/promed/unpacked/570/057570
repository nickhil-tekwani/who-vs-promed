The racehorse in training had been in 2 different stables and 2
veterinarians' clinics before the sickening diagnosis was handed down:
rabies. The female horse died 2 hours after she arrived at Dr Dan McBride's
Burnet Veterinary Clinic last week and was the case that prompted a
state-issued rabies alert for Burnet County.
After confirming 4 cases in 2005 and 14 last year [2006], the Hill Country
county that adjoins Travis on the north west already has 11 confirmed cases
in 2007, most of them in skunks. "We're way ahead of schedule," said
McBride, who serves as the county's animal health officer. There's a high
varmint population right now. They run in cycles, and we're at an all-time
high."
McBride and Burnet County Health Authority Dr Juliette Madrigal are
cautioning not only county residents, but also all Central Texas residents
to vaccinate their pets and some domestic livestock against rabies and to
be careful about approaching wild or feral animals. "If people are exposed,
we can vaccinate," Madrigal said. "But it's extremely expensive, and we
have to know there's been exposure to rabies. One man died (about 5 years
ago) from a raccoon strain of rabies, and nobody knew he'd ever been exposed."
Once animals or humans begin exhibiting symptoms of the disease -- which
usually has a 10 to 14 day exposure period, but can be much longer --
nothing that can be done. "It is 100 per cent fatal after it develops,"
Madrigal said, though there is one documented case of a 15 year old
Wisconsin girl who was bitten by a bat in 2004, spent 11 weeks in the
hospital and still survived even though she hadn't had a vaccination.
Since 1990, 39 fatal cases of rabies in humans have been confirmed, McBride
said, citing statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO). Another
39 000 people were treated for rabies exposure. "Any animals outside should
be vaccinated," McBride said. "I recommend that people vaccinate horses,
too. The horse that died last week was in a stable and still was exposed
(to a skunk). Any animals that people are around need to be vaccinated."
McBride said he saw the horse stumbling and slobbering in a trailer and
quickly tried to keep his employees and the horse's owners away from the
animal. It was too late for one employee, however, who had to be vaccinated
against the disease, at a cost of USD 1900.
McBride said most animals in a pasture will naturally shy away from wild
animals that are acting strangely, but he has a particular concern about
those raised by youths for [collegiate] 4-H and FFA [Future Farmers of
America, agricultural education] shows. "Show goats are one animal that
should be vaccinated," he said. "They are usually in small enclosures, and
the kids are around them every day; and most of those kids who go down to
the barn have a dog that goes with them. Everything should be protected.
It's a lot cheaper than having to get the rabies vaccine after you're exposed."
Rabies is an ancient disease that has evolved in different strains specific
to certain animals. Bats, raccoons, and skunks, for instance, all have
their own specific strain of rabies.
In Harris County, 26 rabies cases have been reported this year [2007], all
of them in bats. Nearby Wharton County has 30 confirmed cases, 28 of them
in skunks. Travis County has seen 105 cases the past 2 years [2006, 2007],
97 of them in bats. In rural areas of Central Texas, skunks, coyotes, and
foxes are common rabies hosts and carriers, McBride said.
A more recent rabies problem has developed in feral cats, which have proved
impossible to vaccinate. "That's another hot spot," McBride said. "We can't
get them vaccinated, and we know it." He warns people not to try to capture
and vaccinate wild cats. "Somebody tries to hold that cat, they get
scratched or bitten, and the animal gets away, and they still have to take
the (anti-rabies) shots," McBride said.
Dealing with rabies
-------------------
- vaccinate household pets every year.
- avoid contact with animals that are acting strangely or aggressively. 'If
you see a skunk or a coon or a bat in the daytime right now, it probably
has rabies,' said Dr Juliette Madrigal of the Burnet County Health Authority.
- do not shoot the sick animal or burn or bury a dead animal suspected of
having rabies. Call an animal control officer to have it picked up and tested.
- warn children about approaching sick or strange animals. Ask them to
report any contact they or their friends may have had with an infected animal.
- seek treatment immediately. Once signs of the disease appear in humans,
there is no treatment, and it is virtually always fatal.
Rabies cases in central Texas
-----------------------------
Though rabies cases in other area counties are on pace with last year
[2006], Burnet County has nearly equaled its 2006 total in just 4 months.
Skunks have accounted for 9 of the 11 cases this yea [2007] there.
Meanwhile, bats make up the majority of rabies cases in Travis and
Williamson counties, accounting for 129 of the 149 rabies reports in those
counties the past 2 years.

[The article refers to one rabies case who survived, after showing clinical
signs [see Rabies, human, bat - USA (WI) (07): recovery 20041231.3459]. Use
of the same protocol in other individuals has not yet met with the same
success.
The veterinarian is correct in saying all animals should be vaccinated,
including horses, goats, sheep, dogs, cats, and yes, cattle as well.
Especially vaccinate the cattle that you or your children may be showing.
Vaccination is cheap insurance compared to the consequences of the disease
or the cost of post exposure prophylaxis.
