In a follow-up on a report earlier this month [July 2022] of a human rabies case in the Federal District, the 1st such case in more than 40 years, officials now report the death of the teen. The male teenager, who was hospitalized since 20 Jun 2022, died Saturday [30 Jul 2022]. The teen contracted the lethal virus in late May [2022] after being scratched by a cat.

The last case of human rabies in the Federal District was recorded in 1978.

"All the necessary measures of epidemiological investigation, control and prophylaxis were taken with family members, close contacts and health professionals," informed the Health Department of the Federal District.

Brazil has been effective in controlling rabies, and occurrences have been sporadic. According to the historical series available on the Ministry of Health website, 45 cases have been recorded across the country since 2010.

In a survey by the Ministry of Health, of the other 44 cases registered in the country since 2010, 9 were infected through a dog, 22 from bats, 4 from non-human primates, 2 from foxes and 4 from felines. In 3 cases, it was not possible to identify the aggressor animal.

[2] Brazil (Minas Gerais): cattle

The number of positive cases of rabies in cattle in Muzambinho (in Minas Gerais) rose to 6. The results of yet another contaminated animal was confirmed this Thursday [4 Aug 2022] by the Instituto Mineiro de Agropecuária (IMA).

According to Luzia Adão e Silva, the animal technical advisor of the regional coordination of IMA de Poços de Caldas, the animal belonged to the producer of the 1st outbreak of bovine rabies in the municipality.

The Department of Agriculture of the Municipality of Muzambinho together with the Health Surveillance confirmed on 23 Jul 2022 that 3 heads of cattle that had died in recent weeks tested positive for rabies. Last week, 2 new cases were confirmed. Also according to the prefecture, there were other suspicions reported by producers who reported some of their animals died with signs of the disease.

The city government informed that IMA is monitoring the cases and is already promoting agricultural defense actions, including a project to control vampire bats. IMA classified the situation in the city as an outbreak. The agency informed a sweep in the city would be done in search of capturing vampire bats, considered the main transmitters of the disease.

The authorities emphasize producers must vaccinate all cattle, horses, goats and sheep against rabies, with a booster after 30 days of the 1st dose and revaccinate annually. Dogs and cats over 3 months of age should also be vaccinated against rabies, which is a zoonosis transmitted between animals and humans and causes death in virtually all those infected.

The prefecture also says producers who observe neurological signs in their animals should isolate them, not have contact with saliva and seek a veterinary doctor immediately. When dealing with bats, the guideline is not to try to capture the animal and call the Health Surveillance to do so.

[3] Bolivia (Pando): human, bat bite susp

https://www.la-razon.com/sociedad/2022/08/16/primer-caso-de-rabia-humana-en-pando-se-encuentra-en-coma-profundo/


In Pando, the 1st case of human rabies in a 53-year-old man was confirmed by the epidemiologist at the Roberto Galindo Hospital, Rick Ricardo Roca, who announced the patient has little chance of recovery and is in a deep coma.

He also informed the media the patient is an indigenous person from Barrio Puerto Alto, so they presume he was infected through the bite of a bat and intervened immediately. Likewise, as a precaution, intensive care unit and emergency unit personnel were vaccinated with an anti-rabies vaccine after contact with the infected person.

"This man arrived convulsing, with a condition that does not have the characteristics of other diseases and was assessed by specialists; due to the clinical picture and other testing, the result has been sent to the National Institute of Health Laboratories (Inlasa) of La Paz and the result came back positive," said the director of the Roberto Galindo hospital, Nahum Vásquez. He added after the complete physical examination was carried out, they did not find dog bites and, therefore, they presume it was a bite from another species, such as bats or rodents.

From the Departmental Health Service (Headquarters) of Pando, they do not rule out declaring a health alert at the regional level. Human rabies is transmitted through the bite of animals, such as dogs or bats, but doctors declare this case as "atypical" because the source of transmission in the patient has not yet been identified. [Bites of bats may not be felt by sleeping or intoxicated individuals. Bats are known to have rabies, and this would likely fit the location and the scenario. - Mod.TG]

The Department of Health is warning of potential case of rabies in Kugluktuk after a dog died showing "possible signs" of the disease, according to a news release. Anyone who is bitten or scratched by a dog or a fox should go to the local health centre, seek treatment and report the incident immediately, as rabies infections are almost always fatal, states the release.

It also says people who tie up their dogs outside should monitor their animals for behaviours which could indicate possible rabies signs. That includes staggering, frothing at the mouth, choking or making strange noises.

Anybody who sees a fox or wolf wandering around the community can contact Kugluktuk's conservation officer. Anybody whose dog has had contact with a fox or wolf can contact the regional environmental health officer.

Three people were exposed to a rabid fox found in Lexington County, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) said Tuesday [2 Aug 2022]. The fox was sent to DHEC's lab for testing on 23 Jul 2022 and was confirmed to have rabies a day later, officials said in a news release.

The animal was discovered in Lexington, in the area near Peach Tree Rock Road between Jules Road and Peachtree Rock Heritage Preserve, according to the release. The people have been told to seek medical care, health officials said. Further information on their conditions was not made available.

"If you, someone you know, or your pets have come into contact with this fox or another animal potentially having rabies, please call DHEC's Environmental Affairs, Columbia office...," health officials said in the release.

Additionally, if you think you've been exposed to a rabid animal, immediately wash the affected area with plenty of soap and water, officials said. Health officials said an exposure is direct contact -- possibly through broken skin or mucous membranes in the eyes, nose, or mouth -- from a bite, scratch, or contact with saliva, body fluids, or brain/nervous system tissue from an infected or possibly infected animal.

This update includes one human death and a possible pending human death. Rabies reaches almost every aspect of the world. Bats can be major contributors to this situation. While bats are important pollinators, they may also be both victim and perpetrator of spreading the virus to other animals, and to humans.

If you find yourself with a bat indoors, please report it and seek immediate medical attention. This is the time to get post-exposure prophylaxis, a measure that can save your life. Even if you do not know whether you have been bitten or scratched by a bat, but find one in your living space, seek medical assistance immediately.

Wild animals may also have rabies and interact with our pets and/or ourselves in unfortunate ways. Never take a bite to your pet or yourself lightly, especially from a wild animal. Seek medical attention for yourself and your pet immediately. One of the most important things you can do is to keep your pet current on rabies prevention vaccinations. This can save your pet's life.

This report also includes information regarding cattle with rabies. It is possible in South America it was caused by a vampire bat. The bats tend to like feeding on cattle at night. But it highlights the necessity, regardless of your location, of prevention vaccines for your livestock. Rabies is no respecter of animal size or breed, or even a person. The bats are after a blood meal and any source will do. You can and should vaccinate your livestock against rabies.

While this report does not include horses or other livestock, they are susceptible to the virus. These large animals can be devastating to us if they are rabid. A vaccine can protect your animal investment as well as your own life.

If you are bitten, wash the wound, and seek medical attention immediately. Post-exposure prophylaxis is a series of injections given in the muscle of the arm. However, time between being bitten and seeking treatment is a narrow window, so please seek medical assistance quickly. - Mod.TG]
