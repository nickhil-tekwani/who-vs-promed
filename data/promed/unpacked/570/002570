Cholera situation under control: Municipal Commissioner
*********************
NEW DELHI, July 15.
The Municipal Commissioner, Mr. V. K. Duggal, said today that cholera was
endemic to Delhi and could not be eradicated totally. Making a statement
before the Standing Committee of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD),
he said several cases of cholera were being reported in the city daily,
this was no cause for alarm as the situation was "fully under control".
Mr. Duggal said about eight cases of cholera were being reported daily,
which included patients from the neighbouring states. Of a total of 681
cases, 98 are from outside. "Though the number is about a couple of
patients more than last year, it is much less than those reported during
the same time in 1995 and 1996 and no cholera deaths have been reported so
far. Between May and July in 1994, there were 853 cases of cholera, 702 in
1995, 365 in 1996 and 314 in 1997," he said. As far as gastroenteritis is
concerned, there were 28,577 cases reported between May and July 14 this
year as against 30,533 in 1994, 32,629 in 1995, 27,262 in 1996 and 29,124
in 1997. There has been only one gastroenteritis death this year as against
seven last year, four in 1996, 17 in 1995 and five in 1994.
"However, the figures were taken from 16 hospitals until last year but this
time, all 22 hospitals reported the cases to the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi, which has probably increased the number," he pointed out. Mr. Duggal
said several steps had been taken, to prevent the spread of diseases by the
Health Department of the MCD as per an Action Plan being implemented from
January this year.
Mr. Duggal said the Delhi Jal Board had been asked to ensure clean drinking
water supply to colonies which did not get the regular supply through
pipes. The Jal Board has been directed to clean and chlorinate the tankers
regularly and chlorine tablets were being distributed free. "People are
being educated by distribution of handbills and posters and even
audio-systems."
As far as action against those selling food under unhygienic conditions was
concerned, Mr. Duggal said 1.72 lakh kg of perishable food, 2.97 lakh kg of
ice and 956 sugarcane crushers were destroyed until July. Prosecution had
been carried out against 3,782 water trollies selling contaminated water.
Apparently, not too satisfied with the statement, the chairman, Mr. Shanti
Desai observed that the performance should not be judged on the basis of
figures. "If unhygienic food, sugarcane juice and ice are being sold, it
means that the fault is with the officers of the Corporation," he said.
Earlier, Mr. K. S. Gujral, (Congress I) alleged that not a single chlorine
tablet had been supplied to the Jhuggi clusters in the Central Zone. Mr.
Mahendra Nagpal (Bharatiya Janata Party) felt that the system of
distribution of chlorine tablets was faulty.
Dr. Narendra Nath, Leader of the Opposition, accused the Commissioner of
misleading the House about the number of cholera and gastroenteritis cases.
He accused the MCD of inefficiency and said that the diseases were
spreading because of choking drains, overflowing pits and sale of
unhygienic food and a faulty system of distribution of chlorine tablets.
