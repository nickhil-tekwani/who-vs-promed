Abstract
--------
_Aedes notoscriptus_ (Skuse), the Australian backyard mosquito, is a pestiferous daytime-biting species native to Australia and the surrounding southwestern Pacific region. It is suspected to play a role in the transmission of several arboviruses and is considered a competent vector of dog heartworm, _Dirofilaria immitis_ (Leidy). This highly adaptable mosquito thrives in natural and artificial water-holding containers in both forested and urbanized areas, from tropical to temperate climates, and has benefitted from a close association with humans, increasing in abundance within its native range. It invaded and successfully established in New Zealand as well as in previously unoccupied temperate and arid regions of Australia. _Ae. notoscriptus_ was discovered in Los Angeles County, California, in 2014, marking the 1st time this species had been found outside the southwestern Pacific region. By the end of 2019, immature and adult mosquitoes had been collected from 364 unique locations within 44 cities spanning 3 southern California counties. The discovery, establishment, and rapid spread of this species in urban areas may signal the global movement and advent of a new invasive container-inhabiting species. The biting nuisance, public health, and veterinary health implications associated with the invasion of southern California by this mosquito are discussed.

[Although the information about the 1st detection of _Aedes notoscriptus_ in southern California is not particularly new, having occurred 7 years ago with follow up surveillance until 2019, the establishment of an invasive mosquito in a new country, the USA, is noteworthy. In addition to being a nuisance biter, this mosquito is of potential animal and human health importance since it is a vector of canine heartworm and potentially of arboviruses. Given that it breeds in a variety of types of water containers, control of this mosquito will be difficult and it is likely to spread beyond the 3 California counties where it has been reported. This mosquito now joins invasive _Ae. aegypti_ and _Ae. albopictus_, important virus vectors, in coming to southern California. - Mod.TY
