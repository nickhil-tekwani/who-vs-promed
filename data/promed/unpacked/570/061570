Algeria has placed a temporary halt on the trade in livestock for breeding
to arrest an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, officials said on
Saturday. The trading ban was temporary pending a mass vaccination of the
country's livestock, they added.
The disease was first discovered at a farm in the Bir Touta area outside
Algiers seven days ago. Other cases have been reported in the east and
central regions. ``In total, 130 cows and sheep have so far been affected
and killed,'' one official said.
Samples from affected animals had been sent to a laboratory in Britain
where the illness was diagnosed as foot-and-mouth disease type O, the
officials said.
Algeria experienced a similar outbreak seven years ago. The country has
about 18 million sheep and more than 1.5 million cattle.
