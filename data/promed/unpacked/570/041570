It is official now: the stock of 4.5 lakh [a lakh equals 100 000]
vaccines for Japanese encephalitis (JE), which had already suffered a
loss of potency was due to the fault in maintaining the cold chain at
the Government Medical Store Depot (GMSD) in Karnal. This comes after
a team from the Union Health Ministry had conducted an inspection of
the cold storage at the GMSD.

The team found that the stocks sent 2 months ago to states like Uttar
Pradesh (UP), Tamil Nadu and West Bengal was in Stage I, which
indicated that the fault occurred only after the stocks were dispatched.

Following these initial reports, experts from the ministry will once
again reinspect the Karnal unit to find out further details so that
action could be taken against the errant officials of GMSD. "It is
now clear that the fault existed at the Karnal unit itself and it
occurred in the past 2 months. But in order to find out how and when
this fault did occur, a team of experts will soon visit the unit,"
said a senior official of the Health Ministry.

Following the controversy over the vaccine in the state, the Centre
has decided to withdraw the supply and replace it with the fresh
stock. The previous stock will be used for the JE vaccination
campaign rather than the routine immunisation programme.

"We will not use this supply in any case for the children in the
state. The vaccine sent by the Centre was to be used under the
routine immunisation in the most sensitive areas for JE. Thus, any
reduction in the potency could be lethal for the children," said Dr.
M L Khatloiya, the Director General, Medical and Health Uttar Pradesh.

The Centre, however, is yet to decide as to which state will
eventually receive the present supply of the vaccine, which is lying with UP.

"It is true that the JE vaccine lying with the UP Government has lost
some of its potency. But our experts, who had visited the state, have
found that it can still be used within the next 2 months," said a
senior official, Infectious Disease wing, Union Health Ministry.

"It is for sure that we cannot use the present stocks for the routine
immunisation programme. But it can be used for the JE vaccination
programme," added the official.

It was learnt that Bihar, which is going to start the JE vaccination
campaign from December [2008], is one of the probable states that
could receive this stock.

[As discussed in prior ProMED-mail postings, the "cold chain" refers
to the steps necessary to ensure that vaccines used in immunization
activities are kept within their require temperature range from
manufacture through to actual administration of the vaccine. Most of
the vaccines used in vaccination programs are heat labile, so
prolonged exposure to temperatures above a specified cutoff level
will result in a reduction in potency. In vaccines that are composed
of live attenuated viruses the vaccine viruses are killed/inactivated
if exposed to higher temperatures during their transport and storage.
Most of the vaccine used in vaccination programs internationally now
come in vials with built in temperature monitors that change colors
when a maximum temperature has been surpassed for a specified time
limit, predetermined to be associated with significant loss of
potency of the vaccine in the vial.

If one understands the ongoing situation in Uttar Pradesh, there has
been a major outbreak of Japanese encephalitis this year, with a
large proportion of cases with a history of adequate vaccination, and
probably data that demonstrated a much lower than expected vaccine
efficacy in the state. (To calculate the vaccine efficacy, one needs
information on the attack rate among the vaccinated population (ARv)
and the attack rate in the unvaccinated population (ARuv)). Further
investigations in the state revealed that many of the vaccine vial
temperature monitors had changed color, confirming that the vaccines
had been exposed to high temperatures for a period of time known to
be associated with significant potency loss. This moderator found a
newswire posted 14 Sep 2008 with a discussion of the findings:

"The stock of nearly 4.5 lakh vaccines for Japanese Encephalitis
(JE), which was found unfit for use after arrival in the city on
Friday [12 Sep 2008], had already suffered a loss of potency before
being dispatched from the Government Medical Store Depot (GMSD) at
Karnal. Experts from an international NGO PATH, who visited GMSD on
Saturday [13 Sep 2008], found that Vaccine Vial Monitor on a large
number of vials stored there had undergone change of colour,
indicating Stage II exposure due to heat and loss of efficacy....
[the] Chief Medical Officer in-charge of GMSD, said: "When we
inspected the stock today, some of the vial monitors had reached
Stage II. It should not be much of a problem as vials with exposure
of Stage II can be used for vaccination."

"When the stock had arrived in Lucknow last evening [12 Sep 2008],
officials found that many samples showed Stage III and IV exposure.
...UP officials insist that nothing was wrong at their end.....[the]
Director General (family welfare) of the state government, said, "We
checked the supply as soon as it reached us and informed the senior
ministry officials in the ministry that a large number of samples had
reached Stages III and IV." Sources, however, said the vaccine stock
remained at the Lucknow airport for over 5 hours and this could have
damaged it."

If the entire shipment is being deemed unworthy of use in Uttar
Pradesh as is suggested in the above newswire, it is hard to
understand why it will be okay to use in another state. One suspects
that there may be a lack of understanding on the part of the media
here and that the actual plan is to remove all the vials presently
distributed in the state and let the central vaccine storage bank
discard those vials with temperature indicators demonstrating
probable potency loss, and then redistribute the "good vials" in a
future vaccine distribution shipment. Clarification of the rationale
here would be greatly appreciated -- but what is the definition of
good vials -- stage II color indicator change.... - Mod.MPP

This report provides confirmation that a current lot of JE virus
vaccine has been rejected, and explains the reasons for it (see
ProMED archive 20080918.2924). It is not clear why the vaccine lot
that was rejected for the immunization campaign in children because
of loss of potency is still considered suitable for the vaccination campaign.
