[This is an increase of 9 cases & 2 deaths since our previous report of 24
Jan 2003 posted on 27 Jan 2003 -- see ref. (03) below. There is a growing
risk of urbanization of the epidemic, but the authorities are taking
aggressive measures to contain it by mass vaccination. Travelers to all
affected & at risk areas in Brazil & elsewhere should be vaccinated. -
