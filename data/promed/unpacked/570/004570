Scientists of Plant Research International of Wageningen UR
[University and Research Centre] have identified the virus that
causes great damage in tomato cultivation in Mexico. The disease is
known as Marchitez, which means withered. The name of the new virus
is Tomato marchitez virus [ToMarV]. The virus causes leaf necrosis
and serious damage to the fruits, resulting in a strong yield
reduction. Whitefly is one of the vectors of the virus.
Identification of the virus now makes it possible to develop
resistant cultivars.

Tomato marchitez virus is found to be closely related to Tomato
torrado virus [ToTV], earlier discovered in Spain, which causes the
damaging Torrado disease in tomato. The viruses were both fully
characterised and described as new species. Both viruses are now
classified into the new [proposed] plant virus genus Torradovirus.

It is remarkable that in a short period of time, 2 new viruses have
been found and described that can, on the basis of their unique
characteristics, be ascribed to a new plant virus genus.

[Additional information from the source: the new virus was isolated
from a tomato plant from the state of Sinaloa in Mexico. This plant
showed symptoms locally known as marchitez disease, including severe
leaf necrosis beginning at the base of the leaflets and necrotic
rings on the fruits.

A virus was isolated from the infected plant consisting of isometric
particles with a diameter of approximately 28 nanometers. The viral
genome consisted of 2 (+)ssRNA molecules of 7221 (RNA1) and 4898
nucleotides (RNA2). The viral capsid contained 3 coat proteins of 35,
26 and 24 kDa, respectively. The characteristics of symptoms,
morphology, coat proteins, and RNAs were similar to those of the
previously described Tomato torrado virus (ToTV). Sequence analysis
of the entire viral genome showed that this new virus is related to,
but distinct from, ToTV. For this new virus, the name Tomato
marchitez virus (ToMarV) is proposed.

ToTV causes leaf necrosis resulting in considerable yield loss. The
virus appears to be spreading, and whiteflies (_T. vaporariorum_)
were shown to be vectors. Phylogenetic analyses showed that ToTV is
related to, but distinct from, viruses belonging to the genera
_Sequivirus_, _Sadwavirus_, and _Cheravirus_ in the proposed order of
the Picornavirales. ToMarV and ToTV both share unique features that
clearly distinguish them from other plant picorna-like viruses. These
2 viruses are likely to belong to the same new genus for which the
name Torradovirus was recently proposed by the ICTV (International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) study group on plant picorna-like
viruses. Another new virus, Tomato apex necrosis virus (ToANV), may
also be related.
