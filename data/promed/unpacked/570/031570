An outbreak of a very virulent form of hepatitis E has caused the deaths of
67 people in northern Uganda since the end of 2007, and 4000 other people
have been reported sick, according to a government officer.

The minister of health, Dr Emmanuel Otala, said that the disease affected
Kitgum, Pader, and Gulu districts, where the majority of people live in
overcrowded refugee camps after 2 decades of civil war. "We have 4127
persons hospitalized with hepatitis E, and we have recorded 67 deaths since
the disease attacked this region at the end of 2007," declared Dr Otala.
"More than 80 per cent of those that died were pregnant women and children,
who have very low immunity levels," added Dr Otala.

Hepatitis E resembles hepatitis A, and it is usually transmitted through
contaminated food [and water]. Northern Uganda lacks potable water supplies.

[The hepatitis E outbreak in the Kitgum region of northern Uganda, which
began in October 2007, has not yet been contained. Since the last report on
20 Jun 2008, the number of cases has risen from 3082 to 4127, and the
number of deaths from 64 to 67. It is likely that control of the outbreak
will not be achieved until there is provision of improved sanitation and
adequate supplies of clean water.
