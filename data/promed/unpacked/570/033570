Of the 162 farms that were tested during the recent weeks for the presence of bovine tuberculosis [bTB], 19 have been given the status of "suspect." These are partial results. The inspection was required last month [July 2015], after the disease had surfaced in a dairy farm in Meeuwen, in the province Limburg.

The diagnosis of bovine tuberculosis, a disease that can be transmitted from animals to humans, was established last month [July 2015] In a dairy farm in Meeuwen. All 180 cattle on the farm have been culled. In addition, 162 farms have been put under animal movement restrictions because they had bought, during the past few years, cattle from the affected farm in Meewen or sold cattle to the said farm. This means they are temporarily not allowed to trade in animals. They were required to be tested within 30 days; the 1st results have now become available.

In 42 of the 162 farms, bovine tuberculosis has not been found, leading to the lifting of restrictions. On 19 farms, the status has been changed from "suspended" (blocked) to "suspected." This means that the 1st tests have given a positive or equivocal result. The animals of these farms must now undergo a second test. The possibility therefore exists that the tuberculosis infection is present beyond the farm in Meeuwen. Of the remaining 101 farms, the results are not yet available. They continue to be "suspended" until further notice.

Belgium is officially free of bTB since 2003 (less than 1 in 1000 holdings affected by the disease). However, every year several infected farms are reported, similarly to the situation in many other officially tuberculosis-free countries, says the Cabinet's Minister of Agriculture, Willy Borsus (MR) [Reformist Movement (French: Mouvement Reformateur, MR), a liberal and conservative-liberal French-speaking political party in Belgium].

Although the disease is transmissible from animals to humans, the risk of infection is small. The responsible bacterium, _Mycobacterium bovis_, can be transmitted by close contact with the animals. In practice this means that the farmer and his family, the veterinarian, the cattle dealers and slaughterhouse workers are most at risk. A consumer can become infected just by drinking raw milk or eating cheese made from raw milk. Most milk is pasteurized (heated) in [Belgium], a process that the bacteria will not survive. The meat in the store is then closely monitored, according to the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain (AFSCA).

"I want to reassure citizens. Thanks to the strict controls that are applied, they can consume safely beef and dairy products, "says Borsus.

[Belgium has been officially free from bovine tuberculosis for 10 years, though sporadic cases still occur.

The requirements for a country to qualify as free from bTB are stipulated in OIE's terrestrial Code, article 11.6.2., available at http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_bovine_tuberculosis_farmed_cervidae.htm. As long as the country maintains its bTB-freedom in at least 99.8 per cent of the herds and 99.9 per cent of the cattle, its national bTB-free status recognition is maintained.

Final results of the tests within the remaining 101 contact farms, and information on the initial source of infection, are anticipated. - Mod.AS
