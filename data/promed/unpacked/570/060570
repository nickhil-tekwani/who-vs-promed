International readers may not be aware that an epidemic of _Streptococcus
suis_ infection among humans has occurred previously in China, and in fact
originated in Jiangsu province too.
In the summer of 1998 (Jul and Aug), an epidemic of deadly _S. suis_
infection struck people in Jiangsu, resulting in 14 deaths and more than 80
000 dead pigs. The epidemiological investigation and clinical description
(including diagnosis, microbiological confirmation and treatment) of the
epidemic were well-reported in Chinese medical journals. The epidemiologic
link of the victims to dead or diseased pigs is similar to that in the
recent outbreak in Sichuan, and cases were sporadic in occurrence and
scattered in geographic distribution. No point-source outbreak or
human-to-human transmission was documented.
In one of the reports, 25 persons were affected and 14 died (overall
mortality rate 56 percent). 13 out of 16 persons who developed
streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) died (crude mortality rate 81
percent). Of the 9 persons who developed streptococcal meningitis, only 1
died (crude mortality rate 11 percent). The clinical picture is similar to
that reported recently in Sichuan, except that the Sichuan cases are now
classified into 4 categories, (1) ordinary type (milder febrile illness
with no shock or meningitis), (2) STSS (with high mortality), (3)
meningitis (with high incidence of sensorineural deafness), and (4) mixed
type (with both STSS and meningitis, and with high mortality). The culprit
was confirmed to be _S. suis_ serotype 2, the same as that which caused the
recent Sichuan outbreak. The epidemiologic links are the same as those
identified in Sichuan.
Thus, the disease occurring in epidemic proportion is not new in China, but
may be new in the English or world medical literature.
One thing that is not clear up to this moment is the extent of swine deaths
in Sichuan. In an official news report dated 5 Aug 2005
(<http://www.xinhuanet.com>) of the Xinhua News Agency), only 644 pigs were
reported to have been killed by the deadly bacterium in Sichuan as of 4 Aug
2005.

English abstracts) on the Jiangsu outbreak:
