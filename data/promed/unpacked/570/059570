Following the recent news that a local _E. coli_ [O157] outbreak came from a dessert item made by restaurant Reno Provisions, owner Mark Estee released a personal statement on [Wed 25 Nov 2015]. Estee said that he and his employees were "deeply saddened" when they heard that the outbreak was connected to their chocolate mousse, citing that "our 1st and foremost concern is always the safety of our guests." He said that they will assist the affected families as they recover.

Estee also expressed his gratitude for the professionalism of The Twisted Fork restaurant, which had originally been linked to the outbreak after they sold the chocolate mousse to their customers. He said that he also respects how quickly the Washoe County Health District [WCHD] was able to investigate the source of the illness.

According to the statement, the _E. coli_ made its way into the kitchen through the cross-contamination of meat and dessert processing equipment. "Our food production records allowed us to quickly identify that the wrong mixer was used to blend meat, transferring contaminants to the dessert," Estee said. "This was an isolated incident that violated our preparation protocols."

Under the guidance of a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) consultant, the restaurant has reviewed its food safety standards and retrained each employee and will continue to do so.

Estee said that Reno Provisions has also stopped its special food processing operations until the WCHD and the USDA review and certify the HACCP plan for special processes.

A statement from the WCHD on [Tue 24 Nov 2015], said that they have had 22 confirmed and probable _E. coli_ O157 cases since mid-October 2015 and that a majority of the cases came from the Twisted Fork serving the tainted chocolate mousse. They also said that WCHD epidemiologists and environmentalists traced the source through hundreds of hours of investigation, interviewing people and testing foods.

[Issues with proper kitchen hygiene continue to contribute to foodborne illness. In this case, the problem occurred by cross-contamination of the dessert mixer by using it for meat, thereby introducing the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ into the dessert processing. - Mod.LL
