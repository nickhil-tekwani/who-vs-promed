A worker at a horse ranch in the north has been diagnosed with [a] hantavirus [infection], the 1st case in Taiwan this year [2022].

The patient, who is in his 40s, has no travel history and is believed to have contracted the virus from contact with mice feces at the workplace. Rats, the carrier of the virus, are frequently sighted at the farm he works at, according to the man.

He started exhibiting symptoms of the disease including fever, chills, and muscle pain on 12 Feb [2022]. The symptoms persisted, so he sought medical assistance on 14 Feb [2022], after which he was hospitalized and diagnosed with the virus, said the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC).

The man has been discharged from the hospital and is in stable condition. Contacts and people who live with him have not shown symptoms, while disinfection and an investigation have been carried out at the horse ranch.

Taiwan reported 10 hantavirus cases in 2021, including people in Kaohsiung, Taipei, New Taipei, Taoyuan, Changhua, and Taichung, per the CDC.

Hantaviruses are contracted through contact with rodent urine or feces, rodent bites, or objects contaminated with the virus. Some strains could result in severe diseases in humans, such as hantavirus hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, which may cause diarrhea, vomiting, renal failure, and even death.

People are advised to sanitize their living environment and storage facilities with a diluted bleach solution to prevent the spread of the disease.

As noted earlier, Taiwan has had sporadic cases of hantavirus infections in recent years, with the Taiwan CDC indicating that there were 10 cases last year (2021). The case above is the 1st diagnosed for 2022.

The hantavirus involved is not stated, nor is the species of rodent identified. However, the mention that the horse ranch has rats leads one to suspect Seoul hantavirus, assuming that the rat involved was a brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_), the natural host of this virus.

In Asia, the 5 recognized hantaviruses, with their main rodent reservoir species, are Hantaan virus (_Apodemus agrarius_), Amur virus (_A. peninsulae_), Thailand virus (_Bandicota indica_), Seoul virus (widely distributed worldwide in the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_), and Muju virus (_Myodes regulus_). Hantaan virus and Seoul virus cause cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) frequently in Asia. People become infected when exposed to the virus in excreta (urine, saliva, and feces) of infected rats. It is not necessary to have contact with liquid urine; dust particles contaminated with dried urine may be inhaled. Transmission can also occur by rat bite.

An image of the brown rat, _R. norvegicus_, a reservoir of Seoul virus, can be seen at http://www.discoverlife.org/im/I_RB/0000/320/Rattus_norvegicus,I_RB27.jpg. - Mod.TY
