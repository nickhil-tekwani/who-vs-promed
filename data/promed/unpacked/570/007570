Eight children who visited a farm centre on Ynys Mon (Anglesey), North Wales
between 31 May and 15 June 1999 have been diagnosed with Vero cytotoxin
producing _Escherichia coli_ (VTEC) O157 infection. Five have required
admission to hospital, including two with haemolytic uraemic syndrome, but
all but one have now been discharged.The cases are aged 14 months to 11
years, who were exposed between two and eight days before becoming ill. This
is believed to be the first outbreak in Wales of VTEC O157 associated with a
farm visit.
The first case was reported to North Wales Health Authority on 9 June. On 15
June a history of visiting the farm was obtained from two further cases. The
owner closed the farm voluntarily that afternoon on advice from the
Department of Public Health. An outbreak control team learnt that the three
confirmed cases had all visited the farm on the 31 May. The cases had all
had direct contact with farm animals, although locally produced ice cream
was initially also considered as a possible vehicle. Five more confirmed
cases were identified and several other possible cases are being
investigated.
Isolates of VTEC O157 from four of the cases have been characterised by the
PHLS [Public Health Laboratory Service Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens,
showing that all are phage type 2, Vero cytotoxin 2, with the same VT2 gene
subtype, and have the same antimicrobial resistance markers. Further tests
including pulsed field gel electrophoresis are in progress.
