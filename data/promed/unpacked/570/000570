WHO And UNICEF Concerned About Measles Outbreak In Eastern And Southern Africa
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A steep increase in cases of measles in Eastern and Southern Africa
has put recent gains in reducing mortality due to this highly
contagious disease at risk of being reversed. As of mid-June 2010,
the outbreak has affected more than 47 907 children in 14 countries,
resulting in 731 deaths. The most recent confirmed measles outbreaks
were reported from Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia.

The measles control strategies being implemented in the region
include: a 1st dose measles immunization through routine infant
immunization programmes; a 2nd opportunity measles vaccination to
children during supplemental immunization activities (SIAs) or during
a routine service delivery schedule during the 2nd year of life; high
quality disease surveillance supplemented with laboratory
confirmation; and case management.

In order to ensure protection from outbreaks, at least 90 percent of
all children in each district and at national level need to be
vaccinated through routine immunization. 2 doses of the vaccine are
recommended to ensure immunity, since about 15 percent of children
vaccinated at 9 months, fail to develop immunity from the 1st dose.
The African Region of the World Health Organization (WHO) has
attained 92 percent reduction in measles mortality between 2000 and
2008 through the implementation of these strategies, with the support
from the Measles Initiative.

The current wave of measles outbreaks comes as a result of gaps in
the implementation of the control strategies. These gaps have been
caused by inadequate financial commitments from governments and
partners. Due to these shortfalls, routine immunization coverage has
declined and in some districts it was not possible to reach all
children. Moreover, in some countries (Malawi, Mozambique, South
Africa, Swaziland and Zimbabwe) certain groups of the population
refuse to immunize their children. In 2009, more than 2.4 million
children in the Eastern and Southern Africa sub-region (20 percent of
all children younger than one year) were not reached by routine immunization.

Measles is among the world's most contagious diseases, which can
cause severe complications such as pneumonia, diarrhea and
encephalitis, among others, and death. It can easily spread through
coughing and sneezing.

With technical support from UNICEF, the WHO and other partners and
the generous financial support from the Central Emergency Response
Fund (CERF), the UK Department for International Development (DFID),
the European Union and other international and local partners,
countries affected by the recent outbreaks are conducting proper
outbreak investigations, providing appropriate case management,
conducting response vaccination campaigns at various scales and
working to strengthen routine immunization and disease surveillance.

Most countries have conducted limited response vaccination campaigns
to stem the outbreaks. South Africa, for example, launched a measles
vaccination campaign on 12 Apr 2010 for children aged 6 months to 15
years after facing a huge measles outbreak in 2009/2010, and Zimbabwe
followed from 24 May to 2 Jun 2010.

Other affected countries (Lesotho, Malawi and Zambia) are planning to
conduct supplemental immunization activities as well, but funding has
not yet been secured. Similarly, Comoros, Ethiopia and Madagascar
have planned to schedule follow up supplemental immunisation
activities in 2010. However, these countries are experiencing large
funding gaps which will compromise the quality of the SIAs.

"Measles IS easily preventable. In order to sustain our efforts and
successes in combating the disease, we urgently need to fill the
funding gaps. Otherwise, we will again see more measles deaths in the
near future," said UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern
Africa, Elhadj As Sy.

"To eliminate the risk of resurgence, countries must continue
follow-up vaccination campaigns every 2 to 4 years until their health
care systems can routinely provide 2 doses of measles vaccination to
all children and provide treatment for the disease," said WHO
Regional Director for Africa, Dr Luis Gomes Sambo.

Update on the measles outbreak in the affected countries in Eastern
and Southern Africa (data as of 15 June 2010):
Zimbabwe (8173 cases, 517 deaths)
Zambia (817 cases, 33 deaths)
Tanzania (20 cases, 1 death)
Swaziland (529 cases, 0 death)
South Africa (15 520 cases, 18 deaths)
Namibia (3722 cases, 58 deaths)
Mozambique (434 cases, 0 death)
Lesotho (2406 cases, 28 deaths)
Kenya (295 cases, 0 death)
Ethiopia (2108 cases, 8 deaths)
Botswana (1048 cases, 0 death)

[The overall case fatality rate of is 1.53 percent, ranging from less
than 0.1 percent in Botswana and less than 0.2 percent in Swaziland
to 4 percent in Zambia and 5 percent in Tanzania. The reasons for
this divergence possibly reflect varying standards of health care in
individual countries of the region, and perhaps influence of other
factors such as the prevalence of HIV infection. - Mod.CP]
