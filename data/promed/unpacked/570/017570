Ukrainian officials said on Tuesday they had confirmed another
outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain of bird flu in 3 poultry farms on
Ukraine's southern Crimean peninsula.
Oleg Rusetsky, head of the region's agriculture department, said that
the region had been under surveillance soon after the 1st H5N1 cases
were confirmed in 11 Crimean villages in mid-December 2005. He also
said this most recent confirmation of the deadly strain was received
on Monday and emergency measures were taken to prevent further spread
of the virus.
The deadly virus has so far been identified in 14 Crimean villages
and authorities have culled more than 70 000 domestic fowl.
There has been no report of human infection by the virus in Ukraine yet.
