Hong Kong steps up vaccinations against bird flu
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The government is stepping up its programme of vaccination in the battle
against H5 avian influenza. The expanded vaccination effort will cover all
chicken farms within 5 km of Pak Sha [in the eastern New Territories].
This will increase the number of vaccinated farms to 80. The Agriculture,
Fisheries and Conservation Department says this will give it access to more
data to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccine under local conditions.
