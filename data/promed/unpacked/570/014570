Abstract
--------
Waning humoral immunity in coronavirus disease patients has raised concern over usefulness of serologic testing. We investigated antibody responses of 58 persons 8 months after asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. For 3 of 4 immunoassays used, seropositivity rates were high (69.0%-91.4%).

[Selection criteria for this study were PCR confirmed cases in individuals in isolation in a community treatment center during the period 5 Mar 2020 to 9 Apr 2020. Those selected for the study were less than 65 years old, had no underlying disease or had well-controlled underlying disease, temperature was less than 38 deg F (100.4 deg F) with or without antipyretics (fever lowering medications) and no history of dyspnea (shortness of breath). Hence, these were mild clinical cases (51 individuals) or asymptomatic infections (7). Serology was done on all participants 8 months following enrolment in the study.

The study used 4 different immunoassays: an antinucleocapsid (anti-N) panimmunoglobulin (pan-Ig) electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA; an anti-N IgG ELISA; an antispike (anti-S) IgG; and an anti-S1 spike subunit IgG ELISA.

Results included: anti-N pan-Ig detected in 53 (91.4%), anti-N IgG in 15 (25.9%), anti-S IgG in 50 (86.2%), and anti-S1 IgG in 40 (69.0%) (p less than 0.01).

The authors commented that while other studies demonstrated waning immunity, it may have been a function of the serologic test used in the studies, in light of the variable findings of their study over the 4 different assays used.

Choe and colleagues demonstrated waning immunity following mild illness with the MERS-CoV during the outbreak in 2015, but persistent immunity one year after severe disease. In that study, a single MERS-CoV S1 ELISA kit was used for serologic determination. It is now 5 years since that outbreak. It would be interesting to see if seropositivity persisted 5 years.

Duration of immunity will be important in deciding how often boosters are needed following vaccination. But the question to be addressed is which serologic tests would be the best for addressing this.

[B] Bangladesh: variant strain

https://www.thedailystar.net/frontpage/news/no-need-panic-over-new-strain-2016793


Scientists in Bangladesh have reported a new COVID-19 strain, which is a bit similar to the one found in the UK recently. Analysing data in early November [2020], a team of Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research [BCSIR] observed new mutations in novel coronavirus strains. "We observed that one new strain was similar to the one found in the United Kingdom. It was not 100 per cent the same. We will start working on it again," Dr Selim Khan, principal scientific officer at the BCSIR and also the head of the team, told The Daily Star yesterday [24 Dec 2020].

Talking to this reporter later in the day, BCSIR chairman Prof Md Aftab Ali Shaikh advised people not to panic and said the research was still under way. Experts also advised against panic, saying the new strain found here has already been in the country for almost 2 months at least and that no surge in COVID-19 cases has been reported yet. They stressed [the importance of] continuing to follow the health rules to stay safe amid this pandemic.

In response [to the UK's new variant strain], at least 40 counties closed their borders or cancelled flights from the UK, in efforts to curb further spread of the virus. Yesterday [24 Dec 2020], state minister for civil aviation Md Mahbub Ali, however, said Bangladesh's air communications with the UK would continue as usual until further notice. As many as 165 passengers from the UK landed at Sylhet Osmani International Airport yesterday [24 Dec 2020] and headed home after showing COVID-19 negative certificates to the airport authorities.

"A total of 17 mutations have been reported in the new strain found in the UK. Only one of those has a bit of similarity with the identified mutations in Bangladesh," Dr Marufur Rahman, deputy programme manager, Center for Medical Biotechnology of DGHS's [Directorate General of Health Services] Management Information System (MIS) told The Daily Star yesterday [24 Dec 2020]. The BCSIR study team, led by Dr Salim Khan, analysed data on 263 cases of genome sequencing collected from different areas in 8 divisions between [7 May and 31 Jul 2020], said BCSIR officials.

The study suggested that the COVID-19 mutation rate (12.6 per cent) in Bangladesh was higher than the global average of 7.23 per cent, they said. Dr Mushtuq Hussain, consultant of the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), said, "If the new variant was found here 2 months ago, there have not been many changes in the virus's behaviour. The transmission rate has been in a certain range."

Dr Mahbuba Zamil, head of virology at the Institute of Public Health, echoed his statement. "The record of the transmission rate does not suggest anything exceptional," she said.

According to the DGHS, a total of 538 genome sequencing have been done so far from Bangladesh. "It is too little. We need more and more genome sequencing," Dr Marufur Rahman said.

The authorities reported that 19 more people died of COVID-19 in 24 hours as of 8:00 am yesterday [24 Dec 2020], taking the death toll to 7378. As many as 1234 new cases were reported in those 24 hours. With this, the total number of COVID-19 cases reported in the country reached 506 102. The death rate stood at 1.4 per cent, the DGHS said in a release. So far, 446 690 patients recovered with 2345 in those 24 hours, added the release.

[Although genome sequence of one of the strains of the virus has been found to be somewhat similar to the variant virus circulating in the UK, as indicated in the news report above, it is reportedly not 100% the same, suggesting the need for more verification of sequence data to assess the possible introduction of the variant to the country.

The daily case positivity against the total number of samples tested over the last week in Bangladesh was just below 10%, except one day when it was slightly above 10%. - Mod.PKB

The 7-day rolling average of daily COVID-19 cases in India has fallen below 25 000 as the pandemic continues to recede in the country. For any given day, the 7-day rolling average of daily cases is the average of the number of infections detected over the last week, including that particular day. It provides a more reliable estimate of COVID trends by evening out the day-to-day variations.

So, while there have been daily variations with the case count rising on some days, the 7-day rolling average has consistently declined on all days in December [2020] so far, highlighting the overall falling trend in cases. The last time the average was below 25 000 was on [10 Jul 2020], when the COVID count in the country was steadily rising. The average fell below 25 000 on [Wed 23 Dec 2020].

On [Thu 24 Dec 2020], India recorded 23 454 fresh cases, nearly 1700 less than the tally on the previous day. At 337, the day's death toll remained at nearly the same level as the past seven-eight days although it was the highest in the past 5 days.

Although the case count has fallen significantly in Maharashtra, the state continues to report a relatively high number of fatalities. On [Thu 24 Dec 2020], it registered 89 deaths, accounting for more than 1/4 of all fatalities from the virus. Delhi recorded a rise in deaths, with 37 on [Thu 24 Dec 2020], the 2nd highest in the country, followed by Bengal (32), UP (23), Kerala, and Chhattisgarh (both 22).

While a new strain of coronavirus has become a challenge across the globe, Pakistan reported the highest number of deaths during the 2nd wave of COVID-19, and the 2nd highest since the beginning of the pandemic, as 111 people died in the country on [Thu 24 Dec 2020]. The Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) said that it is vigilant about the emergence of the new variant of SARS-CoV-2 in Pakistan, which has been detected in the United Kingdom. However, special assistant to the prime minister (SAPM) on health Dr Faisal Sultan admitted that the situation in the health sector of Pakistan was depicting a gloomy picture. He said the situation was the 'worst' when compared to other South-Asian countries. According to the data of the National Command and Operation Centre, as many as 111 deaths and 2256 new cases were registered in a single day. Earlier 124 people had died of COVID-19 on [15 Jun 2020]. During the 2nd wave 105 people had died on [15 Dec 2020].

While national positivity ratio was 6.07 per cent, highest positivity ratio was observed in Karachi at 12.45%, followed by Peshawar 10.96% and Abbottabad 7.81%. Moreover 2361 COVID-19 patients were in a critical condition in different parts of Pakistan. According to a statement of NHS Ministry, the situation in Pakistan was being closely monitored and all passengers arriving from the UK were being evaluated. "As of [Thu 24 Dec 2020], the new variant of coronavirus has not been detected in Pakistan," it said, adding the National Institute of Health (NIH) was sensitive to and on alert regarding this new strain for its timely detection and handling.

Asked how the new variant of the virus could be traced, he said the NIH routinely did genetic sequencing for all polio virus detections. "The same polio programme staff is supporting NIH in COVID-19 diagnostics. As per reports genetic variation seems to have enhanced virus transmissibility however, it's not more pathogenic than the previous versions," he said.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 25 Dec 2020 at 06:24 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 10 147 468 / 147128 / 106
Bangladesh: 506 102 / 7378 / 45
Pakistan: 467 222 / 9753 / 44
Nepal: 256 592 / 1808 / 62
Afghanistan: 51 595 / 2135 /54
Sri Lanka: 39 231 / 185 / 9
Maldives: 13 558 / 48 / 88
Bhutan: 541 / 0 / -

Over the last 2 weeks or so, the daily reported COVID-19 cases in Nepal were decreasing continually. After a temporal surge of daily new cases in Sri Lanka, a slight reduction of total cases was observed last week compared with the previous, showing a tendency of stability of newly reported cases. The number of newly reported daily cases in Bangladesh remained stable at just below 10% over the week. The daily new cases in Pakistan seemed to be also stable currently in the 2nd wave, but daily mortality is seemingly increasing because 111 deaths were reported on 24 Dec 2020, the 2nd highest single-day count ever in the country since the diagnosis of the disease, and the highest so far during the 2nd wave. The total number of COVID-19 cases in India dropped further at around 25 000, and even on one day of the last 7 days, the count was below the mark of 20 000, indicating a sharp decline of daily laboratory cases since the disease reached its peak, near the mark of 100 000.

The lowest number of confirmed cases recorded so far is from Bhutan, and there is no mortality attributed to COVID-19 reported from the country. It is the only country left so far in South Asia with no COVID-19 deaths reported. - Mod.PKB]

[3] Stillbirths
Date: Sun 27 Dec 2020
Source: Al Jazeera [abridged, edited]
https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/12/27/stillbirths-overlooked-consequence-covid19-pandemic


Stillbirth -- which is the loss of a baby before or during delivery, after 24 weeks of pregnancy -- has been on the rise around the world during the coronavirus pandemic.

In London, one hospital noticed that stillbirths almost quadrupled during the city's spring [2020] lockdown. According to the Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom, the national average rate for stillbirths is 3.8 per 1000. St George's Hospital typically has a rate of almost half that, but between February and June [2020], it increased from 2.38 to 9.31 per thousand, a recent study showed (ref 1). In July [2020] alone, the rate was 14.2 per 1000, a 6-fold increase from normal.

Similar data was reported in other UK hospitals, while a study in Italy found stillbirths tripled there in the spring (ref 2). A large study in Nepal found that stillbirths had increased from 14 per 1000 to 21; the most significant increase came during the 1st month of lockdown (ref 3) . The same trend has been reported around the world, from India to Iran, Pakistan to Peru, and Bangladesh to Brazil.

Stillbirths can occur due to complications with a pregnancy or delivery, or because of issues with the mother's health. Initially, some doctors thought the increase in stillbirths must have been caused by coronavirus infections. But it became apparent that this was not the case. At St George's Hospital none of the women who had stillbirths tested positive and doctors have said there is no evidence that suggests COVID-19 infection increases the chances of a stillbirth. So doctors searched for other causes.

When not to 'stay at home'
--------------------------
During the early days of the pandemic, it was difficult to know the many consequences of lockdown. By the end of March [2020], the message in the UK, as in many countries, had been "stay at home". There was regular news of overwhelmed staff and hospitals overrun by coronavirus patients. Shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) have been well documented all across the globe. In New York, nurses resorted to wearing plastic bin bags.

Dr Asma Khalil, a professor of obstetrics and maternal-foetal medicine and co-author of the London hospital study, found that by April [2020] very few pregnant women were coming in. "We had empty clinics," she said. Women, it seemed, thought they should not, or could not, come in for their antenatal care appointments. The switch to remote appointments and the lack of clarity from governments about whether antenatal care was an essential visit caused confusion. Combined with nervousness about the virus itself, many hesitated.

"If the baby's not moving, if you have reduced foetal movements, that's usually an alert to come to the hospital to have a check-up to make sure the baby's ok," said Khalil. "If you delay that for another day, maybe it's too late."

Healthcare has changed during the pandemic. In the UK, 89 per cent of women had remote antenatal appointments during the pandemic, according to a survey by BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology. In India, hospitalisations in general halved (PDF) and in Nepal births in hospitals also declined by 50 per cent.

Monitoring a foetus's health during pregnancy involves many processes that have to be done in person with a doctor or midwife. Despite some countries making an effort to provide pregnant women with blood pressure testing kits at home, they are unable, for example, to listen for the foetal heartbeat or take uterus measurements themselves.

"Although the virtual route can be very good, it's not the same. It may well be that a caregiver can see something in an interaction with a woman, or a woman will open up about worries or concerns in a face-to-face interaction," said Mary Renfrew, professor of mother and infant health at the University of Dundee in Scotland. "Continuity of care makes a difference to stillbirths. If continuity of care is disrupted then that in itself will have an impact."

In many countries, there were additional impediments preventing women from getting care. In India, many patients use public transport for emergency visits but during the lockdown, as in Nepal and Uganda too, all public transport stopped, often including taxis, meaning many women could not get to their appointments. For a while, Uganda even banned the use of private cars during the lockdown.

In Iran and Peru, some hospitals were so overwhelmed that maternity units were closed, deemed non-essential, to make room for COVID care, local midwives told Al Jazeera. Many other hospitals are short-staffed and, as people get ill, staff have been moved from maternity wards in order to care for COVID patients.

Mistaking symptoms
------------------
"A pregnancy, the birth of a child, doesn't stop for a pandemic," said Margarita Perez Silva from the College of Obstetricians of Peru. In Peru and Iran, midwives have reported that maternal deaths have been on the rise this year.

To complicate matters, some women and healthcare staff are mistaking symptoms of pregnancy complications for signs of COVID-19. Franka Cadee, president of the International Confederation of Midwives, said, "If women have a headache or don't feel well, they could well think 'oh dear I have COVID', when actually they could have high blood pressure", which can be a symptom of pregnancy complications. With so much focus on the coronavirus, pregnant women and healthcare professionals may misunderstand the symptoms. And if a woman decides to self-isolate on the basis of this misunderstanding, it may be an unnecessary risk for the baby.

In Uganda, some women have been denied entry to overwhelmed hospitals because their shortness of breath was suspected to be COVID, according to Dr Peter Waiswa, an associate professor at Makerere University School of Public Health, in the capital Kampala. Shortness of breath, however, is usual during pregnancy. A similar issue occurred during the 2014 Ebola outbreak; doctors in Sierra Leone mistook pregnant women's bleeding for Ebola symptoms and turned them away.

'A perfect storm'
-----------------
The hesitation to go in for appointments, an inability to travel to the hospital, and the complications caused by closures and a lack of staff, amounts to what Renfrew describes as "a perfect storm for women".

Stress can be harmful to pregnancy and women are coping with a lot. In addition to fear of infection, the pandemic has brought about widespread economic worries which have hit women hardest. According to the United Nations, women make up 70 per cent of the world's health workers and 1st responders, and women tend to work in sectors which have been worst hit by the pandemic. There is also the stress of being in lockdown.

Less privacy at home means that women may not be able to open up about issues on the phone or on the family computer while other family members are around. As a result, matters that would normally be discussed in the privacy of a doctor's office could go unnoticed.

In addition, there has been a rise in incidents of domestic abuse during the pandemic, and, as Cadee points out, "domestic violence often originates in pregnancy". According to the World Health Organization (PDF), between 13 and 50 per cent of women experienced domestic violence for the 1st time during pregnancy and, according to another study, pregnant women who experience domestic violence are 37 per cent more likely to experience complications that result in hospitalisation, such as hypertension, premature rupture of membranes, and anaemia.

For many higher-income countries in the northern hemisphere, the rise in stillbirths during the 1st wave of COVID-19 in spring [2020] prompted an effort to ensure antenatal care and encourage women to attend appointments in person. The authors of the study in London have said that the stillbirth rate has gone down since the summer. It seems that wealthier countries had the opportunity to react to the warning signs in spring. But the same cannot be said of low and middle-income countries which face more challenges in containing the virus and spreading awareness to healthcare staff and pregnant women. Data are difficult to come by, but Cadee has spoken with midwives in the 142 countries where the ICM has a membership. She said, "The stories were nearly all similar." Stillbirths are rising and women are unable to get the proper care.

In some cases, staff exhaustion is causing the maltreatment of pregnant women. Healthcare workers may be insensitive or not communicate clearly and there have even been reports of some women getting caesarean sections without being properly informed beforehand. Due to social distancing regulations, many have to go to appointments, as well as give birth, without the support of their partner; this can increase the chance of unclear communication between the mother and healthcare staff.

Fear of hospitals, and possible infection, still linger in many countries. In Nepal, the lockdown was lifted in August [2020] but the trend continued. "The critical factor, we think, is the fear factor," said Ashish KC, a perinatal epidemiologist at Uppsala University and author of the Nepal study. He compared it with the lingering distrust of healthcare facilities seen in the aftermath of West Africa's Ebola epidemic, and said it could be a long time before women feel safe returning to hospitals. The continuing public transport disruption has also broadened an already stark social divide, as only wealthier women had the means to reach the hospitals.

A baby boom -- at the worst possible time
-----------------------------------------
In April [2020], the United Nations Population Fund predicted that 47 million women would lose access to contraception because of the pandemic. This, they modelled, could lead to 7 million unwanted pregnancies. These could not come at a worse time.

For many of the poorest women around the world, the boom will be involuntary, brought about by the confinement of lockdown and an inability to access family planning. This boom, of babies conceived early in the pandemic, is putting pressure on maternity services now as COVID cases rise and lockdowns tighten. And with it, the risk of stillbirths also grows.

So far, none of the companies producing coronavirus vaccines tested their vaccine on pregnant women during trials, meaning they have no data on this specific demographic. Countries are taking different approaches as to whether to recommend pregnant women take the vaccine; many will therefore be hesitant. Meanwhile, midwives worry that maternity staff will be low on the priority list of healthcare workers to get the vaccine -- in the same way that they were low on this list to get PPE [personal protective equipment] during the 1st wave of the virus in March [2020].

As COVID cases increase, with new strains of the virus emerging and lockdowns tightening, it could mean more anxiety and complications for pregnant women who are already stressed due to the pandemic.

While the initial thought is that COVID-19 infection was responsible for the increase in stillbirths, the "etiology" is more insidious -- decreased antenatal care. Adding pregnancy outcomes to the collateral damage seen resulting from overwhelmed health services and fear of exposure to the SARS-CoV-2. This saga has not ended and the data are frightening. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218].

Data by country, area, or territory for 27 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC27_1609110632.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 48.0% of daily case numbers and 44.4% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 34.4 million cases. Canada, Costa Rica, and El Salvador, among other countries, did not report any new cases in the past 24 hours.

- The European region reported 35.1% of daily case numbers and 37.9% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 25.2 million. Countries not reporting cases include Spain, Belgium (3 cases), Switzerland, Sweden, Israel, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, among others.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.6% of daily case numbers and 5.5% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.82 million cases. Iran is dominant with decreasing daily case counts now just below 5800, followed by Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia, Lebanon, Palestinian Authority, UAE, Egypt, and Jordan. Iraq reported more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000.

- The African region reported 3.7% of daily case numbers and 4.2% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.83 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance, reporting over 11 000 new cases, followed by Nigeria, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Algeria, Rwanda, Mali, Ghana, Uganda, Eswatini/Swaziland, Senegal, Namibia, Kenya, Burkina Faso, and Zambia. Cote d'Ivoire, Madagascar, DR Congo, Botswana, among other countries, did not report any new cases.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.0% of daily case numbers and 1.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 1.05 million cases. Japan is dominant -- approaching 4000 cases, followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 6.7% of the daily newly reported cases and 6.8% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.8 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant although with decreasing numbers of cases (less than 19 000), followed by Indonesia (just over 6700), Myanmar, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. Thailand reported 110 cases.

Impression: Weekend artifact has impacted reporting, especially in the Americas and European regions. In spite of that, there is a continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 82% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases and deaths on a daily basis, even in the face of decreased reporting over the weekend.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 27 Dec 2020, is an excellent visual representation of the pandemic. - Mod.MPP]

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (140 000), UK (32 340), and Russia (28 284) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 7321 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (27 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (8 countries) include the USA, UK, Russia, India (18 574), Brazil (18 479), Turkey (14 205), Germany (12 153), and Canada (10 404). A large number of countries have not reported (including Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and Costa Rica), or fewer new cases have been reported (United States, Poland, Peru among others).

A total of 44 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 21 of the 44 countries that reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 9 are from the Americas region, 8 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 are from the South East Asia region, 2 are from the Western Pacific region, and one from the African region. Clearly related to weekend reporting artifact.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 12.2%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 10.4%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the United States show a 14.6% decrease in daily reported cases and an 11.6% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: While the global daily reported cases continue to increase with over 400 000 newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours (a considerably lower number of cases reported due to the holiday/weekend effect). Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts even with reductions in daily case reports due to the holiday weekend, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, South East Asia, and Western Pacific regions. South Africa has crossed the 1 million mark for cumulative case reports making it the 18th country to do so. - Mod.MPP]
