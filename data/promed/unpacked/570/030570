Over the weekend of 10-11 Jun 2006, 5 cows and one bull were found
dead in a Kittson County beef herd. A blood sample was collected and
sent to the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic
Laboratory in Fargo, North Dakota. On 14 Jun, the Board received
confirmation from the lab that the sample was positive for the
disease. The herd had not been vaccinated for anthrax.
The bacterium that causes anthrax, _Bacillus anthracis_, is naturally
occurring throughout the United States. Anthrax spores in the soil
can become active following flooding and subsequent drought, posing a
risk to grazing livestock. Though anthrax can infect humans, these
sporadic livestock infections pose no known threat to public health.
Grazing animals are most likely to become infected with anthrax in
the summer after periods of heavy rain, flooding, or
excavation. Cases typically occur in areas where animals have
previously died of anthrax. Anthrax is not spread by animal-to -animal contact.
"Typically, heavy rain and flooding brings spores to the surface
where grazing animals ingest them" said Board of Animal Health Senior
Veterinarian Dr. Linda Glaser. "That's why it is so important for
livestock producers in northwestern Minnesota to vaccinate their
livestock for anthrax." Information on vaccinating animals can be
obtained by contacting a veterinarian.
Any animal that dies suddenly of unknown causes in northwestern
Minnesota should be treated as an anthrax suspect. Producers should
contact their veterinarian immediately so blood samples can be
submitted for testing. Any remaining animals should be vaccinated
and treated for anthrax. Autopsies should not be preformed on suspect
carcasses as the procedure can result in contamination of surrounding
soil. After confirmation of the disease, carcasses must be
incinerated onsite. All suspect cases of anthrax must be reported to
the Minnesota Board of Animal Health by calling 651-296-6831.

Some additional anthrax information. I called the clinic for
additional information.
Original report was Sunday (11 Jun 2006) with 3 dead animals. A total
of 17 animals in the herd. As of today a total of 6 dead. MN state
vet's office was there yesterday. Remaining animals vaccinated and
treated with penicillin. Will revaccinate in 2 weeks. [It is better
to treat with antibiotics first and then 7-10 days later vaccinate. - Mod.MHJ]
This herd had never been vaccinated previously. They were on pasture.
Some question as to involvement of water. Report relayed to me that
there is standing water on this ground where standing water has not
been reported previously.
NDSU will be putting a news release out today. [See above] Main
point, "It's not too late to vaccinate!"

[There is an excellent map on the website showing Kittson County in
the farthest northwest corner of the state. The nearby counties of
Roseau, Polk, and Pennington had outbreaks in 2005. In March 2006 the
State Veterinarian posted an advisory to all the ranchers in
northwest MN to get their cattle vaccinated.

And yet again -- it seems to be fore-ordained -- this Kittson County
rancher thought he could get away with not vaccinating and is now
paying for it. Whether there had been anthrax on this ranch earlier
and the spores had been floated up by the flooding or they have it in
the background in deer is hard to tell. Sometimes I suspect the one,
other times the other. A brief note from Terry Boldingh says that 2
herds southeast of this herd had large losses in the 2001 outbreaks,
which makes me suspect undetected background cases in the interim.
Single deaths in cattle are rarely investigated -- and in deer,
never. - Mod.MHJ]
