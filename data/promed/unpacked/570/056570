C. Causal agent: vesicular stomatitis virus serotype Indiana.
Source of agent / origin of infection: equids that came from neighbouring

Possible causes of the outbreak are the constant movement of animals into the
area, the proliferation of insects during the rainy season and the large
amount of surface water in this low-lying area.
Control measures:
- quarantine;
- movement control inside the country;
- screening;
- zoning.

[At this time of year in 2004, Bolivia had a small outbreak of Vesicular
Stomatitis (VS) involving 8 farms affecting both cattle and horses. The
greatest concern with VS is as a differential diagnostic condition for foot
and mouth disease (FMD). The inclusion of horses in the current outbreak
rules out FMD in this case. The above sounds very similar to the recent
report from Belize. - Mod.PC]
