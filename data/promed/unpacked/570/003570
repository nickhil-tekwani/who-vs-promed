The Egyptian Health Ministry confirmed on Saturday [30 May 2009] the 77th
infection with H5N1 virus. A baby girl, aged 14 months, contracted the
highly pathogenic [avian A (H5N1) influenza] virus because she was in
contact with domestic birds in a village located in Daqahliya, north Cairo,
the ministry's spokesman Dr Abdulrahman Shahin said in a press briefing.

The baby was hospitalized 5 days ago suffering from bird-flu-like symptoms
including high temperature, running nose, and respiratory disorder. She was
diagnosed as H5N1-positive, so she has been treated with the antiviral drug
Tamiflu [oseltamivir], Dr Shahin revealed. The patient is being relocated
to Manshiyat Al-Bakri Hospital, Cairo for further medication, he added.

The case pushed to 77 Egypt's national tally of the fatal disease, with the
death toll amounting to 27 since the outbreak of the highly contagious
virus in February 2006. The National Higher Commission against Bird Flu has
adopted a new preventive methodology to control the spread of H5N1, a
subtype of the influenza A virus commonly known as bird flu, which can
cause illness in humans. The methodology involves the medical and municipal
authorities as well as the mass media.
