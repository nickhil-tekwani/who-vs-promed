In response to your request for further information about the
respiratory illness in Cambodia, [below is] the following response. I
hope this is useful in clarifying the current acute respiratory
infection (ARI) activity in Cambodia:

There is generally a high background level of ARI in children in
Cambodia. In mid-June 2005, clinicians from 2 paediatric hospitals in
Phnom Penh raised the alert that they were observing an increase in
the number of outpatients and admissions with acute respiratory
infections (ARI).

Staff from the Ministry of Health have been collecting simple
demographic data on number of outpatients, admissions and deaths
amongst children at the National Paediatric Hospital and following up
with health staff in all of the 24 provinces of Cambodia. Preliminary
results suggest the outbreak of ARI in children began in the 2nd week
of June in the major urban areas of Cambodia (Phnom Penh, Battambang,
Siem Reap and Kampong Cham). Remote and less populated provinces
report that there have been no increases in attendances to health
centres or hospitals.

Data from the National Paediatric Hospital indicates that there had
been a gradual increase in ARI outpatient consultations since early
May when there were approximately 100 cases per week, but there was a
distinct peak (n= 245 cases) in the week beginning 5 Jun [2005] and
the number of cases are currently returning to baseline levels.
Admissions also peaked in the week beginning 5 Jun [2005] (n=109
cases), but remained at this level for 2 weeks before starting to
decline to baseline levels. 2 deaths have been reported, but the
aetiological agent responsible for the deaths could not be determined
as samples were not collected. Both deaths occurred in children under
5. Since the outbreak began in 5 Jun [2005], nearly 90 percent of
outpatients and all admissions have been in children aged under 5
years.

A total of 43 samples have been collected from paediatric hospitals
in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap and 27 have already been completely
tested at Pasteur Institute, Phnom Penh. Pasteur Institute has been
running PCR to screen for influenza A, influenza B, RSV [respiratory
syncytial virus], human-Metapneumovirus, and Para-Influenza 1-4
viruses. Of the samples processed, 13 have tested positive for
influenza B. In Siem Reap and Phnom Penh, several co-infections of
influenza B and RSV have been found as well as isolated infection
with RSV.

The Ministry of Health has been conducting an education campaign
encouraging good hygiene. The focus has been on how to limit the
transmission of respiratory pathogens.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Drs. Sovann, Buchy, and Miller for
their report on the epidemiologic and laboratory aspects of the
investigation into an observed increase in respiratory illness in the
under-5-year-old population in Cambodia. ProMED-mail very much
appreciates receiving a report from authoritative sources in response
to a Request for Information (RFI). This type of report is far
superior to reliance upon lay newswires for information on
epidemiologic investigations. So far it does appear influenza B
virus is the predominant respiratory isolate, in keeping with
identified influenza activity elsewhere in the general area. The
identification of RSV in some specimens is also not surprising, as it
is a significant pathogen for the under-5-year-old population
worldwide. - Mod.MPP]
