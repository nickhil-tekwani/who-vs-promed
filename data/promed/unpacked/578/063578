After conducting their own investigation into a deadly outbreak of
listeriosis, federal health officials confirmed Wednesday [3 Oct
2010] that the source was a San Antonio produce company temporarily
shut down by the state.

Sangar Produce & Processing Co. had disputed earlier test results
from the Texas Department of State Health Services that found
_Listeria_ on cut celery, arguing that independent tests by a private
lab on the same batches failed to find any contamination. But the
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said in a statement it found
_Listeria_ bacteria -- not only on celery but also in several places
in the building, including work surfaces, after a visit 14 and 15 Oct 2010.

The strain of _Listeria_ was genetically matched to people sickened
in the outbreak, the FDA statement said.

"These results come as no surprise to us," said Carrie Williams, a
spokeswoman for the state health department. "This adds to the body
of evidence, and it further confirms the fact there were serious
_Listeria_ issues inside the plant. If there was any doubt out there,
this erases it."

The company's lawyer remained skeptical. "The FDA and the state have
not turned over to us the documentation supporting their findings,"
attorney Jason Galvan said in an e-mail. "We cannot comment on these
most recent findings until the documentation is provided for
independent evaluation by our experts." Still, he added, "We are
working closely with the FDA and the state in the hopes of reopening soon."

The FDA also released its own inspection report that found a number
of sanitary problems at the plant, including improperly refrigerated
foods, inadequate hand-washing facilities, and a number of examples
where vegetables and equipment might have come in contact with water
on the plant's floor.

Over several months, 10 people in Bexar, Travis, and Hidalgo counties
were infected with the same strain of _Listeria_ -- 5 of them
fatally. Of the deaths, 3 were from Bexar County and a 4th -- a
Guadalupe County resident -- died [in San Antonio]. Laboratory tests
by DSHS now have conclusively linked 7 of the 10 infections to the
company's celery, one more than when the plant was shut down, Williams said.

Citing the possibility of cross-contamination, the state ordered a
recall of all products -- not just celery -- shipped from the plant
since January [2010]. The recall involved thousands of pounds of
produce distributed to more than 300 customers, including
restaurants, hospitals, school districts, military facilities, and
large wholesalers.

Sangar officials unsuccessfully sought to reopen the plant last week
[week of 25 Oct 2010]. An administrative hearing has been scheduled
for 17 Nov 2010. Williams said it would require "a series of negative
test results on food and environmental samples before the company can reopen."

_Listeria monocytogenes_, a bacterium commonly found in soil, can
easily contaminate meat and vegetables. When eaten, it rarely causes
serious illness in healthy people but can be deadly in those with
weakened immune systems such as the elderly, the very young, and
pregnant women.

Of the 10 Texas cases, all were frail and elderly with underlying
health problems. Many were hospitalized before or during their infection.

[As previously reported by ProMED-mail (Listeriosis, fatal - USA
(02): (TX), recall 20101021.3813), the Texas Department of State
Health Services (TDSHS) has determined that the source for
listeriosis in 7 of 10 cases was chopped celery sold by Sangar Fresh
Cut Produce in San Antonio. All of the reported cases were in people
with serious underlying health problems; 5 of the 10 died. _Listeria
monocytogenes_, the bacterium that causes listeriosis, which had been
found in the chopped celery, may have also contaminated other food
products manufactured in the facility. As a result, Sangar Fresh Cut
Produce plant was closed and all products shipped from there since
January 2010 were recalled; these products were distributed to
restaurants and institutional facilities such as hospitals and schools.

The news release above now states that the Food and Drug
Administration also found _Listeria_, not only on celery but on
several environmental surfaces in the plant, as did the TDSHS, and
that the DNA fingerprint of strains of _Listeria_ isolated at the
Sangar plant matched that of clinical isolates from people sickened
in the outbreak. The matching DNA fingerprints confirms the link
between the Sangar celery and the cases of listeriosis.

A detailed discussion of listeriosis can be found in ProMED-mail post
20071230.4186.

All cases of the Texas listeriosis outbreak occurred in Bexar,
Travis, and Hidalgo counties. Travis County is part of the city of
Austin metropolitan area. Austin is the capital of the state and is
located in Central Texas. San Antonio, the county seat of Bexar
County, is located 80 miles [129 km] to the southwest of Austin.
Hidalgo County is located on the Rio Grande River at the border with Mexico.
