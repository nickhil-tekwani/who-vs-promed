Abstract. The epidemiology of rabies in France and western Europe has changed during the past 22 years. In France, rabies in non-flying terrestrial mammals was declared to be eliminated in 2001, and the risk of rabies is now limited to contact with bats, rabid animals illegally imported from rabies-enzootic countries, and traveller exposure in enzootic areas. We analysed the epidemiology of rabies in France from 1995 to 2016, describing and analysing data on human rabies surveillance as well as data on post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) collected from the network of French anti-rabies clinics. Over the study period, 7 individuals were diagnosed with rabies in France, all of whom were infected outside mainland France. PEP data analysis revealed an expected overall decrease in PEP administration for individuals exposed in mainland France, but there was still overuse of anti-rabies drugs, given the very low epidemiological risk. On the other hand, a significant increase in PEP delivered to individuals exposed abroad was evidenced. These epidemiological trends indicate that clear guidelines should be provided to support physicians' efforts to adjust rabies risk assessment to the evolution of the epidemiological situation.

[The following extracts from the paper are presented for subscribers' convenience.

"1. Exposure in French overseas territories
From 1995 to 2014, 3965 PEP courses were delivered following an exposure in French overseas territories, including 3550 (89.5 percent) PEP courses following an exposure in French Guiana. The cumulative exposure to dogs, bats, and cats accounted for 2015 (50.8 percent), 838 (21.1 percent), and 325 (8.2 percent) PEP courses, respectively. Compared with individuals exposed in mainland France, those receiving PEP after an exposure in French overseas territories were more likely to be aged under 15 years and male (p  less than 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively), and animal exposure was more likely to be due to bats or NHP (p  less than 0.001) and less frequently to dogs and cats (p  less than 0.001).

"2. Exposure abroad outside mainland France and French overseas territories
Among individuals who received PEP, the number and proportion of exposure that occurred outside mainland France and French overseas territories has increased progressively since 1995, from 354 (5.7 percent) in 1995 to 1482 (33.5 percent) in 2016, and currently represents one-third of all PEP courses delivered. In 2016, according to the data published by the French Directorate General for Enterprise, the estimated incidence of PEP courses was 5.5 per 100 000 trips outside France of French residents aged 15 years or older and 0.4, 1.4, 17.9, and 56.7 per 100 000 trips to Europe (not including France), the Americas, Africa, and Asia/Oceania, respectively. Exposure occurred in Africa for 5677 travellers (30.3 percent) and, in particular, in 3 North African countries, with Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria accounting for 66.6 percent of all travellers to Africa seeking PEP in France. A total of 5751 (30.7 percent) travellers were exposed in Asia, 60.1 percent of whom had been to Thailand, Indonesia, or India. Lastly, 1990 (10.6 percent) travellers had been to countries in Europe and 1332 (7.1 percent) to the Americas. Oceania only accounted for 95 PEP courses (0.5 percent). During the study period, the destinations of travellers requiring PEP changed, with destinations in Asia becoming more frequently visited than African destinations since the late 2000s. The proportion of individuals exposed in Asia among all PEP administered after travel increased from 29.7 percent in 1995 to 63.1 percent in 2016."

The rabies outbreak has spread to more parts of Sarawak with 5 new areas, including 2 in Miri.

The state disaster management committee said the new areas were Jalan Teng Chin Hua in Sibu, Jalan Kilang in Bintangor, Jalan Airport Lama in Kapit, and Piasau Jaya and Lutong Shell in Miri.

This brings the total number of rabies-positive localities in Sarawak to 41, it said in a statement yesterday [Thu 27 Sep 2018].

The committee also appealed for public cooperation to contain the disease. It reminded dog owners to have their pets vaccinated against rabies and to call the nearest veterinary office if their pets show signs of the disease, such as turning aggressive, biting objects, excessive salivation, and lack of coordination.

"Those who have not had their dogs vaccinated must bring them to the nearest divisional veterinary office or private veterinary clinic for vaccination," the committee said. "An annual booster is required to ensure your pet is fully protected."

The Veterinary Services Department and Health Department issued a reminder that in the event of a dog bite, the wound should be washed with soap and running water for at least 15 minutes.

At least 50 villagers have been vaccinated against rabies after they ate meat from a dead cow, which was later found to have been infected with the deadly virus. The cow, owned by B.C., died of unknown causes on Thu 13 Sept 2018. Fifty residents of Ban Nong Khai Hia in Sida district ate some of its meat before tests proved the animal had rabies, sparking fears they had been infected too.

When the cow died died, livestock officials told the owner to bury it after they cut off the head, which was sent for lab tests at Sida Hospital to determine the cause of death.

B.C.hired 5 neighbours to dig a hole in the ground and bury the dead animal. However, the men cut off the 2 hind legs before burying it and then shared the meat among other villagers, according to officials.

On Tue 18 Sept 2018, a lab test confirmed the cow had died from rabies.

All who admitted to having consumed some of the meat have now been vaccinated. Villagers who came in contact with dogs in the village were also urged to get rabies jabs.

[The people who handled the dead animal could have been exposed to rabies if they had physical contact with its head and/or the spinal cord. The meat, however, is not considered to be a source of human infection. Since the animal died but was not slaughtered (reportedly), its meat should have been banned from the food chain anyway. - Mod.AS].

A total of 8 people died of dog rabies in Western Visayas from January until August this year [2018], a Department of Health (DOH) official here said on Monday [24 Sep 2018].

In a press conference, Ame Liz G. Mardoquio, regional rabies program coordinator of the DOH-6, said 4 of the deaths recorded are children below 15 years old.

"The youngest victims were 2 5-year-old children," she said. However, she refused to give further details about the victims.

The number of deaths due to rabies has prompted health authorities to urge local government units (LGUs) in the region to reactivate their municipal rabies council and enforce ordinances, particularly on responsible pet ownership and impounding of stray dogs, to curb dog-bite cases.

Of the 8 deaths, the province of Negros Occidental has the highest with 4 cases and one each in the provinces of Antique, Capiz, and the city and province of Iloilo.

Mardoquio said there are also 5 additional reported deaths from 1 Sep to 23 Sep 2018, but these are yet to be investigated.

Last year, 14 people in the region died of dog rabies.

Based on the DOH-6 data, the number of dog-bite cases in the region already reached 51 967 from January until June this year [2018]. Most cases are in Iloilo province with 17 051, while Iloilo City has the least with 804.

Mardoquio urged LGUs to strengthen their vaccination program by vaccinating more than 70 percent of their dog population.

To date, the island province of Guimaras; Boracay in Malay, Aklan; and the island barangays in Concepcion, Iloilo -- Tambaliza, Taloto-an, Makatunao, and Butlog Daku -- are considered rabies-free.

She also encouraged victims of dog bites to visit animal-bite treatment centers in the region.

"They should not be complacent, because a simple scratch can carry rabies. They should always consult a doctor," she said.

Currently, there are 47 animal-bite treatment centers in the region.

Meanwhile, Iloilo province, through its health and veterinary offices, celebrated on Monday [24 Sep 2018] World Rabies Day with the theme, "Rabies can be prevented: be a responsible pet owner. Share the message; save a life."

Elementary students from various public schools in the province gathered to compete in the poster-making contest and quiz bee in line with the celebration.

A 3-year-old girl and her father, 40, from the center of the country, were bitten Sunday [23 Sep 2018, afternoon] by a jackal wandering through Tel Dan Nature Reserve. The 2 arrived at Ziv Hospital in Safed, and their condition is light.

The girl was bitten in the back and the father in his right arm. The 2 received emergency-room treatment, which included a rabies vaccination.

The Nature and Parks Authority said the jackal who had bitten the 2 was shot. The nature reserve has been closed, and searches are underway.

A short time later, another girl was reported being bitten by a jackal in Nahal Snir. Her condition is light.

[Since 1 Jan 2018, 55 lab-confirmed cases of rabies have been registered in Israel. This included 40 jackals, 7 cattle, 5 dogs, and one each of badger, sheep, and horse. Of the 40 rabid jackals, 27 were recorded during January-February 2018. The notable, stormy rabies event in jackals, which spread throughout northeastern Israel since July-August 2017, seems to have peaked: there were 6 cases in March [2018], 1 in April [2018], 1 in May [2018], 2 in June [2018], 2 in July [2018], and 1 in August [2018], totaling 40 so far. Not a single rabies case, in any species, has been reported since 7 Aug 2018, as of 26 Sep 2018. For the dynamic rabies maps of (the entire) 2017 and the 1st 9 months of 2018 (as of 26 Sep 2018), see https://tinyurl.com/yb4yg7u6 and https://tinyurl.com/y6udncad, respectively.

A detailed analysis of this unusual event in Israel's golden jackals should become available for a lesson to be drawn. The analysis is expected to satisfactorily explain the reasons of the event taking place in spite of the oral wildlife vaccination in force. - Mod.AS
