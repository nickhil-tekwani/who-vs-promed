First detection of wheat stripe rust in Western Australia: evidence for a
foreign incursion

Wheat stripe rust (caused by _Puccinia striiformis_ f.sp. _tritici_) [Pst]
was reported for the first time in Western Australia (WA) in August 2002.
Although present in eastern Australia since 1979, Pst has failed to move
westwards due presumably to quarantine precautions, the influence of west to
east weather movements and the imposing geographic barrier afforded by the
Nullarbor Plain and Great Victoria Desert.
The characteristics of the initial pathotype detected in WA indicate
a foreign pathogen incursion, suggesting that the latter factors
continue to restrict east to west movement of this pathogen in
continental Australia.
The recent detection of Pst in WA represents the colonization by Pst
of the last major wheat-producing region of the world that had
remained free of the disease, despite rigorous quarantine measures
that have contributed to disease exclusion since the establishment of
the grains industry in the 1800s.
The initial infections were recorded in cv. Stiletto (carrying
resistance gene Yr6) in the south eastern wheatbelt of WA. Within 2
weeks, there were 15 confirmed occurrences and within 4 weeks
confirmed infected fields had increased to 95.
By the end of the wheat growing season in 2002, the disease was
present over a wide area. Rapid spread of stripe rust in the early
phase of the epidemic was consistent with experiences in eastern
Australia in 1979 (5).
The initial disease sample from Newdegate was accessioned as part of
the annual pathogenicity survey at the Cereal Rust Laboratory, Plant
Breeding Institute Cobbitty (Sydney) in order to determine the Pst
pathotype. The pathotype was virulent for Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, YrA and
avirulent for Yr1,Yr2, Yr3, Yr4, Yr5 and several uncharacterized
resistances in the differential cultivars (3) as modified by (6).
Field responses on cultivars carrying Yr17 (eg Camm) suggested
avirulence for this gene.
The unique combination of virulence/avirulence characteristics in
this pathotype indicated that the origin of the initial isolate was
not eastern Australia. The Newdegate isolate differed in at least 5
pathogenicity features compared with pathotype 110 E143 A+, which was
common in eastern regions during the previous 2 years. The pathotype
of the Newdegate sample was concluded to be 134 E16 A+, based on
modified international pathotype nomenclature (6).
Further preliminary evidence was obtained from an examination of DNA
extracted from urediniospores of the Newdegate isolate. Examination
of only 5 AFLP primer combinations revealed considerable polymorphism
between the Newdegate isolate and the 10 isolates of eastern
Australia and New Zealand, with an average of 22 percent polymorphism
among amplified loci. This finding further supported the hypothesis
of a foreign incursion of Pst to WA.
The characteristics of the Newdegate isolate appear to contrast in 2
virulence features with those reported from South Africa (1).
Features of the east African Pst population in the early 1990s
(Kenya, Ethiopia), including pathotypes with various combinations of
virulence, may resemble those of the Newdegate isolate (4).
A recent report from the USA suggests that Pst race 79, first
detected in 2000 (2), has pathogenicity features very close to those
of pathotype 134E16 A+. However further work will be required to
explore possible origins of the Pst incursion into WA.

[In addition to wheat, Pst infects other cereals including barley
(_Hordeum vulgare_), rye (_Secale cereale_) and triticale (an
artificial genus hybrid of tetraploid or hexaploid wheat (_Triticum_
spp.) as the male plant, and diploid rye (_Secale cereale_) as the
female in the cross) as well as several grass hosts. Stripe rust
occurs worldwide in production areas, especially at higher elevations
which tend to have higher relative humidity and cooler temperatures.
The disease is prevalent this year in the Pacific Northwest of USA
where it is the worst outbreak in many years. Disease management
employs the use of resistant cultivars and applications of chemical
fungicides containing propiconazole.
I cannot close without recognizing an event of some historical
significance to plant pathology. As reported above, the last major
wheat production area in the world has fallen victim to stripe rust
infection, despite all attempts to prevent a foreign incursion of the
fungus. Unfortunately, Nature has her ways. -Mod.DH]
