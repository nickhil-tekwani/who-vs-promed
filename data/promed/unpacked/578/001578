Avian influenza situation in Indonesia: update
----------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health of Indonesia has announced a new case of human
infection of H5N1 avian influenza. A 34-year-old female from South
Jakarta District, DKI Jakarta Province developed symptoms on 25 May
[2010], was hospitalized on 27 May and died on 1 Jun 2010. Laboratory
tests were positive for H5N1 virus infection. The case was possibly
infected from environmental exposure to manure in her plant nursery.

Of the 166 cases confirmed to date in Indonesia, 137 have been fatal.

[This is the WHO confirmation of the most recent case in Indonesia
reported on Fri 2 Jun 2010. Unusually the source of the infection is
thought to be poultry manure used in horticulture.

This is only the 4th case and 3rd death reported in Indonesia so far
this year (2010). Overall it brings the global total of cases of
avian influenza (H5N1) virus infection to 500, and the death toll to
296. The fatality rate in Indonesia now stands at 83 percent,
compared with the global rate of 59 percent.
