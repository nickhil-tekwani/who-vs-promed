Two Egyptian children have H5N1 bird flu
----------------------------------------
Two 4 year old Egyptian children have contracted the highly pathogenic H5N1
bird flu virus, raising to 76 the number of cases reported in Egypt, the
state news agency MENA reported on Tuesday [26 May 2009].

Egypt has been hit harder by bird flu than any other country outside Asia
and has seen a surge of cases in recent weeks. The children, a boy and
girl, were from different areas of Sharkiya province in the Nile Delta
region. Both fell ill after coming into contact with birds with the virus.

The avian [A (H5N1) influenza] virus rarely infects people, but experts say
they fear it could mutate into a form that humans could easily pass to one
another, sparking a pandemic. Most of those infected have previously been
in contact with infected domestic birds in a country where 5 million
households raise poultry as a significant source of food and income.

Since 2003, the H5N1 virus has infected more than 400 [429 as of 22 May
2009] people in 15 countries and killed more than 250 [262 as of 22 May
2009]. It has killed or forced the culling of more than 300 million birds
in 61 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.
