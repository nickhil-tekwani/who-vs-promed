The Centre for Disease Control in the Northern Territory has issued an alert for the fungal infection sporotrichosis, after 10 people contracted the disease in the Top End. The disease is normally associated with the hay industry, and the outbreak is understood to be the 1st in the Northern Territory's history.

Infectious disease physician Dr Anna Ralph says there have been 7 cases since April 2014. "Anyone who has handled hay and has lumps or skin sores that won't heal should see their doctor for treatment with prescription antifungal medication," said Dr Ralph. "As well as affecting skin directly exposed to hay, the disease can also appear further up the limb and along the lymph ducts, creating a series of cord-like lumps."

Dr Ralph says the outbreak appears to have been caused by the sale of moldy hay. "At the moment, it seems to be related to the fact that some hay became moldy; it got wet and dried out ... and got this sporotrichosis bug in it. All the Darwin cases that we've seen have been from people handling hay." Dr Ralph says residents should wear protective clothing when handling hay.

Hay has previously been associated with sporotrichosis outbreaks in Western Australia and Queensland.

[The following information regarding sporotrichosis is from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/sporotrichosis/:

"Sporotrichosis is an infection caused by a fungus called _Sporothrix schenckii_. The fungus lives throughout the world in soil, plants, and decaying vegetation. Cutaneous (skin) infection is the most common form of infection, although pulmonary infection can occur if a person inhales the microscopic, airborne fungal spores. Most cases of sporotrichosis are sporadic and are associated with minor skin trauma like cuts and scrapes; however, outbreaks have been linked to activities that involve handling contaminated vegetation such as moss, hay, or wood.

"The 1st symptom is usually a small painless nodule (bump) resembling an insect bite. The 1st nodule may appear any time from 1-12 weeks after exposure to the fungus. The nodule can be red, pink, or purple in color, and it usually appears on the finger, hand, or arm where the fungus has entered through a break in the skin. The nodule will eventually become larger and may look like an open sore or ulcer that is very slow to heal. Additional bumps or nodules may appear later near the original lesion. Most sporothrix infections only involve the skin. However, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, including the bones, joints, and the central nervous system. Usually, these types of disseminated infections only occur in people with weakened immune systems. In rare cases, a pneumonia-like illness can occur after inhaling sporothrix spores, which can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, cough, and fever.

"Most cases of sporotrichosis only involve the skin and/or subcutaneous tissues and are non-life-threatening, but the infection requires treatment with prescription antifungal medication for several months. The most common treatment for this type of sporotrichosis is oral itraconazole for 3 to 6 months. Itraconazole may also be used to treat bone and joint infections, but treatment should continue for at least 12 months. For patients with severe disease, and/or an infection that has spread throughout the body, a lipid formulation of amphotericin B should be used. Itraconazole can be used for step-down therapy once the patient has stabilized. Supersaturated potassium iodide (SSKI) is another treatment option for cutaneous or lymphocutaneous disease. SSKI and azole drugs like itraconazole should not be used during pregnancy. Treatment recommendations may differ for children."
