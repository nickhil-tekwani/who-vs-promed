SARS RULED OUT IN RESPIRATORY ILLNESS AT SURREY NURSING HOME
Laboratory findings at British Columbia Centre for Disease Control and BC
Cancer Agencys Genome Sciences Centre provide conclusive evidence the virus
responsible for an outbreak of respiratory illness at Surreys Kinsmen Place
Lodge is not the SARS corona virus.
We have clearly found large sequences of the virus that are not present in
the SARS coronavirus, said Dr. David Patrick, director of epidemiology at
BCCDC. The epidemiology and clinical evidence has told us all along this
illness we were dealing with was not Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and
now our laboratory findings corroborate this.
Further genome sequencing of the virus identified in the outbreak points to
a known family of human coronaviruses, related to OC43. The symptoms caused
by this family of viruses are consistent with those suffered by the
residents and staff at Kinsmen Place Lodge.
Our public health response was necessarily cautious until we figured out
what agent we were dealing with, said Dr. Perry Kendall, provincial health
officer for British Columbia. Our ability to respond quickly and
effectively has really shown the benefit of working collaboratively at all
levels and the value of having laboratory and research capacity within our
public health network.
After some preliminary laboratory findings indicated the possibility of a
SARS-like coronavirus, health officials at Fraser Health Authority placed
Kinsmen Place Lodge and a ward at Surrey Memorial Hospital on heightened
infection control precautions.
Given this new information, in consultation with the provincial health
officer and BCCDC we have decided to downgrade our precautions to normal
infection control protocol for respiratory illness at long-term care
facilities, said Roland Guasparini, chief medical health officer for
Fraser Health Authority. Staff remaining in quarantine will be released
and able to resume normal duties, and limited visiting will be allowed
again at Kinsmen Place Lodge. I am particularly grateful for the residents,
their families and staff who have been so cooperative in dealing with this
difficult situation.
Since the outbreak began in early July [2003], 96 residents and 51 staff have
suffered mostly mild cold-like symptoms such as runny nose.
Laboratory research continues to sequence the entire genome of the virus
responsible for the outbreak.

release.]
[Previous reports of apparent detection of a SARS coronavirus-like agent
(and human metapneumovirus) in some of the patients involved in this
outbreak were difficult to evaluate, in view of the lack of correspondence
of the clinical picture with that of the original SARS outbreak. The
reported failure to isolate a SARS coronavirus-like agent in cell culture
also suggested caution in interpretation of the initial reports. The
current report of the identification by extensive sequence analysis of a
virus closely resembling the human coronavirus OC43 makes more
sense. Analysis of the complete sequence of the SARS coronavirus
(Frankfurt 1 strain) has revealed that this virus resembles -- but is
distinct from -- members of the group 2 coronaviruses, which include the
common cold virus known as human coronavirus OC43. It may be that the
sequence similarity between these 2 viruses has been the cause of false
positive results in PCR-based diagnostic tests employing short templates.
Nonetheless, there is still some discordance between the results obtained
by different laboratories and between the results of nucleic-acid based
diagnostic tests and serology.
While there are data on the prevalence of human metapneumovirus in the
normal population, so far no screening seems to have been undertaken
anywhere to determine whether there are one or more SARS coronavirus-like
agents in circulation. The presence of such agents would not have been
detectable prior to the availability of SARS coronavirus diagnostic
reagents, and the lack of such information impedes understanding of the
origin of these outbreaks. - Mod.CP]
[It is comforting to know that the epidemiologic conclusions reached
earlier held up with laboratory confirmation. Good, careful epidemiologic
and clinical investigations early on suggested that the outbreak was not
due to a close relative of the SARS-associated coronavirus. It did not
behave epidemiologically (or clinically) like SARS, but more like the
"common" respiratory infections seen in the "pre-SARS" era. The initially
cautious response on the part of the health and public health sector in
Vancouver, and public health measures for possible SARS were appropriate,
allowing time to fully sort out what was going on. Much is still unknown
about the SARS-associated coronavirus, so a prudent/cautious approach to
investigation is fully warranted -- panic though, is not. - Mod.MPP]
