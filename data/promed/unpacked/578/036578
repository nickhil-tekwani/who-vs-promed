As of the end of September [2010], 2 new positive cases of bird flu [avian
influenza A/H5N1 virus infection] have been reported based on results from
the Central Laboratory of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Research and
Development Agency: case MM (male, 35 years) who lives in West Jakarta, and
case LH (female, 40 years) in Depok, West Java. For case MM, the onset of
illness with symptoms of fever was 16 Aug 2010.

Two days later, MM went to a general practitioner and was immediately
referred to a hospital in West Jakarta. On 24 Aug 2010, the patient was
diagnosed with suspected bird flu, and nasal and throat specimens were
taken. However, the patient's condition worsened, with severe pneumonia
symptoms. The patient died on 27 Aug 2010.

Case LH, a 40 year old housewife, became sick on 9 Sep 2010 with symptoms
of fever, cough, and runny nose. On 12 Sep 2010, this new patient was
treated in the emergency room at a hospital in East Jakarta. The next day,
the patient was transferred to another hospital. After 3 days of treatment,
the patient's condition had not improved, and lung X-rays showed a picture
of pneumonia. The patient was diagnosed with bird flu and was referred to
the Friendship Hospital on 16 Oct 2010 [misprint for 16 Sep 2010?]. In the
avian influenza referral hospital, the patient was treated in an isolation
room and given standard therapy. Lung X-rays showed pneumonia expanding and
worsening. Finally, the patient died on 17 Sep 2010.

The director general of disease control and environmental health, in
accordance with International Health Regulations, has reported these
fatalities to the World Health Organization.
