Usutu virus activity in Austria in 2004
---------------------------------------
Dead bird surveillance for Usutu virus (USUV) activity was continued this
year. Here we report the results which gave some new insights into the
transmission dynamics of this new pathogen in Central Europe. In total, 222
dead birds were analyzed, 154 of which were blackbirds. The majority of the
birds originated from the eastern part of Austria -- that is, from the city
of Vienna -- and the federal states of Lower Austria, Burgenland, and Styria.
Only 11 blackbirds were diagnosed USUV positive by reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry; in other
species no positives were detected.
The USUV positive birds were found dead between 31 Jul 2004 and 21 Sep
2004. The area where positive birds were found largely corresponds with the
2003 area of USUV activity. In 2004, the positive birds were found in the
cities of Vienna (1) and Graz (1), and the districts Baden (1), Neunkirchen
(2), Gaenserndorf (2), Wien Umgebung (2), Amstetten (1), and Guessing (1).
The most remarkable features of this year's surveillance were the
significant decline of positives compared with the previous 2 years and the
expansion of USUV activity to areas which were previously not known to be
affected: virus positive birds were found in the far west of Lower Austria
(Amstetten) and for the 1st time in the federal state of Styria (Graz).
However, these data underline that USUV has established "permanent
residence" in Central Europe with a tendency of continuous but slow spread.
The comparatively low level of this year's USUV activity is hypothetically
attributed to cool summer temperatures which might have been responsible
for prolongation of the extrinsic incubation period of USUV in mosquito
vectors beyond the life time of the vectors.

[Usutu virus (USUV) is a flavivirus closely related to West Nile virus.
Subsequent to its 1st isolation in South Africa, isolations have been made
from birds, mosquitoes and mammals, one from _Praomys_ (African soft-furred
rat), and one from a man with fever and rash. In Africa, the virus
circulates between birds and mosquitoes with mammals being inadvertent
hosts if bitten by infected mosquitoes. There are no reports of severe
disease in man.
USUV was known only in Africa prior to 2001, when it was isolated
unexpectedly from birds dying of encephalitis in Vienna, Austria. For
additional background, see 20040827.2394. - Mod.AS]
