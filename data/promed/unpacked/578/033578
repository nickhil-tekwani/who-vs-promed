Human Rabies Case, British Columbia, Canada - January 2003: Report by Dr.
Rob Parker, Deputy Medical Health Officer, Fraser Health Authority, British
Columbia, Canada
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
On Monday afternoon 3 Mar 2003, Fraser Health Authority (FHA)-Fraser North
Public Health was informed by the British Columbia Center for Disease
Control (BCCDC) and Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) about the death of a 52
year old Port Coquitlam man from suspected rabies. The patient had died in
VGH-ICU on 30 Jan 2003 of an undiagnosed neurologic illness, after initial
presentation into Royal Columbian Hospital (RCH) on 6 Jan 2003. The
post-mortem brain histochemical slides were first available for pathology
review the morning of 3 Mar 2003, when the diagnosis of rabies was first
raised. Brain tissue specimens were then sent via express courier overnight
to the national test laboratory in Ottawa, and we received notification of
confirmatory rabies DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) testing at 1 pm on 4
Mar 2003. Public Health preparations for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis
(RPEP) immunization of potentially exposed health care workers (HCWs) at RCH
and VGH began on 3 Mar 2003, and immunization of exposed staff began at both
sites at just after 2 pm on 4 Mar 2003.
Human Rabies Epidemiology
Worldwide, there are more than 50 000 human rabies deaths reported annually,
with about 30 000 deaths in India, and the rest occurring primarily in
Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Most cases are due to dog bites
(CCDR, Vol. 28, ACS-4, March 1, 2002),
Over the last half century, Canada and the United States (U.S.) have both
witnessed a substantial decrease in the incidence of human rabies,
corresponding to the dramatic decrease in rabies among domestic animals.
Concurrently, rabies among wildlife -- especially raccoons, skunks and bats
-- has become more prevalent. Since 1980 more than half of the human cases
of rabies in the U.S. have been associated with bat variants, and an
increasing percentage of these cases have been "cryptic" i.e. no known
animal bite or contact, with the diagnosis of rabies often made post-mortem
(Gibbons,RV. Annals of Emergency Medicine, May 2002, Vol.39,No.5).
This FHA case is the second ever-recorded person to have died from rabies in
British Columbia (BC), with the only other case being a 22 year old BC
college student who died in 1985 from a bat bite received in Alberta. The
current case did not travel outside of BC in the past year, so it is likely
that he was infected with rabies from a bat. Bats are the only species in
BC with on-going enzootic (endemic) transmission of rabies. The case was an
avid outdoorsman and hiker, though there was no mention by the case to
family members prior to illness of any bat (or other animal) bite or scratch
in the past year. The case had commented to family members previously that
he had been around bats in abandoned cabins in BC in the past year. Of the
six people who have contracted rabies in Canada since 1960, all died and
four were bat-related. The last case to have died from bat rabies was a 9
year-old boy in Quebec in September, 2000.
Clinical Human Rabies
Rabies virus causes an illness that affects the mammalian nervous system.
For humans infected with rabies virus, clinical illness develops in 75% of
cases within 90 days of exposure; in less than 5% it takes more than a year.
In humans there are two clinical presentations, furious (agitated) and
paralytic (dumb) rabies. The former is more common and associated with the
classical presentation that includes hydrophobia and/or aerophobia. Other
symptoms can include headache, fever, difficulty swallowing, drooling,
muscle spasm or weakness and strange behaviour. Most patients die within a
few days of the onset of symptoms. Paralytic rabies is less distinctive with
a more protracted clinical course, associated with local paresthesia and
progressive flaccid paralysis. The recent FHA case presented with the more
atypical paralytic form, and the initial working diagnosis was of atypical
Guillan-Barre syndrome. Regardless of the clinical presentation, once
manifest, rabies is almost invariably fatal.
Mode of Transmission
Rabies is spread through infected body fluids, usually saliva in a bite from
an infected animal. Human-to-human transmission of rabies is exceedingly
rare, with only a few cases in the medical literature (Plotkin, S. Clin
Infect Dis 2000;30:4-12). Two were due to infected corneal transplants.
There are no recorded cases of rabies transmission from patient-to-HCW.
Management of Health Care Workers at RCH and VGH Exposed to the recent human
rabies case
Although the risk of patient-to-HCW transmission of rabies is extremely low,
Public Health authorities made a decision early on Mon 3 March 2003 to offer
rabies mmmunizations (RPEP) to potentially exposed HCWs. Potentially exposed
HCWs were those who were or may have been in direct contact with the
paient's bodily fluids. The factors involved in the decision to recommend
immunization include: 1. The patient would likely have had rabies virus in
his bodily fluids throughout his hospitalization; 2. The patient was
undiagnosed for rabies or definitively for any infectious disease, and
therefore full contact precautions may not have been observed; 3. Rabies is
a universally fatal disease once symptoms commence; 4. There is no blood
test or any other test for incubating rabies; and 5. Rabies is prevented by
giving highly effective immunizations, if given prior to any clinical signs
or symptoms of rabies.
As of Fri 7 Mar 2003, approximately 300 HCWs at RCH and VGH combined had
been started on RPEP, which includes both rabies immunglobulin (RIG-single
dose, day 0) and rabies human diploid cell vaccine (HDCV - 5 doses, on days
0,3,7,14 and 28).
RPEP Vaccines
RIG (IMOGAM) provides immediate protection while the active antibody immune
response is stimulated by the HDCV (IMOVAX) vaccine. The dose of RIG is
based on weight, and, where there is no known wound (bite or scratch) site,
is usually delivered in a split dose to the gluteal muscles, due to the
8-10cc volume in an average sized adult. The HDCV vaccine should be given
in the deltoid muscle. An unavoidably delayed single dose of RIG should
not be administered if more than 8 days have elapsed since the first dose of
HDCV vaccine. There are no absolute contra-indications to either RIG or HDCV
vaccine in the setting of post-exposure rabies prophylaxis (due to the fatal
nature of rabies).
RIG is heat-treated and should present no risk of infectious or prion
disease. HDCV vaccine is inactivated and safe in pregnancy. Self-limited
local soreness can occur with both vaccines (25% with HDCV). About 5% of
HDCV recipients will experience headache and/or nausea. A few cases of
Guillan-Barre (GB) have occurred after immunization with HDCV among the
millions of immunizations given, but this rate is well below the natural
incidence rate of GB of 1 per 100 000 per annum, indicating no causative
relationship to the vaccine.
Community Rabies Risk and Bat Exposures
All human-bat physical contacts, "bat-in-room-with-sleeping-person"
situations, or "out-of-province" animal bites, should be immediately
referred to the local Public Health office for assessment -- including those
with delayed (> 2 months) presentation after bite occurrence, as there is no
"outer limit" of RPEP initiation. About 10% of found or human-contact bats
(more likely sick and/or injured bats) submitted from BC test positive for
rabies Bat bites and scratches are extremely small and can be easily
missed, and can occur unnoticed to people while sleeping or unconscious
(intoxicated). Rabies has been identified in all bat species in BC, and in
bat submissions from all over the province. Some bat species have longer
incubation periods and longer symptomatic (infectious) periods, favoring
spread in bat colonies through abnormal aggressive behavior and biting of
other bats.
Within BC, other animal bites of humans present a relatively low risk of
rabies exposure. For example, of the 362 animal submissions from BC to the
federal rabies testing (ADRI) lab in Lethbridge from January-September 2001,
only bats (20/257) were positive for rabies, and the other 105 animal
specimens of varied species were all negative. Occasionally in BC a non-bat
animal species (usually a carnivore) will test positive with a bat-strain of
rabies. The situation is different in the prairie region and in eastern
Canada, where other species such as skunks, racoons, foxes and other
carnivores are routinely found to be rabies positive on animal submissions,
as have some dogs and cats, and some cows and horses as well.

received preliminary PCR testing that the rabies virus strain in our FHA
case is a bat-related strain.]

A Further Comment on the Bat Population of British Columbia
-----------------------------------------------------------
Although I appreciate that saying British Columbia has a "bat problem" may
be shorthand for "healthy bat population, some of which may transmit
diseases such as rabies" the former implies that something should be done to
eradicate bats, which should clearly not be considered a suitable response.
