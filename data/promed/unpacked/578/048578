In recent days, ducks have been dying of infectious disease in the
Yashan and Xiaoping Management Areas of Xinhui District, in Jiangmen
City [Guangdong province]. Shiqin He, Director of the Xinhui District
Agricultural Bureau, confirmed to reporters yesterday [22 May 2007],
that in the past 2 or 3 weeks, over 1000 ducks had died of infection.
A committee of experts has preliminarily determined that these ducks
died of meningitis infection.
Yesterday [22 May 2007], Mr. Li, a duck farmer originally from
Zhejiang, told a reporter visiting the incident site in the Yashan
Management Area of Xinhui District, that more than 20 days ago, pigs
started to die of illness in the area, then spreading to neighboring
Xiaoping Management Area, and that [some] ducks have died on nearly
all duck farms.
"[Ducks] eyes turned red, heads swung wildly, and then they collapsed
and died," said Mr. Li, explaining circumstances before the ducks
died. He said these illnesses [sic] spread extremely fast through
duck flocks; within one day several hundred ducks can die on a duck
farm of several thousand ducks. Upon waking in the morning, dead
ducks can be seen as a spread of white. "Just yesterday, more than
100 ducks died on my farm. Now about 900 remain. And a duck farm in
Xiaoping Management Area filled a cement truck with dead ducks."
However, what worries Mr. Li more, is that his remaining 900 ducks
are still dying. A reporter observed 2 ducks swinging their heads
wildly, flipping about, and then falling to the ground, motionless.
Sources say that nearly all duck farms have experienced deaths of
ducks. Of these, Mr. Li's is among the worst. Mr. Li said "I
originally raised about 6000 ducks, but deaths have brought that
number to less than 1000 now remaining."
A water treatment plant lies on the shore of a river near this
Management Area. The intake lies in the middle of the river channel.
As a reporter approached the riverbank, a terrible odor was detected
and several rotting, featherless ducks were seen floating on the
water. When a high-speed ferry bound for Hong Kong and Macao passed,
the waves lapped against the riverbank, pushing a white bag toward
the shore, [which was found to be full of dead ducks.] "Those are all
dead ducks tossed in by local villagers and duck farmers," a laborer
working on the river dike said. Over the past 2 weeks, people have
been throwing dead ducks into the river. In the beginning, they were
thrown in broad daylight; later the Management Area and Water
Treatment Plant [authorities] were afraid it could affect water
quality, and prohibited anyone from approaching the river to throw in
dead ducks, so the villagers have since been secretly throwing them
in at night.
Yesterday [22 May 2007], Shiqin He, Director of Xinhui District
Agricultural Bureau, said that the local government has already
implemented disease prevention measures. Where ducks have died,
disinfection is carried out and free vaccines and new ducklings are
supplied, along with appropriate economic assistance. At present, the
phenomenon of dying ducks has already been brought under preliminary control.

[The newswire above is rather blurred. It is not clear on what
grounds an infectious agent, rather than other etiological factors
(including biological and chemical toxic factors) has been
incriminated as the cause of the described, acute, neurological
clinical symptoms and the reported mortality rates. Similarly, the
relevance of pig mortality, if confirmed, is in need of explanation.
In any event, avian influenza (in ducks and pigs), as well as
_Pasteurella anatipestifer_ and Newcastle disease (in ducks), deserve
to be included in the differential diagnosis.
The identity of the vaccines, reportedly applied to ducks, is also not clear.
It would also be of interest to note if all affected duck farms
obtain their feed supply from similar sources.
First-hand information from veterinary experts, including results of
laboratory investigations, will help. - Mod.AS
