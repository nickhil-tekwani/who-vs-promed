The problem of West Nile virus (WNV) infections of horses in the USA seems
to be aggravated, in that more than 10 000 horses were reported ill due to
WNV in 2002. If the present Fort Dodge vaccine might cause problems in
pregnant mares (a question: is this an inactivated or attenuated WNV
vaccine?), why not test (and eventually use) in mares the available
Japanese encephalitis vaccine, which should cross-protect mammals against
WNV infection? For details, see Viral Immunology vol. 13 (2000), no.4: p. 421.

[The Fort Dodge equine vaccine is an inactivated preparation that is
effective and safe, but requires administration in 2 doses to achieve an
adequate level of protection. No live attenuated vaccine is available at
the present time. Although all members of the family
_Flaviviridae_ exhibit antigenic cross-reactivity, there is little
evidence that cross-protection occurs to any significant extent. Even
viruses closely related by phylogeny -- such as the different serotypes of
dengue virus -- fail to provide significant cross-protection. It is
extremely unlikely that a live attenuated vaccine developed for control of
Japanese encephalitis in the human population would have any application in
the control of West Nile virus disease in equines.
Stephanie Church, news editor of "The Horse", did an excellent article on 9
Jun 2003 on the US West Nile virus vaccine and its alleged affects on mare
reproduction:
<http://www.thehorse.com/viewarticle.asp?fid=4440&dpt=5&n=&case=2>
She points out the thousands to millions of doses of vaccine that have been
used successfully to protect horses without adverse effects. This article
also describes the experience of some of the largest equine veterinary
clinics in the United States, who indicate they have not had problems with
the vaccine. - Mods.CP/TG]
