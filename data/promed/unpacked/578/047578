Republic of Congo: Ebola death toll up as patient refuses help
-----------------------------------------------
As of Mon 30 May 2005, the death toll from Ebola virus infection in
Republic of Congo has risen to 10. It reached this number on Thu [26 May
2005] after a patient refused medical aid from a team of experts, the World
Health Organization (WHO) has announced. In a statement, WHO said on Fri 27
May 2005 that the death occurred in the northern region of Cuvette-Ouest.
It stated that the population in the area was not being collaborative in
efforts to check the outbreak of the often-fatal hemorrhagic fever. "The
attitude of the population is hindering the strategy for dealing with this
scourge," WHO said. "It blocks the experts from taking biological samples."
On Mon 23 May 2005, the Republic of Congo government and WHO announced they
had quarantined the districts of Etoumbi and Mbomo in Cuvette-Ouest. A
medical surveillance team in the region is trying to monitor dozens of
people there who could be infected.
The virus takes 5-10 days to incubate, said an adviser to the Congolese
Ministry of Health, Jean-Vivien Mombouli. Thursday's death may be among a
2nd wave of infections, he said, as the victim's wife died on Wed 11 May 2005.
Ebola is transmitted through bodily fluids and tissue of people and
chimpanzees infected with the virus. It is one of the most virulent viral
diseases known to humankind, according to WHO.

[A total of 12 cases (one laboratory-confirmed and 11
epidemiologically-linked), including 9 deaths, were reported in the most
recent WHO update on 24 May 2005. It is presumed that the 10th death
described in this report is one of these 12 cases and that only 2 patients
survive. It is possible, however, that this is a new case and that the
outbreak has not yet been contained. Further information is awaited. - Mod.CP]

Correction
-----------
In a previous report on this outbreak (See: Undiagnosed deaths - Congo Rep.
(04): Ebola confirmed 20050518.1358), the Moderator [CP] commented that
"Angola and Republic of Congo have no common border."
This is not true. Republic of Congo has a border with the Cabinda enclave,
which belongs to Angola and is situated between Republic of Congo and the
Democratic Republic of Congo. Cabinda has a quite significant size.

[ProMED-mail apologizes for the inaccuracy. The 1247 sq km tiny, oil-rich
Angolan enclave of Cabinda is sandwiched between Democratic Republic of
