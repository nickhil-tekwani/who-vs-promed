Equine influenza, Senegal
-------------------------
Information received on [and dated] 6 Apr 2019 from Dr Mbargou Lo, [Director of Veterinary Service, Ministry of Livestock and Animal Production], Dakar, Senegal

Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 26 Mar 2019
Date of confirmation of the event: 2 Apr 2019
Report date: 6 Apr 2019
Date submitted to OIE: 6 Apr 2019
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence of a listed disease in the country
Causal agent: Equine influenza virus
Serotype: pending
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to the whole country.

New outbreaks (2)
Outbreak 1: Rufisque, Dakar
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Mar 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 7756 / 3 / 0 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the disease has been observed in draught horses and donkeys.

Outbreak 2: Diourbel, Diourbel
Date of start of the outbreak: 26 Mar 2019
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: village
Affected animals:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered
Equidae / 122 497 / 3648 / 2 / 0 / 0
Affected population: the disease has been reported in draught horses and donkeys.

Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 2
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Equidae / 130 253 / 3651 / 2 / 0 / 0

Outbreak statistics: [rates apparent, expressed as percentages]
Species / morbidity rate / mortality rate / case fatality rate / Proportion susceptible animals lost*
Equidae / 2.80 / 0 / 0.05 / 0
*Removed from the susceptible population through death, destruction, and/or slaughter

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: contact with infected animal(s) at grazing/watering, fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.), airborne spread
Epidemiological comments: equine influenza occurred as a result of strong winds and dust. Stray donkeys are the main animals affected and play a role in spreading the disease as well as the groupings at weekly markets and watering points.

Control measures
Measures applied: surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone; surveillance within containment and/or protection zone; quarantine; disinfection; ate and post-mortem inspections; vaccination permitted (if a vaccine exists); no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: movement control inside the country

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / Test date / Result
Livestock and Veterinary Research National Laboratory (national laboratory) / Equidae / reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/ 2 Apr 2019 / Positive

Future reporting
The event is continuing. Weekly follow-up reports will be submitted.

["Equine influenza is caused by 2 subtypes: H7N7 (formerly subtype 1) and H3N8 (formerly subtype 2) of influenza A viruses (genus _Influenzavirus A_ of the family Orthomyxoviridae); however there have been very few reports of H7N7 subtype virus infections in the last 30 years.

"In fully susceptible equidae, clinical signs include pyrexia, nasal discharge, and a harsh dry cough; pneumonia in young foals and donkeys and encephalitis in horses have been described as rare events. Clinical signs associated with infection in dogs also include fever and a cough; occasionally infection results in suppurative bronchopneumonia and peracute death. Characteristically, influenza spreads rapidly in a susceptible population. The virus is spread by the respiratory route, and indirectly by contaminated personnel, vehicles and fomites. The incubation period in susceptible horses may be less than 24 hours. In partially immune vaccinated animals, the incubation period may be extended, one or more clinical signs may be absent and spread of the disease may be limited. This makes clinical diagnosis of equine influenza more difficult as other viral diseases, such as equine herpesvirus-associated respiratory disease, may clinically resemble a mild form of influenza. Horses infected with equine influenza virus become susceptible to secondary bacterial infection and may develop mucopurulent nasal discharge, which can lead to diagnosis of bacterial disease with the underlying cause being overlooked.

"Equine influenza viruses are believed to be of avian ancestry, and more recent transmission of avian viruses to horses and donkeys has been recorded. The sequence analysis of an H3N8 virus isolated in 1989 from horses during a limited influenza epidemic in North Eastern China (People's Rep. of) established that the virus was more closely related to avian influenza viruses than to equine influenza viruses. Avian H5N1 has been associated with respiratory disease of donkeys in Egypt.

"Equine influenza viruses have the potential to cross species barriers and have been associated with respiratory disease in dogs primarily in North America. Isolated outbreaks of equine influenza have also occurred in dogs within the UK but the virus has not become established in the canine population. Close contact with infected horses was thought to be involved in each outbreak in the UK. Equine influenza viruses have also been isolated from pigs in central China (People's Rep. of). Despite the occasional identification of seropositive persons with occupational exposure there is currently little evidence of zoonotic infection of people with equine influenza.

"In endemic countries the economic losses due to equine influenza can be minimized by vaccination and many racing authorities and equestrian bodies have mandatory vaccination policies. Vaccination does not produce sterile immunity; vaccinated horses may shed virus and contribute silently to the spread of the disease. Appropriate risk management strategies to deal with this possibility should be developed."
