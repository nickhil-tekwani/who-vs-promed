Ascochyta threatens chickpea crop
---------------------------------
A Tamworth plant pathologist says instances of ascochyta are on the
rise in the north of NSW [New South Wales]. The fungal disease can
kill chickpea crops and cannot be removed from a plant once it sets
in. Chickpeas are a major part of the northern NSW crop industry and
contribute millions of dollars to local economies.

Industry and Investment Plant Pathologist Kevin Moore says it should
be easy for farmers to identify the disease. "It produces very
characteristic spots on the leaves and on the stems."

Dr Moore says wet conditions have spread the disease and farmers
should look at management options. "Susceptible varieties need to be
managed from the time they come out of the ground. They should have
had a fungicide before the first emergent rainfall event. There have
been a couple of reports of ascochyta in the new variety hatTrick, so
farmers should be aware of that."

[Ascochyta blight (AB) of chickpea is caused by the fungus _Ascochyta
rabiei_ and is considered the most important disease of chickpeas
worldwide. The pathogen attacks all aerial portions of the plant and
is specific to chickpeas. Disease development is favoured by cool,
wet conditions. Symptoms include spots and lesions on leaves, stems,
and pods, which may lead to partial wilting, or the whole shoot may
break off and the plant will die. Infected seeds are shriveled,
spotted, and discoloured.

The pathogen can survive on infected plant material for at least 2
years under dry conditions, but viability is lost rapidly in high
humidity. It is seedborne at a high rate of 50-80 percent. Seed
transmission is the primary mode of spread both locally and
worldwide. Disease management includes cultural methods, seed
treatment, prophylactic fungicide applications, and use of varieties
with improved resistance.

_A. lentis_ causes a similar blight in lentils and _A. pinodes_ in peas.
