Call for action to stop spread of 'toxic' MRSA
----------------------------------------------
Urgent action is needed by the Government to combat deadly new
superbugs that [can - Mod.LL] kill healthy young people, a disease
expert gave warning today, 24 May 2005.
Toxin-producing MRSA [methicillin-resistant _Staphylococcus aureus_]
strains similar to the one that killed an 18-year-old Royal Marine
trainee, are already a widespread medical problem in the USA and
account for the majority of _Staphylococcus aureus_ infections in
some areas.
The fit, young recruit developed necrotizing pneumonia and died 2
days after a cut on his leg that he sustained in training became
infected with an MRSA strain that produces the Panton-Valentine
toxin, an inquest heard this week.
Dr Mark Enright, a Bath University expert who is studying the
disease, called on the Government to set up an active monitoring
system, under which all suspicious cases must be referred to the
Health Protection Agency laboratories in Colindale, London. At
present it is left to hospitals to decide whether to submit swabs for
testing. Advice should be issued to all parents warning them to make
sure that they sterilize cuts and grazes on their children's skin and
cover the wound with a plaster, he urged. He criticised the
Government for failing to take a lead on the subject.
"So far the Government is just saying that the infection is really
rare and not to worry. But that is not good enough," Dr Enright told
Times Online.
"The Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) strains are already becoming a
very serious problem in the US. A doctor working in a Chicago
children's hospital has reported that the majority of the staph
infections treated there are now PVL-producing strains.
Cases have been reported in schools in France, Switzerland and
Australia as well as the USA, where it has affected prisons, health
clubs and the gay community. There are 6000 known cases in the city
of San Francisco. Problems are also now emerging in Asia, where a
hospital recently experienced a large number of cases.
On Fri, 20 May 2005, Dr Marina Morgan, a microbiologist at the Royal
Devon and Exeter Hospital, told an inquest into Mr Campbell-Smith's
death that she had seen 2 cases of the PVL-producing strain of MRSA
in 9 weeks.
But a spokesman for the Health Protection Agency (HPA) today said that PVL
was "extremely rare", adding "It's not something you're routinely going to
get [from] running through brambles." [Brambles are thorny blackberry
vines. - Mod.JW.] The HPA said PVL was produced by fewer than 1.6 percent of
strains of _Staphylococcus aureus_ found in the UK.
The recruit was 4 weeks from the end of his 32-week training course
when he reportedly scratched his legs while running on 31 Oct 2004.
He was admitted to the medical unit, and later taken to the Royal
Devon and Exeter Hospital, where he died on 2 Nov 2004. A post-mortem
examination showed heart and respiratory failure and traces of PVL
production were later found.

story=MJ2413107E&news_headline=superbug_mum:_im_lucky_to_be_alive>

A mum said she was "lucky to be alive" today after contracting a new
superbug which left her with a 4-inch scar as an ugly reminder of her
ordeal.
The mother, 33, was breastfeeding her baby at Derriford Hospital in
Plymouth when she contracted Panton Valentine Leukocidin
(PVL)-containing community-acquired MRSA, which killed a teenage
Royal Marine, and passed it on to her little daughter.
After catching the infection in the hospital's maternity unit, both
developed huge abscesses. The mother told how hers swelled to an
astonishing 20cm long and required an emergency operation to drain it.
She said: "I feel lucky to be alive. It was a bit of a shock to hear
news of the marine killed by the same disease and makes me think my
case was played down, as they always said to me I never had MRSA.
Fortunately it wasn't as severe for us, but considering how huge my
abscess was it is scary to think what would have happened if it
burst. And more awful to think my daughter could have died, I just
can't imagine it."
The full-time mum, from Laira in Plymouth, believes the ordeal in October
2003 started when she was breastfeeding her daughter in hospital. The infant
didn't take to it initially, and her mum is convinced one of the many nurses
who helped may have passed on the disease that she in turn gave to her baby.
The mother also believes the same reason lies behind up to 9 other mums
contracting the same infection in the maternity unit.
She said: "When I spoke to other women in the hospital, we had all breastfed
while we were in hospital and got a lot of manhandling while we were doing
it."

[These 2 pieces, neither of which reports a recent case, were
published in the wake of the release of the results of the inquest
regarding the fatal case. They illustrate the spectrum of the
disease that can be associated with community-acquired (CA) MRSA,
which has been well-described in previous postings on this infection
on ProMED.
In CA-MRSA strains, the _mec_ gene -- which causes resistance to all
beta-lactams by a change in penicillin binding proteins -- is
contained in a gene cassette substantially smaller than any of the 3
associated with hospital strains. Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL)
appears to be frequently if not uniformly associated with CA-MRSA
strains, as compared with hospital strains, which could produce
increased virulence in CA-MRSA. CA-MRSA strains contain other toxins
as well.
As reviewed recently (Chambers HF: Community-associated MRSA -
resistance and virulence converge. N Engl J Med 2005; 352:1485-87),
the evidence that PVL is, in fact, the major virulence factor in
CA-MRSA is largely circumstantial, but there are substanital links
between PVL and virulence. It is possible that PVL is only a marker
for other virulence factors such as a gamma-hemolysin, enterotoxin,
toxic shock toxin, or other toxins similar to PVL.
Until the advent of CA-MRSA, PVL had been found only in
methicillin-susceptible strains of _S. aureus_. Initially discovered
by Van de Velde, PVL was distinguished from hemolysins in 1932 by
Panton and Valentine. In the 1930s, PVL-containing strains were
associated with cutaneous and invasive staphylococcal infections, as
is the case in the current CA-MRSA infection spectrum. Currently in
the USA, more than 95 percent of infections are skin-related.
Invasive infections such as those referred to in the posting are, as
stated, quite rare.
PVL is a bicomponent cytotoxin made up of class S and class F
proteins which together act to create holes in the cellular membrane.
The toxin is referred to as synergohymenotropic, as it consists of 2
proteins working synergistically to puncture a membrane as a
octomeric unit.
Although the postings refer to CA-MRSA as a "superbug", unlike
hospital strains, CA-MRSA isolates are often resistant only to
monobactam antimicrobials and retain sensitivity to other agents
including clindamycin to which hospital-acquired MRSA strains do not.
