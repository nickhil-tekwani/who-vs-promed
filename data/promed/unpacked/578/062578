A ban on bird imports to Puerto Rico has forced the cancellation of
more than 100 cockfights, dealing a blow to a lucrative industry in
the U.S. territory, an official said Friday [4 Jan 2008].
Puerto Rico halted all bird imports Thursday [3 Jan 2008] after a
rare outbreak of avian flu in the nearby Dominican Republic, where
authorities killed more than 100 chickens, including fighting
roosters that tested positive for the lethal virus.
The cancellation of the fights could cost the industry millions of
dollars in lost revenue from people who come to watch or who enter
their birds to compete, said Carlos Quinones, the cockfighting
director for the island's sports and recreation department.
''The matches were already organized, and people had already
requested their visas and made hotel reservations,'' said Quinones,
who added that fights involving foreign roosters can draw as many as
900 people.
Cockfighting has been outlawed in 49 U.S. states, and Louisiana --
the pastime's last refuge on the U.S. mainland -- has approved
legislation to make it a crime beginning in August 2008. But in
Puerto Rico, the sport is still legal and remains big business.
The island has more than 100 licensed cockfighting pits where
roosters peck and kick each other with plastic spurs. About 200 000
fights are held each year, with annual ticket sales of up to USD 12
million, Quinones said.
The ban could be lifted within as little as one week if Dominican
health officials do not report further outbreaks, said Agriculture
Minister Gabriel Figueroa. For now, it applies to birds from all
countries because it is possible the Dominican birds came from
elsewhere, he said.
The strain of the virus detected in the Dominican Republic, H5N2, is
not a danger to people.

[As stated in the report above, the H5 and H7 strains, even if they
are low pathogenic, must be reported to the OIE because of the
potential for these strains to become highly pathogenic. The reports
indicates 2 locations: one in the capital area in the middle southern
part of the country and a 2nd outbreak in La Altagracia in the
eastern part of the country. A map of the location is included in the
OIE/WAHID report referenced above or can be found at
<http://www.maplandia.com/dominican-republic/la-altagracia/>.
The 2nd report on the banning of bird movement from the Dominican
Republic to Puerto Rico and its effect on cockfighting is concerning
both for the animal cruelty involved and also epidemiologically. The
close proximity of birds and the humans who handle the birds in their
attempts to revive a wounded one can result in very close contact
with avian blood and tissues when trying to suture wounds or
administer artificial respiration. This kind of exposure presents
risks, especially if a genetically risky strain of avian influenza
were to be circulating in the fighting cocks. All in all, such a
situation would be unhealthy on multiple levels. - Mod.PC]
