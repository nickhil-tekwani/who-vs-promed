More than 100 people including women and children fell ill with a mysterious fever in Kadambur, a forest hamlet in Sathyamangalam reserve forest in Erode district. According to villagers, they have been suffering from fever and joint pains for the past one month. Meanwhile, the district administration immediately sent a team of doctors to the village to conduct a health check up.

On Wednesday night [6 Aug 2014], more than 60 Sapranahalli villagers caught fever after consuming contaminated water. "A few of them swooned unable to bear the heat. All the affected were rushed to Sathyamangalam government hospital and other private hospitals for treatment," said Vijaya Kumar, president of 'Tribal People Association'. He also said that another 40 people have become sick with fever since then.

When the district administration became aware of the situation, they asked officials from the health department to rush to the village, last week. "Many of the water tanks in the village look dirty and they are filled with moss. This may have something to do with their illness," said a senior doctor, who was part of the visiting team. He also said that at present the doctors are camping at the village and they are monitoring the situation. "As of now, the situation is under control," he said.

Erode district deputy director of health services, Dr P Balusamy wrote a letter to Ayyavu, president of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam, who had notified the administration about the fever. He stated in his letter that the sick villagers have been diagnosed with chikungunya [virus infection]. They have been prescribed antibiotics and the doctors are closely monitoring the situation.

[This report has some confusing elements. Consumption of contaminated water is attributed to the occurrence of the disease observed. Later, a diagnosis of chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infection was made, but it is not clear if the diagnosis was based on laboratory results or on clinical signs. Although no comment was made on the presence or absence of CHIKV mosquito vectors, the water storage tanks could certainly have been breeding sites for _Aedes_ mosquitoes. Administration of antibiotics will not prove to be an effective treatment for this virus disease.

The American Samoan Department of Health says there are now more than 300 confirmed cases of chikungunya or 'chik' virus in the territory.

The Health Director Motusa Tuileama Nua says his department and LBJ hospital have confirmed the outbreak of fever, rashes, and joint pains among people on the main island of Tutuila is due to chikungunya.

He says there have been 343 recorded cases, with 6 patients hospitalised and no deaths, since the beginning of July [2014].

[CHIKV has been circulating in Pacific islands this year (2014).

American Samoa: confirmed

The American Samoa Department of Health and the LBJ hospital have created a 24 hour a day hotline for the CHIK virus. The CHIK hotline number is 731-7511.

The Health Alert issued yesterday [7 Aug 2014] confirms chikungunya (CHIK) virus as the cause of fever, rash, and joint pains outbreak on Tutuila and there have been more than 390 recorded cases, with 7 patients hospitalized and no deaths since 1 Jul 2014.

According to the health alert, there is no cure for CHIK virus [infection, and] it can usually be treated at home by drinking lots of fluids, taking pain medicine like Tylenol, ibuprofen, or Aleve as needed but only as much and with cautions as recommended on the package.

The health alert urges not to work while your joints are painful, let them rest and apply ice or cold packs on the joints and this may protect against prolonged joint pain.

DOH notes you should go to the Emergency Room to see a doctor if symptoms persist more than 10 days, or if you have bleeding from any part of the body or bruised skin. Call the hotline "or come to the ER or clinic if you are worried about your condition getting worse."

The alert once again urges that people stay indoors in air-con, behind screens, or under bed nets while you are ill, because if you are bitten by mosquitoes while you are ill, you can spread the disease to your family and neighbors.

For travelers, the DOH urges those who are ill not to travel off island, including to Manu'a. "If you travel and become ill when you arrive, tell the doctor who sees you that you may have been exposed to the CHIK virus."

[Interestingly, the 5 Aug 2014 report above indicated that there were 343 reported cases, and in the subsequent report of 8 Aug 2014 above, that number has increased to 390 cases, indicating that transmission of CHIK virus is continuing. - Mod.TY]

Samoa's Ministry of Health has reported 2 deaths from acute fever and rash, saying it is now an outbreak. A press statement from the Director General, Leausa Toleafoa Dr Take Naseri, says there have been 21 recorded cases as of earlier this week with 4 people hospitalised.

The cases are suspected to be chikungunya virus, similar to dengue fever, but results are yet to be confirmed and 3 children and one man have been admitted to the intensive care unit.

The ministry says collaboration with other government agencies, and media campaigns, aim to raise awareness of the outbreak and help its containment.

Samoa has also sought assistance from the Ministry of Health's development partners including the Secretariat of the Pacific Community and the World Health Organisation.

In neighbouring American Samoa, there have been more than 300 confirmed cases of chikungunya.

[This is the 1st ever ProMED-mail report of a chikungunya outbreak in Samoa. Concerning the current outbreak, it would be unusual to have 2 deaths from chikungunya virus infections of a total of 21 recorded cases. One explanation for the high proportion of fatal cases could be significant underreporting of non-fatal cases. No mention is made indicating that there were contributory underlying medical conditions in these 2 fatal cases. ProMED-mail will be interested in receiving results of the laboratory tests when they become available.
