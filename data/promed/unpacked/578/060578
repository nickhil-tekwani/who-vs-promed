A woman in her 80s died in November 2017 after being infected with the hepatitis E virus [HEV] through a blood transfusion at a Japanese facility in what is believed to be the world's 1st fatal case of this type, according to a report by the Japanese Red Cross Society. The organization reported to a government panel on Wed 31 Jan 2018 that the person who donated the blood may have been infected with the virus after eating raw deer meat. The same type of virus was found in the donor's blood and the woman who died. No one else received the infected blood.

The hepatitis E virus can be found in deer and wild boar meat. Pregnant women and elderly people may suffer severe symptoms from the virus [although the genotypes associated with severe infection in pregnancy are not those that are zoonotic. - Mod.LL].

The elderly woman, who was receiving treatment for multiple myeloma, received the blood transfusion in July 2017. Her liver functions deteriorated in October 2017, and she stopped receiving anti-cancer agents. Her condition then improved temporarily, and her cancer treatment resumed before she worsened again prior to her death.

The woman already had weakened liver functions caused by cancer treatment, leading her to develop fulminant hepatitis after being infected, the organization said.

[There are currently 7 genotypes of HEV, and genotypes 1 and 2 are not zoonotic and cause most of the HEV infections in Africa and Asia. It is these genotypes that cause increased morbidity and mortality in pregnant women. Most of the zoonotic hepatitis E cases have been recognized in the developed world, are associated with foodborne disease (usually undercooked pork products), and are caused by genotype 3. In addition, infection with genotype 3 when occurring in immunocompromised hosts (especially solid organ transplant recipients) can cause chronic infection which can progress to cirrhosis. Ribavirin has been used to treat such individuals with chronic infection. - Mod.LL
