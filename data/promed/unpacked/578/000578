level, probable cases are reported by all countries except the United
States of America, which is reporting suspected cases under investigation.
2. National public health authorities report to WHO on the areas in which
local chain(s) of transmission is/are occurring. These areas are provided
on the list of Affected Areas.
3. One death attributed to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China
occurred in a case medically transferred from Viet Nam.

[D] SARS epidemiology to date 11 April 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/epi2003_04_11/en/>
- SARS is a new disease which has its origins in Guangdong Province, China.
The earliest known cases were identified in mid-Nov 2002. Since then,
probable cases of SARS have been reported in 17 countries.
- WHO is constantly investigating and, where appropriate, verifying rumours
about SARS coming in from a wide range of sources.
- The current cumulative number of cases of SARS is 2781 cases with 111
deaths, officially notified by ministries of health. - - The global
case-fatality rate for probable SARS is 4 percent.
- Most SARS cases to date have occurred in young adults. This transmission
pattern largely reflects the age of health care workers, their family
members and social contacts, and international travellers. On the basis of
present data, children appear to be less likely to present with SARS than
adults.
- SARS appears to be spread most commonly by close person-to-person contact
involving exposure to infectious droplets, and possibly by direct contact
with infected body fluids.
- China continues to see new cases of SARS although the numbers are
decreasing following a peak in cases in February 2003. To date, 1290 cases
and 55 deaths have been reported from mainland China.
- Hong Kong is experiencing the second largest outbreak of SARS with 998
cases and 30 deaths. A significant outbreak at the Amoy Gardens apartment
block between 27 Mar 2003 to 1 Apr 2003 resulted in a peak in cases.
Stringent public health measures appear to have controlled the Amoy Gardens
outbreak. However, cases continue to be reported in health care workers,
and Hong Kong health authorities are strengthening their infection control
and community-based public health measures accordingly.
- Canada has experienced an outbreak of 97 probable SARS cases and 10
deaths. Up to now, the outbreak has been largely confined to Toronto. All
cases have been epidemiologically linked to transmission related to a
health care setting and transmission among close contacts of known SARS
cases. In the Canadian outbreak, the higher case-fatality ratio appears to
be linked to the older age of the patients, who frequently have underlying
chronic disease.
- Infection control and other public health measures implemented in Viet
Nam have effectively controlled the outbreak in Hanoi. Very low levels of
transmission have been reported after 24 Mar 2003. Since the outbreak began
on 26 Feb 2003, 4 deaths have been reported.
- Although Singapore continues to see new cases, including clusters in
hospital staff, inpatients, and visitors at 2 hospitals, the daily increase
in numbers has decreased since a peak in mid-March 2003. As of 10 Apr 2003,
a cumulative total of 126 cases with 9 deaths has been reported. Singapore
is currently investigating a new cluster at the Singapore General Hospital
affecting 52 persons in Wards 57 and 58, comprising 19 probable and 33
suspect SARS cases. The index case was admitted to this hospital on 24 Mar
2003 for the management of unrelated chronic illness, did not show
characteristic SARS symptoms initially, and therefore was not placed in
isolation and managed according to the principles of strict infection control.
- Cases continue to increase in the United States with 154 persons under
investigation. US figures include probable and suspect cases. The US now
reports limited transmission from patients to health care workers. No
deaths have so far been reported from the US.
- Areas defined as "affected" are updated each day according to the latest
data on cases and evidence of patterns of transmission. Epidemiological
data indicate that SARS cases occurring in all other countries became
infected while present in one of the affected areas or by direct contact
with known cases of SARS.
An epidemic curve of worldwide reporting by dates of onset can be found at:
<http://www.who.int/csr/sarsepicurve/epiindex/en/index1.html>.

[E] Information to Member States regarding goods and animals arriving from
SARS-affected areas 11 Apr 2003
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/goods2003_04_10/en/>
WHO is aware of concern over the possibility that SARS may be caused by
contact with animals. WHO is therefore working closely with the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Office
International des Epizooties (OIE), to determine whether there is any
evidence to suggest that SARS-related disease has occurred in animals.
WHO, FAO and OIE have reviewed reports received regarding SARS
transmission. To date there is no epidemiological information to suggest
that contact with goods, products, or animals shipped from SARS-affected
areas has been the source of SARS infection in humans.
For the above reasons, WHO does not at present conclude that any goods,
products, or animals arriving from SARS-affected areas pose a risk to
public health. WHO will continue to closely monitor the evolution of SARS,
in collaboration with Ministries of Health and our partner agencies.

Situation report on atypical pneumonia 11 Apr 2003
The following is jointly issued by the Department of Health and the
Hospital Authority:
As of 1 PM 11 Apr 2003, an additional 61 patients with symptoms of atypical
pneumonia were admitted to public hospitals. They include 11 healthcare
workers (5 from Princess Margaret Hospital, 2 from Alice Ho Miu Ling
Nethersole Hospital, one from North District Hospital, and one from Hong
Kong Baptist Hospital) and 11 patients from Amoy Gardens. The remaining 39
were new patients and contacts of patients with atypical pneumonia.
A total of 169 patients have recovered from atypical pneumonia and have
been discharged from public hospitals. Of them, 15 were discharged
today. Most of the patients currently in hospital are showing positive
responses to the new treatment protocol. 121 patients are receiving
treatment in intensive care unit.
2 patients died in hospitals, bring to 32 the total number of deaths
related to atypical pneumonia. A 81-year-old male with a history of chronic
disease died in Prince of Wales Hospital last night and a 79-year-old male
patient died in United Christian Hospital this morning.
The cumulative figure for patients who have been admitted to public
hospitals with atypical pneumonia since 12 Mar 2003 is as follows:
Cumulative no. cases/ total no. discharged/ total no. deaths
(all reported cases had signs of pneumonia)
Health care workers of Hospitals/Clinics and medical students: 264/ 78 32
Patients, family members & visitors: 795/ 91
Total: 1059/ 169
* Most of the deaths occurred in individuals who have a history of
chronic diseases, or were patients who sought treatment at a relatively
late stage of infection.

Taiwan SARS Updated on 11 Apr 2003
1. As of 15:00 PM on 11 Apr 2003, there were 147 possible SARS cases
reported. They include 23 probable, 37 suspected, 72 excluded, and 15
pending cases. In accordance with WHO guidelines, 7 of the probable and 15
of the suspected cases were discharged to home quarantine while the other
16 probable and 22 suspected cases are still being cared for in negative
pressure rooms. A total of 60 possible SARS cases have been discharged from
hospitals.
2. As of 11 Apr 2003, local health stations distributed SARS home
quarantine notifications to 1458 persons who had close contact with
probable SARS cases. 988 of them have been relieved of the quarantine order.
3. Since SARS is a new emerging infectious disease and its cause agent has
not been confirmed, a probable case is identified based on epidemiologic
data, clinical data, laboratory diagnosis data, and further serology is
needed to confirm the diagnosis. Taiwan SARS Advisory Committee did not
recommend the early release of the results of coronavirus test by RT-PCR to
the local health authorities for their reference. Taiwan CDC advises the
local health authorities to take precautionary measures as soon as they
receive a reported SARS case, without laboratory diagnosis.

As of 11 Apr 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 266 probable or
suspect cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Canada. There
have been 10 deaths in Canada. All Canadian cases have occurred in persons
who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS cases in the household
or in a health-care setting. The information contained in this update is
based on the best available information Health Canada has at this time.
The details of the cases to date are as follows:
Ontario is reporting 98 probable and 119 suspect cases. All cases have
occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact with SARS
cases in the household or in a health-care setting.
British Columbia is reporting 3 probable and 34 suspect cases.
New Brunswick is reporting 2 suspect cases.
Saskatchewan is reporting 1 suspect case.
Alberta is reporting 5 suspect cases.
Prince Edward Island is reporting 4 suspect cases.
So far, 54 people have been discharged from hospitals in Ontario. These
people were treated as suspect cases or as probable cases.
These numbers are accurate as of 1:00 PM EDST, 11 Apr 2003.
Protecting Canada's Blood Supply
Health Canada issued formal direction to blood operators on 10 Apr 2003, as
a precaution to protect the blood supply in Canada and recipients from the
possible threat of SARS. Although there is currently no evidence of
transmission of SARS through blood and blood components, Health Canada has
directed blood operators to temporarily defer from [accepting] blood (for a
period of 10 days) from persons who have:
- traveled within the previous 10 days to an affected area outside Canada.
The affected areas are currently: China, including the Hong Kong SAR;
Hanoi, Vietnam; Singapore and Taiwan;
- been a patient, worked in, or visited a facility that is under quarantine
for SARS.
Health Canada has requested that provincial public health officials, when
investigating possible SARS cases, ask whether the individual has donated
blood. If the individual has donated blood within 10 days prior to the
first day of symptoms such as fever, public health officials are asked to
notify Canadian Blood Services and Hema-Quebec. The donor's blood and blood
products will be withdrawn from the inventory.

[A] Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysian cruise ship crew from the
Washington Post:
<http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A9859-2003Apr11.html>
Indonesia and the Philippines reported their first cases of severe acute
respiratory syndrome, bringing to 20 the number of nations that have
reported SARS cases.
A Malaysian cruise ship, the Superstar Virgo, was also hit with SARS. One
crew member is ill and another is showing symptoms, a Star Cruises
spokeswoman said Friday. They have been admitted to hospitals in Singapore
and Malaysia.
[B] China, Beijing from The Daily Telegraph

[There have been 109 new cases of SARS reported to WHO since the last
update on 10 Apr 2003, for a cumulative total case count of 2890. Among
these there have been 116 deaths (case fatality rate 4 percent) and 1373
have recovered (47.5 percent). The largest increase was in Hong Kong, with
61 new cases since the last update on 10 Apr 2003. The Taiwan Center for
Disease Control has reported 2 more probable cases in their update for
today than are included in the WHO daily update.
China reported 19 new cases since the last update on 10 Apr 2003. The
newswires have carried multiple reports suggesting underreporting of cases
from China. In the briefs section above [5], there are reports of 22 cases
currently being treated in Beijing according to official sources, whereas
in Shanghai there are reports of 9 non-Chinese nationals currently being
treated for SARS. In a press briefing held at WHO today, the last remark
of Dr. Heymann with respect to the outbreak in China was "And our team
thinks that there is disease in most provinces." We await further
information from the investigations of the WHO teams in China.
<http://www.who.int/csr/sars/Press_2003_04_11/en/>
In the Health Canada update [4], the addition of guidelines for blood banks
and securing the blood supply on the chance that SARS infections may be
associated with significant viremia and thereby transmissible via blood
transfusions is the first official announcement addressing this issue that
we have come across. After the experience in the USA during 2002 with
transmission of West Nile virus infections via blood transfusions, this is
a prudent public health measure until such time that significant viremia
has been ruled out.
Of interest is a new website on SARS developed by the Ministry of Health of
Singapore:
<http://app.moh.gov.sg/sar/sar01.asp>
The European Union, the United States, and Singapore did not post updates
on their respective SARS websites today (as of 9 PM EDST). We await further
word on whether there has been local transmission of SARS in the United
States (in yesterday's update there was information on a suspected contact
case in a work colleague). - Mod.MPP]
