Cucumber Green Mottle Mosaic virus found in West Australia
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[Cucumber Green Mottle Mosaic Virus], a potentially devastating plant virus able to infect a number of horticultural crops, has been detected for the first time in Western Australia [WA], in a cucumber crop near Geraldton. In 2014 the virus was first found in Australia in watermelon crops in the Northern Territory [ProMED-mail post 20141009.2844854].

Department of Agriculture and Food WA's [DAFWA] John van Schagen said [they] would investigate the source, however the obvious pathway was from infected seed. "It's definitely on the one property, possibly a 2nd one and maybe even more, we don't know at this stage," he said. "We diagnosed it from cucumber leaves. It's got potential to be fairly serious."

Local cucumber growers are worried about the virus and paying close attention to farm hygiene.

[_Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus_ (CGMMV; genus _Tobamovirus_) is a major pathogen of cucurbit crops with reported yield losses of around 15 per cent. The virus has a narrow host range. Many strains, including the type strain occurring in Europe, are limited to Cucurbitaceae, but some isolates have been reported which can also affect a number of species in other families, including Amaranthaceae and Solanaceae. Symptoms vary in different host species and may be masked in field crops. They may include severe leaf mosaic, deformation of vines, and internal fruit symptoms such as discolouration and rotting of flesh.

CGMMV is both seed and pollen transmitted. It is extremely stable and can also be spread by mechanical means (human activities, insect damage, plant-to-plant contact), with contaminated agricultural tools, infected plant material, contaminated soil and in water. Spread by specific insect vectors appears doubtful. Disease management may include removal of virus reservoirs, phytosanitary practices and use of certified clean seed or other planting material. Transgenic rootstock lines of some cucurbit crops (such as watermelon) with resistance to CGMMV have been or are being developed.

In Australia, until now CGMMV had been detected in Northern Territory (NT) and Queensland. It was reported in cucurbit crops (including watermelon, pumpkin), cucurbit seedlings (for example, cucumber) and a number of weed hosts (see previous ProMED-mail posts listed below). Initially, it was suggested that the virus may have entered the country with infected watermelon seed from overseas. However, its presence in multiple hosts would now suggest that the virus may have been present in the country before its 1st official confirmation (ProMED-mail post 20141009.2844854). Wild cucurbits, which are common in central Australia, may have provided a virus reservoir. Alternatively, different strains may be present in crops and weeds, in which case the strain(s) affecting the crops may have been introduced on seeds. To clarify these questions, strains from the different hosts need to be characterised. Evidence suggests that local spread occurs (see ProMED-mail post 20160123.3958997).

Nevertheless, in NT CGMMV quarantine was lifted (see links below) making farmers responsible for any re-emergence of the virus on their property. Not surprisingly, this approach has caused controversy amongst stakeholders and hopefully may be re-evaluated in the light of the report above. Identifying the source of the WA infections will be vital for limiting further spread of the virus in the country.
