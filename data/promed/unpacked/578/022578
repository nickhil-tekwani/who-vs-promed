1st record of a Hop stunt viroid variant on Nagpur mandarin and
Mosambi sweet orange trees on rough lemon and Rangpur lime rootstocks
P. Ramachandran <viroidram@yahoo.co.in>, Plant Virology Unit,
Division of Plant Pathology, Indian Agricultural Research Institute,
New Delhi - 110012, India; J. Agarwal (as for Ramachandran); A. Roy,
Plant virus Lab., Division of Crop Protection, Central Research
Institute for Jute and Allied Fibres, Barrackpore, Kolkata - 700 120,
India; D. K. Ghosh, NRC for Citrus, Nagpur, India; D. R. Das (as for
Ramachandran); and Y.S. Ahlawat (as for Ramachandran). Accepted for
publication 22 Dec 2004.
Citrus rootstocks play a very significant role in tree health and
productivity. Sub-viral pathogens, viroids pose a major threat to
trees and susceptible rootstocks as they bring about slow decline
(Ahlawat, 1997). In a survey of citrus orchards in certain parts of
Central India, symptoms of bark scaling, bark splitting and leaf
yellowing were observed on Nagpur mandarin (_C. reticulata_) (7
plants) and mosambi (_C. sinensis_) (10 plants) grafted on rough
lemon and Rangpur lime rootstocks.
Following grafting of scions from all these plants onto Etrog Citron
(_C. medica_), an indicator host for Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd),
an unusual symptom of reduced size and yellowing of newly emerging
leaves developed. This prompted further investigation.
Electrophoresis under denaturing conditions of total nucleic acid,
extracted from the grafted Etrog citron plants with symptoms,
indicated the presence of viroid-like low molecular weight (LMW) RNA
in all the samples. These LMW-RNAs were used in RT-PCR using a set of
citrus viroid-specific primers (Ramachandran et al., 2003).
Amplicons of approx. 300 bp were obtained in all the samples with
primers specific to Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), while no amplification
was observed with CEVd-specific primers. Cloning and sequencing of
these amplicons identified a viroid RNA (Acc. No. Y237168) with 100
percent sequence similarity to HSVd-Ca905 (Acc. No. AF131250;
Reanwarakorn & Semancik, 1999) and HSVd-ycv (Acc. No. AJ490824; Roy &
Ramachandran, 2003).
This constitutes the 1st isolation of a HSVd isolate (HSVd-RL) from
citrus rootstocks showing bark scaling and splitting symptoms in
Central India. This result suggests that HSVd is also a component in
producing bark-scaling symptoms in rootstocks, which were previously
considered to be due to CEVd infection alone.
This report indicates the need for the testing of citrus plants for
HSVd in budwood certification and germplasm evaluation.

[Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) belongs to the genus _Hostuviroid_ in the
family _Pospiviroidae_. It has been found latent in a wide range of
herbaceous and woody hosts (grapevine, apricot, pear) and may induce
peculiar symptoms such as hop stunt, dapple fruit of plum and peach,
and citrus cachexia. Citrus cachexia viroid is a graft-transmissible
viroid that causes phloem deterioration and blockage in many
mandarin, mandarin hybrids, _Citrus macrophylla_ Wester, Rangpur
lime, and sweet lime. This disease causes decline, stunting, and crop
reduction. Sour orange is tolerant to the viroid.
HSVd isolates have been assigned to 5 phylogenetic groups according
to sequence variants: plum-type, hop-type, citrus-type (main groups),
plum-citrus-type and plum-hop-citrus-type (recombinant groups).
Transmission of grapevine yellow speckle viroid 1 and hop stunt
viroid via seeds has been confirmed in 11 seedlings of 8 grapevine
_Vitis vinifera_ varieties using a combination of RT-PCR, dot-blot
hybridization and northern hybridization assays. This indicates that
budwood stocks must be checked for the presence of HSVd. At least 16
new sequence variants of HSVd have been obtained from 4 Mediterranean
countries (Cyprus, Greece, Morocco and Turkey) where this viroid had
not previously been described.
