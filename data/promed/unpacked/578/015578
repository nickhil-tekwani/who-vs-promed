There has been a significant increase in syphilis cases as the Northwest Territories continues to deal with an outbreak declared in 2019. There have been 37 cases of syphilis reported since [1 Jan 2021] with the majority of them (78 per cent) in Yellowknife.

These new cases represent a significant rate increase, dramatically exceeding that seen in 2019, said a Tuesday [3 Aug 2021] news release from the Office of the chief public health officer, Dr Kami Kandola. Adults between ages 20 and 60 are experiencing high rates of infection, the release said, with those aged 30 to 39 most impacted.

Northwest Territories residents can lower their risk of getting syphilis by having healthy sexual relationships, using condoms during vaginal, anal, and oral sex, and getting tested if they are in a new sexual relationship or have any concerns. Since 2019, 2 mothers have passed the syphilis infection to a developing newborn during pregnancy, resulting in congenital syphilis, which can cause serious health issues including stillbirth, neonatal death, or severe chronic health conditions.

In response to the outbreak, the release says the following actions are being taken:
- A dedicated phone in Yellowknife that provides confidential advice -- call or text 867-446-5113.
- Rapid access to syphilis and other sexually transmitted infection testing in Yellowknife.
- Enhanced syphilis testing for pregnant people.
- Expanded walk-in clinic hours.
- Cross-training more frontline staff to assist with patient assessments and follow-up.
- Targeted social marketing and ads.

[Yellowknife, with a population of about 20 000 residents, on the northern shore of Great Slave Lake, about 400 km (250 mi) south of the Arctic Circle, is the capital and only city, in the Northwest Territories (NWT), Canada (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowknife). The city is located in the traditional territory of the Yellowknives Dene First Nation and almost 25% of the population identify as Indigenous.

The syphilis outbreak started in the NWT in 2019, but is now up by about 50 per cent from 2019. We are not told in the news report above characteristics of the affected population, except almost 80% of cases live in Yellowknife and mainly 30 to 39 year olds are affected. A news report last year, however, said that in 2020 50 per cent of cases in the NWT were male and 50 per cent female (https://cabinradio.ca/41773/news/health/syphilis-outbreak-still-a-concern-in-the-nwt/). It is reported that 20 per cent of the cases in the NWT are homeless (https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/syphilis-outbreak-nwt-underhoused-population-1.6129306). It is important to know the characteristics of the affected population so that preventive and therapeutic measures can be appropriately targeted.

In 2019 ProMED reported on an outbreak of primary and secondary syphilis in the neighboring Canadian province of Saskatchewan that affected in part Indigenous young people and illicit drug use, namely methamphetamine, was cited as a contributing factor. More information from knowledgeable sources on the current syphilis outbreak in the NWT would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
