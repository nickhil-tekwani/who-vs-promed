Quarantine authorities in China are on alert after white spot disease was confirmed in a batch of shrimp seized from luggage taken from a returning tourist at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai.

Inspections of tourist luggage and of packages will be stepped up after laboratory tests on the seized shrimp -- which originated in the Philippines -- showed the disease, according to a statement from China's national quarantine body.

The statement was accompanied by a photo of the seizure, which included shrimp, crabs, and a red-orange colored fish species which is not identified. It's not clear if the seafood was brought in by an unwitting tourist or one of the many travelers seeking to profit from sales of merchandise purchased overseas and undeclared at customs.

China has over the past year focused on this phenomenon of 'daigou' (literally translated as 'bring shoppers') who have been targeted for evading customs duties. Several infestations of white spot disease caused serious damage to Chinese shrimp farms in recent years, making detection of the virus a priority for the country's authorities.

[White spot viral disease has caused high mortalities and severe damage to the shrimp culture industry in China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and India. The virus was first detected in Taiwan in 1992, and then it spread to Japan and almost all Asian countries.

Acutely affected shrimp are reported to show a rapid reduction in food consumption, become lethargic, and have a loose cuticle with white spots (hence, the name "white spot" disease) of 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, which are more apparent on the inside surface of the carapace (see http://tinyurl.com/yccnan4r). The white spots represent abnormal deposits of calcium salts by the cuticular epidermis.
