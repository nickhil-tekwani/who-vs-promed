Four die of mysterious disease
----------------------
Four persons have died last week [week of 17 Mar 2008] at the
Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital due to an unidentified disease, doctors said.

Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) of the Anuradhapura hospital Dr. Ajith
Jayasena told the Daily Mirror that investigations are underway by
the hospital authorities to ascertain whether this was an infectious
viral disease

Three males and a female from Welioya, Maradankadawala and Galnewa
have died on 3 successive days last week at the hospital and the JMO
has cited the malfunctioning of several organic systems of the
patients as the cause of death.

Some soldiers were admitted to the hospital last week and doctors
suspect that the same virus had attacked them.

Tissue specimens extracted from lungs and hearts of the dead persons
are to be examined to ascertain the nature of the disease, Dr. Jayasena said.

[The Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital is the main hospital in the North
Central region and the 3rd largest hospital in Sri Lanka. Over 1.3
million people reside in the Anuradhapura District and the adjoining
districts of Vavuniya, Mannar, Trincomalee and Puttalam where
healthcare facilities are comparatively poor.
(<http://www.news.lk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5123&Itemid=44>)

The above newswire does not provide sufficient clinical details for
this moderator to venture speculations as to the possible etiology of
these fatal cases. While there is mention that there is multiple
organ failure, the newswire does mention that hearts and lungs are
being examined. There is also mention that soldiers have been
admitted with similar illness but non-fatal.

Of note, in 2005, ProMED-mail had a series of postings on an
undiagnosed cardiomyopathy/myocarditis in Badulla and Monaragala
districts, Uva province of Sri Lanka. (see prior postings referenced
below). A review of the literature reveals that the etiology of that
outbreak was dengue fever with cardiac manifestations. (see
Kularatnea SAM, Pathiragea MMK, Kumarasirib PVR, Gunasenac
S, Mahindawansea SI. Cardiac complications of a dengue fever
outbreak in Sri Lanka, 2005. Trans. Royal Soc Trop Med
Hygiene. August 2007. 101(8):804-808. abstract available at:
<http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B75GP-4NFXGCH-3&_user=10&_rdoc=1&_fmt=&_orig=search&_sort=d&view=c&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=69091cb721989874be3513fcea69f938>).
One can't help but wonder if the deaths and non-fatal cases mentioned
in the above newswire might be a repeat of the 2005 experience with
dengue fever.

More information on the above mentioned outbreak with details on the
epidemiologic investigations as well as pathology findings would be
greatly appreciated.
