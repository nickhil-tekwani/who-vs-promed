Nearly 300 people have died in a cholera epidemic in West Africa, and
thousands of others have been infected. Outbreaks this year [2007]
have left more than 250 dead in Guinea and 30 dead in Sierra Leone.

In Senegal, more than 2000 cases of cholera have been reported, says
Red Cross Health Manager for West and Central Africa, Aissa Fall
Gueye. This is a very high infection rate, she says, but not
exceptional for the West African country. Only 12 cases have been
fatal. She says Senegal has done a good job of responding to this
year's [2007] crisis. But she says the disease will continue to
plague the region if international donors and governments do not
shift their focus from disaster relief to long-term prevention.

It can also pass from person to person, which becomes a serious
problem as people move around the country. For example, in Senegal,
this year's [2007] first major outbreak was reported in Touba, after
rains caused the sewers to overflow. One week later, there was an
outbreak hundreds of kilometers away in Saint Louis, after a
religious gathering that was attended by many from Touba.

Gueye says health organizations and ministries need to stop acting
like firefighters, who wait to respond until the situation is already
in crisis. She says they need to be more proactive and they need
donor support to help them focus more strongly on prevention.

But community level action is not enough, says Belgium's Doctors
Without Borders West Africa Operational Coordinator, Sebastien Roy.
"The biggest increase of cases is probably linked to structural
reasons. Bad sanitation conditions, problems with the water supply
for the population, and with wide urbanization of the city," he noted.

In 2005, more than 1200 died in a massive outbreak that infected more
than 75 000 across West Africa.

A cholera outbreak in Mozambique's central province of Zambezia
reported this week has resulted in the death of 2 people and the
hospitalisation of another 6.

Radio Mozambique reported on Thu 25 Oct 2007 that the outbreak in the
rural district of Morrumbala near the Malawian border was due to the
consumption of contaminated water. The station said out of the 29
cases reported in that province this week, 6 people who remained in
hospital were in a stable condition.

Cholera outbreaks are often reported in Mozambique's rural and urban
centres during the rainy season, which began this month [October 2007].

The latest clashes in the Democratic Republic of Congo have driven 33
000 more people from villages in Nord-Kivu province and a cholera
outbreak is suspected, UN agencies reported on Wed 24 Oct 2007. About
25 000 people have been uprooted in the rugged Rutshuru highlands
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of the provincial capital Goma
and 8000 others have fled over the border into Uganda, UN officials estimated.

At Bunagana, a settlement on the border, officials had noted 2 cases
of suspected cholera, a fast-spreading water-borne disease, leading
the UN HCR [UN High Commissioner for Refugees - Mod.LL] to urge
people to move out of the zone to the "transit center with adequate
health facilities." HCR workers and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF -
Doctors without Borders) at Nyankabanda have finished building "7
collective shelters for 1500 people." MSF staff were vaccinating
children under 5 and the UN Children's Fund provided 2 10 000-liter
fresh water tanks.

Eradicated from Nepal 10 years ago, cholera [broke out] in Nepal
again, the Nepali national news agency RSS reported on Thursday 25 Oct 2007].

In Saptari district, some 190 km (118 miles) southeast of the capital
Kathmandu, cholera was found when it was sought to identify the cause
of outbreak of diarrhea that has been spreading in the district, an
epidemic scale for the past 6 weeks.

The bacterium of cholera was found after research was carried out by
a microbiological team. The team led by Dr. Rajendra Gurung of BP
Koirala Health Science Academy found cholera in 4 villages of Saptari
district, said District Public Health Office of Saptari. The
bacterium was found in the human excreta of diarrhea patients as well
as the water consumed by the patients.

So far, diarrhea that spread in the form of cholera has claimed 19
persons while 50 have been affected by disease. Most of them are
children [in this district or nation-wide. - Mod.LL]

Although most of the postings from Nepal just report on diarrhea with
fatalities, some previous posts have mentioned cholera in 2007 as
well as yearly since 2004. Just how much of the diarrhea or dysentery
reported from Nepal is cholera is unclear. - Mod.LL]
