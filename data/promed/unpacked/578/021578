["Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal hepatitis of Leporids, caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_). Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to one of the previously identified 6 genotypes (G1-G6), among which the G6 is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV, emerged in Europe and was called RHDV2. Another lagovirus, called the European brown hare syndrome virus (EBHSV), causes a similar disease in hares (_Lepus europaeus_, _L. timidus_, and _L. corsicanus_).

"RHD is characterised by high morbidity and a mortality of up to 90%. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. Transmission follows contact with infected rabbits or via indirect contact with mechanical vectors (including insects, birds, and humans) or contaminated tools and equipment. The incubation period of RHD varies from 1-3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of the acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy, and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4-6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 7-15 days of age onwards."

"As of 2020, RHDV2 has become established in wild lagomorphs in a number of European countries, Australia, and parts of Africa. In some locations, RHDV2 has largely replaced classical RHDV or RHDVa. Outbreaks have also been reported in New Zealand and some countries in the Middle East, Asia, and North America, but whether the virus will persist in some of these locations is not yet certain. In North America, this virus was found in both domestic and feral rabbits."

"There is no indication that any lagoviruses infect humans."
