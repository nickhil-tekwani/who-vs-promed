State health officials have discovered a new strain of a contagious bacterial infection in the investigation of an illness outbreak linked to the Cleveland County Fair, according to the county health department director.

Officials confirmed Thursday (18 Oct 2012) that 8 patients with _E. coli_ O157 share a similar, unknown strain of the infection, said county health director Dorothea Wyant. "This strain has never been identified before," Wyant said. "It doesn't have a name."

As of Wed 17 Oct 2012, 81 people showed symptoms of _E. coli_ throughout the state and South Carolina, with 48 of the cases involving Cleveland County residents. Health officials said all attended the Cleveland County Fair. The Division of Public Health of the NC Department of Health and Human Services said 52 children and 29 adults have _E. coli_ symptoms. The state confirmed 22 of the patients have _E. coli_. A 2-year-old from Gaston County died from complications of the illness.

State officials have toured the Cleveland County Fairgrounds multiple times as case numbers increase. They visited areas where animals were housed at the fair. They took 45 environmental specimens from soil in an effort to pinpoint the source of the outbreak, Wyant said.

Officials also took samples from the racetrack and permanent food booths for testing. After the sample collection, fairgrounds workers sealed off areas where animals were exposed to the public. Workers overturned and disinfected soil throughout fairgrounds, according to Wyant.

"The state is hoping to find an _E. coli_ strain that matches the 8 people," she said.

_E. coli_ patient questionnaire results show more infected residents visited animals than ate fair food. "We learned people who got sick and their family members ate the same food. Some family members didn't get sick," Wyant said. "We couldn't find a commonality in the foods."

"We've gotten calls today from people saying they got sick yesterday," Wyant said. "The number is likely to increase." Wyant urged people to thoroughly wash their hands in an effort to keep secondary-contract cases at a minimum. So far, Wyant knows of one county woman caregiver who contracted the infection from an infant.

The state expects possible reports of secondary cases for another several weeks, according to a press release.

[The number of cases associated with the Cleveland County (NC) State Fair, probably related to one or more petting zoos, has continued to rise.

What is most provocative about this posting is the statement about a presumed 2nd microbe isolated from 8 individuals that "has never been identified before," and "It doesn't have a name." This moderator spoke to Ms. Wyant directly who reported that the information came from a conference call with the State Health Department in Raleigh. This moderator was not able to link up with anyone at the Health Department to clarify the statements. Is this strain not an _E. coli_? We await more information.
