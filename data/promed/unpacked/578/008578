Molecular characterization of a strain of squash leaf curl China virus from
the Philippines
--------------------------
T Kon, S Hase, H Takahashi, M Ikegami (Department of Life Science, Graduate
School of Agricultural Science, Tohoku University, Sendai 981-8555, Japan),
LM Dolores, NB Bajet (University of the Philippines, Los Banos, Philippines)
The complete nucleotide sequence of infectious cloned DNA components (A and
B) of the causal agent of squash leaf curl disease in the Philippines was
determined. DNA-A and DNA-B comprise 2739 and 2705 nucleotides,
respectively; the common region is 174 bases in length.
5 ORFs were found in DNA-A and 2 in DNA-B. Partial dimeric clones
containing DNA-A and DNA-B, constructed in a binary vector and transformed
into _Agrobacterium tumefaciens_, induced systemic infection in
agro-inoculated pumpkin plants (_Cucurbita moschata_).
The total DNA-A sequence was most closely related to that of squash leaf
curl China virus (SLCCNV) (88 per cent identity), although the existence of
B component of SLCCNV has not been reported. The deduced coat protein was
like that of SLCCNV (98 per cent amino acid sequence identity) and the
Philippines virus has low sequence identity to squash leaf curl virus
(SLCV) and squash mild leaf curl virus (SMLCV) (63 and 64 per cent total
nucleotide sequence identities, respectively).
From these results, we propose that the Philippines virus be designated
squash leaf curl China virus-[Philippines] (SLCCNV-[PH]).

[The evolution of the Philippines strain is not unexpected, as new strains
are constantly emerging. In addition to Squash leaf curl Philippines virus,
there are 2 other strains -- SLCV (type strain) and Squash leaf curl China
virus (Yunnan). Squash leaf curl begomovirus (SLCV) is transmitted by 2
whitefly species -- the sweet potato whitefly _Bemisia tabaci_ and the
silverleaf whitefly, _B. argentifolii_ -- although some taxonomists suggest
that these species are really biotypes. Squash and watermelon are preferred
hosts. Disease management utilizes cultural control (eradication of
infected plants, use of UV-absorbing greenhouse plastic films, and aluminum
plastic mulches) and biological control (use of parasitoids such as
_Encarsia_ and _Eretmocerus_ spp). Use of insecticides is not very
efficacious because whiteflies tend to congregate on the undersides of leaves.
