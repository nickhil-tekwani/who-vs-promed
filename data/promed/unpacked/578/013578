A fresh bird flu outbreak has been discovered in Germany, with a state
laboratory confirming the presence of the H5N1 virus, an official
veterinarian said on Thursday [20 Dec 2007]. The infected bird was in a
private hen run at Bensdorf, a village 85 km west of Berlin, said state of
Brandenburg vet Hans-Georg Hurttig. All 30 fowl were immediately killed and
removed.
He said scientists believed it was a spot outbreak only. The case would
only be declared official when a federal laboratory confirmed it. A
Brandenburg spokesman said it was still officially considered a "suspected
case".
A week ago, the avian influenza virus was discovered at Altglobsow, 75 km
north of Berlin, in a hen run with 11 birds.
