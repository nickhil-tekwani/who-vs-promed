Russia: U.S. Report Sheds New Light On Soviet Smallpox Outbreak
---------------------------------------------------------------
Ray Zilinskas of California's Monterey Institute of International Studies
is one of the co-authors of a report on the Aralsk incident presented this
weekend at a Washington seminar on smallpox vaccination policy. "The first
victim was a young woman who was working as a technician on a research
vessel that was doing an investigation on the ecological situation of the
Aral Sea. It was cruising south of Vozrozhdenie Island at the end of July
[1971] and we believe that at that time she was exposed to an aerosol that
was released over Vozrozhdenie Island, which was about 15 km away. When she
returned to her home in Aralsk she came down with symptoms of smallpox. She
passed it on to her 9-year-old brother, who became rather sick, but both of
them survived," Zilinskas said. However, 3 others -- 2 babies, and the
boy's teacher -- didn't. They died of hemorrhagic smallpox, a particularly
virulent form of the disease. In all, 10 people became ill with smallpox.
The 7 who survived, including the researcher and her brother, had received
smallpox vaccinations years earlier, while the 3 who died had not. The town
was closed. Mass vaccinations and quarantines followed.
Smallpox was still occurring naturally in the 1970s, but the Monterey
Institute's researchers say evidence in the Aralsk case points strongly not
to a natural outbreak or lab accident but to the testing of a smallpox
biological weapon on Vozrozhdenie. If the germs were airborne, this means
they were disseminated as an aerosol, and the fact that some of those
struck by the virus had already been vaccinated suggests, though not
necessarily proves, that the smallpox used was of a particularly virulent
strain.
Retired General Petr Burgasov, once a top figure in the Soviet Union's
bioweapons program, admitted in the "Moscow News" paper late last year
[2001] that a smallpox test -- he did not specify a year -- had caused an
unidentified number of civilian deaths. "They were testing a strong strain
of smallpox," Burgasov is quoted as saying in the "Moscow News" interview,
which the Monterrey researchers cite in their report. "Suddenly I'm told
that there are some unexplained deaths in Aralsk. A research boat had gone
within 15 km of the island [it was banned from going closer than 40 km]; a
woman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton
samples. The smallpox agent -- and on the island all of 400 grams of the
strain was used -- 'got' her."
Zilinskas said his team's report is based on previously secret documents
given to them by the Kazakh Scientific Center for Quarantine and Zoonotic
Diseases. It is also based on interviews with 2 survivors, the woman and
her younger brother. He acknowledged the data is patchy, but said the
"airborne germs" theory is the most logical explanation of how the woman
became infected. And he dismissed suggestions by skeptics that it could
have been a natural outbreak that traveled from Afghanistan. "The problem
with that explanation is that there were no other cases in between. In
other words, in Uzbekistan or Turkmenistan or any of these other countries
you'd have to transverse in order to get to Aralsk. And there were no other
outbreaks at that time anywhere else in the neighborhood. So the only good
explanation is that this testing was done on Vozrozhdenie Island,"
Zilinskas said.
Zilinskas said action is needed now to improve existing smallpox vaccine
stocks, in case they are not effective against all smallpox strains. That,
he said, is a long-term process that could take 5 or 10 years.

[Two things are important to note in this version:
- "a woman laboratory technician went twice a day on land to take plankton
samples" -- the first report said she never left the ship, so must have got
it by aerosol from at least 15 km away; so the spread may not have been
that far.
- "there were no other cases in between" Afghanistan & Kazakhstan at that
time -- this can presumably be checked from WHO records, making it very
unlikely it was natural spread. - Mod.JW]
[According to the WHO history of Smallpox Eradication
<http://whqlibdoc.who.int/smallpox/9241561106_chp14.pdf> transmission of
smallpox in Afghanistan was not interrupted until September 1972. In 1971
there were 736 cases of smallpox identified in Afghanistan (page 16 of
reference) - Mod.MPP].

Re: Dr. Sauri's commentary.
As the co-editor of the forthcoming occasional paper by the Monterey
Institute of International Studies that contains the translated report of
the 1971 Aralsk smallpox outbreak. I take this opportunity to clear up a
few points.
First, there is no suggestion in either the original report or in Dr.
Zelicoff's analysis that Soviet military scientists "might have genetically
engineered a smallpox virus." This was quite beyond their capabilities at
that time. If they had weaponized the smallpox virus, it would have been
done using classical techniques.
Second, the main implication of this event is that the Soviet Union was
working on weaponizing the smallpox virus since at least the late 1960s,
and possibly earlier. The Western intelligence services did not learn of
this work until 1989, when the first defector from Biopreparat, Dr.
Vladimir Pasechnik, was debriefed and can be assumed to have provided this
information. This means that Soviet military scientists, having had more
than 20 years to weaponize smallpox virus and supported by nearly unlimited
funds, certainly had plenty of opportunity to develop a strain of smallpox
virus that would exceed the pathogenic and virulence potentials of wild
strains. (Just think of what a high level scientific team at CDC or
USAMRIID could have accomplished if it had been given a similar mission!)
Given this history, it is of vital importance to global health security
that the Russian government provide information about smallpox strains that
were weaponized during the Soviet period so we can test our vaccines
against them. This also means that the 3 closed Russian military biological
institutes, including the Institute of Virology at Sergiyev Posad, must be
opened up to foreign visitations.
Third, given that the Soviet Union weaponized the smallpox virus and
formulated it for use as an aerosol, it would be wise for government
officials now working on crafting a policy for meeting the threat of
bioterrorism to take this into account. In other words, the common thinking
is that were terrorists to acquire smallpox virus, they would disseminate
it among a target population via infected individuals. In view of the
Soviet work with smallpox, it is necessary for officials to also consider
how best to prepare for and respond to an attack that utilized aerosolized
smallpox virus.

From: Alan P. Zelicoff <apzelic@sandia.gov>

Regarding the previously unknown outbreak of smallpox in 1971 in Aralsk
(Soviet Union), I would like to augment Dr. Michael A. Sauri's assessment
(posted on ProMED on 18 Jun 2002) of both the intent and content of my
presentation at the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) last weekend.
1. The key point that I was trying to make was that, for the first time, we
now have data that smallpox can indeed be aerosolized and propagated over
large distances (many kilometers). Previously, smallpox experts stated that
this was simply not possible due to the environmental instability of the
virus. I am pleased to see that DA Henderson acknowledged this morning
that, indeed, smallpox can be "hardened" to so behave (see:
<http://www.cnn.com/2002/HEALTH/conditions/06/20/smallpox.vaccine/index.html>)
He had previously asserted at the NAS meeting that this could not be done.
2. The significance of this finding is its effect on all of the smallpox
propagation models presented at the NAS. To illustrate with only one of the
models (that of Dr. Ed Kaplan): the "decision point" for the strategy of
mass vaccination vs. vaccination on warning or pre-attack vaccination of a
selected group of people (physicians, public health officials, nurses,
critical infrastructure workers) depends MOST sensitively on the
"reproductive ratio" of clinical smallpox (i.e., the number of people each
person with smallpox may go on to infect) AND the number of initial cases.
In Dr. Kaplan's model, if we assume that the reproductive ratio is less
than about 2 (a very conservative assumption according to what I've read
from smallpox experts) and an initial number of cases less than about 30,
then mass vaccination is NOT the appropriate strategy (due to the side
effects of the vaccine outweighing the benefits). However (and this is very
important), if the number of index cases rises into the hundreds, then even
with a very much lower reproductive ratio (near "1"), mass vaccination IS
the appropriate strategy. Obviously an aerosol dissemination would create a
substantially larger number of initial cases than would, say, introduction
of some number of infected people into the US population. Thus, vaccination
strategy may change, given our existing vaccine.
3. Repeatedly emphasizing at the NAS that the numbers (that we know about)
in the Aralsk outbreak are small (10 total cases), I compared the apparent
rate of transmissibility in those households where the data was available
to the Pakistan outbreak, stratified by vaccination status of the household
index case (see: Heiner, G.G., Fatima, N., and McCrumb, F.R. "A Study of
Intrafamilial Transmission of Smallpox," American Journal of Epidemiology,
vol. 94, pp. 252-268. also summarized in Fenner's Smallpox book). Using a
non-parametric model (Chi-square), the Aralsk outbreak differs
significantly in the likelihood of transmission after taking into account
the vaccination status of the index case. Dr. Sauri is entitled to conclude
that the Aralsk outbreak is no different in this regard than what we have
seen elsewhere, but the statistics don't support him.
4. Regarding hemorrhagic disease in the Aralsk outbreak, there are clearly
too few cases to draw any firm conclusions about the overall attack rate
for this variety of disease. However, what is striking is that in Aralsk
there were 2 infants with hemorrhagic disease among the 10 patients; in
Rao's series of 10 857 patients (published in 1964) and in his series of
6900 (published in 1972), infants almost never got hemorrhagic disease
(overall rate much less than 1 percent). Is there something different about
the strain that resulted in this difference? A simple binomial calculation
indicates that there was a difference, but I don't think that any
statistician would be comfortable drawing conclusions on just 2 cases.
However, I do believe that the question about "strain" vs. "host-factors"
in understanding clinical varieties of smallpox is a legitimate one to ask.
This distinction has been dismissed in the past by smallpox experts.
One final point: when we think about vaccination strategies for smallpox
prophylaxis, we tend to focus on the vaccine itself. However, in the "ring
vaccination" strategy employed in Africa and Asia in the 1960s and 1970s,
and in Yugoslavia (1972) and Aralsk (1971), heroic efforts were made to
identify cases, isolate them, and also to severely limit all movement --
particularly of contacts -- for weeks. To the best of my knowledge, it is
not possible to distinguish the impact of the non-vaccination portion of
the ring strategy from the impact of the vaccine per se (if there is data
to refute this point, I would very much like to see it, of course). Thus,
vaccination policy decisions turn on much more than the vaccine itself, and
even with the ability to massively vaccinate in the setting of an actual
attack, the practicalities may be unacceptable to many Americans. Hence my
suggestion at the end of the NAS presentation: we should investigate other
vaccines (ones that may be both more effective and less problematic) and
supplement any vaccine-based strategy with anti-viral drugs. Fortunately,
the latter are now being tested, though on a shoe-string budget.
