One person has died, and 8 others received treatment of suspected anthrax at the Chuka County Referral Hospital in Tharaka-Nithi County. The patients and the victim, who come from Mubukuro village, are said to have come into contact with meat of a sick cow.

Speaking to journalists from his hospital bed, F.G. said he was called by the owner of the cow 2 weeks ago after the animal fell sick and together with the victim slaughtered it. [There is a picture of Mr. G. with a bandage on the back of his right hand, and a swollen area below his left eye. - Mod.MHJ]

"The animal was almost dying when we slaughtered it," said Mr. G. He said they hanged the meat in a house and the following day called a veterinary officer who after inspecting the meat advised them to bury it. Mr. G. noted that 4 days later he started developing a swell on his left eye and went to the hospital where he was admitted.

County Health director Dr. Tony Njoka said the man who died admitted to hospital on [Mon 22 Oct 2018] with a severe headache and loss of consciousness, adding that the hospital is yet to confirm if he died of anthrax.

County chief officer in charge of medical services Mr. Kimathi Njeru said a team of veterinary and public health officers have already visited the village for further investigation and public sensitisation.

"We have disinfected the area and advised the locals to report any case of a sick animal and avoid eating uninspected meat," he said.

[I checked the other Kenyan newspapers and so far this is the only report of suspected anthrax in Chuka. Chuka is a town on the eastern slopes of Mount Kenya, in Kenya about 65 km (approx. 40 mi) south of Meru Town. It falls within Tharaka-Nithi County and the former Eastern Province. Between 1992 and 2009, Chuka was the capital of Tharaka Nithi District. Tharaka Nithi is in what was Eastern Province (http://legacy.lib.utexas.edu/maps/africa/kenya_pol88.jpg) and is pretty much in the center of Kenya. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tharaka-Nithi_County). The last report we have of anthrax in Tharaka Nithi was in December 2017; see: 27 Dec 2017 Anthrax - Kenya (09): (NT) livestock 20171227.5524389. Like this one, it was related to careless handling of an infected carcass. - Mod.MHJ
