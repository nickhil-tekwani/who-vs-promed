Ebola-like Virus Hits Zimbabwe
-------------------------------------
One person has died while three suspected cases of the viral
haemorragic fever, a disease almost identical to the Ebola virus,
have been reported in Zimbabwe.
According to the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare of Zimbabwe, all
three cases had reported a history of having recently travelled to the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Herald newspaper said
Thursday.
The ministry said in a statement Wednesday night that one of the sick
people died Wednesday morning while the other two were alive but in
critical condition.
The disease has also been reported in neighboring Namibia which has
confirmed the emergence of the bubonic plague in the north of the
country bordering with Angola.
Three people have died and at least another seven are in hospital.
The first case of the fever was reported in January and a total of 68 cases
have been reported from Durba in the Watsa Province in the
northeastern part of the DRC.
Sixty-three of the 68 people suspected to have had the disease have
died.
The signs and symptoms include headache, high fever, chills, vomiting,
diarrhoea, and internal and external bleeding.
Transmission is person-to-person by direct contact with infected blood,
secretions, organs or semen while there is no treatment or vaccine.
The ministry has recommended that should one suspect any of the signs
and symptoms of the disease, all patients should be isolated and strict
barrier nursing methods must be practised.
"All people travelling to and from the DRC are requested to be on the
alert," said the report.
Meanwhile, the ministry has put all health centers on the alert while the
army medical directorate has been informed and put on the alert.

Ebola-like killer virus emerges in Zimbabwe
-----------------------------------
An outbreak of a deadly haemorrhagic fever with symptoms similar to
Ebola has killed at least one person in Zimbabwe, health officials
announced on Thursday. The health ministry said at least three cases
have been identified in people recently returned from the Democratic
Republic of Congo, where at least 75 people have died after contracting
an Ebola-like virus.
All three were admitted to Harare's main teaching hsopital last week and
one died Wednesday while the rest are in critical condition. The
ministry did not identify the three victims of the virus whose symptoms
include high fever, chills, diarrhoea, bleeding and headaches.
Zimbabwean soldiers, who have deployed in their thousands to fight in
the civil conflict in the DRC alongside President Laurent Kabila's troops,
regularly return home for breaks.
"All people travelling to and from the DRC are requested to be on alert.
The army medical directorate has been informed and put on alert," said
Batsi Makunike of the epidemiology and disease centre at the ministry of
health.
Following an outbreak of the disease which caused at least 75 deaths in
Durba in the Ituri district of Oriental province, northeastern DRC, since
the start of the year, the World Health Organisation has concluded that
the disease is not Ebola, but of the same family.
The state-run Herald reported that Namibia, which also has troops in the
DRC, has also reported cases of Ebola-like fever.
