A fish kill involving several hundred carp and some sunfish in
Pompton Lake appears to be natural in origin and not the result of
sediment borings that DuPont had been conducting in the lake, state
environmental officials said.

Local residents and DuPont workers first noticed dead carp floating
along the shoreline late last week [week of 17 May 2010], and the
numbers had increased by Monday[24 May 2010], said Edward Merrill,
the borough's environmental officer.

"It appears this is a naturally occurring disease in the fish, and
not an environmental issue because other fish in the lake were fine,"
said Lawrence Ragonese, a spokesman for the state Department of
Environmental Protection.

"We've had the same thing occur in a host of other ponds in the area,
and it seems to be a naturally occurring bacteria which runs for
several days to a week and then runs its course. It seems to affect
the weaker fish."

The DEP was not able to pinpoint yet the exact cause of the kill,
since officials were not able to collect a fish carcass that was
fresh enough for analysis, Ragonese said.

Merrill said that DuPont, which owns a former explosives plant in the
borough, has had several boats out on the lake in recent days
collecting sediment borings as part of the company's research on
contamination in the lake bottom. The company is scheduled to file a
detailed report this summer [2010] with the DEP on how it plans to
remove the sediment, laced with mercury that washed from its facility
into the lake.

The boring work does not appear related to the fish kill, Ragonese
said. He said dissolved oxygen levels and water temperature in the
lake were within normal range, so it was not likely the fish kill was
caused by an inversion, which sometimes occurs in spring when and
colder water sinks and warm water with less oxygen rises to the
surface where fish tend to stay.

Merrill said he also checked water bodies along the Ramapo River,
above Pompton Lake, to see if other areas were also affected. He said
he found dead carp in lesser numbers floating on Potash Lake in
Oakland, which is deeper and cooler than Pompton Lake.

The Pompton Lake kill "was not a blanket kill where all you see is a
mat of dead fish," Merrill said. "The unusual thing was they were
carp of a particular size -- there were no juvenile fish. Whatever is
affecting them, it's hitting carp that are of spawning age, which may
be more stressed because of spawning and therefore more vulnerable to
the bacteria."

In April [2010], dead sunfish were found floating on Wild Duck Pond
at Saddle River County Park in Ridgewood, as well as ponds in
Caldwell and Norwood. The DEP determined the "sunnies" had died from
a naturally occurring bacteria called _Aeromonas hydrophila_.

In July 2009, about 1500 carp died in the Hackensack River in
Rockland County, New York, and scientists theorized a virus or
bacteria caused their deaths.

[It appears that it could be Koi herpesvirus, since only carp are
affected, and carp are a type of koi. If some of the dead fish are
submitted to a diagnostic laboratory, then the exact cause of death
of these fish may more likely be found.

Koi herpesvirus (KHV), also known as cyprinid herpesvirus-3 or
CyHV-3, is a highly contagious viral disease capable of causing
significant morbidity and mortality in common carp (_Cyprinus
carpio_). In many countries, the common carp is a food fish and also
has been selectively bred for the ornamental fish industry, where it
is known as koi. Almost all countries have reported KHV, which was
first recognized in 1996 in England. However, publications (Pokorova
et al) in 2005 report that Australia does not have the disease.

The most significant sign of KHV is the sudden appearance of mass
mortality within 1-2 days of initial infection. Aside from mass
mortality, the other common signs are white patches or necrosis of
the gills. Other clinical signs are sunken eyes, bleeding gills, and
secondary bacterial infection or parasite infestation.

There is no treatment for KHV. Prevention is the key. For cultured
fish, inquiring about any mortalities may give a buyer a clue that
some fish may be carriers.
