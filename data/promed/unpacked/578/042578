As part of a routine Coggins test -- a regulatory surveillance
requirement in Missouri for all horses changing ownership or
exhibiting -- a horse located on a farm near Walker [Vernon County],
Missouri has tested positive for equine infectious anemia (EIA). The
Missouri Department of Agriculture was notified last week [week of 26
Jul 2010] of the positive result and the farm was immediately
quarantined until the test results could be confirmed. EIA is a
contagious, viral disease most commonly transmitted through horse
flies, deer flies, mosquitoes, and gnats. This disease is found in
equine species including horses, ponies, donkeys, and mules and does
not affect humans.

The EIA-positive horse was humanely euthanized at the request of the
owner and under the recommendation of Missouri's State Veterinarian
Dr Taylor Woods.

"Even though this disease does not affect humans, it is a disease
that can have a devastating impact on our horse industry," said
director of Agriculture Dr Jon Hagler. "We are continuing to closely
monitor the situation."

An additional 5 horses were tested at the same time of the initial
Coggins test -- all [with] negative results. Another 35 horses from
the property were also tested as a precautionary measure and all had
negative results.

Horse farm owners can take preventive measures to decrease the risk
of animals contracting EIA by establishing effective fly control
programs through foggers, fly repellants, and electronic or automatic
fly control systems, and sterilizing and disinfecting animal health
equipment including syringes and needles. EIA-infected animals become
lifelong carriers. There are no known vaccines available to prevent
or protect from this disease.

[Equine infectious anemia (EIA) affects Equidae and is caused by an
equid-specific lentivirus in the retrovirus family, equine infectious
anemia virus (EIAV). Although the majority of persistent infections
appear to have minimal clinical consequences, EIA may be seen in
epizootic form with high morbidity and mortality. Infection can be
accurately diagnosed with laboratory tests. Because there are no
effective and safe vaccines, many countries have established control
programs based on serologic testing.

EIA is a blood borne infection; virus can be found free in the plasma
or cell-associated. Infection with EIAV appears to persist for life
and, in nature, blood-feeding insects initiate most infections by
mechanical transfer of infective blood between horses in close
proximity. Tabanids, horseflies, and deer flies appear to be the most
efficient vectors because the pain of their bite initiates host
defensive behavior that interrupts feeding and results in additional
host-seeking behavior. As EIAV has not been shown to multiply in
insects, infected equids appear to be the only reservoir of the
virus. Iatrogenic transmission has a high epizootic potential that
can be avoided by standard precautions, such as, disposal or
decontamination of needles and equipment between horses.

Exposed equids generally support viral replication for days to weeks
before antibodies to EIAV can be detected. The incubation period
ranges from 10 to 45 days or more, usually lasting 21-42 days after
natural transmission. Peak viremia often occurs during a febrile
episode before the horse becomes test-positive. These acute signs
often go unrecognized in horses on pasture and may be accompanied by
a mild reduction in platelet counts and transient inappetence. Often,
infection is noted only after routine surveillance testing for EIA or
when the horse develops recurring clinical bouts of fever accompanied
by marked platelet reductions, petechial hemorrhages, anemia,
depression, weight loss, cachexia, and dependent edema (hallmarks of
the chronic form of EIA). EIAV infection can therefore present as an
inapparent infection or as an acute or chronic disease. The clinical
manifestations are determined in part by the viral strain and dose,
and the genetic makeup and status of the immune system of the equid.
For example, strains of EIAV adapted by rapid serial passage in
horses can kill horses within 14 days of infection but may have no
clinical effect on donkeys. Likewise, strains that produce no or mild
clinical disease in adults have killed immunologically immature
fetuses or immunodeficient foals. Frequently, EIAV enters a herd and
is transmitted silently until the chronic form of the disease is
noted. By that time, a high percentage of the herd can be infected.

Clinical diagnosis should be confirmed by serology. The agar gel
immunodiffusion (AGID, Coggins) test is internationally accepted;
antigen sources include cell culture-propagated virus and recombinant
proteins. ELISA tests for detection of antibody against EIAV antigens
are accepted in many countries and aid in the practical diagnosis of
EIAV infection. The ELISA tests can be done in minutes (compared with
1-2 days for AGID test results) and used under field conditions. In
all cases, positive ELISA tests should be confirmed by AGID before
regulatory actions are taken because of the higher rate of false
positive results. When combined, ELISA and AGID testing afford the
highest level of sensitivity and specificity.

No specific treatment or vaccine is available. As EIAV-infected
equids present the only known source of infection, antibody-positive
animals should be kept at a safe distance (around 200 m) from other
equids. The only recognized exception to this rule is the progeny of
test-positive mares, which may possess maternal antibodies to EIAV.
In the majority of cases, passive antibody against EIAV wanes to
negative on AGID tests by 6-8 mo of age.

The risk associated with maintaining EIAV-infected breeding stock
varies. Field studies have indicated excellent success in raising
test-negative foals from inapparent carriers of EIAV. The risks of
infection in utero increase dramatically if clinical signs of EIA are
seen in the mare prior to parturition. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to accurately determine the risk posed by any EIAV-infected
equid. As EIAV persists in each infected equid for life, most
regulatory agencies assume all EIAV-positive equids pose the same high risk.

Most states have some type of regulatory program as well as
surveillance requiring testing prior to changing ownership.
