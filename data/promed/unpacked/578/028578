In what is being seen as a setback for the government's efforts to eliminate poliovirus in the country, 2 new cases of poliovirus have surfaced in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, increasing the total of this year's [2019] cases to 26, ARY News reported on [Thu 20 Jun 2019].

Well-informed sources within the health ministry say the 2 cases have been reported from 2 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts. One of them was confirmed from a stool sample of a 21-month old baby girl of Wazir tehsil [sub district] of Bannu. The victim's samples were taken on [8 Jun 2019].

The 2nd case was reported from Mamakhail UC of Lakki Marwat district where a 15-month old boy was tested positive for poliovirus.

It is noteworthy that thus far 3 cases each have been reported from Punjab and Sindh provinces whereas 13 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 7 from the newly merged tribal districts of the province [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] this year [2019].

Earlier this month [June 2019], sewage samples collected from gutters of 11 sampling sites in the metropolis had confirmed prevalence of poliovirus in Karachi. The World Health Organization (WHO) had collected samples in Karachi to assess prevalence of the crippling virus in the city. According to sources, the samples were collected from gutters in Karachi during the period from [5 Apr to 16 May 2019]. The WHO gathered samples from 11 localities in the city to examine the situation of poliovirus. The samples were collected from sampling sites of Hijrat Colony, Machhar Colony, Khameso Goth, Rashid Minhas Road, Korangi, Bakhtawar Village Landhi, Haji Mureed Goth, Sohrab Goth, Mohammad Khan Colony, Orangi Nallah, Orangi Colony, and PIDC Colony.

[With the addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases, the total number of cases reported by Pakistan since 1 Jan 2019 is now 26, with cases having been reported from Bannu and the 1st case now reported from Lakki Marwat which shares its northern border with Bannu (see https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/pak215_pakistan_districts_v5_a0_20181203.pdf).

The addition of these 2 newly confirmed cases will bring the global total of cases reported with date of onset since 1 Jan 2019 to 35, surpassing the total number of cases reported to have dates of onset last year (2018).

Unfortunately the vaccination campaigns conducted during the end of April 2019 did not interrupt the transmission of the poliovirus in Pakistan. - Mod.MPP

A grand jirga in Torghar district on [Wed 19 Jun 2019] asked the people to get children administered the anti-polio vaccine to save them from the crippling disease. The jirga, which was held in the wake of the alleged death of a 5-month-old girl after allegedly being administered the anti-polio vaccine in Judbah earlier this week [week of 17 Jun 2019], was attended among others by Deputy Commissioner Tahir Khan, Assistant Commissioner Khuramur Rehman, and District Police Officer Hafiz Janis Khan, local elders, and representatives of the Health Department.

The jirga accepts clarification made by deputy commissioner and officials of Health Department that polio vaccine is hazard-free, Maulana Zakir [a participant] told the jirga. He said that it was confirmed that [the child] had died of high-grade fever and pneumonia. We are thankful to the deputy commissioner and health officials who removed misconceptions about polio vaccine and henceforth the jirga members would also disseminate this message to the people in the district, said Maulana Zakir.

Sindh Chief Minister [CM] Syed Murad Ali Shah has directed officials to devise a new strategy, work towards capacity building and register refusal cases to eradicate polio from the province, citing it as one of the biggest challenges faced by the Sindh Government. He issued these directives while presiding over a meeting of the provincial task force for polio eradication, at the Chief Minister's house on [Wed19 Jun 2019]

Chief Minister Shah pointed out that Pakistan and Afghanistan were the only countries where polio cases were still surfacing. As many as 24 polio cases have been reported in Pakistan and a total of 8 polio cases have been reported in Afghanistan, he said [see above, in the past 24 hours these numbers have increased, there are now 26 reported from Pakistan and 9 reported from Afghanistan. - Mod.MPP]

"In 2019, 3 polio cases have emerged in Sindh, which is worrying as only 1 polio case was reported in the province during 2018 in comparison to 2 reported in 2017," said the chief minister.

CM Murad takes up polio eradication challenge.
He held the provincial government responsible for the rise in the number of polio cases. "We have failed in our efforts [to curb polio], we have failed to produce results," he said. During the meeting, Shah was informed that out of the 24 polio cases reported in Pakistan during 2019 so far, 3 were from Sindh. Of the 3 polio cases in Sindh, [1] was diagnosed with polio in Larkana and [the other 2], residents of Lyrai and Gulshan-e-Iqbal, respectively, were diagnosed with the disease in Karachi.

It was also revealed in the meeting that poliovirus has been detected in 11 different areas of Karachi through environmental surveillance. Prevalence of poliovirus has also been detected in areas of rural Sindh, including New Sukkur, Hyderabad, and Dadu.

Chief Minister Shah expressed his displeasure over these findings and held relevant officials responsible for the re-emergence of polio, particularly in Dadu. Reprimanding the relevant officials for their inefficiency, he remarked that from 2015 to the March of 2019, Dadu remained clear of polio. He directed the chief secretary to take disciplinary action against relevant officials, including deputy commissioners, of the areas where poliovirus has been detected.

DC, police chief take lead in anti-polio drive.
The meeting was also informed that polio vaccine has been administered to 203 733 children in Karachi so far and 251 806 were yet to be vaccinated. Expressing displeasure over the large number of children who have not been administered polio drops, chief minister directed the polio eradication teams to register cases against parents who refuse vaccination for their children and take action against them accordingly.

Provincial Health Minister Dr Azra Pechuho, Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani, Chief Secretary Mumtaz Shah, Police IG Dr Kaleem Imam, Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Sajid Jamal Abro, provincial secretaries of home, education, health and finance, divisional commissioners, federal government representative Dr Malik M Shafi, Tim Peterson from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, John Agbor from UNICEF, Dr Abdi from WHO, Aziz Memon from Rotary International, and other relevant officials attended the meeting.
