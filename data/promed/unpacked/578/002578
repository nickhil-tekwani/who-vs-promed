I am writing in response to the posting of information available from
GIDEON on leptospirosis. General reviews such as that available on GIDEON
can be helpful, but can also be somewhat misleading. There is a tremendous
amount of information on the epidemiology of leptospirosis among domestic
and wild animals in the United States. This information is being used as a
guide in the investigation of the current outbreak of leptospirosis in
human beings associated with a triathlon in Illinois.
Rodents are not the "primary reservoir" of leptospirosis. They are one of
many wild and domestic mammals that can serve as reservoirs of
leptospirosis. Within a geographic area, each serovar of pathogenic
_Leptospira_ present will have one or more maintenance or reservoir hosts.
These maintenance hosts may be rodents but, just as commonly, are domestic
animals or other wildlife species. The list of reservoirs in the GIDEON
material is incomplete and contains animals that have no epidemiologic role
in leptospirosis. For example, frogs, snakes, and birds are not involved in
the epidemiology of leptospirosis. Rabbits are highly resistant to
infection with _Leptospira_ and are unlikely to be an important reservoir.
Hedgehogs and mongooses do not occur in the United States except as pets or
as part of zoologic collections. The major reservoirs for leptospirosis in
the US are as follows:
serovar pomona - cattle, swine, skunks, opossums
serovar hardjo - cattle
serovar grippotyphosa - raccoons
serovar canicola - dogs
serovar icterohaemorrhagiae - rats
serovar bratislava - pigs
serovar ballum - mice
Maintenance or reservoir host infections are characterized by a high
incidence of infection (~30%), relatively mild clinical signs, relatively
low antibody titers, and prolonged urinary shedding (months to years). This
is in contrast to incidental host infections which occur relatively
infrequently, produce severe clinical signs and high antibody titers, and
result in urinary shedding of short duration. Human beings are incidental
hosts of leptospirosis and human-to-human transmission is rare.
The clinical signs of leptospirosis in human beings are many and varied and
the temptation to categorize or assign specific clinical syndromes to
infection with a particular serovar should be resisted. Recent experience
in Nicaragua has shown us that a relatively common serovar or serovars can
result in startling and unexpected clinical signs (e.g., pulmonary
hemorrhage) when many people are exposed.
When outbreaks of leptospirosis occur in animals or human beings it is
essential that all involved make use of the available information to assist
in identification of the likely source(s) of infection. It has proven to be
a mistake to use outdate clinical and epidemiological dogma as a guide for
the diagnosis and control of this important zoonotic disease.
