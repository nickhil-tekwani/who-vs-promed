The Indiana State Board of Animal Health has quarantined a Lake County, Indiana boarding facility after a horse was confirmed positive for equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV). The horse was humanely euthanized after showing neurologic signs before he was confirmed for the virus. The 45 other horses at the stable will remain under quarantine until all are confirmed free of the disease.

Although it's not transmissible to humans, EHV-1 is highly contagious among horses and camelids, and it is generally passed from horse to horse via aerosol transmission (when affected animals sneeze/cough) and contact with nasal secretions. The disease can cause a variety of ailments in equines, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and myeloencephalopathy (EHM, the neurologic form).

Myeloencephalopathy is characterized by fever, ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the hind limbs, and incontinence. Should a horse with potential EHV-1 exposure display any of the aforementioned clinical signs, a veterinarian should be called to obtain samples and test for the disease.

A horse in Douglas County, Colorado, has tested positive for equine herpesvirus-1, according to a statement from the Colorado Department of Agriculture (CDA). Unlike the EHV-1 outbreak in 2011, the initial case in Colorado originated from an out-of-state stable where there have not been any other positive horses. The statement further noted that, no other Colorado exposed horses have become ill with similar signs.

Therefore, with the exception of the initial case and contact horses/premises, the State Veterinarian did not recommend movement or event restrictions. EHV-1 is not transmissible to people; it can be a serious disease of horses that can cause respiratory and neurologic disease and death.

The most common way for EHV-1 to spread is by direct horse-to-horse contact. The virus can also spread through the air, contaminated tack and equipment, clothing and hands. EHV-1 vaccines do not protect against the neurologic form, also called equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (EHM).

[Usually the disease is abbreviated as EHV for equine herpes virus or EHM for equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy.

Equine herpesvirus (EHV-1) infection in horses can cause respiratory and neurological disease, abortion in mares, and neonatal foal death. The neurological form of the disease is known as equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) and has the potential to cause high morbidity and mortality.

EHV-1 is easily spread and typically has an incubation period between 2-10 days. Respiratory shedding of the virus generally occurs for 7-10 days but may persist longer in infected horses. For this reason, the isolation period recommendation for confirmed positive EHM cases is 21 days. Clinical signs of EHM in horses may include nasal discharge, incoordination, hindquarter weakness, recumbency, lethargy, urine dribbling, and diminished tail tone. The prognosis for EHM positive horses depends on the severity of signs and the period of recumbency. Employing supportive treatment with intravenous fluids, anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-viral drugs, and other supportive measures may be beneficial, since there is no specific treatment for EHM.

Currently, no EHV-1 equine vaccine has a label claim for protection against the neurological strain of the virus.
