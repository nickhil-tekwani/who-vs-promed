Mongolia's Health Ministry declared an outbreak of the life-threatening meningococcal disease. Meningococcal infections have been reported among young children in the country recently, the ministry said on Thursday [10 Mar 2022], urging parents and guardians to take precautions to protect their children from the disease.

The disease is caused by bacteria named _Neisseria meningitidis_ and can cause infections in the linings of the brain or the blood, or both. It has a high mortality rate if untreated, but is vaccine-preventable. The common symptoms of the disease include sudden fever, vomiting, nausea, headache, a stiff neck, backache and increased sensitivity to light.

[_Neisseria meningitidis_, the cause of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD), infects only humans; there is no animal reservoir, and the organism dies quickly outside the human host. _N. meningitidis_, which colonizes the mucosal membranes of the nose and throat, is spread person to person by sharing respiratory and throat secretions (e.g., coughing or kissing). Close and prolonged contact with an infected person or carrier facilitates the spread of the disease. The average incubation period is 4 days but can range between 2 and 10 days.

People at increased risk of IMD include household members and roommates of a patient with IMD, and anyone with direct contact with the patient's oral secretions, such as a boyfriend or girlfriend. These close contacts should receive antibiotics to help prevent them from getting the disease.

Meningococcal meningitis occurs most frequently in the elderly, infants, and teenagers and young adults, especially if living in group settings, such as dormitories, boarding schools and military bases. Certain rare medical conditions and medications increase the risk for IMD, including complement component deficiencies, functional or anatomic asplenia, HIV/AIDS, and complement inhibitor medications, e.g., eculizumab (Soliris) and ravulizumab (Ultomiris).

We are not told in the news report above the demographic characteristics or underlying medical conditions of the patients in the outbreak of IMD in Mongolia, other than they were young children. Nor are we told the number of cases, the timeline over which the cases occurred, or the geographic distribution of the cases.

Meningococci are classified into serogroups based on the antigenic specificity of their polysaccharide capsule. Although there are at least 13 _N. meningitidis_ serogroups, 6 serogroups (A, B, C, X, W, and Y) cause almost all IMD globally. Immunity following the use of a meningococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine is specific for the type of capsular polysaccharide that the vaccine contains, with no cross-protection against infection due to other meningococcal polysaccharide groups. Some vaccines contain capsular polysaccharides (A, C, Y, W), conjugated to a protein, e.g., the MenC and the quadrivalent MenACWY vaccines. Conjugate vaccines immunize infants, reduce the carriage of meningococci in the throat and thus its transmission, as well as confer a more sustained immune response, and, therefore, longer-term protection than vaccines that contain polysaccharide alone. Serogroup B (MenB) vaccines are based upon meningococcal B protein antigens because group B capsular polysaccharide is poorly immunogenic in humans and may stimulate autoantibodies.

Some countries, such as in the UK, include meningococcal vaccines in their routine childhood vaccine schedule (https://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/vk/uk-schedule). We are not told in the news report above if Mongolia's routine childhood vaccine schedule includes a meningococcal vaccine, the vaccine status of the infected children, or the meningococcal serogroup(s) of the outbreak strain(s).

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
