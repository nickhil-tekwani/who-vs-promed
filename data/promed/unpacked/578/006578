[This ProMED-mail posting is to clarify issues raised in the recent
posting: Equine Influenza - Australia (05): suspect. 20080925.3037. - Mod.TG]

The recent ProMED-mail posting is based on reports in the popular
press, which do not give an accurate impression of the equine
influenza (EI) situation in Australia. Contrary to these reports,
evidence does not support there being a case of EI in the Australian
quarantine system. Furthermore, Australian animal health authorities
are confident that the Australian horse population remains free of EI.

Test suspect horse in quarantine
-------------------------
Following the breakdown of EI quarantine in 2007 and the resulting EI
epidemic in Australia, quarantine protocols were strengthened. Under
these protocols, all imported horses are required to be tested with a
PCR [polymerase chain reaction] test 5 times before they are
considered free of infection. Two of these tests occur in pre-export
quarantine and 3 in post- arrival quarantine in Australia.

Currently, there are 74 horses in quarantine at the Eastern Creek
Quarantine station. These horses have all been subjected to 4 PCR
tests during the quarantine period, all of which were negative. All
74 horses were recently sampled for their 5th PCR tests before being
considered free of infection. However, in this final round of
testing, one horse returned a marginally positive result. This horse
has since retested negative on a repeat sample at the same government
laboratory. Additional samples from all horses, including the one
with indeterminate test results, were sent to the Australian Animal
Health Laboratory for confirmatory testing. All horses remained in
quarantine pending the outcome of this testing. No clinical signs of
EI have been detected in the quarantined horses. Follow-up testing
and re-testing has confirmed that the suspect horse and all other
horses in the quarantine station are negative to EI.

Australia's freedom from EI
---------------------------
EI has been eradicated from Australia and the country has remained
free from any evidence of this disease.

During last year's [2007] outbreak, Australia contained the infection
to just 3 percent of the continent with movement restrictions and
other means. Following the final case of EI in December 2007,
Australia undertook a comprehensive surveillance program to
demonstrate that disease had truly been eradicated. More than 35 000
horses were tested with PCR.

This surveillance program had several components.
1. A random surveillance program
The random surveillance program in previously infected areas
demonstrated that Australia could be more than 99 percent confident
that disease would have been detected if less than one percent of
premises were still infected, thus exceeding international standards
(World Organisation for Animal Health).

2. Targeted surveillance programs
Thousands of horses underwent targeted surveillance in previously
infected regions to detect any residual disease. This included
surveillance at horse events, veterinary clinics, and other
aggregations of horses.

3. Suspect case investigations
Several hundred horses that displayed signs of respiratory disease
were investigated in uninfected areas, and in previously infected
regions. No disease has been detected. Investigation of suspect cases
continues.

Following the lifting of all movement restrictions and close mixing
between naive horses and previously infected horses, there has been
no recurrent epidemic of respiratory disease in Australia. An
epidemic of respiratory disease would be expected in naive
populations if EI were still present in Australia.

4. Risk assessment and surveillance of feral horse populations
Most feral horse populations in Australia are in remote northern
regions, geographically removed from the previously infected portion
of Australia. However, feral horse populations that were in regions
of infection underwent individual risk assessments. These indicated
that feral horse populations, if infected, would be unlikely to
maintain or spread infection due to extremely low population
densities and other ecological characteristics. Some feral
populations also underwent surveillance with no infection detected.
Additionally, surveillance of premises close to feral horse
populations revealed no infection with EI.
