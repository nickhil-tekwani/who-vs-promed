[Utah] state wildlife officials say they've detected a case of the bird flu in a duck that was hunted in Davis County.

The Utah Department of Agriculture and Food says test results show an American widgeon duck had the H5N8 strain of the flu. Other birds found near the Great Salt Lake in Davis County are also being tested. So far, none have been found with the flu.

Officials say there is no immediate health threat for people.

But, they are warning domestic bird owners to take steps to protect their animals since the flu strain can be transmitted from wild birds.

State wildlife officials are also warning hunters to wear gloves while handling birds and wash their hands thoroughly.

Cases of the bird flu have been detected in several other Western states.

[Aquatic wild birds are the natural reservoirs of low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. Before the emergence of highly pathogenic AI (HPAI) H5N1 almost a decade ago, the general rule was that LPAI could mutate to HPAI when infecting domestic fowl, generating outbreaks that were always associated with domestic birds. Wild birds deaths were restricted to those in the vicinity of affected farms. It is thought that Asian HPAI H5N1 is found in a very small number of species (presumably belonging to the genus _Anas_) in which it could be perpetuated. These species would suffer long subclinical viremia which enables them to migrate and carry it to novel regions. H5N1 is still there causing troubles but it never reached the Americas.

Early in 2014, a new HPAI with similar ability to propagate globally appeared: H5N2. In November it reached Europe and on 16 Dec 2014 it was found in the USA. In addition, an H5N2 HPAI virus was identified in a wild northern pintail (_Anas acuta_) in the same county of Washington state in the US as the 1st case of H5N8 HPAI. This virus has the same Eurasian H5 gene as the H5N8 HPAI viruses but an N2 gene from a North American wild waterfowl low pathogenic avian influenza virus, which suggests it is circulating among wild birds; but the route of entrance and mechanisms of spread need to be investigated.

Ecoepidemiological studies, surveillance in domestic and wild birds, as well as strengthening biosecurity practices should be encouraged.
