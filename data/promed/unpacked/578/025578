NSW [New South Wales] Health is urging people to be alert for symptoms of meningococcal disease. People in NSW are being warned to be alert to the symptoms of meningococcal disease after the death of a 3rd person in the state this year [2022].

NSW Health says there have been 29 cases reported this year, the majority due to the meningococcal B strain of the infection.

A woman in her late teens died recently from the disease and NSW Health is warning it can be fatal within hours if left untreated.

Meningococcal disease is now uncommon due to vaccination but there has been a slight increase in cases in recent weeks, compared with the same period over the previous 5 years.

The disease can occur in people even if they have been vaccinated and children under five and 15 to 25-year-olds are at the greatest risk of contracting the infection.

NSW Health's Jeremy McAnulty says early intervention can be lifesaving. "Meningococcal disease symptoms can appear suddenly and become very serious very quickly. I urge everyone not to discount symptoms when they appear or assume it may be just a mild infection. If you suspect meningococcal disease, don't wait for the rash -- see a doctor immediately," Dr McAnulty said in a statement.

The symptoms include: severe, unexplained limb pain, difficulty waking up, high pitched crying in babies, severe headache, aversion to bright lights, stiff neck, and a red-purple rash that doesn't disappear when pressed with a glass. The rash does not always occur or may present late in the illness. "If symptoms rapidly worsen, or if your child is very unwell, call triple zero or go straight to your nearest emergency department," Dr McAnulty said.

[On 6 Aug 2022, ProMED posted a report of the death of a man in his 40s from Sydney with meningococcal disease (ProMED post Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (05): (NS) fatal, RFI 20220806.8704895). We were not told of the meningococcal serogroup involved or epidemiologic linkage to other cases. A week later, ProMED posted reports that the Sydney man in his 40s had attended the Splendour in the Grass music festival about 2 weeks earlier, as did 2 other persons who developed meningococcal disease (ProMED post Meningitis, meningococcal - Australia (06): (NS) fatal, 3 cases, festival, RFI 20220813.8705018). No further information has ever been given about patient characteristics, epidemiologic linkages (other than having attended the music festival), or the meningococcal serogroup(s) involved.

Then on 4 Dec 2022, ProMED posted a news article that reported a case of meningococcal meningitis in a person who attended another music festival (the Spilt Milk festival in Canberra at Exhibition Park) on 26 Nov 2022. We were not given further details about the case or the meningococcal serogroup involved. Canberra is located in the Australian Capital Territory within NSW, about 150 miles (240 km) southwest of Sydney, NSW.

We are now told above of a recent meningococcal meningitis death of a 3rd person in NSW, a woman in her late teens, and that there have been 29 cases of meningococcal meningitis reported this year in NSW, the majority due to meningococcus serogroup B. We are not told of the circumstances in detail of the 3 meningococcal meningitis deaths in NSW.

More information on this case and any further epidemiologically linked cases and the meningococcal serogroups involved would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
