LASSA FEVER, IMPORTED - GERMANY ex WEST AFRICA (02)

From: "Dr. Herbert Schmitz" <Schmitz@bni.uni-hamburg.de>

We got the material of the 22 year old (sic) woman from Wuerzburg on
Tuesday afternoon [11 Jan. 2000] at about 5 p.m. The patient had been
treated for malaria without clinical improvement. Only 12 hours later
we had a positive RT-PCR [reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction test] result for Lassa virus RNA. This result was reported to the
clinicians at Wuerzburg on Wednesday (12 Jan 2000) early in the
morning (7:30 a.m.).
Also ribavirin treatment was initiated.
In the meantime the amplified material was sequenced (82% homology
to Josiah, 65% to Nigeria strain). The virus is growing in tissue culture.
The patient had become sick in Ivory Coast on 2 Jan 2000 and returned
sick to Frankfurt Airport on 7 Jan 2000. She only arrived in the hospital
for tropical diseases at Wuerzburg 3 day later. Thus the specific
treatment started very late. Prof. Fleischer (Wuerzburg) told me this
morning that in addition to pneumonia and hepatitis, also renal failure
and CNS symptoms were seen.

[Dr Schmitz omitted to refer to his published work on Lassa diagnosis:
Lunkenheimer K, Hufert FT, Schmitz H
Detection of Lassa virus RNA in specimens from patients with Lassa
fever by using the polymerase chain reaction. J Clin Microbiol. 1990
Dec;28(12):2689-92.
Another relevant reference is:
Auperin DD, McCormick JB Nucleotide sequence of the Lassa virus
(Josiah strain) S genome RNA and amino acid sequence comparison of
the N and GPC proteins to other arenaviruses. Virology. 1989
Feb;168(2):421-5.]
The Josiah strain is from Sierra Leone. The virus was previously
known from that country, Liberia, Guinea & Nigeria. This case
originating in either Ghana or Cote d'Ivoire extends its confirmed range,
but not surprisingly, since the latter 2 countries lie in between the others
on the West African coast, with Cote d'Ivoire closer to Sierra Leone
than to Nigeria, just as the sequence shows.
****** Dr Schmitz is to be congratulated on his rapid laboratory
diagnosis, & on making it directly available in his own words to
interested public health personnel -- & the general public -- through
ProMED-mail. This is a much more accurate method of diffusion than
via the media, which has an unfortunate tendency to get the details wrong. -
