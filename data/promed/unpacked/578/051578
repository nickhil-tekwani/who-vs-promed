Status of rural carbuncle [anthrax] in Argentina in 2018
---------------------------------------------------------

Summary
--------
After 41 years of assessments, we insist that in order to control rural carbuncle "it is necessary to have a certificate of vaccination of susceptible categories and to efficiently eliminate the carcasses of bovines dying all of a sudden." These 2 sanitation activities would provide encouraging results for control of this endemic zoonosis in this stock-breeding country.

1. Assessment area of rural carbuncle in the province of Buenos Aires (1977-2018): It was not possible to maintain the area free of outbreaks. One outbreak in the district of Laprida [was recorded] during the summer [2018], which tarnished the zero-outbreak record achieved during 2017. The percentage distribution recorded in the 1977-2018 term stands at an average of 10% of _Bacillus anthracis_ in bovines that died suddenly, thus showing an encouraging difference of 9 percentage points below for 2018.

2. Alert zone and response, district of Azul (2004-2018): There have been no bovine carbuncle [anthrax] outbreaks or sick people as to this matter since 2013. There is a historic record of 67 carbuncle outbreaks, which originated 22 human alerts and 21 veterinary alerts. From the beginning to this date, 2 384 598 bovines have been simultaneously vaccinated, foot-and-mouth disease and carbuncle.

3. Isolations in other veterinary diagnostic labs (2006-2018): By applying a similar diagnostic methodology, 5 labs of the province of Buenos Aires and La Pampa managed to process a total of 72 samples and to isolate 8 strains of _Bacillus anthracis_: 2 in the province of Buenos Aires (Bahia Blanca-Rauch) and 6 in the province of La Pampa (Utracan (2), Caleu Caleu (3), Lihuel Calel (1)), showing an annual percentage distribution of 11%, a disturbing increase of 9 percentage points above if compared to last year [2017].

4. Districts of the province of Buenos Aires involved in carbuncle outbreaks: It may be stated that 53 districts of the province of Buenos Aires suffered at least one bovine carbuncle outbreak during this 41-year period of assessments. This year [2018], 3 outbreaks were detected in the districts of Laprida, Rauch, and Bahia Blanca.

5. Production of anti-carbuncle vaccine for veterinary use: Eight (8) labs manufactured 21 504 090 doses, thus showing an encouraging increase of production of 2 467 675 doses compared to the production of 2017.

6. Mandatory bovine vaccination: Three (3) areas of mandatory anti-carbuncle vaccination were assessed:
a. Province of Buenos Aires (Law No. 6703/61): The bovine stock was 19 200 000, with a susceptible population of 13 271 403, out of which 10 261 784 bovines (77%) were [target] vaccinated; these figures show consolidation of mandatory vaccination.
b. Province of Santa Fe (Resolution No. 1007/14): The bovine stock was 6 204 694, with a susceptible population of 4 697 505, out of which 4 368 679 bovines (93%) were [target] vaccinated.
c. Alert zone and response - district of Azul, province of Buenos Aires (Decree No. 661-2004): The bovine stock was 635 000, with a susceptible population of 390 000 bovines, out of which 384 906 (98%) were [target] vaccinated, a remarkable achievement of veterinaries from the district of Azul.

7. Cases of human carbuncle countrywide: Six (6) cases of skin carbuncle were reported countrywide: 5 in the province of Santa Fe and 1 in the province of Buenos Aires (SINAVE 2018-Bulletin No. 435/19).

Conclusions
---------
There are still isolations of _Bacillus anthracis_ (9) in items 1-3 of the systematized assessment, thus showing the endemic nature of bovine carbuncle in the provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa. The mandatory vaccination programs as provided by law show better vaccination coverage -- province of Buenos Aires, 77% of susceptible bovines; province of Santa Fe, 93% of susceptible bovines; and Azul alert zone and response, 98% of such category -- and the benefits might be reflected during 2019. The purpose is to obtain a timely answer from the National Health Authority (SENASA) and provincial health entities, requiring mandatory vaccination as provided by the law, together with the timely intervention of carbuncle outbreaks reported, which constitute the measures for prevention and protection of legally protected assets: human health and bovine cattle health, as the source of production of this stockbreeding country.

[Our thanks to Ramon for his annual report on the anthrax situation in Argentina. They are working hard and will, in due course, I am sure, be seen to be completely successful. It is coming. In the area of maximum control and surveillance, there was a single case in Laprida, though there had been none there in 2017. Elsewhere in the province of Buenos Aires, there were 2 outbreaks, in Bahia Blanca and Rauch, and in the province of La Pampa, there were 6 outbreaks, in Utracan (2), Caleu Caleu (3), and Lihuel Calel (1). It is interesting that the 5 human cases in Santa Fe province are reported without any related reported livestock cases, which certainly would have occurred. So as the Azul programme successfully winds down, we can expect to see extra efforts going into the provinces of La Pampa and Santa Fe. Their success will come, and it will have been earned. - Mod.MHJ
