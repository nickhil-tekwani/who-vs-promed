At least 43 cases of Japanese encephalitis were recorded across Tripura in the last 4 months as per a report. Of the total, 19 were women. The record stated that these cases were reported from May till 26 Aug [2016]. However, no death occurred due to the Japanese encephalitis.

Official sources said that 10 cases were reported from West District, 4 cases in Sepahijala District, 6 cases each in Khowai District, Gomati District and Dhalai District, 3 cases each in South District and Unakoti District and 5 cases in North Tripura.

The Health Department has taken certain preventive measures to tackle the situation.

Last year [2015], 3 children died soon after being administered anti-Japanese encephalitis [what was given?]. Later, the Tripura government urged Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to send a team to investigate the cause of the 3 deaths. During that time, a total of 207 986 children between the age group of 1-15 years old were vaccinated in 3 districts -- West Tripura, Sepahijala and Khowai -- as part of national level immunization programme.

[Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus is endemic in north eastern India and cases occur there yearly during the transmission season. This report indicates that all the reported cases are JE only and does not attribute any cases to the non-specific acute encephalitis syndrome that has been reported in many previous reports from north eastern India. Although vaccination in the areas was mentioned, there is no indication if the JE cases reported above had been vaccinated, or if a vaccination campaign in the state is planned.
