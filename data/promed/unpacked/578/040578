Minnesota Animal Health officials have confirmed the 1st highly pathogenic avian influenza case in our region.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
A turkey flock in Otter Tail County tested positive for the deadly virus this week. 21 000 birds on that farm will be killed to prevent the spread of the disease. To date, 26 turkey farms in Minnesota have been hit by the avian influenza outbreak, affecting over 1.6 million birds.


Also this week, a flock of 67 000 turkeys in Roberts County in northeast South Dakota was diagnosed with the virus.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture's chief veterinary officer says the country's poultry industry may have to live with a deadly bird flu strain for several years, and it could be devastating.

Dr. John Clifford spoke Thursday [16 Apr 2015] in Minnesota, the state hit hardest by outbreaks that led to the deaths of over 2 million turkeys and chickens in the Midwest since early March 2015.

Clifford says that while new cases should drop close to zero once the weather warms up and kills off the H5N2 virus, there will "very likely" be a resurgence this fall [2015] when the wild waterfowl that are natural carriers of avian influenza fly south for the winter.

He says government and industry need to use the lull to learn and prepare.

[Minnesota is hard hit right now with this disease.

It may be helpful to look at a map to try and understand some flyways of wild birds http://f.tqn.com/y/birding/1/S/H/G/-/-/north-america-migration-flyways.jpg. Wild birds may well have brought the disease and may have started the cycle, but the current cycle seems to be maintaining itself and spreading through some other mechanism, and perhaps currently the spread is not by wild birds, but by some other mechanism. - Mod.TG]

[A reader comments that if warm weather kills off the H5N2 virus, why is it spreading in tropical Asia and Central America (Belize)?
I also wonder what preparations are envisaged. - Mod.JW
