The provincial government Saturday [26 Jan 2008] expressed alarm over the
reported outbreak of typhoid fever in a remote village [in the municipality
of Bayombong, capital of Nueva Vizcaya province] with more than 22 families
reportedly already suffering from the disease. As of 26 Jan 2008, reports
from the provincial health office [in Bayombong] indicated that at least 80
individuals have already been affected by the illness since 21 Jan 2008 in
Sitio Logpon alone, which is part of Barangay [district] Kongkong in
indigenous people-dominated mountain town of Kasibu.
These reports, according to Dr Edwin Galapon, officer-in-charge of the
provincial health office, had prompted the provincial government led by
governor Luisa Lloren-Cuaresma to immediately dispatch a team of health
experts to conduct operations in the affected area to prevent the further
spread of the disease.
Reports showed that at least 30 typhoid fever-affected persons, both adults
and children, have already been confined at the Kasibu District Hospital
and the Nueva Vizcaya provincial hospital in Bambang town since the start
of the outbreak earlier this week [21-27 Jan 2008].
Galapon, however, admitted that a big number of patients in the place still
have to receive any form of medical treatment due to their remoteness from
the nearest rural health unit. This, he said, may become a factor in the
further spread of the waterborne disease in the nearby villages if they
remain unchecked.

More than 100 residents of the village of Kisulad here were brought to
various hospitals since last week [14-20 Jan 2008] due to typhoid fever.
Health workers confirmed the prevalence of the waterborne disease from the
results of laboratory tests made on residents brought to the Davao del Sur
provincial hospital in Digos City and other hospitals, village health
worker Loreta Menesis said Wednesday [23 Jan 2008].
"We thought they were just experiencing ordinary fever," Menesis said.
Residents of Sitio Manaypan, which has 34 households, said most of their
children suffered from typhoid. One man said all his 6 children were
afflicted with the disease.
Mayor Rody Mariscal said it was the 1st time he heard about the prevalence
of typhoid in the village. Mariscal said he immediately convened health
workers to assess the situation and to determine if there was already an
outbreak. He said town officials will also try to determine the source of
the disease. Kisulad is a coastal village and most residents get their
drinking water from shallow wells.

Governor Joseph C Cua has ordered the Provincial Health Office and Rural
Health Units to intensify their information campaign on proper hygiene
practices among the public even as health officials described the recent
spate of suspected typhoid fever cases as "not alarming."
According to the preliminary report prepared by team leader provincial
health officer I Rico P Lareza and submitted to the governor through
provincial health officer II Wilfredo P Santelices, [there was] an increase
in the number of suspected typhoid fever cases from 1 Dec 2007 to 9 Jan 2008.
The report stated that a total of 115 cases were admitted at the Eastern
Bicol Medical Center during the period. The ages of those admitted ranged
from 2 years to 67 years, with majority of them adults. Over half were
males while 100 were from the capital town of Virac. San Andres and Baras
had 4 each while San Miguel and Bato had 2 each.
Of the 100 cases from Virac, barangays Francia (15 cases), Rawis (12), and
Sta. Elena (9) had the highest number while Salvacion had the highest
attack rate per 1000 population.
Dr Lareza said there was a marked increase in the number of suspect typhoid
cases during the period compared to previous years, with only 26 cases
admitted in 2006 and just 9 in 2005.
