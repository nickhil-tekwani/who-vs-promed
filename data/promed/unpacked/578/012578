Florida: second case of eastern equine encephalitis confirmed
-------------------------------------------------------------
Health officials confirmed another case of eastern equine encephalitis
(EEE) in Bay County, bringing the number of statewide cases to 2. A 3 year
old Orange County girl and a Bay County resident have been infected with
the disease, officials said on Fri 18 Jul 2003. These 2 cases are thought
to be Florida's first cases of EEE this year and perhaps only the second
and third nationally. An elderly Georgia man died in June 2003 after
contracting the mosquitoborne virus, which rarely strikes humans. [These
are actually the third and fourth cases this year; one other case has been
confirmed in Illinois (see below). - Mod.CP]
State officials would not release the 3 year old's identity or condition,
but acknowledged she remains in hospital with the disease. Her case
dovetails that of the Bay County resident, who spent 6 days in hospital as
a result of EEE virus infection. The Bay County Health Department would
only say that the Bay County person has been released.
EEE is commonly found in horses and is spread by mosquitoes. EEE infection
may include mild febrile symptoms, and can lead to coma or even death.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in
Atlanta, there have been only 153 confirmed human cases of eastern equine
encephalitis in the United States since 1964. EEE kills up to 50 per cent
of the people who contract it, compared with only about 10 per cent who die
after becoming infected with West Nile virus.

[The CDC figures suggest that on average there are only between 3 and 4
cases of EEE annually in the whole of the USA. The occurrence of these 2
cases in Florida and one each in Georgia and Illinois last month suggests
that there may be a greater risk of human EEE infection than in previous
years. - Mod.CP]
