During the last week of January 2000, ten cases of febrile illness with
differential diagnoses of dengue or leptospirosis were seen at the State
Hospital in Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia. Seven were admitted and
three were treated on an outpatient basis. The cases ranged in age from 5
to 55 years (median age of 17 years). There were 8 males and 2 females.
Four cases resided in Tafunsak, 3 in Utwa, 2 in Lelu and 1 in Malem. Most
cases (8/10) were febrile when seen. Other symptoms affecting more than one
patient were bodyache (5/10), headache (5/10), nausea/vomiting (5/10),
chills (4/10), loss of appetite (3/10), and dizziness (2/10). Other
symptoms noted were jaundice, sore throat, and malaise. Laboratory
specimens to assist the diagnosis are being collected.
