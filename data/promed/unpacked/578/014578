The influenza A (H1N1) virus has been detected in 2 foreign students
of the American University of Cairo while [another 140 students] have
been placed in quarantine, as we learnt from the medical services and
the establishment.

Police officers wearing masks were stationed in front of their
university dormitory in the Zamaleck area between the 2 arms of the
Nile. Nobody was allowed either to go in or to come out.

"Two students were confirmed positive for the H1N1 virus.
Consequently, the residence was placed under quarantine for 24
hours," a representative of the university declared, adding that a
3rd student who had fever, had been hospitalized for precautionary
motives. All the students shall be subjected to a screening test.

The 1st Egyptian case of influenza A was detected last Tuesday [2 Jun
2009]. It is a 12-year-old American girl who arrived on holiday in
Cairo. It is equally the 1st case detected in Africa.

[This is an update providing some details of the 1st case of
influenza A (H1N1) in Egypt and Africa as a whole. Despite all the
awareness of this novel virus raised in the last month in most
countries in the world, it seems the disease is spreading steadily
across the globe. This new outbreak is particularly concerning as
there is concurrent circulation of H5N1 virus in both human and
poultry populations, increasing the pathways by which a highly
transmissible and high mortality virus could evolve. ProMED-mail will
be interested in the sequence of events following the detection of
cases of influenza A (H1N1) in Egypt. - Mods.FE/PC]
