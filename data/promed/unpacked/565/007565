The Tennessee State Veterinarian is alerting horse owners after a case of Potomac horse fever was confirmed in Davidson County.

Potomac horse fever is caused by bacteria from freshwater snails which is spread in creeks or rivers where horses might drink. If exposed, the horses can suffer from colic, fever, and diarrhea.

State Veterinarian Dr. Charles Hatcher says another potentially deadly disease, strangles, was confirmed in Shelby County last month. While Potomac horse fever isn't found to be transmitted from horse to horse, strangles is contagious.

Strangles is an upper respiratory tract infections that causes lymph nodes to swell around the head and neck, possibly leading to coughing, difficulty swallowing, airway obstruction, or death. Other signs can include nasal discharge, fever, and depression.

Hatcher says "Potomac horse fever and strangles are serious infections, and if you notice any signs of illness in your horses, you should contact your veterinarian immediately." Hatcher advises says horse owners can help prevent diseases by regularly disinfecting stalls, water buckets, feed troughs and other equipment.

Standing water sources should also be eliminated and owners should avoid co-mingling your horses with unfamiliar horses.

[Potomac horse fever (PHF) is an acute enterocolitis syndrome producing mild colic, fever, and diarrhea in horses of all ages, as well as abortion in pregnant mares. The causative agent is _Neorickettsia risticii_. The infection of enterocytes of the small and large intestine results in acute colitis, which is one of the principal clinical signs of PHF. The disease is seen in spring, summer, and early fall and is associated with pastures bordering creeks or rivers. The epidemiology of PHF has been shown to involve a trematode vector. Sporadic disease caused by _N risticii_ has been reported in dogs and cats; cattle appear to be resistant to infection. PHF has been reported in many areas of the USA and Canada using an indirect fluorescent antibody test as evidence of exposure; however, recent studies indicate a high rate of false-positive titers with this test, and the true geographic range of distribution is not known. Isolation or detection of the causative agent from clinical cases of PHF using conventional cell culture or PCR assay has been reported only from California, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.

The clinical features of PHF are typified initially by mild depression and anorexia, followed by a fever of 102-107F (38.9-41.7C). At this stage, intestinal sounds may be decreased. Within 24-48 hr, a moderate to severe diarrhea, with feces ranging in consistency from that usually seen in cows to watery, develops in approximately 60% of affected horses. The onset of diarrhea is often accompanied by mild abdominal discomfort. Some horses develop severe signs of sepsis and dehydration. Clinical signs can be indistinguishable from those of _Salmonella_ and other infectious causes of enterocolitis.

A provisional diagnosis of PHF often is based on the presence of typical clinical signs and on the seasonal and geographic occurrence of the disease. A definitive diagnosis should be based on isolation or identification of _N risticii_ from the blood or feces of infected horses by cell culture or PCR.

Horses with PHF can be treated successfully with oxytetracycline (6.6 mg/kg, IV, bid), if given early in the clinical course of the disease. A response to treatment is usually seen within 12 hr. This is associated with a drop in rectal temperature, followed by an improvement in demeanor, appetite, and borborygmal sounds. If therapy is begun early, clinical signs frequently resolve by the 3rd day of treatment. Generally, antimicrobial therapy is recommended for no more than 5 days. In animals that exhibit signs of enterocolitis, fluids and NSAIDs should be administered. Laminitis is more common than in other causes of enterocolitis, and if it develops, is usually severe and often refractory to treatment. The overall case fatality rate is 5 percent-30 percent.

Several inactivated, whole-cell vaccines based on the same strain of _N risticii_ are commercially available. Although vaccination has been reported to protect 78 percent of experimentally infected ponies, it has been marginally protective in the field. Vaccine failure has been attributed to antigenic and genomic heterogeneity among the greater than 14 different strains of _N risticii_ isolated from naturally occurring cases. Furthermore, vaccine failure may also be due to lack of antibody protection at the site of exposure, because the natural route of transmission has been determined to be oral ingestion of the agent. Minimizing insect ingestion in stabled horses by turning off barn lights at night, which normally attract the insects, has been suggested.

While this disease is undeniably hard on the animal and any caring owner, it is not necessarily a death sentence to the animal as some other situations are. As with any illness, early detection of your animal being 'off his/her best', and early treatment is the best.

Potomac horse fever has several names, including equine monocytic ehrlichiosis, ditch fever, Shasta River crud, and equine ehrlichial colitis. You will note that some of these synonyms are descriptive of the water as well as the condition.

This disease is fairly wide spread, despite the name, and if the disease is your area, you may want to consult your veterinarian regarding vaccination of your animal. - Mod.TG
