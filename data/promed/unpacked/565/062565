Increased mumps incidence in the Netherlands: review of the possible
role of vaccine strain and genotype
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As reported in a recent issue of Eurosurveillance, a mumps outbreak
is ongoing in the Netherlands despite high vaccination coverage of
90-95 percent (1). The reported mumps cases are restricted to
geographic regions with a high percentage of residents who are
members of a religious community that rejects vaccination.
Consequently, two thirds of the mumps patients were not vaccinated.
However, also vaccinated individuals in these regions were affected
(1). Since 1987, the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) combination vaccine
produced by the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (NVI) is part of the
Dutch national immunisation programme and administered at the ages of
14 months and 9 years.

NVI's MMR vaccine contains the Jeryl Lynn mumps strain. The Jeryl
Lynn strain consists of 2 distinct viral isolates (JL-2 and JL-5).
Clinical studies have demonstrated 80-100 percent seroconversion
after a single dose of the Jeryl Lynn mumps vaccine (2).
Outbreak-based studies have shown an effectiveness of the Jeryl Lynn
mumps vaccine ranging between 63 percent and 96 percent, depending on
the number of vaccinations given (2-4). The Jeryl Lynn strain has
consistently been shown to be very safe (4,5). Table 1 shows an
overview of available mumps vaccine strains [Readers should access

The RIT 4385 mumps strain was derived from one of the 2 distinct
virus populations of the Jeryl Lynn strain. Comparative studies of
the RIT 4385 and Jeryl Lynn vaccines showed similar seroconversion
rates, although the geometric mean titre was significantly higher
among recipients of the Jeryl Lynn vaccine (2). Several vaccines
derived from the Urabe AM9 mumps strain were withdrawn from the
market due to an excessive number of cases of vaccine-associated
aseptic meningitis (6). The effectiveness of the Urabe vaccine ranges
between 54 and 87 percent (3,5). Another vaccine strain, Rubini, has
shown to be less potent with respect to effectiveness (2,3,5). For
this reason, the WHO (World Health Organisation) recommends that the
Rubini strain should not be used in national immunisation programmes
(2). The Leningrad-3 strain was developed in the former Soviet Union
and its protective efficacy has been estimated to be 91-99 percent
(2,4). Unfortunately, aseptic meningitis is a particularly common
event among recipients of this vaccine strain (4,7). Furthermore, it
has been reported that the Leningrad-3 strain can be transmitted
horizontally, causing symptomatic disease (7). Consequently,
Leningrad-3 vaccine has not gained much attention outside former
Soviet Union republics. The Leningrad-3 strain was further attenuated
in Croatia and was renamed L-Zagreb, which showed equivalent good
clinical protection (2). Unfortunately, an association with aseptic
meningitis has also been a matter of concern for the L-Zagreb strain
as well as symptomatic transmission of the vaccine virus (4,8,9).
Several other strains have been used for mumps vaccination, but most
of them on a limited scale. Therefore, little information is
available on their safety and effectiveness. Based on the safety and
efficacy data available for the vaccine strains, it can be concluded
that the Jeryl Lynn strain has the most favourable benefit-risk
profile.

A mismatch between the genotype of the circulating wild-type mumps
virus and the vaccine strain may influence the efficacy of the
vaccine. At present, the molecular epidemiology of mumps virus is
characterised by the co-existence of 13 different genotypes named A-M
(10). Those genotypes are defined on the basis of the most variable
part of the mumps virus genome, that is, the gene encoding the small
hydrophobic (SH) protein (10).

The vaccine strains currently available belong to a few different
genotypes [Readers should consult Table 1 in the original text to
view this information. - Mod.CP] Antigenic differences have been
observed between different genotypes, which result in incomplete,
cross-neutralisation (11). The antigenic differences were largest
between genotype A and genotypes B-D and G-I, which correlates well
with the relative phylogenetic distance between these genotypes [This
information is presented as a figure in the original text, in the
form of a phylogenetic tree of published sequences of 53 mumps virus
strains, based on the nucleotide sequence of the small hydrophobic
gene (SH)] (10,11).

At present, there is no clinical evidence that a genotype mismatch
leads to vaccine failure or may have epidemiological significance.
For example, both the mumps virus in the outbreak in the United
States (US) and Canada in 2005-2006 and the virus responsible for the
mumps outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2004-2005 belonged to
genotype G (4,12,13). Nevertheless, the MMR vaccine based on genotype
A (Jeryl Lynn) appeared to be effective during these outbreaks (12).
The mumps strains responsible for the current mumps outbreak in the
Netherlands and a previous outbreak in an international school in the
Netherlands in 2004 (14) were both of genotype D, whereas the mumps
vaccine strain (Jeryl Lynn) belongs to genotype A. Although
cross-protection after vaccination with genotype A might not be as
effective after infection with genotype D, no further transmission
took place during the outbreak in 2004. This suggests that
vaccine-induced (herd) immunity was high enough to prevent further
circulation of the mumps virus. On the other hand, it is striking
that the viruses responsible for reported mumps outbreaks belong to
genotypes that are phylogenetically distinct from the vaccine strains
used in the area of the outbreak [These data are presented as Table 2
in the original text. - Mod.CP] Therefore, the possibility that the
mumps virus might evolve under selection pressure from the vaccine
warrants surveillance of genotype distribution.

Finally, waning vaccine-induced immunity may contribute to a reduced
effectiveness of the vaccine. Previously, it was assumed that mumps
vaccination induces life-long immunity against mumps. However,
increasing evidence shows that vaccinated individuals and possibly
also naturally infected individuals, become more susceptible with
time after the last exposure to the mumps virus (4,12,13). Examples
are 2 mumps outbreaks that occurred among vaccinated students in an
international school in the Netherlands (14) and on college campuses
in the US (12). Therefore, stronger precautions should be taken to
avoid an increase in susceptible adolescents and adults that are more
at risk for mumps-related complications such as orchitis and
meningitis. Catch-up immunisations should be considered for
unvaccinated individuals and susceptible vaccinated people,
especially for those living in groups in close contact.

In response to a mumps outbreak, several countries such as Ireland
have decided to move the 2nd MMR vaccination forward to the age of 4
or 5 years (instead of between 9 and 14 years) to decrease the risk
of waning immunity between the 2 vaccinations. However, other
outbreaks show that waning immunity may also occur after the 2nd
vaccination. Moreover, by decreasing the age of the last MMR
vaccination, the susceptibility of women for rubella during their
fertile period may increase, which potentially leads to more cases of
congenital rubella syndrome.

Conclusion
----------
The 1st priority should be to avoid clustering of unvaccinated people
by making an effort to convince people to get vaccinated. Although a
number of mumps cases have occurred in vaccinated individuals, no
other mumps vaccine strain is available at present with equivalent or
better effectiveness and similar safety profile than the currently
used Jeryl Lynn strain. However, the impact of a genotype mismatch
between the wild-type virus and the vaccine virus on the mumps
vaccine effectiveness as well as the possibility of waning
vaccine-induced immunity should be further explored.

[The recent mumps cases in The Netherlands have been restricted to
geographic regions with a high percentage of residents who are
members of a religious community (anthroposophists) that rejects
vaccination. Two thirds of the mumps patients were not vaccinated,
however some vaccinated individuals in these regions were affected
also.

To what extent this is due to mismatch between the vaccine and the
genotype of the virus in circulation remains an open question. The
mumps component of the MMR triple vaccine is classified as genotype
A, whereas the virus in the outbreak in the Netherlands was genotype
D. Although genotype is defined only by the sequence of the SH
protein encoding region of the genome, antigenic differences have
been observed between different genotypes which result in incomplete
cross-neutralisation. These antigenic differences were largest
between genotype A and genotypes B-D and G-I (reference 1), which
correlates well with the relative phylogenetic distance between these
genotypes. - Mod.CP]
