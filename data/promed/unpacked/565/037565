The Ministry of Health and Social Services of Namibia officially declared an outbreak of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) on [6 May 2019] after reporting a number of cases from different regions of the country.

As of 15 May 2019, 7 suspected cases of CCHF were reported from 5 regions, including one laboratory confirmed case out of 7 samples tested and one death (case fatality ratio 14 percent).

The Ministry of Health and Social Services detail the cases/locations in the following press statement.

The World Health Organization says CCHF outbreaks have been recurrent in Namibia in the past 2 years, with cases reported from Omaheke, Omusati, and Kharas regions. The last recorded outbreak occurred in March 2018 in Kharas region, where one fatal confirmed case was reported.

The current outbreak arises in the context of a national drought emergency that can intensify the risk of transmission and geographical spread of the disease, with livestock movements from arid to less dry areas, if mitigating measures are not implemented in a timely manner.

Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a widespread disease caused by a tick-borne virus (_Orthonairovirus_) of the Nairoviridae family. The CCHF virus causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks, with a case fatality rate of 10-40%.

Animals become infected by the bite of infected ticks and the virus remains in their bloodstream for about one week after infection, allowing the tick-animal-tick cycle to continue when another tick bites. Although a number of tick genera are capable of becoming infected with CCHF virus, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_ are the principal vector.

The CCHF virus is transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission is possible.

Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widespread, tick-borne viral disease affecting humans. The disease is endemic in many regions, such as Africa, Asia, Eastern and Southern Europe, and Central Asia. Ixodid ticks, especially those of the genus _Hyalomma_, are both a reservoir and a vector for the virus. _Hyalomma_ ticks favour dry climates and arid types of vegetation, in areas with abundant small and large mammals that can support haematophagy and the different stages of the tick life-cycle. Environmental factors (such as climate) and human behaviour are critical determinants for the establishment and maintenance of CCHF endemicity within an area.

Given the wide distribution of the _Hyalomma_ vector, the numerous animals that can serve as hosts, and the favourable climatic and ecologic conditions in several European countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea, and African countries , it is possible that the incidence of CCHF may increase geographically over the region in the future (http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2017.02.018).

In healthcare settings, implementation of standard IPC (infection prevention and control) measures (standard, droplet, and contact precautions) with additional precautions to avoid aerosols can minimize transmission along with isolation and cohorting of patients. Effective risk communication remains central to prevent primary infection, especially among animal handlers, slaughter-house workers, and agriculture farmers. While there are examples of best practice, there is an urgent need to standardize risk communication with messages that are evidence-based and do not encourage stigma or unnecessary panic. - Mod.UBA]
