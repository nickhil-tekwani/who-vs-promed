[From a global perspective, OIE is now carrying reports of FMD in 4
continents - Europe, Asia, South America and Africa. Hopefully, the UK
experience and the one in Mongolia will be resolved without the type of
catastrophic damage seen in the Taiwan outbreak a few years ago. For both
of these countries, hit this week with a new outbreak, the magnitude of the
impact remains to be seen. - Mod.PC
