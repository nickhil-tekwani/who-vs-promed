Warning on fish disease
-----------------------
New South Wales recreational fishermen heading out for a spot of
Easter fishing are being warned to check their catch for signs of
Epizootic Ulcerative Syndrome or 'red spot disease.'

The fish must not be eaten or thrown back but euthanized, by quickly
removing the head and disposing in landfill. The disease strips the
slimy layer on the fish, allowing a fungus to develop and red lesions
and deep ulcers to appear.

Jane Frances, from the state's Department of Primary Industries, says
heavy rainfall after a long dry spell is responsible for the disease.
"Red spot is currently in a number of east coast estuaries," she says.
"The Clarence is one of those, the Manning, Hastings, we have
anecdotal reports from the Wallamba River and a tributary of Wallis
Lake. "Most recently we had confirmation from the Wiseman's Ferry area
of Hawkesbury River as well."

[My colleage AS has described the situation. Epizootic ulcerative
syndrome (EUS) is considered to be an infection with an oomycete
[fungus] known as _Aphanomyces invadans_ or _A. piscicida_. It is a
seasonal epizootic condition of great importance in wild and farmed
freshwater and estuarine fish; it has a complex infectious aetiology
and is clinically characterised by the presence of invasive
_Aphanomyces_ infection and necrotising ulcerative lesions typically
leading to a granulomatous response.

EUS is also known as red spot disease (RSD), mycotic granulomatosis
(MG), and ulcerative mycosis (UM). Recently, scientists proposed that
EUS should be re-named as epizootic granulomatous aphanomycosis or
EGA. At present, RSD, MG, UM, and EGA are synonyms for EUS. - Mod.TG
