It was recently suggested that scrapie can be eradicated through breeding
genetically "resistant" animals. The jury is still out on this issue
however.
Since genotyping has been available, all known clinical cases of scrapie in
the United States have been in genetically susceptible animals (denoted
QQ). However, it is unknown whether animals with a resistant genotype (QR
or RR) may be infected and is so contagious. It is possible that the
incubation period in theses animals is slow, such that they die of a
another disease before clinical signs of scrapie develop. 1
There was a survey done in New Hampshire by USDA for scrapie in cull ewes.
This is in the process of being written up and may contain more conclusive
information about scrapie and genetics.
Two good sources are:
1. L.A. Detwiler. Rev. Sci. Tech. OIE. 11(2): 491-537, 1992.
2. K.I O'Rourke. Allelic Frequencies of an Ovine Scrapie Susceptibility
Gene. Animal Biotechnology, 7(2): 155-162, 1996.
