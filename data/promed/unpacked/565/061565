The World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday [8 Sep 2022] said it is launching a USD 1.5 billion campaign, hopefully including a new vaccine, to eliminate outbreaks of bacterial meningitis across Africa by 2030. Meningitis vaccinations for more than 50 million children in Africa have been delayed amid the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting fears of a resurgence of the deadly disease.

In "a race against time," WHO regional director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti said that "a next generation" vaccine against meningitis will be rolled out in 26 African countries most affected by the disease. She said WHO hopes to authorize the vaccine by the 1st quarter of 2023, which would then enable donors to buy it for Africa. Moeti said the vaccine "has shown in clinical trials to be safe and effective against multiple forms of meningitis."

The vaccine could be rolled out next year [2023] and administered in widespread drives until 2030, when the WHO hopes to have stopped bacterial meningitis outbreaks in the continent of 54 countries and 1.3 billion people, she said. WHO estimated the plan could save more than 140 000 people every year -- but that depends on the shot's availability and health officials being able to administer it.

Although no new cases of meningitis A [meningococcal meningitis due to the bacterium _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A] have been recorded in the past 5 years on the continent due to a robust vaccination program, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and attendant restrictions have left "hundreds of millions" of Africans at risk, said Moeti.

Meningitis had "somewhat dropped off the radar" but could now take "an enormous toll on our countries, with COVID-19 threatening some of the extensive gains that had been made in the past," she said during a weekly briefing.

WHO says its reports show that meningitis control activities were reduced by 50% in 2020 compared with 2019 before the COVID-19 outbreak in Africa, although "a slight improvement" was recorded in 2021.

Children are most threatened according to WHO data that shows about half of meningitis cases and deaths occur in children under 5 years of age. More than 350 million people in 24 high-risk African countries received jabs of the vaccine since 2010, until the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic slowed down progress.

Meningitis is a serious infection of the membranes protecting the brain and spinal cord, according to WHO. It is caused by "many different pathogens" that include fungi, viruses and bacteria. Bacterial meningitis is the most deadly, according to the WHO. Carriers can spread the disease through respiratory or throat fluids via close and prolonged contact like kissing, sneezing or coughing or living close to an infected person. Meningitis has the potential to cause epidemics and it can lead to death within 24 hours, while 1 in 5 patients are left with lifelong disability after infection, according to the WHO.

Symptoms include headache, a stiff neck, sudden onset of fever, nausea or vomiting, feeling drowsy or confused, or developing a sudden dislike of bright light, according to the WHO.

[The African meningitis belt, which extends from Senegal to Ethiopia, historically had the highest incidence of _Neisseria meningitidis_ (Nm) disease with high endemic rates and periodic epidemics every 5 to 12 years with attack rates reaching 1000 cases per 100 000 population, mainly due to Nm capsular serogroup A (NmA) (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/global.html). The African meningitis belt consists of 26 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, CÃ´te d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda. The risk of meningococcal meningitis epidemics differs within and among these 26 countries.

This region of sub-Saharan Africa experienced a dramatic fall in NmA epidemics (http://millionssaved.cgdev.org/case-studies/eliminating-meningitis-across-africas-meningitis-belt) after mass preventive vaccination campaigns with NmA conjugate vaccine that targeted persons aged 1-29 years, beginning in December 2010 in 24 of the 26 target countries, followed by introduction into routine immunization programs in children aged 9-18 months in 12 of these countries (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/global.html). By the end of 2013, more than 153 million people were vaccinated in 12 countries (http://millionssaved.cgdev.org/case-studies/eliminating-meningitis-across-africas-meningitis-belt). Since 2017, no new cases of NmA meningitis have been reported from this region (https://www.afro.who.int/news/covid-19-threatens-elimination-deadly-form-meningitis-africa-more-50-million-children-miss).

However, the COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted meningitis prevention and control services, with disease surveillance, laboratory confirmation of cases and outbreak investigations all steeply declining. Based on reports from countries, WHO found that meningitis control activities were reduced by 50% in 2020 compared with 2019, with a slight improvement in 2021 (https://www.afro.who.int/news/covid-19-threatens-elimination-deadly-form-meningitis-africa-more-50-million-children-miss).

While no NmA case has been reported in Africa during the past 5 years, Nm serogroup W epidemics have emerged and spread across the continent since 2000; Nm serogroup X epidemics have occurred sporadically, and Nm serogroup C recently emerged in Nigeria and Niger (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5989898/). Outside the African meningitis belt, Nm serogroup B predominates in North Africa, while NmW followed by NmB predominate in South Africa (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5989898/). In Europe, the Americas, and Australia, serogroups B, C, and Y together account for a large majority of cases. However, public health officials have observed increasing numbers of serogroup W in some areas (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/global.html).

A new regional strategy for the African meningitis belt was launched on 8 Sep 2022 that sets out to "shore up diagnosis, surveillance, care, advocacy and vaccination to eliminate outbreaks, curb deaths by 70% and halve infections. WHO estimates that USD 1.5 billion will be required between now and 2030 to implement the plan, which if countries fully adopt will save more than 140 000 lives every year in the region and significantly reduce disability" (https://www.afro.who.int/news/covid-19-threatens-elimination-deadly-form-meningitis-africa-more-50-million-children-miss).

The news report above says WHO expects to authorize "a next generation" vaccine against meningitis that will be rolled out in 2023 in the African meningitis belt, but does not specifically describe this new vaccine. What is needed, though, is a low-cost, pentavalent conjugate vaccine covering Nm A, C, W, Y and X, which is currently in phase 1 clinical trial (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163445317301147). A further high-valency vaccine that is also in development is an NmACWY conjugate combined with the MenB subcapsular vaccine. - Mod.ML
