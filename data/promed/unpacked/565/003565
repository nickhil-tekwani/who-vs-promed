The virulent form of H5N1 bird flu virus is spreading in Romania where the
number of infected sites rose by 20 to 75, veterinary officials said.

In addition, 35 other possible sites were being investigated, the National
Veterinary Health Authority said.

The capital Bucharest was among the areas affected with the virus, which
reappeared at a poultry farm in Codlea 2 weeks ago, it said. The disease
was first detected here late in 2005.

The Romanian veterinary authorities in a statement blamed the latest spread
of the disease on migratory birds and the failure to take proper steps to
isolate the virus at the Codlea farm.

[The Romanian news agency Mediafax informed on 27 May 2006 the following:
"Romania's authorities received confirmation of 83 bird flu outbreaks
nationwide, said Marian Avram, president of the national sanitary
veterinary authority."

According to OIE statistics (last updated 24 May 2006), Romania has become
the 6th on the list of countries which have reported H5N1 in domestic
poultry since December 2003. The 10 leading countries on the list are the
following (in brackets - number of reported outbreaks): Vietnam (2312),
Thailand (1078), Indonesia (211), Turkey (176), Russia (121), Romania (88),
China, PRC (79), Nigeria (69), Ukraine (22) and South Korea (19). Of the
said countries, South Korea is the only one which eradicated the disease,
therefore currently regarded as free of HPAI. - Mod.AS]
