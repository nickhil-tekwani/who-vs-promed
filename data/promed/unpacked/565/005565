Problems of controlling bedbugs in Australia
---------------------------------------------
Bedbugs have also made a dramatic resurgence in Australia and have hit the
accommodation industry very hard. In a paper recently submitted to the
journal _Environmental Health_ by us, evidence for the increase takes into
consideration the following observations:
- Our Department of Medical Entomology, ICPMR, at Sydney's Westmead Hospital
has recorded an increase of 250 percent in the number of bed bug samples
submitted to our pathology service since the beginning of 2001 (note we are
the only NATA-accredited Medical Entomology pathology facility in Australia).
- The pest control industry has noted a major upturn in the number of bed bug
treatments, with one company reporting an increase of over 700 percent
during the last 4 years.
- The Australian Quarantine & Inspection Service has recorded a large
increase in bed bug interceptions since 1999.
Factors that may be encouraging the establishment and spread additional to
those listed in the previous ProMED-mail posting (see reference below)
include:
1. The recent introduction of the Tropical bed bug into Australia (Doggett,
Geary, Crowe, Wilson and Russell. 2003. Has the Tropical bed bug _Cimex
hemipterus_ invaded Australia? Environmental Health 3(4):80-82).
Presumably this species can colonise warmer areas less favourable for the
Common bed bug (_Cimex lectularius_).
2. The lack of experience in bed bug control amongst Pest Controllers,
especially knowledge of basic biology/ecology. We have seen multiple
treatments by different operators in the same premise without successful
control on many separate occasions. This was simply due to the failure to
treat all bed bug harbourages. It is not so much insecticide resistance
rather the lack of intelligent usage of insecticides that is the major issue
and the reason for most treatment failures. Concomitant to this is that bed
bug control is no longer taught in local pest control courses.
3. The failure to address the problem by the accommodation industry,
especially those in the budget end of the industry. We are aware of some
who do not acknowledge the problem treat it in a very ad-hoc manner and use
rooms knowing an infestation is present. Of course this runs the risk of
serious litigation as happened recently in the USA, whereby a hotel chain
was fined $US 382 000.

4. Physical construction of motel/hotel rooms. Treatment of infested rooms
can be almost impossible, as furnishings are often built in. This means
that insecticide treatment of all harbourages cannot be achieved. I believe
the bed bug resurgence will change how rooms are constructed in the future.
5. Increasing globalisation and cheap worldwide transport, which means
tourists are more likely to encounter bed bugs and transfer them around the
world.
These are just a few reasons for the recent upsurge in bed bugs, and
undoubtedly there are many other contributing factors. One of the major
issues facing us now is the serious lack of up-to-date information regarding
bed bug control, especially the efficacy of different insecticides, and this
needs to be urgently addressed [now].

[This post reports on the spread of the so-called tropical bedbug _Cimex
hemipterus_ to Australia and focuses on control problems, which will I am
sure be familiar to control officers in other countries. There is no
mention, however, of whether insecticide susceptibility tests have been
performed to determine whether bedbugs are showing resistance to any
compounds. Such information would be interesting.
Because bedbugs are not involved in the transmission of pathogenic
organisms to humans or animals, this thread is now closed. - Mod MS]
