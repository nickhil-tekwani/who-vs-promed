In the past month, there have been confirmed outbreaks of acute
diarrhea caused by rotavirus in countries of the region. The Dominican
Republic showed an increase of 25 percent in 9 provinces. In Mexico,
although the cases are distributed in 23 states, the largest
percentage of these occurred in Chiapas (30 percent) and Baja
California (13 percent) among others, while in Guatemala there were a
total of 4336 cases, of which 964 have been confirmed by laboratory
[testing].

Over the past month, we have been detecting the appearance of
confirmed outbreaks of acute diarrheal disease caused by rotavirus in
several countries of the region. In view of this situation, which is
occurring in the period of greatest viral circulation, the Pan
American Health Organization (PAHO) recommends strengthening
surveillance and implementing recommendations that contribute to
controlling the spread of the disease.

Rotavirus infection has universal distribution among children from 3
and 5 years old, although in general, all children are exposed to the
virus. It can also occur in adults, although it is less common and
less severe. Rotavirus infection is responsible for approximately 40
percent of all hospitalizations due to diarrheal diseases in children
under 5, which turns it into the main cause of diarrhea in this age
group. Incidence in developed and developing countries is similar.
There are currently 2 vaccines available [one currently withdrawn in
the USA, see ProMED-mail reference below - Mod.CP] for use among
children under one year of age: one monovalent and the other
pentavalent. These vaccines began to be incorporated into the national
vaccination series of the countries of the Americas in 2006, and 12
countries of Latin America currently use this vaccine in routine
vaccination series.

Rotavirus follows a seasonal pattern, and peaks occur mostly during
the winter months. In the Americas, sentinel hospital surveillance of
this disease has been implemented in several countries. Data show
that, for the Central American countries, the seasonal peak is
registered between December and March; and for the South American
countries between May and September.

Current Situation
----------------
The countries that have reported outbreaks are the Dominican Republic,
Guatemala, and Mexico.

Dominican Republic
From Epidemiological Weeks (EW) 1 to 6, and comparing the 2009 and
2010 periods, the cumulative number of cases of acute diarrheal
diseases (A09) show a 25 percent increase in 9 provinces, with the
most affected being La Altagracia, where there has been a 150 percent
increase. Cases have occurred in all age groups, with 44 percent of
all cases being concentrated in children under 5. The circulation of
rotavirus has been confirmed in samples obtained during the months of
January and February 2010. In the 1st month, out of a total of 89
samples processed, 6 percent tested positive to this agent. In
February 2010, the positivity rate was 5.4 percent (out of the 147
samples processed).

Actions and Response Taken by the Country: A technical note was sent
to the epidemiological services to initiate actions to verify alarms,
characterize cases, and determine sources and modes of transmission.
Implementation of 6 sentinel rotavirus surveillance sites was started
in health facilities located in the following provinces: Santiago,
Puerto Plata, Azua, San Pedro, Distrito Nacional, and Santo Domingo.
Resources are being mobilized for the purchase of laboratory supplies
used to diagnose rotavirus.

Guatemala
Since Epidemiological Week (EW) 1 through 8, Guatemala has reported a
total of 4336 cases, of which 964 have been laboratory confirmed, with
3 deaths (in Izabal, Jutiapa, and Peten Norte). The most affected age
group is children from 1 to 4 years, followed by infants less than a
year old and then by children from 5 to 9. The departments with the
greatest number of cases are Santa Rosa, Escuintla, Retalhuleu,
Izabal, and Huehuetenango. The Guatemalan authorities have reported
that prior to the period of high circulation, they had been carrying
out rotavirus prevention and control measures and that upon detecting
the outbreak, they alerted health services for diagnosis and timely
case management, including the distribution of oral rehydration salts.
In addition, at the community level, information and communication
activities were initiated aimed at reinforcing hygiene measures and
timely case consultation.

Mexico
According to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (Sistema
Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiologica / SINAVE), the number of
suspected cases of acute enteritis from rotavirus reported up to the
month of February 2010 exceeds the number of cases reported during the
same period from previous years. Although the cases are distributed
throughout 23 states, the greatest percentage has been reported in
Chiapas (30 percent), Baja California (13 percent), Oaxaca (12
percent), Tamaulipas (8 percent), San Luis de Potosi (5 percent), and
Sinaloa (5 percent). In the state of Chiapas, 1319 suspected cases of
rotavirus were reported between EW 1 and 9. Of the 897 samples
analyzed, the presence of rotavirus was confirmed in 393 of them.
Eight sanitary districts in Chiapas have reported suspected cases, and
rotavirus has been confirmed in 5 of them. The 1st case was reported
in Tapachula on 2 Jan 2010; and since 21 Jan 2010, a rising trend has
been reported, reaching the maximum numb!
er of cases on 9 Feb 2010. Since 15 Feb 2010, the trend has fallen
both in the number of suspected cases and in those confirmed. However,
the outbreak continues to be active; and suspected cases are still
being reported and are in the process of being diagnosed. Although
rotavirus cases have been found of different genotypes, the
Epidemiological Diagnostics and Reference Institute (Instituto de
Diagnostico y Referencia Epidemiologicos / InDRE) has identified a
high predominance of the genotype G9 e-type short, an emerging
genotype not included in the composition of the vaccine. A complete
vaccination series background was corroborated in 51 (13 percent) of
the confirmed cases. Based on the temporal and geographical
distribution, it is considered that this outbreak could have started
from a common source, although its origin has not been specified. In
224 cases, the consumption of non-chlorinated water has been
identified as a risk behavior. The Mexican health authorities issue!
d an alert for this event on 22 Feb 2010, strongly recommending re

[Rotavirus can cause illness ranking from asymptomatic infection in
children under the age of 3 months to severe diarrhea with dehydration
that can result in death. Rotavirus is a double-stranded segmented
genome RNA virus comprising 7 distinct groups designated A to G.
However, only groups A, B, and C infect humans, with group A being the
most important. The classification of rotaviruses into serotypes is
based on the antigenic specification of 2 proteins: VP4 (type G) and
VP7 (type P). The most important mode of transmission is fecal-oral.

The virus is highly infectious and very stable in the environment. The
primary mode of transmission is fecal-oral, although there have been
reports of low titers of virus in respiratory tract secretions and
other body fluids. Because the virus is stable in the environment,
transmission can occur through ingestion of contaminated water or food
and contact with contaminated surfaces.
