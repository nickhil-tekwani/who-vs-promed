Several cases of Q fever have been confirmed during the last 4 months
in Hallenberg (Germany) and neighbouring municipalities as well as in
Bromskirchen in Hesse. To date, a total of around 40 people have been
infected, of which about half live in Arnsberg (HSK) and in the
district Waldeck-Frankenberg.

The results of previous studies indicate that the infection
originates from sheep flocks, where the causative agent of Q fever was
confirmed. The pathogen has been confirmed in several flocks of sheep
from both "Lander" (Hesse and North Rhine-Westphalia) and is
transmitted to humans via direct contact or contaminated dust.

Immediately after the Arnsberg and the Waldeck-Frankenberg
authorities detected an increase of Q-fever infection in humans, the
competent national authorities became involved. The municipalities and
the districts of North Rhine-Westphalia and Hesse, Hochsauerland and
Waldeck-Frankenberg are working closely together. The veterinary
authorities have put restrictions upon the flocks of sheep shown to be
infected, have notified the owners and have imposed further protective
measures. The sheep will be vaccinated to reduce the shedding of the
pathogen. This requires that the vaccine, which is not currently
licensed in Germany, is temporarily approved by the competent local
authorities.

Q fever occurs worldwide and is a common bacterial infection mainly
transmitted by sheep, goats and cattle. Transmission takes place by
infectious dust or direct contact with the animals. Human-to-human
transmission is very unlikely.

The disease results in flu-like symptoms. An acute infection usually
begins with high fever, chills, muscle pain and severe frontal
headache. High risks have been established for pregnant women. Acute Q
fever can be treated with a specified antibiotic. Suspicion of a
possibility of Q fever infection should be notified to the family
doctor.

A health hazard outside Hallenberg and the other affected areas in
Hesse, where the disease was detected in sheep, is not to be
expected.

According to OIE's WAHID data, Germany reported 121 outbreaks of Q
fever in animals during 2010, all in cattle. Information from Germany
on human cases is available in the said source up to 2007; in 2006,
204 human cases were reported. Information for 2007 is qualitative.
