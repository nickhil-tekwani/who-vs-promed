Wyoming state veterinarian, Dr Jim Logan, has been notified by the Wyoming State Veterinary Laboratory and the National Veterinary Services Laboratory that there is a new case of brucellosis in a cattle herd in Teton County, which is in the Wyoming brucellosis designated surveillance area (DSA). Serologic testing at both laboratories has shown reactor level results on 5 animals from one herd. Further testing, including bacterial culture, will be conducted to confirm serology results.

Logan and assistant state field veterinarian, Dr Thach Winslow, are working with the owner of the infected cattle and are conducting an epidemiologic investigation. The herd with known _Brucella_ spp.-positive animals is under quarantine at this time. No sexually intact cattle can be moved from the quarantined premises until conditions of the quarantine release are met. At this time, Logan does not believe there are any additional herds epidemiologically linked to this case. This case is not related to the case found in early October [2018] in Park County, and there is no epidemiologic link between the 2 cases.

Brucellosis is a bacterial disease that can cause cattle, elk, and bison to abort their pregnancies, typically late term. All of Wyoming's brucellosis cases since 1988 have been determined to have been caused by transmission from infected wildlife to cattle or domestic bison. For more information, contact the Wyoming Livestock Board field office.

[This is a difficult situation for the rancher, as he is not able to move some cattle to market. However, as has been the case for the last many years (a decade or more?), it is part of the risk of being a rancher in this area.

Most ranchers believe that wildlife is responsible for this disease in their cattle, while most wildlife individuals believe that cattle is responsible for bringing the disease to wildlife. Either way, in a perfect world, treatment for both wildlife and domestic animals would be considered quite the advancement over test and slaughter.

We wish the workers of the Livestock Board great success in bringing this situation to a speedy close. - Mod.TG
