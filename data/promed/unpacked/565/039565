Two residents of Fairbanks, Alaska have been diagnosed with tularemia, a
potentially fatal bacterial infection more commonly found in animals.
Alaska Department of Fish and Game veterinarian Kimberlee Beckmen learned
of the outbreak from state public health authorities late last week.

The disease can be transmitted to humans from snowshoe hares, and the hare
population has been high in the interior. It's unclear how the Fairbanks
residents contracted it.

Beckmen says people are usually infected through the skin by handling sick
hares, but they can also get it when bitten by ticks, flies, or mosquitoes
that fed on sick hares.

A Fish and Game spokeswoman says the Fairbanks patients were treated with
antibiotics and are doing well.

[Tularemia is typically found in animals, especially small mammals such as
voles, mice, rodents, rabbits, and hares. _Francisella tularensis_ is found
in a wide range of animal hosts and is capable of surviving for weeks at
low temperatures in water, moist soil, or decaying plant and animal matter.
Although hundreds of differing vertebrates and invertebrates can be
infected with the tularemia bacillus, no more than a dozen or so are
important in its ecology. Humans become infected through a variety of
mechanisms including bites of infected arthropods (mosquitoes, ticks,
deerflies), handling infected or dead animals, ingesting contaminated food
or water, and inhaling aerosols of bacteria. The type of exposure will
dictate the form of the disease manifestation with cutaneous exposures
usually resulting in the glandular or ulceroglandular forms. The type of
disease in these Alaskan cases is not stated.

ProMED-mail posted an alert (20041008.2760, see below) in October 2004
regarding hamsters from a Canadian pet distributor that were found to be
infected with type B tularemia as well. No human cases were reported.

Tularemia in humans is generally a rural disease and occurs naturally
throughout much of North America and Eurasia. The type B strain (_F.
tularensis_ biogroup palearctica) is the dominant strain in Eurasia,
whereas both biogroups (type A is biogroup tularensis) are found in the
USA. Type A is said to be more virulent than type B.

Although not generally transferable from person to person, the infectious
dose of _F. tularensis_ is quite low, and the organism is listed among the
category A bioterrorism agents.

According to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, during the period 2000-2006, a total of 873 cases of human
tularemia were reported in the USA. In the same period, there were a total
of only 3 cases reported in Alaska, with annual reports of no more than one
per year, although the disease is likely underreported. See
<http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/Surveillance/Tul_CasesbyState.html> for the
full table of number of cases reported each year by state, 2000-2006. The
largest numbers were from the south-central part of the USA, with Missouri
(172), Arkansas (123), and Oklahoma (79) leading the list. - Mod.LL]
