Massachusetts: 2 deaths linked to eastern equine encephalitis virus infection
-----------------------------------------------
A 5 year old girl from Halifax and an 83 year old man from Kingston have
died after being diagnosed with the mosquitoborne eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE), bringing the number of human EEE cases in Massachusetts
this year [2005] to 3.
The girl became ill on 26 Aug 2005 and died on 4 Sep 2005. according to
public health officials. Lab tests later identified the disease, although
the results of a final test are pending. The man became ill on 21 Aug 2005
and died 5 days later. Tests confirmed the disease a week after he died.
It was not clear how or when the 2 victims contracted EEE virus, said Dr Al
DeMaria, Department of Public Health Director of Communicable Disease
Control. He released few other details and declined to identify them by
name, saying the department needed to protect their privacy.
Last week [final week August 2005], the health department announced that a
63 year old Duxbury woman had contracted the state's 1st human case of EEE
virus infection this summer. The dangerous virus also turned up in 4 New
Hampshire residents in recent weeks; none have died. The Duxbury woman was
the 1st case diagnosed and reported, but she became ill [only] on 26 Aug
2005, after the man from Kingston had already developed symptoms. She
remains in hospital, in a serious condition.
Last year [2004], 4 human cases of EEE were confirmed in Massachusetts, 2
of them fatal.
Public health officials said residents can take steps to protect themselves
from the disease by trying to avoid mosquito bites until the 1st frost. As
of last week [final week August 2005], the state had tested around 120 000
mosquitoes for EEE virus, and only 15 of those insects tested positive for
the virus.
The Massachusetts Department of Public Health has also confirmed reports of
EEE in 2 horses, one in Haverhill and one in Wrentham. This season [2005],
both EEE virus and West Nile virus have been detected in mosquitoes and
birds in a number of communities across the state. EEE can be transmitted
to humans through mosquito bites, and August and September are typically
the months when it emerges in humans. Symptoms range from a mild flu-like
[febrile] illness to inflammation of the brain, coma and death.
The disease tends to appear in cycles, DeMaria said. The last outbreak was
in 1990; with the [4] cases last year [2004] and the 3 cases this year,
public health officials believe that they are in a "high part of the
cycle," DeMaria said. "We were concerned that there might be more cases
this year than last year. There was a lot of discussion; there was a lot of
planning and mosquito control efforts that went into place ... hopefully we
won't have any more," he said.
The disease kills around 35 per cent of the people who contract it,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), making
it one of the more serious mosquitoborne diseases in the United States.
Some 35 per cent of those who survive it have mild to severe neurological
problems. There have only been about 200 confirmed cases in the US since
1964, according to the CDC. Massachusetts is among the states that has the
largest number of cases; others are Florida, Georgia, and New Jersey. There
is no licensed vaccine for humans.

[EEE is endemic in North America along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts. In
northern regions, human cases occur in late summer up to the time of the
1st frosts, whereas cases of infection may occur throughout the year
further south. In North America, the virus is maintained in freshwater
marshes, the habitat of the mosquito _Culiseta melanura_. This mosquito
feeds almost exclusively on birds (rarely on small mammals and reptiles)
and is an amplifying host for the virus in spring and summer. A secondary
epidemic cycle then occurs in areas adjacent to salt marshes involving
other species of birds and _Aedes_ spp. mosquitoes. These mosquitoes
transmit the virus to horses and, less frequently, to humans, both of which
are dead-end hosts for the virus. In endemic areas, equines can be
protected by vaccination, but there is no vaccine approved for
administration to humans. It is not entirely clear how the virus survives
from year-to-year in endemic areas, and other factors may determine the
frequency of exposure of horses and humans to EEE virus infection. - Mod.CP]
