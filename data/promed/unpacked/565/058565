Wheat blast or 'brusone' is a new wheat disease. It is responsible
for 5 to 100 percent of wheat yield loss in regions of South America
and has the potential to spread. It was identified for the 1st time
in 1985 in southern Brazil, from where it quickly spread to
neighboring countries. In 1989 it caused serious damage in the wheat
fields of Paraguay. In the lowlands of Bolivia, it was responsible
for a loss of 90 000 hectares [222 000 acres] of wheat between 1997
and 2000. In 2007, the disease was seen in summer-sown experimental
wheat trials in Chaco, Argentina, and although researchers in Uruguay
have not observed the disease in wheat, they have found the fungus on
barley. A 2009 outbreak cut Brazilian wheat production by up to 30 percent.

Of great concern is that chemical control of wheat blast may not be
working. To date, there is a lack of cultivars resistant to wheat
blast, and only limited tolerance can be found. Climate change is
adding to the problem. Wheat blast needs high temperatures of about
24 to 28 deg C [75.2-82.4 deg F] and long periods of rain. Changes in
rainfall may create conditions favorable to wheat blast in other
parts of the world such as South Asia or Africa.

[Wheat blast is an emerging disease in South America caused by a
fungus closely related to the rice blast pathogen _Magnaporthe
grisea_. Initially, it was thought to be a fungal strain, which
crossed from rice to wheat, but it is now considered more likely to
be a different species originating from local wild grasses. A
re-classification of species has been suggested with the wheat
pathogen to be named _M. grisea_ and the new name _M. oryzae_
assigned to the rice blast fungus. Wheat blast is now considered a
new disease caused by a distinctly different pathogen and sequencing
studies are being carried out to determine exact genetic differences
between the wheat and rice fungi.

Blast symptoms on wheat and barley include bleaching of ears,
shrivelled kernels, and no seed production at all for severe
infections. Yield losses are reported to average 40 to 50 percent and
wheat production in some affected areas has ceased. Humid and warm
conditions favour disease development, but the life cycle of the
fungus is still unknown. Spread of the rice pathogen occurs with
infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect activity),
water, and wind, and it is likely that the wheat pathogen is spread
in similar ways. Although wheat blast can be controlled with
fungicides, correct application requires training and is often too
expensive for smallholders in developing countries. Resistant
cultivars are not yet available, but breeding programmes are being
established in the Americas.

More than 50 species of grasses and sedges can be affected by these
related fungi. Furthermore, they appear to be highly variable and
this favours the emergence of new strains with increased virulence
and extended host range. Since rice blast is one of the most
destructive diseases of rice worldwide, potential epidemics of wheat
blast in subtropical regions of Southeast Asia, Africa, or the
Mediterranean are considered a threat to global food security.
