A bobcat attack was caught on camera in Anthem this weekend. [Male JG] posted the video to Facebook and provided the footage to ABC15. JG said the bobcat ran after and attacked a dog. A witness saw what was happening and jumped out to help.

[Male SV] was bitten by the bobcat as he got the bobcat off the dog. His hand was punctured, his thumb fractured, and his arm clawed. "Once I saw the cat spring on top of the dog, and the owner was trying to pull the dog back, I said, 'Someone else has to help out here,'" said SV.

The Arizona Game and Fish Department said the bobcat tested positive for rabies. They said the last mammal that tested positive for rabies in Maricopa County was a mountain lion back in 2012. They added that this is a rarity, and they are investigating where the bobcat contracted rabies from, even though at the moment, wildlife officials believe it could have contracted rabies from a bat. They said the bobcat incident does not "imply we have a problem in the Valley" and it is "not a reason to panic."

SV received a rabies and tetanus shot.

There was no shortage of Good Samaritans when the attack happened. When SV jumped out of the car to help, his adrenaline was going, but so was his car. That's when JG, who recorded video of the incident, ran over to stop the runaway car after SV inadvertently left it in gear.

According to game and fish officials, an McCoy deputy found the bobcat in a storm drain away from the crowd. A field supervisor with the game and fish department authorized the deputy to shoot the bobcat. The only way to test an animal for rabies is to test brain tissue, so the animal needs to be killed, according to Amy Burnett, a public information officer with the game and fish department said.

SV said, besides the fright, the dog only suffered a scratch. It was current on its shots, but will still need to be quarantined for an unspecified amount of time, according to Burnett.

ProMED reported 2 rabid bobcat events in Arizona in 2010:
Rabies, wildlife - USA: (AZ) 20100101.0013 (on 1 Jan 2010)
Rabies, wildlife - USA (06): (AZ) 20100425.1339 (on 25 Apr 2010)

For a map of the rabies virus strains in the various states, go to: https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/publications/2015-surveillance/2015-us-map.html. According to this map, Arizona has skunk and fox strains. According to the Arizona Department of Health Services http://www.azdhs.gov/preparedness/epidemiology-disease-control/rabies/index.php#about in Arizona, the principal rabies hosts are bats, skunks, and foxes. These animals carry their own distinct rabies virus variants or "strains". When rabies activity within these animal groups increases, rabies can "spillover" into other mammal species, such as bobcats, coyotes, javelina, cats, dogs, horses, cows, etc. Every year, approximately 30 people are exposed to rabid animals in Arizona. People who are exposed must receive vaccine and anti-rabies serum treatment to prevent infection.

In Arizona, bats present the most common source of rabies exposures to humans because rabid bats often fall to the ground where they are easily accessible to people and pets. Bats are generally not aggressive. Exposure to rabid bats usually occurs when people pick up or handle a sick or dead bat. Other rabies exposures occur when people try to approach or feed wild animals, or in some cases, are attacked by rabid animals such as foxes, bobcats, and skunks. Most rabies exposures can be avoided by simply leaving bats and other wild animals alone. The last documented human rabies death in Arizona was in 1981.

All bite or contact exposures should be reported immediately to local animal control or health officials.

Reports of suspect rabies infection in livestock and the quarantine of livestock that bite humans should be handled by calling the Arizona State Veterinarian's Office at (602) 542-4293. - Mod.MHJ]

[The report notes that the victim received rabies and tetanus shots. Given that he reported being bitten and had puncture wounds on his hand presumed to be from the bobcat, let's hope the medical provider also administered human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) at the site of the bite wound(s) if needed. Current post-exposure prophylaxis recommends HRIG (https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html) in addition to 4 doses of vaccine on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 if the victim was not previously vaccinated for rabies. Previously vaccinated individuals receive 2 doses of vaccine on days 0 and 3. - Mod.JH
