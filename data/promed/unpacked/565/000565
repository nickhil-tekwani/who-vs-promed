Cassava disease ravages gardens
-------------------------------
The cassava fungal disease has broken out in Kiboga [Central Region]
devastating over 60 acres [24 ha] of cassava gardens. The disease has
mostly affected villages in Rwamatta Sub-County.

Godfrey Musisi Sebulime, Kiboga District agricultural officer, says
he learnt of the strange disease when he was approached by the
affected farmers. He dispatched a team of researchers from the
district and the National Agricultural Research Organization, who
classified the disease as the cassava fungal infection.

A farmer says that he first noticed the disease when his cassava
plants turned yellow, about 2 weeks ago. He says that when he went to
harvest the cassava roots he found them rotten. A cassava plant with
the cassava fungal infection presents with dark spots on the leaves,
rotten roots, and boom of flies during the day.

Musisi attributes the outbreak in Kiboga to effects of climate
changes, some weeds and poor crop spacing. He has advised farmers to
plant resistant cassava varieties and improve the spacing of their
crops and drainage in gardens.

[At least 20 fungal pathogens are known to cause root rot of cassava,
including for example species of _Fusarium_, _Phythophtora_,
_Pythium_, and the parasitic mushroom _Laetiporus sulphureus_
(synonym _Polyporus sulphureus_), which is causing serious problems
in parts of Africa. The recommendation above to improve drainage of
fields can be expected to assist with control of most fungal root
diseases.

A viral root rot caused by _Cassava brown streak virus_ as well as
cassava mosaic disease caused by a number of species of _Begomovirus_
is also affecting the crop in East Africa, including Uganda.
