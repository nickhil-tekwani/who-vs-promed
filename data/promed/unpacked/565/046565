West Nile Virus in Canada - WHO Update 8
----------------------------------------
As of Tue 5 Nov 2002, Health Canada has reported a total number of 121
human cases of West Nile virus infection: 65 suspected cases, 56 confirmed
cases, including 1 death. One confirmed case is resident in the province of
Alberta, one suspected case and 7 confirmed cases are resident in the
province of Quebec, and the remaining 64 suspected cases and 48 confirmed
cases are resident in the province of Ontario. See previous report:
<http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/n2002/october/30aoctober2002.html>
One additional death in a confirmed case and 5 deaths in suspected cases
are under investigation in Ontario to determine whether these can be
attributed to West Nile virus infection. The one confirmed case in Alberta
and one confirmed case in Ontario likely acquired infection while
travelling in the United States, whereas all other cases acquired their
infection within their home province.
