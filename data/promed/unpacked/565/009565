Public Health Dispatch: Update: Outbreak of Acute Febrile Respiratory
Illness Among College Students --- Acapulco, Mexico, March 2001
-------------------------------------------------------------------
On 30 Mar 2001, CDC was notified by the Pennsylvania Department of Health
of an acute febrile respiratory illness characterized by fever, chills, dry
cough, chest pain, and headache among college students who traveled to
Acapulco during March 2001. Initial laboratory testing indicated that most
students had histoplasmosis, an infection caused by the soil-inhabiting
fungus, _Histoplasma capsulatum_. While in Acapulco, most ill students had
stayed at the Calinda Beach Hotel. This report updates the investigation of
the outbreak and presents possible evidence of ongoing transmission (1).
As of 1 May 2001, 44 colleges in 22 states* and the District of Columbia
have reported 229 students with acute febrile respiratory illness defined
by fever for at least 3 days and one or more of the following symptoms:
cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, or headache. Laboratory testing of
serum specimens from many of these students is ongoing to confirm the cause
of illness. Confirmation of histoplasmosis ideally requires testing of
acute- and convalescent-phase serum specimens using complement fixation and
immunodiffusion methods (2).
To determine where the infection may have been acquired, a cohort study was
conducted among students who stayed at 3 different hotels in Acapulco
during the first 2 weeks of March. A total of 109 randomly selected
students were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire about
symptoms, daily activities, and environmental exposures while in Acapulco.
31 students stayed at the Calinda Beach Hotel, and 78 stayed at other
hotels; 58 (53%) were women, and the median age was 21 years (range: 17-25
years). Univariate analysis indicated that having stayed at the Calinda
Beach Hotel was significantly associated with illness (22 [71% of 31
versus four [5% of 78; risk ratio [RR=13.8; p less than 0.001). Other
activities (e.g., visiting clubs and restaurants) were not associated with
illness.
During April, CDC and the Mexico Ministry of Health conducted a joint
investigation of the Calinda Beach Hotel and surrounding areas to determine
potential sources of _H. capsulatum_ (e.g., construction sites and bird and
bat roosts). No sources at the hotel or in its vicinity were identified.
Reports of illness in travelers who visited the hotel during April are
continuing to be obtained and investigated. To identify specific sources of
infection, a cohort study is being conducted among college students who
stayed at the hotel during March. This study involves administration of a
detailed questionnaire about activities in and near the Calinda Beach Hotel
and collection of serum specimens from ill and non-ill visitors.
Environmental samples were collected from areas in and around the hotel
that were frequented by the students; testing of these environmental
specimens for _H. capsulatum_ is difficult and requires intraperitoneal
mouse inoculation. CDC is awaiting results of the cohort study to determine
which samples to test.
On 3 May 2001, CDC was notified about 2 cases of histoplasmosis in a couple
from California who had traveled to Acapulco during 9-16 Apr 2001 and had
stayed at the Calinda Beach Hotel. The couple, both aged 26 years, had
onset of symptoms consistent with acute histoplasmosis 8 days after
returning from Acapulco. Urine antigen test for histoplasmosis (3) at the
Histoplasmosis Reference Laboratory (Indianapolis, Indiana) was positive
for both persons. Although this test is not sensitive for diagnosis of
acute pulmonary histoplasmosis, the test is very specific. These cases
suggest ongoing transmission of histoplasmosis associated with the hotel.
Visitors to the Calinda Beach Hotel should be aware of the risk for
histoplasmosis and should contact their physicians if they develop
symptoms. Physicians should contact CDC's Mycotic Diseases Branch,
telephone (404) 639-1299 or e-mail: <zqg9@cdc.gov>. Until further
information is available, U.S. visitors to Acapulco are advised to avoid
the area of the Calinda Beach Hotel.
