[The total number of cases with confirmed MERS-CoV infection is now up to 175 including 27 deaths with a reported case fatality rate of 15.4 percent. Of the 3 newly confirmed cases, 2 are most likely 4th generation cases. The 3rd case is not clear as the dates of exposure to the Samsung emergency room do not correspond with the earlier dates when case #14 was in the emergency room. While there are cases continuing to be confirmed, they are at a much slower pace than earlier, and dates of contact seem to be in the 1st week of June, suggesting that transmission is slowing down. According to a media report, 2 of the 3 newly confirmed cases were individuals who were in isolation as suspected cases preceding the confirmation of MERS-CoV infection (see http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/business/2015/06/23/21/0504000000AEN20150623001700320F.html).

Noteworthy is that one of the recovered cases announced today is case #14 - one of the "superspreaders".

The total number of individuals who have been or are being followed by the MOH in quarantine is indicative of a massive effort on the part of the MOH - 2805 currently under quarantine and 10 718 released following 14 days of quarantine.

MERS-CoV - Regional situation update as of 15 Jun 2015
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Eastern Mediterranean Region: situation update
---------------------------------------
A total of 212 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) including 95 deaths (CFR: 44.8 percent) were reported from the countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region between [1 Jan 2015 to 15 Jun 2015]. The majority of the cases were reported from Saudi Arabia (201 cases) followed by the United Arab Emirates (4 cases), Qatar (3 cases), Oman (3 cases), and the Islamic Republic of Iran (1 case).

Compared to 2014, there has not been any substantial increase in numbers of reported cases, and the epidemiological characteristics of the cases reported in 2015 do not show any significant difference when compared with cases reported during the same period in 2013 and in 2014.

Males and the median age group of 50-59 years continue to be at the highest risk for acquiring infection.

Compared to 2014, although the cases have not registered a significant increase, small sized hospital outbreaks continue to be reported from Saudi Arabia and remain a major concern. Since epidemiological week no. 16 [week of 19-25 Apr 2015, consistent with the presumed start date of 20 Apr 2015 - Mod.MPP], a nosocomial outbreak involving 2 hospitals in Hofuf city of Al-Ahsa of Eastern Province has been reported. A total of 31 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV including 14 deaths (CFR: 45.1 percent) were reported from this outbreak. The date of symptom onset of the last case reported from this outbreak was [2 Jun 2015].

[In looking at the data for the region, one is struck by the reported case fatality rate of 44.8 percent when compared with the overall case fatality rate reported by WHO of 35.4 percent (see MERS-CoV (73): South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Thailand, WHO, RFI 20150620.3453094). One can't help but wonder how many milder cases are being missed and attributed to other febrile respiratory diseases, so that it's the severe respiratory diseases that are tested for the MERS-CoV.

This update provides the 1st official data on the ongoing hospital based outbreak in Hufoof. According the information above, the outbreak began the week of 20 Apr 2015 and involves 2 hospitals. Reviewing specific information on individual cases, the case that occurred on 20 Apr 2015 (the "index case") of the hospital-based outbreak had a history of frequent exposure to camels and sheep. As of 22 Jun 2015, there have been a total of 38 cases reported from Hufoof since 20 Apr 2015, including 18 deaths (reported case fatality rate of 47.4 percent).

Patients travelling from MERS-affected countries for medical services in Thailand, through agency arrangements, will be required to undergo tests for the virus one week ahead of their entry.

"The screening measure is part of efforts to control the spread of MERS," Dr Supamit Chunsuttiwat of the Disease Control Department said yesterday [22 Jun 2015].

Records show Thailand receives more than a million medical visits from foreigners each year.

Authorities believe the MERS situation in Thailand is under control. There has been just one confirmed case of Middle East respiratory syndrome, and this man from Oman is recovering. "Authorities have successfully contained the infection, and no new case was found of a MERS situation in Thailand," Public Health Ministry deputy permanent secretary Wachira Pengjuntr said. He added that there were 163 people on the MERS watch list as they had had contact with the Omani patient. "The number has dropped from 176 a day earlier because 13 of them have left the country," he explained. [Whee have they gone and are they in quarantine wherever they may have travelled to? - Mod.MPP]

Speaking at a press conference yesterday [22 Jun 2015], Wachira said the condition of the sole MERS patient in Thailand was improving. He had no fever and was able to eat by himself; 3 of his relatives had shown no illness. The test results of 3 relatives have not confirmed the infection, but they were all quarantined in the standard disease-control facility at Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute.

Disease Control Department deputy director Opart Karnkawinpong said the department had found 163 people who had had contact with the patient, and the condition of all of them had been monitored at their residences for 14 days.

Wachira said: "We have successfully contained the disease in Thailand, and there is only a small chance of wide infection. The situation in South Korea also has been improving as no new cases were identified yesterday [while the calendar date of "yesterday" in this media report is 22 Jun 2015, the day when there were 0 cases reported was 21 Jun 2015], and the number of people who had contact with the infected had dropped to around 4000 from 6000 a day earlier."

Despite the good signs, he said the Public Health Ministry would continue to enforce strict disease-control measures. "Private hospitals have been instructed to follow the disease-control procedures strictly according to the Communicable Diseases Act 1980. If they find a suspected MERS case, they have to inform the Public Health Ministry immediately," he said.

He also said the ministry had discussed with the Defence Ministry, Foreign Affairs Ministry, Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department, Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, and other relevant agencies plans to cope with a possible outbreak in the future.

"More disease-control facilities will be allocated, as currently the ministry can quarantine only around 100-200 people who have had close contact with a MERS patient. We are discussing with the army and private hospitals how to facilitate these people if there is a contagious-disease outbreak in the future," he said.

He said new regulations to oblige people who have had contact with a patient to enter the disease monitoring were also being considered. If the new regulations pass, anyone who avoids disease quarantine will face legal punishment.

Health Service Support Department director-general Dr Boonruang Triruangworawat said hospitals could not deny treatment to walk-in patients even if they were suspected of having MERS.

He said that during the past week, at least 2 private hospitals were found to have flagged taxis and sent suspected patients on to Bamrasnaradura Infectious Diseases Institute simply because they came from MERS-hit countries.

"We have issued warnings to the staff of these 2 hospitals because such actions are against the law," he said.

[An important piece of information in the above media report is that laboratory tests ruled out MERS-CoV infection in accompanying family members of the MERS-CoV infected individual from Oman.

The various possible control measures mentioned in the media report are a reflection of a country coming to terms with more than one million "medical tourists" annually and potential impact on public health of the country in keeping with the realization that we live in a global village. Mandatory quarantine with legal consequences, pre-screening for MERS-CoV infection pre-departure from country (which won't detect individuals who are in the incubation period of the disease) are 2 of the measures discussed in this article. It raises the issue on the need for a point of care accurate test that could rapidly identify MERS-CoV infections.

Korea was unlucky, as the index case in the outbreak was misdiagnosed and, to add to the problem, was also a superspreader. This repeated itself with other misdiagnosed cases and another major superspreader. Thailand was lucky, early suspicion and diagnosis, and the case was not a superspreader (although it's too early to conclude no secondary spread, as he's only been in country since 15 Jun 2015, less than an incubation period.
