Ethiopia. Plant Pathology Journal 9, 23-30. DOI: 10.3923/ppj.2010.23.30]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A 2 year survey was conducted to determine incidence and severity of
sorghum anthracnose in different sorghum growing regions in Ethiopia.
A total of 487 fields in 49 districts were surveyed in each of the
2005 and 2007 production season.

Incidence of sorghum anthracnose was assessed as the percentage of
plants with visible symptoms in a field, and anthracnose severity was
evaluated as the percentage of leaf area with symptoms. Also, the
relationship of the incidence and severity of the disease to the
altitude of the fields and weather conditions were determined.

Results from the 2 years survey revealed that sorghum anthracnose is
present in most (84 percent) of the survey districts. However, both
incidence and severity of the disease varied significantly among the
survey areas. Anthracnose incidence ranged from 0 to 77 percent and
severity of the disease varied between 0 and 59 percent on average
for the two years.

The 2 year average anthracnose severity classes ranged from trace
(less than 5 percent) to severe (up to 59 percent) and the disease
was generally more severe in the Southwest and South regions.
However, some districts in the East and North Ethiopia also had
fields with severe anthracnose infection. It was also found that the
prevailing weather conditions especially rainfall have a significant
impact on both anthracnose incidence and severity.

[Domesticated sorghum varieties (_Sorghum bicolor_) are vital for
food security in many developing countries. Anthracnose is one of the
most important sorghum diseases limiting grain production in most of
the areas where the crop is grown. Yield losses in susceptible
cultivars may be more than 50 percent. The disease is caused by the
fungus _Colletotrichum sublineola_, which has recently been
re-classified as a separate species. It was previously considered a
strain of _Glomerella graminicola_ (previously _Colletotrichum gr._),
which causes anthracnose on maize.

The disease affects leaves, stems, and grains. Symptoms depend on the
level of susceptibility of host cultivars and may include dark spots
on leaves and leaf sheaths, stalk rot, reduced panicles, and
discolouration of seed. Rapid and severe yield loss can result from
panicle and peduncle infections. Infected seed may show reduced
germination rates and emerging seedlings are often affected by leaf
blight. It is being debated whether different strains of the fungus
may be responsible for symptoms on the different plant parts.

The pathogen survives between crops on plant debris left in the
field. It can be spread with plant material including seed, soil, by
mechanical means, and human activities. Disease management includes
deep plowing of crop residues, crop rotation, and fungicide
treatments of crops and seed. However, especially in developing
countries, host plant resistance is often the only practical means of
control. While resistant sorghum cultivars and hybrids are being
developed, these may be unsuitable for countries like Ethiopia where
specific landraces are essential for smallholder requirements.
