United Nations chemical-weapons inspectors announced that they are investigating whether Turkish forces used chemical weapons in their invasion of Syria, the Guardian reported Friday [18 Oct 2019].

The Kurds have accused Turkey of using white [phosphorus] during their recent incursion into northeastern Syria. The Kurdish Red Crescent claims 6 patients, including civilians and military members, have been hospitalized in the city of Hasakah due to burns from "unknown weapons."

The organization could not confirm chemical-weapons usage, saying it was "working together with our international partners to investigate this subject." However, a British chemical-weapons expert who examined a photo of one of the victims said the burns on the victim were likely from a chemical weapon.

"The most likely culprit is white phosphorus," said Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of Britain's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear regiment. "It is a horrific weapon and has been used repeatedly during the Syrian civil war; unfortunately its use has become increasingly normalized."

White [phosphorus] can be used legally as a smokescreen or as an incendiary at night to illuminate the battlefield and is held by militaries worldwide. The use of white [phosphorus] as a weapon, however, is illegal under international law because it causes severe burns upon contact with skin.

While some Kurdish officials alleged Turkey used "unconventional weapons" in Syria, Turkey denies this. "It is a fact known by everyone that there are no chemical weapons in the inventory of the Turkish armed forces," said Turkish defense minister Hulusi Akar.

Turkey invaded northeast Syria on [9 Oct 2019] to clear a "safe zone" in which to resettle 3.6 million Syrian refugees residing in Turkey, as well as to combat Kurdish groups in the region it considers terrorist organizations. Some of these Kurdish groups were instrumental in the US-led fight against ISIS in Syria.

Syrian president Bashar Assad has repeatedly used chemical weapons against Syrian citizens in the country's civil war.

[This account of use of white phosphorus (WP) is unconfirmed at the moment. Examination of the burn victims will likely confirm WP. WP use has been recorded in number of conflicts. It has been used as far back as World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, and others.

WP can cause injuries and death in 3 ways: by burning deep into tissue, by being inhaled as a smoke, and by being ingested. Extensive exposure by burning and ingestion may result in death.

Injuries from WP: Incandescent particles of a WP weapon's initial explosion can produce extensive, partial and full thickness burns (1,2). One reason why this occurs is the tendency of the element to stick to the skin. Phosphorus burns carry a greater risk of mortality than other forms of burns due to the absorption of phosphorus into the body through the burned area, resulting in liver, heart and kidney damage, and in some cases multiple organ failure (3). These weapons are particularly dangerous to exposed people because WP continues to burn unless deprived of oxygen or until it is completely consumed. In some cases, burns are limited to areas of exposed skin because the smaller WP particles do not burn completely through personal clothing before being consumed.

Smoke inhalation: Burning WP produces a hot, dense, white smoke consisting mostly of phosphorus pentoxide. Exposure to heavy smoke concentrations of any kind for an extended period (particularly if near the source of emission) has the potential to cause illness or death. WP smoke irritates the eyes, mucous membranes of the nose, and respiratory tract in moderate concentrations, while higher concentrations can produce severe burns. The US Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry has set an acute inhalation Minimum Risk Level (MRL) for WP smoke of 0.02 mg/m3, the same as fuel-oil fumes. By contrast, the chemical weapon mustard gas is 30 times more potent: 0.0007 mg/m3 (4). The agency states that the 1935 study used to determine the MRL was insufficient to accurately assess the health risk to humans (5). No studies have investigated the lethal effects of inhalation of WP by humans (6); a former US soldier has stated that breathing in smoke close to a shell caused the throat and lungs to blister until the victim suffocated, with the phosphorus continuing to burn them from the inside (7).

Oral ingestion: The accepted lethal dose when WP is ingested orally is 1 mg/kg body weight, although the ingestion of as little as 15 mg has resulted in death (8). It may also cause liver, heart or kidney damage (3). There are reports of individuals with a history of oral ingestion who have passed phosphorus-laden stool ("smoking stool syndrome") (8). Its extreme toxicity is due to the generation of free radicals, especially in the liver, where they accumulate and are not easily metabolized.

Fume inhalation: Long-term inhalation of derivative fumes causes a condition called phossy jaw or osteonecrosis of the jaw, which is a painful, debilitating and ultimately lethal condition that afflicted factory workers involved with the manufacture of matches that contained WP. The mechanism for necrosis is clot formation leading to bone ischaemia or infarction, leading to the putrid rotting of the bone of the lower jaw. For this reason, the Berne Convention (1906) was enacted to forbid the manufacture, sale or purchase of matches containing WP. This condition may also be caused by high doses of lead, cadmium and bisphosphonate-based cancer drugs.
