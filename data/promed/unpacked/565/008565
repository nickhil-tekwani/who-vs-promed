Two heifers have died from anthrax in Chandmani-undur and Ulaan-uul soums
[districts] of [Khovsgol] province, respectively. This area is already
registered as the anthrax infected zone. These 2 heifers were not
vaccinated with the anthrax vaccine and heifers were diagnosed with anthrax
based on bacteriologic test, microscopic examination, anthrax rapid testing
kit, and Ascoli test in the Aimag [province] veterinary laboratory. The
area is always covered with snow in the winter season but this year
[2008-09] the area is without snow and with dust storms. Local animals are
grazing outside all year around. Recently anthrax spread has been occurring
during the winter season making it a problematic issue.

We thank so much that you are making attention for anthrax related issues
in Mongolia.

[Dr Tserendorj has kindly resolved the conundrum of the January 2009 report
of anthrax in Khovsgol that with their present lack of snow cover they are
seeing grazing cases of anthrax in their livestock. Not something one would
normally expect from climate change. This also means that they will be
coming into spring with a severe drought already in place. It is going to
be a hard year for them.

We normally expect to see anthrax outbreaks in livestock in hot dry
summers. Cold will also negatively impact the innate resistance and thereby
lower the infective dose of spores needed to initiate a possible lethal
infection. - Mod.MHJ
