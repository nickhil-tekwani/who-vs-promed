An outbreak of a leishmaniasis caused [transmitted] by sand fly bites that
leaves disfiguring skin sores has hit Afghanistan, with tens of thousands
of people infected, health officials said on Friday [15 Oct 2010].

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease transmitted by the female
phlebotomine sand fly. Treatable with medication and not life-threatening,
cutaneous leishmaniasis can leave severe scars on the bodies of victims.

The disease threatens 13 million people in Afghanistan, the World Health
Organization (WHO) said, and many impoverished Afghan victims can't afford
the medication to treat it.

In Kabul -- described by WHO as "the world capital of cutaneous
leishmaniasis" -- the number of cases jumped from an estimated 17 000 a
year in the early 2000s to 65 000 in 2009, WHO said.

Most victims are women and children. WHO said women and children are more
vulnerable because they mostly live indoors at night, where the sand flies
prefer to bite, and are therefore more susceptible than men who are
generally outside the home.

Peter Graaff, WHO representative to Afghanistan, told The Associated Press
on Friday that the stigma and shame attached to the disfiguring disease
results in underreporting, and the number of infected people is likely much
higher. "This number is likely to be the tip of the iceberg as cases are
grossly underreported," said Graaff. An outbreak has occurred in a small
village in western Herat province's Kohsan district with 63 people infected
since August [2010], Graaff said. The cause of the outbreak was unknown and
a WHO team has been dispatched to investigate, he said.

The sand flies proliferate from June to September. They thrive in
unsanitary conditions such as piles of garbage and debris, though bed nets
offer protection from their bites. As the disfiguring sores grow larger,
many suffer social stigmatization.

"The high cost of treatment makes it difficult to integrate
anti-Leishmaniasis drugs," said Dr Suraya Dalil, acting minister of public
health. "I urge donors to take this cause seriously, as it causes
unnecessary suffering amongst a large number of Afghans."

According to WHO as many as 12 million people are infected worldwide with
the with about 1 million to 2 million new cases annually.

increase in cases in Kabul coincide with the increasing number of
inhabitants in Kabul and leishmaniasis has been endemic in Afghanistan for
decades. - Mod.EP
