The SARS-CoV-2 virus was likely circulating in northern Italy as early as November 2019, 3 months before the 1st case was formally identified in what would become the European region hardest hit by the 1st wave of the pandemic.

In a new report scheduled for publication next year [2021], a team of researchers from the University of Milan and Memorial University of Newfoundland said a swab taken from a 4-year-old boy who lived near Milan showed a 100% match for an early strain of the virus that broke out in Wuhan, China.

The boy showed his 1st symptoms, a cough and a runny nose, on 21 Nov 2019, the scientists report in the February 2021 edition of Emerging Infectious Diseases, a publication of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A week later, the boy was taken to the emergency room with respiratory problems and vomiting. The next day, he began experiencing a rash, which doctors said resembled symptoms of measles. The swab showed no signs of measles -- but later testing showed he had contracted the novel coronavirus.

The child had not traveled, suggesting the virus may already have been spreading around northern Italy.

The new research adds to evidence that the virus began spreading in Italy months before it was first identified in China. Previous research has identified remnants of the virus in untreated wastewater in the area around Milan beginning in mid-December [2019].

The 1st positive case of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Italy was identified in the town of Codogno, southeast of Milan, on 21 Feb 2020. Italy's Lombardy region became the epicenter of the 1st wave of Europe's outbreak in February and March [2020], when health systems were so overwhelmed that some hospitals had to ration care. "Long-term, unrecognized spread of SARS-CoV-2 in northern Italy would help explain, at least in part, the devastating impact and rapid course of the 1st wave of COVID-19 in Lombardy," the researchers wrote.

Earlier studies of varying strains collected in the 1st months of the outbreak suggest the virus was introduced to Italy repeatedly, from both China and Germany.

Emerg Infect Dis. 2021 Feb [11 Dec 2020]. https://doi.org/10.3201/eid2702.204632 (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/27/2/20-4632_article).

"Abstract
"We identified severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA in an oropharyngeal swab specimen collected from a child with suspected measles in early December 2019, approximately 3 months before the 1st identified coronavirus disease case in Italy. This finding expands our knowledge on timing and mapping of novel coronavirus transmission pathways.

"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) symptoms can encompass a Kawasaki disease-like multisystem inflammatory syndrome and skin manifestations that accompany common viral infections such as chickenpox and measles (1,2 [see source URL for complete references]). Some of the earliest reports of COVID-19 cutaneous manifestations came from dermatologists in Italy. In fact, Italy was the 1st Western country severely hit by the COVID-19 epidemic. The 1st known COVID-19 case in Italy was reported in the town of Codogno in the Lombardy region on 21 Feb 2020. However, some evidence suggests that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had been circulating unnoticed for several weeks in Lombardy before the 1st official detection (3). Phylogenetic studies highlighted an early circulation of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy and suggest multiple introductions of the virus from China and Germany, followed by an autochthonous transmission (4,5). Furthermore, environmental surveillance has unequivocally demonstrated the presence of the virus, at concentrations comparable to those obtained from samples collected at later stages of the pandemic, in the untreated wastewater of the Milan area as early as mid-December 2019 (6).

"As participants in Italy's Measles and Rubella Network, a sensitive case-based surveillance system, we observed in Milan during late autumn 2019 cases of suspected measles in patients who eventually tested negative for measles. We therefore retrospectively explored a possible etiologic involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in these non-measles-linked rash cases.

"We analyzed oropharyngeal swabs specimens collected during September 2019-February 2020 from 39 consenting patients (mean age 19.9 years [range 8 months-73 years]). All laboratory procedures were conducted in a university research laboratory, accredited according to World Health Organization standards, dedicated exclusively to the surveillance of measles and rubella, and therefore designated as free from SARS-CoV-2. RNA strands stored at -80 deg C (-112 deg F) were tested by an in-house heminested reverse transcription PCR assay for the amplification of a 470-bp fragment of the gene encoding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Primers used during the 1st amplification step were Out_f 5'-AGGCTGCGTTATAGCTTGGA-3' and MaSi_Ar 5'-ACACTGACACCACCAAAAGAAC-3'. Primers used for the 2nd step were SiMa_Bf 5'-TCTTGATTCTAAGGTTGGTGGT-3' and MaSi Ar 5'-ACACTGACACCACCAAAAGAAC-3'. Positive and negative controls also were included in each PCR test and performed as expected.

"One oropharyngeal swab specimen tested positive. The amplicon was sequenced by using Sanger technology, resulting in a sequence of 409 bp. Sequence analysis performed by using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) showed 100% identity to the reference sequence Wuhan-HU-1 (GenBank accession no. NC_045512.2) as well as to sequences of other SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating worldwide at a later stage; therefore, accurately determining the origin of the identified strain was not possible. The specimen was confirmed as positive by repeated amplification and sequencing, and all other specimens were repeatedly negative. The sequence (SARS-CoV-2_Milan_Dec2019 [GenBank accession no. MW303957]) was identified in a specimen collected from a 4-year-old boy who lived in the surrounding area of Milan and had no reported travel history. On 21 Nov 2019, the child had cough and rhinitis; about a week later (30 Nov 2019), he was taken to the emergency department with respiratory symptoms and vomiting. On 1 Dec 2019 he had onset of a measles-like rash; on 5 Dec 2019 (14 days after symptom onset), the oropharyngeal swab specimen was obtained for clinical diagnosis of suspected measles. This patient's clinical course, which included late skin manifestations, resembles what has been reported by other authors; maculopapular lesions have been among the most prevalent cutaneous manifestations observed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and several studies have noticed a later onset in younger patients (7).

"We describe the earliest evidence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in a patient in Italy, approximately 3 months before Italy's 1st reported COVID-19 case. These findings, in agreement with other evidence of early COVID-19 spread in Europe, advance the beginning of the outbreak to late autumn 2019 (6,8-10). However, earlier strains also might have been occasionally imported to Italy and other countries in Europe during this period, manifesting with sporadic cases or small self-limiting clusters. These importations could have been different from the strain that became widespread in Italy during the 1st months of 2020. Unfortunately, the swab specimen, which was collected for measles diagnosis, was not optimal for SARS-CoV-2 detection because it was an oropharyngeal rather than a nasopharyngeal swab specimen and it was collected 14 days after the onset of symptoms, when viral shedding is reduced. In addition, thawing might have partially degraded the RNA, preventing the sequencing of longer genomic regions that could have been helpful in determining the origin of the strain.

"This finding is of epidemiologic importance because it expands our knowledge on timing and mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission pathways. Long-term, unrecognized spread of SARS-CoV-2 in northern Italy would help explain, at least in part, the devastating impact and rapid course of the 1st wave of COVID-19 in Lombardy. Full exploitation of existing virologic surveillance systems to promptly identify emerging pathogens is therefore a priority to more precisely clarify the course of outbreaks in a population. Further studies aimed at detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in archived samples suitable for whole-genome sequencing will be crucial at determining exactly the timeline of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and will be helpful for the preparedness against future epidemics."

There is now mounting evidence that the virus was most like circulating outside of China before it was officially recognized. The 1st identification was a case in France in December 2019 (see COVID-19 update (160): global, France Dec 2019 case, tocilizumab, WHO, RFI 20200506.7304287 and ref. 1 below). The USA recently published on possible evidence of circulation of the virus in the USA before 20 Jan 2020, the 1st confirmed case. Basavaraju et al. (ref. 2 below) used blood bank sera and tested serology: "Of the 7389 samples, 106 were reactive by pan Ig. Of these 106 specimens, 90 were available for further testing. Eighty-four of 90 had neutralizing activity, 1 had S1 binding activity, and 1 had receptor binding domain / Ace2 blocking activity greater than 50%, suggesting the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies. Donations with reactivity occurred in all 9 states." Other studies on wastewater have also suggested the presence of the virus. (COVID-19 update (272): Italy sewage, Germany slaughterhouse, WHO, global 20200620.7490347 and refs. 3 and 4 below). We are clearly still on the upward slope of the learning curve with respect to the SARS-CoV-2.

SARS-CoV-2 duplicate infection (7-month interval)
-------------------------------------------------
Patient is a 39-year-old white male, A-negative blood type, seen in July 2020 for anxiety, states otherwise healthy, had complained of a "SARS-like" illness in February 2020, with symptoms of mild fever, body aches and impaired smell. Patient recovered after 2 weeks of just self-supportive care. [When seen in July 2020] was noted to have a normal Chem 21 panel, CBC, and a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG on serum lab [serum sent to 2 different commercial labs: 1 was positive for SAR-CoV-2 IgG, the other was negative -- verbal report speaking to Dr. Hall].

During a trip to Mexico to attend "Art With Me," an art and music festival that ran 11-15 Nov 2020 in Tulum, Mexico, new health events presented. At that time, he complained of feeling unwell and having issues with slight fever on 17 Nov 2020. On morning of 18 Nov 2020, on presumption of possible flu-like respiratory illness or COVID-19, he was advised to see physician as he had complaints of mild fever-like chills and self-assessed oxygen levels of 94%. He was immediately seen by a hotel doctor, was given "shot" and oral azithromycin, monitored, told that because he had previously tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG that COVID-19 was unlikely, and was not PCR tested in Mexico.

On 19 Nov 2020, oxygen levels of 92% were observed and a temperature of 99.5 deg F [37.5 deg C] noted. Fearful, he traveled back to Miami without PCR screen as per hotel doctor's advice. He was screened in Miami and found to be PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2. We presume he had lost his previous antibody protection between July and November 2020. The event the patient attended in Tulum was described a super-spreader event. Please be advised on the dynamics of the 2nd infection and that his new symptoms were worse than his 1st episode.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Hall for sharing this clinical information with us. With passage of time, there are more and more case reports of possible reinfection events. Unfortunately, the absence of a virus identification in his 1st clinical COVID-19-like event combined with equivocal serology results makes it difficult to actually confirm a 2nd infection event. A 7-month interval between the 2 events is plausible. - Mod.MPP]

[3] USA: FDA grants Pfizer emergency use authorization
Date: Fri 11 Dec 2020
Source: STAT [abridged, edited]
https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/11/fda-grants-historic-authorization-to-a-covid-19-vaccine-setting-stage-for-rollout/


The Food and Drug Administration on Friday [11 Dec 2020] issued an emergency authorization for a COVID-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and its German partner, BioNTech, a seminal moment in the effort to curb a pandemic that has so far infected an estimated 16 million people and killed nearly 300 000 in the USA.

The decision means vaccinations will begin in a matter of days in individuals 16 years of age or older. Initial supplies of the 2-dose vaccine are expected to be used primarily in 2 groups most at risk of getting infected or developing severe disease: healthcare providers and residents and staff of long-term care facilities.

The vaccine is the 1st to be authorized in the USA, and has already been authorized in the UK, Canada, and several other countries. But neither in those countries, nor in the USA, is the vaccine expected to be a panacea for the pandemic.

While the vaccine was shown to reduce the risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 infection by about 95% in Phase 3 clinical trials, a number of factors may constrain its potential to turn the pandemic's tide, at least in the short term. Among other issues: Initial supplies of the vaccine are extremely limited; many Americans are reluctant to take the vaccine at all; and in certain populations, including people who are pregnant and children, the vaccine has not yet been tested.

Importantly, while the vaccine reduces the risk of developing symptomatic infection, it's not yet clear whether it also reduces transmission of the virus that causes the disease, SARS-CoV-2. It's possible that people who are vaccinated can still contract the virus and then transmit it to others, though they themselves would not get sick. As a result, health officials are urging everyone, including the vaccinated, to continue to practice social distancing measures and to wear masks.

The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was developed at breakneck speed, and the Trump administration agreed over the summer to an initial USD 1.95 billion purchase of 100 million doses, before knowing whether it would be safe and effective.

In clinical trials, it proved to be both. The most common side effects included pain at the injection site, fatigue, and fever. Serious adverse reactions were rare. In a 44 000-volunteer study, there were 4 cases of Bell's palsy, a temporary weakness or paralysis, in the vaccine arm and none in the placebo arm. There were also 64 cases of lymphadenopathy, a swelling of the lymph nodes, in the vaccine group versus 6 in the placebo group. Those cases all resolved.

The FDA's decision follows the recommendation of an advisory committee that an emergency use authorization be granted to the vaccine. The same committee is scheduled to meet on 17 Dec 2020 to review data on a vaccine developed by Moderna, a biotechnology company based in Massachusetts. Its vaccine had efficacy levels similar to Pfizer's and is based on the same technology, known as messenger RNA. It is widely expected to be authorized.

[The authorization letter can be found at https://www.fda.gov/media/144412/download. The USA is now joining other countries -- the UK, Bahrain, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and Mexico -- in authorizing the vaccine. One suspects the same sequence will occur next week when the FDA review board and FDA will review the Moderna vaccine. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 218 (Samoa has not been added as yet).

Data by country, area, or territory for 11 Dec 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesDEC11_1607733922.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 47.4% of daily case numbers and 44.2% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours but maintained its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 29.4 million cases. The USA continues to dominate, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Canada, and Argentina. Other countries reporting more than 1000 cases include Panama, Chile, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Ecuador. And countries reporting more than 500 cases but fewer than 1000 in the past 24 hours include Paraguay, Peru, Guatemala, Honduras, and Belize.

- The European region reported 39.4% of daily case numbers and 43.5% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 21.4 million. Countries not reporting cases today (11 Dec 2020) include Kazakhstan among others. Countries reporting more than 10 000 cases in the past 24 hours include Turkey, Germany, Russia, UK, Italy, Poland, France, and Ukraine. There are 24 additional countries reporting more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours and 6 countries reporting more than 500 but fewer than 1000 cases.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.3% of daily case numbers and 4.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.43 million cases. Iran maintains its dominance, with daily totals now beginning to drop from more than 13 000 to fewer than 11 000, followed by Morocco, Pakistan, Jordan, Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, Iraq, and the UAE. Tunisia and Libya each reported more than 500 but fewer than 1000 new cases, while Sudan, Djibouti and Somalia have not reported any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The African region reported 1.8% of daily case numbers and 1.9% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than 1.59 million cases. South Africa maintains its dominance (reporting over 8000 cases), followed by Nigeria, Uganda, Kenya, Algeria, Ethiopia, Namibia, DR Congo, Mali, Angola, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Senegal. Cameroon, Madagascar, Cabo Verde, Mauritania and Botswana among other countries did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.1% of daily case numbers and 0.57% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.94 million cases. Japan is maintaining its dominance followed by Malaysia, Philippines, South Korea, French Polynesia, and China.

- The South East Asia region reported 6.0% of the daily newly reported cases and 5.0% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 11.27 million cases. As previously, India remains dominant, followed by Indonesia (with more than 6000 cases confirmed in the past 24 hours), Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and the Maldives.

Impression: Basically, unchanged on the regional levels, with the continued dominance of Europe and the Americas region representing over 86% of both newly confirmed cases and newly reported deaths in the past 24 hours. Countries in the African region have reported more cases, but I suspect this has to do with not reporting yesterday (10 Dec 2020). At the country level, it is basically unchanged as well. Japan is the dominant country in the Western Pacific region, while South Korea continues to report more than 600 cases daily; Turkey, Germany and Russia are dominant in the European region. Indonesia has been increasing daily reports in the South East Asian region. South Africa maintains dominance in the African region at a higher level in recent days, and Iran maintains its dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean region although transmission may be slowing down. The USA maintains its position as the country reporting the most cases on a daily basis, and Brazil has been increasing daily reports.

[In the past 24 hours, the USA (256 065), Brazil (52 770), Turkey (32 106) and India (30 034) have reported the highest numbers of cases. A global total of 12 841 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (10-11 Dec 2020).

Countries reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours (12 countries) include USA, Brazil, Turkey, India, Russia (28 585), Germany (28 344), UK (21 672), Italy (18 726), Ukraine (13 514), France (13 406), Poland (13 105), and Mexico (12 253). A total of 62 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 34 of the 62 countries reporting more than 1000 newly confirmed cases are from the European region, 10 are from the Americas region, 9 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 5 are from the South East Asia region, 3 are from the Western Pacific region, and 1 from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 22.8%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 2.0%. The USA has increased both newly confirmed cases (15.5%) and reported deaths (18.4%). The 7-day average daily new cases reported in the USA is 217 560 and newly reported deaths is 2457. The USA reported over 3000 deaths in the past 24 hours.

Impression: The global daily reported cases shows today is almost 3 quarters of a million cases. Countries in the European and the Americas regions are still showing the largest increases in daily new case counts, followed by the Eastern Mediterranean and the South East Asia regions. The global total is now over 71 million cases. The USA continues to show uncontrolled transmission, although the rate of increase may be slowing down. - Mod.MPP]
