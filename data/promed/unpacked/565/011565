1st report of Grapevine Pinot gris virus in Italy
-------------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organisation] of Italy recently informed EPPO about the detection GPGV in a commercial vineyard located in the province of Piacenza, region of Emilia-Romagna.

The grower had reported poor vegetation and [severe] production reduction in the affected vineyard. Disease symptoms were observed on 10-20 year-old grapevine plants (_Vitis vinifera_ cvs. 'Pinot noir, 'Pinot gris', 'Chardonnay', and 'Sauvignon') but not on young plants. The disease was observed on approximately 8 ha [about 20 acres] of the vineyard (total vineyard 13 ha [about 32 acres]) with 20 percent of the plants showing symptoms.

In August 2013, the identity of the virus was confirmed by the University of Bologna, using RT-PCR. For the moment, no phytosanitary measures have been taken but a PRA [pest risk analysis] is in progress.

[_Grapevine Pinot gris virus_ (GPGV; genus _Trichovirus_) is a newly classified virus of grapevine, which was identified in Italy on grapevine cv. Pinot Gris with symptoms of chlorotic mottling and leaf deformations. It was detected by new large scale sequencing methods ("deep sequencing") in co-infection with several other viruses and viroids, and therefore it was initially not possible to clearly associate the virus with specific symptoms. GPGV has also been reported from the Republic of Korea and Slovenia, and it is suspected in the Czech Republic.

Amongst the grapevine viruses, GPGV appears to be most closely related to _Grapevine berry inner necrosis virus_ (GINV) of the same genus. Trichoviruses are mostly transmitted by grafting material and mechanical means, and GINV is also transmitted by a mite vector. Work is in progress to investigate symptomatology (alone and in co-infections), possible vectors, epidemiology and impact of GPGV.

Disease management of grapevine viruses and viroids may include phytosanitation, such as removal of infected plants and disinfection of vineyard tools. Use of certified clean planting material (including tissue cultures, rootstocks and scions for grafting) is essential.
