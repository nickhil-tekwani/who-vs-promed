[1] Ebola evades immune system

Monash University, Australia, researchers have discovered a key way that one of the world's deadliest pathogens, Ebola virus, evades the immune system. Understanding this process provides new potential targets for the future development of antiviral therapies for a disease that killed over 11 000 people in an outbreak in West Africa between 2014 and 2016, with mortality rates in past outbreaks of 25% to 90%.

An outbreak of Ebola, for which treatment options are extremely limited, occurred earlier this year [2021] in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In common with viruses such as the Hendra and rabies viruses, Ebola infects humans from animals, with bats thought to be the natural hosts.

The research team, led by Dr. Greg Moseley and Dr. Angela Harrison from the Monash University Biomedicine Discovery Institute, in collaboration with researchers at the Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness (ACDP, CSIRO) found that Ebola virus can block the function of the STAT3 protein, a critical "messenger" protein that transmits signals within our cells important to regulating host immune and inflammatory responses against infections.

Importantly, using infections with pathogenic virus under the highest biocontainment level (BSL4) together with gene expression analysis and quantitative single cell imaging, the research team have discovered that STAT3 activity is antiviral toward Ebola virus, but that Ebola virus uses a protein called VP24 to target and disable STAT3's messenger function through at least 2 different strategies, including binding to STAT3 protein complexes.

The findings were published today [24 Jun 2021] in the journal PLOS Pathogens.

The elucidation of this entirely new way for Ebola virus to disarm immune responses may provide new targets that can be used in research towards developing new antivirals that prevent Ebola virus, and possibly other viruses, from interfering with the infected person's antiviral system, allowing them to fight off the disease, according to Dr. Moseley. "This shows us that Ebola virus uses more tricks to evade and dysregulate the immune system than we previously thought and highlights the expanding importance of targeting of STAT3 by viruses.

"Understanding this process gives us new potential targets that might contribute to developing therapies that block the ability of Ebola and other viruses to shut down the immune response," he said.

Importantly, the STAT3 pathway is also involved in the pathogenesis of many other diseases, including cancers. Dr. Moseley believes that understanding how Ebola virus and other viruses specifically target and modify STAT3 could also provide new directions for the development of therapeutics for diseases such as cancer.

Abstract: "Many viruses target signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 and 2 to antagonise antiviral interferon signalling, but targeting of signalling by other STATs/cytokines, including STAT3/interleukin 6 that regulate processes important to Ebola virus (EBOV) haemorrhagic fever, is poorly defined. We report that EBOV potently inhibits STAT3 responses to interleukin-6 family cytokines, and that this is mediated by the interferon-antagonist VP24. Mechanistic analysis indicates that VP24 effects a unique strategy combining distinct karyopherin-dependent and karyopherin-independent mechanisms to antagonise STAT3-STAT1 heterodimers and STAT3 homodimers, respectively. This appears to reflect distinct mechanisms of nuclear trafficking of the STAT3 complexes, revealed for the first time by our analysis of VP24 function. These findings are consistent with major roles for global inhibition of STAT3 signalling in EBOV infection and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of STAT3 nuclear trafficking, significant to pathogen-host interactions, cell physiology and pathologies such as cancer."

And from later in the same report, the "data suggest that virus-STAT3 interactions could provide new directions for the development of antivirals for diverse pathogens. Beyond the implications for viral infection, the study also provides, to our knowledge, the 1st clear indication of distinct nuclear import strategies for STAT3 homodimers and heterodimers, potentially accounting for the contrasting trafficking models previously proposed (24-28). Together with our recent finding that lyssaviruses differentially target STAT3 dimers to modulate cytokine-induced transcription (20), this supports the idea that these complexes have distinct roles in signalling by STAT3, a pleiotropic molecule important to processes including cancer, development and immunity." - Mod.LK]

[2] Ebola response

The World Health Organization and the government of Guinea declared the end of the Ebola outbreak in Guinea on Saturday [19 Jun 2021] -- marking the first time the African continent has been considered Ebola-free since February [2021].

This outbreak in Guinea was contained in 4 months, with 16 confirmed and 7 probable cases, as well as 12 deaths. It occurred in what was ground zero for the massive outbreak in West Africa between 2014 and 2016 -- the largest in the world -- which spiraled out of control, spanned 3 countries, and cost over 11 000 lives.

"We are getting faster, better, and smarter at fighting Ebola," said WHO Africa Regional Director Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, through a translator, during a press conference last Thursday [17 Jun 2021].

The 1st cases were reported in Guinea in February [2021] only a week after a case of Ebola was identified in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which also previously suffered from a lengthy, complicated Ebola outbreak response that ended last year [2020] in July. News of these 2 outbreaks raised concerns about how these countries will manage both Ebola responses and efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Guinea also had a Lassa fever outbreak, while working to contain this outbreak.

The recent response in eastern DRC was contained in 3 months, with 11 confirmed cases, as opposed to nearly 2 years and 3481 cases like the previous outbreak in the region. Another outbreak in the Equateur province of the country, which was contained in 6 months, ended last November [2020].

The ability to protect health workers played a key role in the effectiveness of this response, according to Guinean Health Minister of Guinea Dr. Remy Lamah. Deaths [of] health workers in the previous outbreak in West Africa led to a reduction of the health workforce by 6.9% in Sierra Leone, 8.1% in Liberia, and 1.5% in Guinea. But recently, health responders were able to quickly deploy vaccines to over 2800 front-line workers to prevent them from contracting the disease, as well as others who were at high risk of contracting it, including contacts of positive cases. During the previous West Africa outbreak, vaccines were still in development. Two treatments for the disease that weren't available in the last West Africa outbreak were also used.

Health responders who were involved in the previous response were quickly deployed to respond again, Lamah said, adding that this led to quick management of patients and efforts to stop transmission. Health workers from Guinea were deployed in DRC as well, given their expertise in managing Ebola. Since the previous outbreak, Guinea also set up a national agency for health epidemics, and integrated its laboratories, which aided the response, he added.

Moeti said the response was also able to effectively step up surveillance and screenings at border crossings, preventing the outbreak from spilling into neighboring countries.

A spokesperson for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) said that mobile radios were one of the effective methods in which IFRC communicated with people in remote and rural areas to provide information on how to protect themselves against Ebola, as only about 15% to 20% of the county where the outbreak occurred has access to the internet.

WHO declares an Ebola epidemic over after 42 days have passed since the last confirmed case tests negative for the disease twice. This period is 2 times the maximum incubation period of the virus.

But this victory is fragile. One of the disturbing findings of this outbreak was that it was linked to the previous outbreak through the bodily fluids of survivors and was transmitted from one human to another rather than from an animal. While health researchers knew that the virus could persist in survivors -- it was a shock that it could persist for that long. This changes how health responders need to monitor for future outbreaks, Moeti said.

"We must continue to support survivors, monitor their health, and check for the disease's presence without creating unfair stigma," she said.

Following the declaration that Guinea is Ebola-free, teams are now finalizing a 90-day resilience plan to support local health workers and communities to monitor and respond to future cases, Moeti said.

And while these responses have improved significantly, there is always room in Ebola responses for better community engagement, said Moeti, adding that the response in Guinea faced initial resistance from communities, including people not willing to come to the health facilities if they are sick and community members hiding positive cases.

A continual process of engagement is needed, even before outbreaks occur, so when health responders need to make unusual requests from communities that disrupt their lives, like asking them not to congregate together, the lines of communication are already there so that people respond quickly, she said.

There is also a need to strengthen community surveillance in the Nzerekore Province, where the outbreak occurred, as well as neighboring provinces to improve systems of reporting and response, according to WHO.

[It is impressive how effective the Ebola vaccine was in these last outbreaks, stopping virus spread quickly. But clearly other lessons have been learned that will make a difference in the future, such as knowledge that virus can persist in testes for prolonged periods, recognition of the need for effective community surveillance, as well as keeping open ongoing lines of communication. - Mod.LK]
