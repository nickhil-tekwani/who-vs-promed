Poland closes in on source of first BSE case
--------------------------------------------
After a massive 2-day search, Polish officials on Sun 5 May 2002
located the place where the country's first case of mad cow disease may
have originated, but are still unsure how the animal got infected.
Before this weekend's revelation that a cow slaughtered near the Slovak
border was contaminated, Poland had been considered a "low-risk" country
for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), believed to cause the deadly
human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease. Inadequate documentation about the
9-year-old cow's history forced police and veterinary services to conduct a
village-by-village search before tracing its origin to the tiny farming
community of Swiebodzin.
"We still have to establish the animal's genealogy and what it was fed,"
the chief veterinarian of southern Malopolska province Krzysztof Ankiewicz
told a news conference in the region's capital, Krakow. No other diseased
animal had been found so far but 3 other cows in the same abattoir had also
been destroyed as a precaution, officials said. It was not clear whether
any livestock in Swiebodzin would be isolated or slaughtered.
The labor-intensive search illustrated the problems caused by Poland's
antiquated agricultural infrastructure less [than] 2 years before the
country is expected to join the European Union. "The present livestock
tagging system does not meet European Union requirements," Piotr Kolodziej,
Poland's chief veterinarian, told reporters. "In the EU an animal can be
identified in a matter of minutes." Poland has delayed implementing EU
livestock identification norms due to logistical problems and poor
planning. "The introduction of a proper identification system and creation
of a database should get under way this year and be completed by the end of
2003," Kolodziej said.
More than 100 people, most in Britain, have died or are believed to be
suffering from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, which is thought to be caused by
eating contaminated meat products. [According to the official UK figures,
their number was 121 on 6 May 2002.- Mod.AS] But no fatalities have been
reported in Poland, eastern Europe's biggest farm economy. Poland, an
exporter of beef, checks every cow older than 30 months old for BSE when it
is slaughtered, but animals are not always closely monitored from the
moment of their birth as is the case in the EU. The European Commission
wrote in a report in February that it was concerned about the ability of
Poland to detect BSE and contain the disease from spreading if an outbreak
occurred.

Poland's neighbors ban beef imports after BSE detection
---------------------------------------------------------
Veterinary authorities of Ukraine and Estonia have banned beef
imports from Poland after the first BSE case was detected in Poland Sat 4
May 2002, according to Ukraynsky Novyny agency and the Polish embassy in
Tallinn.
Ukraine banned imports of beef from Poland for 5 years. The ban on Polish
beef has also been imposed by Lithuania and Russia. Russia additionally
banned, until further notice, imports of lamb and meat of ruminants.
Also Romania joined the group of countries that put the ban on imports of
Polish beef, according to the Romanian Agriculture Ministry.
On Monday, Tarnow [southern Poland] prosecutor's office accused 2 men
apprehended in connection with BSE detection of falsifying documentation on
the sick cow.

[The identification of BSE in Poland should not be overly surprising. The
EU Scientific Steering Committee adopted on 30 Mar 2001 its opinion on the
"Geographical Risk of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (GBR)" in Poland,
stating that "it is likely but not confirmed that one or several cattle
that are (pre-clinically or clinically) infected with the BSE agent are
currently present in the domestic herd of Poland (GBR III)". The main
reason for that assessment was the fact that Poland was exposed to an
"extremely high" external challenge since 1991, mainly due to massive
imports of meat and bone meal (MBM) from BSE-affected countries. This
import was in the range of 1 700 000 tonnes in total, of which around 1 000
000 tonnes was from Germany, and the rest mainly from Denmark and the
Netherlands. In addition, the GBR report indicated that feeding MBM to
cattle was legally possible until March 1997 and likely to have occurred.
Rendering was a common practice in Poland, the raw materials for which
include specific risk materials (SRM) and condemned organs from slaughtered
ruminants and a limited amount of fallen stock. Active surveillance for BSE
started in 2001. The report concluded: "Given the very unstable system and
the fact that the BSE-agent is likely to be already present in the
country, it is assumed that the GBR is increasing".
About 100 000 BSE tests have been carried out, so far, in Polish cattle (see
ref. below). The total cattle population of Poland (OIE yearbook, 2000) is
approx. 6 million head. The testing rate (in healthy adult animals) in most
EU countries was significantly higher during 2001 (total national cattle
population in millions, from same source: France - 2 382 225 (20.0);
Germany - 2 565 341 (14.5); Ireland - 636 930 (7.2); the Netherlands - 454
649 (4.0).
Additional information on the results of the epidemiological investigations
in Poland, with special reference to the source of infection, will be very
helpful. - Mod.AS]
