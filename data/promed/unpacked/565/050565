Newcastle disease in Brazil: (Date of previous outbreak of Newcastle
disease in Brazil reported to the OIE: April 2001).
[According to ABC, Paraguay, 9 Jun 2005, there was an outbreak in
Brazil at that time -- see archive below] - Mod.JW]
Translation of information received on 5 Jul 2006 from Dr Jamil Gomes
de Souza, Director, Department of Animal Protection (DDA), Ministry
of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply, Brasilia:
Report date: 5 Jul 2006.
Reason for immediate notification: re-occurrence of a listed disease
in a country following a report declaring the outbreak(s) ended.
Identification of agent: avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1).
Date of start of the event: 2 May 2006.
Details of outbreak: The outbreak occurred on a farm in Rio Grande
do Sul at Vale de Real (29:19:40 south by 51:14:50.6 west) on 2 May
2006. There were 44 susceptible birds with 17 cases including 16
deaths; 23 birds were destroyed [unfortunately, this does not appear
to account for all 44 susceptible birds - Mod.PC]
Description of affected population: backyard chickens (for grower's
own consumption).
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed: National
Agricultural Laboratory (LANAGRO-PE), Sao Paulo
Results: intracerebral pathogenicity index test on 4 Jul 2006 was positive
Other details/comments: The owner reported the event to the official
veterinary authority on 4 May 2006, the date on which the farm was
inspected and put under a ban. Two zones were established: a
protection zone (3-km-radius zone around the outbreak) and a
surveillance zone (7-km-distance around the protection zone).
Stamping out of all the birds in the farm as well as cleaning and
disinfection are in progress.
Nearby farms are under surveillance and, as of today, no clinical
signs of the Newcastle disease have been detected.

[Brazil's last previous outbreak was in 2001, Argentina's was in
1999, Chile in 1975, Uruguay in 1984, and Paraguay in
1997. Venezuela had an outbreak in 2006.
Newcastle disease, of course, has a very serious economic impact on a
nation's poultry industry through high mortality, quarantine,
depopulation and health-related trade restrictions.
USDA-APHIS summarizes the disease as follows in a fact sheet
at <http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/pubs/fsheet_faq_notice/fs_ahend.html>:
Exotic Newcastle disease (END) is a contagious and fatal viral
disease affecting all species of birds. Previously known as velogenic
viscerotropic Newcastle disease (VVND), END is probably one of the
most infectious diseases of poultry in the world. END is so virulent
that many birds die without showing any clinical signs. A death rate
of almost 100 percent can occur in unvaccinated poultry flocks.
Exotic Newcastle can infect and cause death even in vaccinated
poultry. Clinical signs include: END affects the respiratory,
nervous, and digestive systems. The incubation period for the disease
ranges from 2 to 15 days.
