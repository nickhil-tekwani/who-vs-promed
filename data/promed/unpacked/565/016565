[Rajasthan] state is vulnerable to Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), commonly known as Congo fever, as blood samples drawn from animals in the state tested positive for CCHF virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. Neighbouring state Gujarat has reported CCHF cases sporadically, indicating [to] the health authorities of the state to remain alert on the disease. Now, NIV [National Institute of Virology] officials, including NIV director DT Mourya, have reached the city to sensitise doctors on management of CCHF cases and prevention of nosocomial spread along with other related issues. The NIV informed the state that seropositivity of CCHF among livestock has been reported from the state.

The NIV had conducted the serosurvey to analyse the risk of spread of the disease in the state. However, the last case of CCHF was reported 2 years ago in Jodhpur. "Sheep, goats, and also bovines in the state tested positive for CCHF antibodies." [See comment that follows for more information on serosurvey results. - Mod.JH]

Cases of CCHF have not been reported much in the state. But, NIV had conducted a serosurvey of animals in which they found antibodies of CCHF, which is why the NIV officials have reached Jaipur to conduct a workshop of doctors covering different aspects of CCHF.

[Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral disease that causes a fatal hemorrhagic illness in humans. The disease is asymptomatic in animals.

CCHF was first confirmed in a nosocomial outbreak in 2011 and in July 2013 in Gujarat state. Anti-CCHF virus (CCHFV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in domestic animals from the adjoining villages of the affected area, indicating a considerable amount of positivity against domestic animals. The IgG antibodies ELISA based serosurvey was carried out to determine the prevalence of CCHFV among bovine, sheep, and goat populations from 15 districts of Gujarat state, India. A total of 1226 serum samples from domestic animals were screened. Antibodies were detected in all the 15 districts surveyed; with positivity of 12.09, 41.21, and 33.62 percent in bovine, sheep, and goats respectively (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25229708).

A cross-sectional serosurvey of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was conducted by Mourya et al on livestock in 22 states and 1 union territory of India in 2013-14 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4593432/). A total of 5636 samples from bovines, sheep, and goats were screened for CCHF virus IgG. IgG was detected in 354 samples, indicating that this virus is widespread in this country.

This highlights the importance of surveillance for CCHFV IgG antibodies in animals and hemorrhagic fever cases in humans.

The report above shows that the evidence of CCHF seroconversion indicates vector or cattle movement between the 2 contiguous states, meriting a coordinated surveillance by health, veterinary, and vector monitoring/control personnel.

There is also need to make available safe diagnostic tests that can be used at primary health centers, medical colleges, and all other health settings for early and safe detection of high consequence/dangerous pathogens. - Mod.UBA
