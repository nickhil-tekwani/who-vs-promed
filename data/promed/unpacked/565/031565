======================================

The Houston Health & Human Services Department and Texas Department
of Health have investigated two common-source outbreaks caused by
Cyclospora.
Houston, Texas, May 9 and May 10, 1996
--------------------------------------
The first outbreak involved 28 persons who attended business meetings
at a private club in Houston, Texas on May 9 and May 10, 1996.

Interviews with 26 persons have been completed. Sixteen persons were
ill. All sixteen ill persons experienced diarrhea of 3 days
duration or more and had 3 or more bouts of diarrhea on the worst day
(case definition). Dates of onset of illness ranged from May 14
through May 19 with eight persons having onset on May 16. Five
persons had stools positive for Cyclospora. Analysis of food history
data showed an association with consumption of fresh strawberries and
illness.
Houston, Texas, May 22, 1996
--------------------------------------
The second outbreak involved patrons of a retail restaurant in
Houston, Texas. Interviews with 19 persons who ate at the restaurant
have been completed. All 19 ate at the restaurant on May 22, 1996.

Fourteen of the 19 individuals were members of a single business
party. Ten of the 19 persons were ill, meeting the case definition
used in the first outbreak. Dates on onset of illness ranged from
May 17 through June 1, with four persons having onset on May 30. Two
persons had stools positive for Cyclospora. Analysis of food history
data showed an association with consumption of fresh strawberries and
illness.
Strawberries served at the club came from a single produce wholesaler
(Wholesaler A) in Houston. Strawberries seved at the restaurant came
from two different produce wholesalers (Wholesalers B and C) in
Houston. The source for the fresh strawberries distributed by the
Houston wholesalers were five different growers/distributors in
California.
