In what seems to be a case of negligence on the part of parents, a
4-year-old girl from Saki Naka [suburb] succumbed to rabies a month
after she was bitten by a dog. She was only recently admitted to Nair
Hospital, where she died on Friday [15 Oct 2010], the police said.

However, the parents, who claimed that they were not able to afford
the rabies vaccine, have been given a clean chit by the police. This,
despite the BMC [Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation] officials
claiming that the vaccine is available free of cost at all civic
hospitals in the city. The father of the victim said that the child
had been bitten by a stray [dog] in September 2010 when she was
playing outside their residence at Yadav Nagar on Khairani Road. "We
gave her first aid then. We also gave her medicines. The child
started behaving abnormally on Thursday [14 Oct 2010]. She would bark
and scratch the walls," he told the police.

According to the police, the father works with a private firm and
hails from a lower-middle class family. "The girl's parents could not
afford the cost of the rabies vaccine, so they treated her at home,"
said a police officer. The Saki Naka police learnt about the girl's
death from the hospital authorities. After investigating the matter,
the police issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) to the family to
perform the girl's last rites. "The NOC has to be submitted to the
crematorium office before one can carry out the last rites," senior
inspector S R Dhanedhar said. A police officer said that the girl's
parents completed the formalities and even submitted the doctor's
certificate before the NOC was issued. "We found that the family
claims were genuine, and there was no foul play in the matter," said
the officer.

According to Dr Sameer Dalwai of the Indian Academy of Paediatrics,
"Though we rarely see rabies patients in the city, such incidents
show that there is still a need to create awareness about this
disease." Public sector hospitals offer anti-rabies injection for
free. It costs Rs 250 [about USD 5.70] per shot at private hospitals.
Dr G Ambe, executive health officer of the BMC, said, "All our
hospitals give the vaccine free of cost. It is also available at some
of our dispensaries." He added that on an average, there are only
around 19 cases of rabies per year. "About 1/3rd of these cases of
rabies are from Mumbai, while the rest come to the city from
elsewhere for specialized treatment available at Nair and KEM
Hospitals," he added.

[A tragic tale of the unnecessary death of a child in the conurbation
of Mumbai, following a dog-bite, due directly to apparent parental
and official (the police) ignorance, despite the availability of free
anti-rabies vaccine in all city hospitals. ProMED-mail hopes that
this Times of India story will help to avoid such incidents in the
future.
