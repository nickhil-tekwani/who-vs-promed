Health Warning: Coles And Woolworths Lettuce Linked To Salmonella Outbreak
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Several brands of pre-packed lettuce mixes sold at Coles and Woolworths have been recalled following a major salmonellosis outbreak in Victoria. Affected products include Coles 4 Leaf Mix, Woolworths salad mix, SupaSalad Supamix and Wash N Toss salad mix; all of which are sold in multiple states and territories.

The Victorian Department of Health has issued a food recall for prepackaged salad mixes found in Coles and Woolworths grocery stores. The affected mixes all come from Victorian company Tripod Farmers. Consumers are warned not to eat batches with a best before date of 14 Feb 2016 or earlier. Some of the products are also sold in other states and territories. In addition to Victoria, recalls have been issued in NSW, South Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT.

Brands/products on the recall list:
- SupaSalad (SupaSalad 180g, Green Coral 180g, Supamix 1kg, Spinach 1kg, Rocket 1kg, Baby Cos 1kg, Spinach 180g)
- Wash N Toss (Watercress 100g, Sorrell 50g, Baby Cos 100g, Spinach 100g, Salad Mix 100g, Rocket 100g, Kale 100g)

The lettuce recall follows 28 cases of salmonellosis in the past month. If you have purchased any of the aforementioned products, you are advised to either return them for a refund or dispose of them safely.
