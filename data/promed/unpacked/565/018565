A total of 58 cases of dengue fever-like chikungunya virus [infections] has been recorded nationwide as of yesterday [9 Oct 2012].

Health assistant secretary Eric Tayag said 500 suspected cases of chikungunya were reported as of 8 Oct [2012], compared with 150 in September. "Out of the 500 cases reported to the Department of Health (DOH), 58 were confirmed chikungunya [virus infections] by the DOH's Research Institute for Tropical Medicine," he said.

Speaking at the weekly Kapihan sa Diamond Hotel media forum, Tayag said the chikungunya cases were recorded in Metro Manila, Calabarzon, Western Visayas, and Northern Mindanao. "There are more chikungunya cases recorded now," he said. More doctors are now aware of the symptoms of the illness, Tayag said.

Last year, more than 1000 cases of chikungunya [virus infection] were recorded in the country. Chikungunya, a viral disease spread by mosquitoes, causes fever and severe joint pain, according to the World Health Organization. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and rash.

However, Tayag said chikungunya [virus infection] is not as deadly as dengue [virus infections]. "Chikungunya should not be mistaken for dengue as it shares some clinical symptoms with the latter," he said. Tayag said dengue affects mostly children, while chikungunya [virus] affects adults. Both, however, manifest rashes and fever, he added.

Tayag said arthritis also occurs in chikungunya [virus infections], and some people suffer long-term arthritis for years after they have recovered from the initial infection.

"There is no vaccine available in the country to cure [prevent?] chikungunya virus [infections]," he said.

Health experts have recorded cases of chikungunya [virus infections] in the Philippines since the 1990s.

[Chikungunya virus is doubtless endemic in the Philippines, having caused sporadic outbreaks in 1954, 1956, 1968, and 1985 to 1986 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120929.1315954), mainly in the center and south areas of the country. Since there is no commercially available vaccine, the only preventive measures are mosquito vector control and avoidance of mosquito bites.
