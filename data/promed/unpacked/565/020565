A family, [a 43 year old man and his children 14, 9, and 5.5 years
old], from Jorong Koto Panjang Nagari Kapau, Kecamatan Tilatang
Kamang, Agam, suspected of contracting bird flu [avian influenza] H5N1
after the family's chickens had suddenly died since Friday last week
[10 Jun 2011]. The family started to feel sick and to have high fever
since Monday [13 Jun 2011]. A sample of dead chickens tested positive
for bird flu infection.

The family has been referred to Adam Malik hospital in Bukittinggi
for medical examination.

[It seems unusual that 4 members of a single family fell ill
simultaneously with an A/H5N1 infection, unless all of them were in
direct contact with their sick and dead chickens. Although the report
indicated that the chickens were bird flu positive, it will be
interesting to learn if all 4 family members were positive for A/H5N1
influenza virus infections as well.
