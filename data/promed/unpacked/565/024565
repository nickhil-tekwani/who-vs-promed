Kazakh anthrax linked to horse meat
--------------------------------------------------
Health workers in a southern Kazakh village are trying to prevent the
spread of an anthrax outbreak attributed to diseased horse meat, an
official in the Central Asian country said. "6 men have been hospitalised,
of whom 3 have so far had the diagnosis confirmed," Albert Askarov, head of
epidemiological control at the former Soviet Republic's health ministry,
told [Agence France Presse] AFP.
The 6 residents of Abai village slaughtered the sick animal in early July
2003 without veterinary approval, Askarov said. The slaughter site has been
disinfected and covered with concrete in order to neutralise anthrax
spores, which can remain active in soil for decades, Askarov said.
A number of facilities in Kazakhstan were used for producing anthrax during
the Soviet era, but there was no evidence to link the current outbreak to
such sites, Askarov said.

[Equine cases of anthrax can occur independently of other livestock cases,
though they usually follow from them. Kazakhstan reports sporadic equine
cases, and in 2001 had an equine outbreak involving 2 horses. The horse
population in the country is around one million animals. The vaccination
reports to OIE are erratic, and it is hard to tell what percentage are
vaccinated each year. There are regular reports of human cases, most
frequently from southern Kazakhstan: 1998 (15), 1999 (9), 2000 (34 with 33
in the south), 2001 (13 with 11 in the south). Horsemeat is commonly eaten
in the country, so it is not at all unlikely that human cases would follow
from the butchering of a sick horse.
While long-term soil contamination is possible, it is associated with
burying carcasses, not from surface contamination, which persists for a
limited time; 3 months to 3 years is the usual duration without
disinfection. If this was a case of "shade-tree butchering," it was
probably no bad thing to concrete over the site, if only to upgrade its use
and make subsequent disinfection easier. None of the Soviet-era anthrax
plants were in southern Kazakhstan. - Mod.MHJ]
