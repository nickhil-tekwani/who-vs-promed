Utah: Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome Death in Cedar City
-------------------------------------------------------
A 41-year-old woman's death earlier this week has been confirmed as a case
of Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), Valley View Medical Center spokesman
Travis Bradburn said on Sat 8 Jun 2002. The woman, [from] Cedar City, was
admitted to the hospital on Sun 2 Jun 2002 around 8 pm complaining of
flu-like symptoms and was pronounced dead 5 hours later.
"She walked in, was alert and awake when she arrived, but she quickly
deteriorated and went into respiratory distress," Bradburn said. "[Her]
symptoms included muscle aches, fever, vomiting and shortness of breath.
Within hours her condition worsened and she was stabilized for transport by
air to a Salt Lake City hospital. The plane never left the ground. By the
time she went into respiratory distress and was returned to the emergency
room, she went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead," Bradburn said.
When [she] contracted the air-borne virus is unknown at this point, although
Bradburn said doctors do know she had been cleaning up some mouse droppings.
"People just need to be very cautious and take precautions when cleaning
this time of year, especially since it's so dry and dusty," he said.
An environmental assessment will be conducted over the next few days at the
woman's home and other places to try and determine where she may have
contracted the deadly virus, said Gary Edwards, Director of the 5 county
Southwest Utah Public Health Department. "The incubation period for this
virus is from 1 to 5 weeks," Edwards said. "That's what makes it so
dangerous. There's about a 50 percent mortality rate."
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Web site
recommends people observe several safety precautions while cleaning areas
where rodents have been. Among the precautions are wearing latex gloves,
using a detergent or other liquid to kill the virus, and not stirring up
dust that may contain mouse droppings, urine or nesting materials.

[The etiologic agent in this case is presumed to be _Sin Nombre virus_.
The number of HPS case reports is now on the increase, and such reports will
be posted from now on as periodic updates, except when the report originates
from a new state or geographical region. - Mod.CP]
