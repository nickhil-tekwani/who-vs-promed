Sudan Village Records Highest Incidence Of Sleeping Sickness
------------------------------------------------
At least 12 000 people out of a population of 60 000 in Tambura
County in the extreme south west of Southern Sudan (Western Equatoria) have
chronic sleeping sickness. This is the highest incidence of the killer
disease anywhere in the world.
While Tambura, which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) & the
Central African Republic (CAR), is the epicentre for this infection, other
districts in Equatoria such as Yambio, Yei and Maridi also suffer varying
degrees of this epidemic [as must be the adjacent areas of the DRC & CAR -
Mod.JW.
If not treated, the people afflicted will eventually die. The large number
of afflicted also means there is a substantial reservoir for this disease
and the problem is perpetuated from year to year. Treating the sick is
essentially emergency work and is carried out by the medical charity
International Medical corps. It is expensive and is accepted as a
short-term solution.
For long term eradication of this problem, the tsetse fly carrier for this
disease, particularly a species called _Glossina fuscipes_, has to be
eliminated or substantially curtailed.
In 1998, a research scientist in the tsetse behavioural biology department
at the Nairobi-based International Centre for Insect Physiology and
Entomology ICIPE, Enos Mpanga, was hired by the medical charity, Merlin,
who in turn had been contracted by CARE Sudan, to set up a sustainable
tsetse control mechanism in this badly ravaged area of Southern Sudan.
The programme incorporates the community itself as key players in the
manufacture and maintenance of simple traps for the killer insects.
According to Mr. B Allan, the coordinator of the Merlin tsetse control
programme in Tambura County, the tsetse trapping technology, while simple,
is quite new in Sudan.
This trap - the pyramid trap - is essentially made out of coloured fabric
with blue and black sectors. It was developed at the ICIPE in Kenya and
extensively tested in Kenya. The trap is suspended on lower branches of
trees about half a metre from ground level in a clearing in the bush near
areas where human beings and their livestock congregate such as fishing
points, wells and village paths.
>From a distance, the tsetse detects the blue wavelength emanating from the
blue part of the trap. It responds by coming nearer, whereupon it sees the
black part of the trap, normally the kind of surface it likes to rest on.
Eventually it will want to fly off, but is fooled by light penetrating the
fabric comprising the top part of the trap into getting lost deeper into
the device.
Allan says in order to make the project sustainable local women in the
affected counties have been taught to make the trap while local health
supervisors have been shown how to ensure the technology is correctly
applied.
"In Tambura town alone, we put up 1200 traps. The people in the area
are quite enthusiastic and have been told the importance of trapping these
flies. They also know the basic biology of this insect and that it renders
itself [amenable to control because it is a poor breeder," says Allan.
In terms of sleeping sickness, Ezo is worst hit with 30 percent of the
people there infected. This is followed by Source Yubu, Tambura (town) and
Mpoi, in that order. Mpanga has calculated that in the environment and
population dynamics of Tambura-Yambio areas of Southern Sudan, it will take
at least two years of dedicated trapping work to reduce the population of
tsetse significantly.
One major problem is that flies migrate all the way from the Central
African Republic and the Democratic Republic of Congo. On a weekly basis,
each trap catches about 2000 tsetse flies, but the number varies depending
on the total number of traps in a given area.

[This trap is not new, an early version was used in Uganda in the 1960s, but
it is an example of low-cost, appropriate technology much needed in the
developing world - Mod.JW
