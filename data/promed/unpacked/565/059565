A horse was put down in Australia after contracting the deadly Hendra
virus -- the 9th animal to die in an outbreak which has exposed almost
50 people in 2 states.

Passed from fruit bats (flying foxes) to horses and highly fatal to
humans, a 2nd case of Hendra virus was confirmed on a New South Wales
farm where 1 animal has already died and 9 people were exposed to the
virus.

"Results of laboratory tests yesterday [13 Jul 2011] revealed the
surviving horse -- which was showing signs of illness for more than 24
hours -- was carrying the Hendra virus," said chief NSW veterinarian
Ian Roth, on Thursday [14 Jul 2011].

"It is believed that the horse became infected with Hendra virus
following very close contact with the original infected horse."

At least 48 people have been exposed to Hendra virus in the past
month in an outbreak which has spread from Cairns to within 500
kilometres (300 miles) of Sydney, worrying the city's thoroughbred
race trainers.

No humans have yet been infected. Hendra has killed 4 of the 7 people
who have contracted it since it was first identified 1994, but human
infections are rare.

Named after the Brisbane suburb in which it was discovered, Hendra
virus is thought to be unique to Australia and is spread from infected
bats via half-chewed fruit or water and food contaminated by their
urine and droppings.

[The property where this horse died is reported to have had a stable
mate die on 3 Jul 2011.

It is sad to learn there are political people who want to kill the
bats responsible. However, killing the bats would likely increase the
stress and exacerbate the situation of the bats shedding more virus
and hence, resulting in more disease.

Biosecurity Queensland is handling the calls regarding questions
about eliminating bats and explaining the dire consequences of such
action
