[Following the unfortunate occurrence of deaths in individuals following
vaccination with 17DD yellow fever vaccine in Peru (see ProMED-mail posting
20071019.3417), the Pan American Health Organization convened an expert
panel to evaluate the situation. Excerpts of their report are presented
below. ProMED-mail subscribers are urged to read the entire report at the

Final statement by the Pan American Health Organization/World Health
Organization (PAHO/WHO) on investigation of serious adverse events in Peru
following receipt of yellow fever vaccine produced by Bio-Manguinhos, Brazil

Background
----------
From November 2007 - March 2008, the Pan American Health Organization and
the World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) assisted the Ministry of Health in
Peru to investigate serious adverse events, including 4 deaths, which
occurred during a yellow fever vaccination campaign from 23 Sep to 6 Oct
2007 in the Ica Region, south of Lima.

Conclusions of the expert panel
-------------------------------
The incidence of yellow fever vaccine-associated viscerotropic disease in
the Ica Region in this event is significantly higher (more than 20 times)
than observed previously in other settings. 5 cases occurred among 63 174
vaccinated persons for an overall rate of 7.9 per 100 000 [vaccinated
persons]. Previous estimates of the overall incidence are about 0.3-0.4/100
000 vaccinated persons. A number of hypotheses were considered to explain
the higher rate, and eliminated, including the possibility that the vaccine
lot 05OVFA121Z contained a genetic change responsible for enhanced
virulence and possible host factors that may have contributed to
susceptibility in the cases.

The investigation showed clinical, virological and pathological evidence of
confirmed viscerotropic disease in 4 fatal cases and probable viscerotropic
disease in one surviving case. The cause of death was an overwhelming
infection with 17DD vaccine virus, probably associated with a severe immune
response syndrome.

Multiple lines of investigation indicated that there were no changes in the
vaccine virus that were responsible for the occurrence of these cases. No
evidence could be found to suggest that the vaccine lot 05OVFA121Z had
anything inherently wrong with it to explain the higher frequency of
viscerotropic disease in persons receiving that lot.

All fatal cases had some underlying or concurrent condition that might have
contributed to the fatal outcome of the adverse events. The fact that
other, non-identified risk factors may have contributed to the increased
rate of viscerotropic disease in this region is not ruled out.

[Vaccination remains a main line defense tool against yellow fever (YF).
Recent outbreaks of YF in Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina, as well as
scattered cases in Peru, are reminders that YF, with the possibility of
massive urban epidemics, is still a real and present threat to the public's
health in endemic areas. The mosquito vector of urban YF virus
transmission, _Aedes aegypti_, is abundant in much of the tropics, and just
awaits arrival of the YF virus. - Mod.TY]
