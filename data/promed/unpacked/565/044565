Statement on the African swine fever situation in the wild boar in Lithuania
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issued by the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health held in Brussels on 6 Feb 2014

The European Commission and the EU Member States after reviewing the African swine fever situation in the wild boar in Lithuania:
- acknowledge that following the confirmation of African Swine Fever (ASF) in 2 wild boars in southern Lithuania, close to the borders with Belarus, all the appropriate measures for preventing further spread of the disease from the infected areas in Lithuania were swiftly taken;
- are pleased to see that the Lithuanian authorities are working in a cooperative manner with the Commission and the other Member States in order to develop an effective eradication plan, as foreseen in the EU legislation when ASF is confirmed in the wild boar;
- understand that the recommendations of the Community Veterinary Emergency Team together with the Guidelines on surveillance and control of ASF fever in feral pigs and preventive measures for pig holdings endorsed by this Committee in January 2014 will be fully taken into account by the Lithuanian authorities to develop their eradication plan;
- highlight that Lithuania has reassured that no live pig, reproductive material from pigs, pig meat, untreated pig products or unprocessed animal by-products from pigs from the infected area will be dispatched out of the country and that no meat nor animal by-products from wild boar from the whole of Lithuania can be dispatched from Lithuania;
- consider that the trade restrictions adopted by Lithuania in the framework of the EU legislation are appropriate to protect not only the other EU Member States but also other trade partners outside the EU;
- emphasise that the interim measures of "regionalization" adopted by Commission Implementing Decision 2014/43/EU covering the districts of Trakai, Salcininkai, Lazdijai, Varena, Alytus and Druskininkai is appropriate for the Lithuanian situation and thus those measures were endorsed by the Committee and are prolonged;
- consider that at this stage, the appropriateness of building up a fence all along the border between Lithuania and Belarus appears questionable from a cost/benefits perspective. Further scientific evidence would be needed demonstrating the possible benefits from such a fence in terms of reduction of the ASF risk for Lithuania;
- recommend that technical and scientific assistance together with appropriate financial support is made available to Lithuania and other Member States facing ASF threat under the EU principle of solidarity

[2] Epidemiology ASF -- arthropod vectors

Date: Thu 13 Feb 2014

Re: PRO/IN> African swine fever in Lithuania
--------------------------------------------
I believe that cogent reasons have already been posted as to why a massive wild boar cull is probably not going to be a useful control measure for African swine fever, so am not going to comment further on that.

I would like to point out that the advent in spring of 'birds and their mites' is certainly not going to spread the African swine fever virus. A large selection of arthropods have been investigated as potential vectors of the ASF virus. Argasid ticks of the genus _Ornithodoros_ are competent biological vectors of the virus and need not necessarily have evolved with it, since _Ornithodoros erraticus_ proved to be competent in transmission as well as in maintenance of the virus over long periods (at least 5 years) when ASF reached the Iberian Peninsula, and several species of _Ornithdoros_ in the USA and Caribbean and _O. savignyi_ in southern Africa have been shown experimentally to have the same competence, although transovarial transmission as occurs in the natural host in southern and East Africa (_Ornithodoros moubata_ complex) was not demonstrated in all species. The only other arthropod demonstrated experimentally to be able to maintain the virus for up to 48 hours and transmit it mechanically is the stable fly, _Stomoxys calcitrans_. Pig mites, _Sarcoptes scabiei_ var. _suis_, proved unable to maintain or transmit the virus. Control efforts will certainly not be assisted by the circulation of urban legends about how the virus spreads; a strong focus on the biosecurity of pig farms will go a very long way towards eliminating the risk of ASF spreading in Lithuania.

[Prof. Penrith's above authoritative contribution is much appreciated. It has been submitted in response to the following text included in a recent Lithuanian media report: "Time is of the essence, insist state veterinary officials that are overseeing the 6-month cull in the wild ending in June 2014. Come spring, the virus will spread faster as warm weather brings back birds and the mites they bear" (item 1, ProMED-mail posting 20140211.2271563).

During the 6 and 7 Feb 2014 meeting of EU's Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCFCAH), the following presentations addressing ASF in EU countries (prevention, surveillance and control), have been presented and discussed:

1. African swine fever -- Estonia
2. African Swine fever -- Latvia
3. African swine fever -- Lithuania
4. African Swine Fever -- Poland

For the above, see http://ec.europa.eu/food/committees/regulatory/scfcah/animal_health/presentations_en.htm#20140206-07.
