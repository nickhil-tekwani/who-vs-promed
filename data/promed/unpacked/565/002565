[This outbreak continues to slowly march along in Uttar Pradesh. This
report does not indicate if the new cases are due to Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) or something else. It is not clear if a
vaccination campaign against JEV has been mounted in the affected
areas. However, previous reports indicate that JEV infections account
for less than half of the cases, the etiology of the majority
remaining undiagnosed. Without a reliable diagnosis, effective
preventive measures cannot be implemented in the affected areas.
