A Correction
------------
I refer to your recent posting about the viral encephalitis case in Negri
Sembilan. As a point of clarification, specimens from the deceased were not
sent to University Hospital for testing as stated in the South China Press
Report. In any case, it should not take more than a day to get preliminary
serology results for Nipah virus or Japanese encephalitis virus infections
and certainly not 2 weeks.
I hope the Ministry of Health Malaysia will provide details of the case.

Another Correction
------------------
Regarding the posting entitled, Undiagnosed encephalitis - Malaysia
20010226.0381, I would like to comment on Moderator CP's comment (".... It
is implied that the victim may have been exposed to Nipah virus during the
1998 outbreak. If this is correct, it suggests that immunity to Nipah virus
may be short-lived. There is no evidence that Nipah virus can initiate a
persistent infection....")
However, [on the contrary there is good evidence that exactly this may be
the case with the closely related Hendra virus. O'Sullivan JD, Allworth AM,
Paterson DL, et al., Fatal encephalitis due to novel paramyxovirus
transmitted from horses (Lancet 1997;349:93-5), describe a patient who died
of encephalitis 13 months after his initial infection with Hendra virus.
Furthermore, neurological relapse has also been reported in Nipah virus
infection - see Goh et al.: Clinical features of Nipah virus encephalitis
among pig farmers in Malaysia (NEJM 342 (17): 1229-35).

Difficulties Experienced in the Follow-up of Nipah Virus Cases
--------------------------------------------------------------
A relapse of symptoms of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus/Nipah virus
infection have caused 2 deaths so far in the Bukit Pelandok area this year.
More deaths are expected if former victims do not seek follow-up treatment.
The Health Ministry has warned that former JE/Nipah victims may suffer a
relapse if they do not complete the 2-year schedule of follow-up treatment.
Its director-general, Datuk Dr. Mohamad Taha Arif, said that while there
were no new cases, 6 per cent of 280 people infected during the outbreak in
1999 had [experienced a relapse. "There is still that possibility
especially if they do not come for their follow-up [examination, but I
hope there would be no more," he told a press conference.
Dr. Mohamad Taha was concerned that of 78 patients who had turned up for
their first follow-up in July last year, only 52 returned for their second
check up, which eventually dwindled to only 20 for the third. "Efforts were
and are still being made to trace these patients. Some had moved away while
others were foreigners who may have returned home. The Ministry is
appealing to all patients to stick to their follow-up schedule and not to
drop out without completing it," he said.
Nipah virus [is a novel paramyxovirus resembling Hendra virus discovered
in Kampung Sungai Nipah, Bukit Pelanduk, during the height of the outbreak
in 1999. Dr. Mohamad Taha said health officials were also monitoring the
situation and conducting regular checks on areas that had been affected by
the outbreak. Since the Nipah virus outbreak in 1999, there had been 2
deaths reported in the media and both involved relapse cases. One was a
22-year old livestock farm assistant who died on 1 Feb 2001, and the other
was a former pig-farmer who died on 7 Feb 2001. Both were from the Bukit
Pelanduk pig-farming area near Lukut in Negri Sembilan.
The former pig farmer was a known case of Nipah encephalitis and he was
first admitted to Hospital in Kuala Lumpur on 16 Mar 1999 and displayed
residual neurological deficit on discharge. On subsequent reviews his
condition was found to have worsened and [it is presumed that he died at
home later. As for the 22-year old assistant, Dr Mohamad Taha said
investigations had revealed that he was involved in an unsupervised private
culling operation in early March 1999. This was when it was established
that the pigs were already infected with Nipah virus. It is highly probable
that he was infected during this time and subsequently he developed
prodromal symptoms in April 1999.
Dr. Mohamad Taha said initial blood tests taken from this patient after he
was admitted to the Seremban hospital on 28 Jan 2001 revealed he had
previous exposure to Nipah virus. He said health authorities were also
trying to verify the [nature of the illness suffered by the victim's
employer. We are trying to get his employer's private physician here (Kuala
Lumpur), to investigate further on how and when e he has been infected.
KL Hospital Consultant Neurologist Dr. Raihanah Abdul Khalid, who was also
present at the press conference, said follow-ups were done monthly for the
first 4 months, followed by [examinations at the sixth, ninth and twelfth
months. She said reminder letters [had been sent out to those who did not
turn up for any of the checks-ups, but so far these had been ineffective.
Dr. Raihanah said the Ministry had also extended the follow-up period
indefinitely from 2 years to learn more about the virus, [and especially to
determine if it exhibited cyclic activity.
"It is not unusual for some viruses," she said, "to linger on for a long
time even though the primary initial infection appears to have cleared up."
Mutations or some remnants of the virus can still remain and cause problems
later, she said. Dr. Raihanah said of the 280 patients infected during the
outbreak, 120 had died and of the remaining 160 patients, 126 tested Nipah
virus-positive while the rest could not be traced.

Japanese Encephalitis Virus Suspected as Cause of Death
--------------------------------------------------------
SEREMBAN: Initial investigations into the death of a livestock farm
assistant at Bukit Pelandok on 29 Jan 2001 have ruled out Nipah virus as
the cause of death and indicate Japanese encephalitis was responsible.
[However, the Health and Veterinary Services Departments are running
further tests on blood samples taken from goats at the farm where the
22-year old man had been working. Veterinary Services Department
Director-general Datuk Dr. Mohd Nordin Mohd Noor said the tests were still
inconclusive as the investigators would also need to re-affirm that the
death was not Nipah virus-related. "We do not know everything about Nipah
virus, which has been known to be carried by pigs, so we will have to look
into every possibility. For now, we can ascertain from initial findings on
the victim's death that it was not Nipah virus-related, based on our
knowledge of the virus." Asked if it was necessary to evacuate the farm's
occupants and nearby residents, Dr. Mohd Nordin said the Health Department
would ascertain the social considerations in the case following the
conclusion of its tests. He said the investigators also could not confirm
whether the victim's death was caused by the residual effects of the Nipah
virus [infection contracted by him during the Nipah outbreak at Bukit
Pelandok in 1999.
He said that livestock farmers and villagers who came across Japanese
encephalitis-like sicknesses among their livestock or people should
immediately report to the relevant authorities. He added that he had
instructed the State Veterinary Services Department to carry out
investigations at the farm and the surrounding area to determine if there
is really a cause for concern.
Meanwhile, the owner of the affected farm said officers from the department
came at 8.30 a.m. today to collect blood samples from his goats. Meanwhile,
2 experts from the Department of Medicine, Universiti Malaya, came to Bukit
Pelandok to trace former Japanese encephalitis victims who failed to
undergo follow-up checks at government hospitals. This followed the death
of a Japanese encephalitis victim, whose identity was not available, at
Bukit Pelandok last week. One of the experts, Prof. C.T. Tan, said it was
possible for people exposed to Nipah virus to suffer from residual effects.

[The Moderator is indebted to the 2 correspondents for their corrections.
The 2 press reports are confusing and indicate a divergence of opinion on
the cause of death. Some precise information on the diagnostic tests
employed would be welcome. - Mod.CP
