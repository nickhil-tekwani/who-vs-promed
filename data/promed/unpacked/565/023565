Captive elephants of Chitwan National Park have once again started dying from tuberculosis, bringing back the memories of deaths among elephants due to TB at a worrying rate.

Three domestic elephants belonging to the national park have died so far this year [2020]. The park has confirmed TB as the reason behind the deaths of 2 elephants, while the cause of the 3rd death has yet to be ascertained. The latest casualty is also linked to TB, as the elephant had been sick for a long time and had been diagnosed with TB earlier.

"The elephant had been weak and ailing for a long time. The elephant died on Sunday [15 Nov 2020]. We believe that it also died due to TB infection, but we are waiting for the final report," Ashok Kumar Ram, information officer at the Chitwan National Park, told the Post over the phone. "If this elephant is also confirmed to have died from TB, then the lung disease would have killed 3 elephants this year [2020] alone, which is a worrying sign."

Chitwan National Park has nearly 60 domesticated elephants, which support the park officials in day-to-day conservation activities. The 3 deaths have worried park officials about the danger of TB among the animals. "TB was once a major threat to these elephants during 2006-07, when many elephants were diagnosed with TB. After medication, the disease was neutralised within years. But the return of the disease among captive elephants has once again emerged as a challenge for us," said Ram.

TB can transmit from elephants to other elephants, as well as other human beings. Tuberculosis in elephants is caused primarily by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the same bacterium that is responsible for pulmonary disease in humans. Domesticated elephants pick up the bacterium from humans who get close while taking care of these tuskers, among other activities.

Concerned with the latest infections among captive elephants, the park has begun random testing of elephants to detect the zoonotic disease. For now, the rapid diagnosis test (RDT) is being conducted randomly among elephants that look sick and old. However, all the 5 dozen elephants can be screened if needed, according to Ram.

By 2007, TB had emerged as a major health hazard for the elephants kept by private owners, who use them for safari in Sauraha, and protected areas. Tests done among 200 elephants in 2012 showed that around 23 per cent of elephants belonging to the national parks and tourism entrepreneurs had TB.

According to the Chitwan National Park statistics, 61 elephants were diagnosed with TB, and treated. Out of the total 61 infected with TB, 16 had died. Another test done in 2016 showed that 9 of the 93 animals examined had the TB bacterium.

Over the years, with timely interventions, the TB infection rate among the elephants used in protected parks and by tourism entrepreneurs had declined rapidly. But the threat seems to be returning with 3 elephants from the Chitwan park succumbing to TB last year [2019] and at least 2 deaths blamed on the disease within the 1st 3 months of the current year.

Haribhadra Acharya, spokesperson for the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, the government authority responsible for management of protected parks and wildlife, is also concerned about the deaths of elephants due to TB. "In the latest case, the elephant had been sick and weak for a long time. However, this is worrisome," Acharya, who is also an ecologist with the department, told the Post. "When TB posed a major threat to these domesticated elephants around 2006-07, we saw encouraging recoveries and control in spread." Old age, workload, and insufficient diet make elephants prone to TB, Acharya said.

[Tuberculosis (TB) caused by _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_ or _Mycobacterium bovis_ has recently re-emerged as an important infectious disease in zoo animals, particularly captive elephants. While TB has been recognized as a disease of elephants for over 20 centuries, increasing numbers of elephant TB cases have been reported in the past 2 decades in the USA and elsewhere.

It would be interesting to know whether staff working in close contact with these domesticated elephants were tested for TB. - Mod.PMB
