While durums out-yielded the bread varieties, the season across the
board for all wheats has been characterised by severe infestations of
the fungal disease crown rot. Paul Parker (Industry and Investment NSW
agronomist) said the dry conditions had contributed to the disease's
virulence, but there could also be a more sinister contributing factor
emerging.

The puzzling thing was that even where crop rotations were beyond
reproach pinched grains and empty heads were still a problem. In one
of the more notable cases, crown rot still occurred despite a long
fallow/sorghum/long fallow/wheat rotation.

[Crown rot of wheat is caused in most areas (including the region
described in the item above) mainly by the fungus _Fusarium
pseudograminearum_. Other fungal species (such as _F. culmorum_) are
also reported to be associated with the disease in some locations. It
is a serious disease of cereals such as bread wheats (_Triticum
aestivum_), durum wheats (_T. turgidum_; used for example for pasta),
barley (_Hordeum vulgare_), and triticale (wheat/rye hybrids) with
reported yield losses of up to 30 percent. For example, annual losses
of AUD 56 million (USD 52.1 million) are estimated in Australia.
Infection is favoured by good crop conditions in the 1st part of the
season followed by dry conditions during flowering and grain filling.
These conditions lead to the production of 'deadheads' or 'whiteheads'
containing pinched seed or no seed at all.

The pathogen survives from one season to the next on infected crop
stubble and other plant debris. Spores can be spread by wind,
contaminated materials, and mechanical means. Crown rot incidence
increases with continuous cropping of wheat and conservation cropping.
Disease management may include control of grassy reservoir hosts, crop
rotation with broad-leaf non-hosts (for example brassicas), and
burning of infected stubble. Some tolerant varieties of bread wheat
are available, but effective genetic resistance in the highly
susceptible durum wheats as well as in barley still needs to be
identified. Resistance breeding programmes are ongoing.

Reasons for the apparent failure of crop rotation reported above are
unclear, but the possibilities of crop infection from sources outside
the field, or a pathogen strain with increased viability and/or
virulence could be considered.
