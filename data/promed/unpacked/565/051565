The Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture promised last week it would take steps
to control an outbreak of foot and mouth disease which has killed hundreds
of sheep in the Baalbek-Hermel region. A local ministry official said
vaccines for 2000 sheep have been secured and the drive would begin Monday.
Talal Rifai, the head of the Ministry's Animal Production Center in Hermel,
said that since foot and mouth was a viral disease and highly contagious,
the only way to contain an outbreak was to vaccinate unaffected sheep.
However, if a sheep was already infected, the vaccine was useless. He added
lambs were particularly susceptible and it was extremely important to
vaccinate pregnant ewes.
"The high number of deaths among herds this year was because the disease hit
earlier than in previous years," he said. "Sheep usually catch foot and
mouth in the spring." The disease causes high fever and paralysis in the
mouth, making it impossible for the sheep to eat, and they eventually die of
starvation.

[Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) is a highly infectious viral infection. It is
characterized by fever, vesicles in the mouth, on the muzzle, teats and
feet, and death in young animals. The vesicles are very painful and limit
the ability of the animal to eat or to move to food or water. Transmission
of FMD is generally by contact between susceptible and infected animals.
Secretions and excretions of infected animals contain the virus. Respiratory
and oral routes of infection are possible. FMD is antigenically diverse,
which can be a problem because although vaccination provides good
protection, the vaccine must contain strains antigenically similar to the
outbreak strain. Currently there are no alternatives to vaccine antigens
derived from whole virus grown in tissue culture and then chemically
inactivated - Mod.TG
