Hong Kong health authorities report monitoring a human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in a 54-year-old woman living in Zigong, Sichuan Province. The woman had exposure to deceased backyard poultry before the onset of symptoms. She developed symptoms on 17 Nov 2021, was admitted for treatment on 21 Nov 2021, and died on 23 Nov 2021.

This is the 27th human case reported on Mainland China in the past year and the 52nd case reported since the 1st case was reported in 2014. Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks.

Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flulike symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches), or severe respiratory illness (e.g., chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.

The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multiorgan failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.

People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

A woman in China's Sichuan province died from the H5N6 strain of avian influenza last month [November 2021], a regional health bureau said this week, in the latest human fatality from the lethal disease.

The 54-year-old woman from Zigong city developed symptoms on 17 Nov 2021 and was admitted to hospital on 21 Nov 2021. She died on 23 Nov 2021, according to a Wednesday [8 Dec 2021] statement on the website of the health bureau of semi-autonomous region Macau. She had been exposed to dead poultry before the onset of illness, it added.

The number of people in China infected with H5N6 bird flu this year [2021] has jumped, raising concern among experts, who say a previously circulating strain appears to have changed and may be more infectious to people (https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/rise-human-bird-flu-cases-china-shows-risk-fast-changing-variants-health-experts-2021-10-26/).

Of 26 infections reported by various government departments this year [2021], most have been in Sichuan province, though cases have also been reported in neighboring Chongqing and Guangxi, as well as Guangdong, Anhui and Hunan provinces.

According to a report from the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission on 11 Dec 2021, Huizhou City has reported one case of H5N6. The patient [W], male, 68 years old, from Huizhou City, currently lives in Huicheng District, Huizhou City, and is currently undergoing active treatment in a designated hospital in Huizhou City.

Experts judged that the case this time was an accidental case, and the risk of transmission of the virus is low at this stage. Experts remind: In winter and spring, H5N6, H9N2 and other epidemic-prone seasons, citizens should continue to stay vigilant and take the following measures to prevent H5N6 and other bird flu.

Wash your hands frequently: wash your hands after touching poultry, before eating, and after going to the toilet. To be cooked: poultry and eggs must be cooked before eating. Seek medical attention early: If you have respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, headache, and general malaise, you should go to the nearest medical and health institution as soon as possible. If you have been in contact with poultry before, you should take the initiative to tell your doctor. Do not eat dead poultry meat. Do not buy poultry and bird products of unknown origin. Avoid going to live poultry markets as much as possible.

The health authority in southern China's Guangdong Province said on Saturday [11 Dec 2021] that a human case infected with the H5N6 strain of bird flu had been reported in Huizhou City. The Guangdong Province Health Commission said in a statement that experts consider the risk of transmission to be low at this stage.

Still, he said experts have advised citizens to remain vigilant and take preventive measures such as avoiding visiting markets with live poultry, as infections with the H5N6 and H9N2 viruses are likely to occur during the winter and spring.

The 68-year-old infected man was being treated in a hospital, the statement said. The number of people infected with H5N6 bird flu in China this year [2021] has jumped, raising concern among some experts, who say a strain that was previously circulating appears to have changed and could be more contagious to humans.

Several H5N6 infections in China have died this year [2021], according to local government statements and WHO reports.
