Nicaragua: Concern about the High Rate of Dengue Fever
------------------------------------------------------
MANAGUA: Nicaraguan Health Ministry officials on Monday expressed their
concern about the high incidence of dengue fever this year that has already
resulted in 11 deaths. Juan Jose Amador, head of epidemiology at the
Nicaraguan Health Ministry, said 4 people have died due to dengue fever
since September alone, increasing dengue-related fatalities to 11 thus far
this year and exceeding the number of deaths the disease caused over the
same period last year. "If this activity continues, we will have a higher
mortality rate this year, because total deaths last year were 12," Amador
said, adding that confirmed cases of the more serious hemorrhagic dengue
fever have risen to 222, much higher than the 91 cases reported over the
first 11 months of last year. Some 1390 cases of dengue fever have been
reported in Nicaragua so far this year, up considerably from the 741 cases
reported during the same time period in 2000.
Amador explained that most cases of dengue fever are reported in the
autonomous Caribbean region of Masaya, located southeast of the capital,
the western province of Chinandega and Greater Managua. Health Minister
Maria Angeles Arguello has allocated an additional $55 000 for spraying and
clean-up efforts aimed at eradicating the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito that
transmits the disease. Spokesmen from the Managua children's hospital said
they are treating 10 suspected cases of hemorrhagic dengue fever but lack
the proper medication needed to cure the disease.

Panama: Sixth Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Case Causes Alarm
--------------------------------------------------------
PANAMA CITY: The sixth case of dengue hemorrhagic fever in the province of
Panama was confirmed on Tue 13 Nov 2001 by Panamanian Health Minister
Fernando Gracia, who appeared alarmed over the possible existence in the
country of 3 more cases. Gracia told a news conference that 2 of the dengue
cases of the deadly hemorrhagic type are currently under investigation in
this province and a third case was reported in the Chiriqui province,
bordering Costa Rica. The minister said that: "This definitely indicates a
dengue fever epidemic in Panama; so, both community and society have to
collaborate in the elimination of the [breeding grounds of the _Aedes
aegypti_ mosquito."
According to figures issued by the Health Ministry, there were 317 classic
dengue cases in Panama in 2000, including one hemorrhagic type and no
deaths were reported, compared to the 6 hemorrhagic-type and 698 classic
cases registered this year. Dengue is a painful disease characterized by
headaches, rashes, cramps and severe back and muscle pains. It usually
lasts about 2 weeks after infection and can be fatal if treatment is delayed.

Hawaii: Dengue Fever Warning for Visitors
-----------------------------------------
Visitors to the Hawaiian island of Maui will be getting an unusual type of
aloha greeting in the coming weeks: a warning about dengue fever on the
eastern portion of the island. The number of confirmed cases in Hawaii has
reached 74, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in
Atlanta confirming the first case of the mosquito-borne illness on the "big
island" of Hawaii. So far 56 of the cases have been on Maui, where the
first locally transmitted cases of dengue appeared in early September. The
CDC said that it was the first outbreak of dengue in Hawaii in more than 56
years.
Officials said the chance of travelers contracting the mosquito-borne
illness is slim, but is not unheard of in places where the disease exists.
Symptoms of the rarely fatal viral disease include severe headache, fever
and rash. The CDC said there is no vaccine for preventing dengue, but
visitors to areas where it may occur should protect themselves from
mosquito bites by using repellents, wearing long-sleeved shirts and other
covering, and relying on screened windows to avoid contact.
Health officials plan to distribute warnings through car-rental agencies,
hotels and tour operators. Some roads in the affected area were closed
because of large mosquito populations, including roads leading to
Wainapanapa State Park near Hana, Kahanu Gardens, and Blue Pool waterfall.
