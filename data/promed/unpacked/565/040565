Abra on alert vs FMD spread
------------------------------------------
Provincial authorities have put up measures to curb the spread of the
foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) after hogs in 4 barangays [communities] were
found positive for one of its strains.
Veterinarian Diosdado Taverner, head of the provincial task force on FMD,
said blood samples of hogs from barangays Cosili East, Cosili West, Calaba,
and Zone 7 were sent to the Bureau of Animal Industry in Quezon City, and
tests showed they were positive for the "O" strain of the livestock disease.
The FMD virus was traced to 30 hogs from La Union early last month. The
animals became ill, forcing local agriculture officials to kill and dispose
of them.
La Union authorities, however, denied there was an FMD outbreak in their
province, saying the hogs could have been infected while being transported.

[Philippines is regarded by the OIE as a Member Country having an FMD-free
zone where vaccination is not practised, according to the provisions of
Chapter 2.1.1. of the International Animal Health Code. The said free zone
includes Mindanao, Visayas, Palawan, and Masbate. In other areas, FMD type
O1 has been reported in recent years -- for the last time in 2001 -- mainly
affecting pigs. - Mod.AS]
