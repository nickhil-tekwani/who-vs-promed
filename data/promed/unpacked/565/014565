Experts from the School of Tropical Medicine in Kolkata have found
chikungunya antibody in the blood samples collected from 4 of the 17
children who died recently in the Karandighi block of North Dinajpur
district. The experts have also detected encephalitis antibody in the
blood sample of a family member of one of the victims. [Presumably
Japanese encephalitis virus antibody. - Mod.TY]

The 17 children succumbed to the unknown disease at Choto Burihan,
Bado Burihan, Rasakhoa, Gopalpur, Gayeshpur and Rudel villages in
Karandighi block last month [June 2008] and now the experts suspect
the disease either was chikungunya or encephalitis.

The development has triggered panic among the residents and they are
all looking towards the health department for relief. According to
the health department officials, following the spread of the
mysterious disease and successive child deaths last month, experts
from the School of Tropical Medicine, Kolkata, National Institute of
Virology Department, Pune and National Institute of Communicable
Diseases, New Delhi visited the affected areas and collected blood
samples and serum from the affected children along with water samples
of the area.

According to district Deputy Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr.
Dipak Kumar Bhowmick, the experts from the School of Tropical
Medicine in Kolkata have not confirmed the disease as either
chikungunya or encephalitis. "The experts have suspected these
diseases after antibodies were detected in the samples collected from
the family members of some of the victims," he said.

"Specialists of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases in
New Delhi recently collected samples of the affected children along
with water samples but have not been able to come to any conclusion
about the origin of the disease."

The doctors, however, said that treatment of the victims could not be
initiated since the origin of the disease remains unknown.

[This article provides some additional information concerning this
outbreak. The death toll has increased from 2 to 17, and some
laboratory testing is in progress. The presence of chikungunya virus
or Japanese encephalitis virus antibodies in single serum samples is
not diagnostic unless IgM antibody is demonstrated, and simply
indicates that the positive individuals have been exposed to the
virus at some time in the past. Second, convalescent, samples of a
pair may be more informative, although with the caution that
flavivirus antibody is notoriously cross-reactive with other members
of that virus family. The number of fatalities makes it unlikely that
chikungunya virus infection is involved in this outbreak. The case
fatality rate in chikungunya virus infections is extremely low, and
often nil in major outbreaks. The information provided thus far is
still not sufficient to suggest which etiological agent is involved
with these cases. ProMEd will be interested in receiving additional
information as it becomes available.
