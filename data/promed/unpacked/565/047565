Thanks for the RFI. What was initially regarded as mysterious wholesale deaths in Kano has been confirmed to be related to COVID-19. Even when there were controversial reports from government quarters, and the deaths conflated with malaria and meningitis, many health professionals, in the trenches, that I spoke with were unequivocal in their conclusions that this is caused by COVID-19. Many of the victims were reported to be above 60 and generally have respiratory distress as a core symptom, among others, which is not consistent with malarial and meningitis symptoms. Thankfully, the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, has now confirmed, after initial tentativeness, that more than 60% of the deaths could be linked to COVID-19.

It is true that over 1000 deaths were recorded in Kano within the space of 3 weeks in April 2020. What was common among those that died were underlying chronic diseases. There were 3 bodies tested that were positive [presumably for SARS-CoV-2 virus]. Government has set up a committee to investigate the cause of the deaths. Outcome of the investigation is not yet known.

Speaking yesterday [11 Jun 2020] on the report of the federal government's fact-finding team sent to Kano State to investigate the strange deaths in the state, the Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, told journalists during the briefing by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja that the final report showed that a total of 979 deaths were recorded in 8 municipal councils in the state at the rate of 43 deaths per day.

From reports, about 60% of the deaths in Kano State, Nigeria, were due to COVID-19, according to the Health Minister. The report is given below:

Updated: 9 Jun 2020
About 60% of Kano's strange deaths linked to COVID-19

The Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, on Monday [8 Jun 2020] said investigation suggests that 50-60% of the strange deaths in Kano may have been triggered by or are due to COVID-19. Ehanire disclosed this at the daily COVID-19 Presidential Task Force briefing in Abuja.

The minister said the Federal Ministry of Health received the report of the Ministerial Task Team that went to Kano to support the COVID-19 response with commodities, training, technical, and confidence-building measures this morning:

"Concerning unexplained deaths in Kano that occurred in April [2020], the team confirmed from graveyard records that a total of 979 deaths were recorded in 8 municipal LGAs [local government areas] in the state at a rate of 43 deaths per day, with a peak in the 2nd week of April [2020].

"By the beginning of May [2020], the death rate had reduced to the 11 deaths per day it used to be. The verbal autopsy revealed that about 56% of deaths had occurred at home, while 38% were in a hospital. With circumstantial evidence as all to go by, investigation suggests that between 50-60% of the deaths may have been triggered by or due to COVID-19, in the face of preexisting ailments. Most fatalities were over 65 years of age.

"The visit was extended to fact-finding excursions to offer support to 5 other states. With the observations and recommendations from the 3-week assignment, the committee developed a Strategic Incident Action Plan to strengthen the coordination capacity of the health workers and improve community engagement in line with our response plan. While over 150 health workers had been infected at the time of their arrival, there was no report of infection among health workers who had received training on infection prevention and control, thus restoring confidence. The intervention of the ministerial task force has been a game-changer for Kano and some northern states."

[ProMED thanks the EpiCore network for comments relating to undiagnosed deaths in Kano State, Nigeria. All the above EpiCore reports confirm that there were hundreds of deaths in Kano State, peaking in April [2020] but continuing on for several weeks. The 1st EpiCore response indicates that the previously reported approximate 40% of deaths not attributed to SARS-CoV-2 virus infections were, in fact, due to that virus, but complicated by co-morbidities that contributed to their deaths. That many SARS-CoV-2 deaths implies that an epidemic of this virus occurred in the population, perhaps with well over 1000 infected individuals who did not die. It is not clear how many of the fatal cases were laboratory tested for SARS-CoV-2 virus or other pathogens. The individuals who died at home doubtless were not tested. - Mod.TY
