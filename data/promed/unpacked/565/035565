107 babies die from mysterious fever in Nyala, South Darfur
-----------------------------------------------------------
The death toll from a yet identified fever has risen to 107 infants
in Nyala, South Darfur State. Between March and May [2010], 988
babies have been infected with the raging fever which can inflict
death within 48 hours of delivery. Miraya's correspondent in Nyala
toured the town's main hospital and described the situation as
catastrophic, observing that 2 to 3 newborn babies share a bed.

Lack of air-conditioning coupled by Nyala's scorching temperatures
have aggravated the overcrowded hospital, causing a stench to pervade
the wards.

Speaking to Radio Miraya, Head of Nyala hospital, Dr Mubarak
Abdelrahman, said that pollution in the area surrounding the birth
centres or homes, polluted water, or temperature rises could be some
probable causes of the yet unidentified fever.

According to Miraya correspondent in Nyala, the State health
authorities have requested the Federal Minister of Health, United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the World Health Organization
(WHO) to assist in identifying the disease.

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Sharon Sanders at FluTrackers for
alerting us to this ongoing outbreak.

The differential diagnosis of febrile fatal illnesses in neonates
includes overwhelming viral or bacterial sepsis. In the absence of
laboratory studies, a precise diagnosis is difficult to make or
speculate at this time.

More information on this outbreak from knowledgeable sources in the
region would be greatly appreciated.
