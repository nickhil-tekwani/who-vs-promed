The Seychelles, which has fully vaccinated over 60% of its population against Covid-19, is bringing back restrictions amid a rise in cases. The archipelago of nearly 100 000 people recorded close to 500 new cases in the 3 days to [1 May 2021] and has about 1000 active cases.

A 3rd of the active cases involved people who had had 2 vaccine doses, the country's news agency said. The rest had either had a single dose or were unvaccinated.

Schools have been closed and sports activities cancelled for 2 weeks. Bars, restaurants and shops are to close early and some gatherings have been banned. "Despite all the exceptional efforts we are making, the Covid-19 situation in our country is critical right now with many daily cases reported last week," health minister Peggy Vidot told a press conference on [Tue 4 May 2021].

More than four-fifths of the active cases were among Seychellois people, with the remainder made up of foreigners.

The Seychelles, which relies on tourism for much of its income, began vaccinating its population in January using Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine doses donated by the United Arab Emirates. By mid-April [2021] about 60% of the vaccine doses administered in the country were Sinopharm, with the rest Indian-made AstraZeneca vaccine doses, Bloomberg reported.

Trials in China and the United Arab Emirates have put Sinopharm vaccine efficacy at 79% and 86%, respectively. The World Health Organization is expected to approve the Sinopharm vaccine and other Chinese-made vaccines for use later this week. In April [2021], China's top disease control official said the efficacy of the country's Covid vaccines was low, although he later insisted his comments had been misinterpreted.

Researchers in Brazil have put the efficacy of another Chinese-made vaccine, the Sinovac vaccine, at 50.4%.

[It would be helpful to know which vaccine the individuals received and their immunization status, who were fully vaccinated but are getting reinfected. It is not clear whether these were unsuccessful vaccinations (Sinopharm is estimated to be 79--86% effective) or whether it is inability of successfully immunized individuals to be protected from infection with variants. A 3rd of the active cases involved people who had 2 vaccine doses, and Sinopharm was used in 60% of the vaccinations, Indian-made AstraZeneca, the remainder. - Mod.LK

On [Tue 4 May 2021], the Seychelles news agency reported: "There are currently 1068 active cases numbers, among which 84% are Seychellois and 16% are foreigners. Some 65% of the active cases are unvaccinated or have received only one dose, whilst the remaining have taken both doses. To date over 59 600 persons have received both doses of vaccines, representing 85% of the targeted population."

At least 2 vaccines (both requiring 2 doses) have been used: Sinopharm (donated by the UAE) and Covishield (donated by India, and also known as the AstraZeneca vaccine).

Data are not yet available from Seychelles on virus sequencing and variants in [April 2021], especially important in order to compare viruses in persons fully vaccinated (2 doses) vs 1 dose vs. unvaccinated. Nor are data publicly available on the degree of clinical severity in these patients who have been fully or partially vaccinated. A comparison between Sinopharm, Covishield, and unvaccinated infected persons could then be done using genetic sequencing and clinical outcome data.

In February [2021] the variant B.1.351 was confirmed in a small number of patients in Seychelles.

Earlier this year [2021] South Africa decided not to use the AstraZeneca vaccine due to a very low efficacy in preventing infection with the B.1.351 variant initially found in South Africa.

Given the widespread international use of these 2 vaccines there are global implications to what is happening now in the Seychelles e.g., international travel, mass gatherings events whether religious, musical, or the Olympics (Japan July 2021 and China February 2022). The variant B.1.351 or a novel variant must be ruled out as soon as possible by large-scale genetic sequencing, perhaps in the renowned laboratories in South Africa that have been performing sequencing for other nations in Africa.

[2] Vaccine: Sinovac
Date: Wed 13 Jan 2021 [ProMED regrets the delay in posting]
Source: BBC [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55642648


A coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinovac has been found to be 50.4% effective in Brazilian clinical trials, according to the latest results released by researchers. It shows the vaccine is significantly less effective than previous data suggested - barely over the 50% needed for regulatory approval.

The Chinese vaccine is one of 2 that the Brazilian government has lined up. Brazil has been one of the countries worst affected by Covid-19.

Sinovac, a Beijing-based biopharmaceutical company, is behind CoronaVac, an inactivated vaccine. It works by using killed viral particles to expose the body's immune system to the virus without risking a serious disease response. Several countries, including Indonesia, Turkey and Singapore, have placed orders for the vaccine.

Last week [w/e 10 Jan 2021] researchers at the Butantan Institute, which has been conducting the trials in Brazil, announced that the vaccine had a 78% efficacy against "mild-to-severe" Covid-19 cases. But on Tue [12 Jan 2021] they revealed that calculations for this figure did not include data from a group of "very mild infections" among those who received the vaccine that did not require clinical assistance.

With the inclusion of this data, the efficacy rate is now 50.4%, said researchers. But Butantan stressed that the vaccine is 78% effective in preventing mild cases that needed treatment and 100% effective in staving off moderate to serious cases.

The Sinovac trials have yielded different results across different countries. Last month Turkish researchers said the Sinovac vaccine was 91.25% effective, while Indonesia, which rolled out its mass vaccination programme on [Wed 13 Jan 2021], said it was 65.3% effective. Both were interim results from late-stage trials.

[It doesn't appear the Seychelles is going to bring onboard Sinovac vaccine, but its effectiveness is reported to vary depending by country. It is not clear why the range is so large -- that is, from 65.3% (Turkey) successful to 91.25% (Indonesia). - Mod.LK]

[3] Nepal: Everest base camp
Date: Wed 5 May 2021
Source: BBC [edited]
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56984320


Mountaineers and authorities at Everest base camp in Nepal have told the BBC they are seeing rising numbers of climbers with Covid-19 symptoms and rising numbers of positive tests, raising fears of a serious outbreak. Base camp officials said they had received reports of 17 confirmed cases from hospitals in the capital Kathmandu, where a number of climbers have been sent from the base camp and higher camps to be treated.

And staff at a private hospital in Kathmandu, the CIWEC clinic, confirmed to the BBC that patients had tested positive for coronavirus after arriving from Everest base camp.

The Nepalese government has so far denied having any knowledge of positive cases at Everest base camp, raising concerns that officials are downplaying the extent of the situation out of fear it will bring more pressure to close the mountain to expeditions. Foreign climbers are a major source of revenue for the Nepalese government, which shut Everest last year [2020] during the pandemic.

Authorities are mandating that visiting climbers quarantine in Nepal before proceeding to base camp, but concerns have been raised within the climbing community that a serious outbreak at the mountain would be devastating.

The number of coronavirus cases has risen sharply in Nepal in recent weeks, and the country has the highest rate of infection among the countries neighbouring India, where a 2nd wave has sparked a full-blown crisis.

Officials from Nepal's Department of Tourism, which directly oversees expeditions, could not be reached for comment, but Prem Subedi, the under-secretary at Nepal's Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, told the BBC the ministry was not aware of any coronavirus cases at base camp. "None of the Covid cases at Everest base camp have been reported so far to the Ministry of Tourism," he said.

The Himalayan Rescue Association, which runs a government-authorised medical clinic at the base camp, told the BBC it had received confirmation of positive cases in some climbers flown out to Kathmandu by expedition teams. "We have just received from Kathmandu confirmation of 17 positive cases [in climbers flown out of Everest]," said Lhakpa Nuru Sherpa, an official with the Himalayan Rescue Association. "We have now asked expedition teams to 1st let us know before they fly out their members [to Kathmandu] who fall ill so that we know what is going on," he said.

Lhakpa Nuru Sherpa's colleague at the Everest base camp clinic, Dr Prakash Kharel, said the number of people showing coronavirus-like symptoms, such as a persistent cough and fever, is rising daily. "Almost all climbers get a cough here, but we are seeing people with other symptoms, and we are making sure that they stay in isolation," Dr Kharel said.

The CIWEC clinic in Kathmandu also confirmed to the BBC that it had seen Covid-positive climbers come to them as patients from Everest. "We did have patients come to us from the Everest region who tested positive at our hospital a couple of weeks back," said staff member Astha Pant. "We cannot share how many people or any other information at this time."

One of the big expedition teams, who asked not to be named, told the BBC that some of their members had previously tested positive, but had now recovered. A Norwegian climber, Erlend Ness, told the BBC that he had tested positive for the virus 3 times in 2 different hospitals in Kathmandu last month [April 2021].

Ness was initially thought to be suffering from altitude sickness but was diagnosed with coronavirus after being airlifted from base camp. Climbers have raised fears that coronavirus symptoms would be mistaken for the similar effects of being at altitude. "You can hear people coughing everywhere," Lukas Furtenbach, team leader of Furtenbach Adventures, told the BBC from base camp. "But this is not just the regular cough that mountaineers catch here. You can make it out that people are in pain and they have other symptoms like fever and body aches."

According to the website of the Department of Tourism, the government had issued 394 Everest climbing permits for this climbing season, as of [26 Apr 2021]. That would allow more than 1500 people to be on the mountain, the majority of them support staff.

Officials at Everest base camp said there was also concern over climbers coming back from Kathmandu either after Covid treatment or after acclimatisation rotation to adjust to the altitude. "They may have recovered themselves but they might bring the virus along with them as things are getting serious in Kathmandu," said the army official. "We have therefore recommended that climbers do the rotation acclimatisation at places below the base camp, instead of going to Kathmandu."

Mountaineers and officials at the Everest base camp also said that the lack of a coronavirus testing facility at the base camp health clinic was a major handicap. "We had requested a testing facility but the government said they could not give the permission," said Dr Kharel.

Some of the big expedition teams have said they have brought their own testing kits to Everest base camp, which has helped them to take timely steps like isolating people and evacuating them.

Himalayan Rescue Association officials said they had only recently received the confirmed reports of 17 positive coronavirus cases in climbers from Everest base camp. "It is unfortunate that we have not been receiving the details of the confirmed cases and the identities of the climbers all this time," an army official at the base camp told the BBC. "That would have helped us in contact tracing and containing the spread much earlier," he said. "We could have then isolated the climbers who had come in contact with those who tested positive much earlier."

[This is a big problem with "1500 people to be on the mountain, the majority of them support staff". The Sherpas and tourists both are at risk, and the virus could spread rapidly through both communities as symptoms are not COVID-specific. Furthermore, without testing before beginning a climb, the deprivation of O2 as altitude increases may exacerbate disease pathology as some investigators conclude from other studies, while others felt it is protective. A selection of references follow presenting both perspectives.

Quarantine in Nepal before proceeding to base camp will not prevent spread of the virus already circulating in the camp. This is a situation where rapid tests would be very helpful.
