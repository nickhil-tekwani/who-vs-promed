A Moderator's comment on the vectors of trypanosomiasis and onchocerciasis in
Nigeria
--------------------------------------------------
Central Nigeria, in particularly the Jos Plateau, has historically suffered
outbreaks of sleeping sickness, with a particularly serious outbreak in
1930. The vectors of the Gambian form of trypanosomiasis belong to the
_palpalis_ group of tsetse flies, with _Glossina palpalis_ as the main
vector but with _G. tachinoides_ as a more localised vector near streams in
areas too hot and dry for the survival of _G. palpalis_. Tsetse flies are
unusual among flies (_Diptera_) because they do not lay eggs but deposit a
mature larva on the soil which rapidly buries itself and then turns into a
puparium (similar to a pupa), and only after 3-5 weeks does the adult fly
emerge. Both male and female tsetse fly bite and can therefore be vectors.
NITR, formerly WAITR (West African Institute of Trypanosomiasis Research),
has long had an excellent record of research on tsetse flies and human
trypanosomiasis.
Control measures are always aimed at the adults and include aerial spraying
with insecticides such as deltamethrin, the deployment of attractant traps
that catch host-seeking flies, or visually attractive targets (e.g strips
of blue cloth) that do not catch flies but kill them -- as the cloth is
impregnated with insecticides.
In contrast, onchocerciasis is transmitted by simuliid blackflies which
breed in streams and rivers. In sub-Saharan Africa the main vectors belong
to the _Simulium damnosum_ complex, which comprises about 40 cytoforms,
several of which have been given formal scientific names. Larvae and pupae
of the _S. damnosum_ complex are usually found in whitewaters or
fast-flowing rivers. Only female adult flies take blood-meals, but they can
fly long distances (15-30 km) in search of blood-meals, and sometimes
become dispersed by the wind up to 400-600 km from their larval habitats.
Unlike tsetse flies, control of simuliid flies is directed against the
aquatic larvae, mainly by dosing rivers with organophosphate insecticides
or the microbial insecticide _Bacillus thuringiensis_ var. _israelensis_.
Since 1988 the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (launched in 1974) has
undertaken large-scale distribution of the microfilaricidal drug ivermectin
(Mectizan), given orally once or twice a year, in addition to insecticidal
dosing of rivers. In 1995 the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control
(APOC) was created to cover people at risk in 19 countries outside the OCP
area, such as Nigeria.
