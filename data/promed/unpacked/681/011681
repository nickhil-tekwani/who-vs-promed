New equine EEE, WNV cases confirmed across country
--------------------------------------------------
Summer might be winding down in some areas of the country, but the number of equine mosquito-borne disease cases continues to rise. Animal health officials in California, Kentucky, and Vermont have all issued statements regarding newly confirmed cases of either eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) or West Nile virus (WNV) in the past week.

The USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) reported 87 cases of WNV and 60 cases of EEE in US horses in 2011. As of 4 Sep 2012, APHIS has reported 181 cases of WNV and 112 cases of EEE throughout the nation.

California
----------
The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) yesterday (17 Sep 2012) announced that 5 additional WNV cases were confirmed in 3 counties.

"The CDFA Animal Health Branch confirmed 5 additional cases of WNV ... in Calaveras, Kern, and Shasta counties," a statement read. "All 5 horses were unvaccinated. One of the 5 horses was euthanized."

The CDFA reports that 16 California horses in 11 counties -- Butte, Calaveras, Fresno (2), Glenn, Kern, Merced, Sacramento (2), San Joaquin (2), Shasta (3), Stanislaus, and Yolo -- have now tested positive for WNV in 2012. 5 of the 16 have been euthanized.

Kentucky
--------
In Kentucky, Equine Programs Manager ES "Rusty" Ford announced 13 Sep 2012 that a yearling Standardbred filly from Bourbon County had tested positive for WNV. The filly is the 2nd WNV-positive horse in Bourbon County this year.

Ford said the filly is responding well to treatment. He noted that the "farm's population received 2012 WNV vaccines around 30 Aug 2012; younger stock with no vaccination history have a vaccine booster pending."

Kentucky has confirmed 11 WNV cases on 10 premises in 9 counties (Bourbon, Franklin, Henderson, Henry, Laurel, Metcalfe, Scott, Shelby, and Warren) so far this year [2012]. 6 are recovering while 5 have been euthanized. Ford reported that 7 affected horses were unvaccinated, 3 were partially vaccinated, and 1 was reportedly vaccinated.

Vermont
-------
Vermont animal health officials confirmed Friday (14 Sep 2012) the state's 1st-ever case of EEE.

"The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food, and Markets was notified on 14 Sep 2012 that a horse located in Whiting has tested positive for EEE," a news release stated. "The horse was not vaccinated for EEE. This case represents the 1st time that a horse has tested positive for EEE in Vermont." The state has not reported any equine WNV cases this year [2012].

Clinical signs for WNV include flulike signs, where the horse seems mildly anorexic and depressed; fine and coarse muscle and skin fasciculations (twitching); hyperesthesia (hypersensitivity to touch and sound); changes in mentation (mentality), when horses look like they are daydreaming or "just not with it"; occasional somnolence (drowsiness); propulsive walking (driving or pushing forward, often without control); and "spinal" signs, including asymmetrical weakness. Some horses show asymmetrical or symmetrical ataxia. Equine mortality rate can be as high as 30-40 percent.

A viral disease, EEE affects the central nervous system and is transmitted to horses by infected mosquitoes. Its fatality rate in horses is 75-95 percent. The course of EEE can be swift, with death occurring 2 to 3 days after onset of clinical signs despite intensive care. Horses that survive might have long-lasting impairments and neurologic problems. Clinical signs of EEE include moderate to high fever, depression, lack of appetite, cranial nerve deficits (facial paralysis, tongue weakness, difficulty swallowing), behavioral changes (aggression, self-mutilation, or drowsiness), gait abnormalities, or severe central nervous system signs, such as head-pressing, circling, blindness, and seizures.

Vaccinations are available for both diseases, and the American Association of Equine Practitioners recommends all horses receive both annually. Horses with clinical signs of WNV or EEE should be evaluated by a veterinarian immediately.

[The APHIS website provides some graphs regarding EEE and the trend of this particular disease this year (2012). http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahss/equine/ee/2011_eastern_equine_encephalitis_final.pdf.

The distribution of cases (EEE) reported in 2012 may be found at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/nahss/equine/ee/2012_equine_eee_cases_updated_09042012.pdf. This year's equine case reporting to date is still within the range seen for most years, with the exception of 2006 and 2011 when there were fewer cases reported.

But what continues to be remarkable is that people still rebel or forget to vaccinate their equine pets and companions. The horrible death these animals endure from this disease should be compelling to every equine owner to vaccinate their horses. - Mod.TG]
