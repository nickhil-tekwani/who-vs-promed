Arizona: Suspected Norovirus Outbreak Affects Missionary Group
--------------------------------------------------
Nearly 30 missionaries returning from the Navajo Reservation likely
contracted a stomach virus in Arizona that caused them to be briefly
quarantined in Pittsburgh after their flight from Phoenix landed on Sun 6
Jul 2003. Authorities speculated that the virus was a norovirus, a member
of the _Caliciviridae_, a family of common intestinal viruses. Noroviruses
have caused havoc on Grand Canyon trips every year, and an outbreak last
year killed an Ahwatukee teen and sickened more than 70 teen golfers during
a tournament at a golf course in south Phoenix.
"Everyone in this group said they had started getting sick on Sat 5 Jul
2003," said Guillermo Cole, a spokesman for Allegheny County
Health Department in Pennsylvania, which investigated the sickness after
the plane landed in Pittsburgh en route to Charlotte, North Carolina "We
know it didn't come on the plane."
While many of the passengers aboard US Air Flight 150 showed the classic
[gastroenteritis] symptoms of norovirus infection, all were checked by
paramedics at the Pittsburgh airport and pronounced fit to continue traveling.
