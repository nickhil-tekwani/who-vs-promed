[Peru had similar small-scale outbreaks in 2008 when 2 farms in
Arequipa and Cusco regions reported outbreaks and again in 2009 when
Ancash and Tacna regions reported 3 outbreaks. Also, of note, is that
we can assume these are mostly likely chickens as they are referred
to as "backyard" or "fighting" but the report only refers to them as birds.

The map provided in the OIE report can be zoomed in to see the
location of the current outbreak and the associated administrative
divisions. The 5 administrative divisions, called regions, range over
large parts of the country, with the current outbreak being the
furthest north. - Mod.PC]
