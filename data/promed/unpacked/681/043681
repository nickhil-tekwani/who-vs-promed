Chagas disease after organ transplant
-------------------------------------
Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite _Trypanosoma cruzi_.
Chagas disease following organ transplantation has occurred in Latin
America, where Chagas disease is endemic, but it has not yet been reported
in the United States.
A report in the latest Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5110a3.htm> describes three
cases in the United States of _T. cruzi_ infection associated with
transplantation of solid organs from the same donor. The Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention will collaborate with US transplant
organizations to discuss whether to screen potential donors for _T. cruzi_
infection and, if so, which donors to screen, how to screen, and what to do
if the screening tests are positive.

[Infection with _T. cruzi_ can be activated during immunosuppression in
organ recipients and can be transferred with the organ to the recipient.
The first situation is well known in countries where _T. cruzi_ is common,
especially after bone marrow transplantation. The second situation has been
described several times after renal transplants where the kidney came from
a _T. cruzi_ infected donor. The three cases in the US all refer to organs
from the same donor, and the comment on the CDC website emphasises that
organ transplants save life and that medical personnel should be aware that
Chagas disease is one of the possible risks associated with organ
transplantation. Â­ Mod.EP
