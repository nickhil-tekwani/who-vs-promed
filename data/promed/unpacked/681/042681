The Ministry of Health in the unity government confirmed the stable condition of people with meningitis in the Sabha Medical Center. The ministry's statement on Tuesday [22 Nov 2022] followed news circulating about an increase in meningitis cases in children at the Sabha Medical Center.

The Ministry confirmed the stable condition of the cases in the center, according to the reports received, stressing that the medical and paramedical staff should follow the instructions of the deputy prime minister and minister of health in charge, Ramadan Abu Jinnah, regarding following up the cases inside the center, to find out the exact type of disease causing it, and limit its spread.

The spokesperson for the Sabha Medical Center, Halima Al-Mahri, announced, on Monday [21 Nov 2022], the death of a child and cases in 23 others, suspected of having meningitis. Al-Mahri told Akhbar Libya 24, "Since the beginning of this November [2022], 23 children with gastroenteritis have been registered, and their ages range from one month to years." The spokesperson explained that one death of a child was recorded, and the number of cases is increasing, the latest of which was recorded today [21 Nov 2022], which increases the fear of the spread of meningitis among children, noting that all symptoms indicate meningitis. She added that the monitoring and rapid response teams at the National Center for Disease Control inside the medical center are working to follow up and identify the virus and confirm the type of disease.

Al-Mahri called on the parents to go to the nearby health facilities in the event of intestinal infections in children or suspected food poisoning.

[Sabha is an oasis city and capital of the Sabha District in southwestern Libya, about 640 kilometres (400 mi) south of Tripoli; Sabha Air Base, south of the city, is a Libyan Air Force installation (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabha,_Libya). A map showing the location of Sahba can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/SabhƒÅ,+Libya/.

The news report above apparently says that since the beginning of November 2022, 23 children with gastroenteritis have been hospitalized suspected of having meningitis, which has resulted in the death of one child. We are not given much more detail about a description of the patients (for example, age), the illness, epidemiologic links between patients, or laboratory findings.

Enteroviruses (EV) are the commonest cause of viral meningitis, especially in children under 5 years of age. The EV live in the human gastro-intestinal tract, where they may produce gastrointestinal symptoms. EV are shed in feces and are transmitted fecal-orally via contaminated hands and surfaces. Susceptible patients exposed to EV mostly will develop asymptomatic infection; only a few will develop meningitis.

However, gastrointestinal symptoms (such as nausea and vomiting) can accompany meningitis of any etiology (https://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/about/symptoms.html). Libya is outside the African meningococcal meningitis belt, but _Neisseria meningitidis_ is consistently reported to be one of the leading causes of bacterial meningitis in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region in which Libya lies (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971212001269).

More information from knowledgeable sources on this outbreak would be appreciated. - Mod.ML
