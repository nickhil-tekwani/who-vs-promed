Disease ravages famed 'unoy rice'
---------------------------------
A dreaded rice disease is ravaging the famed "unoy rice" in Kalinga,
an export rice variety that has established niche markets. Farmers in
Kalinga began selling the famed red rice in the USA and Europe in
1987.

Rice blast has reportedly destroyed 60 hectares [148 acres] there.
Government rice specialist Joe Casibang of the Office of the
Provincial Agriculturist (OPAG) said at least 75 metric tons worth PHP
3.7 million [about USD 88 000] has already been destroyed by the
fungus. When sold, the value of the destroyed "unoy" reached PHP 6
million [about USD 143 000].

Casibang said they are now studying ways on how to change to a
less-prone variety of "unoy" in Kalinga.

Each year, the disease is estimated to destroy enough rice to feed
more than 60 million people around the world.

[Rice blast is caused by the fungus _Magnaporthe oryzae_ (previously
classified as a strain of _M. grisea_). It is one of the most
destructive diseases of rice worldwide with potential yield losses of
more than 50 percent. Symptoms include lesions on all parts of the
shoot, as well as stem rot and panicle blight. When nodes are
infected, all plant parts above the infection die and yield losses are
severe. When infection occurs at the seedling or tillering stages,
plants are often completely killed. More than 50 species of grasses
and sedges can be affected by related pathogens, but most strains
isolated from rice can only infect a limited number of cultivars.

Symptom severity and spread of the blast fungus are influenced by
climatic conditions. The disease is also favoured by high nitrogen
levels (for example from fertilizers) and high humidity. The disease
is spread by infected plant debris, mechanical means (including insect
activity), water and wind. Disease management may include fungicides
and cultural practices, but relies mainly on resistant varieties.
However, the fungus is highly variable and this favours the emergence
of new strains with increased virulence.
