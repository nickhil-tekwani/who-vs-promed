Between 29 Aug-27 Nov [2015], 469 suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF), including 120 deaths, were reported in the 5 Darfur states, according to the Sudanese Ministry of Health.

The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Sudan reported in its latest weekly bulletin that the outbreak has now spread to 27 localities in Sudan's conflict-torn western region.

The highest number of reported cases is in West Darfur (296) followed by North Darfur (68) Central Darfur (68), South Darfur (23), and East Darfur (14).

The highest number of fatalities was recorded in West Darfur (90), followed by North Darfur (15), Central Darfur (12), East Darfur (2) and South Darfur (one).

Responses
------
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has supported vector control activities with larvicide interventions, reaching 6268 families (40 800 people) in Ed Daein, capital of East Darfur, in the South Darfur localities of Tullus, Kass, Ed El Fursan, Buram, and El Sereif Beni Hussein in North Darfur.

A further 30 000 families (195 000 people) in South Darfur's Tullus town and the Kass camps for the displaced were reached with integrated vector control activities conducted jointly by the Ministry of Health and the WHO. These activities are now ongoing in Buram, Ed Fursan and Nyala localities in the state. In addition, the WHO supported larvicide fogging and spraying assistance to more than 1300 families (8500 people) in El Sereif town, North Darfur.

In North Darfur, Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) Spain and the WHO support a treatment centre in El Sereif locality.

MSF Switzerland is supports a treatment centre and 2 mobile clinics in the West Darfur Krendig and Kereinik camps for the displaced in Kereinik locality.

The UN Children's Agency (Unicef) supported the Ministry of Health in West Darfur to reach 385 700 people on viral haemorrhagic fever prevention through local radio programmes. It supported national NGOs to conduct health education sessions in El Geneina and Kereinik localities.

Unicef has also supported health promotion activities in Zalingei, Azum, Bindisi, West Jebel Marra and Wadi Salih localities of Central Darfur.

Haemorrhagic fevers are endemic in many states of Sudan including Red Sea, Kassala, Gedaref, and South Kordofan, OCHA states. In 2012, sporadic cases of dengue fever and yellow fever co-infection were reported in Darfur, while no cases were reported in 2013. In 2014, however, a large-scale dengue fever outbreak occurred in Red Sea (1092 cases), North Darfur (132), South Darfur (48), West Darfur (24), South Kordofan (59), and Kassala (57).

[Cases of hemorrhagic disease are occurring over an increasing geographic area, with all 5 Darfur states now involved. The situation in Darfur continues to be confusing and is without an identified etiological agent. There is little doubt that there is an outbreak of hemorrhagic disease. However, attributing these cases to West Nile (WN) virus infection -- as was done in a previous ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20151102.3760440) -- raises significant questions, because WN fever is not a hemorrhagic disease, and the number of deaths in such a short period of time is not compatible with West Nile virus outbreaks. However, the above report does not mention West Nile virus infections. A dengue outbreak was mentioned in a recent Ministry of Health report (see ProMED-mail archive no 20151124.3816818).

Mod.ML commented concerning previous cases, "Hemorrhagic fever can be caused by a variety of viruses that have been known to occur in Sudan. Viral hemorrhagic fever [VHF] can be caused by 4 distinct viral families: arenaviruses (Lassa fever virus), filoviruses (Ebola virus and Marburg virus), bunyaviruses (hantaviruses that cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome [HFRS], Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever [CCHF] virus, Rift Valley fever virus), and flaviviruses (dengue, yellow fever). Most VHFs are zoonoses and the viruses are usually geographically restricted to the areas where their host species live. Certain bacterial infections can also cause hemorrhagic fever, such as scrub typhus, leptospirosis, and plague."

Dr. Fons Van Gompel, an internist and tropical Medicine specialist of the Medical Services & Travel Clinic Institute for Tropical Medicine
Antwerp, Belgium, commented that the possibility of relapsing fever caused by _Borrelia recurrentis_ should be considered in this undiagnosed outbreak (see ProMED-mail archive no. 20151108.3775050).

A definitive diagnosis of these cases is needed urgently, as fatalities continue. The fogging for vector control indicates that the health authorities in Darfur believe that the pathogen is arthropod-borne, probably by mosquitoes. However, until a reliable diagnosis is established, prevention and appropriate treatment of cases will not be possible. One hopes that the WHO team currently operating in the area will help to determine the situation on the ground and to get appropriate samples to reference laboratories, including those outside the country such as the Pasteur Institute laboratory in Senegal. ProMED would appreciate receiving additional information about the outbreak, including laboratory results, as it becomes available.
