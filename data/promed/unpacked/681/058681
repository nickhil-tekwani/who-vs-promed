1000 Geese Die Near Roswell, New Mexico
A pesticide is suspected of killing 800 to 1200 geese east of Roswell, New
Mexico, and near the Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge, a state
official said Wednesday.
Preliminary examinations of the birds, mostly snow geese, found no signs of
disease, said Bill Hays, field supervisor for the state Department of Game
and Fish Roswell district.
"We suspected at first we had avian cholera," said Ben Hanson, a wildlife
information specialist with the agency in Roswell. But preliminary results
from an Albuquerque laboratory turned up no sign of the disease. The
department is awaiting toxicology results from a Missouri lab, which could
take up to 2 weeks, Hanson said.
"What we're trying to do now is determine what killed them if it wasn't
that disease," he said. Conservation officers first learned of the dying
birds Sunday afternoon, Hays said.
Dead geese should be allowed to decay naturally and should not be salvaged
or eaten, and pets should be kept away from the dead geese, he said.
Hanson said, however, if a dead goose is causing a problem by being too
close to a dwelling, people can call the Bitter Lake refuge or the
Department's Roswell office, he said.
