from some countries may include exceptional imported cases or exclude
exported cases which were found positive in the countries of destination.
During 2003, decreased incidence of recorded BSE cases, compared to 2002,
was seen in most countries. The exceptions were Portugal, Spain, Japan,
Poland, and the Czech Republic. This tendency seems to continue, during the
first 5 months of 2004, in the Czech Republic (4 cases, compared to 4
throughout 2003) and Poland (7 cases, compared to 5 throughout 2003).

Mad cow hammering farm incomes: StatsCan
-----------------------------------------
Twice as many cattle-producing families live on less than CAD 20 000 [USD
14 671] a year as a result of the mad cow crisis, says Statistics Canada.
The new figures, released today, also show the U.S. border closure in May
2003 has sliced the income of all ranchers by an average of 1/3.
Total losses to the industry since one cow with bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE, was discovered in Alberta during 2003 have been
estimated at nearly $3 billion [USD 2.2 billion], but that sheds little
light on how the crisis has affected people, said Verna Mitura of
Statistics Canada.
"What we wanted to try to do was take this $3-billion number and say, 'How
does that relate when you're talking about individual farm families?' " she
said from Ottawa.
The losses vary according to the size of the farm. Canada's 2200 largest
cattle farms, which have more than $500 000 [USD 366 784] in receipts, lost
an average of $220 000 [USD 161 385] each due to the crisis.
A more typical cattle farm, with about 150 animals and at least $100 000
[USD 73 356] in farm income, lost about $20 000 [USD 14 671]. That cut
income from about $60 000 [USD 44 014] -- which is Canada's average family
income -- down to about $40,000 [USD 29 342].
On the low end, nearly twice as many cattle farm families are now living on
less than $20 000 [USD 14 671] a year.
In 2002, there were 6800 families in that category -- about 14 percent of
the total. After a year of BSE, that total had risen to an estimated 13 400
-- about 27 percent of cattle farm families.
Fewer than 7 percent of families in the general Canadian population live on
that low an income, says Statistics Canada. The study only included
unincorporated farms.
Mad cow disease stopped the flow of Canadian beef to the United States
almost immediately after a northern Alberta cow was found to be sick in May
2003. The border has since reopened to most cuts of processed beef but
remains closed to shipments of live cattle.
Speaking in Kamloops, B.C., federal Agriculture Minister Bob Speller
suggested the border could fully reopen by 1 Sep 2004.
"We are getting assurances from the United States that they are well
underway in their process," he said. "It should be resolved by Sept 1st."

USDA steps up mad-cow testing -- slowly
---------------------------------------
Early screening of high-risk cattle for mad cow disease has found no
suspected cases in the 2871 tests performed in the expanded program's first
2 weeks.
But the U.S. Department of Agriculture's USD 70 million testing program has
been slow to gear up to the point where it can screen 220 000 animals for
bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the next 12 to 18 months.
The program, which started 1 Jun 2004, is meant to reassure domestic and
international consumers that U.S. beef is safe to eat.
People can get a variation of the brain-wasting Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
by eating infected beef.
Most of the agency's 12 mad cow testing laboratories nationwide, including
the one at Kansas State University, still aren't operating. States such as
Kansas have been bogged down in contract negotiations with rendering plants
in the effort to get brain samples for testing.
"Technically, it started 1 Jun 2004, but we haven't received the OK from
the USDA for our specific program and how we are going to run it," said
Kansas Animal Health Commissioner George Teagarden. "Until that gets
approved, we are in a slowdown mode."
But USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said that the
infrastructure for the expanded testing program was in place 1 Jun 2004 and
that the agency is just now ironing out details.
"On the first day, it wasn't expected we would be performing at maximum
output," said spokesman Jim Rogers.
Kansas -- the nation's 2nd-largest beef producer -- during 2003 tested 150
animals for BSE. It is supposed to test 7000 animals under the expanded
program, but the final figure is likely to be closer to 5000 because
livestock in the state's northern counties will go to Nebraska for testing,
Teagarden said.
"There is no question in my mind we are doing as much as we can right now
-- and we will be doing more," Teagarden said.
Kevin Varner, the Health Inspection Service veterinarian in charge of the
Kansas BSE-testing program, said 47 Kansas animals have been tested (most
of them out of state) since the expanded program began.
Kansas and Nebraska, among other states, are having contract troubles with
rendering companies, he said. To get the brain samples it needs to test,
the Health Inspection Service reimburses the companies for holding and
identifying carcasses.
"They want more than we want to pay," Varner said. "We have taxpayer
dollars we have to watch."
Most of the regional testing laboratories approved to date are still not
operating. A few have had equipment and contracting issues. All are
expected to be on line within weeks, Rogers said.
The agency's own testing laboratory in Iowa is running, Rogers said, as are
the new regional laboratories in Georgia, Washington, California, Colorado
and Texas.
Kansas State University has one of the 5 laboratories approved 11 May 2004
by the Health Inspection Service. 7 other labs were approved in March.
George Kennedy, director of the Kansas State's veterinary diagnostic
laboratory, said it will be July before its BSE lab is running.
After some initial juggling to find a room, the university is now working
to get the physical laboratory prepared -- trying to get tables and
electrical outlets for the computers, for example. Next week they plan to
start training staff.
Meanwhile, the nation's meat industry is nervously watching USDA's initial
BSE testing results, which are posted on its Health Inspection Service Web
site.
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/lpa/issues/bse-enhan_surv/bse_test_results.html>
The department created an uproar in the cattle industry when it disclosed
it planned to make public all the preliminary test results -- including any
BSE-positive results from the less accurate rapid tests -- before
conducting more extensive and time-consuming tests on suspect samples.
"It is somewhat dangerous to do that, but it is also dangerous to keep that
quiet," Teagarden said. "We know things leak out. I think an official
announcement is better than a rumor. With this enhanced program there will
be rumors if we are not very open."
The Health Inspection Service during 2003 tested 20 543 animals, most of
them downer cattle that could not stand or walk.
After the nation's first mad cow case in December 2003, the agency doubled
the number to 40 000. It later expanded the number to 220 000 high-risk
animals in a move to reassure foreign governments. [For comparative testing
figures of risk animals in the EU, see further in item 4. - Mod.AS]
Some 35 million cattle are slaughtered each year in the United States.

*Ratio: positive cases per 10 000 risk animals tested

[These are interesting figures. The 3 countries with the highest ratio of
BSE-positive risk animals per 10 000 animals tested are Portugal (23.11),
UK (18.40), and Ireland (12.81). In all 14 BSE-affected states except
Portugal, the ratio decreased during 2003 compared to 2002.
Greece has a very low testing rate. Being one of the 3 countries which have
so far recorded only one BSE case (all 3 in 2001), out of the 14 affected
states (Sweden is still BSE-free), it is interesting to compare Greece to
the other 2 countries in this exclusive group, Austria and Finland. The
testing rate in risk animals (percentage of adult animals in national herd)
during 2003 was: Finland, 5.86 (the highest of all 15 states); Austria,
1.75; Greece, 0.62 (the lowest of all 15 states). It seems that Greece's
claim to the absence of BSE cases since 2001 will be fortified by enhanced
testing efforts, especially in risk animals. The same observation might be
valid in respect to Greece's testing of healthy animals: during 2003, the
mean percentage of tested healthy animals in the 14 BSE-affected EU states
was 22.4, while Greece tested only 7.5 percent of its adult cattle. These
and other interesting data can be seen in the full report. - Mod.AS]
