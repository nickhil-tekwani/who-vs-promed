As the total of people infected in the largest _E. coli_ outbreak in state
history reached 155, New York Health Department officials warned day care
centers and school districts to be on the alert for signs of sick children
and infections spread from one person to another.
3-year-old Clifton Park girl died and dozens more became ill from the
bacteria after attending the Washington County Fair in Greenwich during its
final weekend on Aug. 28 and 29.
"The outbreak has peaked," said Joel Ackelsberg, a medical epidemiologist
at the Bureau of Communicable Diseases. "If people were going to get it,
they probably would have already gotten it if they had been at the fair."
Forty-five people remained hospitalized Monday evening across the region,
including a 4-year-old Saratoga County boy in serious condition at Albany
Medical Center Hospital.
State Health Department officials believe water contaminated with manure
from the dairy barns on the site is the likely cause of the outbreak. Tests
are still being run to isolate the particular strain of _E. coli_ believed
to be the problem.
So far, health officials have not been able to find a pattern among those
who became ill.
Health Department spokeswoman Kristine Smith said E. coli-infected water
could have been used to make ice, drinks, wash lettuce, and prepare foods.
"It's by doing that painstaking detail work that we'll be able to determine
what exposures are responsible," Ackelsberg said.
While he said about 40 percent of those infected drank some tap water at
the fair, he said those findings are still preliminary.
The Health Department has assigned dozens of people to investigate the
outbreak, one of the worst in the country. The largest-ever outbreak of _E.
coli_ was in 1993, when at least 500 people reported becoming ill after
eating undercooked Jack-in-the-Box hamburgers in Washington state. Three
children died in that outbreak.
"The greatest risk people have now is getting the illness from another
person," Ackelsberg said.
To minimize that risk, health officials were planning to send a letter to
all school districts and day care centers in the Capital Region to ask them
to be on the watch for kids with diarrhea and to be especially careful
about hand washing.
Studies have shown that about 15 percent of all cases associated with an
_E. coli_ outbreak are the result of secondary transmissions from person to
person, Ackelsberg said. Those at greatest risk for spreading the bacteria
are people who work in child care, health care or food service.
State Health Department officials said fair organizers met all state
requirements when they tested the water at the site in June. The specific
well believed to be responsible for the contamination had even been
upgraded several years ago to minimize the risk of contamination from
fertilizers and cow manure, Smith said.
But she said the drought taxed even the newer system. As the water table
dropped, the pipe was unable to reach into the depths of the aquifer, where
the purest water is found.
Complicating the situation was a downpour on Thursday Aug. 26, which
produced runoff from the fair's dairy barns, housing hundreds of cattle.
That runoff seeped into the same aquifer tapped by water supply pipes at
the fairground.
Smith said other rural residents, especially farmers with dairy cattle,
might want to test their wells for possible contamination.
