Rinderpest in Kenya
-------------------
(last previously reported outbreak: December 1996)
This emergency report is based on information reported on 13 Dec 2001 by Dr
William K Toroitich Chong, director of Veterinary Services, Ministry of
Agriculture, Livestock Development and Marketing, Nairobi:
Nature of diagnosis: suspicion and laboratory.
Date of initial detection of animal health incident: 23 Oct 2001.
Estimated date of first infection: Aug 2001.
One outbreak of rinderpest in African buffaloes (_Syncerus caffer_) in Meru
North district, Eastern province (in central Kenya)
Total number of animals in the outbreak:
Species/susceptible/cases/deaths/destroyed/slaughtered
Fau/...../2/0/0/0
Infection with rinderpest virus lineage II was diagnosed at the Muguga
Regional Laboratory and the Institute of Animal Health, Pirbright, United
Kingdom, using virus neutralization, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and
reverse transcriptase PCR.
The source of agent and origin of infection are under investigation as is
the mode of spread. No disease in livestock. Active disease surveillance is
to be followed by cattle vaccination if need be.
The OIE Central Bureau notes that this outbreak occurred within the zone
that Kenya's delegate to the OIE declared provisionally free from
rinderpest as from Jan 1999.

[The reappearance of rinderpest virus activity in Kenya is a cause for
great concern. At the 68th general session of the OIE in May 2001, the
international committee adopted a resolution designating a list of 88
Member Countries that were considered free from rinderpest infection. It
was further decided that the delegates of member countries, whose countries
or zones within their national territories are recognised as rinderpest
free, should reconfirm by letter in November of each year both their status
and that the criteria by which their status was recognized remained the
same. It was understood that they would immediately notify the central
bureau of the OIE if rinderpest infection should occur in these countries
or zones. As prescribed in appendix 3.8.1 to the international animal
health code of the OIE, the conditions for a country that has had clinical
cases of rinderpest within the last 10 years to be declared free from the
disease by the OIE include the performance of serosurveillance in cattle
and other susceptible domestic animals. Investigations into infection in
susceptible wild species must be carried out where these species occur in
significant numbers. Sampling should be done when possible. Additional
strategic sampling of domestic stock should be done in areas adjacent to
large game populations to enhance the possibilities of detecting the
presence of virus in game. The findings must be consistent with freedom
from infection.
In order to enable rinderpest eradication on a regional basis and to
prevent a renewal of the epizootic, as carried out with the help of
international organizations in the past, it would be valuable to obtain the
results of similar investigations in adjacent regions of eastern Africa.
