A new strain of bacterial potato wilt has reduced interstate markets
for some Far North Queensland growers.

The disease, which has been found in small patches at Tolga and on
parts of the Atherton Tablelands, will prevent growers within a 20
kilometre (12.5 mi) radius of the infection from exporting to
Tasmania, South, and Western Australia, and parts of Victoria and New
South Wales.

A potato grower says the quarantines mean more growers are sending
produce to Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne. "So all of their potatoes
now will have to come back onto the Eastern seaboard market, which of
course overloads that market, and it's reflected in prices and
availability," he says.

[Brown rot (also called bacterial wilt) of potato is caused by
_Ralstonia solanacearum_ race 3 (biovar 2, adapted to cooler
temperatures) and is widely distributed in warmer temperate areas.
Symptoms include internal staining and rotting of tubers, wilting and
death of plants and may result in substantial yield losses of up to
75 percent. However, there may also be latent infections. The
pathogen can survive in potato tubers during storage posing a high
risk for introduction of the pathogen to new areas. Tomato and other
solanaceous crops are also susceptible.

The bacterium is spread by mechanical means (including insects),
contaminated equipment, infected plant material (including seed
potatoes), soil, and water. Some weeds and unharvested potato plants
may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Disease management is difficult
relying mostly on exclusion from new areas. Some cultural methods and
limited genetic resistance may be used.

In Australia, potato brown rot is thought to have been introduced
possibly on more than one occasion through seed potatoes. It has been
previously recorded in all states except Tasmania and Western
Australia, with the Eastern seaboard states (Queensland, New South
Wales, Victoria) generally more seriously affected. The origin of the
new strain reported above is not mentioned, but it may have arisen
locally.

_R. solanacearum_ has been classified into various races and biovars
affecting more than 200 plant species including major crops.
