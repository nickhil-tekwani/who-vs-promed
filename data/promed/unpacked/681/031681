Avian influenza in Romania
--------------------------
Follow-up report No. 1
Information received on (and up to) 13 Oct 2005 from Dr
Gabriel Predoi, director general, National Sanitary
Veterinary and Food Safety Authority (NSVFSA), Bucharest:
Precise identification of agent: influenza virus type A,
subtype H5.
Date of first confirmation of the event: 7 Oct 2005.
Date of start of the event: 4 Oct 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, postmortem and laboratory.
On 7 Oct 2005, at 1445 hours, the Romanian Central
Veterinary Authority set up a 3 km radius protection zone
and a 10 km radius surveillance zone, and established the
number of backyard premises and the number of domestic
poultry and other susceptible species in each zone.
On 13 Oct 2005, at 0030 hours, the NSVFSA was informed by
the Institute for Diagnostics and Animal Health
(notification No. 11787-11809/ 13.10.2005) of the isolation
of an avian influenza virus, type H5.
The virus was isolated from samples taken from 2 hens and a
duck in the backyard premises of 2 inhabitants of
Ceamurlia-de-Jos locality, close to Golovita Lake in Tulcea
County.
During the morning of 13 Oct, the NSVFSA decided to send the
isolated virus to VLA Weybridge, United Kingdom (European
Union and OIE Reference Laboratory for avian influenza).
Up to the morning of 13 Oct, a total of 4797 birds (4009
hens, 318 ducks, 238 geese and 232 turkey hens) from 72
backyard premises (out of a total of 420 backyard premises
existing in Ceamurlia-de-Jos) had been killed and their
cadavers destroyed by incineration. Culling and incineration
procedures for domestic poultry are still in progress and
will be completed as soon as possible.

[This report does not identify a neuramidase feature of the
virus. However, test results from the outbreak in Turkey,
which occurred at the same time, have identified the causal
virus as an H5N1 quite similar in its genetic makeup to the
virus isolated at Novosibirsk in Russia. Surveillance for
local waterfowl is critical at this point to help determine
the origin, particularly if this turns out to a similar H5N1
virus to ones identified in Russia and Turkey. - Mod.PC]
