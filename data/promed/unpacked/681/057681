A chilling disease known to have devastated amphibian populations and
ravaged ecosystems overseas was confirmed in 4 wild American
bullfrogs in Japan, researchers said Monday [10 Jun 2007].
It was the first time chytridiomycosis was found in Japan's natural
environment, the researchers said. Chytridiomycosis will not affect
humans, but it can quickly wipe out nearly entire populations of some
amphibian species. That, in turn, could reduce the number of snakes
and birds that prey on the amphibians, throwing entire ecosystems out
of sync.
The Environment Ministry said it would start a nationwide survey on
the disease in the summer [2007].
The disease was 1st confirmed in imported pet frogs in Tokyo in
December last year [2006]. Experts at that time warned that if the
disease were to spread in the wild, it might be nearly impossible to
contain.
A group of researchers, including Yumi Une, an associate professor at
Azabu University's School of Veterinary Medicine, has been studying
infections among frogs traded in the country as well as those caught
in the wild. For its preliminary survey, the group studied 132 newts
[aquatic salamanders], Japanese tree frogs, and other species traded
or caught in Japan's natural environment.
A total of 42 were found to have been infected with chytridiomycosis;
38 of them had been kept by humans, but the remaining 4 were wild
American bullfrogs that never went through human hands, according to
the researchers.
The American bullfrog is not a native species, but it has long been
living in the natural environment in Japan.
Studies overseas showed that chytridiomycosis, which stems from the
chytrid fungus, will not kill American bullfrogs, meaning that
infected frogs have a longer period to spread the infectious disease.
"We cannot accurately say how far the disease has spread because this
is only a preliminary survey," Une said. "But we must come up with
countermeasures as soon as possible to prevent the disease from
spreading among frogs that are native to the country."
The disease caused a drastic decline in Australia's frog population
in the 1990s, and has since been confirmed in areas of the United
States, Central and South America, Africa, and Europe. In Panama, 48
amphibian species were infected, and their numbers plunged by about
90 percent.
[The amphibian chytrid fungus (_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_)]
lives on the skin of frogs, making it difficult for them to breathe
through their skin or adjust their body temperatures. If frogs are
infected with the disease, the following symptoms appear:
- the movement in their legs, especially the hind ones, is anemic;
- species that are nocturnal or live in trees sit out in the open
throughout the day;
- they show little movement or do not react at all if touched by humans;
- they do not blink if touched by humans;
- If they are turned over, they cannot return to their original positions; and
- they do not react if their mouths are touched or grabbed by humans.

[Chytridiomycosis is a key example of an emerging infectious disease
in wildlife. The most important factor driving the emergence of such
wildlife diseases is the anthropogenic (human-borne) introduction of
pathogens into new geographic areas (pathogen pollution). Following
its introduction, confining the disease indoors is a complex, or
almost unattainable goal.
