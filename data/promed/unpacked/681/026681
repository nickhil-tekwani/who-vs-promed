Three people became sick recently after eating raw oysters collected from the same private grounds off Fisherman Island on Virginia's Eastern Shore. They ate the oysters at restaurants in Massachusetts and Maryland, victims of a pathogen that grows naturally in warm waters, known as _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_.

It typically hits unlucky consumers with vomiting, diarrhea and other stomach ailments. In one of the 3 reported cases, the person was ill for 10 days, said Keith Skiles, an oyster sanitation specialist with the Virginia Department of Health. Skiles said Virginia has never experienced "an outbreak" of this kind before, defined by national rules as more than 2 cases of the infection stemming from the same waters. "We hope it never gets us again," Skiles said on Mon 15 Jul 2013, 3 days after the health department announced it was closing down the Fisherman Island waters for the next year. A news release issued did not mention the word "outbreak," saying instead the closure was part of an "emergency."

The incident opens the door to renewed debate about allowing oysters to be harvested in warm summer months. On public grounds, oystering is limited to the fall and winter, when _Vibrio_ and other potentially dangerous pathogens are not active. But the state grants oyster farmers the right to harvest from their private beds any time they want to, as long as they take precautions against contaminants that might be present. Farmers, for example, can ice down their catches immediately or work only in the cooler, morning hours before a 10 am curfew, according to state regulations.

Skiles said the tainted oysters were gathered from private grounds around Fisherman Island in mid-May 2013, not far from where the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel empties onto Northampton County. They appear to have been collected in compliance with state regulations, he said, and were eaten several weeks ago in mid- or late-June 2013 after being shipped north.

The word "outbreak" is one that states and seafood merchants work overtime to avoid, knowing how it quickly can sink reputations and kill consumer demand.

The Virginia Marine Products Board, which markets state seafood, said it was unaware as of 16 Jul 2013 of the Fisherman Island outbreak but would seek information right away. It said it had not received any calls from other businesses in other states. Several seafood buyers contacted said they, too, had not heard of the incident but expressed concern that word would spread quickly.

The closed waters around Fisherman Island affect only oysters and clams, not fish. It is possible the area could be reopened sooner than a year, Skiles said, depending on what water quality samples showed.

[It is important to stress that _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ is naturally present in marine waters and does not imply sewage contamination, as would be the case with _Salmonella_ sp. or _E. coli_. It is most common in warmer waters such as those of the American Gulf Coast, but warmer waters in more northern climates such as Virginia can also be associated with oyster-associated _V. parahaemolyticus_.

In 2005, a New England Journal of Medicine report highlighted this infection linked to even Alaskan oysters:
McLaughlin JB, DePaola A, Bopp CA, et al: Outbreak of _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_ Gastroenteritis Associated with Alaskan Oysters. N Engl J Med 2005; 353(14): 1463-70 (full article available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa051594).

"Abstract
---------
Background: _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_, the leading cause of seafood-associated gastroenteritis in the USA, typically is associated with the consumption of raw oysters gathered from warm water estuaries. We describe a recognized outbreak of _V. parahaemolyticus_ infection associated with the consumption of seafood from Alaska.

Methods: After we received reports of the occurrence of gastroenteritis on a cruise ship, we conducted a retrospective cohort study among passengers, as well as active surveillance throughout Alaska to identify additional cases, and an environmental study to identify sources of _V. parahaemolyticus_ and contributors to the outbreak.

Results: Of 189 passengers, 132 (70 percent) were interviewed; 22 of the interviewees (17 percent) met our case definition of gastroenteritis. In our multiple logistic-regression analysis, consumption of raw oysters was the only significant predictor of illness; the attack rate among people who consumed oysters was 29 percent. Active surveillance identified a total of 62 patients with gastroenteritis. _V. parahaemolyticus_ serotype O6:K18 was isolated from the majority of patients tested and from environmental samples of oysters. Patterns on pulsed-field gel electrophoresis were highly related across clinical and oyster isolates. All oysters associated with the outbreak were harvested when mean daily water temperatures exceeded 15.0 deg C (59 deg F) (the theorized threshold for the risk of _V. parahaemolyticus_ illness from the consumption of raw oysters). Since 1997, mean water temperatures in July and August at the implicated oyster farm increased 0.21 deg C per year (P less than 0.001 by linear regression); 2004 was the only year during which mean daily temperatures in July and August 2004 at the shellfish farm did not drop below 15.0 deg C (59 deg F).

Conclusions: This investigation extends by 1000 km (621 mi) the northernmost documented source of oysters that caused illness due to _V. parahaemolyticus_. Rising temperatures of ocean water seem to have contributed to one of the largest known outbreaks of _V. parahaemolyticus_ in the USA." - Mod.LL
