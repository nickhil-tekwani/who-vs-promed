As of 27 Feb 2007 at 12 PM EST, 370 persons infected with the outbreak
strain of _Salmonella_ Tennessee have been reported to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 42 states. Among 294 patients for
whom clinical information is available, 60 (20 per cent) were hospitalized.
No deaths have been attributed to this infection. Onset dates, which are
known for 256 patients, ranged from 1 Aug 2006 to 16 Feb 2007, and 62 per
cent of these illnesses began after 1 Dec 2006.
PulseNet (the national subtyping network for foodborne disease surveillance
coordinated by CDC) detected a slowly rising increase in cases of
_Salmonella_ Tennessee this fall. OutbreakNet (the national network of
public health officials coordinated by CDC that investigates enteric
disease outbreaks) then worked for several weeks to identify this unusual
food vehicle.
Public health officials from several states have isolated salmonella from
open jars of peanut butter of both Peter Pan and Great Value brands. For 9
jars, the serotype has been confirmed as Tennessee and DNA fingerprinting
has shown that the pattern is the outbreak strain.
FDA officials and the peanut butter manufacturer are working
collaboratively to learn more about production of peanut butter to
determine how it may have become contaminated.
The states that have reported cases are Alaska (1 case), Alabama (10),
Arkansas (3), Arizona (5), California (4), Colorado (11), Connecticut (2),
Florida (4), Georgia (18), Iowa (7), Illinois (9), Indiana (15), Kansas
(9), Kentucky (10), Massachusetts (6), Maryland (2), Maine (1), Michigan
(9), Minnesota (5), Missouri (17), Mississippi (5), Montana (2), Nebraska
(2), Nevada (1), New Jersey (6), New Mexico (1), New York (41), North
Carolina (22), North Dakota (1), Ohio (9), Oklahoma (11), Oregon (2),
Pennsylvania (27), South Carolina (8), South Dakota (6), Tennessee (18),
Texas (16), Virginia (23), Vermont (7), Washington (4), Wisconsin (6), and
West Virginia (4).

[Since 21 Feb 2007, a further 41 cases have been attributed to the outbreak
strain with 9 more hospital admissions and 1 new state (North Dakota).
Neither of the 2 deaths mentioned in ProMED-mail posting 20070222.0660 have
