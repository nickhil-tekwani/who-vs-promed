Rural anthrax, Argentina, 2012
------------------------------
Summary:
This kind of report has been submitted to public opinion since 2004 with the purpose of clearly defining the endemic features of rural carbuncle [anthrax] in Argentina. Its assessment area is now 35 years old, and it comprises 30 districts of the province of Buenos Aires, where there was an annual percentile diagnostic rate of 11 percent during 1977-2012 with maximum 5-year variations ranging from an 18 percent diagnostic rate in 1977-1981 to a minimum of 5 percent in 2007-2011.

Seasonal percentile distribution has proven that 18 percent in summer and 11 percent in autumn are hot seasons, when bovine anthrax turns out to be most common. There is an 8 percent suddenly dead animal rate during winter-spring caused by _Bacillus anthracis_. Over the 35 years, 436 bacteria strains were isolated, an average of 12 annual isolations. Therefore, this is why 49 percent of rural districts have suffered bovine anthrax outbreaks.

The Alert and Response Zone (ARZ) before a natural, accidental or deliberate event involving _B. anthracis_ in the district of Azul logged 66 focal points of bovine anthrax outbreaks by GIS -- the Geographic Information System -- for 1988-2012. In 2012, 134 suspect bone samples were submitted with 8 positives (6 percent), essentially the same rate (5 percent) as for 2007-2011. The 2012 outbreaks were in Alvear, B. Juarez, Dolores, Guamini, Loberia, and Olavaria, with minimal outbreaks during the winter (0 percent) and spring (one percent diagnostic rate) periods, compared to the summer (13 percent) and autumn (7 percent).

In order to monitor and compare different regions, several veterinary diagnostic laboratories (5) were invited to participate, and they proved to have a 13 percent annual percentile distribution in 2012: i.e. Laboratorio Bahia Blanca, Pcia de Bs.As, 0+/29 samples; Laboratorio Regional Rauch, Min Ag., Pcia de Bs.As., 8+/16 with cases in Ayacucho and Rauch; INTA Balcarce, Pcia de Bs.As., 1+/4, General Pueyrredon; Laboratorio Biologico Tandil, Pcia de Bs.As., 1+/4, Tandil; and Laboratorio Santa Rosa, Pcia La Pampa, 3+/46, Realico and Ultracan.

There were 10 cases of human cutaneous anthrax in 6 provinces: Buenos Aires (General Lavalle, Olavarria), Corrientes (Curuzu Cuatia), Mendoza (San Rafael), Santa Fe (Las Colonias, Rosario), Tierra del Fuego (Rio Grande). The human cases outside the provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa indicate a wider unobserved livestock-outbreak situation.

In 2012, there was a meager 14 percent vaccination rate against anthrax, matching a national vaccine annual production of just a few more than 15 million doses, and down 3 million doses from 2011. Though the ARZ diagnostic rate is now 1/3rd of what it was in the early years, the epidemiological situation for rural anthrax in Argentina hasn't significantly changed during 1977-2012; consequently, the national endemic feature can only be characterized by human negligence [not vaccinating livestock].

[Our thanks to Ramon for this annual report for 2012. If there are any errors, they are mine in constructing this summary from his full report. He tells me that he and his wife are on their annual vacation until the 8 May 2013, so any queries will have to await his return, as Paula is not allowing him to take his laptop with him. I am presuming that when he returns, his report will soon be up on the Azul Laboratory website.

Otherwise, the outbreaks in Laprida (5) and Olavarria (3) are now quiet, with the last outbreak noted on 15 Mar 2013. All the veterinarians in the area have been commenting on the elevated numbers of tabanid flies [large biting flies which spread anthrax] this anthrax season.
