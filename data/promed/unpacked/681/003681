So far 75 people have been affected (primary cases): 67 in England, 3 in Wales and 5 in Scotland [by _E. coli_]. Genetic analysis has shown that all these individuals have all been infected with the same strain. Most of these cases are adults but the total number of cases has an age range of between 2 to 90. 27 males and 48 (64 percent) females have been affected. In addition, there have also been 10 secondary cases reported. These are people who have become unwell through contact with a primary case.

Further details are available on 82 of the total cases all of whom reported symptoms of diarrhea. Bloody diarrhea was reported by 58 people (71 percent) and 25 people have been hospitalized as a result of their illness. There have been no deaths or cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome which is a serious complication of an _E. coli_ infection which can result in kidney failure.

PHE is working with Public Health Wales, Health Protection Scotland, Animal and Plant Health Agency and the Food Standards Agency to gather, share and analyse information. At present there is no clear indication as to what is causing the outbreak.

Dr Bob Adak, head of the gastrointestinal diseases department at PHE, said: "Any infection with _E. coli_ can be very serious. We have carried out initial investigations which involved interviewing some of the affected people to look for connections that link individuals in terms of the foods that they had eaten and the places they had visited in the days before they became ill. This information is now being used to develop more in-depth investigations designed to identify the cause of the outbreak."

[The posting does not specifically state that the pathogen is _E. coli_ O157 or any other enterohemorrhagic strain, but the context of the article strongly suggests it. It is unusual that most of the cases were in adults, but that observation could reflect the cohort of individuals that would eat the vehicle. - Mod.LL
