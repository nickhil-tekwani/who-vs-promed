The Malaysian Quarantine and Inspection Services (MAQIS) has just found dangerous worms in the samples brought in from China through the North Butterworth Container Terminal (NBCT) in Penang on [14 May 2018], reported The Malay Mail.

These worms are hazardous to our health because it could cause an anisakiasis disease outbreak in Malaysia.

According to MAQIS director-general Datuk Mokhtarud-din Husain, they found the worms through a physical examination and sampling conducted on several sardine cans which arrived in 2 containers. The 2 containers have an estimated weight of 36 720 kg and is valued at approximately RM200 000 [approx. 50 000 USD]. The containers have been held back.

Mokhtard-din explained that these worms originate from the genus _Anisakis_ spp, which causes the anisakiasis disease, a parasitic and zoonotic disease carried by fish. Therefore, if we were to consume food like raw fish or half-cooked fish which are infected with _Anisakis_ spp parasites, we are at risk to contract the anisakiasis disease.

Mokhtarud-din added that this case is being investigated for further action.

[_Anisakis_ is a nematode found in many fish species worldwide including temperate and arctic regions. The nematodes live in the tissue between the intestine of the fish, and when the fish is caught (and dies) the nematode migrates to the muscles. This is why fish should be cleaned of intestinal contents as soon as possible after being caught.

Once in the human intestine, the larvae invade the mucosa but do not cause a systemic invasion. This creates an eosinophilic inflammation in the small intestine with a pain.

It is very doubtful that _Anisakis_ can survive in canned food. If they do it means that the food is not sterile which also opens up for other infections including botulism. - Mod.EP
