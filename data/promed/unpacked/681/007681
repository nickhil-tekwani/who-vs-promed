Cambodian girl dies from bird flu: WHO
--------------------------------------
A 5-year-old Cambodian girl has died from bird flu [avian influenza
A/(H5N1) virus infection], the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on
Wed 9 Feb 2011, in the 1st reported fatality from the virus since
early last year [2010].

The girl fell ill in the capital Phnom Penh on 30 Jan 2011 and was
taken to hospital with symptoms of coughing and shortness of breath, a
joint statement from Cambodia and the UN's public health arm [WHO]
said. She died on 4 Feb 2011. "Despite intensive medical care, the
girl died 12 hours after admission from complications," it said. The
child is the 11th person in the country to become infected with the
H5N1 virus and the 9th to die since 2003.

Cambodia said it was working to identify her close contacts and "to
initiate preventive treatment as required". Health minister Mam Bun
Heng urged people with respiratory infections who had been in "contact
with dead or sick poultry to promptly seek medical attention."

According to the statement, the H5N1 avian influenza strain has
killed more than 300 people worldwide since 2003.
