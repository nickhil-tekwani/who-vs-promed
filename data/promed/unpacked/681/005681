On 17 Jun 2005, the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in
Ames, Iowa, confirmed the finding of vesicular stomatitis in a horse at a
premises in Garfield County, Utah, near the town of Boulder. This is the
1st confirmed case of vesicular stomatitis in the state of Utah in 2005.
Utah had no cases of vesicular stomatitis in 2004.
The complement fixation (CF) test results showed that the sick horse had a
4-fold increase in antibodies to vesicular stomatitis New Jersey virus in
paired sera collected on 6 and 15 Jun 2005. This meets the requirement for
identification of the index case of vesicular stomatitis for a newly
affected State. Virus isolation results for this horse are pending.
Serologic tests and virus isolation on a 2nd horse with clinical signs
consistent with vesicular stomatitis on the premises are also pending.
There are 9 clinically normal horses and 2 clinically normal sheep also
present on the premises.
The 2 affected horses were taken on a pleasure ride on 22 May 2005 in the
southeastern part of the state along the Escalante River, where the owner
noticed an abundance of biting flies and insects. The owner 1st noticed the
animals were sick a little over a week later on 31 May 2005.
A subsequent case of vesicular stomatitis was also diagnosed by NVSL on 17
Jun 2005 in a horse on a premises in Davis County, Utah, near the town of
West Bountiful. Vesicular stomatitis has not been seen in this part of the
state in past outbreaks.
In Arizona, 3 new vesicular stomatitis-positive premises were identified
during this reporting period. One of the 3 is located in a new county,
Graham County. Also in Arizona, 2 positive premises were released from
quarantine during this reporting period.
No new vesicular stomatitis-positive premises were reported in Texas or New
Mexico.

[Vesicular stomatitis produces vesicles or blister-like lesions in the
mouth. The animal is very uncomfortable, and the differential diagnosis is
foot and mouth Disease, which does not affect horses.
Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease which primarily affects horses,
cattle, and swine. The agent that causes vesicular stomatitis, VSV, has a
wide host range and can occasionally infect sheep and goats. In affected
livestock, VSV causes blister-like lesions to form in the mouth and on the
dental pad, tongue, lips, nostrils, hooves, and teats. These blisters swell
and break, leaving raw tissue that is so painful that infected animals
generally refuse to eat and drink and show signs of lameness. Severe weight
loss usually follows, and, in dairy cows, a severe drop in milk production
commonly occurs. Affected dairy cattle can appear to be normal and will
continue to eat about half of their feed intake. - Mod.TG]
