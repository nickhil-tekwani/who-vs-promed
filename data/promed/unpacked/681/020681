Colombian livestock owners are worried by the appearance last Monday of
foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreaks. It is close to the frontier with
Venezuela, and they fear that the disease will enter the country and that
they will lose their international certification for that region.
"The situation is very grave. There is an imminent risk of losing our
certification of being free of foot-and-mouth disease," said Jorge Visbal,
President of the National Federation of Cattlemen (Fedegan).
The announcement of these new outbreaks, this time in Maldonado, Tachira
State, has resulted in Colombia declaring a month-long quarantine zone as
of 22 Aug 2003 for the departments of Norte de Santander, Cesar, Guajira,
and Aruca, in the northern region of the country.
This decision prohibits the movement of any cattle, pigs, goats, buffalo,
or sheep out of these departments to any other part of Colombia. Visbal has
called for a state of national emergency and for increased efforts in
stopping the illegal movements of meat and milk products.
The last FMD outbreak in Colombia was in August 2002, and 52 percent of the
national herd of 22 million head are believed to be free of this disease.
The principal markets for Colombian beef are Venezuela, Peru, and various
islands of the Caribbean.
