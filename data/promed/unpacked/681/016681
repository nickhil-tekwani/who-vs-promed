On Mon 6 Sep 2010, the spokesperson of the Hessen Environment Ministry in
Wiesbaden revealed that 2 additional cases of equine infectious anemia
[EIA] have been detected in horses in the German state of Hessen: one in
Marburg-Biedenkopf district and the other in Kassel district.

The 2 new cases followed the detection of an EIA case in Lahn-Dill
district, Hessen, last week [1 Sep 2010 -- the previous case was,
reportedly, in the village Inselhof, Huettenberg, Lahn-Dill district, as
officially reported to the OIE; see ProMED-mail 20100904.3180 - Mod.AS].
Both horses were illegally imported from Romania to Germany. The
investigation of possible additional infections in contact animals is
continuing. The horse in Kassel was held in a stable with 19 other horses;
the stable in Marburg-Biedenkopf included 2 animals.

[The press release also includes a concise overview of EIA, indicating that
this chronic equine disease does not affect humans. It also stresses that
infected animals are to be euthanized, since no therapy or vaccination are
available. - Mod.AS]

[On 6 Sep 2010, Germany submitted a follow-up report to the OIE addressing
the 2 additional cases in Hessen (in the villages Roemershausen,
Gladenbach, Marburg-Biedenkopf and Weimar 10-404-00008, Ahnatal, Kassel)
mentioned above. The report states the origin of infection as "illegal
movement of animals".

According to the current and a previous press release from the Hessian
Ministry, all 3 EIA-infected horses in the 3 districts (Lahn-Dill, Kassel,
and Marburg-Biedenkopf), belonged to the same lot, imported (illegally?)
from Romania. The locations of the 3 outbreaks are available on the OIE map
at <http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=9660>.

In early January 2010, the UK reported having detected EIA in 2 horses of a
consignment coming from Romania via Belgium. This was followed by an
investigation in Belgium, launched on 20 Jan 2010, revealing that as early
as 21 Oct 2009, 18 horses arrived from Romania at a dealer's establishment
at Drongen, of which 9 horses were sent to the UK, where the disease was
diagnosed. The other 9 horses were sold and resold among several
establishments in Belgium before being traced back. An epidemiological
investigation followed, eventually detecting 7 EIA outbreaks throughout
Belgium so far (see reports and map at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&this_country_code=BEL&reportid=8917>.

Results of the current investigations in Germany, regarding the route of
introduction and steps to be taken, are anticipated. Had the horses been
tested in their premises of origin, in Romania -- a country known to be
heavily EIA-infected? Were they accompanied by health certificates? See
also commentary and additional sources in ProMED-mail 20100209.0439. - Mod.AS
