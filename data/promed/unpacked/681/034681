WHO on Friday confirmed that the epidemic of haemorrhagic fever in
northeastern DRC is not due to the Ebola virus, but could be caused by the
related Marburg virus. One of five samples analysed in South Africa tested
positive for Marburg virus, the other four were negative.
[Other articles have mentioned that just the one specimen was strongly
positive, with 3 others weakly positive. It does raise the question of what
has been going on in the Congo -- are there mixed causes? - MPP
