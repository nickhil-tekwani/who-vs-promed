Trypanosomiasis: distribution of vectors for _T. cruzi_
-------------------------------------------------------
Just wanted to clarify the geographic distribution of the natural vectors
for _Trypanosoma cruzi_, the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease. Hemiptera
insects belonging to family Reduviidae, subfamily Triatominae, have an
extensive geographic distribution in the Western Hemisphere, extending
roughly from the middle of Argentina and Chile up through the middle of the
US (1). They are popularly known as "kissing bugs" or "assassin bugs" in
the southern US, as "pitos" or "vinchucas" in much of Latin America, and as
"barbeiros" in Portuguese Brazil. _T. cruzi_ has been isolated from
sylvatic animals as far north as the state of Maryland in the US (2), but
no human infection has been reported there.

Distribution of triatomid bugs
------------------------------
Just a quick note to remind you that triatomid bugs are indeed found
outside of South America. There are numerous sites in Texas where the bugs
have been collected, and a genetic algorithm for rule-set
prediction-generated ecologic niche model predicts a large area of
infestation. Unlike the case in most of South and Central America,
triatomid bugs have actually been collected from areas near suburban
houses. (Beard CB, et al. EID 9 January 2003

[We are grateful for the comments on the distribution of triatomid bugs
from Kathleen Whitaker and Alberto Acosta. The suggestion that the patient
has some form of trypanosomiasis seems even more unlikely, now that it
seems established that neither triatomid bugs nor tsetse flies are found in
Asia. ProMED has had no comment from the physicians in India handling the
patient, and we suggest that the case not be regarded as trypanosomiasis
until evidence for the infection is provided and confirmed by experienced
laboratories. - Mod.EP]
