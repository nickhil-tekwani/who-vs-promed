I know of a specific ELISA that uses a recombinant antigen to detect
antibodies for Leishmaniasis. I used to work for the company and had a hand
in creating it. Due to the recombinant antigen, there is little
cross-reactivity.

We have used PCR to detect _Leishmania infantum_ in bone marrow and lymph
nodes of dogs with leishmaniasis in Spain, and it works. We send our samples
to a private lab, Centre Immunologic de Catalunya, Calle Tajo 33 08023
Barcelona, Spain, phone 34 3 3587567. Please call or send a letter to this
lab and you can get more information about manufactures, etc..
Another option is to contact Dr Xavi Roure for more information at the
Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona (UAB) Facultat de Veterinaria, Hospital
Clinic Veterinari, 08193 Bellaterra (Barcelona) phone 34 3 5811894, fax 34 3
5812006; he is working with PCR on canine leishmaniasis.
