Russia: Increasing Number of Cases of CCHF in the Southern Federal District
-------------------------------------------------------------
This year [2006], the number of people who have fallen ill with
Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has risen in the Rostov
Region, according to Vladimir Ryzhkov, the head of the Department of
Epidemiological Surveillance in Rostov-on-Don. Ryzhkov stated that
this year, 47 cases, including 5 fatalities, have been recorded so
far, whereas during the corresponding period last year [2005], only
16 cases were reported.
Vladimir Ryzhkov stated that in the Southern Federal District, cases
of CCHF had already been reported in Dagestan, Kalmykia, and
Stavropol, and in the Volgograd, Astrakhan and Rostov Regions. Now
cases of CCHF are being reported in the 12 southeastern districts of
the Rostov Region: Zavetinskiy, Salskiy, Tselinskiy, Proletarskiy,
Orlovskiyl, Peschanokopskiy, Tsymlyanskiy, Zimovnikovskiy,
Remontnenskiy, Dubovskiy, Martynovsliy and the city of Volgodonsk.
Vladimir Ryzhkov stated that the increasing number of CCHF cases is associated
with an increase in the density of ticks in the environment. This year [2006],
2492 persons (including 469 children under 14 years of age) have sought
medical attention in hospitals and out-patient departments for tick bites,
1000 more than during the orresponding period last year [2005].
Ryzhkov added that a sum of 2 750 000 roubles [USD 102 000] has been allocated
from the city [Rostov-on-Don] budget for tick eradication measures.
