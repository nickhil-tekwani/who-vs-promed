Shanghai will suspend live poultry trading from 31 Jan 2014, the 1st day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, until 30 Apr 2014 to prevent a recurrence of the bird flu.

The suspension will be an annual feature for the next 5 years, dependent on the evaluation and warning of the bird flu and the seasonal onset, according to a joint statement issued by the Shanghai Agricultural Commission and the Shanghai Commerce Commission.

All the designated wholesale and retail markets will be banned from trading in poultry, and violators face hefty fines between RMB 10 000 [USD 1641] and RMB 30 000 [USD 4924] under a new rule that took effect in June [2013].

Unlicensed street vendors who sell live poultry during the period will be punished by urban management teams.

Poultry from other cities and provinces must be sent to designated slaughterhouses and cannot enter the local market directly, it said.

Residents are being urged to report any illegal trades of live poultry to market watchdogs on hotline 12315 of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Administrative Bureau, 12331 of the Shanghai Food and Drug Administrative Bureau, 12316 of the Shanghai Agricultural Commission, and city's urban management at 52921111 or 63166666.

In April this year [2013], all live poultry markets were shut down in Shanghai after 43 people died of H7N9 bird flu in China.

The ban was lifted in June [2013], and about 110 poultry markets returned to business.

Experts have said there was a possibility of H7N9 recurrence and suggested a complete ban on live poultry business.

China's mainland has reported 5 cases of H7N9 this autumn ­- 3 of them in neighboring Zhejiang Province.

The mainland has reported 134 cases by the end of September 2013, with 45 fatalities, according to the National Health and Family Planning Commission.

[Note that a version of this media report was posted earlier as part of the human disease thread (Avian influenza, human (148): China (HK) H7N9, 1st case; Archive Number: 20131203.2087599) and is now reposted for additional commentary. - Mod.LM

In June 2013, 2 of China's leading researchers, Wu Ying and George F. Gao, wrote (ref 1):

"There are some discussions as to whether or not we should permanently shut down the live market as it challenges the traditional lifestyle and has side-effects on the economy. The agriculture sector argues that the H7N9 does not cause any diseases for poultry, [and] therefore it should not be called avian influenza virus; whereas Li et al. unambiguously demonstrated the relatedness of human infection with poultry or poultry related markets. The question can be open for further discussion and we also need to see the circulation trends of the virus in the future. At least this virus should be called avian-origin influenza virus. Preliminary estimates show that the agriculture sector lost at least RMB 57 billion [USD 9.36 billion] because of the live free market shut-down. Therefore this outbreak is not only a health problem but also a serious economic issue. Burden of disease (BOD) caused by this H7N9 outbreak should be [assessed] in the near future to guide our future disease control and prevention."

A later paper (Ref 2) provided collected data supporting the closure of live poultry markets (LPM):

"A total of 85 human cases of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection were reported in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Huzhou, and Nanjing by 7 Jun 2013, of which 60 were included in our main analysis. Closure of LPMs reduced the mean daily number of infections by 99 percent (95 percent credibility interval 93­-100 percent) in Shanghai, by 99 percent (92-­100 percent) in Hangzhou, by 97 percent (68­-100 percent) in Huzhou, and by 97 percent (81­-100 percent) in Nanjing. Because LPMs were the predominant source of exposure to avian influenza A H7N9 virus for confirmed cases in these cities, we estimated that the mean incubation period was 3.3 days (range 1.4-5.7)."

The author concluded: "LPM closures were effective in the control of human risk of avian influenza A H7N9 virus infection in the spring of 2013. In the short term, LPM closure should be rapidly implemented in areas where the virus is identified in live poultry or people. In the long term, evidence-based discussions and deliberations about the role of market rest days and central slaughtering of all live poultry should be renewed."

It remains to be seen if Shanghai's example will be followed by other municipalities affected by H7N9 in eastern China.
