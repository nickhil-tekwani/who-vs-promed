UNDIAGNOSED DEATHS - BRAZIL (SANTOS, SP)

[The local press reported several deaths with symptoms of hepatitis &
hemorrhage since late April 1999 near Santos, Sao Paulo state, Brazil -
Mod.JW]
There were 6 unlinked deaths. One was due to bacterial sepsis (_Pseudomonas
aeruginosa_) secondary to pyelonephritis, another was due to fulminant
hepatitis B. The other 4 are awaiting further testing, but seem to have no
common ground, either epidemiological or clinical.

There seems to be no outbreak in Santos. It is definitely not hantavirus,
leptospirosis, dengue or yellow fever.
