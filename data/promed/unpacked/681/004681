The high cost of pesticides and an outbreak of stem rust is threatening the current crop of wheat on many farms in the North Rift. Farmers say the disease has been aggravated by heavy rains currently pounding parts of the region. They are now struggling to control the disease. "There is no money, and wheat producers cannot afford the skyrocketing cost of pesticides to control diseases. Crop yields will definitely reduce further at the end of this [2019] season," a farmer [said]. Others said the spraying did not help.

The County Executive for Agriculture said with heavy rains wheat rust was common in the region. "It is recommended that farmers spray after every 21 days during heavy rains for optimal production. Wheat cover in the county has gradually reduced due to challenges posed by the fungal disease." He said his department lacked pesticides to control wheat rust. Current acreage under wheat might reduce further unless the farmers received subsidies and incentives.

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ (previously f.sp. _tritici_). Overall yield losses of up to 80 percent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw or other contaminated materials. The fungus can survive between seasons on some grasses or volunteer wheat generating a "green bridge". Alternatively, it can also produce hardy teliospores which in the next season infect members of the genus _Berberis_, which then serve as a source of crop inoculum. Disease monitoring is important so that timely action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up of inoculum. Disease management may include fungicide applications, control of volunteer wheat and resistant varieties if available.

Races with increased virulence are emerging frequently and resistance breeding programmes have been set up by several countries or international groups. One of the most serious threats at present is considered to be the Ug99 family of strains (first discovered in Uganda in 1999), which have overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties. Additional resistance genes have been overcome by subsequent variants (see for example, ProMED-mail post 20100602.1834). At least 8 variants within the Ug99 lineage have been reported throughout Africa, such as Robin (resistance genes Sr2 and SrTmp) which affects the wheat variety resistant to the original Ug99 and therefore widely planted in Kenya (ProMED-mail post 20150204.3141068).

New strains not related to Ug99 are also posing a danger, for example the Digalu strain with 2 distinct genotypes (see ProMED-mail post 20180219.5638265) spreading in Europe, for which variants with virulence to 4 additional host resistance genes have been identified.

It is not clear which stem rust race is considered to be the cause of the outbreak in the report above, but the emergence of yet another stem rust race in Kenya may be a possibility.
