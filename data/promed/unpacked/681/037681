It is not being called an epidemic, but another case of rabies in
Cumberland County (North Carolina, US) was confirmed Friday -- the third
this month. It is enough to make animal control officials worried.
The most recent incident happened Wednesday when a fox attacked a dog tied
in a yard along Wall Street in Linden. The owner of the dog killed the fox,
and the animal tested positive for rabies, Animal Control Director Carlton
Person said. The dog had to be destroyed.
The cases have been in rural areas surrounding Linden.
"Anytime you have a rabies incident it is a serious matter but it is
nothing to panic about," Person said. However, the seriousness has
suspended all adoptions of animals within the Linden area unless owners
have papers documenting an animal has received a rabies shot, Person said.
Marc Joseph, the chairman of the county Animal Control Board, said he has
been talking with county Health Department Director Jesse Williams about
the cases. It is too early to call it an epidemic, Joseph believes.
The county was considered under a rabies epidemic in the mid-1990s, but
until these recent cases, there had not been a confirmed rabies case in
nearly two years. The first incident involved a bat 29 days ago.
People who get pets from any source should get them vaccinated as soon as
possible. State law requires that all dogs and cats be vaccinated for
rabies by a licensed veterinarian after they reach 4 months old. Pet owners
who fail to do so are subject to a county-imposed fine of $100, Smith said.
