Authorities are on alert after the increase in the number of people suspected of having Haff syndrome in the states of Amazonas and Bahia.

Haff Syndrome, known as "black urine" disease, is caused by a toxin found in certain fish and shellfish. The substance causes damage to the muscular system and organs such as kidneys. Information is from R7.

At least 25 cases are under analysis, 19 of them in the city of Itacoatiara (Amazonas) and another 6 in 5 municipalities in Bahia: Alagoinhas, Simoes Filho, Marau, Mata de Sao Jorge, and Salvador.

According to the health surveillance, in Amazonas the suspicion is those infected have consumed freshwater fish. Of the 19 cases in Itacoatiara, 8 are hospitalized.

The director of the epidemiological surveillance of Bahia, Marcia Sao Pedro, explained the cases are still under investigation, and the foods consumed by patients are undergoing laboratory analysis. "Patients may have rhabdomyolysis for other causes," said Marcia.

Haff syndrome
---------------
The "black urine disease" is a type of rhabdomyolysis, a name given to a syndrome generating the destruction of skeletal muscle fibers and release of elements from within the fibers (such as electrolytes, myoglobins, and proteins) into the blood.

The name was given because of the discovery of the disease in a lake called Frisches Haff, in the Koningsberg region in 1924. The territory, on the Baltic Sea, belonged to Germany, but was later incorporated into Russia, constituting an enclave between Poland and Lithuania.

Haff's disease causes muscle stiffness. In addition, the appearance of dark urine is often a consequence of renal failure, which is why this expression is used to refer to the disease.

In an article about the disease, doctors at the Hospital Sao Lucas Copacabana explain there has been no confirmation yet about the nature of the toxin contained in the fish whose ingestion caused the disease. In some books it is associated with arsenic poisoning.

To G1, the infectologist Mariana Tassara explained the toxin can be developed in raw or cooked fish, since it is thermostable and not eliminated at high temperatures. "The packaging of this fish can cause this toxin, which causes food poisoning. As it is a very rare syndrome, there is no need to panic," explained the doctor.

Also, according to experts, the toxin has neither specific taste nor smell, which makes its perception more complex. It is also not eliminated by the fish cooking process.

In the reports recorded over the years, people affected by the disease ate different types of fish, such as salmon, pacu-butter, pirapitinga, tambaqui, and different families, such as Cambaridae and Parastacidae.

[Haff's disease has a variety of symptoms. The variety can make diagnosis more complicated. History is clearly helpful. It is a challenging condition, as it has occurred with a variety of fish species, and in a variety of locations worldwide.

Some of the reported symptoms include
- muscle pain and stiffness
- light- to dark-brown urine
- nausea
- chest pain
- vomiting
- shortness of breath
- profuse sweating
- pain to light touch

Dry mouth, numbness of thighs or whole body, back pain, and stomach cramps are also reported, but less frequently.

Editorial note
---------------
"During the 1920s, the name 'Haff disease' was given to an illness characterized by severe muscle pain and stiffness that affected approximately 1000 persons living along the Koenigsberg Haff, a brackish inlet of the Baltic Sea (1). Subsequent similar outbreaks were identified in Sweden and the former Soviet Union (2-4). Although the etiology was not determined, epidemiologic investigations linked illness to ingestion of fish, especially burbot.

"The 1st reported case of Haff disease in the United States occurred in Texas in 1984 (M. Tormey, Los Angeles Department of Health Services, personal communication, 1997); 5 additional cases were reported in California during 1984-1986. All US cases have been associated with eating buffalo fish.

"Haff disease typically presents as a paroxysm of rhabdomyolysis, with accompanying muscle tenderness, rigidity, and dark-brown urine. However, . . . milder presentations also occur. Although the median incubation period for the patients . . . was 8 hours (range 6-21 hours), symptoms generally appear approximately 18 hours after eating fish.

"Laboratory features of Haff disease include a markedly elevated CK [creatine kinase] level with an MB fraction of less than 5%. Levels of other muscle enzymes (e.g., lactate dehydrogenase, glutamate oxalate transaminase, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase) also are elevated. Myoglobinuria is often mistaken for gross hematuria (5). Diagnosis is based on a compatible clinical history.

"Treatment is supportive and consists of administering large volumes of fluid early in the course of illness to prevent myoglobin toxicity to the renal tubules (5). Possible complications include electrolyte disturbances, renal failure, and disseminated intra-vascular coagulation. Symptoms usually resolve within 2-3 days. Historically, the case-fatality rate is approximately 1% (1).

"Clinicians and public health practitioners are encountering an increasing variety of foodborne illnesses, in part because of a diversification of food preparation and eating habits. International travelers, members of ethnic groups with unique cuisines, and consumers of both imported and domestic specialty food items may be at risk for foodborne illnesses that are rare or have not been reported previously in the United States. Clinicians should be aware of food exposures that pose a risk to their patients and routinely obtain food histories, even from those patients whose illness may not appear to be food related.

"Physicians who identify or suspect cases of Haff disease, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory parameters, and food history, should report them to public health authorities for initiation of traceback and recall of implicated food items. In the United States, State health departments are requested to report to the Foodborne and Diarrheal Diseases Branch, Division of Bacterial and Mycotic Diseases, National Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC.
