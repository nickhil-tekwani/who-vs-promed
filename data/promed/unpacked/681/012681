Salmonella from raw peanut dust resulting from a roof leak?...; have
people who eat raw peanuts had a problem with _Salmonella_?
I think a much more plausible explanation would be that bird
droppings from the roof of the factory likely dripped onto the floors
and machinery due to the roof leak. It seems to me that raw foods are
taking a bad rap lately for problems that are actually from other
problems or faults in the processes.

[ProMED thanks Ms. King for her comments. Clearly the original source
of the _S._ Tennessee is something other than the peanut or any other
raw produce. The product has to be contaminated in the field, during
processing or during its route to the consumer. Just how the organism
arrived in the processing plant is unknown. Whether entering the
plant on the shell of the peanuts, through the leak, in the stool of
a worker, or otherwise, the warmth and moisture function to allow the
organisms to replicate and increase the chances of an outbreak. -
