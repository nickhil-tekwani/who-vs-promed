Complete poultry standstill in the Netherlands
----------------------------------------------
Following the possible outbreak of fowl plague in Opsel (Limburg), Minister
Veerman of Agriculture, Nature Management and Fisheries, has announced a
complete standstill in the entire country, banning all movement of animals
susceptible to fowl plague as well as various related products. The
standstill is valid for an unlimited period.
During the standstill, investigations are to be carried out to find out
how the infection reached Opsel and whether there are other new foci of
infection.
During the fowl plague crisis, several restrictions on the transport of
poultry and their products have been lifted; following the serious
suspicion of disease in Opsel, these restrictions are back in force. Hence,
from this afternoon, 13.30 pm, it is forbidden to transport animals which
are susceptible to fowl plague. This includes also ungulates if their
origin is on infected premises. The transport of hatching eggs, table-eggs,
used bedding and manure from poultry farms and from mixed farms is banned
as well. Vehicles used for poultry transportation may not be moved. The
import and export of poultry and hatching eggs are forbidden. The transport
of raw milk from farms which maintain poultry, and the supply of animal
feed to farms which maintain poultry, is no longer allowed.
Visiting arrangements remain valid: any contact between visitors and
poultry should be prevented. Holders of fowl pest-susceptible animals, both
on commercial or pet-animal premises, are obliged to take all measures to
prevent further spread of infection, including the construction of
partitions. They are further required to maintain registration of visitors.
Visits of persons who are required to visit farms on professional grounds
(such as veterinarians and transporters), are permitted under specified
conditions.

According to agricultural minister Cees Veerman, the leap of the fowl plague
virus into the very centre of the poultry area in Brabant and Limburg was
caused by movement of people or their transport vehicles. Such persons have
broken rules of hygiene and caused infections. The Ministry of Agriculture
is dismayed by the introduction of the virus into a turkey farm
in Opsel, Limburg. Opsel is situated in the heart of the North-Limburg and
East-Brabant concentration area of the poultry industry, with 31 million
chickens and turkeys, about 3 times the number in the Gelders Valley.
A 10-km radius zone around Opsel has been sealed off.

Netherland Troops Control Spread of Flu
----------------------------------------
The government has called on army troops to help contain an outbreak of
bird flu that could threaten the country's poultry industry, the
agriculture Minister said Friday.
Bird flu, or avian influenza, is usually harmless for humans but can
devastate stocks of domesticated birds.
More than 9 million chickens have been slaughtered on 800 farms in the
eastern Dutch province of Gelderland to prevent the disease spreading since
the outbreak began in late February 2003.
The agriculture ministry said Friday that the outbreak has now likely
spread to farms in 2 additional southern areas.
Agriculture Minister Cees Veerman said the troops will help enforce a
quarantine around the farm in Limburg, in the heart of the Dutch chicken
farming industry. The province has borders with both Germany and Belgium.
Ministry spokesman Benno Bruggink said checkpoints will be set up to ensure
no fowl enter or leave the area.
Dutch exports of fowl and poultry products have been stopped since the
start of the outbreak, which is believed to have been caused by contact
between wild ducks and farm poultry.

Pigs in mixed farms to be tested for fowl plague
------------------------------------------------
Pigs present on farms where poultry got infected with fowl plague (Highly
Pathogenic Avian Influenza, HPAI) are also to be tested. Animal owners are
obliged by law to cooperate. This has been announced by the Ministry of
Agriculture on Thursday. Untested pigs will not be allowed to remain in
mixed farms where poultry got infected. The ministry wants to know whether
the AI virus is, or may be, spread through pigs.

[The measures announced by the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, including
movement restrictions on ungulates from infected premises, are almost
draconian but should be evaluated in view of the deterioration of the HPAI
situation there. According to today's information by the Ministry, 177
premises, including 168 poultry farms and 9 "pet avian premises," have been
found definitely infected since the beginning of the epizootic, 5 weeks
ago. 28 additional outbreaks -- including 5 on "pet avian premises" -- are
currently "seriously suspected." So far, 9.7 million HPAI-susceptible
poultry have been culled. - Mod.AS]
