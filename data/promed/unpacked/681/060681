Fungus affects 4000 hectares of rice in El Oro
----------------------------------------------
Some 600 rice farmers in Arenillas (El Oro province) are desperate due to a fungus affecting cereal crops whose origin is unknown, as reported by one of the farmers.

He said that within days the disease has spread at an alarming rate in the rice fields, damaging more than 4000 hectares. Others claim that the disease takes 120 days to develop, becoming more intense in the last stage of crop growth. "After 90 days the ears are dry and the grain turns black," said another farmer.

Insecticides and fertilisers have been used on the affected crops without any beneficial effects. What remains of the crops would not even cover the farmers' expenditures. 80 percent of farmers in that region depend on production of rice.

[More than 30 fungal pathogens are known to affect rice crops worldwide, and a number of these have been reported in the Americas, including for example rice blast (_Magnaporthe oryzae_), black smut (_Tilletia barclayana_), bakanae (_Gibberella fujikuroi_) and sheath blight (_Thanatephorus cucumeris_).

Although the story above states that a fungus is the cause of the problems in El Oro, it is not clear how this conclusion has been arrived at and whether perhaps the term "fungus" is merely used as a general description of an infectious crop disease, without diagnostic proof of an actual pathogen. Therefore, since bacterial panicle blight (_Burkholderia glumae_) is rife in the region, this disease may also need to be considered.
