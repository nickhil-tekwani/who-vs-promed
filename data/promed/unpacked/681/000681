[see
Yersiniosis, infants - USA (Texas) 970723133356}
In Missouri we have a pattern of yersiniosis in very young black infants
associated with the Thankgiving/Christmas holidays and pork intestines.
CDC did a write-up of young black children in Atlanta. Is it possible you
have an association of childcare and preparing an ethnic meal?
