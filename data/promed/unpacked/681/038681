The Directorate General of Public Health, an agency of the Ministry of Health, yesterday confirmed 6 new cases in the [legionellosis] outbreak, which was detected in the town last Friday [18 Dec 2015] and has already affected 26 people.

Speaking to The Tribune, the director general of public health, Manuel Tordera, said that the department has been working since then to find the source of the outbreak, and so for that purpose the emergency protocol was activated and samples were collected at all places likely to harbor the bacteria that cause this disease, such as cooling towers, public fountains (which are currently not in operation), washing units, evaporative condensers, etc. As of yesterday, 103 establishments were inspected and 33 samples were taken at different points in the city, mainly the industrial and downtown areas, of which 2 potential positives are being confirmed through other tests.

Although the possibility that the source was in the industrial area was prominent at the beginning, it is now more likely that the source is in the urban center. Although there is no particular pattern, the industrial area "was studied because 3 of the 5 people affected had it in common and the other 2 were not from Manzanares", but after results of the 1st analysis, and the lack of further cases linked to that area, the Ministry of Health does not rule out [the possibility] that there may be 2 hot spots near the center.

Samples have been sent to the Regional Laboratory of Food, Agriculture and Environment of Castilla-La Mancha (Laraga), located in Talavera de la Reina, and the results will be known in 4-5 days, said Tordera, who calls for calm and tranquility, since "the situation is under control", although there are several locals who have called this newspaper concerned that they are still unaware of the source and the possible consequences of this outbreak. In response, the director general of public health said that the disease is not spread by contact between people or by ingestion of food or water. While reiterating that it is possible that in the coming hours the number of those affected could grow because the of incubation period of [legionnaires' disease]; that is, since the time between contracting the disease and onset of symptoms is between 2 and 10 days, and yesterday was the 8th since the beginning of the outbreak.

The Association of the Patient Advocate has asked the chief prosecutor of Ciudad Real, Luis Huete, to open an official investigation to find the source and determine responsible parties.

At press time, sources from the Public Health Service (SESCAM) confirmed 26 cases of [legionellosis], of whom 9 are hospitalized and 1 of them, a woman aged 55, remains in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the Hospital of Ciudad Real. There are also 6 new cases, says Tordera, though "none had to be admitted as they are not of severe clinical status."

A 73 year old man, who was admitted to the ICU as part of the outbreak of [legionellosis] in Manzanares (Ciudad Real), died on Tuesday morning [22 Dec 2015], as health officials have confirmed. He is the 2nd person to die during this outbreak; an 84 year old man died on Monday [21 Dec 2015].

The health service of Castilla-La Mancha (SESCAM) has confirmed that as of 15.00 on Tuesday [22 Dec 2015], they have registered 141 confirmed cases of [legionellosis], of whom 2 people have died, 2 remain in the ICU at the General Hospital of Ciudad Real, and 107 have not required hospitalization. In a press release, the health service said they have reinforced human and material resources at the Points of Continued Attention in Manzanares and the Emergency Hospital Virgen de Altagracia, as well as internal medicine services, to treat detected cases.

The outbreak of legionnaires' disease that is affecting the town of Manzanares is the most virulent in the history of Castilla-La Mancha, as confirmed by the director general of public health, Manuel Tordera. The minister of health, Jesus Fernandez, said that of the 103 points that were investigated, 2 are being investigated in depth.

He also noted that the number of cases may increase until 23 or 24 Dec 2015, when the incubation period ends, although new cases "are minimal", even though the total number is increased [?].

[Manzanares, with a population of 18 924 in 2014, is a municipality in the province of Ciudad Real, the autonomous community of Castile-La Mancha, Spain. A map of Spain showing the location of Manzanares can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/13200+Manzanares,+Cdad.+Real,+Spain/.

At the time of last report, on 17 Dec 2015 (ProMED-mail: Legionellosis - Spain (02): (CM) 20151217.3869362), there were only 5 cases of suspected legionnaires' disease in the city of Manzanares, Spain. Now, almost 2 weeks after the beginning of the outbreak, there are 141 confirmed cases, with 2 deaths. Of over 100 sites that have been investigated as potential sources, 2 "are being investigated in depth"; but none have been confirmed to be a source and none apparently have been remediated. So, until the source has been found and eliminated, further cases can be expected. Matching the genotype of clinical and environmental isolates of legionella, the cause of legionnaires' disease, can help identify transmission pathways.
