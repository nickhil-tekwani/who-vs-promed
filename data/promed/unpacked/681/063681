India: Outbreak of Undiagnosed Jaundice in Ahmedabad
----------------------------------------------------
Jaundice has claimed 3 lives in the city, and more than 120 cases
have been registered in the eastern suburbs, where this water-borne
disease has assumed near-epidemic proportions. Sources in the Health
Department of the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) have
confirmed the death of a resident of Gayatrinagar, who was admitted
to L. G. Hospital last week. 2 deaths had already been reported from
New Bhavaninagar and Gayatrinagar of the Amraiwadi area here. The
majority of the jaundice cases were registered from these areas in
the last few days. As many as 14 cases have been registered from the
Nava Vadaj area of the city.
It is learnt that the contamination of drinking water supplied to
Amraiwadi and other eastern suburbs is the main cause of the disease.
Officials of the AMC's Health and Engineering departments have been
asked to get to the source of contamination.

[Water-borne hepatitis can usually be attributed to infection by
either hepatitis A virus or hepatitis E virus, 2 unrelated enteric
viruses, as a result of faecal contamination of water-supplies.
Hepatitis A virus infection generally resolves without complication,
and effective vaccines are available for prevention and control of
epidemics. Hepatitis E virus, which was first isolated in India, has
been responsible for outbreaks throughout the sub-continent (and
elsewhere) and although usually associated with acute self-limiting
disease, can be more threatening, particularly for women in late
pregnancy. No vaccine is available at present. Further information on
the course and outcome of the outbreak and the identity of the
etiologic agent would be appreciated. - Mod.CP]
