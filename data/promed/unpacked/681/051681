Namibia: Anthrax Confirmed in Caprivi
---------------------------------------------
The Directorate of Veterinary Services in the Caprivi Region today
[23 Oct 2006] starts mass vaccination of cattle in the area,
following an outbreak of anthrax that has killed livestock and wild
animals. The disease is said to have originated from the Chobe
National Park in Botswana, where it is believed to have killed dozens
of wild animals. It spread to Namibia through animals that freely
wander between the 2 countries.
Last Friday, officials from neighboring Botswana and their Namibian
counterparts convened an urgent meeting in the Caprivi to discuss
control measures that could be implemented to prevent increased
deaths in the wildlife population, after an outbreak was declared in
September 2006 in Botswana. Dr Frank Chitate of the Veterinary
Directorate confirmed to New Era that officials from the Department
of Animal Health and Production, the police, the Ministry of
Environment and Tourism, the Ministry of Health and Social Services
and others from the Department of Wildlife and Parks, had met to
discuss how the outbreak could be contained, taking into
consideration that it affects both countries.
So far, 4 elephants and 8 zebras are known to have died from the
disease on the Namibian side of the border. However, Chitate says the
figures are likely to be higher than this. One person suspected to
have contracted the disease, Chitate said, has been admitted to the
Katima Mulilo state hospital, but efforts to get comment from health
officials proved fruitless.
In Botswana, a mass vaccination has started already, while in Namibia
the exercise commences today [23 Oct 2006]. At least 180 000 doses of
vaccines were procured from South Africa last week. Chitate revealed
that 5000 doses of vaccines for rabies were also purchased for dogs
and cats. About 16 veterinary officers and supervisors will be
involved in the exercise that will take between 7 and 8 weeks. "Time
and again, we receive cases of rabies in the region, and when we do
campaign for anthrax, we also do the same for rabies," Chitate said.
The anthrax outbreak was 1st reported in the Chobe wildlife area in
September 2006. Though there was one suspected case in Namibia at the
time, laboratory results could not confirm whether the animal died
from the said disease due to its decomposed body. The vet explained
it was difficult to detect for certain whether the animal died from
anthrax or possibly another disease.
Early this month [October 2006], Chitate said, animals started dying
in Caprivi, and on 7 Oct 2006, it was confirmed that animals died
from anthrax. He strongly urged all farmers in Caprivi to take their
cattle for vaccination against the deadly virulent bacteria.
Vaccination will be done for free.
Considering that the disease can affect humans too, Chitate urged
people in the region not to eat meat of an animal that dies on its
own (from natural causes). Though uncommon among people, the disease
can also infect human beings who feast on infected carcasses, he
warned. "We urge farmers not to eat any carcass just in case the
animal died from anthrax," he cautioned. Separate vaccination
campaigns already took place in July 2006, as the Caprivi region is
known to have sporadic cases of this disease.
Cases were also reported in January 2005, when about 3 cattle were
affected. In 2004, the area was hard hit by the spread of the same
disease, with scores of livestock dying after displaying anthrax
symptoms. Dozens of elephants and buffalo in Botswana, especially in
Chobe National Park, also died from the disease.
