Foot and Mouth Disease in Kenya
-------------------------------
The Busia District veterinary officers have imposed quarantine in 2
divisions following an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.
The District Veterinary Officer (DVO), Dr Wycliffe Murekefu, said in a
notice that they had imposed the quarantine in Matayos and Butula divisions
after animals tested positive for foot-and-mouth disease. He said a cow at
Mundulusia area whose sample was taken for testing in Nairobi was positive
but no deaths have been reported yet.
The officer said they had already conducted vaccination in Matayos Division
before they moved over to Butula.
"When we complete the vaccination exercise, we shall review the cases
before we consider opening the markets in those divisions," the officer said.
He said they have also restricted the movement of animals from the affected
areas and outside the divisions in a bid to control the disease.

[FMD is endemic in Kenya. During the first 6 months of 2002, 12 outbreaks
in 9 locations have been reported to the OIE, involving 3 FMD virus
serotypes: O, SAT1 and SAT2. During 2001 and 2000, 54 and 95 outbreaks have
been reported, respectively. In 2001, 757 000 bovines were vaccinated. Our
Kenyan colleagues might clarify whether the above reported outbreaks
involve new areas. - Mod AS]
