At least 18 cases of hemorrhagic dengue have been detected in the southern
zone of Costa Rica, the Health Ministry said Tuesday. Eduardo Sanchez,
director of the Hospital de Golfito said there were about 50 dengue cases
discovered everyday, most of them very serious, but not of the hemorrhagic
type which is particularly deadly. Health Minister Rogelio Pardo started a
regional tour on Tuesday to organize a prevention and attention program.
