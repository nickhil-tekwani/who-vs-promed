[The outbreak continues with the number of deaths having increased from 231
on 2 Sep 2010 to 254 in this report of 8 Sep 2010. Previous reports
indicate that most of these encephalitis cases are not caused by Japanese
encephalitis virus (JEV) infections, but the report above does not mention
JEV infections or non-JEV cases that may be enteroviruses.
