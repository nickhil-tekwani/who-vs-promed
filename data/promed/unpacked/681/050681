The government said Thursday [6 Jan 2011] that up to one million
animals have been culled so far, and one million more could be
destroyed in several days as the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) spreads rapidly throughout the country.

President Lee Myung-bak convened an emergency cabinet meeting at
Cheong Wa Dae to discuss the situation, and instructed ministers to
come up with "fundamental" measures to strengthen monitoring of the
disease and reduce damage, presidential spokeswoman Kim Hee-jung said.

The meeting came amid criticism that the government failed to take
appropriate measures right after the 1st case of the highly
contagious FMD was confirmed on 29 Nov 2010.

Since the outbreak was reported in Andong, North Gyeongsang Province,
the animal disease has spread rapidly, reaching neighboring areas of Seoul.

More than 948 000 cows and pigs have so far been culled, and the
vaccination of hundreds of thousands of animals is underway in some
of the worst-hit areas, according to the Ministry of Food,
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

"More animals will be destroyed," an official said. "The number of
animals to be culled may reach one million."

The farm ministry said it detected 3 additional cases of FMD in the
Chungcheong provinces in the central part of the country and one in
Gyeonnggi Province near Seoul, despite extensive quarantine measures
and the use of vaccines on cattle to stem further outbreaks.

It said that 55 731 pigs and 10 cattle have been destroyed within a
500 meter radius of the farms as a precautionary measure.

The latest outbreaks have pushed up the number of animals to be
destroyed to record high levels, with financial losses estimated to
exceed the 1 trillion won mark (USD 888 million).

The ministry said that it decided to expand vaccinations as FMD has
spread from cattle to other animals [It is not clear why cattle are
regarded by the ministry as the "spreaders" rather than swine, the
latter known as prolific emitters of the FMD virus. - Mod.AS]. It
said up to 210 000 pigs will be inoculated in the coming days.

The Ministry of National Defense said nearly 70 000 troops have been
mobilized to help the government's extensive quarantine efforts.

"The military has so far mobilized some 68 000 soldiers and 770
pieces of military equipment to help stem the spread of FMD,"
ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok told reporters.

The current outbreaks are the severest ever in the country's history.

In the past, only cattle have been given shots as part of an effort
to limit vaccine use. Over 1.2 million cattle have been given shots
since 25 Dec 2010.

[The following comment has been received from Nick Honhold, a
UK-based international consultant veterinary epidemiologist: "I noted
the comparison with culling levels in the UK 2001 outbreak. The other
interesting comparison is the use of widespread automatic contiguous
preemptive culling. This policy failed to prevent spread in the UK
(see various published analyses of the field data from UK) and
seemingly has also failed in South Korea".

According to S. Korea's reporting to the OIE (most recent follow-up
report, No 7, submitted 31 Dec 2010), during the period 29 Nov - 31
Dec 2010, 60 FMD lab-confirmed outbreaks have been reported there.
The affected farms included a total of 73 000 swine (31 cases, 0
dead) and 2980 cattle (114 cases, 0 dead). All 75 980 animals on the
affected farms were destroyed. That means that "automatic contiguous
pre-emptive culling", applied within a 500 meter radius of the
infected farms, has already involved the destruction of susceptible
animals whose number was at least 10-fold the number of animals on
the infected, stamped-out farms. - Mod.AS]
