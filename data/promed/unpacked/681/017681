Meningococcal disease in Niger
--------------------------------
As of 9 Mar 2003, the Ministry of Health, Niger has reported a total of
2056 cases, including 195 deaths in the country since the outbreak began in
February 2003. Of the 42 districts in Niger, 3 districts have reached the
epidemic threshold: Magaria, Aguie, and Matameye, and 4 districts are in
the alert phase: Madarounfa, Madaoua, Tahoua, and Mirriah. Laboratory tests
from samples in these districts confirm _Neisseria meningitidis_ serogroup A.
A mass vaccination campaign is ongoing with the support of Medecins sans
Frontieres. The International Federation of the Red Cross is providing 250
000 doses of vaccine.

[In the ProMED-mail posting Meningococcal disease - Niger 20030307.0567,
there was a report of that 6 out of 130 deaths identified were due to
W135. This current report from WHO confirms that the predominant strain in
circulation in Niger is type A. There was also an earlier report
(Meningococcal disease update 2003 (03) 20030212.0380) mentioning that
vaccine containing the W135 component was going to be distributed in the
African meningitis belt. Given the earlier identification of a small
number of cases of W135, one hopes that vaccine containing the W135
component is now available. - Mod.MPP]
