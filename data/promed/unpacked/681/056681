The Health SEREMI [Regional Health Ministerial Secretariat] of the O'Higgins region, Rafael Borgono, reported on a case of [a] hantavirus [infection] detected recently. "Today [23 Nov 2018] we had confirmation from the Institute for Public Health (ISP) of a 24-year-old man from the Rengo community who is the 4th case of [a] hantavirus [infection] so far in the O'Higgins region this year [2018]. This will be the 1st case in this summer season; the other 3 cases were between January and March of this year [2018]," the authority said.

Borgono explained that, "the patient is from the Rengo community in the Lo de Lobo sector. We are investigating the origin of this disease to find out if it [was acquired] in the work environment or in his house."

He added that "the Health SEREMI is contacting the patient's family members and the people who work with him, since it is very important to determine where he was infected. The young man has been in the Hospital del Torax since yesterday [22 Nov 2018] and is in stable but serious condition."

[Although not specified in this or previous reports from the region, the hantavirus involved in this case no doubt is Andes virus. This virus is endemic in Chile, including the O'Higgins region, and cases of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occur every year. As mentioned above, this is the beginning of the summer season, when cases of hantavirus infection occur. The patient likely came into contact with areas inhabited by the rodent reservoir of the virus in the O'Higgins region. Andes hantavirus is endemic in the Andean region of Chile, and cases occur there every year.

Andes virus is rarely transmitted directly person to person, and when it is, it is only through close physical contact, usually within the family. The most common source of the infection is the long-tailed pygmy rice rat. Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_), the Sigmodontine rodent host of Andes hantavirus, can be seen at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligoryzomys_longicaudatus#/media/File:Raton_colilarga.jpg. - Mod.TY
