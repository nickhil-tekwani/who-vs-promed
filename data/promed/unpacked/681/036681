ProMED-SoAs (Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases - South Asia): an Internet-based network covering emerging infectious diseases with a focus on the South Asian countries
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ProMED-mail is delighted to announce the launch of ProMED-SoAs, an Internet-based reporting system for emerging and reemerging diseases of humans, animals, and plants.

ProMED-SoAs will follow the guiding principles and objectives of ProMED-mail, with a focus on emerging disease events occurring in the South Asian countries. It will serve to facilitate an information exchange that allows for greater discussion of topics of special interest to the region, and will promote transparency with the aim of earlier detection and reporting of outbreaks.

Because the original ProMED list is worldwide, to keep the number of postings to an acceptable level for the wide range of subscribers, we may omit reporting outbreaks of diseases considered to be endemic, but these may well be of interest to people residing in the regions where these outbreaks are occurring. For this reason, ProMED and the International Society for Infectious Diseases, in collaboration with HealthMap, TEPHINET and the Skoll Foundation Global Threats Fund, has decided to develop a service dedicated to the South Asia region. The South Asian countries of special interest presently include: Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Reports of events of interest in surrounding countries will also be covered, as the borders between countries are not impervious to disease transmission.

Posts will include direct reports from subscribers, news stories (in English as well as other languages that have been translated into English), and other Internet-based sources of information. No anonymous reports will be accepted, although if an individual subscriber requests to have their name withheld, we will honor that request.

We welcome subscribers from the region and look forward to a very fruitful and exciting collaboration.

To subscribe, please go to the ProMED-mail website at http://promedmail.org/soas and click on the "SUBSCRIBE" button at the top right, and then subscribe to the ProMED-SoAs list.

You can also follow ProMED-SoAs on Facebook and Twitter.

To submit information for posting, you can click "SUBMIT INFO" on the website or send an email to <promed-soas@promedmail.org>.
