A 48-year-old woman in California contracted a potentially deadly meningitis infection in 2016 from smoking her favorite medical marijuana strain 3 to 6 times a day, according to a British Medical Journal case study report published last month [December 2017; [1]. The infection came from a fungus, called _Cryptococcus_, that most people contract from inhaling contaminated dust or eating food that mouse feces have touched [sic, see below].

Meningitis is the most common illness to develop from exposure to _Cryptococcus_, and causes potentially fatal inflammation in the brain and spinal cord.

Dr Bryan Shapiro, who treated the woman, says that cannabis smokers in California should be sure to know where their marijuana came from, especially if their immune systems are compromised in any way, as meningitis could be lethal for them.

The unnamed woman's sister brought her to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC) in Los Angeles, California. She had 'strange symptoms,' Dr Shapiro said, including being dizzy, tired, struggling to recall even her own name, and behaving aggressively. In fact, her behavior had become so erratic that she was fired from her job as an administrative assistant before being admitted to the hospital.

At CSMC, the emergency room team could not figure out what was ailing the otherwise healthy patient. When she assaulted a nurse, the team called in the psychiatric department. 'We thought it might be catatonia [abnormal movement triggered by mental issues], and it took us some time to rule out a psychiatric illness,' Dr Shapiro said.

Still unable to diagnose her, they took a sample of her brain fluid [cerebrospinal fluid or CSF], which tested positive for _Cryptococcus neoformans_, 'a rare fungal infection usually only seen in people with late stage HIV or transplant patients,' Dr Shapiro explained.

But the woman was otherwise in reasonably good health. The only things that stood out in her medical history were high blood pressure and a significant marijuana habit. 'She said she had smoked between 3 and 6 marijuana blunts about daily since her teenage years,' Shapiro said, 'I've never known a patient who smokes that heavily and wondered if there could be a link between her heavy cannabis use for a lifetime.'

They treated the woman for meningitis, but if they hadn't done so 'prudently...there is a strong possibility she would have died, she was very, very severe at the time we saw her,' he says.

As she was recovering, Dr Shapiro and his team investigated her favorite medical marijuana dispensary in Bakersfield where she always purchased one of the shop's cheaper strains, which was grown locally outdoors. DNA sequencing of 9 samples revealed small amounts of the rare fungus. 'That lent credibility to the idea that the _Cryptococcus_ in the cannabis may have caused the woman's systemic malfunction, and smoking might actually predispose someone to invasive fungal infection,' Dr Shapiro said.

Fungus spores are actually grown on cannabis quite commonly. A study conducted last year [2017] identified evidence of mold, pesticides, and other contaminants on much of the weed grown in the state [2]. More than 90 percent of the marijuana plants tested were contaminated with pesticides, and crops from 20 farms were positive for mold.

The soil in Bakersfield and the surrounding Central Valley area is known to be a breeding ground for another fungus called _Coccidioides immitis_, which is to blame for a slew of cases of an infection, dubbed 'valley fever' [aka, coccidioidomycosis].

Valley fever is a potentially severe lung infection and its symptoms can mirror those of the flu that has killed nearly 100 people in California since the start of the year [2017 ?]. The prevalence of the valley fever fungus -- which causes infection when it is inhaled -- in the area 'raised suspicions' for Dr Shapiro and his team that the soil could harbor _Cryptococcus_ as well. The spores of these fungi are very heat resistant, so they survive even as the weed they are attached to is smoked.

Even so, it is rare for someone with an otherwise healthy immune system to get such an infection, and Dr Shapiro points to other research that has suggested that THC [tetrahydrocannabinol] -- the psychoactive component of weed -- may itself suppress the immune system. "So, the more you smoke, the greater the exposure [to the fungus and] the more likely it is that your body is unable to fight off the infection," he says.

Dr Shapiro was unable to disclose the name of the particular dispensary that the contaminated marijuana came from, but said that it is under investigation.

This case was the 1st of its kind that Dr Shapiro or his team had seen, so it's too early to make formal recommendations, he says, but advises: 'Make sure you know where your marijuana is coming from. 'I recommend buying indoor-grown strains and, for people who are immuno-compromised like those with HIV or other infections, I would recommend avoiding inhaled marijuana products,' he says. Edible products, on the other hand are probably safer for consumption.

[Cryptococcosis is a fungal disease caused by the encapsulated yeast _Cryptococcus neoformans_ or _C. gattii_. These 2 species have 5 serotypes based on antigenic specificity of the capsular polysaccharide; these include serotypes A, D, and AD (_C. neoformans_) and serotypes B and C (_C. gattii_). The ecologic niches for _C. neoformans_ and _C. gattii_ appear to be distinct. _C. gattii_ lives in the soil and areas on or around trees, such as the eucalyptus. _C. gattii_ is not associated with birds, whereas _C. neoformans_ is found in the accumulated droppings around roosting and nesting sites of birds, especially pigeons. Pigeons are not known to acquire symptomatic disease but can carry cryptococci on feathers, skin, in the crop and cloaca [common cavity into which the intestinal, genital, and urinary tracts open]. _Cryptococcus neoformans_ was the cryptococcal species isolated from the patient's cerebrospinal fluid in the above news report.

Cryptococci can become aerosolized when dried bird droppings or contaminated soil are stirred up. People can become infected when they inhale aerosolized cryptococci, which primarily infect the lung, but may subsequently spread systemically via the bloodstream, especially to the central nervous system where the organisms cause a basilar meningoencephalitis. Mice and their feces are not involved with this disease.

A University of California (UC) Davis group had previously reported that one of their immunocompromised patients developed a fungal infection after using aerosolized marijuana (https://www.eastcountymagazine.org/tainted-marijuana-kills-california-man-contaminated-plants-found-statewide). The patient had been told by the dispensary that the marijuana product, which consisted of raw, blended marijuana that was inhaled as a mist, was a safer alternative to smoking (https://www.ucdmc.ucdavis.edu/publish/news/newsroom/11791). This prompted the UC Davis group testing 20 medical marijuana samples statewide. The following is extracted from this report, which is the 2nd article referenced in the news report above [full article including references and appendices available at the URL cited]:

"20 cannabis samples from different dispensaries in northern California were collected by Steep Hill Labs, cataloged, and DNA was extracted using the PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio). The fungal communities (assessed by ITS gene sequence analysis) and the bacterial communities (from 16S sRNA gene) were analyzed using published methods. More specific whole metagenome (WMGS) analyses were used to better understand the presence of distinct species within the microbiome. ITS analysis resulted in about 4000 total fungal taxonomic classifications. Of the 20 fungal genera observed at more than 0.1 percent frequency, many are genera that contain opportunistic pathogens (such as, _Cryptococcus_ [species not specified], _Mucor_, _Aspergillus_) (Appendix 1)."

The abstract of the 1st article referenced in the news report above is extracted below:

"Cryptococcal meningitis is a life-threatening condition most commonly observed in immunocompromised individuals. We describe a daily cannabis smoker without evidence of immunodeficiency presenting with confirmed _Cryptococcus neoformans_ meningitis. An investigation of cannabis samples from the patient's preferred dispensary demonstrated contamination with several varieties of _Cryptococcus_, including _C. neoformans_, and other opportunistic fungi. These findings raise concern regarding the safety of dispensary-grade cannabis, even in immunocompetent users."

Molecular typing was apparently not done to see if the clinical isolate of _C. neoformans_ and the _C. neoformans_ identified in the marijuana obtained from the patient's dispensary matched. - Mod.ML
