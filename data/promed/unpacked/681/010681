The health minister of West Darfur announced that the 3rd phase of the vaccination campaign against yellow fever [the disease] that reportedly killed 171 people across Darfur would be launched next Tuesday [5 Mar 2013] in the state. Ishaq Ahmed Yaqoub said 200 000 people in 3 localities, namely Jebel Moon, Kulbus and Sirba, are to be vaccinated in this phase.

He is urging the state's population, especially those in the targeted 3 localities, to rush to medical centers as of Tuesday and get their shots. According to the minister, no cases of yellow fever have been reported in the state in the last 2 months.

Meanwhile, the federal health minister Bahr Idriss Abu Garda announced that 6 million people across Darfur have been vaccinated against yellow fever since the campaign started last November [2012].

Approximately 7.5 million people live in Darfur, according to the last census in 2010.

He further announced the complete eradication of the disease in the region, adding no one has been diagnosed with it for the last 3 months.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that over 840 people were infected with yellow fever in Darfur and that the epidemic affected 35 out of 64 localities in the region since September last year.

Official statistics suggest Central Darfur was the worst hit state with 51.5 per cent of the registered cases of yellow fever. It was followed by North Darfur (21 per cent), West Darfur (17.4 per cent) and South Darfur (9.5 per cent). East Darfur was the least affected province.

[It has taken a bit longer to launch the 3rd phase of the vaccination campaign than was earlier announced. Fortunately, there have been no new cases reported in Darfur recently. Since this area is difficult to access on the ground, and Darfur in general is torn by armed conflict, there is a risk that infected individuals may not be able to come to the relative few health care centers and, hence, are not reported. Given these circumstances, the 3rd phase of the vaccination campaign is prudent. One hopes that this yellow fever outbreak, the worst in Africa in the last 20 years, is now well and truly over.
