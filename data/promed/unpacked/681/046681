Palani Hills may lose unique banana varieties to virus
------------------------------------------------------
The delicately flavoured bananas grown in the Palani Hills in Tamil Nadu,
traditionally used at the renowned Subramanya temple, may be wiped out by a
viral disease. The condition known as "bunchy top" prevents the plant from
fruiting. Farmers are placing colourful sticky traps that attract the
aphids that spread the virus, said V Arasu, secretary of the TN Hill Banana
Growers Federation.

Two varieties that are native to the area were conferred geographical
indication status [GI; a protected name or sign for products corresponding
to a specific geographical origin - Mod.DHA] giving them recognition as
bearing special characteristics. Both are grown by about 280 farmers as an
intercrop across 8000 ha [about 20 000 acres] of coffee estates. 3 decades
ago, the area was about 5 times as much, said a coffee planter. "It will
shrink further since the disease is spreading," he said.

Temple authorities traditionally collected the fruit but have now turned to
fruit grown in Karnataka. The traders have also stopped. Around 40-50 kg
[88-110 lb] of bananas used to be collected over a week but that has now
been discontinued because of the toll the virus has taken on the fruit.

The bananas raised in the coffee plantations provide shade to the coffee
plants as well as a steady income to the farmers. The strength of the
coffee market has made farmers complacent about the spreading virus.
"Though there is a general awareness of the severity of the disease, the
price that coffee fetches makes growers ignore it. Fortunately, the virus
does not affect the coffee plants" said Arasu.

The virus has affected almost 35 per cent of the plants across the area,
said M Anandan, Tamil Nadu Agriculture University. Even the disease-free
tissue culture plants that come at nearly INR 2 [USD 0.04] higher than the
side suckers, are not disease tolerant, he added.

[_Banana bunchy top virus_ (BBTV) is the only member of the genus
_Babuvirus_ and only affects _Musa_ species. It causes one of the most
serious diseases of banana with symptoms of chlorosis, stunting, and death
of the host plant. The virus is spreading in Africa, Australasia, and the
Pacific Islands. BBTV is transmitted by the banana aphid _Pentalonia
nigronervosa_ in a persistent manner. Infectious insects may be spread on
plant material. The virus is also spread with infected suckers but cannot
be transmitted by mechanical means (such as cutting tools).

Disease management is extremely difficult and includes vector control
(including capture by sticky traps, as mentioned above), removal of
inoculum, use of clean planting material, and frequent scouting for new
outbreaks. Eradication of established BBTV from a planting is usually
impossible. Tolerant varieties can be used to enable some crop production
in infected areas, but these cultivars may still support virus replication
and thus serve as pathogen reservoirs.

For the BBTV affected hills area in Tamil Nadu the available tolerant
varieties may not be suitable, and in any case the special local GI
varieties would still be lost. Tissue culture, as mentioned above, is used
widely to propagate planting material free of fungi and bacteria, but
plantlets still need to be tested for the presence of viruses since they
are not eliminated by this technique alone.
