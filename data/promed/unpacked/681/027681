On [16 Jun 2016] the National IHR Focal Point of United Arab Emirates (UAE) reported one additional case of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the case
-------------------
A 37-year-old, non-national, male, living in Abu Dhabi Emirate. He developed symptoms on [9 Jun 2016], and was admitted to hospital on [11 Jun 2016]. The case, who has no comorbidities, tested positive for MERS-CoV on [16 Jun 2016]. Investigation of history of exposure to the known risk factors in the 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms is ongoing. The patient is currently in critical condition, admitted to the ICU on mechanical ventilation. Investigation of household contacts, co-workers and healthcare contacts are ongoing.

Globally, since September 2012, WHO has been notified of 1762 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including at least 629 related deaths.

[From the above report, there was probably simultaneous release of the HAAD announcement together with this WHO update. Since the beginning of June 2016 there has been the increase in confirmation of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia (see prior ProMED-mail reports below in the see also section as well as sections [3] and [4] of this current update), a case in Qatar with a history of travel to Saudi Arabia in the 14 days preceding onset of illness and now this case in the UAE. In April and May 2016 there were reports of confirmed cases from Qatar and Bahrain. The case in Bahrain was imported from Saudi Arabia, and the case in Qatar was a camel worker.

According to the most recent ECDC global update on MERS-CoV in the week 23 Communicable Disease Threats Report, up through 11 Jun 2016 there had been 83 confirmed MERS-CoV infected individuals in the UAE including 12 deaths (see http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications/Publications/Communicable-disease-threats-report-11-june-2016.pdf for the full report). With the addition of this newly confirmed case it will raise to 84 the total number of confirmed cases reported by the UAE since April 2012.

We await further information on the epidemiologic investigation of this current case in the UAE, especially possible high risk exposures including contact with other known or suspected cases, travel history and possible contact with camels. - Mod.MPP]

http://www.moh.gov.sa/en/CCC/PressReleases/Pages/statistics-2016-06-21-001.aspx


As of 13:00 [1 PM] today [21 Jun 2016] there have been a total of:
1418 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including
594 deaths [reported case fatality rate 41.9 percent]
790 recoveries, and
34 currently active cases [including 20 asymptomatic infections]

In the past 24 hours there have been:
2 newly confirmed cases
0 newly reported fatalities, and
0 newly reported recoveries

Information on newly reported cases:
1- A 66 year old Saudi male from Jeddah, non-HCW, currently in critical condition. Classified as a primary case under investigation for contact with camels in the 14 days preceding onset of illness.

2- A 57 year old Saudi female from Jeddah, non-HCW, currently in stable condition. Classified as a 2dary case in a household contact.

[These are the 1st 2 newly confirmed cases reported from Jeddah since 9 Mar 2016 when a newly confirmed fatal case was reported. As 1 of these cases was classified as a primary case, it suggests that there was no known contact of this case with other known MERS-CoV infected individuals, although history of camel exposure is still under investigation. We await further information on this case as it becomes available. The 2nd case reported from Jeddah is a 2ary household contact, presumably of the 1st case.

Between 16 and 18 Jun 2016, the National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia notified WHO of 22 additional cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV).

A MERS-CoV outbreak is currently ongoing in a hospital in Riyadh city, Riyadh region. The index case for this outbreak is the 49 year-old female reported to WHO on 15 Jun 2016 (see DON posted 19 Jun 2016, case no.1). The case has co-morbidities. On 10 Jun 2016 she was admitted to the hospital with unrelated symptoms. She was triaged in the Emergency Department for her illness. She was then admitted to the vascular surgery ward - MERS-CoV infection was not considered. She was not isolated and was managed in a multi-bed room. During this time, more than 49 HCWs [health care workers], and patients were exposed.

After she was confirmed as a MERS-CoV case, a Rapid Response Team was dispatched and extensive contract tracing was initiated. Twenty (20) of those screened so far at the hospital and in the household have tested positive for MERS-CoV. These are seventeen (17) healthcare contacts and three (3) household contacts. Eighteen (18) of the twenty (20) are asymptomatic.

The vascular surgery ward was closed and elective procedures were rescheduled. The necessary control measures are being put in place.

[The above WHO update helps to clarify the current situation in Saudi Arabia, providing detailed information on MERS-CoV infections reported by the Saudi MOH during the period 16-18 Jun 2016. It confirms that the index case was the 49 year old Saudi female reported as a newly confirmed case on 15 Jun 2016 and reported as a fatality yesterday (20 Jun 2016). From the above provided information, the index case was hospitalized to the vascular surgery ward (after spending some time in the emergency room) initially for presumed unrelated symptoms. She was confirmed as MERS-CoV infected on 12 Jun 2016 (information from the WHO update on 19 Jun 2016: "A 49-year-old female from Buraidah city developed symptoms on 9 Jun 2016 and was admitted to a hospital on 10 Jun 2016. She tested positive for MERS-CoV on 12 Jun 2016." see prior ProMED update MERS-CoV (68): Saudi Arabia (RI, NJ) WHO 20160619.4296553). As she was from Buraidah city, one wonders if she had received medical care in Buraidah before presenting to the hospital in Riyadh (remembering there had been a nosocomial outbreak in Buraidah in March 2016).

Of the 22 newly confirmed infections reported to WHO during this period, cases 6, 7 and 11 are the only 3 symptomatic infections newly reported in the above WHO update. The remaining 19 newly confirmed cases are asymptomatic infections. 5 of the asymptomatic infected individuals were patients admitted to the hospital for other reasons, 3 were in household contacts of the index case, and 1 was an unspecified contact of the index case. As the 5 asymptomatic infected individuals all had pre-existing co-morbidities, they may be at higher risk of severe clinical manifestations. According to the above report, there were 49 identified contacts, and thus far, 20 have tested positive for MERS-CoV infection and are asymptomatic, and an additional 4 have been reported as in stable condition bringing the total proportion of infected contacts to 49.0 percent (see MERS-CoV (68): Saudi Arabia (RI, NJ) WHO 20160619.4296553 and MERS-CoV (65): Saudi Arabia, RFI 20160617.4294117 for details).
