Rabid cat put down in Maine
------------------------------------
State health officials say members of a western Maine family who were
bitten by a rabid kitten are being treated. The family dog, which was
also bitten, is getting a rabies booster.

Officials say a stray kitten that was taken in by the Oxford County
family in late August [2009] was found to be rabid earlier this month
after testing at the state's health laboratory. The kitten had bitten
3 family members and their dog. The kitten has been euthanized.

The 3 individuals bitten by the cat will receive treatment over the
next 28 days. The dog was current on its rabies vaccination, and will
be placed in a 45-day quarantine.

So far this year, a total of 42 rabid animals have been identified in
Maine. That includes 22 raccoons, 10 skunks, six foxes, 3 bats and one cat.
