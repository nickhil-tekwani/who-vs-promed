IRRADIATION OF FOODSTUFFS: A SUGGESTION (02)

Education of the [American] public about food irradiation is a worthy goal,
but unlikely to succeed. American public ignorance on science is invincible.
With folks like [name of organization omitted by Moderator] carrying out
their usual rituals, aided by tax exemption, mere truth doesn't have a chance.
Keep in mind that the medical radiology community, in the greatest display of
scientific capitulation since Galileo, renamed Nuclear Magnetic Resonance as
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) because they were afraid of the nuke word.
The only thing more difficult to achieve than the acceptance of food
irradiation would be hand washing.

[Whether irradiation is or is not helpful and safe are scientific questions.
Whether irradiation will be accepted is a political question. When the cost
(however one measures that cost) of irradiated food becomes lower than the
cost of non-irradiated food, it will become law. I suppose we will receive
more messages on this subject but we will not allow this string to continue
for long. It won't be helpful. -- Mod CHC]
