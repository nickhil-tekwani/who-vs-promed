Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data show a 15 percent increase in the number of syphilis infections from 2013 to 2014 alone. Two new studies presented at the 2016 STD [sexually transmitted diseases] Prevention Conference suggest that syphilis is taking a particularly severe toll on gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM), especially in the south.

These studies underscore the critical importance of syphilis screening and care for gay and bisexual men. Prompt diagnosis and complete antibiotic treatment is essential to cure syphilis infections, prevent long-term health complications, and stop the spread of infection.

For the 1st time, CDC researchers have calculated the state-level primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis rates among MSM. The rates were developed using preliminary 2015 national syphilis case report data and 2014 population estimates of the number of adult MSM by state.

Researchers developed rates for the 44 states that reported the sex of partners for at least 70 percent of the men diagnosed with P&S syphilis in 2015. Estimates of syphilis rates among MSM vary from 73.1 per 100 000 in Alaska to 748.3 in North Carolina. The state data show syphilis disproportionately affects MSM in the south and the west, with 4 of the 5 states with the highest rates of P&S among MSM located in the south: North Carolina (748.3 per 100 000), Mississippi (658.9 per 100 000), Louisiana (601.8 per 100 000) and South Carolina (536.9 per 100 000). Nationally, the data show the estimated P&S syphilis rate among MSM is 309 cases per 100 000.

CDC data show significant increase in syphilis screening among MSM. Using National HIV Behavioral Surveillance data from 2008, 2011, and 2014, researchers assessed syphilis testing and diagnoses trends among MSM in 20 U.S. cities. In 2014, nearly half (49 percent) of MSM reported that they had been screened for syphilis within the previous 12 months, up from 37 percent in 2008. Among those screened, the percentage who reported testing positive increased from 9 percent to 11 percent. The findings suggest that providers are increasingly aware of the risk and need for annual screening for syphilis among MSM, but rates are still low among MSM at high risk for the disease.

Screening was most common among MSM at highest risk, including those who were HIV-positive (68 percent) and those with more than 10 sexual partners in the past 12 months (65 percent). Diagnoses increases were greatest among MSM who were black (9 percent to 14 percent), HIV-positive (15 percent to 21 percent), and those with 10 or more sexual partners (11 percent to 17 percent).

[Primary and secondary (P&S) syphilis are the most infectious stages of the disease, and if not adequately treated, can lead to long-term infection and place a person at increased risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection. The number of cases of P&S syphilis in the U.S. in men who have sex with men (MSM) has doubled in the past 7 years, going from about 4000 in 2007 to over 8000 in 2014, while the numbers of cases in men who have sex with women (MSW) and in women have remained stable during this period of time (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/figures/32.htm). Nationally, the rate of P&S syphilis per 100 000 people in 2014 was 6.3, which represent a 15.1% increase since 2013. Nationally, the rate in 2014 in women was 1.1 and in men, 11.7, and the male to female sex ratio was 10.6 (http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/tables/29.htm, https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/figures/33.htm).

While rates have increased among both men and women between 2013 and 2014, men account for more than 90 percent of all P&S syphilis cases, and MSM account for 83 percent of male cases where the sex of the sex partner is known (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/std-trends-508.pdf). Available surveillance data indicate that an average of half of MSM who have syphilis are also infected with HIV (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats14/std-trends-508.pdf).

The news report above says that from preliminary 2015 national syphilis case report data, the estimated rate of P&S syphilis in MSM varied from 73.1 per 100 000 in Alaska to 748.3 in North Carolina, at least 6.2-fold higher than the overall rate in men in 2014.

The CDC recommends that sexually active MSM should have tests for syphilis, chlamydia, gonorrhea, and HIV at least once a year, with more frequent STD testing for men at high risk. The above news report says that the CDC data show a significant increase in syphilis screening for syphilis among MSM, which likely contributes in part to the increasing rates of P&S syphilis in MSM. - Mod.ML]
