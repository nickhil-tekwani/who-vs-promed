An 8 year old boy died from bird flu [avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection] in a Bali hospital on Tuesday night [24 Apr 2012]. The boy was in critical condition when he was transferred from Bangli Hospital to Sanglah Hospital on Tuesday afternoon and he was immediately isolated. "Clinically, and supported by the VCR (visual convention reaction) laboratory result, the victim was positively infected with the H5N1 virus," said Sanglah Hospital spokesman Ida Bagus Ken Wirasandi on Wednesday [25 Apr 2012].

The boy died at 10:15 pm after 4 hours at the hospital. Ken said the boy's family told him the victim had been in contact with dead poultry 2 months ago. The Bali Health Agency head Ketut Suarjaya said that 7 people on Bali have died since the virus first reached the island in 2007. "In 2011, 46 patients were suspected to have avian flu [in Bali]," Suarjaya said.

[The death of this child is reported to have been confirmed as the result of avian influenza A/(H5N1) virus infection. If confirmed officially this will become the 189th case in Indonesia, and the 157th fatality, since the onset of the outbreak in 2005. The reliability of the diagnose is uncertain, however, since the exposure of the child to dead poultry was 2 months prior to his death. Furthermore there have been 46 suspected cases in Bali during 2011, but only 7 officially confirmed deaths overall [and only one by WHO this year].
