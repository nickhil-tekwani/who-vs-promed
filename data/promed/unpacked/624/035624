The 1st Vietnamese victim of the A/H5N1 avian flu has been identified as a person born in 1954, in Tan Long village, Thanh Binh district, Dong Thap province. Dong Thap Department of Health Vice Director Doan Tuan Buu said the patient was admitted to hospital suffering a high fever on 22 Jan 2014. She was transferred to An Giang Province General Hospital on 27 Jan 2014 but died on 28 Jan 2014. Her blood tested positive for A/H5N1. She recalled having contact with poultry before falling ill.

After receiving the official blood test result, conducted by HCM City's Pasteur Institute, provincial medical and veterinary authorities immediately implemented quarantine measures to contain any contamination. The Pasteur Institute began coordinating with local authorities on 30 Jan 2014 to ensure the disease spreads no further.

[Of the 648 human cases of avian A/H5N1 influenza virus infection recorded world-wide up to the end of 2013, a total of 125 were recorded in Viet Nam. Of these 125, a total of 112 were recorded in the year 2003 (see: http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/EN_GIP_20131210CumulativeNumberH5N1cases.pdf?ua=1). Since that time, there have only been sporadic cases of H5N1 virus infection in Viet Nam; therefore, it is too early to conclude that the above case in 2014 is the harbinger of a new outbreak.

The above case is identified as the 1st in 2014, but in fact, the 1st death attributed to H5N1 bird flu in Viet Nam in 2014 occurred in southern Binh Phuc province. This was announced by the country's Department of Preventive Medicine of the Ministry of Health on 20 Jan 2014. The victim, a man aged 52, was hospitalized on 11 Jan 2014 due to symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. He died on 18 Jan 2014, the 1st death in Viet Nam in 2014, 9 months after the most recent previous case.
