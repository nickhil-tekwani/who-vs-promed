2000/046C - Pepper mild tigre begomovirus
-----------------------------------------
Why: Pepper mild tigre begomovirus came to our attention as causing an
emerging disease of capsicum and tomato in the Americas. It was first
described by Brown et al. (1989) on capsicum from Mexico.
Where: Mexico (Sinaloa, Tamaulipas), USA (Texas).
On which plants: _Capsicum annuum_ (cvs Jalapeno and Serrano). Tomato
(_Lycopersicon esculentum_).
Damage: On capsicum, mild interveinal chlorosis, veinal distortion and mild
stunting. On tomato, leaf curling, mild interveinal chlorosis and moderate
stunting.
Transmission: Transmitted by _Bemisia tabaci_.
Pathway: Infected capsicum and tomato plants, fruits?, viruliferous _B.
tabaci_ from countries where pepper mild tigre begomovirus occurs.
Possible risks: Tomato and capsicum are important crops in the EPPO region,
both indoor and outdoor. The vector is present in many parts of the EPPO
region. Data is lacking on disease severity and extent. Very little data is
available in the literature.
