China has found 3 new African swine fever [ASF] cases on small pig farms in Shanxi, Hunan, and Yunnan provinces, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said. The herds at the affected farms together total 390 pigs, the ministry said on its website.

Beijing has not yet said how the disease 1st entered the country, but the ministry found 62 percent of the 1st 21 outbreaks were related to the feeding of kitchen waste, a statement published on its website said.

The outbreak of ASF in China could lead to increased exports for Irish pigmeat to the country in the medium term, director of Meat Industry Ireland (MII) Cormac Healy has said. "In the short term, it could lead to more domestic product coming onto the market, which would dampen import demand. That said, restrictions on movement of pigs within China could lead to some regional shortages. However, in the medium term, as we move into next year [2019], if significant culling within the domestic Chinese pig herd takes place, then it should create greater import opportunities."

[The 3 new ASF outbreaks mentioned above, all affecting backyard pig holdings, were reported by China to the OIE on Wed 31 Oct 2018.
- The report on the outbreak in the Nitun village, Shanxi, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=28476.
- The report on the outbreak in the Gaoping village, Hunan, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapFullEventReport&reportid=28467.
- The report on the outbreak in the Guanfang village, Yunnan, is available, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?page_refer=MapEventSummary&reportid=28466.

The most concerning event is the 3rd outbreak mentioned above. It reportedly took place in the village Guanfang, Liushun township, Simao district, Pu'er city, Yunnan province (map at https://tinyurl.com/yd5zlqqe). This is a significant leap of ASF into China's southwest: Guanfang is 110 km [68.3 mi] distant from China's border with Myanmar, 120 km [74.6 mi] from the border with Laos, and about 280 km [174 mi] from northern Thailand (with which China does not share a common border). - Mod.AS]

A package of Chinese crispy sausage apparently carried by passengers on a ferry from China's Fujian province to Kinmen was contaminated with African swine fever (ASF) virus, the Council of Agriculture deputy minister Huang Chin-cheng said on Wednesday [31 Oct 2018].

The sausage, made by WH Group, the largest meat producer in China, was discovered on Thursday last week [25 Oct 2018] in a garbage can at Shuitou Port, Huang said. It had apparently been discarded by whoever brought it and was sent for testing to the Animal Health Research Institute as part of the government's effort to keep the ASF virus out of Taiwan.

According to Huang, pork and pork products from WH Group have been repeatedly found to contain the ASF virus since the disease was 1st reported in China on 3 Aug 2018. The disease has since spread to 13 provinces, cities, and territories in China.

The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine on 27 Aug 2018 stepped up quarantine checks at seaports and airports to prevent the disease from entering Taiwan.

There is no cure for ASF.

Out of 690 items examined since the quarantine checks were increased, the suspect sausage package was the 1st time ASF has been found in a meat product brought into the nation by travelers, bureau director-general Feng Hai-tung said.

People caught smuggling meat products from countries and areas affected by ASF or by foot-and-mouth disease can face a fine of up to TWD 15 000 [USD 490], although a bill before the legislature seeks to increase the fine to TWD 300 000 [USD 9800], Huang said.

[According to Epoch Times (an American-Chinese, New York-based news website) on Fri 2 Nov 2018, the ASF-contaminated sausage that was discarded at the Golden Gate Pier and found by the Taiwanese laboratory to be ASF-contaminated was "Shuanghui crispy intestine" produced by the largest meat processing plant in the mainland (see http://www.epochtimes.com/gb/18/11/1/n10824569.htm; in Chinese, machine trans.).

The item further says that the Beijing News reported as early as 1 Aug 2018 that a farmer in Shenyang city, Liaoning province, found 47 deaths in nearly 400 pigs on his farm. Soon, the epidemic was confirmed as African swine fever. On 14 Aug 2018, Shuanghui Development responded to investors in the roadshow hall, saying that the ASF had little effect on the company's production and operation. On the same day, several trucks carrying pigs from Shuanghui Group went from Heilongjiang to Henan, and pigs began to die in the car. In the early morning of 16 Aug 2018, the China Center for Animal Health and Epidemiology confirmed that 30 pigs that died in trucks were suffering from African swine fever. Shortly afterwards, Shuanghui Development's subsidiary in Zhengzhou urgently set up a special agency to handle the matter. Just after Shuanghui Development announced its 3rd quarterly report on 31 Oct 2018, it was released that its products contained ASF virus.

The report said that in just less than 3 months, the market value of Henan Shuanghui Investment Development Co., Ltd. suffered losses of more than CNY 10 billion [USD 1.45 billion].

If the above information is correct, ASF contamination in widely distributed pork products could have been behind many outbreaks, illuminating the route the virus may have undergone from infected farms to consumers and from their kitchens/waste/garbage to swill and to backyard pig farms. Results of the investigations, if and when published, will hopefully help in understanding the epidemiology of this striking epizootic. - Mod.AS]

The spread of African swine fever is growing in China. The epidemic has spread in the mainland or has been out of control. According to the official announcement of the Chinese Communist Party, since the start of the epidemic on 1 Aug 2018, ASF has spread to nearly half of China's provinces.

On 28 Oct 2018, 2 days before the release of the recent official information addressing new outbreaks (30 Oct 2018), some netizens posted a video on Twitter, saying that "the food market in Furong township, Jishou, Hunan [map at https://tinyurl.com/y9ozflfl] has no pork sold!" The video showed that, at a large farmers' market, stalls that were selling vegetables and non-staple foods were full, while stalls selling pork were all empty. People in the video said that the sale of pork was discontinued 2 days earlier. Pork could be purchased in houses, not in the market.

The Epoch reporter called Furong town on Tue 30 Oct 2018 and was told about sickness in pigs. Furong town was not mentioned as an ASF-affected location in the official published report.

[Fortunately, no ASF cases in wild boar have been reported in China so far. Otherwise, the situation is rather overcast.

The Chinese government set a 3 km [1.9 mi] epidemic zone and a 10 km [6.2 mi] buffer zone around each ASF recorded outbreak. Within a province, movement of live pigs from the county/city/province where ASF occurred is suspended; live pig markets in infected provinces and adjacent provinces are closed; movement of live pigs and pork products from provinces with more than 2 infected cities is prohibited; transport of live pigs from provinces adjacent to ASF-affected areas are suspended. Breeding pigs can be transported from provinces that include an epidemic zone only if accompanied by a laboratory ASF test certificate, but it is not allowed to pass through provinces with epidemic zone when transporting live pigs.

The government has been strengthening transport of pork meat rather than of live pigs. Studies showed that 62 percent of the 1st 21 ASF events in China were related to swill feeding. A nationwide ban on swill feeding to pigs, and obligatory recordkeeping of animal transportations in vehicles, has been implemented. On 30 Oct 2018, MoARA launched a 3-month investigation campaign against illegal slaughter.

In view of the situation in China, the FAO convened an emergency regional consultation on ASF entitled "risk reduction and preparedness." This meeting was held in Bangkok on 5-7 Sep 2018 and attended by a total of 87 participants, including the representatives of Animal Health Authorities from Cambodia, China, Japan, Lao PDR, Mongolia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Republic of Korea, Thailand, and Viet Nam. Also attending were private-sector stakeholders from the pig production industry, research institutes and academia from the region and the European Union, development partners, the OIE, and, obviously, the FAO.

The meeting was organized to allow sharing of experiences from Europe and China; identify gaps on risk reduction based on perceived risks of ASF introduction to the countries; preliminarily assess countries' preparedness for ASF; and develop a collaborative framework based on priority actions identified by countries.

Some interesting pieces of information discussed are as follows:

1. Based on the European experience, currently recommended active surveillance sampling strategies (based on 95 percent probability of detecting at least one infected pig, assuming a prevalence of 5 percent in the population) were inappropriate for early detection and led to a false sense of security, since they are not sufficiently sensitive to detecting infection soon after introduction.

2. Expectedly, there was a drop in domestic pig prices in affected provinces following the ASF outbreaks. Moreover, there is an observed higher price variability between ASF-affected and non-affected provinces after the outbreak compared to a narrow pig price variability across provinces prior to the outbreak.

3. A company affected by ASF showed a one-day, 12 percent drop in share prices when ASF struck its slaughterhouse in Zhengzhou province, the biggest share price drop for the company since October 2014 (see item 2 above and its commentary). Recent pronouncements from market analysts seem to indicate that the Chinese stock market has not fully considered the potential severity and economic impact of ASF to affected industries.

4. Various preliminary estimates on the potential economic impact of ASF for 10 countries in the Asian region attending the meeting were presented based on 6 different scenarios of the ASFV spread, case fatality, and various mortality costs models. The estimated collective economic cost of ASF for the 10 countries, based on mortality, ranged from USD 2.1 billion [about CNY 14.5 billion] to USD 62 billion [about CNY 427.2 billion]. However, it was highlighted that such estimates were constructed based on parameters relevant to other regions and focused on mortality costs. This limits the accuracy of such estimates and imposes a large uncertainty.

5. Aside from mortality costs from ASF, the economic impact from animal movement restrictions may be harder for businesses to plan for and estimate. In addition, participants noted that the whole pig venture capital will be affected by ASF, including associated industries such as animal feeds. For instance, depopulation of pigs might impact the demand for animal feed. The latter could also be a potential transmission avenue of ASFV, and implementing more stringent biosecurity measures on feed production and transport may be costly for the industry.

6. The economic cost of compensation (in countries where it is practiced) was identified as a key challenge, especially in a widespread epizootic situation. Even when a compensation policy is in place, another challenge is how to incentivize farmers to report suspected cases immediately. Low or delayed compensation from the destruction of animals could have the same effect on farmers' behavior as having no compensation at all (i.e., weak disease reporting by farmers). The AI experience in Asia on compensation could provide some insights on how smallholder farmers could react to a stamping-out policy for ASF. A proportionality principle could also be considered for compensation wherein greater compensation could be provided to backyard farms and less to big commercial farmers given their resources and capacities.

In late October [2018], Thai media published several news items addressing ASF risk in south Thailand due to the smuggling of wild boars via the shared border with Malaysia (see http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/national/30357278). We are not aware of ASF in Malaysia. ProMED-mail is indebted to Dr Sam Hamilton for bringing the said reports to our attention. - Mod.AS
