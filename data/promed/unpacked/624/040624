MENINGOCOCCAL VACCINE: REQUEST FOR INFO
=======================================
Date: Wed, 14 May 1997 18:20:07 +0200 (METDST)
From: Javier Garcia Leon <jgarcia@cica.es>

The vaccine for meningococcal disease (A+C) is recommended for outbreak
control, but I would like to now if there is any country where this
vaccine has been recommended for all the country population from 2 to 19
years old?
What was the incidence rate in this case?
