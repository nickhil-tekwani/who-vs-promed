[For the above and additional background information, including diagnostic methods, please refer to the OIE Terrestrial Manual 2015, Chapter 2.3.14 "Newcastle disease" at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.14_NEWCASTLE_DIS.pdf from which the following commentary is quoted:

"Newcastle disease (ND) is caused by virulent strains of avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1) serotype of the genus Avulavirus belonging to the subfamily Paramyxovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae. The paramyxoviruses isolated from avian species have been classified by serological testing and phylogenetic analysis into ten subtypes designated APMV-1 to APMV-10; ND virus (NDV) has been designated APMV-1.

One of the most characteristic properties of different strains of NDV has been their great variation in pathogenicity for chickens. Strains of NDV have been grouped into 5 pathotypes on the basis of the clinical signs seen in infected chickens. These are:
1. Viscerotropic velogenic: a highly pathogenic form in which haemorrhagic intestinal lesions are frequently seen;
2. Neurotropic velogenic: a form that presents with high mortality, usually following respiratory and nervous signs;
3. Mesogenic: a form that presents with respiratory signs, occasional nervous signs, but low mortality;
4. Lentogenic or respiratory: a form that presents with mild or subclinical respiratory infection;
5. Asymptomatic: a form that usually consists of a subclinical enteric infection.

NDV is a human pathogen and the most common sign of infection in humans is conjunctivitis that develops within 24 hours of NDV exposure to the eye. Reported infections have been non-life threatening and usually not debilitating for more than a day or 2. The most frequently reported and best-substantiated clinical signs in human infections have been eye infections, usually consisting of unilateral or bilateral reddening, excessive lachrymation [flow of tears], oedema [excess fluid] of the eyelids, conjunctivitis and sub-conjunctival haemorrhage. Although the effect on the eye may be quite severe, infections are usually transient and the cornea is not affected. There is no evidence of human-to-human spread."
