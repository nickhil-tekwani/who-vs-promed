After being declared measles-free in 2014, measles is back in very large numbers in Mongolia in 2016, prompting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue a travel notice for travelers to the East Asian country.

Mongolia reported no confirmed measles cases in 2012, 2013 and 2014. In 2015, they reported more than 1600 confirmed cases, just a year after being declared measles free.

The CDC reported last week that the measles outbreak in Mongolia has reached more than 19 000 cases nationwide and 59 infant deaths. Most of the infected have been students and infants. The capital city of Ulaanbaatar is most seriously hit.

CDC recommends that travelers to Mongolia protect themselves by making sure they are vaccinated against measles, particularly infants 6-11 months of age (one dose of measles vaccine) and children 12 months of age or older (2 doses of measles vaccine). Clinicians should keep measles in mind when treating patients with fever and rash, especially if the patient has recently traveled internationally.

[The outbreak continues to grow in Mongolia in 2016 since re-appearing in 2015, after having been absent for 3 years. See ProMED-mail post Measles update (15): Mongolia 20160513.4220074. One has to wonder whether declaration of being measles-free in 2014 led to people stopping vaccinating their children. - Mod.LK

The Pahang Health Department has confirmed that the incidence of measles in the state has risen.

Its director, Datuk Dr Zainal Ariffin Omar, said that there had been 29 cases as of 24 Jun 2016 compared to only 2 cases in the same period last year [2015].

"The cases involved patients aged between 3 months and 37 years, and 38 per cent were those who should get immunisation but were not administered the measles vaccine," he told Bernama here today [25 Jun 2016].

Although immunisation coverage in the state had reached the target, there were still parents or guardians who would not allow their children to be vaccinated, he said. "In 2014, there were 84 reported cases of immunisation rejection, and the number rose to 126 in 2015, and 88 as at May this year [2016]."

Dr Zainal Ariffin attributed the rejection to doubts about the content of the vaccine, preference for homeopathy, and persuasion by family members and friends. "This rejection phenomenon by parents and guardians will only endanger the lives of their children and [create] a source for the infectious disease to spread," he said.

In Perak, 102 cases of rejection by parents for vaccination for their children were recorded between January and May this year [2016], compared to 145 throughout 2015.

State Health, Transport, Non-Muslim Affairs, National Integration and New Villages Committee chairman Datuk Dr Mah Hang Soon said of the number, 100 were by Malay families and the rest, other races.

"Parents should not be influenced by rumours that children would become disabled if they receive the vaccination, as this rarely occurs," he told Bernama after a motivation workshop for teachers and students at Batang Padang here.

Perak Health director Datuk Dr Juwita Ghazali urged parents not to doubt or be anxious about the status of the vaccines, as the Health Ministry had certified them as halal.

Meanwhile in George Town, state Agriculture and Agro-based Industry, Rural Development and Health Committee chairman Dr Afif Bahardin said Penang has not recorded any cases of diphtheria. Nevertheless, he said, the committee had already identified the parents who were "anti-vaccine" by not letting their children receive immunisation prepared by the Health Ministry.

"The state health department had earlier on carried out awareness campaigns on the vaccination," he told reporters after the launch of the automated external defibrillator by Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng at Bukit Bendera here.
