The national head of Epidemiology at the Ministry of Health [editor's note: Ministry of Health in Spanish is Ministerio de Salud (often abbreviated as MINSA)], Leonardo Labrador, mentioned that malaria cases showed an increase at the beginning of the year [2021]. However, at present, the situation is limited mainly to endemic areas, such as Guna Yala [Indigenous Region, northeast Atlantic coast], Darien [Province, eastern], and Eastern Panama [part of the province of Panama, which includes the capital, Panama City].

Labrador stated that 1506 cases of malaria have been reported through epidemiological week number 21. Of that total, Eastern Panama has the highest number of cases with 888, followed by Guna Yala with 344, and Darien with 193.

The other cases are distributed throughout the rest of the country, with 68 cases in Ngabe Bugle [Indigenous Region, western], 5 in Metro Panama [Panama City metro area], 3 each in Northern and Western Panama [Northern Panama is part of the province of Panama; Western Panama is a separate province], and only 1 case each in the provinces of Chiriqui and Veraguas [provinces, western], based on information provided by the statistics section of the Epidemiology department.

The Ministry of Health reiterates that malaria is an infectious disease produced by a parasite called _Plasmodium_ and transmitted by the female _Anopheles_ mosquito.

[A total of 1506 cases of malaria so far in 2021 is an increase compared to previous years. According to the WHO World Malaria Report 2020 (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240015791; Annex 3-F. Population Denominator for Case Incidence and Mortality Rate, and Estimated Malaria Cases and Deaths, 2000-2019), Panama reported 5365 malaria cases in 2004, declining to 1349 in 2007 and 783 in 2008. The reported numbers were stable between 700 and 800 annual cases up to 2018 (786 cases) and then started to increase, with 1578 cases reported in 2019. Thus, over the past 2 years, there has been an increase in malaria, and the numbers reported here indicate that Panama may pass 3000 cases in 2021. - Mod.EP
