[1] South Africa: beta variant
Date: Mon 12 Jul 2021

Case incidence, hospital admissions, and in-hospital mortality all increased during the 2nd wave of COVID-19 in South Africa, when the beta variant (B.1.351) was predominant, researchers found in a prospective cohort study.

Cases were up dramatically in the 2nd wave compared with the 1st wave (240.4 per 100 000 people vs 136 per 100 000, respectively), as were hospital admissions (27.9 per 100 000 vs 16.1 per 100,000) and deaths (8.3 per 100 000 vs 3.6 per 100 000), reported Waasila Jassat, MD, from the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in Johannesburg, South Africa and colleagues.

Moreover, a multivariable analysis of the 2nd wave showed a 31% increased risk of in-hospital death (adjusted OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.28-1.35), the authors wrote in Lancet Global Health (https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00289-8). "We found increased mortality in the 2nd wave, partly explained by more admissions in older individuals and in the public sector, and by higher volumes of hospital admissions," Jassat and colleagues stated.

Higher mortality was especially prevalent in weeks when hospital capacity was stretched, she told MedPage Today separately.

The UK reported higher hospitalizations and deaths due to the alpha variant (B.1.1.7), but little has been known about the virulence of the newer beta variant, first identified in South Africa in September 2020. Derived from mutations, the beta variant houses a few inside its receptor binding domain, shown to exert more strength in binding to the human cell receptor, ACE2, increasing transmission risk more than other variants, the authors said.

"Hospital overcrowding at the height of a COVID-19 surge is an important cause of increased mortality," Linda-Gail Bekker, PhD, and Ntobeko AB Ntusi, MD, both from the University of Cape Town in South Africa stated in an accompanying editorial. "Therefore, a crucial public health measure is to find ways to mitigate overcrowding through rapid expansion of hospital facilities or through a so-called curve flattening strategy" (https://doi.org/10.1016/S2214-109X(21)00313-2).

They added that South Africa has not yet had the same vaccine coverage as most of the rest of the world, largely due to vaccine supply, global vaccine availability, and vaccine nationalism.

During March 2020-March 2021, researchers looked at patient admission data from 644 national hospitals to compare patient characteristics between the 1st COVID wave in July 2020 and the 2nd wave in January 2021, when the beta variant dominated the country. Primary outcome was mortality risk factors, based on adjusted variables such as province, age, comorbidities, health sector, race, sex, and mode of admission. South African patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (RT-PCR or SARS-CoV-2 antigen test) were included, if they were admitted for at least one full day in a hospital.

Of 219 265 COVID-19 patients with an in-hospital outcome, 51 037 patients died with an in-hospital case-fatality risk of 23.28%. The peak of the 1st wave had a significantly lower case-fatality risk (21.80%; 95% CI, 21.39-22.22) than the peak of the 2nd wave (29.34%; 95%, CI 28.95-29.74).

During the 1st wave, the average weekly hospital admission rate increased 20%, but increased 43% during the 2nd wave (ratio of growth rate, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.18-1.20).

Compared to the 1st wave, risk factors for hospital admission in the 2nd wave included being ages 40-64 (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.31), age 65 or older compared with age 40 and younger (aOR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.25-1.52), being of mixed race compared with being white (aOR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.06-1.38), admitted in the public sector (aOR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.41-1.92), and high weekly hospital admissions (more than 8000 admissions) versus low weekly admissions (fewer than 3500 admissions) (aOR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.81-2.95).

Risk of in-hospital fatality per case was 17.7% during low admission weeks but rose to 26.9% during high admission weeks (aOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.17-1.32).

Jassat and co-authors stated that their study described the demographic shift from the 1st to the 2nd wave of COVID-19 in South Africa, and "quantifies the impact of overwhelmed hospital capacity on in-hospital mortality."

"We would like to scale up national genomic surveillance to better monitor the emergence of variants, and we are working with partners on case control studies to determine more conclusively the severity of the beta variant," Jassat told MedPage Today separately. "Many countries may experience the emergence of new variants, and studies like this may assist them to determine the change in characteristics of patients and severity of disease, in waves where variants predominate."

Limitations included the use of DATCOV surveillance data sequenced for results, rather than individual-level data per patient on variant lineage. This resulted in missing race and comorbidity data being "filled in" or adjusted for in sequencing (https://www.nicd.ac.za/diseases-a-z-index/covid-19/surveillance-reports/daily-hospital-surveillance-datcov-report/).

[2] Vaccine efficacy in pregnancy
Date: Tue 13 Jul 2021

Two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine were safe and 78% effective in preventing infection in pregnant women in a real-world study in Israel. Led by researchers at Maccabi Healthcare Services in Tel Aviv, the retrospective, observational study was published yesterday [12 Jul 2021] in JAMA. It involved analyzing data on 15 060 women in a pregnancy registry of a large, state-mandated healthcare system who were vaccinated with a 1st dose from 19 Dec 2020 through 28 Feb 2021.

The women were matched in a 1:1 ratio with unvaccinated pregnant women by age, gestational age, residential area, population subgroup, number of times they had given birth, and flu vaccination status (a proxy for health-seeking behavior) and followed until 11 Apr 2021.

Among the 7530 vaccinated women, 118 (1.6%) were infected with SARS-CoV-2 at least 28 days after their 1st dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine compared with 202 in the 7530 (2.7%) unvaccinated women. Cumulative incidence was 1.85% among vaccinees and 3.90% among unvaccinated women, a difference of 2.05 percentage points. COVID-19-related hospitalization rates were 0.2% in vaccinated women and 0.3% in the unvaccinated.

"In this large population-based cohort of pregnant women, BNT162b2 vaccination compared with no vaccination was associated with a significantly lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the absolute risk difference was small," the study authors wrote.

A total of 88 of 105 infected vaccinated women (83.8%) had coronavirus symptoms, versus 149 of 179 (83.2%) in the unvaccinated women, a nonsignificant difference.

At 28 days, 4788 of 7530 women (63.6%) remained at follow-up in each group. The absolute cumulative number of events was 109 in vaccinated women and 158 in the unvaccinated, and the difference in cumulative incidence was 0.80%. Cumulative incidence was 1.55% in the vaccinated group and 2.34% in the unvaccinated.

Over 28-70 days of follow-up, 10 vaccinated and 46 unvaccinated women tested positive for coronavirus (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33% vs 1.64%, respectively), for an absolute difference of 1.31% and an adjusted HR (aHR) of 0.22.

Risk reduction rose over time after vaccination, as indicated by a time-varying covariate. In the 10 days after vaccination, there was no significant difference between aHRs (0.96) in the 2 groups of women. But among vaccinees, there was a statistically significant hazard reduction from 11-27 days after vaccination (aHR, 0.46).

During follow-up, 18.4% of the vaccinated group and 18.9% of the unvaccinated group reached the end of pregnancy. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of rates of preeclampsia (maternal high blood pressure and organ damage), smaller-than-expected babies for gestational age, birth weight, abortion, stillbirth, maternal death, or pulmonary embolism (blockage of a pulmonary artery).

While 68 patients reported vaccine-related adverse events, none were severe. The most common side effects were headache (10 [0.1%]), weakness (8 [0.1%]), unspecified pain (6 [less than 0.1%]), and stomachache (5 [less than 0.1%]). All symptoms resolved within one day.

Among vaccinated women, 46% were in their 2nd or 3rd trimester, compared with 33% in the unvaccinated group. Mean age was 31.1 years, and the median follow-up for SARS-CoV-2 infection was 37 days.

The authors noted that changes in hormone levels and immune function in pregnancy may raise the risk of viral infection. And while COVID-19 infection in pregnancy is usually asymptomatic or mild, it can result in admission to an intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation, especially in the 3rd trimester. Symptomatic infections have also been tied to higher odds of preterm delivery and fetal distress during birth.

The study was particularly important, the researchers said, because while the Pfizer vaccine showed 85% efficacy in preventing infection 7 days or more after the 2nd dose in a phase 3 clinical trial, pregnant women were not included.

[3] Vaccine mandates
Date: Tue 13 Jul 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/07/covid-19-scan-jul-13-2021


Today [13 Jul 2021] a consensus statement by several leading public health organizations and a commentary in the Annals of Internal Medicine voiced support for mandating COVID-19 vaccinations in US healthcare workers (HCWs).

The consensus statement, published in Infection Control & Hospital Epidemiology, was submitted by 7 associations and societies, including the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the Association for Professionals in Epidemiology and Infection Control (APIC), and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), and it covered US COVID vaccines' real-world effectiveness data, clinical trial findings, and safety results.

The 3 COVID-19 vaccines under US emergency use authorization (EUA) have a high efficacy to prevent COVID-19 infection, an even higher efficacy against serious infection, and high effectiveness against COVID infection, the authors write. They also note that the vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer/BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson) have good profiles.

"Exemptions from this policy apply to those with medical contraindications to all COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States and other exemptions as specified by federal or state law," write the authors. "The consensus statement also supports COVID-19 vaccination of non-employees functioning at a healthcare facility (for example, students, contract workers, volunteers, etc.)" (https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/infection-control-and-hospital-epidemiology/article/multisociety-statement-on-covid19-vaccination-as-a-condition-of-employment-for-healthcare-personnel/690D1804B72FFF89C5FC0AED0043AD62).

The commentary frames the issue in the context of mandating flu vaccines, which some healthcare centers have been doing for almost 15 years. Not only is COVID-19 deadlier than the flu, [but also] it causes greater workplace and labor force disruptions and affected far more people in 2020 than the average yearly flu impact. Additionally, the authors add, all 3 COVID-19 vaccines under EUA in the United States have a higher vaccination effectiveness than the typical flu vaccine (70% to 95% vs 30% to 50%).

While healthcare organizations have taken care to protect workers, vaccines would provide continual protection without needing workplace or behavioral changes, the authors write. They add, "We cannot rely on patients being vaccinated to prevent nosocomial transmission because some patients cannot get the vaccine, some will decline, and vaccine may not be effective in immunocompromised patients"
(https://doi.org/10.7326/M21-2366).

COVID-19 seroprevalence less than 20% in US dialysis patients
-------------------------------------------------------------
COVID seroprevalence at the beginning of 2021 was 18.9% in 21 464 US patients who received dialysis, or roughly a rise of 15 percentage points compared with July 2020, according to a study yesterday [12 Jul 2021] in JAMA Network Open.

The researchers looked at 21 464 patients who received dialysis from US Renal Care facilities in January [2021], excluding people who had received COVID vaccinations. Less than 1 in 5 (18.4%) had COVID-19 antibodies, which translated to an 18.7% seroprevalence across the US dialysis population and 21.3% across the US adult population (95% confidence intervals, 18.1% to 19.2% and 20.3% to 22.3%, respectively).

Comparatively, in July 2020, unweighted seroprevalence was 4.4%, which translated to 4.7% in the US dialysis population and 5.4% in the general US population. The researchers also noted that in July [2020] seroprevalence was less uniformly spread across geographic areas and between urban and rural areas.

January 2021 dialysis patients were an average age of 63.1 years, with more than 49% 65 or older. More than half (57%) were men, and a disproportionate amount were of racial or ethnic minority (Hispanic, 18%; Black, 29%). In the unweighted sample, those who were 18 to 44 years old (25.9%), were Hispanic or lived in Hispanic neighborhoods (25.1%) or had the lowest income bracket (24.8%) had higher seroprevalence.

"The results suggest that, because these subpopulations overlap with people who express high levels of vaccine hesitancy in the US, vaccination campaigns may need to engage these high-risk groups to achieve sufficient penetration and reach community-level protection against SARS-CoV-2," the researchers write (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2781907.

[4] Netherlands
[A] Infections soar
Date: Tue 13 Jul 2021

Coronavirus infections in the Netherlands skyrocketed by more than 500% over the last week, the country's public health institute reported Tuesday [13 Jul 2021]. The surge follows the scrapping of almost all remaining lockdown restrictions and the reopening of night clubs in late June [2021].

The weekly update showing that nearly 52 000 people in the Netherlands tested positive for COVID-19 over the past week came a day after caretaker Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte apologized for the 26 Jun 2021 lockdown relaxation and called it "an error of judgment."

Rutte backtracked Friday [9 Jul 2021] and reintroduced some restrictions in an attempt to rein in the soaring infection rate. Bars again have to close at midnight, while discotheques and clubs were shuttered again until at least 13 Aug 2021.

The Netherlands, along with other European nations, is facing a rise in infections fueled by the more contagious delta variant just as governments hoped to greatly ease or eliminate remaining pandemic restrictions during the summer holiday season.

With infections rising around France, President Emmanuel Macron on Monday [12 Jul 2021] cranked up pressure on people to get vaccinated and said special COVID passes would be required to go into restaurants and shopping malls starting next month [August 2021].

The Dutch public health institute said that of the infections that could be traced to their source, 37% happened in a hospitality venue such as a bar or club. Infections among people ages 18-24 surged by 262%, followed by a 191% rise in 25-29 year-olds.

Despite the alarming rise in confirmed cases, hospital admissions increased by a modest 11%, or 60 COVID-19 patients, over the week, the institute said. Twelve of the admissions were to intensive care units.

More than 46% of the Netherlands' adult population is fully vaccinated, and more than 77% of the country's adults have had at least one shot. Health authorities said more than 1.3 million people would receive their 1st or 2nd doses this week.

Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said Monday [12 Jul 2021] that the late June loosening of restrictions combined with a lack of social distancing and the delta variant "has had, of course, an accelerating effect. You can unfortunately see that with hindsight."

Other countries in Europe are scrambling to accelerate coronavirus vaccinations in the hope of outpacing the spread of the more infectious delta variant.
