A carbon monoxide leak sent dozens of children and staffers at a Pennsylvania daycare center to local hospitals on Tuesday [11 Oct 2022] in an evacuation using every ambulance in the city of Allentown to the scene, authorities said on Tuesday.

At least 28 children and 7 adults were involved in the incident, which began with a report of an unconscious child at the Happy Smiles Learning Center shortly before 7 a.m., said Allentown Fire Chief Efrain Agosto. "I'm told all are stable and thank God, everyone is going to be fine," Agosto said. "This could have turned out really bad, lethal."

The firefighters who arrived for the medical check had gas detectors with them, which alerted the crew to the presence of the gas, which is odorless, colorless and potentially deadly. Agosto said once the gas was detected, more crew was called in and the building evacuated. "It was definitely a lethal situation," the fire chief said.

All 8 ambulances in the city, 60 miles (97 km) north of Philadelphia, as well as rescue crews from nearby communities, responded to the call. First responders found some children and adults who were showing signs of dizziness, nausea and vomiting, Agosto said, all symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning.

Officials did not have a number of how many people were in the building at the time, but according to the tracking site ChildcareCenter.us, the facility is licensed to care for 63 children. A spokesperson for Happy Smiles Learning Center was not immediately available for comment to Reuters.

The cause of the leak was not confirmed, but the chief said he believed it was the center's heating system which malfunctioned.

[As winter begins to settle in and people use various means of heating indoors, carbon monoxide poisoning cases may increase. Please install a carbon monoxide monitor and check it at least every 3 months to be sure it is working and the battery is powering it properly. Some people test their carbon monoxide monitors monthly just as they do their fire/smoke alarms. Every month is the recommended test interval time in many parts of the country.

"Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas. It cannot be seen or smelled. These facts make it extremely dangerous.

"Carbon monoxide is a chemical produced from the incomplete burning of natural gas or other products containing carbon. This includes exhaust, faulty heaters, fires, and factory emissions.

"When breathing in carbon monoxide, the poison replaces the oxygen in your bloodstream. Your heart, brain, and body will become starved of oxygen.

"Symptoms vary from person to person. Those at high risk include young children, older adults, people with lung or heart disease, people who are at high altitudes, and smokers. Carbon monoxide can harm a fetus (unborn baby still in the womb). [It can also cause death in pets, so please check frequently that your pet is OK and moving appropriately. Do not assume the pet is sleeping without waking the pet. - Mod.TG]

"Symptoms/ signs of carbon monoxide poisoning may include:
- Breathing problems, including no breathing, shortness of breath, or rapid breathing
- Chest pain (may occur suddenly in people with angina)
- Coma
- Confusion
- Convulsions
- Dizziness
- Drowsiness
- Fainting [falling over and unable to walk or sit up for pets. - Mod.TG]
- Fatigue
- General weakness and achiness [pets experience this too. - Mod.TG]
- Headache
- Hyperactivity
- Impaired judgment
- Irritability
- Low blood pressure
- Muscle weakness
- Rapid or abnormal heartbeat
- Shock
- Nausea and vomiting
- Unconsciousness

"Animals can also be poisoned by carbon monoxide. People who have pets at home may notice their animals become weak or unresponsive from carbon monoxide exposure. Often the pets will get sick before humans.

"Since many of these signs can occur with viral illnesses, carbon monoxide poisoning is often confused with these conditions. This can lead to a delay in getting help.

"Removing the patient [and pets - Mod.TG] to the open air may help, but the affected individual may need emergency treatment of oxygen, and perhaps additional supportive care for heart or lung issues.

"Carbon monoxide poisoning can cause death. For those who survive, recovery is slow. How well a person does depends on the amount and length of exposure to the carbon monoxide. Permanent brain damage may occur.

"If the person still has impaired mental ability after 2 weeks, the chance of a complete recovery is worse. Impaired mental ability can reappear after a person has been symptom-free for 1 to 2 weeks" (https://www.pennmedicine.org/for-patients-and-visitors/patient-information/conditions-treated-a-to-z/carbon-monoxide-poisoning).

We wish all involved well and a speedy recovery. - Mod.TG
