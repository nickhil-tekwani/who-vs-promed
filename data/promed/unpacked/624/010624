[In 2010, France, Germany, The Netherlands, and The United Kingdom all had problems stemming from the importation of horses either from Romania or horses that had been in contact with Romanian export horses. Whether this outbreak has anything to do with the previous outbreaks is unclear at this time.

While most equine infectious anemia (EIA) outbreaks occur in the summer time in association with biting fly vector (tabanids such as horse or deer flies) population increases, the disease has previously been found in November and December of the year. EIA can be transmitted through contaminated hypodermic needles or other instruments such as those used to float teeth, when proper instrument decontamination or single usage policies for syringes are absent or ineffective. - Mod.PC]
