Listeria cluster in Canton Neuenberg
------------------------------------
In 2005, as of 16 Jun, 38 cases of _Listeria monocytogenes_ infection have
been reported to the Federal Department for Health [Bundesamt fur
Gesundheit (BAG)], compared with 16 cases for the same period in 2004. The
increased reports on _Listeria_ isolates in Neuenberg were brought to the
attention of the BAG on 25 May 2005 by the National Reference Center for
Listeria (CNRL, Lausanne). Since the middle of Apr 2005, there have been 10
reported cases of listeriosis in Neuenberg, with 7 detected between 18 May
and 4 Jun 2005. 8 cases were severely ill hospitalized patients, 3 of whom
have died. 2 pregnant patients suffered miscarriages because of listeria
infections. All 10 of the CNRL investigated isolates had identical 1/2a
serotypes.
Patient questioning implicated a local soft cheese product made of
pasteurized milk. Through the advice of the canton chemist, the production
of this cheese was stopped and distributed product was recovered and
destroyed. On 8 Jun 2005, several of the cheese samples tested positive for
_L. monocytogenes_. CNRL also verified serotype 1/2a in these samples. In
the meantime, other listeria-contaminated milk products by the same
manufacturer were identified. The manufacturer may resume production when
the breaches in the production line are identified and rectified, so the
cheese can be safely brought to market.
To more clearly identify the source of contamination, a molecular
biological analysis is currently under way on the clinical and cheese
samples. The results of this more complete analysis will be released within
a week.
Listeria is a bacterium widely distributed throughout the environment, and
therefore the agricultural world. It can multiply in food that is stored
for a long time, even at refrigerated temperatures. People may be infected
through dairy or meat products. This outbreak has shown that the use of
pasteurized milk does not provide certain safety, because contamination can
occur afterwards.
