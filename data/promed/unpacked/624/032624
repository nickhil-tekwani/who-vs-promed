The Bolivian government will initiate a vaccination campaign against
yellow fever, following the deaths of 3 people who contracted the
disease, according to the Minister of Health, Nila Heredia.
Immunizations will begin on 15 Apr [2007] and continue for one month.
Recent floods which have affected eastern Bolivia have contributed to
the breeding of the mosquito which transmits the disease [virus. -
Mod. TY], _Aedes aegypti_. Since January [2007] 4 people contracted
the disease, 3 died and one is out of danger, according to the
Director of Epidemiology, Rene Barrientos. The massive vaccination
plan will cover the 324 municipalities of the whole country by means
of mobile brigades.

[Bolivian health authorities have confirmed 6 cases of yellow fever,
of which 3 died. El Parte Epidemiologico No.9, distributed by the
Epidemiological Unit, part of the Ministry of Health, indicated that
2 cases occurred in La Asunta Municipality, of La Paz [department], 1
case in Carrasco de Cochabamba Province and the other in the [Santa]
Cruz municipality of Yapacani. - Mod. JT (trans. Mod. TY).]
[Unfortunately, eastern, low-land Bolivia has been suffering a major
dengue outbreak as well. Both viruses are transmitted by the same
mosquito, _Aedes aegypti_, which is apparently very abundant in this
region. That suggests that the risk of yellow fever virus
transmission is high if the population has not been vaccinated before.
The Bolivian Ministry of Health's Weekly Epidemiological Report
<http://www.sns.gov.bo/bolsns/Vigilancia2007.htm#FIEBREAMARILLA>
reports the same 33 suspected YF cases for 2007 that were included in
the 19 Mar 2007 ProMED post (Archive no. 20070319.0969). There is no
indication that more than 6 of these suspected cases have been
confirmed subsequently. A map of Bolivia can be accessed at
