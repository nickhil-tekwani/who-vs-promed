infecting lisianthus (_Eustoma grandiflorum_) in the UK: 1st finding
and detection by real-time PCR. BSPP New Disease Reports, vol. 16]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In June 2007, a sample of leaves was received from a year-round crop
of lisianthus (_Eustoma grandiflorum_) growing under glass in
Suffolk, England. The sample exhibited necrosis, mainly observed as
pale, necrotic lesions (Fig. 1). In the worst affected block up to 20
percent of plants were reported as showing similar symptoms.

A test performed by another laboratory had previously detected _Iris
yellow spot virus_ (IYSV) in the symptomatic plants. To confirm this
diagnosis officially, an ELISA [enzyme linked immunosorbent assay]
test was performed. This test was positive. The result was confirmed
using a new real-time PCR [polymerase chain reaction] assay. This new
assay was designed using an available IYSV nucleocapsid (NC) protein
gene sequence and further alignments against 45 other IYSV sequences
available on public databases. It was validated with 4 known IYSV isolates.

For further confirmation, conventional RT [reverse transcription]-PCR
was performed on extracts made from leaf material with symptoms. A
product of the correct predicted size (822 basepairs) was obtained
and sequenced. The deduced NC gene sequence obtained was analysed and
shown to share at least 84 percent nucleotide identity with all other
IYSV NC sequences; the highest homology (98 percent) being with a
Dutch isolate from _Iris hollandica_.

Widely distributed around the world in onion and leek crops, IYSV has
been identified in various ornamental crops, including lisianthus.
However, this is the 1st finding of IYSV in the UK. The infected crop
has now been removed and measures taken to eradicate the infection.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
_Iris yellow spot virus_ (IYSV; family _Bunyaviridae_, genus
_Tospovirus_) is an economically important viral pathogen of onion
vectored by onion thrips (_Thrips tabaci_ Lindeman). Rapid spread of
IYSV has occurred in the western United States and Georgia, with
recent reports of IYSV from New York in the northeastern United States.

In June and mid-July of 2007, symptomatic plants were found in
Ontario, Canada in onions grown from sets in a home garden in Grey
County (44 deg 27 min N, 80 deg 53 min W) and on a small commercial
farm in Ottawa-Carleton County (45 deg 14 min N, 75 deg 28 min W),
respectively. In the home garden, bleached, elongated lesions with
tapered ends occurred on middle-aged leaves of 30 percent of 100
plants. By August 2007, 91 percent of these plants were symptomatic.
In Ottawa-Carleton, 2 lesions with green centers and yellow borders
occurred on a single leaf of a single plant in a field of 1120 plants.

Symptomatic leaf tissue tested positive for IYSV in a double-antibody
sandwich (DAS)-ELISA. These 2 isolated and remote finds of IYSV in
Ontario prompted a survey in early August of 2007 of the Holland
Marsh (44 deg 5 min N, 79 deg 35 min W), the largest onion-producing
region in Ontario. A total of 9 onion fields separated geographically
across the Holland Marsh Region were scouted and one to 3 samples of
symptomatic tissue per field were analyzed by DAS-ELISA. IYSV was
confirmed in 7 of 9 (78 percent) fields surveyed and in 13 of 16 (81
percent) of the individual samples.

A reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay was used to verify the
presence of IYSV in one new symptomatic tissue sample per field
collected from three of the fields where IYSV was confirmed by ELISA.
RT-PCR specific to the small (S) RNA of IYSV was used. The resulting
product, which included the 772 basepair nucleocapsid (N) gene was
cloned and sequenced. Sequence analysis showed that the N gene of the
Ontario isolate shared 92 to 98 percent nucleotide sequence identity
with known IYSV N gene sequences.

To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of IYSV infection of onion
in Ontario and Canada. This finding confirms further spread of the
virus within North America and the need for research to develop more
effective management options to reduce the impact of IYSV on onion
production. The finding of IYSV in remote and isolated locations
where onions were grown from sets implies that the spread of IYSV via
infected bulbs warrants further investigation as a potentially
important route of distribution of the virus.

[IYSV has only recently been confirmed as a member of the genus
_Tospovirus_ by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of
Viruses (ICTV). New tospoviruses are being found frequently, and the
type member of the genus _Tomato spotted wilt virus_ (TSWV), has had
a serious impact on many crop species worldwide.

IYSV (as well as TSWV) has been included in the Alert List of the
European Plant Pathology Organisation (EPPO). Known hosts include
onion, leek, iris, amaryllis, lisianthus, and weeds including wild
relatives of onion (_Allium_ species). IYSV has been reported from a
number of locations in North and southern America, Europe, Asia,
South Africa, and Australia. The economic impact is low in some
areas, but up to 100 percent loss has been observed in onion crops,
for example, in Brazil.

The virus is transmitted by the onion thrips, _Thrips tabaci_. Thrips
are the most common and serious insect pest of onions. High
populations of thrips can reduce both yield and keeping quality of
crops. Thrips are most damaging when they feed during the early
bulbing stage of plant development. Both adults and nymphs cause
damage. Severe scarring also creates an entry point for foliar leaf diseases.

Spread of IYSV occurs with infected plant material and viruliferous
vector insects. Ornamental hosts, such as lisianthus, and weeds may
serve as pathogen reservoirs since thrips may also feed on them. The
virus appears not to be seed transmitted. Tospovirus epidemiology is
complex and natural resistance appears to be rare amongst their plant
hosts. Management of IYSV and its vector includes the use of clean
propagative material, cultural practices, and pesticides.
