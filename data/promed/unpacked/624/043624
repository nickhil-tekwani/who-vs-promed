The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) informed
the Southern Nevada Health District last year that 2 cases of
Legionnaires' disease had been possibly linked to the Aria. But it
wasn't until last month that local officials tested the water at the
posh Strip resort and discovered the type of bacteria that causes the
disease. The tests were done only after health officials determined
that 6 former patrons of the hotel had been diagnosed with the
disease, a form of pneumonia. And that, says a CDC official, is the
proper protocol. "We recommend what they did there at 1st, an
environmental assessment," said Laurel Garrison, a CDC specialist in
the disease.

Health officials explained their procedures in the wake of the news
Thursday [14 Jul 2011] that Aria officials are notifying patrons who
stayed at the hotel from 21 Jun to 4 Jul [2011] that they might have
been exposed to the sometimes-fatal Legionnaires' bacteria
[_Legionella pneumophila_]. It's the latest bad news for the
CityCenter development, whose mothballed Harmon tower came under
scrutiny earlier this week after a structural engineer said it had
construction defects that could cause it to collapse in an
earthquake.

A total of 6 former patrons of the Aria, people who stayed there
between December 2009 and April [2011], have come down with the
disease. All have recovered. It wasn't until all 6 cases were linked
that officials felt the need to test the hotel's water.

Though the Aria cases stretch back almost to the 16 Dec 2009 grand
opening of the 4000-room hotel, officials say they need to notify only
those guests who stayed during the recent 2-week period because of the
disease's incubation period of 2 to 14 days. So far, none of the
notified patrons, nor any hotel employees, has reported contracting
the disease, according to the health district's Jennifer Sizemore.

The notification letter informs people of symptoms and advises them
to seek medical attention if they feel ill. The letter also urges
anyone who has further questions to contact company representatives.
Alan Feldman, senior vice president of public affairs for MGM Resorts
International, declined to say how many letters had been sent out to
customers of the hotel.

When health district environmental health employees inspected the
Aria in June 2010, they found nothing to make them think that a
possible outbreak was under way. "We then did a stem-to-stern
assessment of the Aria," said Mark Bergtholdt, a district
environmental health supervisor. "What we found was a hot water system
that was in great shape." _Legionella_, the bacterium that causes
Legionnaires' disease, is often found in air-conditioning cooling
towers, whirlpool spas, showers, faucets or other water sources. The
bacterium can rapidly reproduce in warm, stagnant waters.

The 2 cases that had been reported to the CDC by state health
officials -- and then reported to the Southern Nevada Health District
-- were several months apart, in 2009 and 2010, according to
Bergtholdt. Even as the Aria was being inspected in 2010, another
report of a possible case linked to the hotel came to the health
district from the CDC. Yet given what Bergtholdt and other
environmental specialists found during the inspection at the Aria --
what appeared to be complete compliance with guidelines -- the
determination was made not to test the water. "If we had found
anything to suggest that they had a breeding ground for _Legionella_,
we would have tested water for it," Bergtholdt said. "What we're doing
is risk assessment," he said.

And officials, he admitted, are conscious of the cost of testing. "It
costs USD 200 a test," he said. "Just one room of faucets and showers
and so forth can cost USD 1000. Test 10 rooms and you're talking about
USD 10 000."

During this year, Bergtholdt said, 3 more cases possibly stemming
from the Aria were reported to the health district from the CDC. The 2
most recent cases, from this spring, were reported in June. "That
showed a definite association (with the Aria), and testing began," he
said. Elevated levels of the bacteria causing the disease were found
during tests between 21 Jun and 4 Jul 2011.

Multiple rooms were found to have the bacterium in either faucets or
showers. Bergtholdt won't specify which rooms were found to have it or
exactly how many rooms had it. MGM's Feldman said 3 rooms were
involved but did not say which ones.

Bergtholdt said to ensure that none of the bacteria continue to exist
at the Aria, extra chlorine has recently been fed into the hot water
system of rooms that are fed by a single water outlet. "You let it sit
and then you flush the system," Bergtholdt said. Blocks of 500 to 1000
rooms of the 4000-room hotel are closed off during the cleansing
effort, which he said "takes overnight to complete."

Public health officials don't have to test other hotels in the
CityCenter complex because water lines that go to Aria aren't shared
with other hotels, he said. At this point the health district, or
taxpayers, are picking up the tab for the work at the Aria, said
Bergtholdt, who added that the district might ask the Aria to pick up
the tab. He said the district has conducted water tests on fewer than
15 rooms, and the Aria is doing tests of its own on water outlets in
other rooms.

CDC's specialists Garrison and Laurie Hicks called _Legionella_ a
"ubiquitous organism" that can be found in many locations, including
in natural as well as artificial water systems. Although tests can
show evidence of bacteria, they said, the disease is only caught
through inhaling contaminated water vapor. It is possible, Garrison
said, that others came down with symptoms of the disease and were
treated with antibiotics, but the cases were never diagnosed as
Legionnaire's disease. Doctors must do a specific test to confirm the
diagnosis, she said.

"In an abundance of caution, we are attempting to notify guests who
may have been exposed to these bacteria during this short period,"
Paul Berry, vice president of hotel operations at Aria, wrote in a
letter mailed to guests and posted online at
http://www.arialasvegas.com/facts. Feldman said the hotel has
implemented a comprehensive abatement effort. All subsequent tests
have come back with no detectable levels of active Legionella, Feldman
said. Berry said Legionella is a concern for all large buildings, and
Aria has a comprehensive water management program in place, which
includes regular testing. "We will continue to monitor our water
quality on an ongoing basis to ensure the safety of the water system
and our guests," he said.

[The following has been extracted from the U.S. CDC document
Travel-Associated Legionnaires' Disease
http://www.cdc.gov/legionella/faq.htm:

"About 20-25 percent of all Legionnaires' disease reported to CDC is
travel-associated. Legionnaires' disease is important to diagnose and
to report because its identification implies the presence of an
environmental source to which other susceptible individuals are likely
to be exposed. Clusters of Legionnaires' disease associated with
travel to hotels or aboard cruise ships are rarely detected by
individual clinicians or health departments; travelers typically
disperse from the source of infection before developing symptoms.
Therefore, a travel history should be actively sought from patients
with community-acquired pneumonia and _Legionella_ testing should be
performed for those who have traveled in the 2 weeks before onset of
symptoms.

"_Because of the multi-state nature of travel in the U. S.,
national-level surveillance is necessary to detect outbreaks of
travel-associated Legionnaires' disease. CDC relies upon state and
local health departments to conduct this surveillance. Surveillance
through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS)
is still important for monitoring national trends; all cases should be
reported through NNDSS."

"Because of the public health importance of timely reporting, inform
CDC of travel-associated cases by emailing <travellegionella@cdc.gov>
about the patient's movements in the 2-10 days before onset."

"Environmental sampling/testing should only be conducted after
careful consideration of the epidemiologic evidence linking a case(s)
to a particular location."

The following article is linked to the CDC document: Barbaree JM, et
al. Protocol for Sampling Environmental Sites for Legionellae. Applied
Environmental Microbiol 1987; 53:1454-8: "Since legionellae not
related to disease may be found in many of the sites sampled, an
epidemiologic association with the probable source should be
established before intervention methods, such as disinfection, are
undertaken."

"Random sampling without an epidemiologic evaluation and comparing
isolates from the environment and from patients could lead to false
conclusions about sources of epidemic strains."

Potential environmental sampling sites for _Legionella_ spp that the
CDC document suggests include: internal surfaces of faucets, aerators,
and shower heads; and water from incoming water main, holding tanks
and cisterns, water heater tanks, decorative fountains, irrigation
equipment, fire sprinkler system (if recently used), whirlpools, and
spas. Because _Legionella_ may be found in water supplies without
linkage to any cases, the actual causative source should be
demonstrated by matching the genotype of the environmental isolates
with that of any clinical isolates to assure frequently costly
corrective measures are carried out on the actual source
