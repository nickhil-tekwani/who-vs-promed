Global Influenza Situation as of 11 February 1998:
Influenza activity continues to increase in the northern hemisphere. The
number of influenza virus isolates or sentinel reports on influenza
activity increased markedly in Canada and USA during January. In Asia,
widespread activity has been reported in Israel, Islamic Republic of Iran
and Japan. Reports from Europe continue to indicate mainly sporadic
activity but regional activity has been reported in France and Spain and
local outbreaks in Czech Republic, Italy, Russian Federation, and the
United Kingdom. Influenza A is the predominant influenza type and where
influenza A has been further identified, the H3N2 subtype is most
frequently reported, except in the Russian Federation and the United
Kingdom where H1N1 is more common than H3N2. Since 1 October influenza
A(H3N2) has been confirmed in Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile,
Fiji, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Italy,
Japan, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian
