Pigs have tested positive for bird flu in the same village on Indonesia's
Sumatra island where 5 people have been confirmed infected with the H5N1
avian influenza virus, a minister said on Thursday.
The incident, involving up to 7 family members, 6 of whom have died, has
raised alarm around the world because authorities cannot rule out
human-to-human transmission.
But the World Health Organization and Indonesian health officials had been
frustrated by the lack of evidence pointing to a source of the virus,
usually infected poultry. WHO confirmed on Wednesday that 5 members of the
family had contracted H5N1 and tests on a 6th were pending.
Officials had said earlier that on-the-spot testing of various animals
living around Kubu Simbelang village in North Sumatra province had given
negative results for avian influenza. Map of Indonesia at

But agriculture minister Anton Apriyantono told reporters on Thursday the
pig samples from the village had been brought to a leading animal research
centre on Java island, and scientists there found a positive result for
bird flu. "After we brought them to Bogor, the serology test found positive
results. From 11 pig samples, 10 are positive. Reconfirmation testings are
still under way," he said, but did not specify the H5N1 virus. Bogor is a
West Java city where a veterinary institute is located.
Clusters of human infections are worrying because they indicate that the
virus might be mutating into a form that is easily transmissible among
humans. For the moment, the virus is mainly a disease in birds and is hard
for humans to catch.
The minister's comments are also likely to concern health officials. Pigs
can act as mixing vessels in which human and bird flu viruses can swap
genes, leading to a strain that can easily infect people and pass from
person to person.
At least 30 people have died of bird flu in Indonesia, the second highest
toll of any country. More than half that number have died in 2006.
Not including the latest WHO confirmed cases in Indonesia, the disease has
killed 115 people worldwide, the majority in east Asia, since reappearing
in 2003. Virtually all the victims caught the disease from poultry.
The H5N1 virus is endemic in much of Indonesia.

[Serological or other evidence for the possible current involvement of pigs
in the epidemiology of HPAI H5N1 in Indonesia deserve to be carefully
analysed and confirmed by a reference laboratory.
An official notification, sent by the Indonesian Veterinary Services to the
OIE on 23 May 2005 (see 20050601.1526), said that H5N1 AI virus was
detected in nasal swabs from clinically sound pigs in 2 locations within
the Tangerang district, Banten province, West Java. Out of 26 swabs sampled
on 23 Feb 2005, 14 Apr 2005 and 26 Apr 2005, 12 were reportedly found
positive. It further stated that "partial stamping out" was "to be undertaken."
Thus far, no clinical cases in pigs have been reported from Indonesia. -
