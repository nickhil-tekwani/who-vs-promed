The Brazil Ministry of Health today [10 Jan 2017] announced a "fractionated" vaccination campaign in the states of São Paulo, Río de Janeiro, and Bahía, with the goal of immunizing 19.7 million people against yellow fever, due to the increase in cases since last year [2017].

In an announcement, the agency stated that in order to have an effective campaign, the states will adopt the fractionated dose method, that is to say, a dose of the yellow fever vaccine that would normally be applied to just one person will now reach 4. According to the Ministry, a single dose could cover 5 people, but the government will work with a "safety margin". [The fractionated dose strategy used in the vaccination campaign in DR Congo was 1/5 of the normal dose, with a single dose covering 5 people. Apparently, the Brazil strategy is to apply 1/4 the usual dose. - Mod.TY]

The fractionated dose will not be given to all; for children 9 months-2 years, people with specific clinical conditions such as patients with HIV AIDS, pregnant, and international travelers will continue to receive the [full] standard dose.

A total of 15 million Brazilians will receive the fractionated dose and another 4.7 million the standard dose in 75 municipalities in the states being considered.

The division of the usual dose has been studied by he Ministry of Health for some time, although it began to be considered for implementation in March of [2017], according to a statement issued by the head of the agency, Ricardo Barros, who was cited in the communication. "The results of people who received the fractioned dose was followed for 8 years and their immunity is the same as those receiving the standard dose," he explained.

This will be the 1st time that the vaccine has been divided in Brazil, a method that was used in Africa in 2016.

This Tuesday morning [9 Jan 2018], the São Paulo Secretariat of Public Health stated that the number of fatal cases of the disease increased to 13, 3 of whom were in the São Paulo metropolitan region.

This is the 1st time since 1942 that cases of urban yellow fever have been registered. [These were cases of spill-over from the sylvan (forest) transmission cycle, not the urban _Aedes aegypti_ transmission cycle, but are the 1st to occur in the urban, metropolitan area. - Mod.TY]

The vaccines for the campaign will be produced and provided by Bio-Manguinhos, a state laboratory of Fiocruz, the institution that did the tests on the fractionated vaccine.

"We do not know what is going to happen with the yellow fever area this year [2018], but as a precaution we are regulating our (existing) stock, keeping some vaccine in stock, for future needs," said Barros.

The fractionation strategy is a preventive measure recommended by the World Health Organization in special cases. This measure is advised when there is an increase in the epizootic (an epidemic affecting animals) and cases of intensive sylvan [forest] yellow fever, with risk of spill-over of the disease in populated cities and that have not had vaccination recommended for some time. According to the Ministry of Health, studies done by Fiocruz assure that a person vaccinated with a fractioned dose will have at least 8 years of immunity.

Yellow fever is an infectious, acute febrile disease caused by a virus that can lead to an individual's death in the lapse of a week if not treated rapidly. The most common symptoms of the disease are high fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, nausea, and vomiting that can last on average 3 days.

The virus is transmitted by the bite of a vector mosquito and there is not direct transmission between an infected person and another.

Currently, there is no existing specific treatment against the virus [infection], so that treatment is symptomatic with different methods seeking to remediate as much as possible any organ failure, awaiting the recuperation of the patient.

After the confirmation of at least 12 deaths in 2017 from yellow fever in the São Paulo metropolitan area, health officials have announced a massive vaccination campaign against yellow fever [starting] in February [2018]. Authorities say that the vaccine given during the campaign, however, will be 'fractionated', or divided into 4 doses.

"There is no difference in efficacy between fractional and integral vaccines. What we are discussing is the time protection lasts with a level of sufficient antibodies for a number of years," noted David Uip, São Paulo state's Health Secretary, trying to dispel rumors that there may not be enough vaccines to go around.

The fractionated dose was defined by a Ministry of Health directive, and has proven efficacy for 8 years, while the full dose lasts a lifetime. According to officials, however, children between 9 months and 2 years, pregnant women in risk areas, those with renal and diabetes problems, and those travelling to countries where the vaccine is required, will be given the full dose.

"The expectation is that, with the fractionated dose about 4.5 million people will be vaccinated and another 1.5 million will be given the full dose," explained Rejane de Paula, director of the Center for Epidemiological Surveillance for São Paulo state during a press conference earlier this week.

The campaign will run from [3-24 Feb 2018] and target 53 cities including the capital, São Paulo city. Meanwhile authorities urge residents who haven't been vaccinated to avoid parks and wooded areas where the mosquito carrying the yellow fever virus may be found.

Last October [2017] 13 parks in the city were closed as a precaution after monkeys infected with the yellow fever virus were found dead in the area. In late December [2017] another 10 urban parks in the south and west of São Paulo city were closed indefinitely, "as a measure to prevent the spread of yellow fever", according to officials.

These vaccination campaigns are very ambitious but prudent, given the continuation of cases and evidence of circulation of the virus in the sylvan (forest) cycle of transmission. One hopes that they will do follow-up studies on persistence of immunity following vaccination and track any adverse reactions to the vaccine. - Mod.TY]
