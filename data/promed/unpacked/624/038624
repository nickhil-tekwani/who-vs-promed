[1] CDC report
Date: Thu 12 Aug 2010
Source: CDC [edited]
<http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/typhoidfever/index.html>


The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is collaborating with
public health officials in 2 states and the FDA to investigate an outbreak
of _Salmonella enterica_ infections, serotype Typhi. _Salmonella_ Typhi is
the bacterium that causes typhoid fever. Typhoid fever is a very rare
illness in the USA among non-international travelers and can cause serious
symptoms, often requiring hospital treatment. Typhoid fever is contracted
when food and water are contaminated by an infected individual and are then
consumed by other people. Investigators are using DNA analysis of bacteria
obtained through diagnostic testing to identify cases of illness that may
be part of this outbreak.

Between 25 May 2010 and 9:00am EDT on 12 Aug 2010, a total of 7 confirmed
and 2 probable individuals infected with a matching strain of _S._ Typhi
have been reported from 2 states. Confirmed cases are people with illness
on or after 1 Jan 2010 and a DNA fingerprint matching the outbreak strain.
Probable cases are people with a _S._ Typhi infection and a strong
epidemiologic link to the outbreak. The number of cases identified in each
state with this strain is as follows: CA (3 confirmed and 2 probable) and
NV (4 confirmed).

Among those whose reported illness onset dates are available, illnesses
began between 10 Apr 2010 and 23 Jul 2010. Infected individuals range in
age from 4 to 31 years old (median 21 years). 67 per cent of cases are
female and 100 per cent report Hispanic ethnicity. Among 7 patients with
available clinical information, 5 (71 per cent) were hospitalized. 5 (83
per cent) of 6 patients interviewed reported no international travel in the
60 days prior to illness onset. As of 12 Aug 2010, no deaths attributed to
this infection have been reported.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
CDC and public health officials in 2 states conducted an epidemiologic
study comparing foods eaten by ill people and [healthy controls]. Among ill
people interviewed, 5 (71 per cent) of 7 reported consuming frozen mamey
fruit pulp in a milkshake or smoothie, also called a "batido" or "licuado".
Upon further investigation, it was found that 4 (80 per cent) of 5 ill
people consumed Goya brand frozen mamey fruit pulp. Among healthy controls,
0 (0 per cent) of 33 reported exposure to frozen mamey fruit pulp. No other
food was found to be associated with illness. These results suggest that
eating frozen mamey fruit pulp is a likely source of these illnesses. This
investigation is ongoing. CDC and its public health partners will update
the public on the progress of this investigation as information becomes
available.

Mamey, also called "zapote" or "sapote", is a tropical fruit grown
primarily in Central and South America. It is prepared by removing the
inner seed and consuming the flesh raw, or adding it to milkshakes,
jellies, or other foods or beverages. When preparing frozen mamey fruit
pulp, it is peeled and mashed, and then consumed as a shake or smoothie.
Frozen mamey fruit pulp can be purchased in grocery stores throughout the
USA, and packages have a 2-3 year shelf life.

The sweet taste of an icy cold fruit smoothie on a hot day can hit the
spot, but some consumers may be at risk of it hitting their stomachs
instead. Goya Foods, a popular producer of Spanish, Mexican and Hispanic
foods has just announced that 14 ounce packages of Mamey Pulp may have been
contaminated with salmonella.

These recalled products were sold and distributed in Alaska, Arizona,
California, Colorado, Hawaii, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Texas, Utah and
Washington. The UPC number of the recalled Goya Mamey Pulp is 041331090803.

In a random test in Nevada one package of Goya Mamey pulp tested positive
for the organism.

[Foodborne outbreaks due to _S._ Typhi are unusual in the USA. It is
unclear where the contamination of the product occurred. Unlike most
salmonellas, _S._ Typhi is not a zoonosis, being acquired by contamination
of food or water with human feces. Mamey was previously linked to typhoid
cases in Florida in 1999.

The mamey sapote (_Pouteria sapota_)
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pouteria_sapota>) is a species of tree that
is native to southern Mexico. Today, the tree is cultivated not only in
Mexico, but also in Central America, the Caribbean, and South Florida for
its fruit, which is commonly eaten in many Latin American countries. Mamey
sapote is a large and highly ornamental evergreen tree that can reach a
height of 15 to 45 metres (60 to 140 feet) at maturity. Like most fruit
trees, it is mainly propagated by grafting, which ensures that the new
plant has the same characteristics as the parent, especially its fruit. It
is also considerably faster than growing trees by seed.

The fruit is about 10 to 25 cm (4 to 10 inches) long and 8 to 12 cm (3 to 5
inches) wide and has orange flesh. The fruit is eaten raw out of hand or
made into milkshakes, smoothies, ice cream and fruit bars. The fruit's
flavor is variously described as a combination of pumpkin, sweet potato,
and maraschino cherries with the texture of an avocado.

Typhoid fever, the disease caused in humans from infection with _Salmonella
enterica_ subtype Typhi, is a rare form of salmonellosis that is not a
zoonosis. Most cases in the USA and other areas of the developed world are
imported from abroad and secondary cases do not occur because of adequate
sewage systems unlike what occurs in much of the rest of the world where,
usually waterborne, outbreaks occur regularly. These cases are likely to be
linked epidemiologically related to a single source although that
information is not available.

The classical cluster of _S. typhi_ in the USA occurred related to a summer
house in the (still) wealthy suburb of New York City of Oyster Bay, Long
Island in August 1906. This was the still infamous cluster associated with
Mary Mallon, "Typhoid Mary", an Irish immigrant who was both a food
preparer and a typhoid bacillus carrier. A number of clusters have been
reported in the USA in the 21st century including:
- New York City: In the summer of 2000, an outbreak of endemic typhoid
fever involved 6 people in Queens, NY, and a 7th person in Manhattan, NY
(boroughs of New York City). An investigation by the New York City
Department of Health traced the likely source to an immigrant employee
working at a local restaurant (1).
- Ohio: In August 2000, the Ohio Department of Health reported a cluster of
men with typhoid fever who denied having traveled abroad. To determine the
cause and the extent of the outbreak, an epidemiological investigation was
initiated in which 7 people in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana with
culture-confirmed _S._ Typhi infection and 2 people with probable typhoid
fever were evaluated; all were men, and all but one reported having had sex
with 1 asymptomatic male carrier (2).
- New York City: 2 cases of _S. typhi_ infections in 2005 were acquired
domestically and linked to a chronic carrier Haitian traveler.
