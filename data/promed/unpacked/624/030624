KARNAL BUNT: USDA LIFTS RESTRICTIONS IN SOUTHEAST USA
======================================================
[see: Tilletia indica - United States of America 960607
Karnal bunt - California, USA 090924124615]
Date: March 18, 1997
From: USDA Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service Press
Release, March 17, 1977

The U.S. Department of Agriculture today announced it is lifting
all Karnal bunt emergency action notifications currently in place
in the Southeast.
"We've extensively studied the situation in the Southeast and
have concluded that Karnal bunt is not present there," said Terry
Medley, administrator of USDA's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service.
USDA is basing its decision regarding Karnal bunt on the fact
that bunted wheat kernels have not been found in any samples,
whereas contamination with bunted ryegrass kernels was common.
Researchers have shown that spores from ryegrass do not infect
wheat.
Some wheat samples collected during the national Karnal bunt
survey contained spores similar in size and shape to those of the
agent that causes Karnal bunt. Such spores were recovered in
samples from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Tennessee. Wheat
seed contaminated with these spores also was planted in South
Carolina.
"At this time we are no longer considering taking further
regulatory action in the Southeast," said Michael V. Dunn,
assistant secretary for marketing and regulatory programs.
In the near future, USDA will publish a standard for determining
the presence of Karnal bunt that will apply to all parts of the
country.
"Establishing this standard will ensure that all U.S. wheat
producers and handlers are treated equitably with regard to
Karnal bunt and that U.S. wheat has necessary certification to
remain competitive in global markets," said Dunn.
"These actions are consistent with USDA's objective to protect
the U.S. wheat industry while limiting restrictions to areas
where Karnal bunt disease occurs," said Dunn.
