Occurrence of _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_ Pathotype 5 on Squash in Italy.
------------------------------------------------------------
C Cappelli and R Buonaurio, Dipartimento di Arboricoltura e Protezione
delle Piante. Borgo XX Giugno, 74 06121 Perugia, Italy; and VM Stravato,
Genista s.r.l., via Flacca, 04022 Fondi (Latina), Italy. Plant Dis. 87:449,
2003; published on-line as D-2003-0204-01N, 2003. Accepted for publication

During the period May to August 2002, typical symptoms of downy mildew were
observed on squash (_Cucurbita pepo_ L.) in both tunnel and open-field
cultivation in central Italy (Latium and Umbria). The disease spread
rapidly and, because the control measures used were not effective, growers
suffered severe yield losses. Previous observations of downy mildew in
Italy suggested that squash was not susceptible (1).
Infected plants showed yellow spots on the upper leaf surface. Based on
morphological features, the pathogen was identified as _Pseudoperonospora
cubensis_ [Pc] (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Rostovzev.
To verify the pathogenicity of the fungus, a Pc suspension (10 000
sporangia per ml) was sprayed on leaves of squash plants with 2 expanded
leaves, which were maintained in dark moist chambers at 20 +/- 2 deg C for
48 h. Control plants were sprayed with sterile water. All plants were kept
in a growth chamber at 24 +/- 2 deg C with 14/10 h day/night cycles.
Chlorotic spots and sporulation were observed on inoculated plants. The
morphological features of Pc obtained from inoculated plants were identical
to those from the original diseased plant.
Physiological specialization among isolates of Pc based on the
compatibility of different cucurbit hosts (2) was not tested previously in
Italy. The pathotypes of 4 fungal isolates obtained from squash grown in
different localities were determined by inoculating 10 plants per species
of the cucurbit species (2) as previously described for pathogenicity tests.
Disease symptoms were detected on all inoculated hosts, including squash,
suggesting that all fungal isolates obtained from squash are pathotype 5.
Only pathotype 5 is a common causal agent of downy mildew of squash and
other cucurbit hosts.
Climatic conditions were unusually wet because frequent storms occurred
during the summer, providing favorable environmental conditions for the
development of secondary spread.
Unfortunately, no commercially acceptable cultivars of squash resistant to
downy mildew are available to growers in Italy.

[Downy mildew is a significant constraint to production of cucurbits
(primarily cantaloupe, cucumber, gourds, muskmelon, squash,
and watermelon) in production areas worldwide. The disease is usually
confined to leaves, but the quality and taste of fruits on infected plants
are adversely affected. Disease induction is favored by high humidity.
Management of the disease involves use of resistant cultivars, fungicides,
and cultural practices that promote good aeration and soil
drainage. -Mod.DH]
