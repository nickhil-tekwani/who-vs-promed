The 2 reports and moderator's comments emphasize the importance of hospital
hygiene and the overuse of antibiotics in the development of antibiotic
resistance and superbug infections, especially in hospital settings. Is
this a common trend in hospitals around the world? Such infections in some
countries appear to be associated more with the use of antibiotics in
livestock, especially poultry, leading to antibiotic resistance. Infected
and contaminated poultry meat can be a source [of] superbug infection in
humans, but how significant is this in the overall superbug problem in
humans compared with nosocomial transmission in hospitals?

[Dr Krishnan brings up the third variable in the equation - antimicrobials
in animal food. There is no doubt that in some settings related to
antimicrobial resistance, the use of antimicrobials in animal feed plays a
role (such as quinolone resistance of salmonella or campylobacter organisms
acquired by contact with undercooked poultry). We do not know any of the
circumstances of this case, and if it was a community-acquired VISA without
any contact with hospital flora, then the issue is more relevant here. The
following references were part of a recent supplement involving the field
of antimicrobial use and resistance in animals:

The use of antimicrobials, whether therapeutic or not, imposes selective
pressure that results in proliferation of resistant organisms. Where does
resistance originate? How is it maintained and disseminated? How much is
attributed to different sources (such as food animals, nosocomial)? Most
importantly, how do we control it? There is no clear single answer to each
of these questions. The problem is multi-faceted. I wish to add a few
important points relating to the United States food animal aspects.
It is important to divide the issue into the US and non-US (continental
Europe) if it involves the use of glycopeptides in animals. There is no
glycopeptide use for swine (or any other food animal) health and production
purposes in the US. Therefore, any VISA (vancomycin-intermediate _Staph.
aureus_), GISA (glycopeptide-intermediate _Staph. aureus_), or VRE
(vancomycin resistant enterococci) infections acquired in the US could not
have a direct link with glycopeptide use in animals.
Previous reports of VRE have emphasized that the VRE so far detected in the
US is limited to nosocomial origin. In Europe, where the glycopeptide
avoparcin (cross-resistant with vancomycin) was used for food animal
purposes until several years ago, a potential for the development and
dissemination of VISA may exist. However, the role of hospitals as the
origin and spread of such resistant organisms is still expected to be very
significant, as _Staph. aureus_ is a major nosocomial pathogen.
Often the impact of other factors that do not directly relate to
antimicrobial use, such as foreign travel, need to be seriously considered
further, with emphasis on the fact that the issue is global. Recent studies
in salmonella (Molbak K, et al. Increasing quinolone resistance in
Salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis. Emerg Infect Dis 2002; 8: 514-15
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol8no5/01-0288.htm>) and campylobacter
(Smith KE, et al. Quinolone resistant Campylobacter jejuni infections in
Minnesota, 1992-1998. N Engl J Med 1999; 340: 1525-32) clearly showed that
foreign travel is the most significant factor strongly associated with
dissemination of quinolone-resistant organisms. Molbak's finding in Denmark
clearly shows that, despite the banning of quinolone use, there is
increasing quinolone-resistant _Salmonella enteritidis_ infection in humans
associated with foreign travel. This has serious implications; although
resistance has been developed because of use, the reverse may not
necessarily be true.
In general, in my opinion, the resistance problem has 4 major aspects:
origin, expansion of spectrum, maintenance in the population, and
dissemination to other populations. An antimicrobial resistance gene,
penicillinase (currently called beta-lactamase), was first identified, even
before penicillin was introduced for clinical use (Abraham EP, Chain E. An
enzyme from bacteria able to destroy penicillin. Nature 1940; 3713: 837).
However, other important phenotypes, such as tetracycline resistance, have
been found early after use began in _Shigella_ spp. (a strictly human
pathogen) in 1953 (Falkow S. The genetic properties of R-factors.
Infectious multiple drug resistance. London: Pion, 1975: pp.58-75), which
was then disseminated to foodborne pathogens and is currently one of the
commonest phenotype among important foodborne pathogens such as salmonella
collected from swine (Gebreyes WA, et al. Antimicrobial resistance of
Salmonella isolates from swine. J Clin Microbiol 2000; 38: 4633-6).
The best weapons currently available to curb global problems of
antimicrobial resistance are prudent use of antimicrobials (both in human
and veterinary medicine, pathogen reduction, standardized surveillance, and
research towards identification of new antimicrobial agents). These are
suggested by the Interagency Task Force in 2000
<http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/actionplan/> and expand these
recommendations to fit the global need.

[I recently met with Dr James Steele, emeritus professor at The University
of Texas School of Public Health at Houston and an internationally known
expert in the field of zoonoses. He asked me to I share some information
with ProMED-mail subscribers on the current position of the American
Veterinary Medical Association with respect to antibiotic use in cattle. If
I've erred in stating the position below, it is my error in transcribing
what Dr Steele said, and not his.
Antibiotics in cattle feed
--------------------------
The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) position on the use of
antibiotics in veterinary practice clearly states that antibiotic use
should be confined to animals that are ill and should be used in a
judicious way.
The definition of judicious use does NOT include the use of antibiotics in
animals that are dying and headed for the market. Dr Steele raised the
issue that all antibiotic use in veterinary practice should be under
veterinary prescription. He stated that he suggested this 50 years ago, but
the regulations never materialized because of industry opposition, and the
courts agreed that it would be a restriction of interstate commerce.
Today, 50 years later, Dr Steele still believes that antibiotics should be
under veterinary prescription with restrictions for humane and health reasons.
The implementation of this would help insure that veterinary services were
available in areas that currently do not have practitioners. There are
about 75 000 veterinarians in the US. Dr Steele mentioned that this policy
was being supported by high-level government officials as well. - Mod.MPP]
