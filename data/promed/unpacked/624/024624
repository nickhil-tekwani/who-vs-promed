[HPAI H5N8 has now been detected in Lithuania. The virus is being detected wherever these wild birds migrate. Poultry producers, small and large alike, need to implement all the necessary biosecurity measures to protect their flocks from exposure and infection.

For this new HPAI event from Russia, the neuraminidase has not yet been determined. There is a high likelihood that these new cases are caused by HPAI H5N8. However, given the HPAI H5N5 that have been detected since November 2016 in various European countries (Croatia, Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, Greece, Montenegro and Czech Republic), determining the subtype and strain of this virus is important and requested.

H5N8 HPAI outbreaks officially reported in Asia, Europe and Africa by onset date, since [1 Jan 2017], can be seen at (last update [15 Feb 2017] (http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/H5N8/img/map1_2017_02_15.jpg.)
