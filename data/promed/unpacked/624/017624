[In fact, the epizootic currently reported from Russia is composed of 2 distinct epizootics, separated by thousands of kilometers and caused by FMDV serotype A of 2 genetically different genotypes. One epizootic started in early June 2013 in southwest Russia, northeast of the Black Sea, bordering northern Georgia. It is caused by FMDV A Iran-05 lineage. So far, 6 outbreaks have been reportedly caused by this strain in Russia, namely in the Karachay-Cherkess Republic, Krasnodar Territory, and Kabardino-Balkar Republic. FMDV A Iran-05 lineage is the main type involved in the epizootics circulating in West Eurasia. Type A has predominated this year [2013] in Iran and Turkey (see ProMED-mail post 20130710.1818136).

The other epizootic, to which the new outbreak reported in the current follow-up report no 13 belongs, started on 24 Jun 2013 in Amur (Siberia), on the border with China, caused by FMDV serotype A, topotype Asia, genotype/strain SEA 97, which is the same strain as the one reportedly circulating in China since the end of 2012. So far, 7 outbreaks have been reported, in the territories of Amur and Zabaykalsky. An earlier event in Zabaykalsky Territory, caused by the same strain, took place in March-April 2013, including 4 outbreaks caused by the same strain(see summary, with map, at http://tinyurl.com/nwv2o62).

The same FMDV-A virus strain has already spread, apparently from China, to east Kazakhstan and, very recently, to the far eastern part of Mongolia (see, with map, at http://tinyurl.com/p67ksu4).

Both FMD-stricken territories in Russia and Mongolia border China; however, no reports on FMD from China's neighbouring provinces have been published so far. For a map of worldwide FMD outbreaks, see http://tinyurl.com/otcdpnq (select FMD and zoom-in to the relevant zone). - Mod.AS
