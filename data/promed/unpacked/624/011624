[The success of Tunisia's ambitious plans to regain FMD-free status depends, on top of the local contingency and prevention programs, on the evolving situation in the neighbouring countries, namely Libya and Algeria.

In contrast to Tunisia, only cattle have been vaccinated in Algeria; the virus may continue its circulation there, within and between the unvaccinated sheep flocks.

The quality of the vaccines applied in both countries and in Libya and their potency to protect the ruminant population against the emerging O/ME-SA/Ind2001 strains, is of the highest importance.
