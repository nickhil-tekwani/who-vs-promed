Stem-rust disease is spreading
------------------------------
Interview with David Hodson, International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT):

"The original [Ug99] race has now grown to 13; it's a very closely related family of stem-rust races. The movement of the disease into Egypt was just confirmed. Using samples from 2014, 3 Ug99 races were identified. That event is potentially quite significant, not only for Egyptian wheat production, but for the potential of the disease to now spread into the Mediterranean basin.

"We're looking at a distribution now across 13 confirmed countries. From Egypt all the way down to South Africa, every wheat-growing country in eastern and southern Africa has confirmed an Ug99 race.

"From Egypt the most likely path would be eastward into Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Turkey. But if the disease gets established there, it could circulate around the Mediterranean, helped by winds or human migration. We could potentially see a much wider dispersal."

[Wheat stem rust is caused by the fungus _Puccinia graminis_ f. sp. _tritici_. Overall yield losses of up to 80 per cent are reported, but some fields are totally destroyed. New races are emerging, and the most dangerous at present is considered to be strain Ug99 (discovered in Uganda in 1999), which has overcome the major resistance gene Sr31 used in our current wheat varieties.

Since then Ug99 has spread and even more virulent variants of the original which are able to overcome additional resistance genes, have emerged. A new source of Ug99 strains was reported in South Africa in 2009 opening up additional routes of transmission and increasing the threat in the southern hemisphere (ProMED-mail post 20100602.1834). However, new strains not related to Ug99 are also posing a danger, for example, in Ethiopia (ProMED-mail post 20140327.2360315).

Stem rust spores are spread by wind and with infected straw or other contaminated materials. Some grasses or volunteer wheat may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum for the next cropping season. Disease management may include fungicide applications, control of volunteer wheat and resistant varieties if available. Breeding programmes have been set up in international collaboration (Delhi Declaration) to establish wheat varieties resistant to Ug99 strains. The possibility of Ug99 strains developing additional fungicide resistances can also not be excluded and such strains would be even more difficult to control.
