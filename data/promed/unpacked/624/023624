FDA posts press releases and other notices of recalls and market withdrawals from the firms involved as a service to consumers, the media, and other interested parties. FDA does not endorse either the product or the company.

nSpired Natural Foods, Inc. is voluntarily recalling certain retail lots of Arrowhead Mills Peanut Butters, MaraNatha Almond Butters and Peanut Butters and specific private label nut butters (listed below) packaged in glass and plastic jars because they have the potential to be contaminated with _Salmonella_.

The potential risk was brought to the company's attention by the FDA following routine testing. The company has received reports of 4 illnesses that may be associated with these specific products.

[Recalled Retail Lots with description, unit size, UPC code and best used by date range can be found at the original URL. The list includes products of the following brands:
- Arrowhead Mills
- MaraNatha
- Kroger
- Safeway
- Trader Joe's
- Whole Foods

The use-by date can be found on the top of the jar lid. The company is currently working with customers and retailers to remove and destroy products with the above use-by dates from store shelves and warehouses.

The recall is being made with the knowledge of the FDA.

[In the past, ProMED has reported on 3 separate outbreaks of peanut butter-associated salmonellosis in the USA. Each was related to a different serotype of _S._ enterica_, Typhimurium, Tennessee and Bredeney. The serotype or serotypes involved here are not stated.

As reported in Burnett SL, Gehm ER, Weissinger WR, Beuchat LR: Survival of Salmonella in peanut butter and peanut butter spread. J Appl Microbiol. 2000;89:472-477, with its abstract below, salmonellae can persist in peanut butter products but longer in traditional peanut butter than the so-called natural product.

Abstract
In 1996, the 1st documented outbreak of salmonellosis associated with the consumption of peanut butter was reported. This study was undertaken to determine survival characteristics of high (5.68 log10 cfu g(-1)) and low (1.51 log10 cfu g(-1)) inocula of a 5-serotype mixture of Salmonella in 5 commercial peanut butters and 2 commercial peanut butter spreads. Populations in samples inoculated with 5.68 log10 cfu g(-1) and stored for 24 weeks at 21 or 5 C [69 or 41 F] decreased 4.14-4.50 log10 cfu g(-1) and 2.86-4.28 log10 cfu g(-1), respectively, depending on the formulation. The order of retention of viability was: peanut butter spreads over traditional (regular) and reduced sugar, low-sodium peanut butters over natural peanut butter. Differences in rates of inactivation are attributed to variation in product composition as well as size and stability of water droplets in the colloidal matrix, which may influence nutrient availability. With the exception of natural peanut butter, products initially inoculated with 1.51 log10 cfu of Salmonella g(-1) (32 cfu g(-1)) were positive for the pathogen after storage for 24 weeks at 5 C. At 21 C, however, with the exception of one peanut butter spread, all products were negative for Salmonella after storage for 24 weeks. Post-process contamination of peanut butter and spreads with Salmonella may to result in survival in these products for the duration of their shelf life at 5 C and possibly 21 C, depending on the formulation. - Mod.LL
