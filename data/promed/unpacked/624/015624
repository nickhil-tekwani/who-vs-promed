'Killer' Australian flu strain set to spread across UK, experts warn
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Experts are warning that the current outbreaks of
flu are expected to intensify in the new year
[2009] as the Australian strain that can be fatal
spreads across the UK. The current flu epidemic
-- already on course to be the worst for 8 years
-- will get worse as the infection usually peaks
between January and March, they warn.

The European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS)
says the H3N2 Brisbane 10 flu strain that caused
a severe epidemic and killed 6 children in
Australia is spreading -- with the UK, Ireland,
Bulgaria and Spain experiencing it at "medium
intensity." The UK Health Protection Agency and
the Royal College of GPs have reported a sharp
rise in the number of flu-like illnesses over the
past 2 weeks, with pensioners being the worst-hit.

The sharp rise left the NHS struggling to cope
over Christmas. Thousands of GPs' surgeries close
over this period, leaving sufferers with nowhere
to go for help except accident and emergency
wards. But hospitals are already under more
pressure than usual because of outbreaks of the
winter vomiting bug norovirus. Latest figures
show that among the over-65s, 45 in every 100 000
people now have flu, up from just 18 a week ago.
Though it is still the 15 to 44 age group who are
reporting the most cases, with a rate of 80 per
100 000, it is the elderly who are most likely to die from flu.

This year's [2008] outbreak, blamed on an
Australian strain of the virus called Brisbane
H3N2, is well on course to be the worst since
1999, when 22 000 people died. However, an
outbreak does not officially become an epidemic
until the rate is higher than 200 per 100 000.
The last time this happened was in 1989.

Professor Steve Field, chairman of the Royal
College of GPs, said: "Older age groups are now
showing increases, and they have the most serious
consequences -- the extra load on the lungs,
possible viral pneumonia and the increased risk
of contracting a 2nd bacterial infection. The NHS
is coping remarkably well in the circumstances,
although there are some very desperate problems
in the West Midlands. The outbreak is affecting
young adults and many of these are health service
workers. When added together, there are a lot of
problems. The influenza vaccination programme has
been good in some areas but patchy in others. It
is these areas where the NHS will take a big hit."

John Heyworth, incoming president of the College
of Emergency Medicine, said most people with flu
would not need to see a health professional and
would be fine within 2 or 3 days. But he added:
"The bottom line is that if people can't access
care in the community and need to see someone,
they should come to accident and emergency
because we don't want bad things to happen. If
there is any doubt, we are happy to help."

The Health Protection Agency said: "Although it
is too early to predict how much further flu will
increase, the agency's advice is to be alert to
symptoms. These can include a headache, fever,
cough, sore throat, and aching muscles and
joints. For the majority of people, flu is an
unpleasant, but not life-threatening, illness.
But it can be dangerous for certain groups, such
as the elderly or those with heart problems,
diabetes or asthma and those who are immuno-compromised."

David Nicholson, NHS Chief Executive, said:
"Thanks to the extra resources, staff and
hospital capacity we've put in over the last 10
years, along with better planning, the NHS is well prepared for winter."

[To put this press report in perspective, current statements on
influenza surveillance in Europe are appended below.

o From Health Protection Report, Vol.2, no 51, 19
Dec 2008 (<http://www.hpa.org.uk/hpr/>):

"Influenza activity has started earlier this
season compared to recent years. Epidemiological,
clinical and virological indicators show that
influenza viruses are circulating in the
community at moderate levels. Infuenza is now
widespread across parts of the UK and continues to increase.

The percentage of ILI (Influenza-like illnesses)
cases with laboratory confirmed influenza through
GP sentinel schemes in England and Wales exceeded
the threshold of 30 percent in week 48 and is
currently at 50.6 percent. A total of 403 samples
have tested positive for influenza in the
Respiratory Virus Unit (RVU) influenza reference
laboratory at the HPA's Centre for Infections
(CfI) since week 40. The vast majority of
circulating influenza has been influenza A(H3)
with 359 (89.1 percent) isolates. A further 34
(8.4 percent) influenza A(H1) and 10 (2.5
percent) influenza B isolates have been detected.
All 42 A(H3) isolates tested since week 40/08
have been sensitive to oseltamivir and zanamivir
but resistant to amantadine. Of the 28 A(H1)
specimens tested, 27 are resistant to oseltamivir
but sensitive to zanamivir and amantadine.
Viruses characterised at RVU show that the
current seasonal influenza vaccine is well
matched to circulating strains and should provide
good protection. The number of influenza positive
detections from other NHS and HPA laboratories in
England and Wales has increased in the past few
weeks and almost doubled from week 49 to week 50.
Similar patterns have been seen in Scotland and Northern Ireland."

o From the EISS Weekly Electronic bulletin, Week 51, 25 Dec 2008
(<http://www.eiss.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi>):

"Epidemiological situation -- week 51/2008: For
the intensity indicator, the national network
levels of influenza-like illness (ILI) and/or
acute respiratory infection (ARI) were high in
Portugal and medium in Bulgaria, Ireland, Spain
and the UK (England and Northern Ireland). The
remaining 16 countries providing data reported
low intensity with increasing trends in Denmark,
France, Germany, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland.
For the geographical spread indicator, widespread
influenza activity occurred in Portugal and the
UK (England and Northern Ireland), while regional
activity was reported in Spain and the UK (Wales)
and local activity in France and Switzerland.
Sporadic activity was observed in 10 countries
while no activity was reported in Estonia,
Greece, Hungary, Poland and Romania. Definitions
for the epidemiological indicators can be found here.

Cumulative virological situation Â­ 2008-2009
season (weeks 40-51/2008): Of 2026 virus
detections (sentinel and non-sentinel) since week
40/2008, 1929 were type A (838 subtype H3, 55
subtype H1 and 1036 not subtyped) and 97 were type B.

Based on the antigenic and/or genetic
characterisation of 234 influenza viruses, 206
were reported as A/Brisbane/10/2007 (H3N2)- like,
16 as A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1)-like, 8 as
B/Malaysia/ 2506/2004-like (B/Victoria/2/87
lineage) and 4 as B/Florida/4/2006- like (B/Yamagata/16/88 lineage).

42 A(H3N2) viruses have been tested for antiviral
susceptibility so far this season; all those
tested were sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors
(42 for oseltamivir, 40 for zanamivir) and
resistant to the M2 inhibitor amantadine (40). Of
29 A(H1N1) viruses tested, all were sensitive to
zanamivir and 28 were resistant to oseltamivir,
whilst all of the 19 tested against amantadine
were sensitive. Both B viruses tested have been
sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors (one was
tested against both zanamivir and oseltamivir and
one against oseltamivir only). But for 2
oseltamivir resistant A(H1N1) viruses from
Norway, all other viruses tested have been from the UK."

While the situation in the UK is becoming
serious, there seems little justification for the
expression 'killer' employed by the above press report. - Mod.CP]
