Victorian health authorities, investigating an outbreak of the skin
infection Bairnsdale ulcer, will collect samples from the affected region
at Point Lonsdale. A 7th case of the rare disease was noted last week [3rd
week of July 2004].
Bairnsdale ulcer causes chronic ulcers to develop on the body, and, may
require surgical removal if not detected early. Samples, taken from
possible sources of the infection, will include water, plants, mosquitoes,
and march flies.
Dr. Rosemary Lester, from the Department of Human Services, says that the
testing is merely exploratory, and results will take several weeks.
"Because we don't fully understand what causes this, it's hard to design an
intervention to prevent any further cases, but, by going down there, having
a look, doing some sampling, we're hoping to learn all we can, so,
hopefully, we can prevent future cases," she said.
