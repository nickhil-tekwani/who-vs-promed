Encephalitis cases found in Dallas County horses
---------------------------------------------
Alabama Department of Public Health officials have confirmed there have been 4 positive cases of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) found in horses in Dallas County. The officials said there have been additional reports of cases in horses in Elmore and Montgomery counties, but those cases have not been confirmed [yet] by laboratory tests.

Health officials say EEE is transmitted by mosquitoes after they feed on birds. The same mosquitoes can then infect mammals, particularly humans and horses.

ADPH confirms Eastern Equine Encephalitis cases in horses in Dallas County
-----------------------------------------
The Alabama Department of Public Health has confirmed 4 positive cases of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) in horses located in Dallas County. There have been additional reports of cases in horses in Elmore and Montgomery counties; however, laboratory confirmation has not been performed.

Dr. Dee W. Jones, State Public Health Veterinarian, warns that the same mosquitoes that infect animals pose a risk to humans. The confirmation of viral activity is very common in the summer and fall months. Positive case counts in the state vary from year to year based on mosquito populations. The virus can only be spread through the bite of a mosquito, and not from another animal.

"With many people enjoying outdoor activities, it is important that residents take every effort to reduce their exposure to mosquitoes," Jones said. "Keep your mosquito repellent with you at all times when you are working or participating in recreational activities outdoors."

EEE, WNV and other mosquito-borne viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes after they feed on birds. The same mosquitoes can then infect mammals, particularly humans and horses. Humans and horses can sometimes become seriously ill from the infection. Transmission to humans and horses can be decreased by persons taking steps to avoid mosquitoes and by the use of EEE vaccines in horses. According to Jones, although there is no vaccine available for humans, vaccination for horses is very important in preventing infection in these animals.

[While there was a drought in the west and central parts of the state, there were adequate rains to provide mosquitoes. It will be an interesting summer.
