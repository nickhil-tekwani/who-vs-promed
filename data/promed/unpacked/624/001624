Malaysia dengue death toll up to 62
-----------------------------------
With 25 000 cases of dengue fever reported in Malaysia during January and February of 2015, the country appears on a trajectory to see more cases than last year's [2014] 100 000. In addition, the Malaysia Health Ministry has put the death toll due to dengue at 62, up 8 in less than a week. In 2013, Malaysia reported 79 fatalities, while last year [2014], at least 189 deaths were counted.

Selangor continues to report the most cases in the country at nearly 15 000, or 6 out of 10 cases nationwide.

In the past 50 years, the incidence of dengue worldwide has increased 30-fold, largely as a consequence of the growth of cities and increased travel.

Dengue fever is an infectious disease carried by mosquitoes and caused by any of 4 related dengue viruses. This disease used to be called "break-bone fever" because it sometimes causes severe joint and muscle pain that feels like bones are breaking. People get the dengue virus from the bite of an infected _ Aedes_ mosquito. It is not contagious from person to person. There are 3 types of dengue fever in order of less severe to most: the typical uncomplicated dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHS), and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there may be 50-100 million dengue infections worldwide every year. However, new research from the University of Oxford and the Wellcome Trust, using cartographic approaches, estimate there to be 390 million dengue infections per year worldwide.

[Predictive computer models have been developed to determine more accurately a 'threshold' limit for epidemic risk in a particular locale. One model considers local levels of population immunity to the 4 dengue serotypes, as well as vector densities and ambient temperature, to yield a calculation of the threshold number of _Aedes_ pupae/per person or pupae/per area. The risk of a dengue epidemic is considered low when the number is below the threshold; risk increases sharply above the threshold (http://www.who.int/heli/risks/vectors/denguecontrol/en/).

Ho Chi Minh City and southern provinces are battling an unseasonal spread of dengue fever, with thousands of cases reported including 3 deaths last month [February 2015]. Statistics from the Ministry of Health show that the country has recorded more than 5200 infections so far this year [2015], including 3640 infections in February, mostly in the south. The 3 dead patients were from Dong Nai and Long An, both neighboring HCMC [Ho Chi Minh City].

There have been 27 per cent more cases than in the same period last year [2014], when there was only 1 death.

Dengue fever is a tropical disease spread by mosquitoes, with symptoms including high fever and joint pain. According to WHO, severe cases need to be treated as soon as possible to avoid lethal complications.

Dr Phan Trong Lan, head of the Pasteur Institute in Ho Chi Minh City, said the beginning of the year used to be the low season of dengue fever. But experts have detected high concentration of the virus since late last year [2014] in HCMC and nearby provinces.

Doctors at HCMC Children's Hospital no 1 just saved a 7 year old boy from Long An who suffered respiratory failure and liver damage after having high fever for 3 days. They had to put him on a respirator and provided blood transfusion for more than a week.

Doctors said parents should watch out for abnormal conditions in their children to send them to hospital early. Viet Nam reports an average 100 000 dengue fever cases including 100 fatal cases each year. Most of the victims are children.

The country has been testing a dengue fever vaccine provided by Sanofi Pasteur, a division of the multinational pharmaceutical company Sanofi.

[As detailed in the WHO handbook for clinical management of dengue, "the clinical management of dengue is more fraught than that of most other infectious tropical diseases. The uninitiated physician who has managed uncomplicated dengue cases may be lulled into believing that dengue is a 'mild disease of thrombocytopenia' that requires no more than intravenous fluid therapy and platelet transfusions for a couple of days.

When faced with severe dengue, these same physicians may be unprepared for the changing clinical, biochemical, and haematological profiles that accelerate after the 1st few days of fever and therefore will not step up their vigilance during the critical period."

Some 34 of the common pitfalls in dengue management with their explanations for the misconceptions, together with suggested solutions, were identified at different stages of disease progression, including those for frontline physicians (5); at emergency department (2); for shock and its many manifestations (7); for parenteral fluid therapy (5); for urine output (8); and lastly for blood transfusion for severe bleeding (7)
(http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/76887/1/9789241504713_eng.pdf).

Alongside relevant preventive measures, including preemptive distribution of Abate larvicide and health education, refresher training on dengue case management should be regularly provided to physicians, ranging from those in the outpatient department to those who are specifically dealing with inpatients.
