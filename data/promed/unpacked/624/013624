In Bijapur district (state of Karnataka), long dry spells, unseasonal rains, and hailstorms coupled with blight, a bacterial disease, have made tending to grapes a nightmarish experience. The farmers have [turned] to the lucrative pomegranate, which again had its share of blight attack last year [2017].

The resultant drop in yield and also frequent crashes in prices of the 2 main fruits cultivated in the district have forced farmers to look to the government for support.

[Although bacterial blights seem to be implicated in this report, it is not clear how this statement has been arrived at. A number of diseases caused by other pathogens, such as fungi and viruses, are also known to occur on both crops in the region. Reliable diagnosis of the cause(s) is essential before any management strategies can be designed.

For grapevine, only a few bacterial diseases have been reported, including xylella leaf scorch (Pierces disease; _Xylella fastidiosa_) and a bacterial blight caused by _Xylophilus ampelinus_. The latter may be the problem referred to above.

For pomegranate, the disease referred to may be oily spot (also called bacterial blight, black spot) caused by _Xanthomonas axonopodis_ (Xa) pv. _punicae_. It is considered an epidemic and a threat to the industry in parts of India, with up to 85 per cent incidence in the north of Karnataka (for example, see ProMED-mail posts 20140430.2439412 and 20150730.3546876).

Bacterial pathogens are often spread by infected plant material (including fruit, twigs, and cuttings), mechanical means (including insect and human activities), and wind-splashed rain. Disease management may include use of clean planting material, phytosanitary measures, and bactericidal sprays.
