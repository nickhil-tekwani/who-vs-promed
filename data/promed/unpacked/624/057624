ANTHRAX, HUMAN - GEORGIA (WESTERN)

Paata Imnadze, head of the National Center for Disease Control,
reported that so far this year [2007], 15 human cases of anthrax have
been registered in Georgia. Normally 30-40 cases of anthrax are
registered annually in Georgia. Recently 3 inhabitants of western
Georgia are under medical care on suspicion of anthrax. In one case
the diagnosis has been already excluded; 2 persons have been
hospitalized in Zugdidi and Kutaisi where they continue to be
medically monitored.
Paata Imnadze reminds the population that within the framework of the
state program vaccination of cattle is available free-of-charge. He
also has warned the population of the necessity, when cattle die, and
anthrax is suspected, to immediately bury the animals in specially
designated places and not try to keep the animal hides.

[One of a series of ongoing problems with anthrax in the old Soviet
countries is that only human cases get reported with any frequency.
The veterinary services are largely silent, whatever the reality on
the ground. With the exception of Africa, where rural poverty ensures
that any bovine anthrax case may feed a village and certainly a
family, elsewhere there will be dead cattle that are not butchered
for human food. But obviously it does happen and, unfortunately not
infrequently, as in this instance in western Georgia. By the
government response emphasizing the public health aspects, it in turn
downplays the greater necessity of properly controlling and
preventing this disease in livestock. At the risk of being boring and
repetitive, human cases of anthrax occur when veterinary services are
not effective. This is primarily a livestock disease, which acquires
human cases, largely through ignorance and greed. The latter are hard
to control but the livestock cases can be prevented through
vaccination and human exposure restricted through proper carcass
inspection and management. - Mod MHJ
