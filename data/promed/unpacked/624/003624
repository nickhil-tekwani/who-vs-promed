THE ELEVENTH PLAGUE: A NOVEL

John Marr, M.D., and John Baldwin have co authored "The Eleventh Plague", a
novel about medical terrorism. I have not finished reading the book and
would not review it anyway, as I have an apparent conflict of interest.
However, I would like to share with our subscribers the Preface:
"The Eleventh Plague, sui generis, is fiction. But the men and women of
the Federation of American Scientists, SatelLife and World Health
Organization, who created and continue to support the concept of
ProMED[-mail], are quite real. This book is dedicated to these scientists
and to ProMED-mail. ProMED-mail may be our best hope should fact follow
fiction."
The authors are generously donating a portion of their book advance to
ProMED-mail.
John Marr will be autographing copies of the book at a booth at the
International Conference on Emerging Infectious Diseases in Atlanta next
month.
"The eleventh Plague" is published by Harper Collins, New York. I
purchased a copy on-line via http:\\www.amazon.com.
I assume they will make this into a motion picture. I suggest Joe Pesci
for the Jack Woodall (Jack Bryne) role.
Do not send purchase orders or requests for copies of this book to either
ProMED-mail or to me. Pitchers and catchers have reported for spring
training and I have far too much to do to answer such requests. Besides, I
am trying to find out what "sui generis" means; I thought it was some sort
of pig.
