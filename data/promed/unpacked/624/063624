Queensland's AUD 360 million (approx. USD 276 million) prawn industry has been dealt another blow with news the troublesome white spot virus has spread into Moreton Bay.

Agriculture and Fisheries Minister Bill Byrne says the virus that causes the disease has been detected near the Redcliffe Peninsula and Deception Bay. Mr Byrne says the state government's established a movement control order to prevent its spread, which will be in place for 3 months to allow further testing before determining future action.

[White spot viral disease has caused high mortalities and severe damage to the shrimp culture industry in China, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia and India. The virus was 1st detected in Taiwan in 1992, and then it spread to Japan and almost all Asian countries. The 1st diagnosed case of WSVD in the Americas occurred in 1995 in a South Texas shrimp farm, and it was suggested that the most probable route for its introduction was through an Asian imported frozen-bait shrimp commodity. In February 1999, the virus caused massive mortalities in some farms in Ecuador, and the most recent outbreak occurred in Brazil last year (2016). Reports in Australia began in December 2016.

Acutely affected shrimps are reported to show a rapid reduction in food consumption, become lethargic and have a loose cuticle with white spots (hence, the name "White spot" disease) of 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, which are more apparent on the inside surface of the carapace (see http://www.smh.com.au/content/dam/images/g/t/k/v/a/2/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.gtkvca.png/1483356145795.jpg). The white spots represent abnormal deposits of calcium salts by the cuticular epidermis.
