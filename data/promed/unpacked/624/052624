A California importer is recalling smoked seafood imported from the
Philippines. Foremost Foods International, Inc. of Pomona California,
said it's pulling Pangasinan branded Roundscad Smoked Galunggong and
Mackerel Smoked Hasa Hasa sold in Washington, Nevada and California
through Seafood City and Manila Seafood stores.

The potentially contaminated seafood was distributed between March
2010 and October 2011 and sold in 6-oz. clear vacuum-packed plastic
packages. The recall follows a test by the FDA that turned up
_Clostridium botulinum_, the bacterium that [produces a neurotoxin
that] causes botulism.

The company said it has received no reports of illness.

[Galunggong is a very popular fish in the Philippines. In English the
galunggong fish has been known as the blue mackerel scad, round scad
or as the shortfin scad, but these names have been applied to other
fish of the Decapterus family as well. In the Philippines, Hasa Hasa
generally refers to a short-bodied mackerel.

Because of the potential severity of botulism, ProMED-mail posts such
recalls even if, as in this case, there are no human cases associated
with the food products. Most of the food recalls (as in these cases)
are related to defective preparation procedures, which could, but not
necessarily do, result in the germination of viable spores of _C.
botulinum_.

With fish, many recalls are related to the lack of evisceration. -
