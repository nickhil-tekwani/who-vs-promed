Here are a couple of press releases about our unfolding botulism outbreak.
There are now 8 hospitalized cases (at least 4 are stool confirmed), one of
whom was not at the suspect meal but had frozen chili from the same grocery
salvage store. A recall is now out about the frozen chili products
suspected of causing the illness. You can probably get the details of the
recall from the USDA website.
There is some information that this product was distributed to several states.
There are also at least 3 cases associated with the church meal who are
mildly symptomatic.

TDH News Release, 2 Sep 2001

Botulism Link Prompts TDH to Warn Consumers Not to Eat Sheriff Blaylock's
Chili
----------------------------------------------------
Laboratory tests by the Texas Department of Health (TDH) and the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) have linked an outbreak of botulism in
Sanger, north of Denton, to Sheriff Blaylock's brand chili purchased at
Town Talk Salvage in Fort Worth.
TDH officials say until further notice no one should eat Sheriff Blaylock's
chili regardless of where it was purchased and that no one should eat any
brand of chili purchased from Town Talk Salvage. Officials have not
determined how or where the chili became contaminated.
Anyone who has eaten Sheriff Blaylock's chili or any chili from the outlet
who experiences symptoms of botulism should seek immediate medical care.
6 persons who ate food prepared for a dinner after a 25 Aug choral practice
at the Holy Temple Church of God in Christ in Sanger are hospitalized with
botulism. Others at the event apparently became ill but had milder symptoms.
People who have quantities of the suspect chili on hand should keep it
frozen and contact their local health department or the nearest TDH
regional office for instructions.
TDH, FDA, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service and local
health departments are continuing to investigate.
The USDA is issuing a recall of Sheriff Blaylock's chili marked with lot
number 20861 and may expand the recall to other lot numbers as more
information becomes available.
For more information contact Doug McBride, TDH Public Information Officer
at 512-458-7524 or pager 1-877-813-7943.

TDH Investigating Possible Botulism Outbreak in Sanger
-------------------------------------------------------
Texas Department of Health (TDH) officials are investigating illnesses
believed to be botulism that have sent six people to hospitals in the
Dallas/Fort Worth area.
The six ate food prepared for an evening meal after a choir concert
Saturday at the Holy Temple Church of God and Christ in Sanger, a town
north of Denton.
TDH is advising anyone who ate food prepared for this event and has any of
these symptoms or experiences nausea, vomiting or an upset stomach to seek
medical care at a hospital emergency room. Health officials also warn that
people with leftover food from this event should not eat it. Instead they
are asked to keep the food refrigerated and call TDH's Arlington office at
817-264-4551 for instructions. Anyone who ate food at the Sanger event is
asked to call TDH's Arlington office to provide information that could help
in the investigation of the outbreak.
For more information contact Brad Walsh, TDH Arlington epidemiologist, at
817-264-4551; or Emily Palmer, TDH Assistant Public Information Officer, at
512-458-7400.

TDH Takes Action Against Fort Worth Store in Botulism Investigation
----------------------------------------------------------
Texas Department of Health (TDH) officials intensified efforts to control a
botulism outbreak by detaining all products at Town Talk, a Fort Worth
discount foods store, early today after learning that a second brand of
frozen chili purchased at the store was suspected in the hospitalization
late Monday of a Tarrant County resident with symptoms of the foodborne
illness.
TDH officials said the patient had eaten chili labeled "Texas Chili
Company, One-Step, Heat and Eat", purchased Aug. 24 at the Town Talk store
at Beach and 1st Streets in Fort Worth. They warned people not to eat any
brand of chili from Town Talk.
The TDH detainment means no products can be sold or removed from the store.
The early morning action was taken pending a decision later today on an
emergency order to totally shut down the store.
State, federal and local public health officials have been investigating an
outbreak of botulism that had caused 6 persons from the Sanger area to be
hospitalized after they ate chili purchased from Town Talk for a 25 Aug
meal served after a choral practice at a Sanger church. TDH officials
learned late Monday that a seventh person connected to the Sanger event
also has been hospitalized.
Health officials said the Tarrant County resident who was hospitalized is
not connected to the Sanger event. Since 28 Aug 2001, [a total of] 8
persons in North Texas -- 3 children and 5 adults -- have been hospitalized
with botulism symptoms.
Health officials earlier had associated the Sanger illnesses with Sheriff
Blaylock's Best Chili, manufactured by Classic Foods of Fort Worth, after
laboratory tests found high levels of botulism-causing toxins in an
unopened container of the chili purchased at the Town Talk store for the
Sanger church gathering. Laboratory tests are pending on the Texas Chili
Company brand chili, manufactured by First Original Texas Chili Company,
Inc., also of Fort Worth.
"At this point in our investigation, we don't know for sure where or how
contamination took place," said TDH regional director James Zoretic, M.D.,
Arlington. "But we have enough questions about Town Talk's operation to
detain their products. And to protect the public's health, we have to warn
people not to eat Sheriff Blaylock's or Texas Chili Company chili and not
to eat any brand of chili from Town Talk, until we know more."
Symptoms of botulism, a bacterial illness, can include vomiting, nausea,
upset stomach, blurred vision, dry mouth, difficulty swallowing or
speaking, general weakness and shortness of breath. Symptoms can occur from
6 hours to 10 days after eating contaminated food. Botulism can cause
paralysis, respiratory failure and death.
Anyone who has eaten either of the 2 brands of chili -- or any brand of
chili purchased from Town Talk -- and experiences symptoms of botulism
should seek immediate medical care.
On Monday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a recall of
two package codes -- 10861 and 20861 -- of the Sheriff Blaylock's brand
chili. No decision had been made early today about a recall of the Texas
Chili Company brand.
For more information contact James Zoretic, M.D., TDH Regional Director,
Arlington, at 817-264-4502; or Doug McBride, TDH Public Information
Officer, Austin, at 512-458-7524.
