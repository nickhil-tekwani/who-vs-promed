Epidemiological comments: No new outbreaks have been reported in the
country since August 2005; the disease has been always confined to
the western provinces. The recent occurrence has taken place in a
province in the central-eastern region, which remained free of this
disease. Since it was suspected, a disease emergency was declared in
this region and the neighbouring areas, and a disease alert [was
declared] in the entire country. The use of vaccines for protecting
populations at risk is not to be precluded.

Control measures: Measures applied

* Stamping out
* Quarantine
* Movement control inside the country
* Zoning
* Disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s)
* No vaccination
* No treatment of affected animals

Measures to be applied

[Since 2005, the only countries in the western hemisphere reporting
rabbit hemorrhagic disease are Uruguay, the United States and Cuba.
Cuba had 96 outbreaks in 2005, lasting from January through August;
however, they were confined to the western part of Cuba, and this new
outbreak is in the central eastern part of Cuba. See the map provided
with the OIE WAHID reference above or at Healthmap.org.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease is considered endemic in wild rabbits in
Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Cuba. For further overview
