BSE-affected ostrich, Germany
-----------------------------
Here is some information that might help to place the above-referenced
ProMED-mail posting in the appropriate context. I called the pathology
folks in Hanover to find out that the guy in charge (Prof. Pohlenz) is in
the US and that this issue was (indirectly) raised by Prof. Schoon, now in
the pathology department of the veterinary school at the University of
Leipzig. I called him and he explained to me that the story to which the
journalist of Die Zeit refers is not new.
We talked about 3 zoo ostriches which became sick and were examined
postmortem (I do not know whether they died or had been euthanized). The
examiners found typical spongiform lesions in the same areas in which
BSE-affected cows have holes. All this took place in the mid 1980s (quite
some while before the first official autochthonous BSE case in a cow hit
us) and was published in 1991 in 2 journals: Tieraerztliche Praxis and in
the Proceedings of the International Meeting on Disease of Zoo and Wildlife
Animals.
According to Prof. Schoon this was, and probably still is, the first
description of a spongiform encephalopathy in a bird. By the way, samples
back then had been sent to England and the experts there (back in those
days the only experts in Europe) were also fascinated by what they saw, but
obviously this information somehow got shelved until this reporter came to
interview Prof. Schoon. The main topic of this interview was the use of
ostriches in meat production, but somehow this old study was mentioned and
got back into circulation probably because the current pan-European BSE
crises still sells well in the yellow press.
I hope that helps provide some background for the ostrich story. I entirely
agree with you in that there should have been cases in England during the
last decade, but I do not know how many ostriches they are raising or how
the English feed their ostriches.

[Thanks to Martin for this rapid and full clarification. Whether the tissue
blocks still exist at Weybridge must be an open question. If they were sent
to the pathology department, I am sure they are there somewhere. If to the
old poultry department, it is less certain. This thread is cut. - Mod.MHJ
