Uganda: Ebola outbreak press statement -- 4 Jan 2008
----------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health wishes to update the general public on the
Ebola situation in the country. The cumulative total is 149 patients
with 37 deaths.
In Bundibugyo District, 5 people are currently admitted, one in Kikyo
Health Centre and 4 in Bundibugyo Hospital. Of these, one new
suspected case has been registered and is admitted in Bundibugyo
hospital in the last 24 hours. One patient was discharged from Kikyo
Health Centre. On a good note, 441 out of 771 contacts have completed
21 days of follow up and are considered safe.
The Ministry of Health continues to urge the public to avoid
unnecessary movements and gatherings especially in the districts
around Bundibugyo, that is, Kabarole, Kasese, Hoima, Kibaale,
Kyenjojo, Kamwenge, Ibanda, Bushenyi, and Mbarara.
As we end the festive season, all District Health Officers, in charge
of Health Units and the general public should not relax but continue
being on alert and immediately report any suspected cases. Similarly,
the public is reminded to report to Health Facilities any persons who
present with the following symptoms: very high fever of sudden onset,
diarrhoea, vomiting associated with red eyes, and a measles-like
rash. Ebola is spread by close contact with body fluids of infected
persons or people who have died of Ebola. Anybody handling suspected
cases must use appropriate protective wear and must wash his/her
hands thoroughly with soap and water or JIK [bleach] and water.
The Ministry assures the general public that the epidemic is still
confined in Bundibugyo district and is getting contained. The public
is urged to be compassionate and provide care and support to persons
that have been discharged. I wish to thank all those who have
provided support to the discharged patients. Let us continue. These
people are not infectious and therefore should not be discriminated
against.
The public should continue to be vigilant but without creating
unnecessary fear and panic. The Central Alert Team will continue to
respond to all alert cases brought to our attention. The numbers to
contact remain the same:
Police Mobile 111 or 999
Police control room, Ministry of Health, 0772 587567, 0414 345108.

[The cumulative number of Ebola hemorrhage fever cases in the
Bundibugyo District of Uganda is now given as 149 and the number of
deaths as 37. These figures are considerably greater than the 113
cases and 27 deaths declared by the Ugandan Health Ministry on 13 Dec
3007. No doubt some of this increase may be due to enhanced
surveillance and retrospective diagnosis, but it is unlikely that the
outbreak has been extinguished. Indeed some patients remain in
hospital and at least one is a new suspected case. - Mod.CP
In view of the fact that Ebola virus is only spread by contact with
the body fluids of an infected monkey or ape, or a human case who is
likely to be too sick to attend any gathering, the requirement to
avoid movements and gatherings seems excessive. - Mod.JW]
