[Even though the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic has been declared over
by WHO, this outbreak in swine should serve to remind us that swine
were also affected by the pandemic with human-to-swine being the most
likely route of infection in the reports listed below. Geographically,
it is worth noting that swine have been infected by novel H1N1 across
a wide swath of North America, Europe, and Asia. - Mod.PC]
