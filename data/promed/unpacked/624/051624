Health officials issue alert about rare sexually transmitted disease
-----------------------------------------------
San Francisco public health officials issued a warning, on Mon 20 Dec 2004,
that a rare and potentially debilitating sexually transmitted disease
reported recently in the Netherlands has turned up among a small number of
patients in the city.
Known as lymphogranuloma venereum, or LGV, the disease is a form of the
common sexually transmitted infection chlamydia, but this particular strain
can cause scarring of the genitals and colon, and can produce a swelling
and rupture of lymph glands near the groin.
Although the disease is seldom seen outside of poor, tropical nations,
doctors in Rotterdam reported 92 cases among gay men during a 17-month
period ending in September 2004. Isolated cases have also been reported in
Belgium, France, Sweden and Atlanta, GA (USA).
In November 2004, doctors at San Francisco's City Clinic treated a man with
the disease, and subsequent tests of stored specimens spotted 3 other cases
that occurred this summer [2004] but had gone undetected by conventional
screens. None of the 4 patients who were found to have the infection in San
Francisco had visited the Netherlands, an indication there may be other
cases yet to be discovered in the city, said Dr. Sam Mitchell, a Department
of Public Health epidemiologist.
The 4 cases in San Francisco were among gay men, some of whom also tested
positive for HIV. Mitchell said there is no indication that HIV-positive
patients are at higher risk for complications of LGV, but there is concern
that a patient with the chlamydia infection might be more prone to contract
HIV because of the ulceration caused by the bacteria.
Treating LGV successfully requires a 3-week course of antimicrobial agents,
instead of the single dose of medicine used to treat common strains of
chlamydia. Because it is difficult to distinguish early infections of LGV
from the more benign microbes, Mitchell said the city is recommending that
doctors treat all cases of rectal chlamydia with the 3 week regimen.
"We think doctors should err on the side of caution,'' he said.

[It is not known at this point whether the Dutch outbreak is related to
these cases.
The LGV organism gains entrance through skin breaks or abrasions, or
crosses the epithelial cells of mucous membranes. Traveling via the
lymphatics, it multiplies within mononuclear phagocytes in the regional
lymph nodes. Transmission is predominantly sexual. However, transmission by
fomites, nonsexual personal contact, and laboratory accidents has been
documented. The creation of aerosols has been associated with infection
associated with pulmonary symptoms.
The disease occurs in 3 stages. The majority of infections in the primary
and secondary stages may go undetected. The primary stage is marked by the
formation of a painless herpetiform ulceration at the site of inoculation.
The secondary stage classically is described as the inguinal syndrome, and
it is characterized by painful inguinal lymphadenitis and associated
constitutional symptoms:
Tender inguinal lymphadenopathy, usually unilateral, is the most common
clinical manifestation.
Heterosexual men are affected most often in the inguinal lymph nodes.
Homosexual men and women who are receptive to anal sex may develop
perirectal and pelvic lymph node involvement. In women, these nodes may be
involved as a result of lymphatic spread from the cervix and posterior
vaginal wall.
Suppurative granulomatous lymphadenitis and perilymphadenitis occur over
time with matting of the nodes. Frequently, these nodes coalesce to form
stellate abscesses. Histologically, these abscesses are nearly diagnostic,
but they may be similar to those seen in other infections, including cat
scratch fever and mycobacterial granulomatous infections.
The tertiary stage of LGV occurs years after the initial infection. In this
stage, an anogenitorectal syndrome may occur, with resultant rectal
stricture or elephantiasis of the genitalia. This syndrome is found
predominantly in women and homosexual men, because of the location of the
involved lymphatics. This late stage is characterized by proctocolitis,
which is caused by hyperplasia of intestinal and perirectal lymphatic
tissue. This inflammation forms perirectal abscesses, ischiorectal
abscesses, rectovaginal fistulas, anal fistulas, and rectal stricture. In
very late stages, fibrosis and granulomas are characteristic. Chlamydial
organisms are scarce at this stage. - Mod.LL]
