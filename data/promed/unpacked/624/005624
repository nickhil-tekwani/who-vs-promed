The Federal State Unitary Enterprise in Lukhovitsky area of Moscow region reported an outbreak of rabies in cattle. The farms include several thousand cows and 8 of them were found to have rabies. However, the farm is not yet closed and its products continue to be sold.

The sick animals were immediately isolated and euthanized. Local residents have panicked and are not buying milk or meat from the area, because they believe that cows are infected with "mad cow disease", or spongiform encephalitis, and the disease can be transmitted to humans by eating the meat of an infected animal.

Rosselkhoznadzor [Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] has denied these rumors and says the cows were infected with the conventional rabies; this virus [they claim] can be transmitted only by the bite of an infected animal.

[According to the veterinary services, 3 cases of rabies were confirmed on 11 Mar 2015 by veterinary laboratory tests. Infection of the cows most probably occurred after a contact with wild animals (foxes) in the open farmyard. In January 2015, Lukhovitsky area registered the 1st case of rabies in a bull over the past 10 years. - Mod.NR]

Russia provided the following statistics on the rabies situation in animals in the Moscow region since 2011 (number of outbreaks; in wildlife, dogs, cats -- number of rabid animals).
year / no. outbreaks / wildlife* / dogs* / cats*
2011 / 137 / 114 /27 / 20
2012 / 73 / - / 46 / 25
2013 / 37 / - / 29 / 11
2014 (January-June) / 4 / - / 4 / 1 [July-December not yet available]
* Number of cases

According to these statistics, wildlife rabies seems to have been controlled since 2012 (the option of deficient surveillance is less likely). A significant decrease of rabies incidence in dogs and cats has been reported.

When rabies is reported on a dairy cattle farm, several precautionary measures should be applied, their main aim being the prevention of direct exposure of personnel on farms and elsewhere (particularly slaughterhouses) to rabid animals. There is no risk in the consumption of milk derived from other cattle on such farm. Close veterinary observations on the farm should be maintained for at least 3 months.

For details on the (few) cases in herbivores (such as cattle) in the Moscow region since 2011, please refer to the OIE source at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (select country, rabies, and time-frame).

The unfortunate confusion between the terms 'BSE' and 'rabies' is based upon linguistics (I am told that "mad cow disease" and the vernacular for "rabies" may sound similar in Russian). - Mod.AS]

[The Russian name for BSE translates as "cow rabies". WHO says "Ingestion of raw meat or other tissues from animals infected with rabies is not a source of human infection." http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs099/en - Mod.JW
