Meningococcal disease in the Philippines - update
-----------------------------------------------
From 1 Oct 2004 to 16 Jan 2005, a total of 38 cases of meningococcal
disease and 18 deaths (case fatality ratio 47 percent) have been reported
from Baguio City, and a total of 40 cases and 12 deaths (case fatality
ratio 30 percent) have been reported from the Cordillera Region, excluding
Baguio City. Out of the total of 78 cases, 11 have been laboratory
confirmed for _N. meningitidis_ by the Baguio City Hospital and the
Research Institute for Tropical Medicine. Since 7 Jan 2005, the number of
weekly cases has decreased.
Current control measures include case management of suspect cases, active
surveillance and chemoprophylaxis of close contacts as well as vaccination
of health workers directly involved in case management. Further field
investigations to better understand the risk factors involved in the
transmission of this disease are planned.
WHO, with the assistance of partners in the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network (GOARN), is supporting the Department of Health,
Philippines in strengthening epidemiological surveillance, increasing
laboratory capacity for detection/confirmation of meningococcal disease,
and implementing additional epidemiological studies. The GOARN team is
composed of a meningococcal expert from the Institute de Medecine Tropicale
des Services de Sante des Armees (IMTSSA), Marseille, France, a laboratory
expert from the WHO Collaborating Centre, CCD, Atlanta, USA, an
epidemiologist from the Public Health Agency of Canada and an
epidemiologist from the European Programme for Intervention Epidemiology
Training.

Cold weather a big factor in "meningo" upsurge
-----------------------------------------------
Dr. Eric Bertherat, a meningococcemia expert of the WHO, said Baguio's
semi-temperate weather is a big factor in the upsurge of cases of the
dreaded bacterial disease since last October 2004.
Bertherat, whom the WHO sent to the country to help authorities address the
health problem, said cold weather is often associated with "outbreaks" of
meningococcemia. "Meningococcemia starts in early winter even in developed
countries," he said. "Cold weather brings influenza and other infections of
the respiratory tract." Bertherat and another WHO expert, Gerald Dziekan,
have been closely working with local authorities to stamp out the bacterial
infection or at least prevent an outbreak.
Health Secretary Manuel Dayrit has hinted that sporadic cases of
meningococcemia may arise elsewhere in the country, because its bacteria
(_Neisseria meningitidis_) are everywhere, unlike the avian flu virus.
This time of the year, Bertherat said, meningococcal outbreaks hit the so-
called "meningitis belt" in Africa. "In the meningitis belt, outbreaks can
affect about 250 000 people in 5 months. It usually starts this time of
year, when the evenings are very cold," he said.
In Burkina Faso, which is within the meningitis belt, the temperature can
dip to zero C, he said. Last year [2004], 8000 meningococcemia cases were
recorded there within a span of 5 months, he added.
Bertherat said a meningococcal epidemic is now raging in Chad, another
country in the African meningitis belt. He said the situation in Baguio is
nothing compared to that in other countries.
There have been no new admissions of suspected meningococcemia cases to the
Baguio General Hospital since 7 Jan 2005. Despite this, Dziekan said WHO is
thoroughly investigating the blood bacterial infection.
"We are taking the situation seriously, and our aim is to find out what is
going on here," he said. He said WHO lacks enough data on the meningoccocal
infection in the Philippines, adding that they don't know whether the
Baguio occurrence was normal or abnormal. "We will remain to assist the
Department of Health and other health officials," he said.

-----------------------------------------------
A 5-year-old child and an older person with suspected meningococcemia
disease have already been isolated in the Northern Mindanao Medical Center
(NMMC). According to reports, one of the victims came from one of the
hospitals in the city and was transferred to the NMMC on Sat 15 Jan 2005.
Aside from these 2, another 2 children from an El Salvador town in Misamis
Oriental were likewise believed to be suffering from meningococcemia and
have been admitted to the medical center.
