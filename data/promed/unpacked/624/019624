African swine fever detected in one area of Kabardino-Balkaria
--------------------------------------------------------------
The media center of the Ministry of Emergencies in Kabardino-Balkaria
reports that quarantine was imposed in the Mayskiy rayon of
Kabardino-Balkaria because of African swine fever [ASF] cases in the
Novo-Ivanovskoe settlement.

According to the report, 4 pigs died in the farm on 22 Mar 2010. The
specimens were sent to the interregional veterinary laboratory in
Stavropol and to the Russian Veterinary Research Institute in the
city of Pokrov. The result was positive for AFS. The official
confirmation came from the Stavropol laboratory on the afternoon of
23 Mar 2010.

[The ASF panzootic started, initially, in Georgia. According to
available reports, including those provided by 2 international
missions to the region (see ProMED-mail postings 20070627.2066 and
20070920.3131), it started at the latest in April 2007 around the
harbour city of Poti, probably introduced (from West Africa?) via
importation, by ship, of contaminated pork or pork waste.
Contaminated pig swill -- remainders of food, including a pork scrap
that is then fed to swine -- has also been implicated as a conduit
for outbreaks in swine populations in the past.

Since then, the disease has spread further, mainly within the wild
boar population while affecting domestic pig farms, in the Caucasus,
including Armenia, Nagorno-Karabagh, and Azerbaijan, followed by a
north-western spread in Russia. According to Russia's reports to the
OIE, ASF has, so far, been reported from the following territories:
Chechen Republic, Ingushetia Republic, Kabardino-Balkaria Republic,
Krasnodar Kray, Orenburg Oblast, the Svernaya Osetiya Republic,
Rostov Oblast, and Stavropol Kray.

A map of the Caucasus showing several of the affected territories is
available at

A single outbreak occurred in Northern Russia, in Leningrad Oblast,
in September 2009. The route of this long-distance introduction has
not been elucidated. The outbreak was eradicated by stamping out (see
ProMED-mail 20091027.3720). Investigations in the wild boar
population in the area did not detect infection, and the case was
declared as resolved in January 2010. The situation is clearly
different in the Caucasus and the affected south Russian territories,
where the disease, most probably, has become endemic within the wild
boar population, threatening further spread to Ukraine and elsewhere.

Although Muslim populations do not consume pork, Iran, Turkey, and
central Asia, as rightly commented by the FAO (see ProMED-mail
20091027.3720), could form a transit point for the virus because of
relatively large numbers of wild boar in these areas. Since no
pig-industry is practised in such countries, ASF could remain
unnoticed, since it will affect wild boars only. Turkey, which is
known to include a large wild-boar population, borders 2 infected
countries, Georgia and Armenia. According to an FAO update, during
2009 the organisation's Emergency Prevention System in animal health
matters provided regional training courses for veterinary authorities
in Ukraine and Belarus. Has sero-surveillance been contemplated in
the wild boar population of Eastern Turkey?

According to current information, ASF is not zoonotic. - Mod.AS]
