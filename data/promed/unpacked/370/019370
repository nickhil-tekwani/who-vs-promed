CARACAS, Venezuela -- Health Ministry officials said an outbreak of dengue
fever has killed at least eight people this year and sickened thousands
more in Venezuela.
Officials also said although outbreaks of dengue are common in Venezuela
and Latin America, recent heavy rains have multiplied the mosquito
population, which transmits the disease. Officials are urging people with
any influenza-type symptoms to seek immediate treatment. About 15,000
people have fallen ill this year from both the classic form of dengue and
hemorrhagic dengue [DHF. The latter is a particularly devastating form of
the disease characterized by severe muscle pain, skin lesions, internal
bleeding and sometimes death. The symptoms of classic dengue are less severe.

[Dengue was reported to be decreasing in Venezuela in December last year.
It appears to be taking off again now. Can anyone give us figures for the
number of DHF cases & deaths? - Mod.JW
