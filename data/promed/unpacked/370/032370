Seven more cases of diphtheria have been discovered among asylum seekers in Britain in a week after it was revealed a migrant who died after contracting disease had previously been discharged from hospital. New figures on diphtheria revealed today [6 Dec 2022] by the UK Health Security Agency showed total number of cases among channel arrivals this year [2022] is now at 57. Of those, 52 have been discovered since the beginning of October [2022], the UKHSA said.

It comes after there were reports of fresh cases of diphtheria being found at the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent.

The UKHSA said 7 cases of diphtheria among asylum seekers were reported between 28 Nov and 4 Dec [2022]. In the previous week -- from 21 to 27 Nov [2022] -- the total was 50 after 5 cases were reported.

According to the latest report, some 44 of the cases have been recorded in the South East, as well as fewer than 5 in each of the following areas: London, West Midlands, South West, North East, and the North West. No breakdown by county has been provided.

Last week the immigration minister told MPs [Members of Parliament] that asylum seekers with symptoms of diphtheria would be put into isolation after the UKHSA said there had been an 'increase' in the number of infections among those coming to the UK.

Robert Jenrick [Minister of State for Immigration] said migrants showing signs of the highly contagious disease will be separated for a 'short period' at Manston or held in a 'designated isolation centre' while they are treated. Any asylum seekers who may have the infection but are already in hotels would be told to isolate in their rooms while they are treated.

Yesterday it was revealed that a channel migrant who died of diphtheria had earlier been taken to hospital and discharged. This migrant, 31, died on 19 Nov [2022], one week after reaching Britain, an inquest heard.

[ProMED has recently posted several reports on diphtheria at facilities in Europe used to house recent asylum seekers (see ProMED posts Diphtheria - Germany: toxigenic Corynebacterium diphtheriae, cutaneous, migrants 20221119.8706803, Diphtheria - UK (02): (England) asylum seekers 20221127.8706944, Diphtheria - UK: (England) asylum seekers 20221021.8706299, and Diphtheria - Switzerland: (Bern) asylum seekers 20220804.8704867).

In Germany, there were 42 cases of diphtheria caused by toxigenic _Corynebacterium diphtheriae_ in migrants who had arrived in Germany since May 2022. There were no cases in migrants in 2019, 7 in 2020, and 7 in 2021. Most cases in migrants were detected by medical examinations at reception centers. Countries of origin, when known, were mostly Syria (n = 21) and Afghanistan (n = 17), with one each from Tunisia and Yemen. Migrants were en route often for months, living under very poor hygienic condition, usually without access to healthcare services. For 23 of the 42 cases with information on transit routes to Germany, most traveled along a Balkan route -- that is, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, and Slovenia -- where they were said to have likely acquired diphtheria, based in part on genetic analysis of isolates.

We don't have similar detailed data from the recent ProMED reports of diphtheria in migrants in the UK or Switzerland. The news report above says that there are now a total of 57 cases of diphtheria in cases among Channel arrivals so far this year [2022], including one recent death. Of those 57, 52 were discovered since the beginning of October 2022. "Some" were said to be symptomatic before arrival in the UK (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63771091), but we were not told how many could have been infected before arrival vs how many were likely infected at the former Manston airfield facility being used as a reception center for the asylum seekers.

For a discussion of diphtheria in the WHO European Region, please see ProMED post Diphtheria - WHO European Region, 2010-19 20220226.870167.

The former military Manston airfield, which was previously Defence Fire Training and Development Centre, in Thanet, Kent, UK, was originally meant to temporarily hold (24-48 hours) 1000 cross-Channel migrants, but subsequently was being used to house 3000 people for prolonged stays (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-63164644). Children were reported to be sleeping on floors (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-63262176), although children are not supposed to be accommodated at the site.

The Isle of Thanet is a peninsula forming the easternmost part of Kent, England (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Thanet). A map showing the location of Thanet can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Thanet+District,+UK. - Mod.ML
