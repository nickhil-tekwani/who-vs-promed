There seems to be a problem. The answer to emerging diseases is to have
resources that will enable characterization and detection of new or
resurgent disease and for appropriate research to be conducted. If any
third, second, or first world country thinks that construction of putative
facilities is the politically correct solution to emerging disease (is that
the problem?) without the hard work of maintaining standards, ensuring day
to day control from hand washing on up, the laboratories are a greater risk
than the disease.
I was there when we had no P3 or P2 facilities for HIV
and guys spent many a night wondering if that little sore throat they had
was IT. Anyone who works with infectious agents has to absolutely believe
in the containment system they have at their bench and that it really
works. You have to REALLY believe.
Any bureaucratic recommendation has to
be examined in the light of the risk of not only your but your family and
community becoming infected. If the P(X) race you seem to advocate
materializes, facilities will be built by the lowest bidder so that
bureaucrats will be able to announce that they have a P(X) facility. For
me, CDC containment regulations are minimum. Without ironclad control and
vigilance they are a negative factor.

[Cecil has a point. But ProMED-mail is NOT advocating a P4 lab-building
race -- we are merely responding to a readerÂ´s question, & it turns out that
there are more such labs in existence & under construction than many of us
realised -- I omitted to list the planned new P4 lab at Botucatu, Brazil.
This is in response to the plain fact that existing facilities are
hopelessly backlogged with specimens from, for example, collections of
insects & wildlife from Ebola foci, and the increasing importations of
exotic hemorrhagic fever cases - Mod.JW
