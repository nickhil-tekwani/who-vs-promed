Re: Anthrax island - UK: (Scotland) Gruinard Island, possible purchase 20180402.5724024. Well, we got snookered! A number of subscribers have contacted us -- all much appreciated as subscriber response is key to ProMED -- on this annual [April Fools' Day] joke by the Scottish Sunday Herald.

Michael Hudson <hudsonmj@gmail.com> (anthrax researcher, Public Health England, Porton) commented: "I think the expert from the 'Centre for Expert Studies' named Philby Burgess-Maclean is a real giveaway. It is all nicely done though." Rob Broughton <rhboughton@gmail.com> also noted this.

John Robins (via Merritt Clifton), chief executive of Animal Concern Scotland and the Scottish Anti-Vivisection Society, commented on the Russian bidders Kulagin, Glebov, and Baratynsky. KGB! Indicative but reinforces doubt.

David Stevenson MD [Honorary Fellow, Population Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Scotland <David.Stevenson@ed.ac.uk>] on the habit of Scottish newspapers to celebrate 1 April. He has written to the editor of the Sunday Herald commenting on Sunday's report.

So I think we can safely assume that these Russian experts in the removals business, in chemicals, and in social media companies will not be investing their fortunes in Gruinard Island. And I look forward to [1 Apr 2019] and what the Sunday Herald will report on then. Hopefully I will catch it.
