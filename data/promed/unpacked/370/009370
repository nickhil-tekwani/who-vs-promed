A 3rd case of case of Schmallenberg virus (SBV) has been confirmed in Aberdeenshire, with more cases expected in the area in the near future.

The latest case involved a homebred heifer calf on a farm north of Aberdeen which was found to have deformities typical of SBV and tested positive for the virus.

PCR testing was carried out by Moredun Research Institute following a post-mortem examination of the calf undertaken by SAC Consulting, Veterinary Services.

SAC Veterinary Services Manager Brian Hosie said: "Although we cannot predict what will happen, given that there have now been 3 cases of SBV in Aberdeenshire, it is likely that further cases will be identified in the area in the near future.

Initial investigations suggest the virus was possibly introduced to Aberdeenshire with store cattle brought in from infected areas last autumn [2012]. Midges could have spread the virus from the store cattle to the homebred stock over the late autumn/early winter [2012-2013], according to SAC.

The cases in Aberdeenshire, in northern Scotland, highlight how the disease has spread across virtually all of mainland Britain. Figures published by the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency (AHVLA) in April 2013 showed how the 1750 cases recorded in Britain had been spread across every county in England and Wales and much of Scotland. But at the time, AHVLA reported that all cases outside of Dumfries and Galloway in 9 other counties related to animals introduced into Scotland from areas where SBV had been reported.

SRUC advises any farmers who encounter foetal abnormalities, stillbirths, or newborns showing signs of nervous disease [to] contact their vet or local SAC Consulting: Veterinary Services Disease Surveillance Centre (DSC). They should not assume these are SBV cases, as other diseases can cause birth defects in lambs and calves, and it is important to know which disease you are dealing with.

Schmallenberg virus in Italy: a retrospective survey in Culicoides stored during the bluetongue Italian surveillance program. Authors: M. Goffredo, F. Monaco, G. Capelli, M. Quaglia, V. Federici, M. Catalani, F. Montarsi, A. Polci, C. Pinoni, P. Calistri, G. Savini

Abstract:
Following the 1st case of Schmallenberg (SBV) in northern Italy in February 2012, virus detection was conducted on midges collected during the national entomological surveillance program for bluetongue (BT). Six cattle farms, within a radius of 50 km from the SBV case, were selected for a 12-month study, aiming to determine when the virus entered the area, if it was capable of overwintering, and the possible role played by each species of the _Obsoletus complex_ in disseminating the infection.

A total of 33 724 culicoides were collected at the 6 sites between June 2011 and June 2012. Species belonging to the _Obsoletus complex_ were the most abundant (94.44 percent), and, within the complex, _Culicoides obsoletus_ was the most prevalent species in the studying area (65.4 percent).

Nearly 7000 culicoides midges were screened, either in pools or individually, for SBV by real-time RT-PCR. Viral genome was detected in 6 pools of the _Obsoletus complex_, collected at 3 sites between September and November 2011, and in a single parous female of _C. obsoletus_, collected in May 2012.

As a result of the BT surveillance program in Italy, it was possible to demonstrate, retrospectively, that SBV has circulated in at least 3 Italian provinces since early September 2011, nearly 5 months prior and as far as 40 km away from the 1st detected case.

Similarly, the survey confirmed the presence of SBV in the vector population 3 months after the outbreak, following a cold winter during which the blacklight traps failed to catch active adult midges.

Schmallenberg virus among female lambs, Belgium, 2012. Authors: Claine F, Coupeau D, Wiggers L, Muylkens B, Kirschvink N.

1. Abstract
Reemergence of SBV occurred among lambs (n=50) in a sheep flock in Belgium between mid-July and mid-October 2012. Bimonthly assessment by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and seroneutralization demonstrated that 100 percent of the lambs were infected. Viremia duration may be longer in naturally infected than in experimentally infected animals.

2. Concluding part
The data collected during this study demonstrate that even in regions with a high SBV seroprevalence, viral circulation and primary infection of naive animals occur. In addition to the question of duration of colostral protection, this observation raises questions about virus hosts. It might be hypothesized that other species are reservoirs. In autumn 2011, a seroprevalence of 43 percent was found in deer in the province of Namur, suggesting that deer might have been a reservoir during 2011-2012. Serum samples of 3 roe deer hunted in autumn 2012 in the forest near the sheep flock observed in this study tested positive by SN assay, indicating a higher percentage of seroconversion among samples from deer in 2012. It might further be speculated that notable vector activity favored viral circulation. During the summer 2007 serotype 8 bluetongue virus outbreak, vector activity was assessed among the study flock of sheep and revealed substantial numbers of newly emerged female culicoides spp. midges. This peak activity of vectors paralleled the episode of clinical serotype 8 bluetongue virus manifestation. Hypothesizing that the local culicoides spp. midge population did not substantially change over the years, the intense infection rate during August-September 2012 could be related to increased seasonal vector activity.

Although reemergence of SBV among cattle is of concern, reemergence of SBV among sheep and goats is of particular importance, because high prolificacy and intensive reproduction of sheep and goats continuously lead to a noteworthy percentage of susceptible animals among the population. Moreover, the early onset of puberty in these species increases the probability of SBV infection at an early stage of gestation, leading to potential virus overwintering by transplacental infection of offspring, which could potentially lead to economic loss related to death or culling of offspring. Detailed knowledge about duration of viremia after natural SBV infection and duration of colostral protection are necessary for elaboration of efficient breeding and vaccination strategies.

[Infections with SBV have so far been reportedly identified in the following European countries: Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, UK and Northern Ireland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Denmark, Estonia, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Austria, Switzerland and Serbia. According to indirect reports, Hungary and Slovenia were affected as well, but official confirmation has, so far, not come to our attention. As long as SBV remains a non-notifiable disease, its actual distribution will remain unclear.

The SBV situation in Europe was included in the itinerary of the recent annual session of the OIE. Results of those discussions will be posted when they become available. - Mod.AS
