Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) - update -1 Apr 2014
---------------------------
On [30 Mar 2014], the National IHR Focal Point of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) notified WHO of an additional laboratory-confirmed case of infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).

Details of the case provided to WHO are as follows:
A 64 year-old man from Abu Dhabi with underlying medical conditions. He became ill on [21 Mar 2014], and was admitted to hospital on [25 Mar 2014]. His condition deteriorated and he was placed in intensive care. He passed away on [30 Mar 2014]. The patient had no reported contact with laboratory-confirmed cases, however did report having contact with animals, including camels. The patient also had a recent history of travel to Oman and to Saudi Arabia. Further epidemiological investigation in ongoing.

Globally, from September 2012 to date, WHO has been informed of a total of 207 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV, including 87 deaths.

WHO advice

Based on the current situation and available information, WHO encourages all Member States to continue their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns.

Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in health care facilities. Health-care facilities that provide for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS-CoV infection should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health-care workers and visitors. Health care workers should be educated, trained and refreshed with skills on infection prevention and control.

It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS-CoV early because some have mild or unusual symptoms. For this reason, it is important that health-care workers apply standard precautions consistently with all patients - regardless of their diagnosis - in all work practices all the time.

[This newly reported case represents the 17th laboratory confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection with possible exposure in the UAE. As mentioned above, the global tally of laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection maintained by WHO is now 207 including 87 deaths. This tally does not include the 26 year old male reported on the Saudi MOH website on 28 Mar 2014 (see MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (21): Saudi Arabia 20140328.2364957) which would bring the global tally to 208 cases including 87 deaths.

One can't help but "muse" about possible routes of transmission of the MERS-CoV. More and more evidence is pointing to camels as a possible/probable source of infection, as more and more studies are identifying a high level of seropositivity of camels, and in some cases, identifying parts of the virus genetic material in camels. But not all of the sporadic cases gave a history of exposure to camels (or other animals) during the presumed incubation period. That being said, there have been several nosocomial outbreaks described to explain some of the transmission. And the identification of asymptomatic infections in contacts of laboratory confirmed cases suggests there may be some relatively "silent" person to person transmission occurring resulting in an occasional serious or fatal illness in an individual with pre-existing co-morbidites.

Of interest, in a conversation with a colleague based in the Middle East today, this moderator learned that a dish that has been popular in the region, kibbe - a specialty made of meat. The wikipedia page on this says "Kibbeh or kibbe (also kubbeh, kebbah or kubbi) is an Levantine dish made of bulghur (cracked wheat), minced onions and finely ground lean beef, lamb, goat or camel meat. The best-known variety is a torpedo-shaped fried croquette stuffed with minced beef or lamb. Other types of kibbeh may be shaped into balls or patties, and baked or cooked in broth" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbeh). While the traditional kibbes discussed above mention they are fried (or baked), this moderator learned that they are also eaten raw. In 2013 there was a multistate outbreak of salmonellosis associated with eating raw kibbehs in the USA (see prior ProMED-mail post Salmonellosis, serotype Typhimurium - USA: ground beef 20130126.1515904 for details of the outbreak).Another outbreak associated with ingestion of raw camel meat and organs included an outbreak of plague _yersinia pestis_ associated with ingestion of raw camel's liver in Saudi Arabia in 1994 (see http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3310619/ for the full article of Bin Saeed AA, Al-Hamdan NA, Fontaine RE. Plague from eating raw camel liver. Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet]. 2005 Sep). In this case, _Y. pestis_ was identified in the bone marrow of the camel. One can't help but wonder if the practice of preparing and/or eating raw camel meat and organs might be yet another potential route of transmission of this virus for some of the sporadic cases without a known history of direct contact with live animals or persons with known laboratory confirmed infection.
