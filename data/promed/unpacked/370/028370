According to an official report of the Ministry of Health of Peru
(MOH), an outbreak of hemorrhagic fever syndrome in Alto Tuntus had
its 1st victim on 2 Dec 2005. From 23 Dec 2005 through 28 Dec 2005, 6
more people died. The rate attack is 17.1 percent (73 people); the
CFR is 10 percent (7 dead).

The main symptoms are fever, headache, general malaise, bilious
vomiting and hemorrhagic vomiting. Some patients had bleeding of oral
mucosa. Dr. Maguia, an infectious disease specialist from Cayetano
Heredia University, suspects an outbreak of Jungle Yellow Fever.
Other possible causes are hepatitis D, over Hepatitis B (which is
endemic in that area); Leptospirosis; and Arenavirus Hemorrhagic
Fever.

Alto Tuntus is a very small village located very far away in the
department of Amazonas, northeast of Lima. It has 435 inhabitants,
all of them from the Aguaruna ethnic group. To reach Alto Tuntus by
land, one needs 7 days of walking and by air, one hour and a half by
helicopter, departing from Bagua, the capitol city of Amazonas. 2 of
5 patients evacuated to the hospital of Bagua have proteinuria and
oligoanuria, symptoms compatible with Yellow Fever. Samples have been
taken and sent to the laboratory of the National Institute of Health
in Lima.

The existence of this outbreak was 1st reported in a radio call to a
national radio network on 26 Dec 2005. A health team reached the
village on the morning of 28 Dec 2005. The health team remains in the
area providing care to the people of Alto Tuntus.

2005] that the disease affecting the population of the community of
Alto Tuntus (Amazonas), is yellow fever, according to testing done by
the laboratories of the National Institute of Health.

As soon as the confirmation was made, a team of 24 professionals
(physicians, epidemiologists, nurses and health technicians) were
flown in by helicopter carrying 2000 doses of yellow fever vaccine to
the area to conduct a vaccination campaign in an epidemiologic circle
around the community of Alto Tuntus.

The approximate population in the affected area is 500 inhabitants.

[The above report [2] confirms the diagnosis of yellow fever despite
earlier statements in the news media that this had been ruled out.
ProMED-mail is appreciative of the further information supplied to
date. The differential diagnosis given in part [1] is in keeping with
that mentioned in the original posting on this outbreak. The
additional clinical information of associated bilious vomiting
further points to those etiologies with known hepatic involvement,
but still on the original differential diagnosis listing. We await
further information as it becomes available. - Mod.MPP]
