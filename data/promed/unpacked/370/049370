[African swine fever (ASF) is a serious viral disease of pigs, endemic in Africa. The virus is currently the sole member of the new genus Asfivirus in the family _Asfarviridae_. ASFV is the only DNA virus transmitted by arthropods.

ASFV isolates can vary greatly in their virulence, from highly virulent isolates that kill most pigs (such as the current case in Cote d'Ivoire) to viruses that result only in seroconversion.

There is no vaccine or treatment. ASF is not a zoonotic disease and does not affect public health.
