BSE IN BELGIUM: THIRD CASE
Belgium's third BSE case was confirmed by government officials yesterday, 30
March, on a 5 year-old dairy cow from a farm in Waarschoot (province of East
Flanders). The cow was referred to the veterinary faculty in Ghent
(Belgium), where clinicians suspected BSE and informed the government
veterinary inspectors on 6 March. The referring veterinarian had initially
suspected a metabolic disorder, especially since the animal (which had
showed hypersensitivity and changed behaviour) seemed to improve on mineral
and vitamin treatment, but then relapsed. The cow was euthanized and
incinerated at the Denderleeuw rendering plant on March 9, the brain was
sent for analysis to the CERVA (national veterinary research centre), who
confirmed the disease on Monday.
The 124-head dairy herd of the farm in Waarschoot were culled and
incinerated, while the brains of all adult cattle (over two years of age)
were sent to the CERVA for analysis. The animal was born on 22 August 1992,
i.e. two years before the ban on bone and animal meal in ruminant feed
became effective in Belgium. The cow originally came from another farm in
Waarschoot, from where she was sold to her current owner in March 1996. Both
farms have been placed under surveillance and all cattle which came from
either farm and is still alive will be traced, slaughtered and incinerated
while their brain tissue will be submitted for analysis.
Analysis from the animals culled following the second Belgian BSE case
(March 10 ) are still underway.

[While one understands the bureaucratic desire to get rid of a problem as
quickly as possible, in this case by whole herd slaughter, one must wonder
as to what the results of risk-analysis have been for the alternative
scenario of immediate slaughter of only the clinical cases. - Mod.MHJ
