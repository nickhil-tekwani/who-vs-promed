Mild avian flu in KZN
---------------
Johannesburg - A mild form of avian influenza has been diagnosed in poultry
in the Camperdown area of KwaZulu-Natal, the SA Poultry Association said.
The association said in a statement released in Johannesburg the influenza
was only a mild respiratory disease [that] caused a temporary drop in egg
production, but poses no threat to humans.
The sub-type of the avian influenza has been identified and confirmed by
the Avian Virology Laboratory in the United Kingdom as the H6N2 strain.
"This particular sub-type is not associated with serious disease in poultry
and has not been associated with disease in humans," the statement read.
South Africa's internationally recognized status as free from the highly
virulent form of avian influenza was therefore not affected.
The origin of the outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal has not yet been established
but was under investigation. The provincial and national Departments of
Agriculture would be involved in the attempt to restrict and control the
outbreak.
The association urged poultry producers who suspected that avian influenza
might be present in their flocks to report it to their nearest state
veterinarian.

Avian Influenza Threatens Kwazulu-Natal Poultry Farms
-------------------
Intensive sero-surveillance of farms and poultry enterprises in the
Camperdown district of KwaZulu-Natal is underway following the discovery of
Avian influenza in the first outbreak of the disease in southern Africa.
The discovery of the virus coincides with reports of recent outbreaks in
many parts of the world where it has not occurred before.
While veterinary scientists maintain the disease poses no risk to people or
poultry products, various strains of it can have a crippling effect on the
poultry business. In previous recorded cases in the US, UK, and the Far
East entire chicken farms and enterprises have been closed down by the disease.
However, according to provincial veterinarian Roger Horner, who diagnosed
the virus in tissue from infected chickens just more than 2 weeks ago, the
virus affecting chickens in the Camperdown area has been diagnosed as a low
pathogenic variety, and it does not give rise to alarming mortality rates.
However, Horner warned with 2 local enterprises already suffering a 40
percent reduction in egg production, the disease could have serious
economic implications for the local poultry business if it was not contained.
Originally called in by local farmers to investigate "something going
through the flocks" in the middle of last month, Horner began conducting
post-mortems on several chickens. After routine checks for common chicken
ailments, Horner began virus isolation on tissue of birds received from 2
poultry enterprises in the area only to discover the presence of the disease.
While subsequent tests, locally and internationally, have revealed this
particular strain of virus is not as deadly as that which destroyed poultry
businesses in the UK, US, and Far East, SA authorities have yet to learn
how it will affect different chickens, in particular commercial layers,
broilers, and breeders.
The authorities also do not know the extent of the outbreak in the
Camperdown district and other parts of the country.
The national agriculture department has agreed to finance the necessary
testing kits for Avian influenza. The department is conducting surveillance
through blood testing on chickens on farms and villages all over Camperdown
district. It is being aided in this by farmers and the
KwaZulu-Natal Poultry Institute. Random blood testing in other provinces
will be undertaken to see if there are any outbreaks beyond KwaZulu-Natal.
Camperdown farmers were advised to practice strict bio-security measures
and discourage unannounced visitors.
