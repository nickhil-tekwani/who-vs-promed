As a participating researcher and wildlife veterinarian involved in many of
the earlier cases of flaccid trunk paralysis (known as Floppy Trunk
Syndrome or FTS) in Zimbabwe I would like to make some corrections to the
posted article and note some points regarding this syndrome.
An important epidemiological factor to note is that this syndrome is not
actually spreading across southern Africa as stated in the article posted.
Confirmed cases have been recorded in a particular area (Fothergill Island)
in the Matusadona National Park only. A similar syndrome has been seen in 8
animals in the Kruger National Park in South Africa but there is no
evidence to indicate a common source or a spread to other areas.
Concerning the cases in Matusadona National Park - to date there have been
17 trunk biopsies performed, 5 post-mortem examinations and a total of 35 -
40 identified cases of FTS (as opposed to the several hundred to 2,000
cases reported in the previous article). Of these cases, 2-3 animals have
been reported to have completely recovered.
The biopsy results have revealed varying degrees of acute, sub-acute and
chronic muscle degeneration associated with nerve damage in the trunk.
Etiology is still uncertain. In addition to monitoring of affected
individuals, plant, soil and water surveys have been carried out. Water has
been examined for 8 chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides and their component
compounds. These were found to be at concentrations of less than 10 ppb and
were considered insignificant. In addition water was analyzed for lead,
copper and cobalt - all of which were also found to occur at levels low
enough to be insignificant. A water study of the area conducted by the
British Geological Survey in 1994 found that major elements (calcium,
sodium, magnesium and potassium) and 23 trace elements associated with
pollution (cobalt, nickel, lead, zinc, cadmium, etc.) existed at very low
levels. Soils was also tested and toxic compounds were found to be low or
at undetectable levels. Although selenium levels in many of the plant
species in the area appeared to be low, insufficient knowledge exists about
requirements for wild animals and no conclusions can be drawn. Current
thinking indicates that the most likely etiology is of plant origin and
studies are being performed on an abundant weed (_Boerhavia erecta_) being
actively selected by elephants at Fothergill Island.
This information has been published in the Proceedings of the Seminar on
Elephant Floppy Trunk Syndrome held at Fothergill Island on March 8, 1998.

[It is really good to have this hard information. As far as real number of
cases FTS, good numbers for true incidence and geographic distribution in
the elephant population are most likely hard to come by because of the
present lack of adequate performance in monitoring and surveillance
activities. Just another example of why the companion AHEAD field project
would be so beneficial. - Mod.PC
