3. Update: Ciguatera Outbreak at a Restaurant with Two Species of Fish
Over a Two-Day Interval
Bill l. Toth, MPH, Orange County Health Department
Roberta M. Hammond, Ph.D., Bureau of Environmental Epidemiology
Background
------------------
The Orange County Health Department received a report from Florida Hospital
South on Sat 20 Nov 1999 regarding three (3) patients they had
seen in their emergency department with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
bradycardia, depressed blood pressures, tingling and numbness around the
mouth, and numbing and tingling in the hands and feet. One individual
described a hot and cold sensation reversal. A 4th man was hospitalized
at Winter Park Hospital with a similar condition.
These individuals included people from three parties and one employee of the
restaurant. All had eaten mahi mahi or amberjack fish on Fri 19 Nov 1999.
Their onset of illness was from 3-12 hours after ingesting fish at the
restaurant. The time of onset, symptoms and duration were compatible with
ciguatoxin
exposure.
The Orange County Epidemiologist made a site visit to the restaurant on Mon
22 Nov 1999, concurrent with the Department of Business and Professional
Regulation (DBPR). A regulatory inspection was conducted by DBPR, which
revealed no major infractions). The FDA was notified so a traceback could be
initiated.
Update
----------
A total of 15 individuals who were symptomatic were contacted. The symptoms
were nausea (100%), vomiting (80%), diarrhea (93%), perioral numbness and
tingling (93%), an tingling sensation in their hands (100%), arms (80%),
feet (100%), and legs (20%). Forty percent complained of headache, hot/cold
sensation reversal (93%), dizziness (67%), itching (53%), and exhaustion
(100%). Of those who were screened, 40% had bradycardia (mean 35.3 bpm) and
hypotension (20%) was also noted. One individual complained of photophobia.
The mean onset period for those ill was 5.13 hours (range 2-12 hours).
Several individuals complained of lingering, but improving signs and
symptoms for over one week. Those party members who ate at the restaurant
at the same time as those ill and did not consume amberjack or mahi mahi
were not ill.
Eleven of those who were ill consumed amberjack at the restaurant. Four
separate individuals who were ill consumed mahi mahi at a different serving
time at the same restaurant. Serving times are aggregated into lunch and
dinner service on two dates (18 & 19 Nov 1999). The signs and symptoms of
the infected patients are consistent with their exposure to ciguatoxin
through their meals of amberjack or mahi mahi. Duration of illness,
although less severe, is also consistent with the toxin.

Amberjack and mahi mahi were supplied to the restaurant on a daily basis
from separate local distributors. Mahi mahi has been rarely documented in
ciguatera intoxication with the jack family of fishes being more commonly
implicated. Since the chances of two species of fish causing the same
illness in a single restaurant over two-day interval appeared remote, a
question of cross contamination of toxin from amberjack to mahi mahi was
raised. The distribution of fish exposure linked to illness would, likely,
be relatively random over the two day interval, i.e., the exposure to mahi
mahi would be expected to be mixed well with amberjack exposure. The array
of exposure outlined in the table above clearly shows a separation of
exposures to the two species.
Researchers at FDA in Dauphin Island and at the Dade County Ciguatera
Network agree that the spread of ciguatoxin through cross contamination of
fish is highly unlikely. Samples of both types of fish have been sent by
FDA to their laboratory in Seattle for testing for histamines and ciguatoxin
as well as for speciation. No results are available at this time.
