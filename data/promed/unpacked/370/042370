[Kelly Morris, an editor of The Lancet, has kindly and generously notified
ProMED-mail of an article in tomorrow's (28 February) edition that will be
of interest to ProMED-mail readers. The web site address for this article
in The Lancet is
<http://www.thelancet.com/lancet/User/vol351no9103/news/index.html#usanthrax
>. This article has a hot key link to the ProMED-mail web site section in
which the original article appeared. - Mod.CHC
A plea from the Pentagon has prevented an "eleventh-hour" closure of the
only US producer of anthrax vaccine. The state-owned Michigan Biologic
Products Institute will continue to make vaccine for the mass immunisation
of US military personnel, until [the Insitute is sold or until the end of
the fiscal year on Sept 30.
Inoculation of all [armed forces members, ordered by the Defense
Department in December, 1997, is planned to start this year. But concerns
have been expressed over the vaccine's ability to prevent anthrax after
inhalation of large doses--the likely biological-warfare scenario.
According to a ProMED-mail posting, the vaccine was licensed by the US Food
and Drug Administration in 1970 on the basis of one published study, with
five inhalation cases only. Animal studies have shown survival rates of
4-100% after vaccination and anthrax challenge. The posting quotes a 1994
Staff Report for the Committee on Veterans' Affairs as noting "its [the
vaccine's safety, particularly when given to thousands of soldiers in
conjunction with other vaccines, is not well established".
Researchers in Obolensk, Russia, have been genetically engineering strains
to act as live anthrax vaccines. In December, the team described expression
of _Bacillus cereus_ toxins in an anthrax strain (Vaccine 1997; 15:
1846-50). Some experts note that current toxin-based vaccines might not
protect against this strain.

[If the Institute will be sold, one can safely assume it will also be
bought, so it seems likely that production of such vaccines will continue,
under one aegis or another.
BTW, this same issue contains an article "Japan taken to court over germ
warfare allegations" that might also be of interest to some of our readers.
