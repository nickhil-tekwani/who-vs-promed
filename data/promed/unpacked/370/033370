A new outbreak of FMD was confirmed in Britain and 6 more were expected to
be confirmed later in the day, it was announced. The confirmed site was in
Cumbria, northwest England.
Chief Veterinary Officer Jim Scudamore said the other 6 outbreaks expected
to be confirmed later were in Northern Ireland, 2 in Scotland, and 3 more
in England.
Northern Ireland's agriculture ministry said it believed the disease had
crossed the Irish Sea to the province. If all the sites are confirmed it
will bring the number of outbreaks in Britain to 33.

Here are the theories of how the epidemic started - and their likelihood:
Infected meat from abroad
------------------------------
Infected imported meat is the only theory of how FMD got here to which vets
are giving any credence. They say this is because the primary source of the
outbreak is so specific. The virus could have entered the country on cured
or dried meat - cooking meat kills the virus - or on a carcass.
Areas of the world where the disease is endemic, where infected meat could
have come from, include parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and South
America. The virulent "type O" strain found in Britain is similar to, but
not exactly the same as, the type found in South Africa last year. First
identified in India in 1990, it has penetrated countries which have not
suffered an outbreak for decades. In South Africa, the disease was traced
to food waste offloaded illegally from an Asian boat in Durban harbor and
fed as pig swill. In Japan, which had not recorded an outbreak of the
disease since 1908, the suspect was hay and silage from China contaminated
with feces, urine or saliva. In South Korea, dust storms from China were
suspected.
Ministry investigators will want to go back beyond the catering waste which
was fed as pig swill at Bobby Waugh's Burnside Farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall,
Northumberland - the primary source of the FMD outbreak - to the
ingredients of the food that went into it. It is wholly probable that the
trail will go cold, because of the difficulty of tracing every ingredient
in the food as long ago as early February [2001.
People have suggested the swill could have come from airline meals from
Newcastle airport. Mr. Waugh said they came from school meals. Keith Baker,
a past president of the British Veterinary Association and a former
Government assistant chief veterinary officer, said: "International food
waste from planes is not allowed to be fed as swill. We need to be sure of
the facts before we say what happened."
Airborne "viral plume" from the Continent
-----------------------------------------
Highly unlikely. There have been no known outbreaks on the Continent for
years. The most likely primary source of the outbreak in Britain is still
Mr. Waugh's farm. It is too far across the North Sea for it to have come by
air, though the most recent British outbreak, on the Isle of Wight in 1981,
was carried 170 miles from Brittany. Mr. Baker said: "That was a once in a
lifetime thing. If there was any transfer this time it is more likely to
have been the other way." [In fact it had happened a number of times in
previous years. Check the literature. - Mod.MHJ
Germ warfare by someone trying to stop the keeping of farm animals or the
Countryside Alliance's Liberty and Livelihood March
----------------------------------------
The television "Fat Lady" and field sports enthusiast, Clarissa Dickson
Wright, is one of those -- some senior backbench MPs among them -- who have
espoused this theory. She said: "There are people out there who would stop
at nothing to disrupt country life." The story goes that animal welfare
activists were seen in the vicinity of Mr. Waugh's farm just before Christmas.
Mr. Baker described this theory as crackpot. "Any organization trying to do
something like this has first to get the virus, import it and then to get
it into a farm," he said. He adds the earliest lesions on the pigs at
Burnside Farm date from 10 Feb 2001, far too late for the disease to have
been contracted before Christmas. The likelihood is the evidence will all
be circumstantial. We may never know for sure.

[With my own knowledge of this disease I would rank the priorities as given
in this report. The primary infection had to come from somewhere. A UK
source prior to the Northumberland pig farm is not impossible but has yet
to be found; on that basis the disease may already be in the Continent. An
airborne spread from the Continent would have hit the North Sea coast first
with outbreaks within, say, 10 km of the coast, not up a small valley
inland. An agriculture bioterrorism scenario is unlikely, as Northumberland
would be a poor target and fraught with problems of access. But the
possibility of idiots adding to the current spread for thrills or twisted
logic must be a major concern. - Mod.MHJ
