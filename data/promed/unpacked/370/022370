Army officials are trying to determine where and how a Fort Drum
soldier contracted rabies but believe he got the virus while stationed
out of the country, officials said this morning [24 Aug 2011].

"The soldier did not contract rabies in New York State, rather, he
likely contracted the disease during a recent overseas deployment,"
Fort Drum officials said in a prepared statement.

The soldier was diagnosed on Friday [19 Aug 2011] and is undergoing
treatment. People in close contact with the soldier are being notified
to assess whether they need post-exposure rabies vaccination,
officials said.

They declined to identify the soldier or disclose where he had been
stationed or was being treated, citing his rights under federal health
privacy laws.

The Army Medical Command is working with the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the U.S. Forces and Central commands, the
state Health Department and other agencies to determine where and how
the soldier was exposed to rabies, medical command spokesman Jaime
Cavazos said. Pinpointing the place can be difficult because soldiers
are transferred from one operating base to another, he said. "We've
got calls going everywhere," Cavazos said.

"The 10th Mountain Division is focused on taking care of this soldier
and his family," said Julie Cupernall, speaking for Fort Drum
officials. "Our thoughts and prayers are with them."

Rabies is caused by a virus that most often [almost always] is
transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal, according to the CDC
website. Left untreated, the virus attacks the central nervous system
and the brain, resulting in death. People can be successfully treated
using rabies vaccine and, if needed, human rabies immune globulin.

[Fort Drum is a U.S. Army military reservation in Jefferson County,
New York state. Its location is shown in the map at:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Drum. Fort Drum is home to the
10th Mountain Division.

This report is devoid of information regarding the place and
circumstances of the victim's exposure, presumably for security
reasons, which implies exposure outside of the United States. The
soldier is reported to be under treatment currently, but his condition
is not revealed. If the exposure was recent, vaccination and
administration of immune-globulin would be appropriate, but if the
soldier had been exhibiting symptoms of rabies virus infection prior
to treatment, it must be presumed that he is being treated according
to the Wisconsin protocol (see ProMED-mail references below), and his
eventual recovery is uncertain. Further information would be
appreciated as soon as security considerations permit. - Mod.CP]
