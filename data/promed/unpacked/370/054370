Avian influenza -- situation in Cambodia update
-----------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health (MoH) of the Kingdom of Cambodia reported 5 new human cases of avian influenza that were confirmed positive for the H5N1 virus in January 2013. Case details include an 8-month-old male from Phnom Penh with onset 9 Jan 2013, a 17-year-old female from Takeo Province with onset 11 Jan 2013, a 35-year-old male from Kong Pisey district, Kampong Speu Province, with onset 13 Jan 2013, a 17-month-old female from Kong Pisey district, Kampong Speu Province, with onset 13 Jan 2014, and a 9-year-old female from Toeuk Chhou district, Kampot Province, with onset on 15 Jan 2013.

The cases all presented with fever, cough and other ILI [influenza-like illness] symptoms. 4 of the cases died, with one case, the 8-month-old male, recovering after only experiencing mild ILI. Laboratory samples were tested by the National Institute of Public Health's laboratory and by the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge.

Preliminary evidence does not support human-to-human transmission and 4 of the cases are known to have had close contact with sick/dead poultry.

The Ministry of Health's Rapid Response Teams (RRT) have gone to the hospitals and the field to identify the patients' close contacts, any epidemiological linkage among the 5 cases and initiate preventive treatment as required. In addition, public health education campaigns are being conducted in the villages to inform families on how to protect themselves from contracting avian influenza. The teams are checking records for evidence of increased ILI activity in the local health centres or any increase in number of SARI [Severe Acute Respiratory Infection] cases from the affected areas.

Results from testing of those who have ILI symptoms among close contacts for A/H5N1 influenza to date were negative. There is enhanced surveillance for ILI and SARI in local health centre and hospital for a further 2 weeks. Health education messages have been distributed to the community. The World Health Organization is actively assisting the Ministry of Health in their investigations.

ProMED-mail Rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[Significant information in addition to that contained in 2 previous reports in ProMED [Avian influenza, human (01) and (02), referenced below] are the absence of enhanced SARI [Severe Acute Respiratory Infection] among the victims' contacts and in their local communities, and absence of avian influenza virus infection among patients with SARI in other communities. The results are consistent with enhanced susceptibility of individuals to avian influenza virus infection rather than increased exposure to infection, or greater virulence of the virus for the humans. - Mod.CP
