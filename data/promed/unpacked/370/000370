Kunjin virus is a relatively close genetic relative of MVEV [Murray
Valley encephalitis virus], but it is significantly more closely
related to West Nile virus. If I remember correctly, the ICTV
recognises it as a strain of West Nile virus.

[In the 8th ICTV Report Kunjin virus and West Nile virus are grouped
together (as members of the West Nile virus species), whereas Murray
Valley encephalitis virus is considered to be close to Alfuy virus
(together forming the Murray Valley encephalitis virus species). Both
species are members of the Japanese encephalitis virus group of
flaviviruses. - Mod.CP]

[ProMED-mail thanks Professor Gould for the clarification of the
relationship of Kunjin to West Nile virus. - Mod.TY]
