I am the Infection Control Nurse for a multi-facility health care

60 bed rehab center, 30 skilled nursing beds, ambulatory surgery center,
two dialysis centers, 2 home health agencies, an infusion network, day
care and a geriatric psych unit.
- 18% of our _S. aureus_ is MRSA;
- have seen sporadic cases of VRE in the past
two years;
- no MDR-TB yet (knock on wood);
- sporadic cases of PCN resistant _S. pnuemoniae_.
Please feel free to contact me PRN.
