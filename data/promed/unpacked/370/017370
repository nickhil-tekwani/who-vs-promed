[Ref: NA Yao Ruth et al: Growth characteristics of _Phytophthora
katsurae_ isolates from four coconut tree growing areas in Ivory
Coast. Eur J Sci Res 2010; 41, 162-71]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The coconut tree is threatened by _Phytophthora katsurae_, causal
agent of heart rot and premature nut fall. The disease causes the
rapid death of the tree and sometimes losses of more than 30 percent
of its production.

This study was motivated by differences in _P. katsurae_ disease
symptoms on coconut trees from one cultivation area to another.
Morphological observation and mycelium measurement of the pathogenic
agent was done to find out whether any species variability could
occur. [For this purpose,] 4 pathogen isolates were collected from
Marc Delorme research station (Port-Bouet), Robert Michaux production
station (Dabou), Fresco, and Assinie production stations and cultured
on 6 different media.

Results did not reveal any morphological differences between mycelia,
sporocysts oospores and chlamydospores. However, statistical analyses
of the mycelium measurements showed a highly significant difference
between the isolates. Similarly, a very highly significant
interaction between isolates and the culture media was observed.
Isolates from Marc Delorme and Robert Michaux were similar, while
isolates from Fresco and Assinie differed from each other and from
the 2 previous isolates.

The differences in mycelium growth could explain the epidemiological
difference observed in the areas from which these isolates were
collected. This difference could be due to the aggressiveness of each
isolate on the plant, or their genomic configuration. Genetic
variability including the variability in pathogenic aggressiveness
within the same species can be different.

[2] USA (Hawaii): spread

The declining health of the Hawaiian coconut trees has been
noticeable. The trees, particularly on the windward sides of Oahu,
Maui, Kauai, Molokai, and the Big Island, have been subject to the
spread of coconut heart rot (_Phytophthora katsurae_) which has been
threatening the "tree of life" since it was first detected on Kauai
in the 1970s. The University of Hawaii took interest in 2000 when 15
percent of the state's trees started to die from the coconut rot and
it was first noticed on the Big Island.

Over the past decade, a 98 percent success rate was achieved by a
local arborist to protect uninfected trees by injecting a phosphorus
based preparation yearly into the trunk. A 10 to 20 percent success
rate was reached in the treatment of infected trees (depending on the
stage of the rotting heart). Still, the disease is spreading and
trees are dying on a regular basis.

The disease has spread to the leeward side (carried by wind-driven
rains, rodents, insects, tree-trimming, and relocation of infected
palms from the windward side), but it is becoming invisible because
infected trees are being cut down. If unchecked it will slowly spread
around the islands and won't be able to be controlled, the arborist
said. He strongly urged individuals to assist in the prevention of
the spread of the disease. Now his company is looking to establish an
eradication and reforestation effort.

[Bud rot (also called heart rot) of coconut palm can be caused by
several species of fungus-like organisms in the genus _Phytophthora_,
as well as some fungal species (such as _Fusarium_, _Thielaviopsis_)
and bacterial species in the genus _Erwinia_. In both Ivory Coast and
Hawaii, _Phytophthora katsurae_ appears to be the main cause, while
in many parts of Asia, for example, _P. palmivora_ is prevalent.
These pathogens affect usually also several other palm species
including oilpalm. Heart rot is favoured by high rainfall and palms
of all ages can be affected.

Symptoms may include discolouration, wilting, collapse, and death of
young leaves, as well as drooping and distorted older fronds,
defoliation, stem end rot of nuts, premature nut drop, nut
discolouration, and rotting of the growth bud (heart rot) leading to
the death of the tree.

The _Phytophthora_ pathogens enter the host via the crown. They are
spread by wind splashed rain, mechanical means (including insect
activities), and with infected plant or other material. Disease
management of _Phytophthora_ species may include cultural practices
(phytosanitary measures, nutritional improvements), removal and
burning of severely affected palms, and fungicide treatments at or
before onset of symptoms. Treatments with phosphorous compounds, as
mentioned above, have also been shown to be effective against other
_Phytophthora_ diseases, for example jarrah dieback and avocado root
rot (both caused by _P. cinnamomi_) in Australia. The exact role of
these compounds in disease prevention remains to be clarified, but
they are thought to both inhibit metabolic processes of oomycete
pathogens and enhance the defence system of plants.
