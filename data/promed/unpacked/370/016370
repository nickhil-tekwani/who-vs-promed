Today, another five avian influenza (H7N7)-associated cases of human
conjunctivitis amongst workers in close contact with infected poultry
flocks were virologically confirmed. In our laboratories, virus diagnostics
are currently performed on samples taken from approximately 30 additional
individuals with conjunctivitis from the same area.
Results are expected to become available tomorrow.
