[In the past, both HPAI H7 and LPAI H7 epizootics have been recorded in the Netherlands. A full definition of the current H7 LPAI virus is expected.

"Birds" is a general, unspecified term; details on the (avian) animal species involved (chickens, turkeys, ducks, etc.) and their husbandry/production line (layers, pullets, free range, caged, etc.) are of significance for a meaningful epidemiological assessment of the event.
