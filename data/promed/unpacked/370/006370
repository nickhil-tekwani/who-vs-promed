South Korea Reports 3rd Death from MERS Virus
---------------------------------------------
An 82-year-old man has died of Middle East respiratory syndrome in South Korea, officials said on Thursday [4 Jun 2015]. His was the 3rd confirmed death in what has become the largest outbreak of the viral disease outside the Middle East.

More than 1160 schools and kindergartens in South Korea have been shut down temporarily, and many Koreans are wearing surgical masks in public out of fear of infection.

The government said in a statement that the man died on Wednesday [3 Jun 2015], and a posthumous test showed that he was infected with the MERS virus, making his the 36th confirmed case in South Korea.

As fears of the virus spread, the government of President Park Geun-hye has been accused of endangering the public by withholding information about the outbreak; the most recent criticism came from the influential mayor of Seoul, Park Won-soon.

In a news conference on Thursday [4 Jun 2015], Mr. Park assailed the national government for not disclosing that a doctor employed at a Seoul hospital who was quarantined with MERS symptoms on Sunday [31 May 2015] had attended a gathering of more than 1500 people in the southern part of the city the day before.

The health ministry announced earlier on Thursday [4 Jun 2015] that the doctor was the country's 35th confirmed MERS patient and that he had caught the virus from a patient he treated on [27 May 2015], but it did not mention the gathering.

"It increased the possibility that the virus spread and infected more people," the mayor said, calling the development a "grave situation." Mr. Park said city officials had begun phoning all those who had attended the gathering to ask them to quarantine themselves.

The government did not immediately respond to the mayor's criticism.

Its ability to contain the virus came under more scrutiny on Thursday [4 Jun 2015] with news of the 82-year-old man's death. He apparently caught the virus in a hospital, where he was being treated for asthma and pneumonia in late May [2015]. A new patient placed in his room was later found to be carrying the virus, and 3 others who stayed in the room have since tested positive, but an earlier test did not find the virus in him, officials said; he was under quarantine for further observation when he died.

Most of the MERS cases reported in South Korea so far are believed to have been infected in hospitals in Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul. The cases include staff members, patients and visitors. The government has refused to name the 6 hospitals in Gyeonggi and nearby cities where the patients were infected.

Health officials have raced to track down anyone who may have come into contact with known MERS patients, and have isolated more than 1660 people in their homes or at state-run facilities to see if they develop symptoms.

Worries about the virus appear to have spread to North Korea as well. On Thursday [4 Jun 2015], the South Korean government said that the North had asked to borrow heat-detecting cameras to help screen South Korean factory managers as they commute to an industrial park run jointly by the 2 countries in the North Korean border city of Kaesong. In the complex, 54 000 North Koreans work in 124 factories run by the South.

The industrial park is an important source of earnings for the North, and South Korean officials said there had been no indication that the North planned to close it temporarily because of the viral outbreak.

The South Korean government said it would lend 3 of the cameras to the North, as it did in November [2014] when North Korea tightened inspections at ports and airports and closed its borders to foreign tourists to guard against the Ebola virus. North Korea reopened the border to tourists in early March [2015].

Thousands of North Koreans are said to be working at building sites in the Middle East, where the virus 1st emerged in 2012. In all, more than 470 deaths have been linked to the virus, the vast majority of them in the Middle East.

[According to the above media report, there are presently 6 hospitals in South Korea that have had MERS-CoV cases. At least 4 of the hospitals were involved with care of the index case prior to diagnosis as MERS-CoV infected, and apparently 2 other hospitals where cases 14 and 16 have been admitted (and have been involved with 3rd generation cases as well).

Hopefully the doctor who attended professional meetings the day before he was isolated for MERS-CoV infection, was not shedding much virus in the environment where he was. It is daunting that they have identified approximately 1500 potential contacts at the meetings the physician attended.

Gyeonggi Province, where the majority of cases are, is the province surrounding Seoul and can be seen at http://www.mapsofworld.com/south-korea/provinces/gyeonggi.html. - Mod.MPP]

In the past 24 hours there have been 5 newly confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection including 1 death.

Of the 5 newly confirmed cases, 3 were in hospital B between 14-27 May 2015, 20-28 May with case 9, and 22-28 May with case 14 in the same ward.

The other 2 cases included one from hospital F 14-31 May 2015 in same hospital room as case no. 16, and the other visited the emergency room of hospital D where case 14 was admitted.

In addition, there was a fatality among a previously reported 76-year-old male who was in hospital B 15-17 May 2015 at the same time the index case was there. He deteriorated on 4 Jun 2014. He was initially admitted to the hospital with the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Listing of newly confirmed cases [includes case 36 who was confirmed on 4 Jun 2015, and cases 37-41 who were confirmed 5 Jun 2015]:

36: 82-year old male / 4 Jun 2015 / 28-30 May 2015 hospital roommate of case no. 16, fatality
37: contact with index case
38: contact at same hospital as index case
39: contact at same hospital as index case
40: contact with case no. 16
41: contact with case no. 14

[At the time of preparation of this report, the MOH line listing of 5 Jun 2015 newly confirmed cases was not available and the above list was generated using a sub-optimal machine translation of a description of the newly confirmed cases. In summary, since the last MERS-CoV update published on ProMED-mail, there have been an additional 6 cases reported. One was a fatal case diagnosed post-mortem (the 82-year-old male with significant underlying disease) who had been a roommate of case no. 16. Of the other 5 cases, 3 were secondary cases who had been admitted to hospital B at the same time as the index case, one had been a contact with case no. 16 in hospital F and the other had been a contact in the emergency room at hospital D where case no. 14 was admitted. In addition, a 76-year-old male who had previously been confirmed (case no. 3 from the S. Korean MOH line listing). The 76-year-old fatality was in an individual with severe cholangiocarcinoma, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.

[Noteworthy in the above report is that 7 of the 9 WHO confirmed cases from Saudi Arabia in the above report had been admitted to a hospital for other medical reason prior to the onset of their MERS-CoV infection related illness. Of the other 2 cases, one was a healthcare worker who had a history of caring for a MERS-CoV infected individual and the other had a history of exposure to camels and ingestion of camel milk in the 14 days preceding onset of illness. Seven of the 9 cases were from Hufof (Hufoof) and 2 from Taif. One of the cases from Taif was the sporadic case with a history of camel and camel milk contact, while the other was a nosocomial acquired case.

The information given confirms the observation of continued nosocomial transmission of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia.

In a collaborative effort between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) Ministry of Health, King Saud University and its affiliated academic hospital: King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, the US CDC, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, we have continued to monitor the evolution and transmission patterns of MERS-CoV.

Summary: A series of MERS-CoV infections occurred in February and March 2015 at King Khalid University Hospital (KKUH), Riyadh, KSA. As part of the outbreak investigation, upper respiratory samples from confirmed MERS cases and PCR positive contacts were amplified and subjected to deep sequencing with paired 149 nt Illumina MiSeq data followed by de novo assembly (see (1, 2)). 21 samples were processed with 18 samples yielding phylogenetically useful sequences and 8 yielding full MERS-CoV genomes (greater than 28000 nt). The novel 2015 MERS-CoV sequences are available at the following link. (http://tinyurl.com/MERS-CoV-4Jun15)

Disclaimer: These sequence data are being made publicly available with the hope that they are useful for other scientists and the caveat that they are preliminary and still undergoing quality control. A manuscript analyzing the phylogenetic patterns in more detail is in preparation. If investigators would like to use these sequence data for publication prior to release of our paper, please contact us.

Phylogenetic patterns: The 2015 MERS-CoV sequences cluster within a novel lineage related to the Hafr-Al-Batin_1 clade (Figure 1 [available at above given URL -- download the PDF file]. The genetic distance from other known MERS-CoV sequences is consistent with the novel lineage stemming from a separate zoonotic event. Spike protein changes. It is important to monitor evolution in the coronavirus spike region.

Changes in the spike protein accompanied the evolution of the SARS coronavirus and may be an important marker of increased transmissibility. None of the amino acid changes previously observed in the MERS-CoV spike protein in previous years have persisted and the proteins encoded by the recent Riyadh viruses are similar to the clade B ancestral sequence (Figure 2) [available at above given URL -- download the PDF file]. This suggests that at least in the current samples, there is no evidence that a spike variant has emerged in human infections that provides a selective advantage over the variants circulating in the animal reservoir.

Evolutionary rate: The updated inferred evolutionary rate of the virus is 9.29x10-4 (95 percent CI [confidence interval]: 7.19x10-4, 1.15x10-3). From the time-resolved phylogeny, the root of the tree (last common ancestor between human MERS and the Egyptian camels) is October 2010 (95 percent CI: January 2010, June 2011). The last common ancestor between clade A (EMC/2012 and JordanN3/2012) and B (rest of human isolates) is December 2010 (95 percent CI: March 2010, July 2011) and the root of clade B is December 2011(95 percent CI: July 2011, April 2012).

Figure Legends
Figure 1. Bayesian phylogeny of 170 MERS-CoV isolates inferred from a multiple sequence alignment of 30055 nucleotides. The phylogeny was generated using MrBayes v3.2.4 (3), running 3 Markov chain Monte Carlo runs for 2 000 000 states under a GTR+Gamma substitution model. The 18 new sequences from 2015 are marked in red, while those isolated from camels are in orange. The Al-Hasa hospital outbreak sequences are collapsed to a single node for clarity. Viral clades (or lineages, for HAB_1) are indicated in colored boxes. Posterior probabilities are shown for nodes with a support greater than 0.9. The scale bar indicates the genetic distance, in substitutions/site.

Figure 2. Protein changes in the spike encoded by recent MERS-CoV. All recent MERS-CoV spike ORFs were translated, the proteins were aligned and amino acid differences from the reconstructed ancestral Clade B protein were determined and marked by vertical colored bars and the changes observed in more than one genome are marked within the figure. Functional domains of the spike protein are indicated in the top panel and include the N-terminal domain, the receptor binding domain, the fusion domain (Fusion), the heptad repeats 1 and 2 (HR1 and HR2), the transmembrane (TM) and cytoplasmic (Endo) domain.
