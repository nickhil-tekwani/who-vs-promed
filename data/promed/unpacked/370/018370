The tragedy caused by heavy rains in Petrópolis in February [2022] triggered cases of leptospirosis, a bacterial disease associated with contact with contaminated water, reports the State Department of Health (SES; Secretaria de Estado da Saúde). In the first 3 months of [2022], Petrópolis recorded 99 probable cases of the disease, compared with only 3 notifications in the same period in [2021].

With the storms of recent days, the city hall issued an alert for the possibility of new cases of the disease. People who have had contact with water or mud from floods and who have fever associated with headaches or muscle pain should seek a health unit, reinforces the SES.

"It is very important that the population immediately seek medical attention if they present symptoms compatible with the disease. Health services should also pay attention to the inclusion of leptospirosis in the clinical suspicion and differential diagnosis of suspected cases of dengue and chikungunya. Historically, the notification of leptospirosis increases in periods of rain", says the secretary of state for health, Alexandre Chieppe, in a note sent to the press.

[Leptospirosis is a zoonotic bacterial infection that is widely distributed throughout the world in warm climates and is transmitted to humans by direct contact of abraded skin or mucous membranes with the urine of infected animals or by contact with wet soil, vegetation, or water that has been contaminated with infected animal urine. Leptospira bacteria shed in the urine of chronically infected animals may survive in freshwater or moist soil for weeks to months. Many species of wild and domestic animals (including dogs, cattle, swine, and especially rats) are susceptible to chronic kidney infection with pathogenic leptospira. Mice, as well as rats, can carry leptospira in their urine and serve as a reservoir for this organism (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6612401/).

There are more than 250 serovars of _Leptospira_ species, with multiple serovars being endemic in a given geographic area. Protective immunity against leptospira infection is predominantly serovar-specific. Different leptospiral serovars may be prevalent in particular geographical regions.

Human activities that place people at increased risk of leptospirosis include contact with rats or domestic animals (cattle, pigs, and dogs), walking barefoot in water or mud, swimming in rivers and other water sports, gardening, or farming, and working in piggeries (https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0242886). Some names for leptospirosis are derived from the environmental situations associated with or groups at risk of developing the disease, such as swineherd's disease, rice-field fever, canecutter's fever or disease, swamp fever, and mud fever. Outbreaks of leptospirosis frequently follow heavy rainfall, flooding with fresh water, and increasing rodent numbers. Inadequate disposal of trash and debris provides a suitable habitat for a rodent infestation.

The diagnosis of leptospirosis requires confirmation by MAT (microscopic agglutination test) serology, but an IgM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), IgM dipstick, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have been used to confirm the diagnosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3939550/). Dr Jan Clement has cautioned (see ProMED post Leptospirosis - Australia (03): (QL) comment 20210525.8380596) that Seoul hantavirus infection, also transmitted by rats, may be misdiagnosed as leptospirosis because its clinical manifestations mimic those of leptospirosis.

Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin and doxycycline) can be effective, especially if started early in the disease. Doxycycline (200 mg orally, once weekly) has been shown to be effective for short-term prophylaxis in high-risk environments (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198402233100805) for those exposed to contaminated floodwater or soil (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2018/infectious-diseases-related-to-travel/leptospirosis). Each 200-mg dose provides a benefit for up to 7 days, so the dose may be repeated if high-risk conditions persist longer than this. However, a Cochrane review of clinical research testing whether taking doxycycline can prevent leptospirosis found that data from trials, which "targeted different kinds of people -- travelers and people who live in at risk areas, encompassing soldiers, farmers, and students -- did not support the practice in all cases, though short-term travelers with a potential for high-risk exposure may be helped." (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD007342.pub2)

Although vaccines are available for immunizing non-human animals against some serovars of leptospira and are available in some countries for humans, no vaccine against leptospirosis is available for use in humans in the US.

Petrópolis (population almost 300 000 residents) is a city 68 km (42 mi) north east of Rio de Janeiro in the Southeast Region of Brazil. The city was once the summer residence of the Brazilian emperors and aristocrats in the 19th century. A map showing the location of Petropolis can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/search/Petrópolis+-+State+of+Rio+de+Janeiro,+Brazil/@-22.4838985,-43.2529976,12z.

In mid-Feb 2022, Petropolis experienced heavy rainfall -- 240 mm (9.4 in), in just 2 hours, followed by floods and 26 landslides, that killed 176 people, with more than 100 are missing (https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-60426163, https://www.bbc.com/news/world-60473918). Heavy rainfall and flooding recurred in mid-March (https://floodlist.com/america/brazil-floods-landslides-petropolis-march-2022 and https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-60825436).
