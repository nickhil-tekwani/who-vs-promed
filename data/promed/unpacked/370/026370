Re: ProMED-mail posting Salmonellosis, eggs - Australia (QLD): recall
20070303.0749
---------------------------------------------------------
This posting refers to a Sydney Morning Herald article which quotes
me in relation to the recall of eggs from a particular company in
Queensland, following their supply of cracked and dirty eggs and
links to a number of salmonella cases over several months.
Moderator LL states that 'The serotype of salmonellosis in this
cluster is not reported. Salmonellosis is often thought to be
associated with cracked eggs or eggs dirty with fecal matter, a
problem controlled by cleaning procedures implemented in the egg
industry. It is clearly the case, however, that most of the
salmonellosis outbreaks linked to eggs were associated with
uncracked, disinfected Grade A eggs, or foods containing such eggs.
The undamaged eggs become contaminated during ovulation, and thus
were contaminated with the bacteria before the egg shell was formed.'
This posting may lead readers to erroneously conclude that the
Queensland situation is an example of transovarial transmission. In
fact, the human cases referred to are of _Salmonella typhimurium_
[phage type] 197. Transovarial transmission almost uniquely involves
_Salmonella enteritidis_ (De Buck J. et al. Colonization of the
chicken reproductive tract and egg contamination by _Salmonella_. J
Appl Microbiol 2004; 97: 233-45). To my knowledge all outbreaks of
salmonella in Australia, to date, have been linked to the sale of
cracked or dirty eggs, as is the case in this instance.
