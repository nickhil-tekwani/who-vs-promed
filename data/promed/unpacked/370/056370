There was a single confirmed case of cholera in Minneapolis in a 46 year
old SE Asian female. As best could be determined she had not traveled out
of the country for the last several years, but did give a history of eating
raw snails the evening before presenting to the hospital. Here presenting
symptoms were odd in that she did not have the classical rice water stools,
but bloody yellow diarrhea. No other information is available at this time
in regard to this case.
