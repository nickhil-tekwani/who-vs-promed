Dengue cases in Brazil reach 135 000 in 2007
-----------------------------------------------
The total number of [dengue] cases in all of Brazil reported by the
Ministry of Health was 134 909 as of 26 Mar [2007]. The previous
total as of 12 Mar [2007] indicated 85 018 cases. This represents an
increase of 58.9 per cent in the number of cases in just 14 days.
Mato Grosso do Sul is in 1st place as the state most affected, with
41.18 percent of the occurrences (55 567 cases). Sao Paulo, which on
12 Mar 2007 was in 6th place, now goes to 2nd place, with 9.05
percent of the registered dengue cases (12 221).
The capital of Mato Grosso do Sul, Campo Grando, is the city most
affected in the country, with 46 082 cases. In the following order
were the municipalities of Dourados (3318 occurrences) and Tres
Lagoas (3512), also in MS. There were 20 confirmed DHF cases in the
state, with 4 deaths. Goias [state] had 17 DHF cases -- with 2 deaths
-- and Mato Grosso had 4 with one death.
In the Southeastern Region, 30 577 cases were registered, 40 percent
in Sao Paulo state. The municipalities most affected in Sao Paulo
[state] are: Bebedouro (941 cases), Birigui (819), Sao Jose do Rio
Preto (816) and Aracatuba (757). In Rio de Janeiro, 32 percent of the
8765 occurrences are located in the capital, and 14.72 percent in
Itaperuna. Of the 16 DHF cases in the southeast, 10 occurred in Rio
de Janeiro, with 4 confirmed deaths, 4 in So Paulo with one death,
and 2 in Minas Gerais with one death.
The Northeast is the 3rd most affected region, with 13.3 percent of
dengue cases (18 089). However, the greatest number of DHF cases
occurred in this region: 47 cases, with 24 in Maranho state, 16 in
Ceara, 4 in Pernambuco and 3 in Piaui state, with one death. The
states with the greatest number of reported dengue cases are Ceara
(5434 cases) and Maranhao (4227).
In the north, Tocantins state had the greatest number of cases
(4437), the capital Palmas having the most (1887), then Para state
(1755) and Amapa (830). Amazonas has the 4th smallest number, with
253 cases.
Parana had 97.44 percent of the [dengue] cases in the Southern
Region, the [region] least affected by dengue. It had 7801
occurrences, compared to 137 in Santa Catarina and 38 in Rio Grande
do Sul. The municipalities with the greatest number of cases in
Parana are: Ubirata (981), Maringa (816) and Foz do Iguacu (675).
According to the Ministry's totals, there have been no cases of DHF
in the Southern Region, but the Secretary of Health of Maringa
confirmed 2 instances of fever with one death.
Discrepancies between data provided by the Ministry of Health and
those provided by the Health secretariats of the municipalities occur
throughout Brazil. This is due to the fact that dengue case data
[collection] is regionalized, and there is a time lapse before they
are compiled by the Ministry [at the national level]. Thus, the
totals given by the Ministry are less than the current number of
cases in the country.
The final national dengue case total for 2006 from the Ministry's
announcement in January of this year [2007] was 345 922, with 642 DHF
cases, resulting in 71 deaths.

[ProMED thanks A-Lan Banks for a similar report. An additional report
published in O Estado de Sao Paulo, Brasil on 2 Apr 2007
<http://www.estado.com.br/editorias/2007/04/02/ger-1.93.7.20070402.1.1.xml>
indicated that this year (2007) up to 19 Mar 2007, 75 DHF cases with
10 deaths have been reported, for a case fatality rate of 13.3
percent. This report points out that this CFR is higher than the 3
percent reported by the World Health Organization, and the article
continues to report that in 2006, the CFR was similar, with deaths in
11 percent of the patients with this severe form of the disease. One
wonders whether there is significant underreporting of dengue cases,
particularly less severe dengue virus infections where infected
individuals do not seek attention at hospitals and health centers. It
would be interesting to know which of the 4 dengue virus serotypes
are circulating in Brazil this year (2007).

Fatmawati Hospital in South Jakarta is struggling to keep pace with a
large dengue outbreak, with 30 people administering [receiving? -
Mod.TY] treatment for the mosquito-borne disease on Monday [2 Apr
2007] alone.
Tempointeraktif reported that, as of Monday [2 Apr 2007], the
hospital was treating 152 patients, including 27 children. 36 late
arrivals are sleeping on foldable beds in the hospital's corridors
because the wards are full.
Hospital spokeswoman Rahmawati said dozens of dengue patients had
been admitted daily since last week.
From January through to February 2007, the hospital treated 1259
people for the disease. In March 2007 alone, it saw 861 dengue
patients. In January 2007, 8 patients died due to late treatment.

[ProMED requests any information available about action taken for
vector mosquito control or about the dengue virus type or types that
are circulating during this outbreak. A map of Indonesia can be

The WHO describes dengue fever as a severe, flu-like illness that
affects infants, young children, and adults but is seldom fatal. The
clinical features of dengue fever vary according to the age of the
patient. Infants and young children may have a non-specific febrile
illness with rash (although some infants and very young children may
develop shock syndrome, with sudden loss of circulating fluid volume,
and die). Older children and adults may have either a mild febrile
syndrome or the classical incapacitating disease, with abrupt onset
and high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and
joint pains, and rash.
Dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] is a potentially deadly complication
that is characterized by high fever, hemorrhagic phenomena -- often
with enlargement of the liver -- and in severe cases, circulatory
failure. The illness commonly begins with a sudden rise in
temperature accompanied by facial flush and other non-specific
constitutional symptoms of dengue fever. The fever usually continues
for 2 to 7 days and can be as high as 40-41 C (104-105.8 F), possibly
with febrile convulsions and hemorrhagic phenomena. In moderate DHF
cases, all signs and symptoms abate after the fever subsides. In
severe cases, the patient's condition may suddenly deteriorate after
a few days of fever; the temperature drops, followed by signs of
circulatory failure, and the patient may rapidly go into a critical
state of shock and die within 12-24 hours or quickly recover
following appropriate volume replacement therapy. There is no
specific treatment for dengue fever. However, careful clinical
management by experienced physicians and nurses frequently saves the
lives of DHF patients. With appropriate intensive supportive therapy,
mortality may be reduced to less than one percent. Maintenance of the
circulating fluid volume is the central feature of DHF case
management. (Abstracted from the WHO website fact sheet on dengue:
