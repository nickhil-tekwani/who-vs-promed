The district health department has stepped up surveillance after some cases of Japanese encephalitis (JE) were reported in Kokrajhar [Assam state].

The health department kicked off an awareness campaign to prevent the spread of the disease.

An 11 year old girl is the latest victim of JE. The district health surveillance officer, Amal Mushahary, said the girl is undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Guwahati and that her condition is improving. He said another case has been reported from the Gossaigaon area of the district. In June [2013], 2 people were diagnosed with JE [virus infections].

Mushahary said the infectious disease has been on the rise in the district over the years and villagers should urgently take steps to arrest its spread. Last year [2012], 13 people were diagnosed with acute encephalitis syndrome (AES). Of the 13 cases, 7 were found to be JE positive, he added; "3 persons died last year [2012], while others could not be traced due to inappropriate addresses of the patients," he said.

In 2011, 25 AES cases were reported in the district, of which 7 were diagnosed with JE [virus infections]; 4 succumbed to the disease.

"People should be most careful during June and July as these are months when spread of the disease is high," Mushahary said.

He urged the administration to take steps to control [transmission] of the disease in the district. "If no adequate steps are taken immediately, the disease will increase further as pigs, which are the amplifying hosts of the disease, are reared in most of the tribal households," he said.

[The etiologies of all the current cases above are given as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) infections. In previous years in Assam the etiologies of the encephalitis cases have not been clearly indicated. Some have been reported as JEV infections, others as AES. However, the total number of AES cases and deaths exceeds that reported for JEV infections. As in the situation in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh states, the etiologies of the AES cases are not given and apparently have not been determined.
