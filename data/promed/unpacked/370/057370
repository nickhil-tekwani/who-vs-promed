Influenza Update 242 - 27 Jul 2015, based on data up to 12 Jul 2015
--------------------------------------
Summary
Globally, the Southern hemisphere had increased influenza activity whereas influenza activity was at low levels in the Northern hemisphere.

In North America, Europe and temperate countries of Asia, influenza activity continued at low, inter-seasonal levels with influenza B predominating in sporadic detections.

In northern, middle, eastern and western Africa, only a few countries reported low levels of influenza activity with influenza type B predominating with low levels of co-circulation of influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2).

In tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean, overall influenza activity was reported to be at low, inter-seasonal levels with only Cuba reporting a slight increase in detections of influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09.

In western and temperate countries of Asia, low levels of influenza activity were reported with influenza B predominating with co-circulation of influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 in western Asia in recent weeks. Northern China reported a slight increase in detections of influenza type A(H3N2).

In tropical Asia, countries in Southern Asia reported elevated but decreasing influenza activity with influenza type A(H3N2) predominating. South East Asia reported low levels of activity with influenza type A(H3N2) predominating with co-circulation of influenza type A(H3N2) and B.

In temperate South America, influenza activity increased with influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 and type A(H3N2) predominating in recent weeks. Overall, influenza activity is following seasonal trends although at lower levels than in previous years. There was a sharp increase in influenza activity in Paraguay.

Influenza activity decreased in South Africa with influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) predominating in recent weeks.

In Australia and New Zealand, influenza activity continued to increase with both influenza type A(H3N2) and type B in circulation.

National Influenza Centres (NICs) and other national influenza laboratories from 68 countries, areas or territories reported data to FluNet for the time period from 29 Jun 2015 to 12 Jul 2015 (data as of 2015-07-27 12:46:00 UTC). The WHO GISRS laboratories tested more than 21 868 specimens during that time period. 2206 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 1680 (76.2 percent) were typed as influenza A and 525 (23.8 percent) as influenza B. Of the sub-typed influenza A viruses, 175 (12.9 percent) were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and 1178 (87.1 percent) were influenza A(H3N2). Of the characterized B viruses, 89 (94.7 percent) belonged to the B-Yamagata lineage and 5 (5.3 percent) to the B-Victoria lineage.

Countries in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere

North America
Overall, influenza activity remained at low, inter-seasonal levels. Both Canada and the United States had a slight increase in detections of influenza type B around the end of June 2015. Detections have since decreased. ILI (influenza-like illness) activity in Canada as well as pneumonia activity in Mexico remained slightly above expected levels for this time of the year.

Europe
All regions in Europe had low influenza activity with a few sporadic detections of a mixture of influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses in circulation. Most countries have reduced reporting during the inter-seasonal period.

Northern Africa
Northern African countries have ceased reporting since May 2015 with influenza detections at low levels at the time.

Western Asia
Western Asian countries all reported low influenza detections in recent weeks. The predominating virus this season was influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09; however, there was also co-circulation of influenza type A(H3N2) and B. Bahrain reported a slight increase in the number of ILI cases in recent weeks while reporting low levels of influenza type B in circulation.

Central Asia
Central Asia had low detections of influenza and ILI cases in recent weeks.

Eastern Asia
Countries in Eastern Asia reported low levels of influenza activity. Northern China had a slight increase in influenza detections in recent weeks; however, levels remained low. Influenza type A(H3N2) predominated in this region with influenza type B (Yamagata lineage) and type A(H1N1)pdm09 occurring at low levels. Japan, Mongolia, and the Republic of Korea all reported low levels of influenza activity in recent weeks.

Countries in the tropical zone

Tropical countries of the Americas/Central America and the Caribbean
The Andean Sub-region, Caribbean, and Central America countries overall reported low or decreasing influenza and RSV detections with the exceptions of a few countries. Cuba had increased detections of influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 while SARI (severe acute respiratory infections) cases remained elevated. Influenza type A(H3N2) and A(H1N1)pdm09 were the predominant viruses detected throughout the region.

Central African tropical region
Eastern and Middle Africa reported low levels of influenza activity with co-circulation of influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B. Influenza activity in Western Africa remained at low levels with influenza type B (Yamagata lineage) being the main strain in circulation in recent weeks. While influenza levels remained low, Senegal had a slight increase in influenza detections with influenza type B predominating. Influenza detections in Ghana decreased with influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09 and B (Yamagata lineage) predominating in recent weeks with low circulation of influenza type A(H3N2).

Tropical Asia
Southern Asia reported low levels of influenza detections and activity overall. Bhutan, India, and Iran had low levels of influenza activity with circulation of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B in recent weeks.

Southern China had elevated but decreasing ILI activity, however, influenza detections increased with influenza type A(H3N2) predominating and low co-circulation of both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and B (Yamagata lineage) viruses.

In China, since March 2015, the characterized influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically similar to the vaccine virus included in the 2015 Southern Hemisphere vaccine. The small number of influenza type B (Victoria lineage) viruses that were characterized were antigenically similar to the vaccine virus included in the quadrivalent vaccine. Most of the influenza B Yamagata lineage viruses were closely related to the vaccine virus recommended for the 2015 southern hemisphere vaccine composition.

In China, Hong Kong SAR, influenza activity peaked and began to decrease in recent weeks. The predominant virus in circulation was influenza type A(H3N2) which increased in proportion to the other types.

Sri Lanka reported decreasing influenza detections with the peak in activity occurring in the 2nd half of June 2015. The predominant virus in circulation was influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09.

South East Asian countries reported low levels of influenza activity. Lao People's Democratic Republic reported a slight increase in influenza detections, although activity remained at low levels. Influenza A(H3N2) predominated with low circulation of influenza B (Yamagata lineage). Singapore reported an influenza season with low activity and influenza type A(H3N2) as the predominant virus in circulation. Bangladesh reported low levels of influenza detections with the majority being influenza type A(H1N1)pdm09.

Countries in the temperate zone of the southern hemisphere

Overall, influenza activity increased in the Southern hemisphere except in South Africa.

Southern Africa
South Africa had decreasing influenza detections with predominance of both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2). There was low co-circulation of influenza B viruses as well. However, there was increasing pneumonia and influenza hospital admissions in recent weeks.

Oceania Melanesia and Polynesia
In Australia, influenza detections increased in recent weeks but remained within expected levels. Influenza B (Yamagata lineage) was the predominant virus in circulation during the last weeks with co-circulation of influenza A(H3N2) at lower levels. Influenza activity followed past national seasonal trends.

Influenza activity in New Zealand increased above their seasonal threshold but remained lower than their average seasonal level. Influenza-positive ILI and SARI case detections increased in recent weeks following seasonal trends. Both influenza type A(H3N2) and type B (Yamagata lineage) were in circulation and the viruses characterized thus far were antigenically similar to the vaccine virus recommended in the 2015 Southern Hemisphere trivalent vaccine. ILI activity remained low in both the Pacific Islands as well as French Polynesia.

Temperate South America
Temperate South America had increased levels of influenza activity which followed seasonal trends but was overall lower than in previous years. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) predominated in recent weeks with low circulation of influenza B. Within the region, both SARI and ARI activity increased.

Argentina had increased influenza activity following seasonal trends. However, influenza activity was lower than in previous seasons. RSV activity in Argentina was at elevated but decreasing levels.

Influenza activity in Chile was at low but increasing levels. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2), and B viruses co-circulated. Increased ILI detections followed the seasonal trend but have so far remained lower than in previous seasons. RSV levels have increased in recent weeks.

In Paraguay influenza activity had a sharp increase in recent weeks, and it was at high levels. ILI increased above expected levels. Both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2) were the predominant viruses with low circulation of influenza B. Increased ARI rates were most prominent in the northern populations of Paraguay. RSV activity decreased in recent weeks.

The Global Influenza Programme monitors influenza activity worldwide and publishes an update every 2 weeks.

The updates are based on available epidemiological and virological data sources, including FluNet (reported by the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System) FluID (epidemiological data reported by national focal points) and influenza reports from WHO Regional Offices and Member States. Completeness can vary among updates due to availability and quality of data available at the time when the update is developed.

[The record of seasonal influenza virus infection follows expectations during the course of the Southern Hemisphere seasonal outbreak. No new antigenic strains have appeared, and the imperfect match of the vaccine strain relevant to the epidemic virus has not had a marked affect. No information regarding the number of antineuraminidase-resistant strains is provided. It seems likely that the vaccine in production for the next winter epidemic will be adequate. In accordance, the ubiquitous pattern in the southern hemisphere epidemic is less severe than the northern hemisphere epidemics.

Up to the present, seasonal influenza remains responsible for the majority of non-lethal respiratory illnesses in the human population - Mod.CP]
