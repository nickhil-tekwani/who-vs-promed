The Bogor Institute of Agriculture (IPB) has declared an extraordinary outbreak of hepatitis after dozens of its students were confirmed to be suffering from the liver disease.

"There are 28 students that have been confirmed with hepatitis A. However, a recent health check shows that there are more students suspected of having the disease," IPB's deputy rector for academic and students affairs, Yonny Koesmaryono, said Fri 11 Dec 2015, as quoted by tempo.co. One of the students reportedly died after being treated in hospital for a few days. Three students reportedly left the hospital, while 2 were treated in their homes in Bogor.

In an attempt to control the outbreak of the disease, the Bogor Health Agency started conducting medical checkups for IPB students on Fri 11 Dec 2015. "The medical checkups will be held until Sun 13 Dec 2015," said Yonny. Out of 169 students that underwent the checkups on the 1st day, 11 of them were suspected of having hepatitis A and were, therefore, referred to Karya Bhakti Patiwi Hospital for further examination.

"They will be having blood and laboratory checks to determine whether they are suffering from hepatitis A," he said.

The Institute has reportedly been dealing with the disease since November 2015, after its students began being admitted one by one to hospital with hepatitis. The students reported symptoms like fatigue, nausea, vomiting, muscle aches, joint pain and mild fever.

[Hepatitis A is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus is spread by fecal-oral transmission. Hepatitis A is closely associated with inadequate sanitation and poor personal hygiene. Unlike hepatitis B and C, hepatitis A infection does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal, but it can cause debilitating symptoms. Hepatitis A occurs sporadically and in epidemics worldwide, with a tendency for cyclic recurrences. Waterborne outbreaks, though infrequent, are usually associated with sewage contaminated- or inadequately-treated water.

Casual contact among people does not spread the virus. In developing countries [where sanitary conditions are poor], most children experience infection in early childhood. As a consequence of poor sanitary conditions and hygienic practices, most children (up to 90 percent) have been infected with the hepatitis A virus before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not often experience any noticeable symptoms. Consequently, epidemics are uncommon because older children and adults are generally immune. Symptomatic disease rates in these areas are low, and outbreaks are rare. The positive hepatitis A test should be anti-HAV IgM for diagnosis; if it was just IgG, the process could be hepatitis E.

In developed countries with adequate sanitary conditions, prior to the availability of the hepatitis A vaccine, children often escape infection in early childhood. Ironically, these improved economic and sanitary conditions may lead to a higher susceptibility in older age groups, and because infections that occur in adolescents and adults are more often symptomatic, higher disease rates and large foodborne outbreaks may occur.

Bogor (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogor) is a city on the island of Java in the West Java province of Indonesia. The city is located in the center of the Bogor Regency, 60 km (37 miles) south of the Indonesian capital Jakarta, although it is administratively independent from that regency.
