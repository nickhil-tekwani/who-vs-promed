Recent shortages of immune globulin, a pharmaceutical of vital importance
for treatment of persons with certain immune deficiencies, have prompted
investigations by scientists and congressional representatives.
Congressional hearings are scheduled for next month.
Dr. Arthur Caplan, Chairman of the governmental Committee on Blood Policy,
is reported to have said: "I think there is in fact on the international
market hoarding and speculation that does adversely affect the availability
of this vital product." Dr. Caplan's committee has indicated that 6
American companies produce the immune globulin from donated plasma, and
sell approximately 20% of it in the international market. The producing
companies will be asked to explain the shortages that have been experienced
in the USA.
Jim Blaback of the International Plasma Producers Industry Association is
reported to have denied any knowledge of industry stockpiling practices
directed toward control of market price.
Several months ago the FDA is reported to have cautioned that physicians
are prescribing immune globulin inappropriately to treat illnesses for
which its efficacy has not been demonstrated. Chronic fatigue syndrome was
cited as an example. The FDA did order temporary suspension of production
by one large producer company last year in order to correct manufacturing
deficiencies.
Several batches of immune globulin are reported to be quarantined by the
companies because of fears of theoretical potential for transmission of
Creutzfeld Jakob disease. The FDA does not have the authority to compel
producers to sell stockpiled reagents. An FDA spokesperson has indicated
that physicians have toll-free telephone numbers that give them access to
emergency supplies of immune globulin.
