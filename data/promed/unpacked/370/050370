Authorities in the Ministry of Animal Resources and Fisheries for South Sudan's Lol State have declared an outbreak of animal disease known as lumpy skin disease after the deaths of 85 cattle have been reported in various locations across the state.

Lumpy skin disease is a viral disease of cattle that is spread by biting of insects such as flies or mosquitoes. It causes nodular skin [lesions] on the animal's body, high fever, unwillingness to eat, discharge from the eyes and nose, drop in milk production and weight loss.

Lol state's director of animal resources and fisheries Augustino Aguot Lueth Agany told Radio Tamazuj that a joint team from the ministry of animal resources and fisheries in collaboration with Concern Worldwide [an international charity fighting world poverty], VSF (Veterinarians Without Borders) and FAO have been dispatched on Tuesday last week [4 Oct 2016] to the most affected cattle camps at Chel Kou and confirmed the severity of the disease.

"Chel Kou is the main area of biggest outbreak where 4 bigger cattle camps and the population in those cattle camps are 11 000 herds of cattle. This is where 150 animals were affected and 80 died and the disease is suspected to be lumpy skin disease," said Aguot. "The team of veterinarians composed of VSF, ministry staff and Concern Worldwide went and investigated the case and was confirmed to be lumpy skin disease. Therefore we are advising our cattle keepers to use long antibiotic at the movement and the animals can be contained in outbreak areas until the vaccines come from Juba," Aguot cautioned the herders.

He says other areas have different cases with 5 deaths reported in Majak Baai, Gok Machar, Ariath and some parts around Nyamlel. Aguot pointed out that vaccination campaigns will take place tomorrow in the affected camps for other diseases while for lumpy skin disease the vaccination will be organized later when vaccines are received from Juba. The last animals' vaccination in the state was in March this year [2016]. The official urged the general public not to consume meats from dead cattle but instead to burn or bury them for the fear of getting contaminated from other diseases.

Meanwhile, a herder at Gok Machar, AM, claimed more than 7 cows died from his herds and called on animals resources ministry to contain the disease before it spreads to other areas in the county. "Yes this disease, we don't know its name, has killed a lot of cows here in Gok Machar. My cows (that died) are more than 7 leave alone other people in the area. When your cow starts dizzying and stops eating you forget it and this is how it killed cows here including big oxen. There are no animals' medicines and some of us use local herbs and antibiotic only," narrated AM in an interview to Radio Tamazuj this morning [13 Oct 2016].

[Lol, one of the 28 states composing South Sudan, is located in the Bahr el Ghazal region, in the western part of the country. Lol borders the Central African Republic to the west and Sudan to the north. Another media report addressed the spread of lumpy skin disease in Lol's south eastern neighboring state, Wau. This report was published on 14 Oct 2016 in the media platform of the Gurtong Trust ("an independent, not-for-profit South Sudan Peace and Media Project") quoting the same official and descriptions mentioned in the above report; see at http://www.gurtong.net/ECM/Editorial/tabid/124/ctl/ArticleView/mid/519/articleId/19930/Outbreak-Of-Lumpy-Skin-Disease-Reported-In-Wau.aspx.

Lumpy skin disease (LSD), an OIE-listed disease, is a pox disease of cattle caused by a capripoxvirus, characterised by fever, nodules on the skin, mucous membranes and internal organs, emaciation, enlarged lymph nodes, oedema of the skin, and sometimes death. The disease is of economic importance as it can cause a temporary reduction in milk production, temporary or permanent sterility in bulls, damage to hides and death due to secondary bacterial infections. Several capripox vaccines have been successfully applied against this virus. For additional information, see http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_LSD.pdf.

Various strains of capripoxvirus are responsible for the disease. These are antigenically indistinguishable from strains causing sheep pox and goat pox yet distinct at the genetic level. LSD has a partially different geographical distribution from sheep and goat pox, suggesting that cattle strains of capripoxvirus do not infect and transmit between sheep and goats. Transmission of LSD virus (LSDV) is thought to be predominantly by insects, natural contact transmission in the absence of insect vectors being inefficient.

Lumpy skin disease is regarded endemic in most African countries. As can be seen in OIE's distribution map for LSD (June-December 2015), LSD has been reported as present from 5 of South Sudan's 6 neighbours (Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and DR Congo); the 6th, western neighbor, Central African Republic (CAR), is colored as "never reported". An official reporting to the OIE on the current epizootic will change the color of South Sudan on the map from white ("no information") to pink. Map at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.04.13_LSD.pdf. In sub-equatorial Africa, Burundi reported 13 outbreaks during 2015, 9 of which during the 2nd semester of the year; Namibia has reported a recent upsurge. In view of the current epizootic in the western part of South Sudan, the LSD situation in CAR deserves to be checked.

Since the last decade of the 20th century, several LSD introductions into the Middle East were recorded and it became endemic in Egypt. Since mid 2015, LSD has been spreading in south eastern Europe, the Caucasus countries and southern Russia. An updated, interactive OIE map, showing all recorded LSD outbreaks since January 2015, globally, is available at http://tinyurl.com/zzqtmtd. - Mod.AS
