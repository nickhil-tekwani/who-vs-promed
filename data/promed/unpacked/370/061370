Classical swine fever in Japan: detection of vaccine cases (final report)
------------------------------
Information received on [and up to] 13 May 2004 from Dr Masako Kurimoto,
director of Animal Health and Animal Products Safety Division, Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Tokyo:
End of previous report period: 23 Mar 2004 (see Disease Information 2004;
17[13]: 94, 26 Mar).
There have been no outbreaks of classical swine fever in Japan since
December 1992. The reported vaccine cases did not constitute a disease
outbreak.
Prevention measures taken:
All pigs in the farm involved were culled and all other prevention
measures, such as disinfection, were completed by 30 Mar 2004. 6 farms that
were epidemiologically linked with the farm in question, and all farms
within a radius of 3 km of the farm involved (58 farms), have been
serologically tested and no other positive cases have been confirmed.
Investigations to date:
In Japan, vaccination against classical swine fever has been banned since 1
Oct 2000. Vaccination is allowed only in special cases, and must be
conducted under appropriate supervision with the permission of the
prefecture governor and with approved vaccines.
In the farm involved in the present incident, vaccine use was limited to
only a part of the herd. According to the gene analysis and monoclonal
antibody test carried out at the National Institute of Animal Health, the
viruses isolated from these pigs are different from the strains that are
authorised to be manufactured and sold in Japan for vaccine use. In
addition, the virus strains used for the production of approved vaccines
are produced using a "seed lot" system to prevent any mutation.
Furthermore, virus strains in the approved vaccines are adequately
attenuated, and lose horizontal infectivity. Therefore, the viruses
isolated from the farm in question cannot be mutated vaccine virus strains.
The manufacture of unapproved vaccine is banned in Japan. Pharmaceutical
inspectors regularly check vaccine manufacturing facilities. Therefore, we
are of the opinion that the viruses isolated on this occasion are not
derived from vaccine produced in Japan. In addition, since the import and
sale of foreign vaccines are banned, it seems that the vaccines used on the
farm were illegally imported into Japan. It is obvious that this event is
an exceptional one, however, since periodical serological surveillance of
as many as 8.5 million pigs a year, confirmatory diagnostic testing for
clinically abnormal pigs, clinical inspection of farms totalling more than
20 million animals a year and antemortem and postmortem tests for all pigs
at slaughterhouses have never detected any other cases. Detection of this
exceptional case means that the Japanese supervision system has been
functioning well.

The farmer involved has indicated an unapproved vaccine was indeed used,
but further questions still remain -- what kind of vaccine was used, where
was it obtained, and possibly most interesting of all, what was the
rationale in vaccinating only part of the herd? - Mods. PC/AS]
