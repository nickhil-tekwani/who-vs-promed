[2] Outbreak summaries

[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/11/news-scan-nov-08-2019

The US Agency for International Development (USAID) today announced an additional USD 56 million in humanitarian aid to help curb the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) Ebola outbreak.

According to a statement, the new funding brings USAID's total since the August 2018 start of the outbreak to USD 266 million. The support also targets preparedness efforts in the region and in countries that neighbor the DRC.

"With this funding, the United States is continuing to provide life-saving assistance through on-the-ground partners, including activities to prevent and control infections in health facilities, enhanced surveillance for the disease, training for healthcare workers, community-engagement efforts, the promotion of safe and dignified burials, and food to support people and communities affected by Ebola," USAID said.

Persistent transmission and the need for community buy-in has prompted the United States to expand its response to include critical needs in Ebola-hit communities, such as supporting primary healthcare facilities, rehabilitating water and sanitation systems, providing nutritional support, bolstering protection systems, and supporting economic recovery opportunities.

The United States is the largest single-donor country, and the country has a disaster assistance response team on the ground in the DRC that includes experts from USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In the USAID statement, the United States called on other countries to provide more financial and technical support to help end the outbreak and urged all countries that identify Ebola and other deadly diseases to report them promptly and transparently.

In other developments, no new Ebola cases were reported in the DRC today [Fri 8 Nov 2019], keeping the total at 3286 cases, 118 of them listed as probable, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard. Health officials are still investigating 531 suspected cases. The number of deaths held steady at 2191.

[WHO Emergencies preparedness, response, Disease Outbreak News (DONs), abridged, edited]
https://www.who.int/csr/don/07-november-2019-ebola-drc/en/

Fifteen confirmed cases were reported in the past week (30 Oct - 5 Nov 2019) in the ongoing Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. While the number of new cases is consistent with the weekly average of 19 confirmed cases in the past 21 days, there is notable daily fluctuation of cases.

Violence this week in Lwemba health area in Mandima health zone caused the death of an Ebola response community health worker and left his spouse critically injured. WHO and partners condemned the attack, adding that acts of violence against individuals involved with the response are unacceptable and compromise the ability of health workers to assist communities impacted by the devastating effects of Ebola.

During the past 21 days (16 Oct - 5 Nov 2019), 54 confirmed cases were reported from 7 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Figure 2, Table 1) with the majority reported in 4 health zones: Mandima (39%, n= 21), Mabalako (31%, n= 17), Beni (11%, n= 6) , and Mambasa (11%, n= 6). The vast majority (83%) of these cases were linked to Biakato Mines health area in Mandima health zone, with the remaining 10 cases linked to known chains of transmission in Binase, Katwa, and Lwemba health areas.

In this context, reintroduction into previously cleared or unaffected neighbouring areas can be expected, and possible geographical spread should be closely assessed and monitored. Approximately half (51%) of the cases reported in the past 21 days were located outside of the health zone where they got infected, with the majority of these movements going to or coming from Mandima health zone. An analysis of population movement indicates that travel within the region is directed eastward from Mambasa to Komanda and towards Bunia, southward between Mambasa and Mangina, and further south and southeast through Beni to Butembo, and all the way to Kasindi and crossing into Uganda. Points of entry and points of control continue to be strengthened by response teams based on movement of cases and populations. This week, a case was detected while traveling through a newly opened point of control, reinforcing the importance of enhancing screening along these major passages, transitways and border points. An example of reinforcement activities underway is the introduction of an EVD laboratory in Kasindi health area in the past week, close to the border with Uganda. This will facilitate the rapid identification of cases and earlier initiation of response activities.

As of 5 Nov 2019, a total of 3285 EVD cases were reported, including 3167 confirmed and 118 probable cases, of which 2191 cases died (overall case fatality ratio 67%). Of the total confirmed and probable cases, 56% (n= 1852) were female, 28% (n= 930) were children aged less than 18 years, and 5% (n= 163) were health workers.

http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/11/european-regulators-consider-2nd-ebola-vaccine
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

Bavarian Nordic today announced that it and partner Janssen Pharmaceuticals, part of Johnson & Johnson, have submitted an application to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for approval of their investigational 2-dose Ebola vaccine regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN Filo). The news comes as one new Ebola case was reported today in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) outbreak, part of a fluctuating pattern that the World Health Organization (WHO) noted today [Thu 7 Nov 2019] in its weekly snapshot of the event.

The application submission to the EMA for the Johnson & Johnson Ebola vaccine comes less than a month after the agency conditionally approved VSV-EBOV, the vaccine currently used in a ring vaccination campaign in the outbreak-affected areas.

In its announcement, Bavarian Nordic said that in September [2019] the EMA granted accelerated assessment, which will shorten the review time for the vaccine.

About 500 000 regimens of the vaccine, provided by Janssen, are in the DRC for use in a new clinical trial, and in an effort to help curb the outbreak, planned by the DRC government and its global health partners.

The company said Janssen is in discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration to define data for filing for approval of the vaccine under the agency's animal rule pathway. It also added that it is working with the WHO to enable registration of the vaccine in African countries.

The single new case follows 3 reported yesterday [Wed 6 Nov 2019] and 7 the day before [Tue 5 Nov 2019].

The latest confirmed infection, noted on the WHO's online Ebola dashboard, raises the overall outbreak total to 3286, which includes 118 probable cases. Health officials are still investigating 531 suspected infections.

Four more people died from their infections, lifting the fatality count to 2191.

The WHO said today in an outbreak update that 15 cases were reported for the week ending 5 Nov 2019, consistent with an average of 19 cases reported for each of the previous 3 weeks.

However, it said the daily fluctuation in cases is notable.

Most of the cases over the past 3 weeks are from 4 health zones, and the majority of those are from the Biakato Mines area in Ituri province's Mandima health zone. The rest are linked to known transmission chains in Binase, Katwa, and Lwemba health areas. Lwemba is where a violent attack recently occurred that killed an Ebola-response community health worker and severely injured his wife.

The WHO warned that spread to earlier affected or still unaffected neighboring areas is possible and expected and should be closely monitored. It added that about half of the people infected in the last 21 days were diagnosed outside of the health zone where they were exposed, mostly people traveling to or from Mandima health zone.

"This week, a case was detected while traveling through a newly opened point of control, reinforcing the importance of enhancing screening along these major passages, transitways, and border points," the WHO said. It added that an Ebola lab recently opened in Kasindi health area near the border with Uganda, which it said would help rapidly identify cases and enable an earlier response.

[3] Vaccine
- Thu 7 Nov 2019. Johnson & Johnson vaccine
[Pharmaceutical Technology, edited]
https://www.pharmaceutical-technology.com/news/janssen-ebola-vaccine/

Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Pharmaceutical has filed marketing authorisation applications (MAAs) with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the approval of an Ebola vaccine regimen.

The 2-dose regimen is intended to prevent Ebola virus disease (EVD) caused by Zaire ebolavirus species. Janssen submitted 2 MAAs for each vaccine in the regimen.

Based on Janssen's AdVac technology, Ad26.ZEBOV is the 1st dose of the Ebola vaccine regimen. The 2nd MVA-BN-Filo dose is based on MVA-BN technology from Bavarian Nordic. The doses are to be administered approximately 8 weeks apart.

For the vaccine regimen, adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) and Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara (MVA) are genetically modified to prevent replication in human cells. The vectors are also modified to generate one of the Ebola virus proteins to induce an immune response.

In the MAAs, Janssen included results from Phase I, II, and III clinical trials, which were conducted to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine regimen in adults and children.

The applications are also supported by data from preclinical studies and immunobridging analyses.

More than 6500 individuals in the US, Europe, and Africa have participated in more than 10 trials of the Ebola vaccine to date.

Janssen Pharmaceutica global therapeutic area head Johan Van Hoof said: "Our goal is to deliver a vaccine that can be used both in response to Ebola outbreaks and also more proactively as a prophylactic tool to help countries protect their populations."

This September [2019], EMA's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) awarded an accelerated assessment for the MAAs.

Janssen is in discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about the data set necessary to seek approval for its vaccine regimen. The company also partnered with the World Health Organization (WHO) to register the product in African markets.

[4] South Kivu discontent
- Thu 7 Nov 2019. Communicators' salary
[Crofs blog via Radio Okapi, abridged, edited]
https://crofsblogs.typepad.com/h5n1/2019/11/drc-more-than-60-ebola-response-communicators-demand-salaries.html

More than 60 communication service agents in the Ebola response to Butembo (North Kivu) claim payment of 3 months' salary in arrears. They told the press [Tue 5 Nov 2019] after the hearing they had with the coordinator of the response of this epidemic.

According to their spokesman, Anselme Bulio, all the communicators of the 12 health zones of the Butembo sub-coordination are concerned by this problem.

"We waited for 3 months because the coordination made us firm promises. But since then, nothing is done," he said.

They granted 48 hours, which expires on [Thu 7 Nov 2019], to the coordination of response to regularize this situation. Otherwise, they promise to go on strike.

No new cases of Ebola have been detected since 1 Oct 2019, according to the sub-coordination of the response to the epidemic in the city of Butembo.

Which reminds communication service agents that they will not be paid.

"Since there are no more cases in the Butembo sub-coordination, we feel that we do not want to pay our arrears of 3 months' salary. That's why we maintain our demands to be paid," said Anselme Bulio.

For his part, the Butembo Ebola response coordinator, Dr. John Kombe, did not want to respond to this concern. He believes that it is up to the mayor of the city, as an urban authority, to respond to these concerns.

Attacks on Ebola response 15-31 Oct 2019

In Ituri and North-Kivu provinces, insecurity is limiting Ebola responders' access, posing challenges for the Ebola health response. Less than 5 out of 16 health facilities are operational in Luengba due to the presence of Mai-Mai militias. Newly confirmed cases appear to be concentrated in areas impacted by insecurity and lack of access.

- Mon 4 Nov 2019. Ebola attacks
[AFP, abridged, edited]
https://tinyurl.com/yyk4we3b

Health workers battling an Ebola outbreak in the DR Congo have been attacked 300 times, leaving 6 dead and 70 wounded since the start of the year [2019] in 3 provinces, authorities said on Monday [4 Nov 2019].

The Democratic Republic of Congo declared an Ebola epidemic in August 2018 in the conflict-wracked eastern provinces of North Kivu, South Kivu, and Ituri, bordering Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi.

The highly contagious fever has so far killed 2185 people, according to the latest official figures, but health workers have faced attacks and threats.

The latest attack occurred in the early hours of Sunday [3 Nov 2019] after a Congolese radio host, who helped spread information in the fight against Ebola, was stabbed to death at his home in the Ituri region.

In April [2019], a Cameroonian doctor from the World Health Organization (WHO) was shot dead in an attack on a hospital in North Kivu province.

A report from the Congolese health ministry said since 1 Jan 2019 there had been "more than 300 attacks on health workers," which had killed 6 people and injured 70 others, among them healthcare workers and patients.

The report also warned "each attack delays" efforts to fight Ebola as it prevents teams having access the population to carry out planned interventions.

"In any case, the response team will continue to fight this disease with the involvement of communities and the affected population, including the support of all partners involved," authorities said.

Efforts to roll back the epidemic have been hampered not only by fighting but also by resistance within communities to preventative measures, care facilities, and safe burials.
