["Brucellosis is the generic name used for the animal and human infections caused by several species of the genus _Brucella_, mainly _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis _ and _B. suis_.

"Infection with _Brucella_ in pigs is due to _B. suis_ biovars 1-3, but the disease caused by biovar 2 differs in its host range, its limited geographical distribution and its pathogenicity. In some areas, _B. suis_ infection has become established in wild pigs.

"Clinically, infection with _Brucella_ in animals is characterised by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Unequivocal diagnosis depends on the isolation of _Brucella_ from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem.

"_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and potentially contaminated tissues, cultures and materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions" (Source: OIE Terrestrial Manual 2019, Chapter 3.1.4 Brucellosis (_Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_) https://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/3.01.04_BRUCELLOSIS.pdf).

"_B. suis_ is common in domesticated pigs in some parts of the world, such as Asia and Latin America. This organism has been virtually eradicated from commercial herds in some other regions; however, it is still maintained in wild or feral swine in many of these areas, including North America and Europe. This complicates brucellosis control, especially for domesticated pigs kept outdoors. In addition, clinical cases are sometimes reported in hunting dogs and people who hunt wild pigs. Occasionally, organisms from wild suids infect other livestock such as cattle, resulting in additional risks to human health. _B. suis_ has also been weaponized, and there are concerns that it could be used in a bioterrorist attack" (Source: Spickler AR. 2018.
