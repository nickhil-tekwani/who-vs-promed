Already under assault from a variety of diseases, algal blooms, and
deadly sponges, the Keys reef tract is facing yet another threat.
Scientists recently have discovered a disease that quickly kills
staghorn coral, a species whose populations are in drastic decline.
"This is definitely just one more wake-up call that our reefs are not
doing well in some areas and our oceans are sick," said Billy Causey,
superintendent of the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. "What
this tells me is that our reefs are extremely vulnerable, and what
affects them is really complex. There's no one problem."
NOAA-Fisheries ecologist Margaret Miller and University of Miami
postdoctoral associate Dana Williams discovered the disease in late
April 2003 at White Banks North and White Banks South patch reefs off
Key Largo.
"We were rather heartbroken," Miller said. "We were doing basic
monitoring of juvenile colonies of staghorn, and they were growing
really well, but then they started dying like flies. We sort of
said, 'Hmm, this looks bad.' Over the next couple of weeks, mortality
progressed very rapidly. We talked to the sanctuary and they said,
'Hey, something's going on.' "
Sanctuary officials closed the reefs to all human activity in July
2003 for 2 months.
Researchers at Hollings Marine Laboratory in Charleston, S.C., are
studying infected staghorn tissue but have not determined what causes
the disease. Neither have researchers named it. Staghorn coral is
one of the hardest-hit species in the Keys and throughout the
Caribbean basin. Populations have declined by up to 95 percent in
some locations.
Earlier this month, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned
the federal government to put staghorn and its close relatives, fused
staghorn and elkhorn, on the Endangered Species List. The disease
also might have infected elkhorn and fused staghorn corals.
"It's difficult to tell because we don't know exactly what we're
looking at," Williams said. "We've seen disease signs that look
remarkably similar in terms of how it kills. It's definitely
everywhere and probably has been, but at a low level. Then sometimes
it seems to spread more rapidly."
Historically, staghorn coral's greatest enemy has been white band
disease, but the newly discovered disease kills more quickly.
"Coral fragments 6 to 8 inches long die within 4 or 5 days," Miller
said. "Semi-large colonies, 1/2 a meter to 3/4 of a meter, are 2/3
dead in 2 weeks. It's depressing to watch. By comparison, white band
disease spreads only a few millimeters a day."
Experiments at White Banks show that a diseased section of coral can
infect a healthy section by direct contact. Miller and Williams also
found that the small coral snail, a natural coral predator, can
spread the disease, but the disease cannot be spread by humans.
At this point, scientists don't know what the long-term effects of
the disease will be.
"That's the $64 000 question," Miller said. "But it's a good reminder
that these outbreaks can pop up without notice, and we don't
understand how, when, or where. These outbreaks are unpredictable and
can have a rapid, drastic impact at individual sites."
