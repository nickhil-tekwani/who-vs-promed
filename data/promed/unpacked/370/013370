Situation summary in the Region of the Americas
-----------------------------------------------
All 54 countries and territories in the Region of the Americas have reported COVID-19 cases and deaths. As of [22 Aug 2020], there are more than 12.3 million cases of COVID-19, including approximately 439 000 deaths, which is nearly [three times as many] reported cases and almost twice the number of reported deaths as noted on 22 Jun 2020 (4.4 million cases, including 224 000 deaths). Of the almost 8 million new cases reported in the prior 2 months, 73% were reported by [two countries]: the United States of America [accounted for ] 42% and Brazil 31%. These 2 countries also account for 54% of the new deaths reported; 29% of the new deaths were reported by Brazil and 25% by the USA, followed by 18% [by] Mexico and 9% [by] Peru.

The countries and territories with the highest cumulative incidence rates are French Guiana (2945 cases per 100 000 population) and Chile (2070/100 000), followed by Panama, Peru, the USA, Brazil, and Aruba, which each reported a cumulative incidence rate greater than 1000/100 000 (see Map 1A). The countries with the highest cumulative per capita death rate as of [22 Aug 2020] are Peru (83 deaths per 100 000 population), Chile (56/100 000), Brazil (53/100 000), and the United States of America (53/100 000) (see Map 1B).

In the Region of the Americas, while COVID-19 cases seem to have steadied in some countries and territories at the national level (such as the USA and Canada), daily notification rates are now accelerating in other countries and territories, many of which are experiencing larger outbreaks for the 1st time since the onset of the pandemic in the Region (such as countries and territories in the Caribbean subregion). A decreasing trend in the daily incidence of cases is mainly from countries in the North America subregion, primarily the United States of America (see Figure 2: Distribution of new COVID-19 cases by epidemiological week (EW) of report and by country/territory. Region of the Americas. EW 4-EW 34, 2020 [19 Jan-22 Aug 2020]). Trends throughout this report should be interpreted with caution as they are dependent on a number of factors which vary considerably between countries and territories (such as testing rates, case definitions, time delays between diagnosis, laboratory results, and official notification, etc).

- North America
The North America subregion, which consists of Canada, Mexico, and the USA, accounts for 50% of the total cases and 55% of the total deaths reported to date in the Region of the Americas. Of the approximately 3.7 million new cases, including the almost 93 000 new deaths, reported in the subregion in the [last] 2 months, [most] of the new cases were reported by the USA (89%), followed by Mexico (10%) and Canada (1%). With regard to the new deaths, approximately 58% were reported by the USA, 41% by Mexico, and 1% by Canada. All 3 countries have reported community transmission per the WHO classification for COVID-19 transmission category.

Notification of daily COVID-19 cases began increasing in epidemiological week (EW) 11 of 2020 [8-14 Mar 2020] and reached a peak in EW 30 [19-25 Jul 2020], when 516 070 new cases were reported, primarily from the USA (see Figure 3: Distribution of COVID-19 cases by epidemiological week (EW) of notification. North America subregion. EW 11-EW 34 2020 [8 Mar-22 Aug 2020]). Since then, the daily notification of cases has gradually declined, with a total of 349 737 cases reported during EW 34 [16-22 Aug 2020], a 32% decrease compared to the peak shown in Figure 3.

North America's decrease in daily case notifications is due in large part to the decreasing trend in daily cases in the USA, which had its 2nd peak at the end of July [2020]. Per the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US CDC), the percentage of respiratory specimens testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 decreased from 6.9% in EW 32 [208 Aug 2020] to 6.3% in EW 33 [9-15 Aug 2020], and decreased or remained the same in 9 of 10 Health and Human Services regions.

In Canada, average daily case counts at the national level have remained stable over the past 3 weeks, and the numbers of hospitalizations and deaths remain low overall. In Mexico, the daily notification of cases appears to be on a downward trend, with 5481 cases reported on [22 Aug 2020] (7-day moving average), compared to the 7-day average of 7022 cases reported on [2 Aug 2020], a 22% relative decrease.

- Central America
As of [22 Aug 2020], the total confirmed cases (around 266 000) and deaths (7203) have each increased by over 300% in the Central America subregion, compared to the totals (61 058 cases and 1580 deaths) reported in the last PAHO/WHO COVID-19 Epidemiological Update on [23 Jun 2020]. Of the almost 205 000 new cases reported in the last 2 months, the majority were reported by Panama (29%), Guatemala (27%), and Honduras (20%). The same 3 countries also made up the majority (83%) of new deaths reported in the subregion, with Guatemala accounting for the highest proportion (36%), followed by Panama (24%) and Honduras (23%). Belize and Costa Rica experienced the highest relative increases in cases compared to the total number of cases reported as of the last PAHO/WHO COVID19 Epidemiological Update on [23 Jun 2020]: a 29-fold increase in Belize (626 new cases) and a nearly 15-fold increase in Costa Rica (about 30 000 new cases). Costa Rica also experienced a 28-fold increase in deaths (328 new deaths) compared to the total number of deaths reported as of [23 Jun 2020].

Notification of daily COVID-19 cases began increasing in EW 13 [22-28 Mar 2020] and reached a peak in EW 30 ([19-25 Jul 2020]), when 29 795 new cases were reported, primarily from Guatemala, Panama, and Honduras (see Figure 4: Distribution of COVID-19 cases by epidemiological week (EW) of notification. Central America subregion. EW 10-EW 34 2020 [1 Mar-22 Aug 2020]). After a 15% decrease in cases during EW 31 [26 Jul-1 Aug 2020], the next substantial difference in the weekly notification of cases occurred between EW 33 and EW 34 [9-22 Aug 2020], when an 8% decrease was observed (see Figure 4).

In the Central America subregion, Panama has reported the highest cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases (1913 cases per 100 000 population), followed by Costa Rica (571100 000) and Honduras (515/100 000). The highest rates of cumulative deaths per capita were reported by Panama (41 deaths per 100 000 population), Honduras (16/100 000), and Guatemala (14/100 000). To date, all 7 countries in the Central America subregion have reported community transmission per the WHO classification for COVID-19 transmission category. Belize was the last country in the subregion to join that classification rank, when they declared community transmission on [20 Aug 2020] with 553 confirmed cases including 5 deaths.

- Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean Islands
The Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean Islands subregion reported more than 100 000 new cases, including 1384 deaths, since the last PAHO/WHO COVID-19 Epidemiological Update [23 Jun 2020], a 230% and 123% increase in cases and deaths, respectively. 80% of new cases reported in the last 2 months were from the Dominican Republic (59%) and Puerto Rico (21%). The Dominican Republic reported 64% of the new deaths, followed by Puerto Rico (17%) and Haiti (8%). In addition to the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, French Guiana, and Haiti, the countries and territories of Aruba, Sint Maarten, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and the US Virgin Islands now also have community transmission.

In this subregion, the notification of daily COVID-19 cases began increasing in EW 12 of 2020 [15-21 Mar 2020] and reached a high of 15 636 new cases reported in EW 31 [26 Jul 2020-1 Aug 2020], primarily from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico (see Figure 5: Distribution of COVID-19 cases by epidemiological week (EW) of notification. Caribbean and Atlantic Ocean Islands subregion. EW 10-EW 34 [1 Mar-22 Aug 2020]).

The weekly number of new cases has been fluctuating since EW 31 [26 Jul-1 Aug 2020], with a 15% decrease in EW 32 [2-8 Aug 2020], a 10% increase in EW 33 [9-15 Aug 2020], followed by a 10% decrease in EW 34 [16-22 Aug 2020], relative to the previous weeks (see Figure 5). Countries and territories such as Aruba, the Bahamas, Sint Maarten, Trinidad and Tobago, and Turks and Caicos generally began reporting an increase in the daily number of cases since the last report, with an acceleration in cases reported in the last 2 weeks; all of which relaxed their social distancing and public health measures in July [2020], including the re-opening of airports.

- South America
Following North America, South America remains the subregion with the highest number of confirmed cases and deaths reported to date. As of [22 Aug 2020], the 10 countries in the subregion have reported a combined total of more than 5.6 million cases, including close to 186 000 deaths, nearly 3 times as many cases and more than twice the number of deaths as reported on 23 June 2020 (about 1 780 000 cases, including about 71 500 deaths). All of the countries have reported community transmission except for Uruguay (clusters of cases).

The shape of the epidemic curve in South America (see Figure 6: Distribution of COVID-19 cases by epidemiological week (EW) of notification. South America subregion. EW 10-EW 34 [1 Mar-22 Aug 2020].) is largely attributed to the situation in Brazil, which has the 2nd highest number of cumulative cases and deaths reported to date at both the global and regional levels. Of the 3.8 million new cases reported in the last 2 months, Brazil accounts for the highest proportion of cases (64%), followed by Colombia (12%), Peru (8%), and Argentina (7%). Similarly, of the 106 000 new deaths, the highest proportions were reported by Brazil (55%), Peru (17%), and Colombia (13%).

In South America, the weekly notification of COVID-19 cases began increasing in EW 13 of 2020 ([22-28 Mar 2020]) and reached a high of more than 530 000 new cases reported in EW 33 [9-15 Aug 2020], primarily from Brazil, Colombia, and Peru (see Figure 6). A 10% decrease in cases was observed in EW 34 [16-22 Aug 2020].

Comorbidities and age as risk factors for COVID-19
--------------------------------------------------
Comorbidities and outcomes among COVID-19 reported cases in Latin America and the Caribbean
As part of the incident management system established to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries of the Region of the Americas have reported individual-level data for COVID-19 probable and confirmed cases, including demographic, clinical, and epidemiological characteristics, as well as information on potential risk factors for both SARS-CoV-2 infection and complications following infection [details available at source URL above -- downloaded document]

COVID-19 among indigenous populations
-------------------------------------
From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Region of the Americas and until 22 Aug 2020, 93 622 confirmed cases, including 1893 deaths (2.0%), were reported among indigenous peoples or communities in 11 countries for which information was available in the Americas.

Comparing the current data with the data published in the PAHO/WHO Epidemiological Update on [5 Aug 2020], 14 the highest relative increase in the number of cases has been observed among the indigenous peoples of Colombia, followed by Ecuador and Brazil. With regards to the number of deaths, the highest relative increase has been observed in Ecuador, followed by Colombia (see Table 1: Number of confirmed cases and deaths of COVID-19 among indigenous peoples in the Region of the Americas. 1 Jan to 21 Aug 2020.)

[The region of the Americas has been the hardest hit of the WHO regions with the USA, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, and Peru among the dominant countries globally. The report above highlights the toll taken on the smaller populated countries and territories in the region. The increase in the Caribbean countries has been attributed to the opening up of the countries to tourism again and, as seen in other regions, opening up of restrictions has led to vacationers who are behaving as though the virus is no longer a threat. - Mod.MPP]

[2] Northern hemisphere: influenza concerns
Date: Wed 26 Aug 2020 5:11 PM CEST
Source: NBC News, Associated Press (AP) report [abridged, edited]
https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/southern-hemisphere-covid-19-lockdowns-blocked-flu-will-work-north-n1238188


Winter is ending in the southern hemisphere and country after country -- South Africa, Australia, Argentina -- had a surprise: Their steps against COVID-19 also apparently blocked the flu. But there's no guarantee the northern hemisphere will avoid twin epidemics as its own flu season looms while the coronavirus still rages.

"This could be one of the worst seasons we've had from a public health perspective with COVID and flu coming together. But it also could be one of the best flu seasons we've had," Dr Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press. US health officials are pushing Americans to get vaccinated against the flu in record numbers this fall [2020], so hospitals aren't overwhelmed with a dueling "twindemic".

It's also becoming clear that wearing masks, avoiding crowds, and keeping your distance are protections that are "not specific for COVID. They're going to work for any respiratory virus," Redfield said. The evidence: ordinarily, South Africa sees widespread influenza during the southern hemisphere's winter months of May through August. This year [2020], testing tracked by the country's National Institute of Communicable Diseases is finding almost none -- something unprecedented.

School closures, limited public gatherings, and calls to wear masks and wash hands have "knocked down the flu", said Dr Cheryl Cohen, head of the institute's respiratory program. That not only meant lives saved from the flu's annual toll, but it "freed up our hospitals' capacity to treat COVID-19 patients," Cohen added.

In Australia, the national health department reported just 36 laboratory-confirmed flu-associated deaths from January [2020] to mid-August [2020], compared with more than 480 during the same period last year [2019]. "The most likely and the biggest contributor is social distancing," said Dr Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney.

The coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] is blamed for about 24 million infections and more than 810 000 deaths globally in just the 1st 8 months of this year [2020]. A normal flu year could have the world's hospitals dealing with several million more severe illnesses on top of the COVID-19 crush. Back in February and March [2020], as the worldwide spread of the new virus was just being recognized, many countries throughout the Southern Hemisphere girded for a double whammy. Even as they locked down to fight the coronavirus, they made a huge push for more last-minute flu vaccinations. "We gave many more flu vaccinations, like 4 times more," said Jaco Havenga, a pharmacist who works at Mays Chemist, a pharmacy in a Johannesburg suburb.

Some countries' lockdowns were more effective than others at stemming the spread of the coronavirus. So why would flu have dropped even if COVID-19 still was on the rise? "Clearly the vigilance required to be successful against COVID is really high," said CDC's Redfield. "This virus is one of the most infectious viruses that we've seen." That's in part because 40 per cent of people with COVID-19 show no symptoms yet can spread infection, he said.

Flu hasn't disappeared, cautioned a World Health Organization report earlier this month [August 2020]. While "globally, influenza activity was reported at lower levels than expected for this time of year", it found sporadic cases were being reported. Plus, some people who had the flu in southern countries might just have hunkered down at home and not seen a doctor as the coronavirus was widespread, WHO added. But international influenza experts say keeping schools closed -- children typically drive flu's spread -- and strict mask and distancing rules clearly helped.

"We don't have definitive proof, but the logical explanation is what they're doing to try to control the spread of (the coronavirus) is actually doing a really, really good job against the flu as well," said Richard Webby of St Jude Children's Research Hospital, who is part of a WHO committee that tracks flu evolution.

In contrast, the US and Europe didn't impose coronavirus rules nearly as restrictive as some of their southern neighbors -- and in many cases are reopening schools and relaxing distancing rules even as COVID-19 still is spreading and the cooler months that favor influenza's spread are fast approaching. So the US CDC is urging record flu vaccinations, preferably by October [2020]. Redfield's goal is for at least 65 per cent of adults to be vaccinated; usually only about half are.

[The topic of influenza season has been forefront on the minds of healthcare personnel. It is not known how influenza and SARS-CoV-2 will affect each other when co-circulating in the environment. It appears from this report and others that flu cases are down in the southern hemisphere. Whether this is due to lockdown plus use of PPE will become clear as the flu season begins in the northern hemisphere.

Last year (2019), the US CDC estimated that between 39 and 56 million flu illnesses occurred in the United States. These resulted in between 410 000-740 000 hospitalizations and 24 000-62 000 flu deaths.

Currently, the United States has seen more than 5.6 million COVID-19 cases and 175 650 deaths. More than 142 000 healthcare personnel have become ill and 705 have died due to the disease.

We know that people can be co-infected with multiple respiratory viruses, but we don't know how common infection with both influenza and SARS-CoV-2 will be (excerpted and edited from https://www.infectioncontroltoday.com/view/influenza-season-and-covid-19-what-should-we-expect; communicated by Mod.LK]

[These countries were selected on account of having had significant surges of SARS-CoV-2 infections but having responded differently. In some cases, transmission was almost interrupted, but resurgences have occurred, and countries have handled them differently. Lifting of restrictions has led to major resurgences in some areas; in others, early new threats seem to be importations, but community spread does recur. Good contact tracing has helped to shorten the time with new clusters, and temporary new restrictions have had an impact. Countries not implementing restrictions have done more poorly, with major resurgences and more widespread community-based transmission.

In South Korea, it looks like major transmission is continuing. Previously, when there were major events, time-limited increased restrictions were implemented, and as of 21 Aug 2020, they are being implemented again. A key takeaway message is that the virus is still circulating globally, and relaxing of the guard (eliminating simple measures of social distancing, face masks, hand washing, and large gatherings) is an open invitation for the virus to re-enter with clusters of cases and ultimately community transmission. - Mods.MPP/UBA]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215.

Data by country, area, or territory can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesAug27_1598567045.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 46.9% of daily case numbers and 63.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its dominance as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 12.7 million cases. The USA and Brazil still dominate with Colombia, Argentina, Peru, and Mexico very active as well.

- The European region reported 12.6% of daily case numbers and 6.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.1 million. Spain dominates followed by France, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Germany, Turkey, Romania, Italy, and the UK. 5 western European countries have returned to prominence. Israel did not report any cases in the past 24 hours.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.9% of daily case numbers and 4.8% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.8 million cases. Iraq still dominates followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Palestinian Authority, Lebanon, and Libya.

- The African region reported 2.5% of daily case numbers and 4.1% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and have reported more than 1 million cases. South Africa had the highest number of cases in the last 24 hours followed closely by Ethiopia, Algeria, Namibia, Zambia, Nigeria, and Kenya.

- The Western Pacific region reported 2.6% of daily case numbers and 2.3% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.47 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 30.5% of the daily newly reported cases and 18.3% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 3.8 million cases. India continues to dominate, followed by Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Nepal.

Impression: The overall picture by region is basically the same. The ordering of the regions has the Americas having the highest disease load and newly confirmed cases on a daily basis followed by the South East Asia region, then Europe followed by the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by the Africa region, and the Western Pacific region representing the lowest daily caseload of all the regions. While regional proportions may not reflect this, most of the regions have countries with resurgences associated with lifting of restrictions; noteworthy are Western European countries.

On the overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 27 Aug 2020, is the same epidemic curve included in the previous situation updates and is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic as described in the text above. - Mod.MPP]

In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (76 826), followed by the USA (46 269), and Brazil (42 489) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (53.6%). There were 5648 deaths reported in the past 24 hours (26-27 Aug 2020).

In descending rank order, India is number one for the number of newly confirmed in the past 24 hours, followed by USA, Brazil, Spain, Argentina, Colombia, France, Mexico, Russia, and Iraq. The range in the top 10 daily newly confirmed goes from 3651 to 76 826. Other hotspots are seen in the countries numbered 11-20 in this list: Philippines, Indonesia, South Africa, Bangladesh, Iran, Israel, Ukraine, Chile, Germany, and the UK, and their range of reported new cases is 1522 to 3220. A total of 28 countries have reported more than 1000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is a small change in the average number of daily reported cases (a decrease of 1.2%), while daily reported deaths have decreased 12.2%. The key question remains as to whether transmission is in fact slowing down or whether these figures reflect reporting artifact seen surrounding weekends.

Impression: Basically unchanged from previous discussions -- the SARS-CoV-2 is still actively being transmitted in all regions of the world, and many countries are showing increases in their daily newly confirmed case counts and mortality, while the global 7-day averages seem to reflect a slowing down of reporting confirmed cases; however, I still wonder whether this is real or reflects a changing pattern with decreased testing or case reporting. For example, the USA reported data suggest a slowing down of transmission over the past 2 weeks as seen by the comparative 7-day averages in reported new cases (see section [3E] above). The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. The most severely affected region is the Americas, with increasing daily case counts, even though the comparative 7-day average suggests things may be slowing down (or reporting is slowing down). India also drives the next most affected region -- South East Asia -- with persistent high daily case reports. - Mod.MPP]
