From: Mark Pokras, DVM <mark.pokras@tufts.edu>

I appreciated the exchange on botulism, loons and crayfish. If I may, I'd
like to inject a bit more ecological perspective. We have been doing a
study of mortality factors in common loons (now in it's 11th year, 500+
loons)). One of our findings is that loons debilitated from nearly any
cause (lead toxicosis, fractures, neoplasia, etc.) resort to increased
consumption of invertebrate prey items -- most often crayfish in
fresh-water situations. Data are currently being prepared for
publication.
My simple explanation is these prey species are slower moving, occur in
shallower water, and are easier for debilitated loons to prehend.
