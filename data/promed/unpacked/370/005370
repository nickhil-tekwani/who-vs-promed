Appearance of anthrax in Malatya's Kuluncak district lands one woman
in the hospital under treatment.
The agricultural director of Malatya, Ahmet Guldal, has announced
that anthrax vaccination campaigns will be carried out following the
appearance of anthrax in the region.
According to the information obtained, 6 members of the patient's
family, residents of the Kizilhisar Koyu district, brought her to the
Kuluncak Health office when she became ill. The Malatya State
Hospital representative diagnosed the 54-year-old patient with
anthrax and placed her under treatment.
The patient noticed the appearance of a lesion on her arm after
washing the mouth of a lamb. When the lesion became larger, she went
to the doctor and was told that she had contracted anthrax. The
other 6 people in the family have stated that they will return to the
hospital for monitoring. It is reported that a few others in the
village have similar lesions on their limbs.
Director Guldal, who received this information last Friday, sent a
veterinary team to the area to administer anthrax vaccine. Guldal
reports, "We have learned that 7 of our citizens, after eating [the
meat of] one lamb/sheep and one cow killed in the village, have
become ill and have been sent to Malatya State Hospital."

[If the patient has indeed developed the lesion on her arm after
washing the mouth of a (live) lamb, the likely diagnosis should be
Contagious ecthyma (orf) rather than anthrax. Cutaneous anthrax, in
humans, might be clinically confused with orf. Data on the health
situation of the relevant sheep flock will be helpful; anthrax should
also have caused sudden mortalities in unvaccinated sheep, which will
show the typical PM lesions and may be quickly lab-confirmed. -
