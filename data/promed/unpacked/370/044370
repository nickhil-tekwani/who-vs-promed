[The above OIE notification is an official confirmation of the (subclinical) cases described in ProMED-mail's posting 20190312.6363735, published 12 Mar 2019. For subscribers' convenience, the said posting is hereby copied:

"Two cases of bluetongue, also known as bluetongue disease, have been discovered in a beef cattle operation near Paliseul and confirmed on [Wed morning 6 Mar 2019]. The 1st case was discovered 3 to 4 weeks ago during a winter check on some animals on the farm. This was followed by a 2nd check on the whole herd, which revealed a 2nd [BTV-positive] case. At this stage, the Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain [FASFC] does not want to be alarmist and does not relate to a disease focus but of 2 isolated cases that would not be contagious by contact. No special restriction measures for animal movements have been applied, but the veterinarians of the region received this Wed [6 Mar 2019] morning a letter from the FASFC, requesting all cattle, sheep, and goats holdings within a radius of 5 km [approx. 3mi] around the involved farm to undergo a blood test."

Outbreaks 2, 3, and 4 above, in Paliseul (2) and Bievre (1), have been added to the event discovered earlier near Paliseul. They may have been discovered within the blood test operation undertaken around the initial case, as mentioned in the posting.

BTV-8 has been circulating in France for several years, infections in cattle remaining subclinical. Since late 2018, the virus spread to adjacent German and Swiss territories, affecting cattle in Germany and sheep in Switzerland. This led to the application of animal-movement restrictions and other biosecurity measures in both countries. The Belgian authorities may be obliged to apply similar measures.

The detection of the cases in southern Belgium's Luxembourg province, bordering France, may present a direct spread from France, not related to the German and Swiss events.

The BTV-8 virus may cause congenital lesions in bovine foeti, as recently reported from France.

Subscribers may consider referring to a recent assessment of the BTV-8 event in Germany, published 21 Jan 2019 by UK's DEFRA experts, at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/773015/btv8-germany-update2.pdf. - Mod.AS
