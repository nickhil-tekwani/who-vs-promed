BULGARIA, June 2 - Bulgaria suspended domestic sales and imports of Belgian
chicken products pending tests for the presence of the cancer-causing
chemical dioxin, the National Veterinary Service (NVS) said on Wednesday.
"Our service is taking samples of Belgian chicken products in storage
houses for tests. Until we know the results of the tests we have banned
imports and sales on the local market," head of the NVS Ilian Bachvarov
told reporters. The precautionary measures were taken after the European
Union warned on Tuesday of high levels of the poison dioxin in Belgian
chickens and eggs.
Poultry imports from Belgium are relatively small as Bulgaria is mostly
self-sufficient in chicken and egg production.

SWITZERLAND June 2 -Switzerland has banned with immediate effect the import
of Belgian eggs or egg-products, the Federal Veterinary Office (BVET)
decided on Wednesday.
Heinz Mueller, spokesman for BVET, told reporters the decision was related to
the discovery of dioxin-poisoned chicken meat in Belgium. Chicken meat is
constantly checked at the border by BVET and an import ban is not needed.

FRANCE June 2 - France moved to limit the fallout from the Belgian
chicken scare, ordering the recall of poultry and eggs produced at farms
that may have used feed tainted by the cancer-causing chemical dioxin.
The withdrawal of some poultry from store shelves came as French Farm
Minister Jean Glavany described as a "grave crisis" the latest tainted food
threat to face European consumers.
The government was preparing to pull other foods from store shelves, such
as noodles, mayonnaise and biscuits made with eggs.
Glavany told TF1 television that the European Union had decided to halt
sales of some "derivative" products and was about to issue a list. "We will
then set up a crisis cell to halt those sales," he said. "Even if the risk
is virtually nil, we can't play with consumers' health," he added.
As many as 100 farms may be affected by the recall of eggs and chickens,
one government official told reporters.
"The French government this morning began to withdraw from commercial
outlets all eggs and chickens coming from farms that were possibly
contaminated with dioxin," the official said.
He said that for now, the government was withdrawing poultry originating
from 31 farms in northern France and 50 in the Eure-et-Loire region
southwest of Paris. In recent days, France has moved to quarantine at least
70 poultry farms and has withdrawn animal feed products suspected of having
been contaminated with dioxin.
Another government official said a consumer fraud protection unit of the
Ministry of Finance would verify that the products were being withdrawn. He
said he did not immediately know how many eggs and chickens were affected
by the recall.
Separately, the national feed makers' association SNIA said it had asked
its members to stop importing and using animal fats from the Benelux states
and warned livestock producers to be extremely cautious about such products.
France's decision to pull suspected poultry products came just days after
Belgium banned the sale of chicken and eggs after high levels of dioxin
were found in chicken and eggs linked to a batch of animal feed
contaminated with the chemical.
Glavany, speaking to the National Assembly, recommended consumers buy
chickens with specific quality labels, which he said guaranteed products
were free from the dangers of intensive production. Earlier he had warned
consumers against over-reacting.
"It is important to reassure consumers that they shouldn't avoid an entire
product when an accident is limited to a few farms," he was quoted as
saying in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde.

SPAIN June 2 - Spanish authorities confiscated 1,200 baby chickens from
Belgium after some Belgian chicken products were found to be tainted with
the cancer-causing substance dioxin, a government spokesman said on
Wednesday.
Fernando Martin told reporters, authorities would kill the newly-hatched
chicks which were seized in Alicante in southeastern Spain.
Martin said the government would comply with European Commission rulings on
poisoned animal feed from Belgium.
The Commission, invoking special emergency powers, ordered the tracing and
destruction of chicken and egg-based foodstuffs in the European Union if
they could be sourced to Belgian poultry feed contaminated with dioxin.
The decision affects goods with an egg content over two percent -- which
includes fresh pasta, mayonnaise and cakes -- and products manufactured
between January 15 and June 1.
