The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources recently received confirmation that white nose syndrome, a disease that has killed millions of bats in eastern North American, is now officially in South Carolina.

Until now, South Carolina appeared to be insulated from white nose syndrome [WNS]. However, a dead bat discovered recently at Table Rock State Park in northern Pickens County has been confirmed to have WNS, which spreads mainly through bat-to-bat contact and has not been found to infect humans or other animals. "We have been expecting WNS in South Carolina," said Mary Bunch, wildlife biologist with the SC Department of Natural Resources based in Clemson.

"We have watched the roll call of states and counties and Canadian provinces grow each year since the 1st bat deaths were noted in New York in 2007." Estimates of bat mortality from WNS in North America range from 5.7-6.7 million bats since the new pathogen was first discovered.

Table Rock State Park staff informed Bunch about what appeared to be a dead bat and asked whether it should undergo WNS testing. Bunch was doing routine WNS monitoring in the area and collected the bat, a tri-colored bat. The bat was collected on 21 Feb 2013, transported on ice, and submitted to the Southeastern Cooperative Wildlife Disease Study in Athens, Georgia. The Wildlife Disease Study confirmed the presence of _Geomyces destructans_ fungus, which causes WNS.

Table Rock's bat colony is in a remote portion of the park not accessible to the public, and the discovery of the white nose syndrome bat is not a threat to park visitors' health and safety and will not have any negative effects upon their visits to Table Rock State Park.

With the addition of South Carolina, WNS has now been confirmed in 21 states and 5 Canadian provinces.

Currently there is no cure or effective treatment for WNS, and mortality in some species, such as the small tri-colored bat, has exceeded 98 per cent. Bats have very low reproductive rates so recovery from losses takes a long time. Formerly common bats are becoming rare, and some rare bats may be lost. The fungus grows best in a cool moist environment, the same places bats go to hibernate.

Bat species that hibernate in mines or caves are susceptible to WNS. In South Carolina, those species are big brown bat, little brown bat, Eastern small-footed bat, Northern long-eared bat, tricolored bat, and Southeastern bat.

In the south east, there are some other colonial, non-hibernating, bats in which WNS has not been detected, such as the free-tailed bat and the evening bat.

While WNS is not harmful to humans, scientists believe it is possible for humans to transport fungal spores on clothing and gear. In 2009, the US Fish and Wildlife Service advised cavers and researchers to curtail caving activities and implement decontamination procedures in an effort to reduce the spread of WNS. The fungus cannot be killed simply by washing clothing.

Bats play a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems and have an enormous impact on pest control, benefiting the economies of both forestry and agriculture in the United States. For example, the one million little brown bats that have already died due to WNS would have eaten between 660 and 1320 metric tons of insects in one year. A recent study published in Science estimates that insect-eating bats provide a significant pest-control service, saving the US agricultural industry at least USD 3 billion a year.

"The news that white nose syndrome has been confirmed in South Carolina is devastating for these very important mammals," Bunch said. "We will continue to work closely with our partners to understand the spread of this deadly disease and to help minimize its impacts to affected bat species."

The Georgia Department of Natural Resources said Tuesday [12 Mar 2013] that bats with a deadly disease have been found in 2 Dade County, Georgia, caves.

Several tri-colored bats with white nose syndrome were found in Lookout Mountain Cave at Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, and in Sittons Cave at Cloudland Canyon State Park.

White nose syndrome is named for a white fungus that coats the muzzles, ears, and wings of infected bats, according to Georgia DNR [Department of Natural Resources] wildlife biologist Trina Morris. The disease is deadly to bats and has killed millions of them in the eastern US.

Morris said there is no evidence white nose syndrome infects humans, but people have carried spores of it out of caves on their clothing or gear.

Indeed, it has been a roll call of affected states and provinces, and now we add 2 more states to the list of those affected with WNS.

This is an extremely devastating disease and seems to be simply wiping out the bat population. While some good news is that tiny hints of recovery may be occurring, the bad news is by far overshadowing the tiny hints. To add to the bad news is that science is batting its proverbial head against a brick wall at finding a cure for this disease. While there are things being tried, it certainly seems to be baby steps. - Mod.TG]
