Abstract
The frequency of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated individuals increased with the emergence of the delta variant, particularly with longer time from vaccine completion. However, whether breakthrough infections lead to onward transmission remains unclear. Here, we conducted a study involving 125 patients comprised of 72 vaccinated and 53 unvaccinated individuals, to assess the levels of infectious virus in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Quantitative plaque assays showed no significant differences in the titers of virus between these cohorts. However, the proportion of nasopharyngeal samples with culturable virus was lower in the vaccinated patients relative to unvaccinated patients (21% vs. 40%). Finally, time-to-event analysis with Kaplan-Myer curves revealed that protection from culturable infectious virus waned significantly starting at 5 months after completing a 2-dose regimen of mRNA vaccines. These results have important implications in timing of booster dose to prevent onward transmission from breakthrough cases.

These observations suggest that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may not alter the levels of replicating virus in the upper respiratory tract once viral infection establishes but may instead protect through accelerated clearance or enhanced neutralization of infectious viral particles [6].

These results agree with previous studies that suggest mRNA vaccination protection decreases over time [7, 8], and also further suggests the broad adoption of mRNA boosters in a critical 4-6-month window may reduce transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 among fully vaccinated individuals with breakthrough infections.

Abstract
The rapid spread and high transmissibility of the omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is likely to lead to a significant number of key workers testing positive simultaneously. Under a policy of self-isolation after testing positive, this may lead to extreme staffing shortfalls at the same time as hospital admissions are peaking. Using a model of individual infectiousness and testing with lateral flow tests (LFT), we evaluate test-to-release policies against conventional fixed-duration isolation policies in terms of excess days of infectiousness, days saved, and tests used. We find that the number of infectious days in the community can be reduced to almost zero by requiring at least 2 consecutive days of negative tests, regardless of the number of days' wait until testing again after initially testing positive. On average, a policy of fewer days' wait until initiating testing (e.g., 3 or 5 days) results in more days saved vs. a 10-day isolation period, but also requires a greater number of tests. Due to a lack of specific data on viral load progression, infectivity, and likelihood of testing positive by LFT over the course of an omicron infection, we assume the same parameters as for pre-omicron variants and explore the impact of a possible shorter proliferation phase.

[3] Omicron wave
Date: Tue 4 Jan 2022
Source: Science [abridged, edited]
https://www.science.org/content/article/omicron-cases-are-exploding-scientists-still-don-t-know-how-bad-wave-will-be


Omicron cases are exploding. Scientists still don't know how bad the wave will be
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As this year [2022] begins, the omicron variant is smashing COVID-19 infection records across Europe, North America, Africa, and Australia. With massive numbers of people infected or in quarantine, tens of thousands of flights and trains have been canceled, and work and schools disrupted. Earlier in the pandemic, the frightful, near-vertical rise in cases would have triggered stringent lockdowns. Not this time: Many governments are banking on early indications that vaccines still protect against severe disease and that omicron may be a gentler variant.

It's a risky bet, because scientists still can't predict omicron's ultimate toll. Initial data from South Africa, Denmark, and the United Kingdom suggest it causes less severe disease, but they come with major caveats. And even less severe cases can strain hospitals already at the edge of their capabilities. In a worrying sign, COVID-19 hospitalization rates in the United States surged this week.

Virologists, molecular biologists, and epidemiologists are biting their nails and hoping cases will soon peak and begin to fall. They are also working at top speed to sort out the properties of the new variant. Here are some of the key questions they are trying to answer.

How does omicron differ from previous variants?
----------------------------------------
Just 6 weeks after its discovery, it's clear the new strain behaves very differently from previous ones. Early studies by several groups hinted that omicron replicates less well in lung cells than other variants, and 2 new studies have suggested a possible mechanism, based on how it enters human cells.

SARS-CoV-2 has 2 entry routes. After binding to ACE2, a receptor protein on the cell surface, virus particles can fuse with the cell directly when another human protein called TMPRSS2 cleaves the spike protein on the virus' surface. Alternatively, after binding to ACE2, the virus can be swallowed by the cell in a vesicle called an endosome. The virus then escapes into the cell's cytoplasm with the help of other spike-cleaving proteins called cathepsins.

Early lab studies showed TMPRSS2 cleaves omicron's spike protein less efficiently than that of other variants, hampering the first, direct route. And in a preprint posted last week, virologist Joe Grove of the University of Glasgow and others showed that blocking TMPRSS2 with the chemical camostat inhibited pseudoviruses carrying the spike of the alpha or delta variants in cell culture, but not those carrying omicron's. Conversely, blocking cathepsins with a compound named E64d inhibited viruses carrying omicron's spike, but not alpha's or delta's. Those data make "clear there's a very, very strong preference now for the endosomal route," Grove says. [Brian J. Willett, Joe Grove, Oscar A MacLean, et al. The hyper-transmissible SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant exhibits significant antigenic change, vaccine escape and a switch in cell entry mechanism. MedRxiv 2022.01.03.21268111; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.03.21268111]

(Another new preprint, by virologist Thomas Peacock of Imperial College London and colleagues, had similar findings. [Thomas P. Peacock, Jonathan C. Brown, Jie Zhou, et al. The SARS-CoV-2 variant, omicron, shows rapid replication in human primary nasal epithelial cultures and efficiently uses the endosomal route of entry. bioRxiv 2021.12.31.474653; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.31.474653])

Some researchers argue omicron may spare the lungs and cause milder disease because TMPRSS2 is more common on cells in the lower airways, but there are few data to support that, Peacock says. Cells infected with omicron may also be less likely to fuse with neighboring cells to form large cells called syncytia that might be a cause of severe disease.

"For now, the combined data seem to point in the direction of a less severe clinical picture, possibly explained by changes in how the viruses infect and which cell types they infect," says virologist Marion Koopmans of Erasmus Medical Center.

Could these changes in viral biology explain why omicron is spreading so fast?
----------------------------------------
Perhaps. It's possible they have shortened the time between exposure and onset of symptoms, which studies suggest is only 3 days for omicron, down from about 4 days for delta and more than 5 for previous variants. This is likely contributing to the steep rise in COVID-19 case numbers. But other changes may play a role as well.

One is the variant's ability to get around immunity provided by previous infections and vaccines. A study of SARS-CoV-2 spread in nearly 12 000 households in Denmark, posted as a preprint on 27 Dec 2021, provides some of the clearest evidence of omicron's advantage. Economist Frederik Plesner Lyngse of the University of Copenhagen and the Danish Statens Serum Institute and his colleagues found that in households with a delta outbreak, the unvaccinated were twice as likely to be infected by a household member as those who were fully vaccinated. In households struck by omicron, unvaccinated and fully vaccinated people had roughly equal chances of catching the virus. [Frederik Plesner Lyngse, Laust Hvas Mortensen, et al. SARS-CoV-2 Omicron VOC Transmission in Danish Households. medRxiv preprint; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.12.27.21268278]

That doesn't mean COVID-19 shots don't work; other data clearly show they still prevent severe disease. And in the Danish study, a booster shot cut the risk of infection by omicron in half. Being vaccinated also reduces an infected person's chance of infecting others, Lyngse notes: For both variants, an unvaccinated case was 41% more likely to infect another household member than a fully vaccinated one.

There's another possible explanation for omicron's explosive spread that the household study would not be able to pick up, notes epidemiologist Bill Hanage of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. If the virus is really better at replicating in the upper airways, it might be expelled more readily into the surrounding air, making it more likely to trigger superspreading events. And if it truly causes milder illness, even people who shed a lot of virus might have few symptoms, making them more likely to be out and about. If so, banning large gatherings and closing down nightlife and restaurants might be even more effective at slowing the spread of omicron than that of previous variants, Hanage says.

Is omicron sending fewer people to the hospital than previous variants?
----------------------------------------
Data from South Africa, where cases have already started to decline, suggest omicron put one-third as many people in the hospital as the delta variant did. But previous infections and the country's relatively young population may have helped keep severe cases low.

Initial hospital data from England and Denmark also suggest omicron cases are less severe. But those countries have high vaccination rates, and there, too, omicron has spread most quickly among younger adults. Severe cases may increase in the wake of holiday parties where people of all ages mixed. "If we see that omicron is capable of causing severe disease in older age groups ... I think it could be much worse than most people are thinking about at the moment," Hanage says. The U.S. picture looks less hopeful: More than 100 000 people there were hospitalized with COVID-19 when Science went to press -- up from 75 000 a week earlier.

Moreover, there are signs omicron can trigger dehydration from fever, vomiting, and diarrhea and can exacerbate other health issues such as diabetes. Such cases need less intensive care, but can still overwhelm hospitals. "I'm hearing story after story after story of hospitals that are full, health care workers that are infected, that can't do their job," says Maria van Kerkhove, an epidemiologist at the World Health Organization (WHO).

How severe omicron is in people who are "immunologically naive" -- neither vaccinated nor previously infected -- remains an open question. They are now a minority in most countries, but they too could add to the hospital burden if they get seriously ill. Deaths in Ghana, Ivory Coast, and Madagascar, where vaccination rates are low, are increasing sharply as COVID-19 cases surge.

Is omicron the last variant of concern?
----------------------------------------
Probably not. More variants with omicron's ability to evade immunity and spread successfully are likely to emerge, says Aris Katzourakis, who studies virus evolution at the University of Oxford -- and they may prove more virulent than omicron. After all, even omicron itself may not have evolved to cause less severe disease, Katzourakis notes. It may be milder than alpha or delta, but it branched off from the family tree before those variants emerged. "Is it milder than what it evolved from? I don't think we know the answer to that," Katzourakis says.

The next variant to make global headlines may already be circulating. WHO is tracking 2 "variants of interest" and 3 "variants under monitoring," as well as 30 sublineages of delta, Van Kerkhove says. "There are many more Greek letters that we can potentially go through."

But omicron itself may help tame whatever comes next. Vaccination and natural infections have exposed many millions of people to earlier versions of SARS-CoV's spike protein, training their immune system to respond to those variants. Infections with omicron, whose spike looks different, will likely both strengthen and broaden immunity, Hanage says, hopefully making new variants less dangerous. "I suspect that immunity, post-omicron, will be pretty broad," Hanage says. "But I don't want to bet on it."

European countries report post-holiday COVID surges
----------------------------------------
In the wake of holiday gatherings amid the much more transmissible omicron (B.1.1.529) variant, a number of European nations today [5 Jan 2022] reported new daily record highs, including France, Denmark, and Switzerland.

Hospitalizations rising at a slower pace
----------------------------------------
France yesterday [4 Jan 2022] reported a record 271 686 cases, with the number likely to top 300 000 today [5 Jan 2022]. The country's surge comes as French lawmakers advance a vaccine-pass bill through Parliament in an attempt to avoid more restrictive measures for the whole population and to ease pressure on health systems, according to ABC News. [https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/france-sees-record-271000-coronavirus-cases-single-day-82072130]

The country's hospitalization level has been growing but not at the same pace as overall COVID-19 infections.

Denmark's Statens Serum Institute reported more than 28 000 cases today [5 Jan 2022], a new daily record, and predicted that daily cases could range from 25 000 to 55,000 cases a day toward the end of January [2022]. The group said daily hospitalization levels could range from 150-360 a day, with as many as 25% initially receiving treatment for conditions other than COVID-19.

Switzerland today [5 Jan 2022] reported a record 31 109 cases, reflecting a 66% increase from the 7-day average. Meanwhile, hospitalizations were up 5%, and the intensive care unit (ICU) level showed a small drop. Business leaders in Switzerland are calling for eased quarantine restrictions to prevent staff shortages and disruptions.

Elsewhere, the Netherlands also reported a new daily high today [5 Jan 2022], with 24 590 new cases. Younger people, especially those in their 20s, were the hardest hit group. Amsterdam and Rotterdam are 2 of the main hot spots. However, hospitalizations declined to the lowest level in 8 weeks.

And in Germany, cases are rising again, after falling in December [2021], according to Reuters. Health officials say the omicron variant makes up about 25% of Germany's cases, but they expect it to become dominant in the next few days. [https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/german-minister-wants-avoid-lockdown-infections-jump-2022-01-05/]

More global headlines
• Brazil's COVID-19 cases are rising, with a jump in confirmed omicron cases, according to Reuters. Some cities have cancelled upcoming Carnival parades, including Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, and Belo Horizonte.

• In Asia, Thailand's cases are starting to rise, and officials are considering new measures to slow the spread, and Japan is battling a doubling of infections in Okinawa prefecture, with the activity linked to clusters at US military bases.

• The global total today [5 Jan 2022] climbed to 297 048 673 cases, and 5 463 317 people have died from their infections, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard. [https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/]

[For those who wish to see the detailed global data, a snapshot of the Worldometer table at the time we accessed it is available at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20WORLDDATA%20JAN5_1641498698.pdf.

A 7-day series of cumulative data reported by countries, territories, and reporting entities can be found at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/2022%20JAN5WORLD7_1641498713.pdf.

In the past 24 hours, 29 countries including the USA (764 466), France (332 252), the UK (193 814), Italy (189 088), Spain (137 180), India (97 296), Argentina (95 159), Australia (71 382), Turkey (66 467), Germany (63 191), Belgium (46 426), Greece (43 386), Canada (42 166), Portugal(39 570), Switzerland (31 018), Sweden (17 514), Brazil (27 267), Denmark (26 200), Netherlands (24 490), Mexico (20 626), Ireland (17 656), Poland (17 197), Vietnam (17 017), Russia (15 772), Israel (17 232), Columbia (16 259), South Africa (11 106), Philippines (10 626), and Czech Republic (10 229) reported the highest numbers of cases, all reporting more than 10 000 newly confirmed cases. A global total of 8584 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 3 Jan 2022 to late 4 Jan 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last couple of weeks can be attributed to the rapid increase in the omicron variant cases in over 90 countries. Studies suggest that the omicron variant causes milder disease than the previously dominant delta variant, but the high number of cases caused by this highly infectious/transmissible variant could rapidly overwhelm hospitals and health systems. The 7 day averages indicate an increasing global trend of cases with some reduction in deaths.

A total of 71 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 39 of the 71 countries are from the European region, 8 are from the Americas region, 5 are from the Western Pacific region, 6 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 3 from the South East Asia region, and 10 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have increased by 94.3%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 7.3%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 102.3% increase in daily reported cases and a 14.8% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily reported over 2.5 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 298.26 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.48 million reported deaths. - Mod.UBA]
