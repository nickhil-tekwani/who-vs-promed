With five people already dead in Banke due to encephalitis and the disease
ready to strike in Kailali, the District Encephalitis Control Committee has
started a drive to raise awareness and inoculate the local population
against this debilitating disease. For the past 16-17 years cases of
encephalitis have climbed to alarming level throughout the 20 most badly
affected districts in the Terai, especially in the far west. This year, the
authorities are stepping up their action with only 4 months to go till the
monsoon.
Out of 1040 cases of encephalitis, 107 proved fatal this year. Likewise 30
were sent out for further examination and 37 extracted themselves while
under treatment. Only 166 were completely cured. The control committee
comprising health officials and communities under the guidance of the Red
Cross Society has already amassed Rs 739 260 to combat this annual
epidemic. The authorities have come to a decision to set up a Trust to
oversee the controlling of the disease and have promised to make added
efforts to inoculate the surrounding population. "Every individual needs
Rs.1500 for medicines therefore we need Rs. 2 million to set up the Trust",
said Thana Gautam, the Chief District Officer. Work to raise money for the
Trust will begin from mid April said officials.
Representatives from the local hospitals said that there was only a minimum
possibility of achieving the goal of maximum inoculation. They also pointed
out that the lack of beds in the hospitals and nursing homes and the
general low level of sanitation and lack of awareness made control of the
disease difficult. Last year 25 000 children received inoculations against
the disease.
