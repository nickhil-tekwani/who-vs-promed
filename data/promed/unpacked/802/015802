Kolkata city is in the grip of a viral fever that has affected
thousands, including many in Ballygunge, Alipore and parts of central
Kolkata. It has been leading to high fever accompanied by a severe
lung and chest infection, often causing severe respiratory problems.
Experts have been taken by surprise by the late outbreak of this viral
epidemic, which usually occurs during change of seasons.

The new virus is far more potent and different from the ones that
have struck in previous years, said doctors.

"This one has been attacking the respiratory system, which makes it
more risky. Patients have been suffering from severe breathlessness
along with an intense joint and muscle pain. Many are also falling
prey to secondary bacterial infections. There have been several cases
where malaria has been detected in these patients as well," said
Tomonash Bhattacharya, tropical medicine expert.

Typical symptoms of the viral attack have been a dry cough followed
by high fever and joint pain. From the 3rd day onwards, patients have
had a severe lung congestion with respiratory trouble. The fever has
not been subsiding before a week, leaving victims too frail to resume
normal activities.

"It is the reactive phenomenon that has been causing the joint and
muscle pain. Antibodies triggered to fight the virus are responsible
for this. But it still remains unclear how the respiratory tract is
being affected so severely. We encounter new strains [of what?] every
year, and this one seems to be an alteration of its previous avatars,"
said Debashish Basu, preventive medicine specialist.

Use of antibiotics has been ruled out by doctors. Paracetamols are
being recommended to check the fever along with blood tests. Care
should be taken to make sure that the viral attack does not conceal
viral infections like dengue and chikungunya. Secondary bacterial
infections like pneumonia could also accompany the viral attack,
doctors pointed out. "In many cases, blood tests have also revealed
malaria, which is a worry. This means the disease is back and could be
mistaken for this viral fever," said Bhattacharya.

Even though it is too early for a malaria outbreak, inconsistent rain
over the last one month could have hastened it, some feared. "Scanty
rainfall helps mosquito breeding. This year [2011], we have had
erratic rain followed by a spell of intense heat which has forced many
to reject the mosquito net. This has obviously led to a spurt in
malaria. But it's still not an outbreak," said Bhattacharya. 20-25 per
cent of blood tests have so far been positive in the malaria-prone
pockets of the city like Kolutola, College Street, Taltala, Beniapukur
and parts of Tollygunge. The onset of monsoon could help to curb the
viral outbreak, felt experts.

"A viral outbreak is unusual in peak summer, for the virus dies out
in heat. But this is a heat-resistant variety that has appeared in May
2011. Other than adults, it has been affecting children as well,
especially those aged between 3-5 years. Youngsters are more
vulnerable due to their low resistance. Many are suffering from
dehydration, while some have also had seizures induced by high fever,"
said pediatrician Shantanu Ray. Liberal fluid intake has been
recommended by doctors. "It's also advisable to avoid the mid-day
heat. In case you can't, drink water and wear a cap. Be careful about
the water you drink, and avoid street food like sliced fruits, which
are prone to infection," added Ray.

[No evidence is presented to confirm the virus etiology of these
cases or indicate which virus might be involved in this setting.
Additional information on this outbreak and its cause would be
welcome.

[The above newswire seems to mention definitively "viral fever" as a
diagnosis, yet at the same time mentions that 20-25 percent of blood
tests done in known "malaria-prone pockets" of the city are positive
for malaria parasites.

According to the GIDEON database (http://www.gideononline.com),
leading diagnostic contenders for febrile illness with arthralgias and
pneumonia include: _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, influenza, enterovirus and
adenovirus infections. While _mycoplasma pneumoniae_ does occur in
outbreaks, the outbreaks tend to be in closed populations such as
schools (as reminded by Mod.ML). The human metapneumovirus might also
be a possible etiology (also suggested by Mod.ML), having been 1st
identified in the Netherlands in 2000/2001. It has been shown to be a
major cause of lower respiratory infection in children, and the above
newswire mentions that children aged 3-5 years have been affected by
this outbreak as well as adults. While influenza is also a leading
cause of febrile respiratory illness with pneumonia, the absence of
reported increases in mortality associated with the above mentioned
epidemic would be unusual. Hence, this moderator has difficulty
finding a definitive diagnosis that would explain the outbreak as
described in the newswire.

This moderator wonders whether the above newswire might well be
describing a mix of concurrent outbreaks in the city, one related to
the increase in malaria, one related to a respiratory virus, and
perhaps concurrent chikungunya, explaining those cases with severe
arthralgias as a predominant symptom. Or as Mod.DK suggests, we might
well be seeing a new disease here.

More information from knowledgeable sources in the region would be
greatly appreciated. - Mod.MPP]
