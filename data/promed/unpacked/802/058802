Chilean Congress members have asked the Ministry of Public Health to
declare a "sanitary emergency in the south of the country" related to
seafood poisoning due to _Vibrio parahaemolyticus_.

Deputy Juan Lobos, president of the Health Committee, said that "228
cases so far in a few days more than justifies declaring a sanitary
emergency and must not be seen as alarmist but rather an opportunity
for health authorities to have the right tools to address the issue
from its roots." Lobos said he supported all actions taken by Health
minister Alvaro Erazo, including the decision to advance the
prevention campaign so that people take the necessary precautions.

"We're not asking people not to consume seafood or shellfish but
rather to do it in a responsible way," he stressed. Chilean
authorities have warned about the consumption of raw seafood, mainly
in the southern regions of Maule and Biobio, where the outbreak is
most intense.

Outbreaks of _V. parahaemolyticus_ tend to be concentrated along
coastal regions during the summer and early fall when higher water
temperatures favor higher levels of the bacteria. Seafood most often
implicated includes squid, mackerel, tuna, sardines, crab, shrimp,
and bivalves like oysters and clams.

[Infections with this organism, which can be normal microflora in
seawater, have been associated with the consumption of raw,
improperly cooked, or cooked and re-contaminated fish and shellfish.
A correlation exists between the probability of infection and warmer
months of the year. Improper refrigeration of seafoods contaminated
with this organism will allow its proliferation, which increases the
possibility of infection.

ProMED-mail covered the large 2005 outbreak in Chile. It was quite
impressive in its size (more than 10 000 cases), continued spread
despite early recognition, and the involvement of clams and mussels
rather than the classical oyster vehicle.

Maule and Biobio are 2 of the 15 regions of Chile and are located in
the central part of the country. They can be found on a map at:
