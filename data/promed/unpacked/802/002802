[It is now 19 days since the last report of a locally transmitted case in Wuhan -- 4 days more than 1 incubation period (an outbreak is usually declared over/transmission declared interrupted after 2 incubation periods without newly confirmed cases). In today's (22 Apr 2020) report, there are 4 new reports of locally transmitted infection, 3 in Heilongjiang, and 1 in Guangdong. It has now been 28 days since restrictions were lifted in Guangdong and Heilongjiang, and it appears as though local transmission has been established in both Heilongjiang and Guangdong over the past 18 days or so, albeit the number of reported cases from Guangdong is decreasing and no newly confirmed cases were reported today (22 Apr 2020).

According to the report above, a total of 82 798 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4632 deaths, representing an increase of 10 cases mentioned above, in the 24 hours since yesterday's (21 Apr 2020) report, and there were no newly reported deaths.

As reported, on 24 Mar 2020, China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. There is much caution and skepticism in the media over the reality of the zero case reports. The world is watching carefully to see whether this is safe timing. There do appear to be chains of transmission ongoing in Guangdong and Heilongjiang that are of concern, but clearly the most concerning are the imported cases returning to China.

- KCDC recommended that any facility that makes it easy for people to come in close contact with other people in an enclosed space should refrain from operating as much as possible. Such facilities that have to remain in operation should comply with infection prevention/control guidelines including checking for fever or respiratory symptoms and keeping a log of all users, requiring everyone to wear facemasks and keep distance from each other, and disinfecting and ventilating the space.
- KCDC stressed that reducing contact with other people as much as possible and maintaining personal hygiene are highly important to preventing COVID-19.
- People who cannot avoid visiting an enclosed/crowded place should keep at least 2 meters of distance from others, wear a facemask, and maintain hand hygiene by washing hands or using hand sanitizers.
- KCDC also stressed that people who have suspected COVID-19 symptoms should not go to work or leave home and should go to a screening center to be tested.
- KCDC participated in the "Relay Support and Encouragement for Healthcare Workers" campaign called #Thanks To You Challenge proposed by the Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters at KCDC Emergency Operation Center, expressing gratitude to healthcare workers and citizens for their contribution to Korea's COVID-19 response.
- KCDC Director Dr. Jung Eun-Kyeong and KCDC staff practiced the sign language for "Respect" to remember the sacrificial dedication of healthcare workers in the frontlines who are fighting COVID-19 day and night for 3 months at the forefront.

[The above are the latest breakdowns of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the USA, as per Worldometer data. The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is now 828 994 including 47 676 deaths, an increase from 819 164 cases and 45 340 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 262 268 (31.6%) cumulative case reports and 5713 (19.2%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing.

Daily reported case counts are high in New Jersey (3478 -- 11.6% of total), California (1811 - 6.1%), Massachusetts (1745 -- 5.8%) and Illinois (2049 - 6.8%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, and Texas.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) has 2 epidemic curves. One focuses on date of confirmation of disease, the other on date of onset of illness.

[Spain is 2nd globally in terms of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. There were 4211 newly confirmed cases reported today (22 Apr 2020) and 3968 cases reported yesterday (21 Apr 2020). There appears to be a gradual decrease in daily cases starting to show down from the plateau levels of 4000-5000 cases newly confirmed each day.

As of today (22 Apr 2020), totals of 208 389 cases and 21 717 deaths have been reported, up from 204 178 cases and 21 282 deaths in the preceding 24 hours (21 Apr 2020). The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population is now 131.2, a continual slow decrease over the past 14 days from a high of 214.43 on 7 Apr 2020 to 131.2 today (22 Apr 2020). Spain has the highest case count in Europe and is 2nd globally behind the USA in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. There is also a clear growth curve showing the trajectory of the epidemic at https://covid19.isciii.es/; it is updated daily.

Of the 208 389 cases, approximately 77 609 (37.2% have been hospitalized and 7700 (3.6% -- similar decrease observation) admitted to the ICU (there is a note mentioning that some of the communities are providing daily prevalence data, hence my use of "approximately" for hospitalization and ICU data).

A map of Spain showing provinces (autonomous communities) can be seen at https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/map/spain-administrative-map.htm and a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=7259814,43. La Rioja, Navarre, and Basque Country, the most affected communities by population-based rates, are located together in the north of the country. Madrid is in the northern part of central Spain, and Castile-La Mancha is just to the south of Madrid, with Toledo as its capital. - Mod.UBA]
