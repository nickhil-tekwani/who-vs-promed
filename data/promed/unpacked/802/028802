A 3-year-old girl has died of hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) after she contracted it from a nursery in a tambon in Tak's Ban Tak district.

WP, 42, said her daughter died on Sun [3 Sep 2017], 2 days after she was admitted to Somdejphrajaotaksin Maharaj Hospital. She was transferred there from a district hospital after her condition did not improve. She died of heart failure. WP said her daughter went to the nursery of the Tambon Thongfah Administrative Organisation for the 1st time this year [2017]. She said the nursery was closed for a week following the spread of HFMD there.

But after the nursery was reopened just for one day, kids contracted the disease, so the nursery was closed for another week, she said. She said her daughter fell ill with a severe headache, stomach pains, and vomiting after the nursery was closed for the 2nd time.

[This report describes only briefly the symptoms experienced by the child before succumbing to heart failure.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is caused by viruses that belong to the _Enterovirus_ genus (group), including polioviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.

Coxsackievirus A16 is the most common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease, but other coxsackieviruses can also cause the illness. Enterovirus 71 (EV71) has also been associated with cases and outbreaks of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Less often, EV71 has been associated with severe disease, such as encephalitis. Several types of enteroviruses may be identified in outbreaks of hand, foot and mouth disease; however, most of the time, one or 2 enteroviruses are identified.

Since the initial description of EV71 in 1974 [1], outbreaks of infection with this virus have occurred periodically throughout the world [2-8]. EV71 infection manifests most frequently as the childhood exanthem known as "hand, foot, and mouth disease" (HFMD), and it is clinically indistinguishable from HFMD caused by Coxsackie virus A16 (CA16). A molecular study of the evolution of human enteroviruses has shown that EV71 and CA16 have a close genetic relationship, and, together with CA7 and CA14, they form a distinct genetic subgroup within cluster A of the _Enterovirus_ genus of the family Picornaviridae [9]. Despite the close genetic relationship between EV71 and CA16, EV71 has a propensity to cause neurological disease during acute infection [2, 3], a feature not observed in CA16 infections. Children under 4 years of age are particularly susceptible to the most severe forms of EV71-associated neurological disease, including meningitis, brain-stem and/or cerebellar encephalitis, and poliomyelitis-like paralysis. The neurological complications of EV71 infection may occasionally cause permanent paralysis or death. Several large epidemics of severe EV71 infection in young children, including numerous cases of fatal brain-stem encephalitis, have recently been reported in Southeast Asia [10-12; excerpted and edited from Peter McMinn et al. Neurological Manifestations of Enterovirus 71 Infection in Children during an Outbreak of Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease in Western Australia.
