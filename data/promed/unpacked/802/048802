There are fresh concerns more horses may be infected with Hendra
virus on a stud at Cawarral in central Queensland.

The manager of the stud, which was quarantined after an outbreak of
Hendra virus, says 25 horses have tested negative. But she is worried
about 3 animals, including one with a nasal discharge and a high temperature.

The disease has already killed 2 horses on the property near
Rockhampton. Biosecurity Queensland says it is monitoring the animals.

[In the prior ProMED-mail posting, Hendra virus, equine - Australia:
(QL) 20090811.2862, there was a report of one confirmed case of
hendravirus infection in a horse in the Cawarral area, and additional
reports of 3 as yet undiagnosed deaths in horses in the same
area. The above report suggests there may be additional horses
involved. Information on results of the investigations surrounding
these suspected cases would be greatly appreciated.
