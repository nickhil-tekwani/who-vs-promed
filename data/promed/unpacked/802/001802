[According to the report above, a total of 82 967 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, including 4634 deaths, representing an increase of 2 cases in the 24 hours since yesterday's (19 May 2020) report. The newly reported cases include 2 new cases of confirmed infections: 1 imported case in Guangdong province and 1 indigenous case in Shanghai municipality. In Hong Kong, where numbers of newly confirmed cases had been reported daily, there were no newly confirmed cases reported in the past 24 hours. Macau has reported no newly confirmed cases. There have been a total of 1709 imported cases reported.

There were 31 newly confirmed infections in asymptomatic people in the past 24 hours, and 3 were imported. There were no cases of conversion from asymptomatic to symptomatic in the past 24 hours. The total number of asymptomatic individuals currently under observation (and isolation) is 375, and 29 of these are importations from abroad. I realize mentioning this on a daily basis is repetitious, but it would be helpful to know what proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals went on to be symptomatic in order to start developing projections of actual infection rates and adjust reported case fatality ratios accordingly. It is apparent that there is most likely thorough contact tracing and testing to explain the daily reports of asymptomatic infections in addition to the screening of individuals arriving from overseas.

As a reminder, it was reported on 24 Mar 2020 that China ended the lockdown in Hubei and elsewhere, and ended it in Wuhan on 7 Apr 2020. In the past few weeks, there have been locally transmitted clusters reported in Guangdong, Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Wuhan. The world is watching carefully to see whether this was safe timing to lift the lockdown.

Regular Briefing of Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters on COVID-19
- The outbreak status of and action plans for Itaewon club-related patients, and the status of school infection prevention and control efforts in preparation for in-person classes, etc.
- The Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters held a meeting today presided over by Head Chung Sekyun (Prime Minister) along with the central government and 17 cities and provinces to discuss agendas including the outbreak status of and action plans for Itaewon club-related patients, and the status of school infection prevention and control efforts in preparation for in-person classes at the Central Disaster and Safety Management Center of the Government Complex Seoul.
- Head Chung received, at this meeting, a report regarding cluster infections from clubs in Itaewon that about half of the visitors listed in the club's entry logs could not be reached, and ordered relevant agencies to devise measures to hold those who give false information in the entry logs accountable if the logs for multi-use facilities are falsely filled in, and to enhance the accuracy of the logs.
- He also stressed that situations such as the Itaewon club cluster infection damage many people, including self-employed and small business owners, and the government should cautiously deal with them to minimize the secondary and tertiary spread of the virus and ease public concerns.

1. Outbreak status of and action plans for Itaewon club-related patients

-The Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters discussed the outbreak status of and preventive action plans for Itaewon club-related patients, with the local governments such as Seoul, Incheon, and Gyeonggi-do as the center.
- After the 1st confirmed patient who visited Itaewon clubs occurred on [6 May 2020], the Seoul Metropolitan Government completed infection control measures at 7 facilities that the confirmed patient visited.
- Seoul is also checking the visitors after securing the entry logs and CCTV from [24 Apr to 6 May 2020] for 5 clubs located in Itaewon. As of 18:00 on [10 May 2020], 2405 out of 5517 club visitors were contacted over the phone, and 3112 have not yet been answering.
- The Seoul Metropolitan Government has expanded diagnostic tests to all visitors to clubs and other nearby establishments in Itaewon, who visited there from [24 Apr to 6 May 2020], and has been conducting active surveillance even if they test negative. In particular, visitors to 3 clubs (King Club, Queen, and Trunk) from 22:00 on [1 May 2020] to 4:00 on [2 May 2020] are required to be in self-quarantine.
- Since [7 May 2020], the Seoul Government has dispatched an immediate response team, operated situation management rooms for each district, including Yongsan-gu, Yeongdeungpo-gu, Seodaemun-gu, and Jongno-gu, and sent out emergency alert text messages twice to guide the visitors to refrain from going out and take diagnostic tests.
- In the future, the government plans to identify the confirmed patients' travel routes and the contacts through in-depth epidemiological investigation and continues to strengthen monitoring of those who are placed under self-quarantine.
- Meanwhile, the Seoul Metropolitan Government issued an administrative order of prohibition of gathering on 2060 entertainment facilities in the city from [9 May 2020] until a separate order is issued, and the Seoul Metropolitan Government, autonomous districts, and the national Police Agency will jointly mobilize 301 people to check whether they stick to prohibition of gathering.
- Seoul announced that it would take strong measures such as accusation if those facilities fail to carry out the administrative order of prohibition of gathering. If a confirmed patient occurs while they run businesses in violation of the order, the government will claim the right to indemnity including medical expenses.
- Incheon has been requesting people who visited 6 clubs (King Club, Queen, Trunk, The Fountain, Soho, and H.I.M.) in Itaewon since [29 Apr 2020] to take diagnostic tests and prohibit interpersonal contact.
- In addition, an administrative order of prohibition of gathering was imposed for 2 weeks from 20:00 on [10 May 2020] on the nightlife establishments (clubs, hostess bar, singing clubs, stand-up bars, cabarets) and collatechs. If they violate the order, imprisonment of up to 2 years or a fine of up to KRW 20 million [USD 16 216] will be imposed, and expenses for infection control will be claimed in case the virus spreads.
- Incheon also conducts diagnostic tests on new patients and new employees at nursing hospitals and mental health institutions for the 1st time in the country, and allows hospitalization and service only if they test negative.
- Gyeonggi-do conducts diagnostic tests for free on residents of the province, who visited any of the 6 Itaewon clubs (King Club, Queen, Trunk, The Fountain, Soho, and H.I.M.), and has ordered prohibition of interpersonal contact starting from [10 May 2020]. The province also guided the visitors to receive medical examination at screening stations and get epidemiological investigations.
- It has been also conducting diagnostic tests and self-quarantine for colleagues at Seongnam City Medical Center and Tmax where confirmed patients were identified.
- Starting from [10 May 2020], Gyeonggi-do issued an administrative order of prohibition of gathering for 2 weeks on 5730 entertainment facilities including all entertainment bars and collatechs and ordered those establishments to attach the letter of administrative order and notices on the establishments. If they violate the order, the province plans to impose a fine and claim damages if any patient is confirmed in those facilities.
- Meanwhile, 215 people in 35 groups were organized jointly with Gyeonggi-do, cities, counties and police stations within the jurisdiction to conduct intensive inspections of entertainment facilities in the province from 20:00 on [8 May to 7 Jun 2020].
- The Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters requested those who visited Itaewon area from [29 Apr to 6 May 2020] to actively cooperate for the measures initiated by the quarantine authorities, such as minimizing contact with others, staying at home, reporting to health centers or 1339, and receiving tests at screening stations.
- It also announced that in the process, personal information of individuals will be strictly protected and respected.

2. Status of school infection prevention and control efforts in preparation for in-person classes

- The Ministry of Education revised and distributed the "Guideline of infection prevention at kindergartens, primary and secondary schools" on [7 May 2020] as social distancing was shifted to distancing in daily life. This guideline contains information related to prevention and control efforts at schools, such as preventing the inflow of suspected COVID-19 cases with symptoms, managing students during educational activities at schools, and establishing a response system if a case is confirmed.
- In order to block the novel coronavirus infection at schools, a daily inspection system plans to be operated to check whether s/he has a suspicious symptom in the form of questionnaire every morning at home from one week before returning to school, and to report information to schools such as the likelihood of infections, including the overseas travel history of students and cohabitants for the last 14 days. It's been applied since [7 May 2020] for high school seniors who will be back in classrooms starting from [13 May 2020].
- After students returning to schools for in-person classes, fever tests will be conducted at least twice a day before entering to a classroom and during the day, and fever and respiratory symptoms will be checked frequently before the start of each class. If there is any suspected symptom, those who show the symptoms will be guided to receive medical examinations and diagnostic tests at the screening stations immediately.
- During educational activities, desks and items must be rearranged to maintain sufficient personal distance, and tools needed for daily disinfection should be often provided.
- In case a suspected case is found among students and faculty members, s/he is guided to immediately take medical examinations and diagnostic tests at the screening stations. In case a confirmed case is identified, all students and staff will return home and the system will be switched to the distance learning system.
- Confirmed cases are suspended from going to school until released from isolation. Suspected cases, patients under investigation, and students in self-quarantine are suspended from going to school for 14 days, and in such cases, s/he will be deemed to attend school even though they are absent.
- The authorities said they will supplement infection prevention and control measures until in-person classes start and continue to inspect prevention and control efforts in schools and provide necessary support.

3. Diagnostic tests to be expanded to nursing and mental hospitals

- The Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters said that COVID-19 diagnostic tests will be expanded to nursing hospitals and mental hospitals as it is necessary to strengthen monitoring of major vulnerable groups and facilities in communities.
- Since [7 Feb 2020], the government has provided full support for the cost of COVID-19 diagnostic tests with the health insurance and government budgets for confirmed cases, suspected cases, and patients under investigation under the case definition of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
- In addition, the government has decided to expand health insurance coverage in consideration of expert opinions that it is necessary to conduct tests on patients without COVID-19 symptoms who are newly admitted to nursing hospitals and mental hospitals.
- Previously, if there were no symptoms related to COVID-19, individuals had to pay the full costs of the test, but this measure allows them to receive 50% of the cost support from health insurance for one test when s/he is hospitalized at a nursing hospital or a mental hospital.
- (Before the new measure) individuals pay full costs of KRW 80 000-160 000 [USD 65-130]; (after the new measure) individuals pay partial costs of about KRW 40 000 [USD 32] (50%).
- This will be applied from [13 May 2020] and will continue until a separate notice comes, and the government will review whether to apply additional health insurance coverage to inpatients at medical institutions while closely looking at the trend of COVID-19 pandemic.
- On average, 1694 people are hospitalized per day in nursing hospitals (as of 2019), and about 2000 patients are expected to be tested per day through this measure.
- The Central Disaster and Safety Countermeasure Headquarters said that it expects the effect of blocking the inflow of hospital infections and preventing the spread of COVID-19 while strengthening the inspections and monitoring of COVID-19 among senior citizens in communities through the expansion of diagnostic tests to nursing hospitals and mental hospital.

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 12 cases with 1 death compared with yesterday's 24-hour period (18-19 May 2020), when there were 32 newly confirmed cases and no deaths. A total of 11 122 confirmed cases and 264 deaths were reported today (20 May 2020), up from 11 110 cases and 263 deaths yesterday (19 May 2020). The daily newly confirmed case count has been at or below 100 for 48 consecutive days and below 50 for 41 consecutive days. For several days, the count was below 10 but started climbing over the last 13 days. In today's (20 May 2020) breakdown of cases, 10 of the cases were locally transmitted, and 2 were imported cases. Locally acquired cases were in Seoul (3), Incheon (6), and Chungnam (1). Imported cases were in Seoul (1) and 1 in quarantine.

As they move to the next phase -- "distancing in daily life" -- all eyes will be on the country to see whether they can maintain the level of control they have had. Importations continue to be the main problem, but the Itaewon nightclub cluster and now possibly a 2nd club district are major concerns at this time. With these outbreaks associated with club districts in Seoul, there may be a rethinking of the next steps. All individuals with a history of club attendance or other crowded locations are now being encouraged to get tested, even if asymptomatic, recognizing the potential role of asymptomatically infected individuals in transmission of the virus.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 227 364 cases, including 32 330 deaths, up from 226 699 cases and 32 169 deaths reported on 19 May 2020. The 24-hour change between 19 and 20 May 2020 was 665 newly confirmed cases, compared with 813 newly confirmed cases between 18 and 19 May 2020, a decrease of 148 from yesterday's (19 May 2020) change. The numbers of hospitalized cases and cases in the ICU are also experiencing a decline.

Cases still continue to be concentrated in the northern part of the country, in Lombardy, the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, and Piedmont. These 4 provinces combined account for 81.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy is the main contributor, representing 44.2 % of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. Lombardy and Piedmont are the only provinces reporting more than 100 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. 13 provinces reported less than 10 newly confirmed cases (5 provinces reported no new cases), and another 6 provinces reported fewer than 50 newly confirmed cases, all signs of decreasing local transmission. Emilia-Romagna is the only province reporting 50 or more cases (but less than 100).

[4] Iran: 126 949 total cases, 7183 deaths
Date: Wed 20 May 2020
Source: 24 Digital [edited]
https://www.24newshd.tv/20-May-2020/iran-says-curbing-virus-even-with-over-2-000-new-cases


Iran on [Wed 20 May 2020] said it was close to "curbing" the new coronavirus outbreak even as it reported more than 2000 fresh infections for the 3rd day in a row.

"We have been progressing at every step in the past 3 months...in fighting this dangerous virus and are nearly on the verge of curbing this disease," said President Hassan Rouhani.

Iran would "even not have these problems" if health protocols "were more closely observed in some of the provinces that are currently in an unfavourable situation," he told a televised cabinet meeting. At least 24 of Iran's 434 counties were "red" -- the highest level on the country's colour-coded risk scale -- according to deputy health minister Alireza Raisi.

He said at a virus taskforce meeting broadcast on [Tue 19 May 2020] that 218 counties were still deemed low risk, which could drop to 183 since the virus had "started peaking" in some regions. He added that most of the fatalities since Iran reported its 1st 2 deaths in February [2020] were above 70 years old, and that younger Iranians were in less danger.

Health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said 2346 new infections were confirmed across the country in the past 24 hours, raising the total to 126 949. More than 98 800 of those hospitalised had recovered and were discharged, while 2673 were in critical condition. He also raised the death toll to 7183 with 64 fatalities in the past day.

According to Jahanpour, there were no deaths over the same period in nearly 1/3 of Iran's provinces, while 8 others only had one. Khuzestan province was still the worst-hit, and the rest of the country was in "relative stability," he added.

Iran's virus cases have been on a rising trajectory since [2 May 2020], when it reported its lowest new infections since [10 Mar 2020]. A taskforce official said [Sun 17 May 2020] that the rise was due to a surge in testing as Iran started "looking at those infected and not hospitalised."

"It is possible that the reported number of infections have gone up, but this in no way means more have been infected with COVID-19," said Ali Akbar Haghdoost. Experts both at home and abroad have voiced skepticism about Iran's official figures, saying the real toll could be much higher.

[In the 24 hours from 19-20 May 2020, the total number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 124 603 to 126 949 total cases [worldometer data 20 May 20:00 GMT], an increase of compared with 2111 newly confirmed cases reported yesterday (19 May 2020). The number of deaths has increased from 7199 to 7183, an adjustment of 16 deaths in the 24-hour period. In terms of total numbers of confirmed cases, Iran ranks 10th globally, behind the USA, Russia, Spain, Brazil, the UK, Italy, France, Germany, and Turkey (Worldometer data as of 20 May 2020; 20:20 GMT).

As with other countries that are lifting business closures, all eyes are on Iran now that "low-risk" businesses are opening, and, unfortunately, it appears as though the opening may have been premature as daily newly confirmed case counts are increasing. The caution is that there is usually a 2-3-week lag between increasing cases and increases in reported deaths, so it may be too early to conclude there aren't increases in deaths. Other countries that are rushing to reopen their economies might look at Iran to learn from its experience.

The total number of confirmed cases in the USA and territories is 1 591 991 now, including 94 994 deaths, an increase from 1 570 583 cases and 93 533 deaths in the past 24 hours. New York state, with 363 517 (22.8%) cumulative case reports and 887 (4.1%) newly confirmed cases over the past 24 hours, is still clearly the epicenter of the outbreak in the USA, although case reporting elsewhere is increasing.

Daily reported case counts are high in Illinois (2388, 11.2%), California (2081, 9.7%), New Jersey (1082, 5.0%), Massachusetts (1045, 4.9%), Texas (979, 4.6%), Georgia (946, 4.4%), New York (887, 4.1%), and Maryland (777, 3.6%). In terms of cumulative case reports, New York is number one, followed by New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas, Florida, and Maryland.

The US military has confirmed 8764 cumulative cases, with 67 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. The Veteran Affairs reported 12 720 cumulative cases and 244 new cases today (20 May 2020). There have been 3629 cases reported from federal prisons (no new cases in the past 24 hours) and 4253 cases reported from the Navajo Nation (182 newly reported cases in the past 24 hours).

[As per the WHO Situation Report 98 from 27 Apr 2020 (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200427-sitrep-98-covid-19.pdf and in COVID-19 update (136): UK NHS increased testing, Brazil, WHO 20200428.7274496), Spain has been reporting only PCR-positive confirmations, and not antibody-based tests, to WHO, since 25 Apr 2020. The number of cumulative antibody-confirmed cases is available just above Figure 3, and I am adding it to the PCR cases. There were 416 newly confirmed cases by PCR in the past 24 hours compared with 295 in the preceding 24-hour period [from 17-18 May 2020], bringing the PCR- [plus number confirmed including all tests] confirmed cumulative total to 232 555 [279 524] cases as compared with 232 037 [278 813] confirmed cases on 19 May 2020. Daily death reports are decreasing as well, with 27 888 deaths reported today (20 May 2020) and 27 778 deaths reported on 19 May 2020, an increase of 110 deaths in 24 hours.

The countrywide 2-week incidence per 100 000 population continues to decrease and is now 17.49, a continual slow decrease over the past 26 days from a high of 214.4 on 7 Apr 2020 to 17.49 today (19 May 2020). Spain has the 2nd-highest case count in Europe (Russia and Brazil have now surpassed Spain according to Worldometer at 20:20 GMT) and is 4th globally behind the USA, Russia, and Brazil in terms of absolute numbers of cases. Figure 1 at the source URL above shows the daily confirmations juxtaposed with dates of onset of disease, and one clearly sees the trend for decreasing confirmations in recent times. According to Table 2, of the 232 555 [279 524] cases, an additional 193 cases have been hospitalized (PCR positive), and an additional 31 cases were admitted to ICU (PCR positive). Overall, 16.0% of hospitalized patients have been admitted to ICU.
