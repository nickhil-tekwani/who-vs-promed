According to information provided by the CSP Emergency in Comrat, a 48-year-old man, a resident of Avdarma, was admitted to the infectious disease ward of the PMSI district hospital on 28 Aug 2015.

The patient fell ill on 26 Aug 2015 with signs of weakness, a temperature of 38.5 C [101 F]; his left hand was swollen with a "carbuncle" anthrax lesion on it dorsal surface. The patient was admitted to hospital with a status of "medium gravity." The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by PCR.

Epidemiologic investigation found that the patient, along with 2 relatives, slaughtered and butchered a [presumably sick] lamb belonging to their family without informing the veterinary authorities of the condition of this lamb. Two shared parts of the carcass had not been consumed, but the 3rd part had been eaten. The health status of those exposed as of 1 Sep 2015 is "satisfactory."

The various government services are mobilized to provide disease control and livestock vaccination. The National Center for Public Health is monitoring the situation.

[Thanks to Sabine for notifying us of this case.

Comrat, a city in the district of Gagauzia, is on the southeast border with Ukraine and appears to be a fragmented rayon, which will impact its administrative efficiency; see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comrat.

This human case follows the events we have seen in previous years in Moldova of villagers slaughtering and butchering sick livestock. Fortunately, in this instance, only one person developed lesions. - Mod.MHJ
