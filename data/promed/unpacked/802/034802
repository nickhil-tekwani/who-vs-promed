A 30-year-old male resident of Dhading district was admitted (on 24 Aug 2016 and discharged on 30 Aug 2016) to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital with a 7-day history of fever with chills, headache, abdominal pain, cough (dry), nausea and hearing impairment. No eschar and/or rash was seen. Dengue, chikungunya, brucellosis and leptospirosis were tested negative. But he tested positive for scrub typhus using ELISA method. He has been complaining of hearing problem during his OPD follow up (on 8 Sep [2016]).

To my knowledge, this is the 1st reported case of hearing impairment associated with scrub typhus in Nepal. Hearing impairment is considered as a rare complication following infection with scrub typhus, though few cases have been reported in the literature.
