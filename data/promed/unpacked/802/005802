In July 2020, the Florida Department of Health was alerted to 3 _C. auris_ bloodstream infections and one urinary tract infection in 4 patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who received care in the same dedicated COVID-19 unit of an acute care hospital (hospital A).

_C. auris_ is a multidrug-resistant yeast that can cause invasive infection. Its ability to colonize patients asymptomatically and persist on surfaces has contributed to previous _C. auris_ outbreaks in healthcare settings (1-7 [see source URL for complete references]). Since the 1st _C. auris_ case was identified in Florida in 2017, aggressive measures have been implemented to limit spread, including contact tracing and screening upon detection of a new case. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, hospital A conducted admission screening for _C. auris_ and admitted colonized patients to a separate dedicated ward.

Hospital A's COVID-19 unit spanned 5 wings on 4 floors, with 12-20 private, intensive care-capable rooms per wing. Only patients with positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, at the time of admission were admitted to this unit. After patient discharge, room turnover procedures included thorough cleaning of all surfaces and floor and ultraviolet disinfection. In response to the 4 clinical _C. auris_ infections, unit-wide point prevalence surveys to identify additional hospitalized patients colonized with _C. auris_ were conducted during 4-18 Aug 2020; patients on all 4 floors were screened sequentially and rescreened only if their initial result was indeterminate. Hospital A's infection prevention team, the Florida Department of Health, and CDC performed a joint investigation focused on infection prevention and control at hospital A that included observation of healthcare personnel (HCP) use of personal protective equipment (PPE), contact with and disinfection of shared medical equipment, hand hygiene, and supply storage. This activity was reviewed by CDC and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy (45 C.F.R. part 46.102(l)(2), 21 C.F.R. part 56; 42 U.S.C. Sect. 241(d); 5 U.S.C. Sect. 552a; 44 U.S.C. Sect. 3501 et seq.).

Among 67 patients admitted to the COVID-19 unit and screened during point prevalence surveys, 35 (52%) received positive test results. Mean age of colonized patients was 69 years (range = 38-101 years) and 60% were male. Six (17%) colonized patients later had clinical cultures that grew _C. auris_. Among patients screened who had available medical records (20), 2 (10%) were admitted directly from a long-term care facility and 8 (40%) died within 30 days of screening, but whether _C. auris_ contributed to death is unknown (Table [see source URL]).

HCP in the COVID-19 unit were observed wearing multiple layers of gowns and gloves during care of COVID-19 patients. HCP donned eye protection, an N95 respirator, a cloth isolation gown, gloves, a bouffant cap, and shoe covers on entry to the COVID-19 unit; these were worn during the entire shift. A 2nd, disposable isolation gown and pair of gloves were donned before entering individual patient rooms, then doffed and discarded upon exit. Alcohol-based hand sanitizer was used on gloved hands after doffing outer gloves. HCP removed all PPE and performed hand hygiene before exiting the unit.

Investigators observed multiple opportunities for contamination of the base layer of gown and gloves during doffing and through direct contact with the patient care environment or potentially contaminated surfaces such as mobile computers. Mobile computers and medical equipment were not always disinfected between uses, medical supplies (e.g., oxygen tubing and gauze) were stored in open bins in hallways and accessed by HCP wearing the base PPE layer, and missed opportunities for performing hand hygiene were observed.

A combination of factors that included HCP using multiple gown and glove layers in the COVID-19 unit, extended use of the underlayer of PPE, lapses in cleaning and disinfection of shared medical equipment, and lapses in adherence to hand hygiene likely contributed to widespread _C. auris_ transmission. After hospital A removed supplies from hallways, enhanced cleaning and disinfection practices, and ceased base PPE layer practices, no further _C. auris_ transmission was detected on subsequent surveys.

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted facilities to implement PPE conservation strategies during anticipated or existing shortages and to use PPE in ways that are not routine (e.g., extended wear and reuse) (8). Some healthcare facilities not experiencing shortages allow extra PPE layers because of the perception of increased protection for HCP. CDC does not recommend the use of more than one isolation gown or pair of gloves at a time when providing care to patients with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (9,10). Such practices among HCP might be motivated by fear of becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 but instead might increase risks for self-contamination when doffing and for transmission of other pathogens among patients and exacerbate PPE supply shortages. When managing SARS-CoV-2 patients in a dedicated ward, HCP should maintain standard practices (e.g., hand hygiene at indicated times and recommended cleaning and disinfection) intended to prevent transmission of other pathogens (https://www.cdc.gov/infectioncontrol/guidelines/index.html, https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/infection-control.html). Outbreaks such as that described in this report highlight the importance of adhering to recommended infection control and PPE practices and continuing surveillance for novel pathogens like _C. auris_.

[_Candida auris_ is a globally emerging, multidrug-resistant pathogen that causes healthcare-associated infections, associated with high mortality. _C. auris_ has the ability to persistently colonize environmental surfaces, and epidemiologic investigations of hospital outbreaks find widespread _C. auris_ contamination (mattresses, beds, windowsills, chairs, infusion pumps, and countertops) of patients' rooms, and surfaces that were frequently touched, such as computer screens, touchpads and keyboards.

Screening cultures of patients at multiple sites (e.g., axilla, groin, rectum) in nosocomial outbreak settings commonly find asymptomatic colonization, as was found in 52% of patients admitted to the COVID-19 unit in the hospital outbreak described above. Colonized or infected patients frequently have prior extensive contact with multiple healthcare facilities, highlighting the value of careful and thorough communication at transfer. Investigations of the causes of hospital outbreaks frequently find infection control lapses, undoubtedly compounded by the care required for critically ill COVID-19 patients, as found in the COVID-19 unit outbreak described above.

Whole genome sequencing has identified 4 distinct clades that segregate geographically to South Asia (India and Pakistan), South Africa, Venezuela, and Japan with minimal observed intraregion genetic diversity. Genotypes of isolates in the USA were highly related to one another within each state and grouped with isolates from overseas locations: New York isolates grouped in the same clade as isolates from South Asia; New Jersey isolates also grouped with isolates from South Asia but were distinct from those in New York; and Illinois isolates grouped with isolates from South America. These data suggest multiple introductions of _C. auris_ into the USA followed by local transmission within healthcare settings.

_C. auris_ can be misidentified by laboratories and often is resistant to multiple antifungal medications. _C. auris_ isolates are usually resistant to fluconazole, and many are also resistant to amphotericin B. Because isolates are uncommonly resistant to echinocandins (caspofungin, anidulafungin, and micafungin), echinocandins remain the drugs of choice for infections caused by this pathogen, but _C. auris_ can emerge echinocandin-resistant on therapy.

The widespread agricultural application of triazole fungicides and their persistence in the environment can reduce the population of azole-susceptible soil microbiome and act as a significant selective force for the emergence and spread of azole-resistant genotypes. This concern has been recently raised concerning the emergence of drug-resistant _C. auris_ and _Aspergillus_ species (see ProMED posts Candida auris: MDR, emergence due to agricultural use of azoles, susp. 20190407.6409119 and Aspergillosis - USA: multidrug resistance 20180928.6057087). - Mod.ML
