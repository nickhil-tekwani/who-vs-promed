[Feed] given to cattle in a farm in Fthiotida [Phthiotis], Central Greece, came under the microscope this week [week of 10 Mar 2014] as the [holding] was placed in quarantine following the discovery of 2 cases of mad cow disease [bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE)], almost 10 years since the disease last appeared in Greece [see comment].

While samples were sent to London for further investigation, the Agriculture Ministry said the farm had been closed off. Authorities also assured Greek consumers that no contaminated meat had entered the local market.

The cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) were found in 2 dead cows that had been imported from the Netherlands. The animals are thought to be 6 years old.

BSE can be transmitted to humans who eat food derived from the infected cows, particularly if it contains nervous tissue. In humans, the disease is known as new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

Ministry officials noted they were in contact with their Dutch counterparts and were due to inform the European Commission.

Preventive control programs have been running in Greece since 1997.

[The report is in need of clarification. It would be rather unusual to detect BSE simultaneously in 2 cows found dead (?) in a single holding. Following an "incubation" of several years since "infection" (which is considered to take place in young age), the course of clinical BSE ("mad cow") is known to be extended. Confirmation from the reference lab in the UK and additional information, including the date of the cows' importation from the Netherlands, their age at that time, their history since arrival in Greece (e.g., previous holdings) and the sources of feed used in the affected Greek holding, will be helpful. In case BSE is confirmed, tracing their progeny and adult herdmates will be required.

The official BSE status of Greece, according to OIE's code, is "controlled risk," compared to the Netherlands, which has official "negligible risk" status. Noteworthy, Greece has reported, throughout the years, only one BSE case, in 2001. For OIE's table showing the number of BSE cases reported by all countries (excluding the UK, which is covered separately) since 1989, see http://tinyurl.com/ou3abjr.

BSE has acquired its status as a significant public health issue since the discovery, in the mid-90's, that an incurable, invariably fatal degenerative neurological disorder, "variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD)," is caused by the ingestion of BSE-contaminated animal-origin food products.
