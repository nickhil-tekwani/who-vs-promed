----------------------------------------------------------------
As the moderator indicates, the hantavirus most likely involved in these German cases is probably Puumala virus (PUUV), with the bank vole (_Myodes glareolus_) as the rodent reservoir host, although surprisingly enough not stated in this [original press] report. The illness caused by PUUV is the so-called hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), with extremely variable fatality rates, depending not only from the infecting hantavirus species, but also for a big part from the immune response itself of the infected patient. Hence, the terminology used by the current authors of "a potentially deadly disease" has to be translated preferentially as "bearing a fatality rate between 0.1% and 15%", with lowest fatality rate for PUUV-induced HFRS (1), prevalent in most of Europe and European Russia.

It is unusual that a German city like Stuttgart should have become the "epicentre" of a HFRS disease, since urban HFRS outbreaks worldwide are caused in fact by a wild rat-transmitted Seoul hantavirus (SEOV), not by PUUV. Admittedly, it is hard to see Stuttgart suddenly since 2019 as a rat-infested city. If a "bumper year" however means a markedly increase in the local bank vole population (which can reach up to 10-20 times the norm) (1), it can be the consequence of a massive amount of available "mast" (beechnuts and acorns), the autumn before (2018), which by itself is again a consequence of a hot summer the year before (2017), a climate-dependent but recurrent phenomenon described as the "mast connection" (2,3). A profusion of mast was noted indeed during autumn 2018 around several German cities, including Berlin (4).

A statement like "Nowhere else in the world, has there been so many cases (that is, 211 HFRS cases from January up to 15 May 2019)" should be interpreted with the greatest caution, in geographical and historical perspective:
1st, and often forgotten, European Russia registered each year again about 75% of all European PUUV-HFRS cases, with for example, 19 646 HFRS cases (mostly PUUV) in the peak year 1997. In the spring period January to April 2018, 1319 cases were registered in Russia. In the same spring period January to April 2019, the total count was 922 cases of HFRS (5). In the more recent period between 2000 and 2018, Russia registered more than 137 000 HFRS cases (6).
2nd, these impressive numbers remain diminutive however in comparison to the most hantavirus-endemic country in the world, China, which is still responsible for more than 90% of HFRS cases reported worldwide: during an 1950-2014 observation period, the Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission recorded an unsurpassed total of 1 625 002 HFRS cases with 46 968 deaths, or an overall case fatality rate of 2.89%. Admittedly however this was and remains of a mixed origin of Korean prototype Hantaan virus (HTNV) and SEOV (1,7).

Finally, another statement like "More voles equals more infections" might seem evident at 1st sight, but appeared not always so, with increased knowledge of the complex mechanisms (including increased human exposure!), explaining European PUUV-HFRS outbreaks. A more exact statement would be "More PUUV-infected voles equals more human PUUV infections." PUUV prevalence in bank vole populations depend on several changing factors, resulting sometimes in denser vole populations, but with lower PUUV prevalence, hence the recent Belgian study titled: "Why hantavirus prevalence does not always increase with host density: modelling the role of host spatial behaviour and maternal antibodies."(8)

[We thank Dr Clement for his comments, which underscore the need to take a landscape ecological view of hantaviruses, their rodents hosts, the ecological factors that affect those host populations, and human behaviors that determine exposure to the virus. Dr Clement again mentions the need to include SEOV in diagnostic tests for hantavirus infections. With its worldwide distribution in the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_) SEOV can cause human disease at the same time and in places where other hantaviruses are circulating.
