Scientists have evidence that West Nile virus [WNV has survived the winter
in birds and mosquitoes. Testing in Connecticut of a red-tailed hawk found
last month in Westchester County, N.Y., shows it died of the virus.
Mosquitoes found in Queens, N.Y., in January and February also have yielded
WNV, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday.
"It's no longer speculation," said Duane Gubler, director of the CDC's
vector-borne disease program. "There likely will be transmission in the
spring. It's a very strong likelihood the virus will persist." Gubler said
the fact that the virus survived the winter does not change CDC
recommendations. In January, it urged several states to develop larvicide
and monitoring programs.
The hawk was sent to the Northeastern Research Center for Wildlife Diseases
at the University of Connecticut on Feb. 6, where testing showed it died of
the virus. On 4 March 2000, the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station
in New Haven verified the diagnosis. Research Center Director Herbert J.
Van Kruiningen said the findings indicate another outbreak of West Nile is
likely this year. He said there are three ways the hawk might have been
infected: in late fall, before mosquitoes stopped flying; in midwinter, if
a mosquito came out of hibernation; or by eating another infected animal,
either a bird or a mammal. Van Kruiningen suspects the hawk ate another
infected animal, but he doesn't yet know what species might be acting as a
"reservoir" for the virus. "It could be crows or backyard birds of another
variety," he said.
Birds themselves do not pose a threat to humans, but mosquitoes that feed
on them could transmit the virus, which [can cause encephalitis.
Connecticut officials held a press conference Monday to announce a $500,000
larvicide assistance program to help shoreline and some inland towns kill
mosquitoes before they take flight. No mention of the bird's death was made
at the press conference.
"The fact that we have live virus in the first week of February in a bird
may be suggestive the virus may be able to overwinter in birds," John
Anderson, director of the agricultural station, said Monday afternoon. He
said that already had been suspected. Anderson thinks the hawk became
infected in late fall, and harbored the virus in an "quiescent" stage until
recently.
Gubler learned of the hawk's death Monday morning from the Connecticut
Department of Public Health. He said there is no previous evidence the
virus can be present so long before killing a bird or that eating a host
animal can transit the virus. So he wants another test of the bird's
tissue, possibly at a CDC lab. "It hasn't really been described before," he
said. "It's a very important and interesting observation, but it needs to
be verified."
Gubler said the finding that the virus survived the winter in mosquitoes
"reinforces the need to do what Connecticut and New York and New Jersey are
doing - developing and implementing surveillance and prevention plans."
Though several other birds collected in the fall and winter are in storage
at the laboratory at the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Van
Kruiningen said the state won't be [spending money until the new fiscal
year starts in July. "I don't have $10 to use to help us finish the
previous year's work," he said. "The mosquitoes will return in May, and the
money comes in July. Do the math."
Michelle Sullivan, a DEP spokesperson, said DEP officials learned only
recently of the hawk's infection, and that it did not alter the plans the
agency announced Monday.

[Duane is correct in saying that there is no evidence that WNV can be
transmitted orally. The experiment should be done but that is not a
critical issue at this point. The take-home message is that WNV has been
isolated from overwintering mosquitoes and that the virus has persisted
transseasonally. "One robin might not a spring make" but two isolates
portend a very busy spring, summer and fall in the northeastern U.S. and,
perhaps, elsewhere. If the virus has persisted transseasonally in New York,
it likely has persisted transseasonally in areas further to the south,
which had a warmer winter.
That Connecticut does not have as much as $10 to complete studies of
samples collected last year, something is wrong in someone's accounting
department. There is no evidence that WNV entered the U.S. in 1999. It
might have been here since much earlier than that and no one noticed
because routine surveillance has been underfunded. - Mod. CHC
