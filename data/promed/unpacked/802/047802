The 1st case of human infection of avian influenza [A/H5N1 virus
infection] or bird flu this year [2011] has been detected in Dhaka,
confirms the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research
(IEDCR).

IEDCR director Mahmudur Rahman told bdnews24.com that the human
infection was confirmed on Monday [14 mar 2011] after testing the
samples of saliva and nasal swab of a 13-month-old girl running a
temperature, who visited an influenza surveillance centre recently.
The surveillance centre is run jointly by the IEDCR and International
Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases and Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B), he
said.

Family members of the child were also examined, said the IEDCR
director, adding that the girl, undergoing treatment in IEDCR
supervision, was out of danger. IEDCR was also examining the areas
where the child visited with her parents this year [2011], the
director said.

He informed that it was the 2nd case of avian influenza (H5N1) in
humans in the country. Bird flu was detected in a 16-month-old child
from the same area in 2008 and the health department disclosed it
September that year.

The IEDCR director, however, urged everyone not to panic. "There is
nothing to panic as the degree of infection in the girl is very low,"
he said.

Frequent bird flu outbreaks in poultry farms in different places in
the country earlier stoked fears of a serious health threat to
Bangladeshis. "The virus (H5N1) can pass on to humans from poultry any
time given the present situation. It's a public health concern," says
Dr ASM Alamgir, an influenza expert with the World Health
Organisation's Dhaka office. He says in areas currently experiencing
avian influenza outbreaks in poultry, the practice of marketing live
birds may pose a significant risk to the people involved.

"Even people should try to avoid coming into close contact with
pigeons and crows unnecessarily, as lab tests found the presence of
H5N1 in crows during the mass death in 2008 in Dhaka and Chittagong."
He suggests people consume well-cooked poultry products and maintain
bio-security in farms.

Avian flu has so far killed 306 people out of 518 infected in 15
countries and most of these cases have been linked to close contact
with infected poultry or their secretions.

Bangladesh can be a hot spot for emerging infectious and costly
diseases such as bird flu because of population growth and movement,
urbanisation, changes in food production, and other factors,
researches say. IEDCR advises doctors to take history of exposure to
sick poultry while seeing patients with serious respiratory illness,
who might have contracted the deadly strain of human avian influenza
virus.

Livestock experts say maintaining bio-security in poultry farms is the
key to stave off the avian influenza that also brings colossal damage
to the poultry industry with each strike. The world's 1st outbreak of
bird flu among humans occurred in Hong Kong in 1997, when it claimed 6
lives. That outbreak was linked to chickens and classified as H5N1.

[This is only the 2nd human case of avian influenza (H5N1) in humans
to have been recorded in Bangladesh. The previous case was a
16-month-old child from the same area in 2008. Both this infection and
the previous case involved young children and appear to have been
mild, detected during routine influenza surveillance. Confirmation by
WHO is awaited.
