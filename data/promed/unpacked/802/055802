A mass death of cattle has occurred in the Rostov region. In the village of Bolshaya Polyana, Zimovnikovsky district, 13 cows died almost instantly after drinking from a watering hole. The regional veterinary administration reported on its website the animals could have been poisoned with saltpeter. [Another term for potassium nitrate, or simply nitrate. - Mod.TG]

The dead cows were found next to the reservoir on [12 Jul 2022]. The video, filmed on the spot by the son of the owner of the dead animals, appeared on social networks. The footage shows the corpse of a cow near a pond into which sewage is drained.

"Literally in front of our eyes, this cow drank water from there and died. Logically speaking, the poison was deliberately placed here. The cattle died within 15 minutes. 13 heads of cattle died, not counting the calves," said the author of the video.

Their owner found granules of a poisonous substance where the cows died. The owner had not noticed any signs of illness or uncharacteristic behavior in the animals before they died. All 175 cattle on the farm were examined and vaccinated against dangerous diseases in the spring, including rabies, foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax and other infections.

Local residents are sure the cows were poisoned. However, veterinarians still took samples from each cow's remains in order to determine the possible presence of diseases in the dead animals.

Information appeared on social networks about the poisoning of cows in the village of Bolshaya Polyana, Zimovnikovsky district.

Veterinary specialists of the Zimovnikovskaya inter-district station for combating animal diseases immediately went to the site and recorded the death of 13 head of cattle.

According to preliminary data, the animals were poisoned with saltpeter. The owner of the animals found granules of a poisonous substance near the corpses. Other local residents also cite the possibility of poisoning.

The owner did not notice any uncharacteristic behavior or signs of the disease in animals either on that day or earlier. All livestock on the farm, totalling 175 head of cattle, had been examined and vaccinated against contagious, including especially dangerous, animal diseases this spring.

Specialists of the State Veterinary Service confirm the implementation of all anti-epizootic measures provided for by the Plan, including diagnostic tests and vaccinations against rabies, foot-and-mouth disease, anthrax, EMCAR and other infections.

Nevertheless, in order to exclude especially dangerous diseases, veterinarians took samples of pathological material from each of the cattle carcasses. The samples were sent for research to the Rostov Regional Veterinary Laboratory, a branch of the Rostov Regional Station for the Control of Animal Diseases with PO.

Veterinarians disinfected the area. Biological waste (remains of cows) was destroyed in accordance with the requirements of veterinary legislation.

In the Zimovnikovsky district, 13 cows were poisoned by an unknown poison. Residents of the village of Bolshaya Polyana, where the tragedy occurred, reported this to the editorial office of Bloknot Rostov.

According to eyewitnesses, all 13 cows died. Some of them were pregnant. Eyewitnesses sent a video to the editorial office and explained everything that happened near the reservoir, which is frightening the people of Donetsk. Previously, other cows were poisoned on 12 Jul 2022.

The source of poisoning was sewage. The poison was thrown into a pipe at the site, local residents suggest.

Residents reported the incident to the emergency hotline. The information was also passed on to the chief veterinarian of the Zimovnikovsky district. But, according to the residents of the village, they did not react to the problem in any way, no examinations were carried out.

"Then we were told it was too late to conduct examinations. You don't seem to be able to prove anything. We only have samples of these pellets. Just know how our organizations work. Only the 112 service and the district police officer of the Zimovnikovsky district responded," says a local resident.

It is noteworthy that after the information began to be distributed on social networks, the situation was commented on by the regional veterinary department. According to them, saltpeter granules [nitrate granules] were found near the corpses of animals. Therefore, the department assumes the cows were poisoned with this poisonous substance.

The owner did not notice any uncharacteristic behavior or signs of any disease in the animals either on that day or earlier. The entire livestock on the farm, totalling 175 head of cattle, had been examined and vaccinated against contagious, including especially dangerous, animal diseases this spring.

It is also noted the veterinarians took samples of pathological material from each of the remains. The area was disinfected.

"Biological waste (cow cadavers) were destroyed in accordance with the requirements of veterinary legislation," the message also says.

Why the veterinary administration only reacted to what happened a few days later is unclear. The report also indicated the veterinarians "immediately" went to the place after what they saw on social networks. In the video, which was filmed a long time after the death of the cows, the carcasses were removed by the owners themselves.

[All 3 articles are included in this report, as each gives slightly different information regarding the cattle deaths.

Nitrates can accumulate in forage. Nitrates can also be in water. The combination of these 2 sources having nitrates may be more than the animal can handle. However, there is indication there may have been granules, perhaps nitrate fertilizer on the ground. Or, perhaps some granules got into the water and caused the level of nitrates in the water to skyrocket to unreasonable levels.

Hopefully, the investigators took samples of the granules, the water, many of the available forage plants and hopefully the proper tissues from the animals, if they conducted a necropsy on the animals. The granules may be potassium nitrate fertilizer granules. Cattle will often lick these up from the ground as they may taste salty to the animal.

"Nitrate poisoning is a topic coming up often during a drought. Many crops, particularly small grains such as oats, barley, and wheat, as well as corn and a number of weeds are known nitrate accumulators. When the plant is stressed by lack of moisture, nitrates accumulate as the plant roots continue to take up soil nutrients but the plant fails to convert the nitrate into plant proteins, causing nitrate levels to build up in the plant.

"In ruminant animals (such as cattle or sheep), nitrates are fermented in the rumen to nitrite and eventually to ammonia. The rate limiting step in this series of reactions is the conversion of nitrite to ammonia. Unfortunately for the animal, it is the nitrite that is actually toxic. Nitrite is absorbed from the rumen into the bloodstream where it binds with hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the blood protein that transports oxygen to the tissues. Once nitrite has bound with hemoglobin, it forms methemoglobin, a compound that is unable to transport oxygen. When an animal experiences nitrate poisoning, it actually suffocates due to the limited amount of oxygen delivered to the tissues.

"Rapid pulse, heavy breathing, blue mucous membranes, and dark chocolate colored blood are symptoms of nitrate poisoning.

"The risk of nitrate poisoning can be minimized by testing suspect forages for nitrate prior to feeding, blending high nitrate feeds with feeds containing little or no nitrate, and providing nitrate-free water. Since nitrate accumulations are typically greater in the lower 3rd of the plant, animals should not be forced to graze or consume the entire plant if high nitrate levels are present. Harvesting the forage crop as a silage can reduce the nitrate content by approximately 30% once the silage has undergone fermentation.
