AI discovered in 2nd breeder flock in Texas
----------------------------------
A 2nd flock of breeder chickens in Texas has been destroyed after
tests showed some of the birds were infected with avian influenza.
According to state agriculture officials, the 24 000 chickens were
owned by Pilgrim's Pride. The birds were at a farm about 5 miles from
another farm where bird flu was detected 2 weeks ago. A Pilgrim's
Pride spokesman said the birds were destroyed as a "pre-emptive step."
