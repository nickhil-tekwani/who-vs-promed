USA: Suspected foodborne outbreak at national shrine in Missouri
----------------------------------------------------------------
More than 200 people who became ill after meals at the National Shrine of
Our Lady of the Snows may have suffered from norovirus infection -- an
ailment that recently plagued cruise ships, St Clair County health
officials said on Wed 12 Mar 2003. So far, only two people have tested
positive for norovirus infection, but officials believe that the 205 people
who reported illness after meals at the shrine may also have suffered from
the virus because they reported similar ailments.
County officials said they are unsure how the virus was spread at the
shrine near Belleville. "At this time, we cannot link the outbreak to a
specific food or drink consumed at the shrine," said Kevin Hutchison,
executive director of the county Health Department.
Overall, about 20 people were tested for norovirus infection, said Barbara
Hohlt, director of health protection at the county Health Department. She
added that two people also tested negative for the [virus] but could have
still suffered from the virus infection because the virus could have left
by the time they were tested. She said county officials are still waiting
for results on the other 16 people.
People reported feeling ill after attending a Mardi Gras dinner on 28 Feb
2003, a youth event on 1 Mar 2003 1, and a church event on 2 Mar 2003. But
most complaints of illness came from people attending the Mardi Gras event.
At least 106 people reported getting ill after attending that event. After
the reports, the shrine closed its 8 banquet rooms for a couple of days
before reopening Friday. "We still believe this is an isolated incident
that was a one-time occurrence and we don't know how it happened," said Tom
Mulhall, a spokesman for the shrine. "We will put greater attention to
detail, as far as making sure (employees) wash their hands, make sure they
wash serving surfaces, and make sure they wash their hands after coming
into contact with customers."

Specific norovirus responsible for person to person spread
----------------------------------------------------------
A new, highly transmissible strain of norovirus first associated with
outbreaks on cruise ships is now wreaking havoc in long term care
facilities, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports.
Since July 2002, 41 per cent of outbreaks in which strains were
characterized genetically at CDC have been associated with a single, newly
identified strain of norovirus (formerly known as Norwalk-like virus). The
strain has been found in various institutional settings over a wide
geographic distribution, and no common source of the outbreaks has been
identified. The finding of a predominant strain is unusual and contrasts
with surveillance data from 1997 to 2000, which rarely detected identical
strains from distinct outbreaks, CDC reports.
The emerging pathogen has been dubbed the "Farmington Hills" strain, after
the city in Michigan where the first cases were identified. In CDC
laboratory surveillance data, 6 of 11 national outbreaks associated with
the norovirus occurred on land in five states (Alaska, Georgia, Kentucky,
North Carolina, and Utah). The remaining 5 outbreaks occurred on cruise
ships. No epidemiologic link has been identified between land and cruise
ship outbreaks, but the pathogen appears to be more transmissible than
typical noroviruses. Though noroviruses are a common cause of foodborne
illness, the reports suggest that the high activity recently noted is
occurring in closed settings, where person to person spread is the most
likely mode of transmission.
"Speculation that this strain might be perhaps more transmissible person to
person is reflected by a number of points," says Dr Steve Monroe, chief of
the CDC Viral Gastroenteritis Laboratory. "One, the current predominance of
outbreaks in institutional settings and on cruise ships where we assume
that person to person spread is the most predominant form. The second is
that in studies we've done and in studies that have been done in the UK,
looking at different strains, the genetic cluster that this strain falls
into has been statistically associated with outbreaks in nursing home
settings. [That] again suggests that there's something about strains in
this cluster that are more likely to cause them to be transmitted person to
person."
Separate data from individual states confirm continuing norovirus
outbreaks. In New Hampshire, for example, 29 long term care facilities
reported outbreaks of norovirus in 2002. Two long term care residents died,
and 11 other people were admitted to hospital. Control measures in the long
term care facilities included frequent and thorough hand washing, rapid
cleaning of soiled areas, excluding ill staff from work for 48 hours after
resolution of symptoms, halting group activities, and stopping new
admissions into the facilities. New Hampshire officials also detected an
increase in emergency department visits for gastrointestinal illness during
December 2002. Since 1 Jan 2003, an additional 11 norovirus outbreaks have
been reported in institutional settings in New Hampshire, CDC says.
In New York City during the period from 6 Nov 2002 to 13 Jan 2003, 66
outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis epidemiologically consistent with
norovirus infection were reported. Fifty-one of those outbreaks were in
long term care facilities, nursing homes, or rehabilitation facilities,
totaling 1700 people overall. "It is possible that characteristics of this
predominant strain may make it particularly transmissible in certain
settings such as nursing homes," says Marc-Alain Widdowson, DVM, a CDC
epidemiologist investigating the cases. "Control of outbreaks of norovirus
in closed settings can be difficult due to the low infectious dose of the
agent, multiple modes of transmission, and environmental persistence," he
explains. There is a very reliable and complete reporting system for
foodborne outbreaks of this type of virus, but only sentinel surveillance
for person to person transmission. Efforts are under way to develop a
surveillance system for non-foodborne outbreaks of gastroenteritis, which
would gather data on epidemiological and laboratory aspects of outbreaks.
In the absence of a true surveillance system, there are little historical
data to assess the increase in non-foodborne norovirus, he concedes.
"Whenever assessing this type of data, there are a number of pitfalls," he
says. "For instance, clearly there's been a lot of increased interest in
noroviruses because of the cruise ships. So this increased activity could
be attributed to increased reporting because of the increased awareness.
However, when we speak to experienced local health officials, it's clear
that what they're seeing is beyond that.
What they're seeing is a very noted increase in activity in their
experience. [But] there is no formal way of comparing with previous years.
We can't say how much of an increase this is." One peculiarity about
infection with norovirus in general -- from limited studies that have been
done in adult human volunteers - is that there does not appear to be long
term protection following infection with this virus, Monroe adds. "If they
were re-challenged, that is experimentally infected again 2 years later,
there was no protection," he says. "The same people who were ill the first
time became ill the second time. So while there may be short term
protection over a matter of say, 6 months, there does not appear to be
long-term protection." That raises the possibility that the norovirus
problem may pose a recurrent, persistent threat to both long term care
residents and cruise voyagers.
