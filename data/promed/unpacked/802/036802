The European Commission is contented with the measures that Bulgaria
has taken to fight the foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] in the village of
Rezovo and is ready to provide full technical and financial support,
the Bulgarian Agriculture Ministry announced.

On Wednesday [19 Jan 2011], the Bulgarian agriculture minister,
Miroslav Naydenov, visited Rezovo, where the authorities localized a
2nd outbreak of FMD, in addition to the cases in the nearby village of
Kosti in the Burgas District.

In Rezovo, 200 animals owned by 11 farmers have already been slaughtered.

"The owners will receive the 1st compensations of BGN 300 [approx. USD
206] within days. They will also receive additional compensations for
the loss of milk yield because of the 3-month quarantine, which would
prevent them from breeding animals," Naydenov said.

The minister pointed out that the farmers from Kosti have already
received their 1st compensations of BGN 300.

A 3-month quarantine was declared in Rezovo. People who do not live in
the village would not be allowed to pass in a radius of 4 km [2.5 mi].
All vehicles leaving the area will be disinfected.

At the beginning of January [2011], the 1st case of FMD in Bulgaria in
the past 12 years was announced . It was found in a wild boar that has
been killed in the region of the southeastern city of Burgas.

FMD Bulgaria fax no 13
----------------------
Bulgarian authorities have informed that on 18 Jan 2011, 157
susceptible animals were culled (85 cattle, 69 sheep and lambs, and 3
goats) in the Rezovo village. At the time of the culling, aphthae, and
lesions 2 to 10 days old were observed in the mouths of cattle.

Moreover, today [19 Jan 2011], 21 Turkish buffaloes, which penetrated
illegally the territory of Rezovo village, will also be culled and
disposed of. All animal carcasses were buried in a trench in the land
around the village of Rezovo. Disinfection of all premises where
animals have been kept and roads in the village was performed.

Clinical examination of all cattle in other settlements of Burgas
region so far has not revealed any further cases of clinical signs of
FMD.

Turkish officials are opposed to Bulgaria's idea of rebuilding the
border fence between the 2 countries as a measure against the recent
FMD outbreak in Bulgaria.

The planned rebuilding of the border fence will not be an effective
measure against the spread of the disease, according to Hassan Cebi,
head of the Regional Agriculture Department in the city of Kirklareli,
as cited by the Bulgarian National Radio.

He has stated that no infected animals have been found in his region,
while hundreds of Bulgarian farm animals have already been slaughtered
as a preventive measure to stop the FMD outbreak.

The planned rebuilding of the border fortifications, which existed
between the 2 states during the cold war period, was announced on
Tuesday [18 Jan 2011] by Bulgaria's agriculture minister, Miroslav
Naydenov, in the village of Rezovo in Bulgaria's southeasternmost
corner, where Bulgarian authorities localized a 2nd outbreak of FMD,
in addition to the cases in the nearby village of Kosti in the Burgas
District.

[In view of the detection, on 18 Jan 2011, of 10-days-old buccal lesions in
cows in Rezovo, it may be concluded that the virus has now been circulating
within Bulgarian territory for at least 2 weeks; a longer period is not
excluded, if these are 2nd-generation cases.

It will be helpful to note if the alleged Turkish origin of the described
(now culled) buffaloes could be convincingly proven; if the length of their
recent stay on Bulgarian territory could be determined; and if they have
been sampled prior to being culled and tested for NSP (viral nonstructural
proteins). These antibodies are used as indicators of infection,
irrespective of vaccination status. See the paragraph "Nonstructural protein
(NSP) antibody tests" within article 2.1.5. of OIE's Terrestrial Manual,
available at <http://oie.int/eng/normes/mmanual/2008/pdf/2.01.05_FMD.pdf>.

The evidence of the origin of this event being Turkish Thrace is, so far,
circumstantial; the buffaloes could have become the smoking gun.

The actual situation in Turkish Thrace, officially still recognized by the
OIE as an "FMD-free zone with vaccination", deserves to be revisited and
thoroughly investigated. In the apparent absence of clinical
complaints/observations there, an urgent performance of a surveillance
operation, covering large and small ruminants, is prescribed. Ideally,
wildlife (particularly boars) should be included.

8.5.42 to 8.5.48 of the Code at
