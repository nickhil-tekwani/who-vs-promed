[According to the data on the Worldometer website, the total number of cases of COVID-19 worldwide is now 381 491, with 81 171 cases reported by China. There are now a total of 300 320 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 195 countries/locations outside mainland China representing an increase of 43 880 cases when compared with the data on 22 Mar 2020, with the USA accounting for 12 599 cases of the newly confirmed cases, Italy accounting for 4789 cases, and Spain for 6368 cases. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 78.7% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe and the USA is accelerating rapidly as more testing has become available. A global total of 16 553 deaths have been reported, 13 276 outside mainland China.

For the 26th consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. The total number of deaths reported from outside of mainland China is now greater than the total number of deaths reported by mainland China. Mainland China has virtually interrupted local transmission, although imported cases are on the rise and there are small numbers of locally acquired cases periodically being reported. South Korea has slowly decreased daily new case counts hovering below 100 in recent days. Cases in the USA are escalating very rapidly and Europe's rise is equally daunting. It would be interesting to see an epidemic curve by date of onset to see what the true curve of transmission is, as I suspect now that more testing is being done, many of those tested have been sick for days while awaiting testing. - Mod.MPP]

[Unfortunately, after 5 days of no newly confirmed cases in Hubei (or Wuhan), today (23 Mar 2020) there is a single newly confirmed case reported from Wuhan in Hubei province. There are 78 newly confirmed cases reported to have been confirmed in the past 24 hours elsewhere in China, with 74 (94.9%) identified as imported cases. No further information on the other 4 non-imported cases was provided.

According to the report above, a total of 81 171 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 78 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (22 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 7 deaths were reported, all of them in Hubei province. 39 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which bears watching as the cases have been slowly but steadily climbing. And Macau reported 4 additional newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing their total to 25.

Of the 78 newly confirmed cases, 74 were imported cases into China. Cases were reported by Beijing (31), Guangdong (14), Shanghai (9), Fujian (5), Tianjin (4), Jiangsu (3), Zhejiang (2), Sichuan (2), and 1 case each in Shanxi, Liaoning, Shandong, and Chongqing, bringing the total number of imported cases to 427.

Information on the chains of transmission for the newly confirmed non-importation related cases is of interest. Are these 4 cases contacts of imported cases, or contacts of previous cases in their provinces? Or, as speculated (but not confirmed), are they contacts of asymptomatically infected individuals?

[In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 64 cases and 7 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (21-22 Mar 2020) when there were 98 newly confirmed cases. The daily case count has been below 100 newly confirmed cases per day for 3 consecutive days. Daegu continues to stand out as a focal point for transmission with 71.3% of the total cases reported followed by Gyeonbuk with 13.9% of the total cases reported. Looking at recent activity, Daegu reported 40.8% of the newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, followed by Gyeonggi with 19.7% of the newly confirmed cases.

Similar to what is being seen in China, Korea is identifying increasing numbers of imported cases coming from Europe (and I would suspect they are beginning to notice a similar trend in people coming from the USA). They are now up to 67 imported cases in quarantine with the first report of patients in quarantine on 16 Mar 2020 when 4 cases were reported (COVID-19 update (41): global, surge capacity, vaccine development, WHO 20200316.7096222) Like in China, there is strict surveillance and follow-up of these individuals, reversing the pattern of the western countries strengthening screenings of individuals from South Korea and China. There are obvious concerns regarding initiating new clusters that might escape into the community.

According to the English language MOH report from 22 Mar 2020 (https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030):
"Starting (22 Mar 2020), the KCDC is conducting COVID-19 diagnostic testing for every inbound traveler entering from Europe. On the 1st day (22 Mar 2020), of the 1442 inbound travelers from Europe, 152 were symptomatic and were quarantined and tested at airport quarantine facility. The other 1290 travelers were asymptomatic and were moved to a temporary living facility to be tested, 6 of whom returned home after their test results returned negative at 19:00 yesterday (22 Mar 2020). The remaining test results are pending. Travelers who test negative will enter home quarantine (Korean citizens and foreigners with domestic residence) or strengthened active monitoring (foreigners on a short-term trip). Confirmed but mild cases will be transferred to Life Treatment Centers. Severe confirmed cases will be transferred to hospitals by emergency transportation. Travel histories of all inbound travelers will be provided to healthcare providers via the International Traveler Information System (DUR/ITS) for reference."

Clearly these actions are in response to the increasing numbers of imported cases and the concern that these imported cases could initiate new chains of transmission.

----------------------------------------
Regarding health monitoring related to the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] on the national territory, there are 63 927 total cases. At the moment 50 418 people are positive for the virus. 7432 people have recovered. There are 20 692 patients hospitalized with symptoms, 3204 in intensive care, and 26 522 are in home isolation.

There have been 6077 reported deaths, however this number can be confirmed only after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of the death.

I want to highlight -- declared the Head of Civil Protection Borrelli -- the importance of international solidarity; I want to thank Russia, Cuba, China, France, and Germany for welcoming 8 positive patients. I also thank the Italians for the solidarity shown with their donations.

[The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now 63 927 cases, including 6077 deaths, up from 59 138 cases and 5476 deaths reported on 22 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 22 and 23 Mar 2020 was 4789 newly confirmed cases, compared with 5560 newly confirmed cases between 21 and 22 Mar 2020, marking the 3rd consecutive day with decreasing newly confirmed cases, hopefully a trend to be continued. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (28 761), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (8535), and Venice (5505), all in the northern part of the country. Those 3 provinces combined account for 60.9% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. There is an excellent interactive map at http://opendatadpc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/b0c68bce2cce478eaac82fe38d4138b1 to visualize the caseloads per region in near real time.

On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was expanded to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, hopefully the 27.0% decrease in reported cases over the past 72 hours (3 days) is a sign of slowing down of transmission, and not of reporting variance. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this lockdown is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus.

C. Iran: 20 610 cases, 1556 deaths
Date: Mon 23 Mar 2020 21:11 IST

https://www.orissapost.com/127-new-coronavirus-deaths-in-iran-toll-increases-to-1812/


Iran announced Monday [23 Mar 2020], 127 new deaths from the novel coronavirus [COVID-19], raising the official toll to 1812 in one of the worst hit countries along with Italy, Spain, and China. Health ministry spokesman Kianouche Jahanpour said 1411 new cases had been recorded in Iran over the past 24 hours, bringing the total of those infected to 23 049.

Jahanpour, who was speaking during his daily news conference devoted to the pandemic, said he would no longer give a breakdown of cases by province. This was necessary, he said, to avoid sparking undue concern among residents of the most stricken areas and ensure that those in less affected zones remained cautious. All of Iran's 31 provinces have been hit by the novel coronavirus outbreak. Tolls provided by the health ministry in recent days indicated that the spread of the virus has worsened especially in northern and central regions of Iran.

Jahanpour renewed a call by authorities for people to stay at home until 'the virus is conquered'. That call has come as the Islamic Republic is celebrating the Iranian New Year, a time when people usually travel far and wide across the country for holidays and family reunions. Authorities, however, have not imposed any travel ban or lockdown on Iran where the Nowruz [Fri 20 Mar 2020] holiday continues until [3 Apr 2020].

[In the 24 hours from 22 to 23 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 21 638 to 23 049 an increase of 1411 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 1685 to 1812 an increase of 127 deaths in the 24 hour period.

As I mentioned for the past few days, the significant translocation of the population for the holidays is of concern as it may lead to continued intra country/provincial exportations of the virus.

[5] Hypertension and diabetes comorbidities risk factors?

[ref: Fang L, Karakiulakis G, Roth M. Are patients with hypertension and diabetes mellitus at increased risk for COVID-19 infection? Lancet Respir Med. 2020. pii: S2213-2600(20)30116-8. doi: 10.1016/S2213-2600(20)30116-8]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The most distinctive comorbidities of 32 non-survivors from a group of 52 intensive care unit patients with novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the study by Xiaobo Yang and colleagues (1) were cerebrovascular diseases (22%) and diabetes (22%). Another study (2) included 1099 patients with confirmed COVID-19, of whom 173 had severe disease with comorbidities of hypertension (23·7%), diabetes mellitus (16·2%), coronary heart diseases (5·8%), and cerebrovascular disease (2·3%). In a 3rd study (3), of 140 patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19, 30% had hypertension and 12% had diabetes. Notably, the most frequent comorbidities reported in these 3 studies of patients with COVID-19 are often treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors; however, treatment was not assessed in either study.

Human pathogenic coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [SARS-CoV] and SARS-CoV-2) bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels (4). The expression of ACE2 is substantially increased in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who are treated with ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type-I receptor blockers (ARBs) (4). Hypertension is also treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which results in an upregulation of ACE2 (5). ACE2 can also be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. We therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19.

If this hypothesis were to be confirmed, it could lead to a conflict regarding treatment because ACE2 reduces inflammation and has been suggested as a potential new therapy for inflammatory lung diseases, cancer, diabetes, and hypertension. A further aspect that should be investigated is the genetic predisposition for an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which might be due to ACE2 polymorphisms that have been linked to diabetes mellitus, cerebral stroke, and hypertension, specifically in Asian populations. Summarising this information, the sensitivity of an individual might result from a combination of both therapy and ACE2 polymorphism.

We suggest that patients with cardiac diseases, hypertension, or diabetes, who are treated with ACE2-increasing drugs, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 infection and, therefore, should be monitored for ACE2-modulating medications, such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Based on a PubMed search on [28 Feb 2020], we did not find any evidence to suggest that antihypertensive calcium channel blockers increased ACE2 expression or activity, therefore these could be a suitable alternative treatment in these patients.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2] is rapidly spreading worldwide, (1) and WHO declared the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic on [11 Mar 2020] (2).

The outbreak has hit Europe; as of [20 Mar 2020], Italy has the 2nd-largest number of confirmed cases, after China. As elegantly presented by Andrea Remuzzi and Giuseppe Remuzzi (3), a rapid surge of cases is posing a serious threat to the Italian national health system because of the limited capacity of intensive care unit departments. The Italian Government introduced progressive mitigation measurements on [9 Mar and 11 Mar 2020], to drastically limit social interactions and prevent virus diffusion (4,5). Projections in Remuzzi and Remuzzi's exponential model (2), which, according to data trends before [8 Mar 2020], predicted more than 30000 cases by [15 Mar 2020]. Real data from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University suggest a slight deviation from those predictions, with a recorded number of 24 747 cases by [15 Mar 2020], suggesting that measures introduced by [11 Mar 2020], began reducing the number of new cases within 3-4 days.

All other European countries appear to be in a similar situation, with just a short time-lag of a couple of weeks (figure). We urge all countries to acknowledge the Italian lesson and to immediately adopt very restrictive measures to limit viral diffusion, ensure appropriate health-system response, and reduce mortality, which appears to be higher than previously estimated, with a crude case-fatality rate of almost 4% (6).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An estimated 30 million passengers are transported on 272 cruise ships worldwide each year (1). Cruise ships bring diverse populations into proximity for many days, facilitating transmission of respiratory illness (2). SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and has since spread worldwide to at least 187 countries and territories. Widespread COVID-19 transmission on cruise ships has been reported as well (3). Passengers on certain cruise ship voyages might be aged greater than or equal to 65 years, which places them at greater risk for severe consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection (4). During February-March 2020, COVID-19 outbreaks associated with 3 cruise ship voyages have caused more than 800 laboratory-confirmed cases among passengers and crew, including 10 deaths. Transmission occurred across multiple voyages of several ships. This report describes public health responses to COVID-19 outbreaks on these ships. COVID-19 on cruise ships poses a risk for rapid spread of disease, causing outbreaks in a vulnerable population, and aggressive efforts are required to contain spread. All persons should defer all cruise travel worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic.

During [7-23 Feb 2020], the largest cluster of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined in the port of Yokohama, Japan, on [3 Feb 2020] (3). On [6 Mar 2020], cases of COVID-19 were identified in persons on the Grand Princess cruise ship off the coast of California; that ship was subsequently quarantined. By [17 Mar 2020], confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been associated with at least 25 additional cruise ship voyages. On [21 Feb 2020], CDC recommended avoiding travel on cruise ships in Southeast Asia; on [8 Mar 2020], this recommendation was broadened to include deferring all cruise ship travel worldwide for those with underlying health conditions and for persons aged 65 years or older. On [13 Mar 2020], the Cruise Lines International Association announced a 30-day voluntary suspension of cruise operations in the United States (5). CDC issued a level 3 travel warning on [17 Mar 2020], recommending that all cruise travel be deferred worldwide.

Diamond Princess
----------------
On [20 Jan 2020], the Diamond Princess cruise ship departed Yokohama, Japan, carrying approximately 3700 passengers and crew (Table [Demographic characteristics of passengers and crew members on board 2 cruise ships with COVID-19 outbreaks 20 Jan-8 Mar 2020 available at the source URL above]). On [25 Jan 2020], a symptomatic passenger departed the ship in Hong Kong, where he was evaluated; testing confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. On [3 Feb 2020], the ship returned to Japan, after making 6 stops in 3 countries. Japanese authorities were notified of the COVID-19 diagnosis in the passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong, and the ship was quarantined. Information about social distancing and monitoring of symptoms was communicated to passengers. On [5 Feb 2020], passengers were quarantined in their cabins; crew continued to work and, therefore, could not be isolated in their cabins (6). Initially, travelers with fever or respiratory symptoms and their close contacts were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All those with positive test results were disembarked and hospitalized. Testing was later expanded to support a phased disembarkation of passengers.

The remaining passengers who had negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results, no respiratory symptoms, and no close contact with a person with a confirmed case of COVID-19 completed a 14-day ship-based quarantine before disembarkation. Those passengers who had close contact with a person with a confirmed case completed land-based quarantine, with duration determined by date of last contact. After disembarkation of all passengers, crew members either completed a 14-day ship-based quarantine, were repatriated to and managed in their home country, or completed a 14-day land-based quarantine in Japan.

Among 3711 Diamond Princess passengers and crew, 712 (19.2%) had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1 [Cumulative number of confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases by date of detection -- Diamond Princess cruise ship, Yokohama, Japan, February 3-March 16, 2020]). Of these, 331 (46.5%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing. Among 381 symptomatic patients, 37 (9.7%) required intensive care, and 9 (1.3%) died (8). Infections also occurred among 3 Japanese responders, including one nurse, one quarantine officer, and one administrative officer (9). As of [13 Mar 2020], among 428 U.S. passengers and crew, 107 (25.0%) had positive test results for COVID-19; 11 U.S. passengers remain hospitalized in Japan (median age = 75 years), including 7 in serious condition (median age = 76 years).

Grand Princess
--------------
During [11-21 Feb 2020], the Grand Princess cruise ship sailed roundtrip from San Francisco, California, making 4 stops in Mexico (voyage A). Most of the 1111 crew and 68 passengers from voyage A remained on board for a 2nd voyage that departed San Francisco on [21 Feb 2020] (voyage B), with a planned return on [7 Mar 2020] (Table). On [4 Mar 2020], a clinician in California reported 2 patients with COVID-19 symptoms who had traveled on voyage A, one of whom had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. CDC notified the cruise line, which began cancelling group activities on voyage B. More than 20 additional cases of COVID-19 among persons who did not travel on voyage B have been identified from Grand Princess voyage A, the majority in California. One death has been reported. On [5 Mar 2020], a response team was transported by helicopter to the ship to collect specimens from 45 passengers and crew with respiratory symptoms for SARS-CoV-2 testing; 21 (46.7%), including 2 passengers and 19 crew, had positive test results. Passengers and symptomatic crew members were asked to self-quarantine in their cabins, and room service replaced public dining until disembarkation. Following docking in Oakland, California, on [8 Mar 2020], passengers and crew were transferred to land-based sites for a 14-day quarantine period or isolation. Persons requiring medical attention for other conditions or for symptoms consistent with COVID-19 were evaluated, tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and hospitalized if indicated. During land-based quarantine in the United States, all persons were offered SARS-CoV-2 testing. As of [21 Mar 2020], of 469 persons with available test results, 78 (16.6%) had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2.

On [21 Feb 2020], 5 crew members from voyage A transferred to 3 other ships with a combined 13 317 passengers on board. No-sail orders were issued by CDC for these ships until medical logs were reviewed and the crew members tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.

Additional ships
----------------
The Diamond Princess and Grand Princess had more than 800 total COVID-19 cases, including 10 deaths. During [3 Feb-13 Mar 2020], in the United States, approximately 200 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed among returned cruise travelers from multiple ship voyages, including the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess, accounting for approximately 17% of total reported U.S. cases at the time (10). Cases linked with cruise travel have been reported to CDC in at least 15 states. Since February [2020], multiple international cruises have been implicated in reports of COVID-19 cases, including at least 60 cases in the United States from Nile River cruises in Egypt (Figure 2 Cruise ships with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases requiring public health responses -- worldwide, January-March 2020]). Secondary community-acquired cases linked to returned passengers on cruises have also been reported (CDC, unpublished data, 2020).

Discussion
----------
Public health responses to COVID-19 outbreaks on cruise ships were aimed at limiting transmission among passengers and crew, preventing exportation of COVID-19 to other communities, and assuring the safety of travelers and responders. At the time of the Diamond Princess outbreak, it became apparent that passengers disembarking from cruise ships could be a source of community transmission. Therefore, aggressive efforts to contain transmission on board and prevent further transmission upon disembarkation and repatriation were instituted. These efforts included travel restrictions applied to persons, movement restrictions applied to ships, infection prevention and control measures, (such as use of personal protective equipment for medical and cleaning staff), disinfection of the cabins of persons with suspected COVID-19, provision of communication materials, notification of state health departments, and investigation of contacts of cases identified among US returned travelers.

Cruise ships are often settings for outbreaks of infectious diseases because of their closed environment, contact between travelers from many countries, and crew transfers between ships. On the Diamond Princess, transmission largely occurred among passengers before quarantine was implemented, whereas crew infections peaked after quarantine (6). On the Grand Princess, crew members were likely infected on voyage A and then transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to passengers on voyage B. The results of testing of passengers and crew on board the Diamond Princess demonstrated a high proportion (46.5%) of asymptomatic infections at the time of testing. Available statistical models of the Diamond Princess outbreak suggest that 17.9% of infected persons never developed symptoms (9). A high proportion of asymptomatic infections could partially explain the high attack rate among cruise ship passengers and crew. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was identified on a variety of surfaces in cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers up to 17 days after cabins were vacated on the Diamond Princess but before disinfection procedures had been conducted (Takuya Yamagishi, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, personal communication, 2020). Although these data cannot be used to determine whether transmission occurred from contaminated surfaces, further study of fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 aboard cruise ships is warranted.

During the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Diamond Princess was the setting of the largest outbreak outside mainland China. Many other cruise ships have since been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Factors that facilitate spread on cruise ships might include mingling of travelers from multiple geographic regions and the closed nature of a cruise ship environment. This is particularly concerning for older passengers, who are at increased risk for serious complications of COVID-19 (4). The Grand Princess was an example of perpetuation of transmission from crew members across multiple consecutive voyages and the potential introduction of the virus to passengers and crew on other ships. Public health responses to cruise ship outbreaks require extensive resources. Temporary suspension of cruise ship travel during the current phase of the COVID-19 pandemic has been partially implemented by cruise lines through voluntary suspensions of operations, and by CDC through its unprecedented use of travel notices and warnings for conveyances to limit disease transmission (5).

[Take away message: Cruise ships and SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission is a hazardous mix, especially for the high risk population (those 65 years of age or older, and those with comorbidities, a large proportion of cruise ship passengers).

Among the Diamond Princess individuals, approximately 17% had asymptomatic infection with the SARS-Cov-2.

An interesting finding was the viral RNA identification 17 days post disembarkation of the Diamond Princess but it doesn't mentioned whether it was from PCR or from viral cultures. If the former, it is unclear if the RNA came from live virus; if the latter, the viral particles are theoretically able to be transmitted. Studies on the relevance and transmissibility of the virus identified on a variety of surfaces are needed to identify the optimal routes of transmission of this virus. How much of a role do fomites play vs how much is through respiratory droplets and possible aerosolization of viral particles?. - Mod.MPP]

[7] Selected media reports of interest
A. Summer Olympics postponed to 2021
Date: Mon 23 Mar 2020
Source: ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) News [edited]
https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-03-24/tokyo-olympics-will-be-postponed-says-ioc-member-dick-pound/12084658


Australia and Canada both effectively withdrew from the 2020 Games on Monday [23 Aug 2020] as organisers came under global pressure to postpone the event for the 1st time in its 124-year modern history. Mr Pound told Reuters a one-year postponement now looked like the best solution. That would see the Games, currently scheduled for [24 Jul 2020] to [9 Aug 2020], shifted to the northern summer of 2021.

"That's my conclusion [there will be a postponement]," Mr Pound said in a telephone interview. "From reading IOC-speak in the communique, if you are going to cancel you simply cancel because there are no future plans. "But if you are going to carry on with the original objective [to stage the Games] there is no reason to issue a statement because you have already done that over the past several weeks." Japan and the IOC have said calling off the Games entirely is not an option, with the IOC saying a decision on the Games will come in the next 4 weeks.

Pound said a large number of stakeholders, including the organising committee, athletes, broadcasters, and sporting federations, would all need to be consulted before a plan could be finalised. But he said there were early signs of a willingness to accommodate a 2021 Summer Games. World Athletics said on Monday they would be willing to move their 2021 world championships, scheduled for [6-15 Aug 2020] in Eugene, Oregon, to clear a path for a 2021 Olympics.

A postponement would be a blow for host country Japan, which has spent more than USD 20 billion on the Games so far. Huge sums are also at stake for sponsors and broadcasters. But a groundswell of concern from athletes -- already struggling to train as gyms, stadiums, and swimming pools close around the world -- appears to be tipping the balance, along with the cancellation of other major sports events.

The IOC and the Japanese Government have both edged back from weeks of insistence that the Games will go ahead as scheduled. The modern Olympics have never been delayed, though they were cancelled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during the 2 world wars. Major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles Games in 1980 and 1984 respectively.

"The moment the IOC indicates that it is thinking about other solutions, it has already decided to delay the Games," said French Olympic Committee president Denis Masseglia. Yesterday [22 Mar 2020] Australia and Canada both said they would not participate if the Games were not put back to 2021.

The Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) told athletes to prepare for the Olympics to be held in 2021, saying an Australian team "could not be assembled in the changing circumstances at home and abroad". "With travel and other restrictions, this becomes an untenable situation," AOC boss Matt Carroll said.

Olympic gold medallist Jared Tallent told the ABC it was a relief athletes finally had some certainty. "It was getting to the stage where a lot of athletes were struggling to find places to train, and worrying about if they should be going to training with all the government advice that had been going around," the 2012 50-kilometre race walk champion said.

"It's good that this announcement has happened. It will reduce a lot of anxiety and stress that athletes had been feeling over the last couple of weeks."

Japanese authorities seem to be bowing to the inevitable, despite the losses and logistics headaches. "We may have no option but to consider postponing," Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was hoping for a boom in tourism and consumer spending, told parliament.

"Currently, can we hold the Olympics? The world is not in such a place right now." The organising committee is already scaling back the torch relay to avoid crowds, national broadcaster NHK said. Tokyo stocks sensitive to the success of the Olympics surged on Monday [23 Mar 2020], after sharp falls in prior weeks, thanks to expectations of a delay rather than a cancellation.

Pound told Reuters the IOC had tried to hold fire in order to be able to present the hosts, sports federations and sponsors with a clear alternative plan. "Probably what turned the tide in the last couple of days is the curve on the COVID-19 virus. It is getting very, very steep now and this is clearly not something that is going to be under control by June or July -- and probably not by the end of the year [2020]."

*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 00:00 CET

Highlights
----------
- Three new countries/territories/areas from the African Region [1], Region of the Americas [1], and Eastern Mediterranean Region [1], have reported cases of COVID-19.

- The number of COVID-19 cases surpassed 300 000 globally.

- Data reported are based on information received from national authorities by [10:00 AM CET, 23 Mar 2020].

- Diagnostic testing for COVID-19 is critical to tracking the virus, understanding epidemiology, informing case management, and to suppressing transmission. WHO has updated the Laboratory Testing Strategy document (https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/331509/WHO-COVID-19-lab_testing-2020.1-eng.pdf) according to the 4Cs transmission scenarios. All technical guidance can be found at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance.

- WHO Regional Office for Europe has published interim guidance on how to deal with COVID-19 in prisons and other places of detention, available at http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/health-determinants/prisons-and-health/news/news/2020/3/preventing-covid-19-outbreak-in-prisons-a-challenging-but-essential-task-for-authorities.

- World Water Day 2020, celebrated on [22 Mar 2020], highlighted the essential role of hand washing in hygiene to protect you and those around you. WHO Regional Office for Europe provides more information at http://www.euro.who.int/en/health-topics/environment-and-health/water-and-sanitation/news/news/2020/3/world-water-day-2020-highlights-the-essential-role-of-handwashing.

These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or areas with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths. Data as of [12:00 AM 23 Mar 2020], available at the source URL above. I am presenting the regional case totals without the addition of China for consistency in following trends in the regions. - Mod.MPP]

Terms:
- Community transmission is evidenced by chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through routine screening of samples.
- Local transmission indicates locations where the source of infection is within the reporting location.
- Imported cases only indicates locations where all cases have been acquired outside `the location of reporting.
- Under investigation indicates locations where type of transmission has not been determined for any cases.
- Interrupted transmission indicates locations where interruption of transmission has been demonstrated (details to be determined).

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 outside China continues to grow and now totals 189. This includes 16 countries (including 3 territories) from the Western Pacific region, 60 countries (including 6 territories) from the European region, 9 from the Southeast Asia region, 20 countries (including 1 territory) from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 45 countries (including 10 territories) from the Americas region, and 39 countries (including 2 territories) from the African region.

The Americas region appears overinflated due to providing the weekend updates on Monday so it artificially looks as though transmission has skyrocketed with reports of 17 331 newly confirmed cases in the region with 16 354 (94.4%) of the newly reported cases in the region. The European region continues with rapid transmission, having confirmed 20 131 new cases and 1318 deaths in the 24 hours since the last WHO update, with Italy for 27.2% of newly confirmed cases, Spain for 18.1% of newly confirmed cases, and Germany accounting for 16.4% of newly confirmed cases (bringing the total of these 3 countries accounting for 61.8% of newly confirmed cases in Europe).

Figure 2. Epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases reported outside of China, by date of report and WHO region through [20 Mar 2020], at the source URL above, is an excellent representation of the epidemic in China, juxtaposed with the increasing epidemics outside of China. One sees the contribution of the ongoing epidemics in Europe and now the increasing cases in the Americas region, fueled by the USA but other countries are following suit. It would be very nice to see an epidemic curve based on the date of onset of illness. The major increase in cases seen in Figure 2 again are driven by the USA reporting the weekend data.

A somewhat repetitive but necessary reminder: it is clear that the number of reported confirmed cases differs from different reporting websites and is somewhat a function of time of day the website is updated. For example, I note the time we've accessed the Worldometer website, but by the time the post is actually finished with the editing process, those numbers have at times significantly changed. Case counting is clearly a moving target, and, depending upon when the website updates, the numbers may be different. I try to start each post with the latest figures for the calendar day (the Hopkins table) and close with the figures from the start of the calendar day (the WHO tables), defining the calendar day as DST (now GMT-4). - Mod.MPP]
