Re: appearance of a new banana disease in Malaysia near Jasin, Melaka state
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Although few details are given, I believe this is the appearance of
blood disease, a bacterial disease, from across the strait in
Sumatra. This disease is transmitted readily by insects (bees, wasps)
from male bud to male bud. It is epidemic in varieties used to make
chips and in Pisang awak [PA; banana cultivar]. Internally, the fruit
becomes reddish to black and is inedible. The disease may be halted
from spread by breaking off the male buds just after the fruit hands emerge.

In terms of political countries, this would be the 1st appearance of
blood disease outside Indonesia. But in terms of recent spread, it is
"new" to all the big Indonesian islands. It arrived in South Sumatra
only about 15 years ago and has spread 1600 km [994 mi] northward all
the way to Aceh.

I have predicted for some time that it would jump to the Malayan
peninsula. It needs a chain of susceptible clones, Saba types and PA,
to become a mobile epidemic. If it should reach Thailand where PA is
dominant, it would be devastating there. Efforts should be made to
eradicate this reported outbreak. I hope something will be done.

[Blood disease of banana (BD) was first reported in 1905 from a small
island south of Sulawesi, Indonesia. Today it causes major decline of
banana and plantain throughout the country. In 2005, 3 million plants
in Indonesia were affected with an estimated crop loss of over 60 000
tonnes. 'Pisang awak', one of the hardiest and most widely
distributed bananas, is highly susceptible to BD, while 'P kepok,' a
plantain variety (identified earlier by Prof Buddenhagen), is highly
resistant and may prove useful in BD resistance breeding programmes.
The spread of BD is considered a threat to food supplies for
Thailand, Myanmar, Viet Nam, Bangladesh, as well as countries in
Africa and Latin America.

BD as well as the other bacterial wilts of banana known as Moko and
Bugtok, are caused by members of the _R. solanacearum_ species
complex. _R. s._ is a heterogeneous species, which has been divided
into 4 phylotypes (genetic groups). Strains causing Moko and Bugtok
belong to phylotype II, the blood disease bacterium to phylotype IV.
The pathogens can be clearly distinguished by their host range and
other biological and biochemical properties.

_R. solanacearum_ has also been classified into various races and
biovars affecting more than 200 plant species including major crops.
Race 2 attacks banana and plantain, brown rot of potato is associated
with race 3. The bacteria may be spread by mechanical means, water
splash, infected plant material and insects.

Our sincere thanks are due to Prof Buddenhagen for this plausible
suggestion of a possible cause of the banana disease that appears to
be emerging in south-western Malaysia. Confirmation by molecular
methods would be needed for a conclusive diagnosis.
