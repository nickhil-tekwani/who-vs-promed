ISLAMABAD, Aug 30 - At least 18 people have died in a cholera epidemic in
the Pakistani hill resort of Murree, the official Associated Press of
Pakistan said Sunday.
The epidemic in Murree, 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of here, began two
weeks ago, it said. Doctors reported a "marked increase" in the number of
cases and were receiving 10-to-15 patients a day. Murree is a popular hill
station visited by Pakistani and foreign tourists. The news agency said the
health ministry had initiated steps to combat the outbreak.
Doctors, blaming contaminated water for the disease, feared it may spread
to other cities adjoining Murree. They advised tourists to avoid food at
roadside restaurants and not to drink water from springs and streams
muddied after recent monsoon rains.

About a dozen people died last week when cholera gripped northwestern Swat
district, hospital sources said.

[So the cases imported into Norway & the UK from Pakistan over the last few
weeks were signals of these outbreaks. When will they be reported to WHO?
