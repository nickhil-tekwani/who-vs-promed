[Since 2005, Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) has been reported in
the Republic of Congo, Mali, Kenya, Uganda, Morocco, Tanzania and now
in Tunisia. Based on OIE reports, the disease in African countries has
resolved only in Tanzania and Morocco and the rest of countries PPR is
considered as endemic. In Tunisia PPR is reported in one farm and
cause of outbreak has not yet been established. PPR, also called Kata
(a vernacular west-African name), pseudorinderpest, and
stomatitis-pneumoenteritis complex, is an acute contagious disease of
small ruminants. Goats and sheep are the species primarily affected,
with highest pathogenicity in goats. PPR is caused by a paramyxovirus
of the genus _Morbillivirus_. It is antigenically very similar to the
rinderpest virus. Further description of the disease is available
(Peste des petits ruminants - Morocco: ovine, OIE 20080724.2248) -
Mod.NM

PPR is sometimes referred to as Pseudorinderpest because its effect
on sheep and goats has some parallels clinically and epidemiologically
to Rinderpest in cattle. PPR or pseudorinderpest is very disruptive
to small ruminant populations and a major disease of sheep and goats
in West Africa, although the kind of explosive outbreaks that
characterize the classic pandemics of Rinderpest of 18th and 19th
century are not the rule for PPR in many places currently.

The analogous nature of Peste des petite ruminants and Rinderpest as
well as the fact that OIE and FAO will declare worldwide freedom from
Rinderpest disease later this month in Paris begs the questions of the
potential for PPR eradication. Rinderpest eradication in cattle,
following on the heels of smallpox eradication in humans, represents
the 2nd example of a successful viral disease eradication campaign.
Rinderpest is particularly closely tied to the history of the
veterinary profession whose origins literally started with Rinderpest
as detailed in the OIE editorial quoted below -- In 1761, Claude
Bourgelat managed to persuade King Louis XV of France of the need to
train specialists to treat animal diseases. By decision of the King,
the world's 1st veterinary school was established in Lyon, France.
Bourgelat was a true visionary. He had secured the King's support
because rinderpest was ravaging Europe's countryside and ruining the
rural economy. See

While the eradication of Rinderpest is a tremendous boon to animals,
humans and societal well-being, it will be interesting to see if the
momentum and veterinary infrastructure created by the Rinderpest
Eradication campaign can then be leveraged to eliminate PPR or some
other animal disease. Resources are critical but taking on Peste des
petite ruminants may be just the challenge that is needed to keep the
world's veterinary community sharp when it comes to disease control,
prevention and eradication. - Mod.PC]
