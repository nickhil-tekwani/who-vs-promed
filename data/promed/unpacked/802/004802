Influenza virus in Norway resistant to oseltamivir
--------------------------------------------------
As the Norwegian Institute of Public Health reports, influenza activity in
Norway is currently at a low level but is increasing. Of 16 influenza
A(H1N1) viruses examined for resistance this season, 12 are resistant
against the anti-influenza drug oseltamivir (Tamiflu). The Norwegian
Institute of Public Health requests Norwegian physicians treating patients
with influenza to be aware of this if considering antiviral treatment.
The influenza activity in Norway is still low, but have increased since the
start of the year [2008] and further increase is expected in the comng
weeks. Influenza virus A(H1N1) that dominates this winter, usually gives a
milder disease than A(H3N2) which dominated the previous season.
Influenza may be a serious disease for certain groups of patients, who are
therefore offered vaccination. Antiviral treatment is mainly recommended
for patients with severe influenza and to patients with severe underlying
disease if they get influenza. Every season, the Norwegian Institute of
Public Health collects some influenza strains from the whole country for
closer analysis for surveillance purposes. Some of these viruses are sent
to the WHO influenza collaborating centre in London for resistance testing
and other analyses. [The] dominating virus this season, both in Norway and
the rest of Europe, is influenza A (H1N1) Solomon Islands. A total of 12 of
16 A(H1N1)-virus from different patients from various places around the
country have been shown to be highly resistant to oseltamivir (Tamiflu).
The virus is susceptible to other anti-influnza drugs [Relenza, amantadine,
rimantadine ? - Mod.CP]. The patients have not had more serious disease
than expected with influenza.
Norway is participating in international collaboration on surveillance and
advice on influenza with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and
Control (ECDC), the influenza network EISS and the World Health
Organization (WHO). This event has been notified to WHO under the
International Health Regulations.

[The most recent weekly report [25 Jan 2008] of the European Influenza
Surveillance Scheme (EISS;
<http://www.eiss.org/cgi-files/bulletin_v2.cgi?display=1&code=250&bulletin=250>)
states that there is currently medium or high influenza activity in 16
European countries (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Hungary, Ireland,
Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Northern Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania,
Slovenia, Spain, and Switzerland). In week 03/2008, a further increase in
consultations for influenza-like-illness (ILI) and/or acute respiratory
infection (ARI) was reported by several countries and was most obvious for
Hungary, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, and Switzerland. Of the total
virus detections since week 40/2007 (n=3447), 81 per cent were influenza A
of which about 99 per cent were of the H1 subtype. For the intensity
indicator, the national network levels of influenza-like illness (ILI)
and/or acute respiratory infection (ARI) were high in Bulgaria, Luxembourg,
and Switzerland, medium in Austria, Belgium, France, Hungary, Ireland,
Italy, Lithuania, Northern Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia,
Spain, whilst they remained low in 11 other countries that reported this
indicator. For the geographical spread indicator, 11 countries (Austria,
Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Slovenia and Spain, Switzerland) reported widespread activity, 3 countries
regional activity, 5 countries local activity, 7 countries sporadic
activity and one country reported no influenza activity.
It remains to be established to what extent oseltamivir resistance is a
general phenomenon throughout Europe, or whether it is restricted to Norway
possibly as a consequence of greater availability of oseltamivir treatment
in Norway. The question of the degree of resistance is also of relevance;
whether resistance is complete or only partial as been has been observed in
the case of some isolates of H5N1 avian influenza virus from human
patients. - Mod.CP]
