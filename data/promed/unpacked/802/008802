The suspected viral outbreak in South-West [in Western Australia] horses comes after a veterinarian found some horses to have mouth papules, from information the Department of Agriculture and Food released last week regarding a suspected virus outbreak among horses.

Horses in the South-West have been found to have mouth papules and while there has been talk of it being the pox virus _Molluscum contagiosum_, a mild self-limiting skin disease which only affects children, experts say it is unlikely.

The department has taken samples to identify the cause of the papules after being contacted by a private veterinarian who attended to the horses. Preliminary tests suggest the papules might be a response to a viral infection and testing is continuing.

Currently there are no restrictions on horse movements in Western Australia, and the department reminds horse owners if they do notice unusual signs in their horses to contact their local veterinarian.

The department's standard horse biosecurity recommendations are that only healthy horses should attend racing events and they should not share feed, water, or tack and equipment with other horses.

[If it is _Molluscum contagiosum_, this virus usually infects children and is endemic worldwide. _M. contagiosum_ is a common benign skin disease that is caused by a poxvirus, classified as the single species in the genus _Molluscipoxvirus_ in the subfamily _Chordopoxvirinae_. _M. contagiosum_ virus has not been propagated in cultured cells, but restriction-fragment length analysis suggests that at least 4 strains exist. And if it were _M. contagiosum_ in these horses, we would probably have seen it before in other non-human hosts. Hopefully clarification is on its way.
