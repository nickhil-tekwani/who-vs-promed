China's north western Gansu province has reported an outbreak of the highly epidemic H5N1 bird flu virus in poultry, the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) announced on Wednesday [6 Jun 2012]. More than 6200 chickens at a farm in a village in Luyang, a town in Jingtai county, showed symptoms of suspected avian flu on Friday [1 Jun 2012], and 260 of them have died, according to the MOA.

The National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory on Tuesday [5 Jun 2012] confirmed the epidemic was H5N1 bird flu after testing samples collected at the farm, the MOA said.

Local authorities have sealed off and sterilized the infected area, where a total of 18 460 chickens have been culled and safely disposed of in order to prevent the disease from spreading since the case was confirmed, according to the MOA. A team was dispatched by the ministry to the quarantined area to guide epidemic prevention and monitoring.

Bird flu, or avian influenza, is a contagious disease of animal origin caused by viruses that normally infect only birds and, less commonly, pigs. It can be fatal to humans.

[China has already informed the OIE about this HPAI H5N1 outbreak in poultry, which is the 5th in mainland China since the start of the current wave on 2 Dec 2011. Data on all 5 outbreaks and an interactive map are available at http://web.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=11376.

China's wet-markets have recently been again shown to be a potential source for human infection; see the postings on the current case in Hong Kong, apparently infected in Guangdong. - Mod.AS
