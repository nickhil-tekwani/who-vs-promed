A legionnaires' disease outbreak at a northern Spain resort has affected at least 12 people and killed 1 this summer [2017], according to a local media report (computer translated).

The outbreak occurred at a resort in Liérganes, Cantabria, which prompted the closure of part of the facility.

The Cantabrian Health Service has reported in a statement that the 1st cases were detected on [7 Aug 2017] when the epidemiological surveillance system warned that 2 people who had stayed in the spa had required hospitalization for pneumonia outside Cantabria.

On that same day, the Environmental Health section carried out an inspection of all the facilities, in which, among other measures, samples were taken of the spa's thermal water circuits and the hot water was checked in the rooms where the affected people were housed.

After the results were known, and when 2 positives were confirmed in the samples, several plants were stopped and a disinfection treatment was ordered.

[Liérganes is a town, with a population of 2391 residents in 2007, located in the autonomous community of Cantabria, Spain (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liérganes). Cantabria is an autonomous community on the Bay of Biscay; Santander is its capital city (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantabria). Liérganes has a spa built in 1913; the spa's therapeutic techniques include "aerosol, bath, manual massage, parafangos [paraffin/mud wrap (http://www.livestrong.com/article/78390-parafango-massage-treatment-cellulite/)], showers, and sprays" (http://www.spain.info/en_US/que-quieres/salud-belleza/balnearios/cantabria/balneario_de_lierganes.html). The spa is surrounded by several hotels (http://tinyurl.com/y7dqr83r).

The news report above fails to say what exposures to possible environmental sources of _Legionella_, such as hotels or the spa at Liérganes, that the affected individuals had in common. More information in this regard would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources.
