Re: Cassava brown streak disease (ProMED-mail post 20090702.2387)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Just to note that there is hope on the horizon versus both cassava
mosaic disease (CMD) and cassava brown streak virus (CBSV).
Conventional breeding can solve both these problems:

1. Kiddo Matunda is a PhD student of the African Centre for Crop
Improvement [ACCI] based at the Kibaha Research Station in Tanzania.
She has been breeding cassava varieties that are resistant to both
CMD and CBSV, over the last 4 years. She should be in a position to
release resistant materials in the near future.

2. Dr Theresia Munga of KARI [Kenya Agricultural Research Institute],
and an ACCI graduate, is in Kenya, and is based at the government
research station in Mombasa. She has bred CMD and CBSV resistant
cassava varieties for the last 4 years and has material that could be
released to Uganda.

The aspect of rapid multiplications would need to be addressed.

[Cassava brown streak (or root rot) disease is caused by _Cassava
brown streak virus_ (CBSV; tentative member of genus _Ipomovirus_),
and cassava mosaic disease (CMD) is caused by a number of species and
strains in the genus _Begomovirus_. Both CBSV and the CMD viruses
have whitefly vectors and pose a threat to food security in sub-
Saharan Africa.

Crop varieties resistant to different CMD strains were developed for
local use, for example by the International Institute of Tropical
Agriculture (IITA). These have alleviated the problem in some areas,
but in others the new varieties are being wiped out by brown streak.
Furthermore, a new more virulent strain of CMD has been reported
recently from West Africa (ProMED-mail post 20090423.1528).

The work described above aims at managing both diseases
simultaneously. This is a most promising approach, if the question of
mass multiplication of germplasm for distribution to farmers can be
addressed, and if breeding programmes can be sustained in the long
term to keep up with new emerging strains of the different viruses.
The involvement of a number of different viruses able to mutate
independently represents a particular challenge to the development of
resistant cultivars, and different crop varieties may be needed that
are geared towards local viral populations.

Our sincere thanks are due to Prof Laing for this important contribution.
