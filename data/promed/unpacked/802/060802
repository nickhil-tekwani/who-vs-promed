Liberian health authorities on Tuesday [10 Apr 2018] issued an alert on the possible outbreak of monkeypox, an infectious disease found mostly in central and western Africa.

Liberia's chief medical officer Francis Kateh said the disease, caused by the monkeypox virus, has already been discovered in the southern county of Rivercess.

Kateh said there are currently 4 confirmed cases of the disease. A couple of suspected cases have also been sent for testing.

According to the health official, the time from exposure to the onset of symptoms of monkeypox is around 10 days, while the duration of symptoms is typically from 2-5 weeks.

He said the virus may be spread from handling bushmeat, an animal bite or scratch, body fluids, contaminated objects, or close contact with an infected person.

Monkeypox was 1st identified in 1958 amongst laboratory monkeys. The 1st human cases were discovered in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Fever, itchy toes, headache, muscle pain, and swollen lymph nodes, among others, have been identified as the symptoms of the disease.

The disease is not deadly [West Africa virus clade] and can be cured [partially prevented] through the smallpox vaccine.

Last year [2017], the west African country Nigeria recorded 172 suspected and 61 confirmed cases of monkeypox disease between September and December 2017.

[The above report provides no information about the situation in which these 4 cases became infected, nor any information about the clade the responsible monkeypox virus belongs to.

Monkeypox (MPX) virus infections are not as benign as the above report suggests. As noted in an earlier post (Monkeypox - Africa (04) 20180327.5712702), monkeypox is a zoonotic orthopoxvirus with a similar disease presentation to smallpox in humans, with the additional distinguishing symptom of lymphadenopathy. After an initial febrile prodrome, a centrifugally distributed maculopapular rash develops, with lesions often present on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The infection can last up to 4 weeks, until crusts separate, and a fresh layer of skin is formed. Sequelae include secondary bacterial infections, respiratory distress, bronchopneumonia, gastrointestinal involvement, dehydration, encephalitis, and ocular infections, which can result in permanent corneal scarring. The virus occurs in 2 clades: The West Africa clade, with low to nil mortality, and the Central Africa clade that has a 10-17 percent fatality rate.

The main reservoirs of monkeypox virus are suspected to be rodents, including rope squirrels (_Funisciurus_ spp; an arboreal rodent) and terrestrial rodents in the genera _Cricetomys_ and _Graphiurus_). Halting the bushmeat trade and consumption of wild animals in order to halt MPX virus exposure will be culturally and economically difficult, so continued occurrence of cases can be expected.

Although ProMED-mail has not posted cases of MPX in Liberia before, a recent publication indicates that there have been 4 cases in that country in Grand Gettah in 1970 and 2 cases in Rivercess and Maryland counties in 2017. There have been MPX cases this year (2018) in Nigeria and the Central African Republic.
