PFIESTERIA AND POLLUTION: REQUEST FOR INFORMATION
-------------------------------------------------
[see Toxic algae - North Carolina: an update 970331100029]

From: "Paul D. Millikin" <millikin@mtco.com>
_Pfiesteria piscicida_, a dinoflagellate along the East and Gulf
coasts, is much in the news these days, but I could find precious little
factual data about it on MedLine.
Apparently it has been responsible for massive fishkills, and its
neurotoxin can cause severe and long-lasting damage to any humans who are
exposed to it, as in swimming through a "Red Tide" or eating contaminated
fish or shellfish.
North Carolina seems to be its main focus at the moment, where it has been
related to surface waters polluted by large hog farms. Hogs are said to
excrete up to 5 times as much sewage as humans, so on a modern hog farm,
with 10,000 residents or so, disposal of hog sewage definitely becomes a
major problem.
In today's (April 20) Peoria Journal Star, there is a rather
sensationalized article headlined: KILLER ORGANISM LATEST THREAT FROM GIANT
HOG FARMS. It was probably motivated by current negotiations to build such
a farm a few miles downriver from us.
In media-browsing from North Carolina, I got the impression that hog sewage
contains large amounts of phosphate, and that promotes growth of the "Red
Tide" in ocean waters and estuaries. However, Peoria is somewhat removed
from the oceans, and while I'm not at all eager to pour hog sewage into the
Illinois River, I have the impression that hogs are NOT affected by and do
NOT excrete Pfiesteria cysts.
Am I right? Any authoritative input would be MOST welcome! The thought of
all that hog sewage turns my stomach, but so far, I can't regard hog farms
as a "Red Tide" threat to the Middle West.
[I have obtained some "authoritative" information on hog wastes, pollution
and overgrowth of Pfiesteria and will post it. I am also looking into what
we know about the human and animal health effects and will add that as my
calls are returned. Mod.-pc]
