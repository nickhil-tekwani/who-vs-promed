A highly infectious respiratory virus is being blamed for the deaths
of 5 elderly people at a nursing home in Westmead, Sydney. According
to reports, 50 people contracted respiratory syncytial virus
[infection; RSV], akin to a severe chest infection, at the Mayflower
Nursing Home. Contagious like a common cold, the illness spread
rapidly and Mayflower reportedly put infection control procedures in
place. They were compelled to close the facility to the public.

NSW [New South Wales state] Health inspected the nursing home when
the outbreak was reported and found no obvious breach of protocols or
hygiene. "A number of those people became quite ill and unfortunately
some of those people did die," says Dr Vicky Sheppeard from NSW Health
addressing the unusual loss of 5 people within the same facility in a
month. "It's been extraordinarily difficult, it's been very sad and
the staff have at all times worked to the standards we really expect
of them." she continued.

It is believed that the infection was brought into the nursing home
by a visitor. Currently there is no vaccine to protect against
respiratory syncytial virus.

[This is the 1st ProMED-mail report of RSV associated fatalities in
adults.

The USA CDC site states
(http://www.cdc.gov/rsv/about/infection.html), "RSV can cause upper
respiratory infections (such as colds) and lower respiratory tract
infections (such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia). In children under 1
year of age, RSV is the most important cause of bronchiolitis, an
inflammation of the small airways in the lung.

Almost all children will have had an RSV infection by their 2nd
birthday. When infants and children are exposed to RSV for the first
time, 25-40 per cent of them have signs or symptoms of bronchiolitis
or pneumonia, and 0.5-2 per cent will require hospitalization. Most
children hospitalized for RSV infection are under 6 months of age.

Infants and children infected with RSV usually show symptoms within 4
to 6 days of infection. Most will recover in 1 to 2 weeks. However,
even after recovery, very young infants and children with weakened
immune systems can continue to spread the virus for 1 to 3 weeks.

People of any age can get another RSV infection, but later infections
are generally less severe. The elderly and adults with chronic heart
or lung disease or with immune systems weakened by medical conditions
or treatments remain at high risk for developing severe RSV disease if
reinfected."

This unfortunate situation illustrates the susceptibility of elderly
individuals to serious RSV infection.
