Infected deer meat behind tribals' death?
-------------------------------------
MYSORE: Mystery shrouds the death of four tribals from Hosahalli Haadi in
Heggadadevanakote taluk on Wednesday (14 July 1999). They had complained of
stomach pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomitting, but what was the disease that
afflicted them is not known. The deaths have left the tribals in the area in
a state of panic. Masti (aged 22), Basavi (50), Kutti (7) and Mara (18) died
on Wednesday. Four other tribals from surrounding hamlets, too, complained
of the same symptoms. Two of them are being treated at the Shankara
Community Health Centre, run by the Vivekananda Youth Movement (VYM) near N.
Begur village, while the other 2 have been discharged.
The district administration and health department officials who visited the
hamlet say it could be gastroenteritis or food poisoning. "However, we can
arrive at a conclusion only after seeing the results of the pathological
tests carried out on their blood and serum samples," a source in the
district health office said, adding that the deaths could also have been due
to some epidemic.
However, what has given a new twist to the mystery deaths is the official
ignorance of the death of animals, especially a large number of deer in the
forests of Heggadadevanakote and Gundlupet taluks last fortnight and the
NGOs linking the deaths of these animals and those of the tribals
VYM chief and hospital head Dr Balasubramaniyam supports the theory that the
disease could have spread from the animals. He has succeeded in giving
timely treatment to affected tribals, saving them when the government
doctors failed to reach the spot on time. He suspects anthrax could have
caused the death of the tribals. "The tribals may have contracted the
disease by eating the meat of dead deer, reportedly consumed by the deceased
two days ago," he told The Times of India. "All the tribals admitted to my
hospital with complaints of stomach pain and vomiting are recovering and the
line of treatment adopted by us strongly indicates that the deaths are due
to anthrax," he added.

Mystery death takes its toll, this time on a seven-year-old
-------------------------------------
MYSORE: One more death was reported from Hosahalli Haadi in
Heggadadevanakote on Saturday, bringing the total number of deaths to 5.
The child reportedly died due to anthrax. The 7-year-old, who succumbed to
the disease was the daughter of Mara, one of the four tribals who died on
Wednesday.
According to Dr Balasubramanium of Vivekananda Youth Movement (VYM), [a few
more tribals complaining of diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting were admitted at
the Shankara Community Health Centre, run by VYM. However, he said the
tribals members were infected not only by the consumption of dead deer meat,
but also by
eating the meat of other dead animals in the forest.
District Health Officer Dr D.S. Jagadish and Joint Director of Health
Department have visited the tribal belt to find out the exact reason for the
deaths.

MYSORE: At a press meet here on Sunday, the Mysore Deputy Commissioner Mr
Sreenivaschar said the government has initiated necessary measures to
prevent the spread of disease to new areas. Doctors and para medical staff
have been posted to the affected areas to treat the tribals, he said.
"We are also trying to find out the exact cause of death of 8 elephants in
the last two months and waiting for results of the tests carried out on the
serum and blood of the dead pachyderms," he added.

[Obviously we must await harder information before ascribing the cause of
this outbreak seemingly involving humans (5 deaths and 4 recoveries), deer
(numbers not given), and possibly 8 elephants. That the authorities have
apparently failed to come up with a diagnosis for the elephants' deaths
after two months must raise concerns as to the veterinary capability in the
area, if nothing else - MHJ
