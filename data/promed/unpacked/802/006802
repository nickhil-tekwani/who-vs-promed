State health officials reported on [Tue 17 Sep 2019] an _E. coli_ infection outbreak believed to have originated from the Minnesota State Fair.

A total of 11 Minnesota residents who attended the Minnesota State Fair have tested positive for _E. coli_ O157, state investigators announced in a news release. The 11 attended the fair between [25 Aug and 2 Sep 2019] and became ill in the days following their visits. Six of those individuals were hospitalized and 1 developed a potentially fatal complication, department of health officials said. One person remains hospitalized. The people identified with the sickness ranged in age from 2 to 43 years.

Department heads said they are working with fair officials to track down the source of the outbreak. Initial evidence indicates that the infection was contracted after interacting with livestock. Most of those infected said they visited the Miracle of Life exhibit and touched calves, goats, sheep or piglets. Others could have contracted the infection after touching infected rails or surfaces.

Early lab tests showed that the strains of _E. coli_ O157 were closely related, state health officials said, but additional testing will continue in an effort to determine the source of the infections.

"These infections can have serious health impacts and there is always a chance that an ill person can pass along the infection to others through close contact," State Public Health Veterinarian Joni Scheftel said in a news release. "Anyone who believes they may have developed an _E. coli_ O157 infection should contact their health care provider. _E. coli_ O157 infections should not be treated with antimicrobials as this might lead to serious complications."

Symptoms of the infection include stomach cramps, diarrhea, bloody stool and low-grade fever. The infection can occasionally lead to serious complications, especially in young children, the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. Children with diarrhea shouldn't attend childcare to avoid the spread of infection.

[The following is extracted and edited from https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2019/09/publishers-platform-minnesota-state-fair-reports-e-coli-cases-linked-to-animal-contact-what-a-surprise/:

"The risk of transmission in exhibition settings of zoonotic diseases in general and _E. coli_ O157:H7 in particular is not - or should not be - news. A survey as far back as 2003 of the literature, including CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), revealed at least 23 outbreaks of zoonotic disease, including illnesses from _E. coli_ O157:H7, associated with animal exhibitions in the UK and the USA. These prior outbreaks included an _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak associated with a county fair in Medina, Ohio, in August 2000; 2 _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreaks in Pennsylvania in 2000 and 2001 associated with farm animals; 92 _E. coli_ O157:H7 cases associated with the Wyandot County Fair in Ohio in September 2001; and the largest _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak in Oregon history at the Lane County Fair in September 2002. And, over the last decade there is not a year that has gone by that many other outbreaks have left hundreds and hundreds sickened.

"In addition, research has shown that _E. coli_ O157:H7 is prevalent even among the prize livestock exhibited at agricultural fairs. A 2003 study on the prevalence of _E. coli_ O157: H7 in livestock at 29 county and 3 large state agricultural fairs in the USA found that _E. coli_ O157:H7 could be isolated from 13.8% of beef cattle, 5.9% of dairy cattle, 3.6% of pigs, 5.2% of sheep, and 2.8% of goats. Over 7% of pest-fly pools also tested positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7.

"Against this backdrop, the CDC published recommendations for reducing the risk that enteric pathogens will be transmitted at petting zoos, open farms, and animal exhibits. The most updated version of these recommendations can be found on CDC's MMWR Web site. These recommendations arise out of several documented outbreaks in which enteric pathogens were passed to humans in such settings. Draft recommendations were published in MMWR on [20 Apr 2001]; readers were invited to submit comments and suggestions; and the final recommendations were posted on the Internet on [16 Oct 2001]. The recommendations encapsulated on the CDC Web site and in MMWR were created by the National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHN). Many of the recommendations are common sense:

"Venue operators should take the following steps:
------------------------------------------------
- Become familiar with and implement the recommendations in this compendium.
- Consult with veterinarians, state and local agencies, and cooperative extension personnel on implementation of the recommendations.
- Become knowledgeable about the risks for disease and injury associated with animals and be able to explain risk-reduction measures to staff members and visitors.
- Be aware that direct contact with some animals is inappropriate in public settings, and this should be evaluated separately for different audiences.
- Develop or obtain training and educational materials and train staff members.
- Ensure that visitors receive educational messages before they enter the exhibit, including information that animals can cause injuries or carry organisms that can cause serious illness.
- Provide information in a simple and easy-to-understand format that is age and language appropriate.
- Provide information in multiple formats (eg, signs, stickers, handouts, and verbal information) and languages.
- Provide information to persons arranging school field trips or classroom exhibits so that they can educate participants and parents before the visit.

"Venue staff members should take the following steps:
-----------------------------------------------------
- Become knowledgeable about the risks for disease and injury associated with animals and be able to explain risk-reduction recommendations to visitors.
- Ensure that visitors receive educational messages regarding risks and prevention measures.
- Encourage compliance by the public with risk-reduction recommendations, especially compliance with hand-washing procedures as visitors exit animal areas.

"Recommendations for nonanimal areas are as follows:
----------------------------------------------------
- Do not permit animals, except for service animals, in nonanimal areas.
- Store, prepare, serve, or consume food and beverages only in nonanimal areas.
- Provide hand-washing facilities and display hand-washing signs where food or beverages are served.
- Entrance transition areas should be designed to facilitate education.
- Post signs or otherwise notify visitors that they are entering an animal area and that there are risks associated with animal contact.
- Instruct visitors not to eat, drink, smoke, and place their hands in their mouth, or use bottles or pacifiers while in the animal area.
- Establish storage or holding areas for strollers and related items (eg, wagons and diaper bags).
- Control visitor traffic to prevent overcrowding.
- Exit transition areas should be designed to facilitate hand washing.
-Post signs or otherwise instruct visitors to wash their hands when leaving the animal area.
- Provide accessible hand-washing stations for all visitors, including children and persons with disabilities. Position venue staff members near exits to encourage compliance with proper hand washing.

"Recommendations for animal areas are as follows:
-------------------------------------------------
- Do not allow consumption of food and beverages in these areas.
- Do not allow toys, pacifiers, spill-proof cups, baby bottles, strollers, or similar items to enter the area.
- Prohibit smoking and other tobacco product use.
- Supervise children closely to discourage hand-to-mouth activities (eg, nail biting and thumb sucking), contact with manure, and contact with soiled bedding. Children should not be allowed to sit or play on the ground in animal areas. If hands become soiled, supervise hand washing immediately.
- Ensure that regular animal feed and water are not accessible to the public.
- Allow the public to feed animals only if contact with animals is controlled (eg, with barriers).
- Do not provide animal feed in containers that can be eaten by humans (eg, ice cream cones) to decrease the risk of children eating food that has come into contact with animals.
- Promptly remove manure and soiled animal bedding from these areas.
- Assign trained staff members to encourage appropriate human-animal interactions, identify and reduce potential risks for patrons, and process reports of injuries and exposures.
- Store animal waste and specific tools for waste removal (eg, shovels and pitchforks) in designated areas that are restricted from public access.
- Avoid transporting manure and soiled bedding through nonanimal areas or transition areas. If this is unavoidable, take precautions to prevent spillage.
- Where feasible, disinfect the area (eg, flooring and railings) at least once daily.
- Provide adequate ventilation both for animals and humans.
- Minimize the use of animal areas for public activities (eg, weddings and dances). If areas previously used for animals must be used for public events, they should be cleaned and disinfected, particularly if food and beverages are served.

"In addition, the Pennsylvania legislature enacted a law mandating standards for animal exhibition sanitation. The Pennsylvania law requires animal exhibit operators to "promote public awareness of the risk of contracting a zoonotic disease" by posting notices. The law further requires adequate hand-cleansing facilities and prohibits the exhibition of any animal not properly cared for by a veterinarian.

"Thus, the risk of disease transmission and the means of reducing that risk are well known. This common knowledge forms the basis of legal liability for both the private and governmental entities that operate animal exhibitions. While laws vary from state to state, the liability of these entities to those sickened through exposure to animals on site would be based in the premises of both liability and negligence.

"Under premises liability law, the entity or entities responsible for managing an animal exhibition have a duty of care to those it invites onto the premises. This duty includes the responsibility to adequately reduce risks the entity is or should be aware of. The duty also carries a responsibility to warn fairgoers of risks present at the exhibition."
