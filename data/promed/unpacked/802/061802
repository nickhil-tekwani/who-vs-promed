Vaccines exist for all 3 major pathogens causing bacterial meningitis, with
conjugated vaccines being available for some. The conjugated vaccines are
all effective in infants, children, and adults, with immunization starting
at 2 months of age:
_Streptococcus pneumoniae_: polysaccharides of 7 serotypes conjugated to
CRM197 protein (Prevnar);
_Haemophilus influenzae_ type b: PRP polysaccharide conjugated to either
tetanus toxoid, CRM 197, diphtheria toxoid, or meningococcal outermembrane
protein;
Serogroup C _Neisseria meningococcus_: serogroup C polysaccharide
conjugated to tetanus toxoid or CRM197 protein. [This conjugated vaccine is
not available in the USA. - Mod.LL]
Polysaccharide vaccines exist against pneumonoccus (23 serotypes) and
meningococcus (either bivalent A/C or tetravalent A/C/Y/W135).
Although group A meningococcal vaccines are effective in infants starting
at 2 months of age, the other polysaccharide vaccines are not sufficiently
immunogenic in infants less than 2 years of age.
Most recent outbreaks of meningococcal disease in Western Europe have been
associated with serogroup C meningococcus.
