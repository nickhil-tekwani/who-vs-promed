The health ministry in South Sudan's Jonglei state has reported an outbreak of kala-azar (visceral leishmaniasis, VL) in its remote Akobo and Nyirol counties.

"We have heard of the upsurge of the disease in Langkien where a big number of people are affected. Other cases were reported in Akobo, but our health team [has] not gained access to those locations," a doctor at Bor civil hospital told Sudan Tribune on Sunday [Sun 7 Sep 2014].

Kala-azar is a chronic and potentially fatal parasitic disease of the internal organs, particularly the liver, spleen, bone marrow, and lymph nodes transmitted by sandfly bites.

The disease is reportedly common in parts of Asia, Africa, and South America, and causes an estimated half million cases per year.

Jonglei's health minister, Angok Kuol confirmed the outbreak of the disease, saying medicines were dispatched to the 2 affected counties.

"Recently there were reports of increasing cases of kala-azar in Nyirol and Akobo counties. So we have sent in medicines, training materials and a consultant has even gone to help health personnel on the ground," said Kuol. Jonglei ministry of health now relies on its partners to deliver health services in the areas controlled by rebels fighting against government.

"We have allowed all our partners who are operating in the counties under rebels to continue delivering health services," said the minister.

For a review of the data on leishmaniasis in Sudan and South Sudan see the comments to the ProMED-mail posting from 16 Sep 2012 (Leishmaniasis, visceral - South Sudan (02): (UY) 20120916.1295988).

Leishmaniasis is highly endemic in Sudan and South Sudan and outbreaks occur regularly and unexpectedly in areas that were previously unaffected. A recent outbreak started at the end of 2009 with thousands of cases, possibly caused by massive population movements and growing food insecurity. This outbreak continued to cause extremely high case numbers in both 2010 and 2011 (Alvar J, Velez ID, Bern C, et al: Leishmaniasis worldwide and global estimates of its incidence. PLoS ONE 2012; 7(5): e35671. (Supplemet 81); http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0035671.

Malnutrition in the population probably contributes to the number of clinical cases of visceral leishmaniasis. An estimated 10 percent of VL cases in Southern Sudan is coinfected with HIV. - Mod.EP]
