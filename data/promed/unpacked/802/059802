Study shows 4th dose of Pfizer COVID vaccine wanes faster than 3rd
------------------------------------------------------------------
A study from Israel published today [24 May 2022] in BMJ shows that the effectiveness of a 4th dose of Pfizer-BioNTech's mRNA COVID vaccine waned faster than a 3rd dose in adults ages 60 and older.

The study took place over 10 weeks beginning in January 2022, and compared outcomes of 69 623 adults with 3 doses of Pfizer with 27 876 adults who received 4 doses. The study was conducted when omicron was the dominant strain in Israel.

During the 10 week follow-up period, 106 participants died, including 77 who had a 3rd dose and 23 with a 4th dose.

To gauge breakthrough infections, the authors performed a matched analysis that compared positive cases to controls by week since vaccination. The added relative vaccine effectiveness of a 4th dose against infection quickly decreased over time, peaking during the 3rd week at 65.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.0% to 67.1%) and falling to 22.0% (95% CI, 4.9% to 36.1%) by the end of the 10 week follow-up period, the authors said.

"This study has shown additional protection of the 4th dose against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 relative to 3 doses. However, the relative vaccine effectiveness against infection varied over time and waned sooner than that of the 3rd dose," the authors said. "By the 5th week after vaccination, relative effectiveness of the 4th dose against SARS-CoV-2 infection dropped back to levels similar to those observed during the 1st week."

Conclusions: A 4th dose of the BNT162b2 vaccine appears to have provided additional protection against both SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe COVID-19 disease relative to 3 vaccine doses. However, relative effectiveness of the 4th dose against infection appears to wane sooner than that of the 3rd dose.

Discussion. ...The difference between waning of protection against infection and sustained protection against severe disease could imply a different underlying immunological mechanism. A recent clinical study by Terreri et al. suggested that breakthrough infections could be explained by a decrease in the concentration of specific antibodies, which are probably not generated by a parenteral vaccine and are slow to reach nasopharyngeal mucosal sites of viral entry. By contrast, immunological memory (memory B and T cells) does not wane, and might be important for protection against severe disease. However, this hypothesis does not explain why a 3rd vaccine dose protects against severe disease compared with a 2nd one, and why a 4th improves the protection of a 3rd dose. A stabilisation effect of additional doses on immune memory should be further investigated, as well as studies on mucosal vaccines.]

Study: COVID-19 vaccine protection lower, wanes faster in cancer patients
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A UK study suggests that COVID-19 vaccination offers protection against infection, hospitalization, and death for most cancer patients but is less effective and wanes faster than in the general population.

In the study, published yesterday [23 May 2022] in The Lancet Oncology, a team led by University of Oxford researchers mined public data on English adults with and without cancer who had received 2 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine from 8 Dec 2020 to 15 Oct 2021, a period during which the delta variant became dominant.

Among the 377 194 patients with active or recent cancer, 42 882 (11.4%) tested positive for COVID-19, compared with 5 748 708 of 28 010 955 (20.5%) controls without cancer. Estimated initial vaccine effectiveness (VE) was 65.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.1% to 65.9%) among cancer patients and 69.8% (95% CI, 69.8% to 69.9%) among controls.

By 3-6 months, however, the difference in VE had widened, at 47.0% (95% CI, 46.3% to 47.6%) among cancer patients and 61.4% (95% CI, 61.4% to 61.5%) among controls. The COVID-19 vaccine offered more protection against hospitalization (83.3%) and death (93.4%) than against infection in cancer patients but also waned after 3 to 6 months.

Relative to controls, VE was much lower among patients with the blood cancers leukemia or lymphoma, a recent cancer diagnosis, or chemotherapy or radiotherapy within the past year.

"This highlights the importance of vaccination booster programmes and rapid access to COVID-19 treatments for people undergoing cancer treatments," senior author Peter Johnson, MD, of the University of Southampton, said in a University of Oxford news release.

In a related commentary, Nicole Kuderer, MD, of the Advanced Cancer Research Group, and Gary Lyman, MD, MPH, of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, both of Seattle, said the results illustrate the importance of prioritizing cancer patients for additional vaccine doses, treatments, and preventive therapies.

"In the meantime, high-quality face masks and physical distancing offer important protection against any strain of SARS-CoV-2," they wrote.

New York Times coronavirus briefing
-----------------------------------
Where deaths rose during the pandemic
--------------------------------------
Throughout the pandemic, the U.S. has had outsized access to lifesaving supplies like vaccines, antiviral treatments, face masks and testing kits. The country has also spent trillions of dollars in pandemic stimulus funds and enacted a raft of policies at the local and national level to combat the coronavirus.

And yet, despite its distinct advantage, the U.S. has had more deaths above normal levels during the pandemic than most other wealthy countries, according to data released by the World Health Organization this month [May 2022].

The W.H.O. found that, overall, U.S. deaths were 15% above normal -- a number surpassed by only 4 other large countries in the same income group: Chile, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania.

Deaths in the U.S. rose even higher than in several countries with far fewer resources, including Argentina and the Philippines.

Globally, some of the countries with the largest increase in death rates during the 1st 2 years of the pandemic were those in the upper- and middle-income groups, including Ecuador, Mexico and Peru, where inequality and graft thwarted their pandemic response.

Poor and developing countries generally fared worse than the wealthiest ones. But many of the lowest-income countries -- including most African countries -- were not included in the charts because their data is less reliable.

The excess mortality figures measured the difference between the number of people who died in 2020 and 2021 and the number of people who would have been expected to die during that time if the pandemic had not happened. These latest estimates by the W.H.O. are what many scientists say are the most reliable indication of the total impact of the pandemic so far, and they include deaths from other preventable illnesses when hospitals were overwhelmed with patients.

The W.H.O. figures also showed how much some countries struggled to count pandemic-related deaths accurately. India, for example, recorded 481 000 deaths in 2020 and 2021. The W.H.O. estimated that the country had 4.7 million excess deaths during the same period. India has rejected the W.H.O.'s findings.

The global toll -- around 15 million -- is more than twice the number of COVID-19 deaths reported in official government calculations, according to the health agency. Across the world, about 13% more people died in the 1st 2 years of the pandemic than what would've been expected in normal times.

How safe is the gym?
--------------------
A small, new study about respiration and exercise provides some rather startling answers.

The research, published on Monday [24 May 2022] in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences [see comment below], looked at the number of aerosol particles exhaled by 16 people at rest and during workouts. These tiny bits of airborne matter can transmit the coronavirus if someone is infected.

At rest, the participants breathed out about 500 particles per minute, the study found. But when they exercised, that total soared to more than 76 000 particles per minute, on average, during the most strenuous exertion. These findings help explain why several notable COVID superspreader events have occurred at indoor gym classes.

But these risks can be mitigated, my colleague Gretchen Reynolds reports. Ask your gym to open the windows and make sure its air-conditioning units draw air from outside to replace air filled with aerosol emissions. Maintain distance from others -- at least 8 to 10 feet [2.43 to 3.04 m] during strenuous workouts -- and wear an N95 mask, and check the rate of COVID cases in your community.

But keep moving. This study "is more incentive to ensure great ventilation and no crowding in gyms," said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech and an expert on airborne transmission of viruses. It's not a reason to skip workouts. "There are so many benefits to exercise," she added, "that I'll keep doing it in my well-ventilated, uncrowded gym."

What else we're following

"Our data have important implications for infection control during indoor group exercise. Previous studies have identified indoor group exercise as a situation where SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks can occur (9, 10, 29). Our data show that aerosol emission increases moderately up to ∼2 W/kg and exponentially at higher intensities (Fig. 4 and SI Appendix, Fig. S7). We therefore recommend for exercise up to an intensity of ∼2 W/kg to consider keeping a distance of > 1.5 m between exercisers, a high exchange or filtering rate of room air, and limited time spent in the exercise room (e.g., 45 to 90 min). As Buonanno et al. (30) proposed that the majority of outbreaks were caused by the combination of one superspreader in a small room with poor ventilation, we recommend additional measures to reduce the risk of infection during indoor group exercise above 2 W/kg when superemission occurs. This could include 15-min airing breaks in between classes, pre-exercise infection testing of participants, safety shields in between exercisers, mobile air filters (19, 31), and the wearing of masks even during exercise (26, 32-34)."

Superemission is a new and appropriate term for increased aerosol transmission while undertaking intense physical exertion, in the case of COVID above 2W/kg (watts per kilogram, or w/kg, is a basic power-to-weight ratio measurement. This data point reflects how many watts can you hold for a certain period of time, divided by your weight in kilograms). It is a particular risk in close quarters with poor ventilation and infected individual(s) who mix freely with others with little distance among them. It is common to see gyms wiping down equipment regularly, but it is even more important that they take the necessary measures to control aerosols generated by individuals exercising together. Otherwise, the potential is high to generate a superspreading event.

North Korea says no new fever deaths, claims COVID outbreak is under control
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
North Korea said on Tuesday [24 May 2022] there were no new deaths among fever patients in the country, the first time since it flagged a coronavirus outbreak nearly 2 weeks ago, adding that it was seeing a "stable" downward trend in pandemic-related cases.

The virus wave, which North Korea first declared on [12 May 2022], has fueled concerns over a lack of vaccines, inadequate medical infrastructure and a potential food crisis in the country of 25 million.

But the North said it was reporting "successes" in stemming the spread of the virus, and that there was no new fever death reported as of Monday evening [23 May 2022] despite adding 134 510 new patients.

It marked a 3rd consecutive day the daily figure stayed below 200 000 and the 1st time for the North to report no new deaths since announcing the number of daily fever patients, according to the official KCNA news agency.

Apparently deprived of testing supplies, North Korea has not confirmed the total number of people testing positive for the coronavirus, instead reporting the number with fever symptoms.

The total number of such cases, tallied since late April [2022], rose to 2.95 million, while the death toll stood at 68, according to KCNA.

"In a few days after the maximum emergency epidemic prevention system was activated, the nationwide morbidity and mortality rates have drastically decreased and the number of recovered persons increased, resulting in effectively curbing and controlling the spread of the pandemic disease and maintaining the clearly stable situation," KCNA said.

Many analysts, however, doubt the credibility of the figures, saying they only demonstrate how hard it is to assess the actual scale of the coronavirus wave in the isolated country.

[The communication from North Korea suggests that the number of cases is dropping, which is hopeful, even if not entirely accurate. Since testing is not being done and case count is determined by fever symptoms, the true number of infected individuals is likely much higher due to asymptomatic infections. - Mod.LK]
