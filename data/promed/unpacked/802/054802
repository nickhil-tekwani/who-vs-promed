Japan has decided to reimpose a ban on United States beef imports after
finding risk materials that could cause mad cow disease in a shipment from
New York, Kyodo news agency said on Friday. The decision comes just 1 month
after Japan lifted a 2 year ban on imports of US beef that was put in place
after the US found a case of mad cow disease in Washington state in
December 2003.
Japanese health and farm ministry officials could not immediately confirm
the report. A total of 390 kg (860 lb) of beef imported from a meatpacker
in New York was found to contain the risk materials when it was inspected
upon arrival at Narita International Airport near Tokyo, a Farm Ministry
official said earlier. "Under the agreement between the United States and
Japan, we decided to stop imports from the facility," the official said.
Japanese prime minister Junichiro Koizumi said the country's agriculture
minister had recommended reimposing the ban on all US beef imports. He also
recommended, "because preserving the food safety and security of the people
is extremely important, calling on the United States to make a strong
response," Koizumi told reporters.
Koizumi said he directed Agriculture Minister Shoichi Nakagawa to consult
with the health minister on the appropriate response. Japan officially
resumed some imports of beef from the United States and Canada [in December
2005].
The incident comes as US deputy secretary of state Robert Zoellick is due
to visit Japan on Sunday and Monday. Earlier, Nakagawa said a thorough
investigation was needed. "If this is true, it is extremely regrettable....
That is to say, we consider that it would be a serious violation of the
import process," Nakagawa told a news conference carried by national
broadcaster NHK.
Before the ban, Japan was the top importer of US beef, buying USD1.4
billion worth in 2003. After months of negotiations, Tokyo agreed in
December [to the importation of? - Mod.SH] cattle aged 20 months or
younger. It also said all risk material that could cause the brain-wasting
disease had to be totally removed. These materials include the spinal cord,
which was found in the cargo of US meat from New York.
Small quantities of beef from the US have started to enter Japan, but
consumers remain worried that food safeguards in the United States are not
up to Japanese standards. Experts believe humans can catch a variant
version of mad cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) [known in humans as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease], by eating contaminated meat.

Statement by agriculture secretary Mike Johanns regarding US beef eExports
to Japan: "We take this matter very seriously and we are conducting a
thorough investigation.
"I have talked with Ambassador Kato and I expressed our regret and informed
him of our actions. I also offered to provide in writing an outline of our
actions and the results of our investigation into this matter. Under US
regulations, the backbone, or vertebral column, that was exported to Japan
is not a specified risk material because it was in beef under 30 months [of
age]. However, our agreement with Japan is to export beef with no vertebral
column and we have failed to meet the terms of that agreement.
"The processing plant that exported this product has been de-listed and
therefore can no longer export beef to Japan. We will take the appropriate
personnel action against the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service
employee who conducted the inspection of the product in question and
approved it to be shipped to Japan.
"I am dispatching a team of USDA inspectors to Japan to work with Japanese
inspectors to reexamine every shipment currently awaiting approval, to
confirm compliance with the requirements of our export agreement with Japan.
"I have directed that additional USDA inspectors be sent to every plant
that is approved to export beef to review procedures and ensure compliance
with our export agreements, and I am requiring that 2 USDA inspectors
review every shipment of US beef for export to confirm that compliance. I
have also ordered unannounced inspections at every plant approved for beef
export.
"These additional inspection requirements in the US will be applied to all
processing plants approved for beef export and all beef shipments
designated for export from the U.S. I am also requiring that all USDA beef
inspectors undergo additional training to make certain they are fully aware
of all export agreement requirements. And, I have directed my staff to
coordinate a meeting of representatives from all US processing plants that
export beef to review those requirements.
"While this is not a food safety issue, this is an unacceptable failure on
our part to meet the requirements of our agreement with Japan. We take this
matter seriously, recognizing the importance of our beef export market, and
we are acting swiftly and firmly."

[It would appear that there is a misunderstanding between the Japanese and
the USDA regarding the maximum age for importing cattle. The Japanese
believe there is an agreement for cattle 20 months and younger, while the
USDA believes it is 30 months and younger. - Mod.TG]
