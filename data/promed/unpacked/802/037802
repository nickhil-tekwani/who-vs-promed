A total of one fatality has been linked to an _E. coli_ outbreak from romaine lettuce that has been detected in 5 provinces. The Public Health Agency of Canada said in a statement [Thu 14 Dec 2017] night, that a total of 30 cases of _E. coli_ O157 are being investigated and one person has died. The statement did not say where the death occurred or give any other details.

The agency says 6 cases have been reported in Ontario, 5 in Quebec and New Brunswick, one in Nova Scotia and 13 in Newfoundland and Labrador. [This does not add up to 30 - Mod.LL] Those who became ill range between the ages of 4 and 80 and 70 per cent of those who became sick are female.

Public health officials say many of those who became sick say they ate romaine lettuce before their illnesses occurred. They say they are still trying to track down the source of the lettuce. Symptoms of this strain of _E. coli_ infection include nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, severe stomach cramps and watery or bloody stool. Most people recover in a few days but some can develop life-threatening illnesses that can cause death.

[Although the total does not add up to 30, the original report cited 21 cases from 3 provinces.

Most serotypes of _E. coli_, when confined to their usual habitat in the gastrointestinal tract, are harmless and indeed have beneficial properties to their human "host" including detoxifying substances and preventing the overgrowth of more harmful bacteria. Some strains, however, "enteropaths", have evolved to produce toxins and can cause diarrheal illnesses including travelers' diarrhea. One of these groupings is the enterohemorrhagic _E. coli_ (EHEC) also called Shiga toxin producing _E. coli_ (STEC). It is this group with the prototypic serotype O157:H7 discussed in this post. Most of the time, however, when water boiling notices are posted because of high levels of _E. coli_ in a water supply, it is not EHEC per se being testing for but rather the _E. coli_, sometimes referred to as "coliforms" are used to test for sewage contamination of water.

The classical vehicle for EHEC is undercooked ground beef but salad ingredients such as lettuce, tomato, bean sprouts, and spinach can serve as a transmitter from contamination of the produce at any point from while growing in the field to harvesting to the restaurant or home kitchen. These organisms are found in a variety of animals, primarily cattle. While the advise in the posting is important, several enteric pathogens including EHEC can actually internalize into the produce and replicate there so washing will not always be successful in removing the contamination. The following publication is a recent one investigating this phenomenon:

Wright KM, Crozier L, Marshall J, et al. Differences in internalization and growth of _Escherichia coli_ O157:H7 within the apoplast of edible plants, spinach and lettuce, compared with the model species _Nicotiana benthamiana_. Microb Biotechnol. 2017; 10: 555-69; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5404196/

Abstract
--------
Internalization of food-borne bacteria into edible parts of fresh produce plants represents a serious health risk. Therefore, internalization of verocytotoxigenic _E. coli_ O157:H7 isolate Sakai was assessed in 2 species associated with outbreaks, spinach (_Spinacia oleracea_) and lettuce (_Lactuca sativa_) and compared to the model species _Nicotiana benthamiana_. Internalization occurred in the leaves and roots of spinach and lettuce throughout a 10 day time-course. The plant species, tissue type and inoculum dose all impacted the outcome. A combination of low inoculum dose (about 100 CFU [colony-forming unit]) together with light microscopy imaging highlighted marked differences in the fate of endophytic _E. coli_ O157:H7 Sakai. In the fresh produce species, bacterial growth was restricted but viable cells persisted over 20 days, whereas there was more than 400-fold (about 2.5 Log10 ) increase in growth in _N. benthamiana_. Colony formation occurred adjacent to epidermal cells and mesophyll cells or close to vascular bundles of _N. benthamiana_ and contained components of a biofilm matrix, including curli expression and elicitation, extracellular DNA, and a limited presence of cellulose. Together the data show that internalization is a relevant issue in crop production and that crop species and tissue need to be considered as food safety risk parameters.
