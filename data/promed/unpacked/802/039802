Autopsies of three who died of pneumonia following kidney transplant
surgery at a leading Prague hospital
have yielded evidence of _Legionella_ bacteria. The deaths occurred during
the first half of June, 1998. A subsequent investigation found the
organism in the hot water pipes of the hospital. Heating the water to 80
degrees C eliminated the bacteria in the pipes, but the hospital suspended
all surgery pending resolution of the situation.
The report indicated that Czech hospitals do not routinely check for
_Legionella_.
