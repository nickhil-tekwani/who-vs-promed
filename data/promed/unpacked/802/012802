A tragic but interesting episode. I have seen several captive giraffes die of
clostridium-related infections following cutaneous or muscle bruising in
holding facilities. We have identified _C. chauvoei_ and _C. septicum_ by
fluorescent antibody techniques in 2 of these cases. These carcasses also
appear to undergo accelerated putrefaction. Could this be a clostridium-
related bacterial toxicosis? Food for thought.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Bengis for his comments.
_C. chauvoei_ causes blackleg, an acute febrile disease of cattle and sheep
characterized by emphysematous swelling, usually in the larger muscles. _C.
chauvoei_ occurs naturally in the intestinal tract of animals; contaminated
pasture appears to be a source of the organisms, which can remain viable in
the soil for many years.
Acute toxin-related processes in humans related to _Clostridium sp._ are
generally caused by in vivo replication of bacteria with subsequent production
of a toxin. Only classical botulism is generally caused by the ingestion of
pre-formed toxin, with infant-associated and wound botulism due to in situ
production of toxin, as is the case with tetanus. Additionally, in
clostridial food poisoning, a toxin-related disease, it is also felt that
toxin is elaborated in the intestinal tract rather than being ingested
preformed. In clostridial gas gangrene, both bacterial replication and toxin
production appear to be pathogenic, rather than just an intoxication per se.
It is possible, however, that the unfortunate young girl ingested a much
larger amount of toxin in the giraffe meat than the others and, based on her
smaller size, suffered more rapid and severe illness. This has been described
rarely with another enteric intoxication, _Bacillus cereus_ emetic toxin
disease. An example of death related to this usually nonfatal disease was
recently published (1). This case report along with a previous case (2)
illustrate that large toxin loads may cause quite severe, less frequent
manifestations of toxin illness such as pulmonary hemorrhage and liver
failure.��
_C. perfringens_ epsilon toxin is listed as a category B bioterrorism agent.
It causes a rapidly lethal, acute toxemia primarily in sheep but also in other
herbivores such as goats and cattle. Eating habits appear to be particularly
relevant, as a diet containing protein and energy-rich foods, [used for] fast-
growing young animals, is associated with increased susceptibility.
The "overeating" disease may be caused by undigested, starch-laden food
reaching the intestines, where _C. perfringens_ spores more easily germinate
and produce the prototoxin.
The toxin-produced increase in intestinal leakage with enteritis produces
toxemia, causing pulmonary edema, pericardial effusions and swollen hyperemic
kidneys ("pulpy kidney disease") (3). Central nervous system disease is
reflected by nervousness in sheep and less commonly as seizures or loss of
consciousness. Cattle and older sheep are more likely to demonstrate
neurological signs, and goats manifest more diarrhea.�
Although large doses of toxin in sheep result in a severe diffuse brain edema
with a rapid progression to death, with lower toxin doses or in a partially
immune host, more focal lesions with necrosis occur with a slower progression
to death (4). In calves and adult goats, subacute nonfatal cases occur.
Intravenous injection of epsilon toxin in calves produces histopathological
changes similar to those seen in sheep and goats after enteric exposure,
including acute pulmonary edema and cerebral edema (5).
Published studies are not readily available on human disease related to
exposure to epsilon toxin as it might be used in biological warfare.
Delivered as an aerosol in adequate doses, the toxin is thought to be capable
of causing initial pulmonary edema [fluid in the lungs] with the possibility
of secondary kidney, cardiac, and nervous system damage (3). Although not
specifically listed as an agent of biological warfare, _C. perfringens_ alpha
toxin, a potent phospholipase, when aerosolized causes severe, lethal
pulmonary disease in animals due to a pulmonary capillary leak resulting in
ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome]. Absorbed toxin could lead to
intravascular hemolysis [breakdown of red blood cells], thrombocytopenia [low
platelet count leading to slower blood clotting], and liver damage.
