There have been 58 cases of sylvan YF, including 6
fatal, in the Central region of Minas Gerais State,
mostly in the township of Serro, 326 km from the
state capital, Belo Horizonte; 6000 people have been
vaccinated in Serro and in 35 neighboring townships.
In rural areas vaccination has been done house-to-
house, especially in the community of Lucas, which
is the most affected. Two more suspect fatal cases
await confirmation.

The regions at highest risk are the on the banks of
the Rio Ganhaes, which divides the townships of
Sabinopolis, Serro & Alvorada de Minas.

[This is an increase of 34 cases and one death plus 2
more suspected deaths in one week since the WHO
report of 17 Jan 2003 -- see ref. (02) below. There is
as yet no report of urbanization of the epidemic, but
this remains a risk. Travelers to all affected & at risk
areas in Brazil & elsewhere should be vaccinated. -
