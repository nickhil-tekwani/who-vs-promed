Tasting the salty hints of summer coming through, JS just had a few more days left of school before classes no longer disrupted her riding schedule. The 11 year old had big plans for her 2 ponies, Land's End Lady Slipper and Sparkle, that included the Vermont Summer Festival, Lake Placid (New York) and the USEF Pony Finals (Kentucky). [After school on] Mon 20 May [2019] she found her way to CK and CK's farm.

On Tue 21 May [2019], JS came home from a field trip with a headache and a fever. Her mom SS took her to the pediatrician, who said it was just a bug. But by Sun 26 May [2019], SS saw her worst nightmare realized as JS's fever spiked to extreme levels, causing her to suddenly start having seizures. She was immediately admitted to the Boston Children's Hospital ICU with swelling in her brain and spine.

"Before this, completely healthy, rode 6 days a week at her barn. Nothing, just completely out of nowhere," said SS. "Monday [20 May 2019] the day before, she was riding her horses. A week later, she was in the ICU with tubes coming out of every bit of her and in a coma. And they had no idea what it was," she continued. "They did like a spinal tap and sent off that spinal fluid to University of California, San Francisco, and it screens about 1000 different types of viruses and diseases that it could be. So, it takes 2 weeks to get those results."

While waiting for the results, the doctors put JS in a medically induced coma for 3 days as they fed her body every antibiotic and steroid they could to rid her of the unknown virus and reduce the swelling in her brain. When her body started to respond, they took her off the monitor, but she didn't open her eyes for another 2 days.

"They took it all off, and you kind of just sit there and wait," said SS. "And it's excoriating that waiting period because you expect them to just open up their eyes and say 'Where am I? What's going on?' and talk. And it took her probably 2.5-3 days to open up her eyes. She couldn't talk. She couldn't breathe on her own. And then eventually she just became a little bit more aware over time what was going on. And as parents, we were kind of advocating, 'Take the breathing tube out so that she could try; she's a little kid, she's afraid,'"

The results from California showed that JS suffered from a rare tickborne virus called Powassan. 1st discovered in Russia, the virus has slowly made its way to the United States, 1st in the Great Lakes region and now in the north east [This is incorrect. The virus was 1st discovered in Ontario, Canada and later found to be endemic there, in the north eastern USA, and later in Wisconsin. - Mod.TY]. The younger the patient is, the better chances of recovery since there is no treatment for the virus. The antibiotics the doctors gave JS in Boston allowed it to work itself out of her body. But the answer didn't necessarily solve all problems. "She was at Children's for 2 weeks and lost her ability to walk, talk, swallow," said SS. "Her right side had swelling, like the nerve endings from her spine had swelling that affected her right side of her body. So, her arm was pretty dead, like no use out of it. And she was a righty."

After the hospital, JS then went to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital (Boston) for 2 weeks, where they worked to help her regain her speech and motor abilities. "My husband and I went to visit her, and at that point, she was still unable to speak and had no use of the right side of her body," said SS. "This was in late June 2019, not that long ago." But as soon as JS regained her voice, she had one thing on her mind to say. "All she cared about, from the minute she was able to form words, the one thing she remembered was that she'd qualified Sparkle and Lady Slipper for Pony Finals," said CK. "She said, 'I want to go ride my pony.' That was it."

"The whole time all she's talking about is when she's going to ride again, and her ponies, it was heartbreaking," said SS. "And during that time, we were supposed to go to Vermont to horse show as well as Lake Placid, and we had to call those off. So she was very determined that she'd still go to Pony Finals." With a specific goal in mind, JS blew doctors away with her fast recovery. She left Spaulding on 1 Jul 2019. And a week later, she was able to be ponied around at a walk.

"She would walk around, and we would help her and walk next to her, one of the girls in the barn or her sister," said CK. "Everyone really rallied together. We have a really close group of kids and juniors at our barn, so everybody pitched in. She's a very quiet kid to begin with. She's not gregarious. She's very quiet and reserved. She would just quietly come to the barn and brush her pony and walk around on her pony."

"I think it came more naturally to her. She didn't think anything of it," said SS. "It was just who she is, and for the rest of us watching from the tack room, we're crying. The barn is her happy place and it's just you go to school, you go to the barn for 2 hours a day, you come home and have dinner. It's just her way of life. She's a quiet child by nature and not very boisterous or anything. I think internally she was just really happy."

After a week of walking, the neurology team gave her a stamp of approval to continue on doing whatever she was doing before. "She was lucky, she was so strong from riding horses going into that; her body was pretty strong," said SS. "She kind of picked up right where she left off. It was amazing."

"My husband, who is far more willing to take a chance than I am, was like, 'OK, let's do this,'" said CK. "They started slowly doing some flat lessons. This was over a very short period of time. Pony Finals was weeks away. They started jumping some small courses, then we did week 5 at [HITS-on-the-Hudson]. She went in and did the pony division, and she did great."

JS won her 1st class back in action in Saugerties, New York, the USEF Pony Medal, with "Lady," proving she was ready to trek to Lexington, Kentucky to compete in the small pony division. While a small mistake in the under saddle put her in the middle of the pack, JS and Lady jumped a stellar over fences in the Walnut Ring. If there was ever a moment on course when things could go awry, Lady took charge, taking care of her person. "This pony would jump through fire for her," said CK. "She's the kind of pony who's like, 'OK we're going to move up here kid, we need to make this line work.' JS knew the pony had given 110 percent to her. It was really wonderful."

And coming out of the ring after completing the course, quiet JS threw her arms around Lady in appreciation. "First of all, I want to say to Lady that I really do love her," said JS. "It was like a dream come true."

"I don't like to throw around the word miracle, but it was about as close; 6 weeks previous, doctors weren't sure if she'd ever be able to walk again," said CK. "I have clients who are doctors, and they were like, 'There's no way she can go to Pony Finals,' and boy she proved all of us wrong."

[This report puts a human face on a successful outcome that could have been a case with a tragic ending. Powassan (POWV) infections can be fatal or leave recovered individuals with neurological sequelae.

Although ProMED-mail has not posted cases of POW virus infections in Massachusetts in recent years, cases have been reported in surrounding states, especially in New York. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports 22 cases in Massachusetts in the past. The black-legged tick, _Ixodes scapularis_ was likely the POW virus vector in this case. This tick is relatively small and can easily be overlooked when feeding on a person. Avoidance of tick bites is the only preventive measure available, since there is no vaccine for it.

Additional information on POW virus is available on the USA CDC web site at https://www.cdc.gov/powassan/. - Mod.TY
