LIVESTOCK FATALITIES, UNDIAGNOSED - ETHIOPIA

An outbreak of unidentified disease affecting sheep, goats, camels, and to a
lesser extent, cattle in four districts of Ethiopia has just been reported.
[Ethiopia is a member of Office International des Epizooties but has not yet
reported the outbreak to the animal health organization, most likely because
it has not been identified as one of the notifiable diseases. -DP]
The outbreak began last month, according to an official of the Social and
Economic Department, in Dulecha, Walkuba, Mara, and Awash Bentale (all names
phonetic). An official with the Dulecha District Council said that at least
30 sheep and 15 camels were dying each day. The delivery of medicine has
been prevented by transport problems.
