Herpesvirus 8 can be transmitted through needle sharing
-------------------------------------------------------
BUENOS AIRES: Needle sharing can result in transmission of human
herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), which is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and
pleural effusion lymphomas, Argentinian and American scientists report in
the current issue of Medicina [Medicina 2001; 61: 291-4. It remains to be
seen if blood exchange is even more prevalent than sexual contact as a
route of transmission, they note. "It appears that HHV-8 can be rather
easily passed through sexual contacts. But blood transfusions or repetitive
exposure to contaminated needles, despite less efficiency, might also
transmit the virus," Dr. Jorge Benetucci, president of the Fundacion de
Ayuda al Inmunodeficiente (FUNDAI), in Buenos Aires, told Reuters Health.
Dr Benetucci and colleagues examined stored serum specimens from 223
individuals (96 per cent men) who had attended clinics at FUNDAI between
1994 and 1997 for the purpose of receiving free HIV testing as well as
counseling. Their median age was 28 years; most were heterosexual, and of
low socioeconomic status. The team compared the proportion of HHV-8
infected people in 2 groups: 153 intravenous drug users (over 90 per cent
of whom were HIV infected) and 70 HIV-negative, heterosexual non-drug
users. "Interestingly, the rate of HHV-8 infection in HIV positive
intravenous drug users was almost 3 times as high when compared to the
HIV-negative individuals, suggesting that intravenous drug usage is a risk
factor for HHV-8 infection," the researchers report.
In the United States, about 70 per cent of HIV infected patients are also
infected with HHV-8, but herpes virus detection is not a routine test, the
authors note. Lead author Dr Charles Wood, director of the Nebraska Center
for Virology of the University of Nebraska, told Reuters Health that: "It
would be good for those [who are HHV-8 negative to know that they are
unlikely to develop Kaposi's [sarcoma, and should try to prevent
[themselves from getting infected" with HHV-8".
