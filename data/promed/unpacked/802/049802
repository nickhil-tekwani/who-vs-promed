Foot & mouth disease, imported horse quarantine (USA) 20010401.0661

[In PRO/AH> Foot & mouth disease, imported horse quarantine (USA), the
moderator commented that "Human beings can carry the FMD virus for 5 days
in the nasal passages. It would stand to reason horses may also." - Mod.TG
In view of the international concern with regard to the international
spread of FMD, it may be useful to revisit the evidence related to the
possibility of man spreading the virus via the nasal passage.
In his excellent review of the epidemiology of FMD, Sanson (1994) noted
that "humans exposed to infected animals can expel FMDV through coughing,
sneezing, talking, and breathing for periods of up to 28 hours." The
reference cited in support of the above statement was Sellers et al.
(1970), which related to experiments carried out at the Animal Virus
research Institute in Pirbright. A re-examination of Sellers et al. (1970)
reveals the following points:
a) The titre of virus recovered in nasal swabs was highest in persons
actually examining the head area of clinically affected pigs (as opposed to
people operating air samplers or people examining other animal species, or
people examining the feet of infected pigs). Virus was recovered on many
occasions from people's coughs, sneezes, and when talking and breathing.
The mode of contamination was assumed to be by inhaling the air that was
exhaled by the pigs.
b) The amounts recovered from individuals varied on the order of 3 to 40 times.
c) As long as people stayed in the vicinity of infected animals, the
concentration of virus in the nasal passages did not vary greatly,
indicating that there was no replication in the nose of humans. Swabs were
also taken over a period after they had left the infected animals (meaning
the people had showered and had had 2 changes of clothing). On average
there was a fall in titre of 1.8 logs over 3.5 hours. In the case of one
person, virus was recovered 28 hours after exposure, but none was recovered
at 48 hours.
d) The effect of nose-blowing was minimal. A single nose blow resulted in a
reduction of 0.5 log units, but virus was detectable after 10 nose blows.
e) Wearing a surgical mask reduced the amount of virus inhaled by 0.9 or
0.8 log units, but paper masks had no effect.
f) To examine the risk that people's noses pose, 4 attempts were made to
transmit the FMD virus to other humans. On each of the 4 attempts, 3 people
examined infected pigs and then walked to the other end of the isolation
unit and talked to colleagues for 2 minutes. On one of the 4 attempts,
virus was recovered from the nose of a recipient after 4 minutes, while on
the other 3 times nothing happened.
Further information appeared in a letter to the editor of the Vet Record on
16 October 1971 (Sellers et al., 1971), which described experiments to see
if humans could transmit infection to animals:
(a) pigs were infected with FMD virus (types O or C)
(b) when they had clinical signs the animals were examined by 4 examiners
(c) swabs were taken of the examiners' noses
(d) the examiners then left the infected area (after disinfection, shower
out, change of clothes)
(e) the examiners then went into a separate isolation area (putting on a
new set of clothing)
(f) they then spent 30 seconds "sneezing, snorting, coughing and breathing"
into the mouths of 2 susceptible steers each (after 30 seconds "these
activities caused discomfort to the examiners"). Swabs were taken of the
examiners' noses again.
(g) one of the 4 steers became infected and showed lesions on the 14th day
after exposure (this was the one that was first exposed to the snorting
humans on each occasion).
(h) note that the interval between examining the pigs and examining the
cattle was from a minimum of 15 to a maximum of 20 minutes.
Conclusion:
These experiments from Pirbright, carried out 30 years ago, indicate that
it is possible for people examining the head area of clinically affected
pigs to harbor the FMD virus in their nasal cavity, but the duration of
such carriage is less than 2 days. [Not 5 days as indicated by the
moderator. Infection can be transmitted by snorting and coughing into the
noses of steers shortly afterward (less than half an hour).
Presumably this is, at least in part, where the concept of the stand-down
period comes from, but how it came to be set at 7 days (commonly used for
disease control personnel) is not clear. The 7 days probably is
conservative, but it may be appropriate for people actually examining
infected pigs. For people that have been involved with sheep and cattle
presumably the risk is less. However, the value of noseblowing is probably
limited.
But for horses to be of importance in the same way as humans, one would
have to have horses housed together with infected pigs. They would then
have to get to the USA and come into contact with susceptible ruminants
within 2 days. One would have to question the likelihood of any of this.

[I appreciate Howard setting me straight. Also, it appears 5 days is the
safety factor publicly recommended by the USA government. Thanks Howard. -
