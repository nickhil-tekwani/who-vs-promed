CDC is collaborating with public health officials in several states and the FDA to investigate a multistate outbreak of _Salmonella [enterica_ serotype] Typhimurium infections. Joint investigation efforts indicate that cantaloupe grown in southwestern Indiana is a likely source of this outbreak. As a result of the initial investigations by the state health departments in Indiana and Kentucky, a farm in southwestern Indiana has contacted its distributors, which reach outside Indiana into other states, and is withdrawing its cantaloupe from the market place. The farm has agreed to cease distributing cantaloupes for the rest of the growing season.

Public health investigators are using DNA "fingerprints" of _Salmonella_ bacteria obtained through diagnostic testing with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, or PFGE, to identify cases of illness that may be part of this outbreak. They are using data from PulseNet, the national subtyping network made up of state and local public health laboratories and federal food regulatory laboratories that performs molecular surveillance of foodborne infections.

A total of 141 persons infected with the outbreak strain of _S._ Typhimurium have been reported from 20 states. The number of ill people identified in each state is as follows: Alabama (7), Arkansas (3), California (2), Georgia (1), Illinois (17), Indiana (13), Iowa (7), Kentucky (50), Michigan (6), Minnesota (3), Missouri (9), Mississippi (2), New Jersey (1), North Carolina (3), Ohio (3), Pennsylvania (2), South Carolina (3), Tennessee (6), Texas (1), and Wisconsin (2).

Among persons for whom information is available, illness onset dates range from 7 Jul 2012 to 4 Aug 2012. Ill persons range in age from less than 1 to 92 years, with a median age of 49 years old. 55 percent of ill persons are female. Among 64 persons with available information, 31 (48 percent) patients reported being hospitalized. 2 deaths have been reported in Kentucky.

Investigation of the outbreak
-----------------------------
Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback investigations conducted by officials in local, state, and federal public health, agriculture, and regulatory agencies indicate that cantaloupes grown in southwestern Indiana are a likely source of this outbreak of _S._ Typhimurium infections. Investigations are ongoing to identify the source of contaminated cantaloupes. In interviews, ill persons answered questions about foods consumed and other exposures during the week before becoming ill. 18 (75 percent) of 24 ill persons interviewed reported consuming cantaloupe in the week before their illness began. The Kentucky Division of Laboratory Services has isolated the outbreak strain from two cantaloupes collected from a retail location in Kentucky.

Preliminary results of antibiotic susceptibility testing indicate that this strain is susceptible to commonly prescribed antibiotics. There is no connection between this salmonellosis outbreak and the 2011 multistate outbreak of listeriosis linked to whole cantaloupes from Jensen Farms, Colorado.

CDC and state and local public health partners are continuing laboratory surveillance through PulseNet to identify additional ill persons and to interview ill persons about foods eaten before becoming ill. Investigations are ongoing to determine if other types of melons may be linked to illness. FDA is continuing to work closely with CDC and state partners during this investigation. CDC will update the public on the progress of this investigation as information becomes available.
