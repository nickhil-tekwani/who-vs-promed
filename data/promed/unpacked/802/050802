Description of affected population: all infected pigs are in backyard farms.
Diagnosis:
*Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Sichuan Province General
Station of Animal Epidemics Prevention and Surveillance, Sichuan
Diagnostic tests used: isolation and culture of bacterium
Date: ...
Results: positive
*Laboratories where diagnosis was made Foreign Animal Disease
Diagnosis Centre, National Animal Quarantine Institute, Qingdao
Diagnostic tests used: microscopy
Date: ...
Results: positive
Diagnostic tests used: fluorescent antibody test
Date: ...
Results: positive
*Laboratories where diagnosis was made: Harbin Veterinary Research
Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin
Diagnostic tests used: PCR(1)
Date: 25 Jul 2005
Results: positive
Diagnostic tests used: sequencing
Date: ...
Results: the pathogen, _Streptococcus suis_ B, shares 98 percent
nucleotide homology with the CPS2 gene of the AF118389 strain of the
GenBank databank
Note: The Foreign Animal Disease Diagnosis Centre and the Harbin
Veterinary Research Institute carried out a differential diagnosis.
Using RT-PCR(2) with type A influenza virus as positive control and
RT-PCR(2) for Nipah virus, the results were negative. The results of
pathogen isolation by SPF egg inoculation and pathogen isolation on
VERO cell line, after 2 passages, were also negative. Avian influenza
and Nipah disease were, therefore, excluded.
Source of outbreaks or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive.
Control measures
A. Undertaken:
- Stamping out.
- Quarantine (lifting of quarantine: 14 days after the last pig was culled).
- Movement control inside the country.
- Screening.
- Zoning. Premises with infected pigs or relevant slaughterhouses and
other facilities are considered as infected points; areas within a
one km radius are considered as infected zones; areas within 3 km
around the infected zones are considered as buffer zones.
- Disinfection of infected premises/establishments.
- Dipping/spraying.
- Sichuan province has organized a general survey for 51 880 300 live
pigs (87.92 percent of the pig population in the province).
B. To be undertaken: vaccination. An inactivated _Streptococcus suis_
vaccine is being tested in the field. All pigs in the infected zones
and buffer zones will be vaccinated if the experiment is successful.
Treatment of affected animals: no.
(1) PCR: polymerase chain reaction
(2) RT-PCR: reverse transcriptase - polymerase chain reaction

[It is most helpful to have these complete laboratory results and
some recent epidemiological information. We look forward to similar
reports in the near future, as there is much to be learned from this
outbreak. - Mod.PC]
[In the report, the number of susceptible animals is identical to the number
of destroyed animals. Dead animals should not be counted within the
destroyed animals. - Mod.AS]
