The Nebraska Department of Agriculture (NDA) in conjunction with the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) has confirmed preliminary testing shows the presence of a 3rd case of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza (HPAI) in Dixon County. The 3rd farm (referred to as Dixon 3) is within a mile of the initial farm (referred to as Dixon 1) identified last week and is owned by the same operator.

Dixon 3 is a flock of 500 000 pullets (young hens). Dixon 1 and Dixon 2, announced last week, collectively have 3.5 million laying hens.

"These farms are in close proximity to each other, so this finding, while unfortunate, is not unexpected," said NDA Director Greg Ibach. "We continue to receive great support from our federal, state and local partners, as well as from the operator, as we work to control the spread of the virus."

All 3 sites are under quarantine, a perimeter has been established around each facility, and the birds are being depopulated. Under the USDA protocol, NDA is visiting all locations that have poultry within a 6.2-mile radius of Dixon 3 to conduct testing. Due to the proximity of Dixon 3 to the other facilities, the 6.2-mile radius overlaps significantly.

The preliminary positive test at Dixon 3 is expected to be confirmed by officials at a federal laboratory sometime over the holiday weekend, but Ibach said response teams in Dixon County already are working at Dixon 3 to address the HPAI finding.

Gov. Pete Ricketts last week issued a state emergency declaration to provide NDA and other state agencies with appropriate resources to address the HPAI situation.

The Centers for Disease Control considers the risk to people from HPAI H5 infections to be low. Proper handling and cooking of poultry and eggs to an internal temperature of 165 degrees kills the virus. Dixon 1 and 2 are egg-laying facilities and therefore the chickens are not consumed, and the eggs from these facilities are processed and go through pasteurization, eliminating product consumption risk.

Ibach is asking Nebraska poultry producers, large and small, to follow strict biosecurity measures on their farms and to monitor their flocks for symptoms of the virus and notify NDA immediately if they suspect any problems. All bird owners, whether commercial producers or backyard enthusiasts, should prevent contact between their birds and wild birds, and report sick birds or unusual bird deaths to state/federal officials, either through NDA by calling 1-877-800-4080 or through USDA's toll-free number at 1-866-536-7593.

As part of the existing USDA avian influenza response plans, federal and state partners as well as industry are following these 5 basic steps: 1) Quarantine - restricting movement of poultry and poultry-moving equipment into and out of the control area; 2) Eradicate - humanely euthanizing the affected flock(s); 3) Monitor region - testing wild and domestic birds in a broad area around the quarantine area; 4) Disinfect - kills the virus in the affected flock locations; and 5) Test - confirming that the poultry farm is AI virus-free.

Additional information on HPAI can be found online at <www.nda.nebraska.gov>. Information is available for producers, media and the general public.

After more than a week of no bird flu incidents, 6 new outbreaks at Minnesota turkey farms were disclosed Tuesday [26 May 2015] by animal health regulators.

The 6 cases bring the number of stricken farms to 94 since the bird flu surfaced in Minnesota in early March 2015, devastating commercial turkey flocks and a few large chicken-egg operations. More than 8 million birds have died, not including most of the 6 farms announced Tuesday.

Until Tuesday, the state hadn't announced a new outbreak since 15 May 1015, said Bethany Hahn, spokeswoman for the Minnesota Animal Health Board. That was the longest period between cases since early to mid-March, just before a tide of outbreaks swept the poultry industry.

Animal scientists have been hoping the flu would slow down and die out -- at least for the summer -- as the weather got warmer.

"The virus is still around," Hahn said. "We were guardedly optimistic, but we will see what will happen."

3 of the outbreaks announced were in central Minnesota's Kandiyohi County, bringing the total there to 36, the most of any of the 22 Minnesota counties struck by the lethal H5N2 avian flu. Kandiyohi is the largest turkey-producing county in the nation's biggest turkey-producing state.

2 more outbreaks were reported in Renville County, bringing the total there to 4. Brown County reported its 1st outbreak, which involved 46 800 turkeys.

Minnesota raises about 46 million turkeys annually, and the flu has wiped out about 10 percent of production.

[The 3rd farm in Nebraska may not be unexpected, but one cannot help but wonder since the farms are all owned/operated by the same entity if this is a case of cross-contamination between premises. While the virus may be carried by the wind, it may be as likely to be carried by workers or feed trucks or trucks removing bird waste, or a visitor.

Minnesota brings sad news that the virus seems to have returned. The dormancy of the virus for a few weeks was certainly welcomed, and hopefully this virus will die out in all the affected states. One has to wonder where this many cases originated in such a short time. Were they already incubating, or did this virus get tracked in by individuals or blown in by the wind?
