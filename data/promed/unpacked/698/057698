Massive duck die-off
-----------------------
Another duck die-off hit the waters of Clear Lake this weekend,
claiming 1145 waterfowl as of 4pm. Experts are tentatively saying
avian cholera is the culprit this time, pending lab confirmation.
Avian cholera affects birds so quickly that they have been known to
sometimes literally drop out of the sky or die while swimming,
according to the National Wildlife Health Center. Approximately 40
percent of the affected birds die; those who don't become carriers.
Although all waterfowl are susceptible, the ruddy duck [_Oxyura
jamaicensis_] is Clear Lake's most common carrier [of what may
potentially be avian cholera]. Approximately 3000 ruddy ducks winter
on Clear Lake, he added, which can easily turn into more than 10 000
in a matter of days.
Almost 230 dead ducks were picked up this weekend by the Department
of Fish & Game, with some help from local residents. The birds, all
ruddy ducks, washed up on the shoreline stretching along Highway 20
between Nice and Lucerne.
Crews on 2 air boats and a lead biologist from the North Central
Region of the Department of Fish & Game arrived Mon 22 Jan 2007
afternoon to find about 350 more between Nice and Lucerne and 600 in
Paradise Cove. Officials said most of them were ruddy ducks; a few
mallards and gulls were also found dead.
Lake County Fish & Game Warden Lynette Shimek said she and the crews
expect to work "however long it takes to get the birds cleaned up,"
possibly stretching into days.
Shimek added Mon 22 Jan 2007 night that anyone who finds dead
waterfowl along the shoreline should not touch them or attempt to
pick them up, but call DFG. Shimek can be reached at 275-8862. "The
birds have not been tested yet," said Shimek Monday morning. "So
although this looks like cholera, we can't be guaranteed that that's
what it is until they are tested."
So far 5 samples are ready to go to DFG's Wildlife Investigations Lab
in Rancho Cordova, according to Associate Wildlife Biologist Paul
Hofmann of the North Central Region of the Department of Fish & Game.
There, they will be necropsied and tested for a variety of diseases.
According to an 11 Jan 2007 DFG press release about an avian cholera
outbreak in Butte Sink less than 100 miles east of Lake County, avian
cholera die-offs usually happen during the winter months in
California, especially during cold spells and fog.
Hofmann said outbreaks are usually ending about this time of year and
termed this outbreak "unusual." If avian cholera is to blame for the
die-off, he said, it may have been aggravated by the recent cold snap.
"Stress and crowding is bad for people and birds," said Hofmann.
"It's the same as with humans ... your resistance is low under stress."
As with any bird disease, said Hofmann, avian cholera is spread when
birds concentrate in one area. He added that they tend to fly less
and congregate more under stressful conditions.
The virus spreads through mucus when the birds are in close proximity
to each other by sneezing, shaking their heads, grooming and pecking
each other, and even through a spray emitted through their nostrils
when they take off for flight, said Knight. "You don't stop this,"
said Knight. "It runs its course, and then the birds leave," he said.
Hofmann noted that recent sunny skies and wavy conditions on the lake
from high winds tend to break up mucus on the water surface, making
for bad conditions for the spread of avian cholera. He further noted
that the ruddy ducks will be heading north again in a couple of weeks.
Lake County saw close to 8000 waterfowl die during an outbreak of
avian cholera in January 2004.
