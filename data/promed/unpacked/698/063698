>From many years of observing such matters, I am inclined to agree with
Moderator MHJ that fawns and other relatively large mammals who are severely
injured by fire ants were probably downed first by some other form of
illness or injury. I suspect there is an analogy here to how many wildlife
rehabilitators blame cats for injuries to songbirds, who as
tree-or-shrub-nesting insect feeders, often feeding primarily on the wing,
usually are not vulnerable to cats except after exposure to pesticides
(typically following aerial application), or collision with a window or car
(also typically following aerial pesticide applications, in my observation).
Incidentally, despite having looked critically at pesticide spraying since I
first read Silent Spring in the mid-1960s, I've never seen a whole lot of
birds dying of direct effects of pesticide spraying, but when I lived next
to a few hundred acres of cornfields, I'd often see roadkilled birds every
10-20 feet as I jogged along the cornfield frontage a day or so after aerial
spraying, and that's when the barn cats would suddenly start catching the
birds which would elude them the rest of the year.
In short, the "obvious" cause of predation, whether by bugs or cats (or any
other species), may be incorrect, and what is mistaken for predation may
often be scavenging instead.

[However, the subtle negative effects of pesticides are well described.
Unless there are any hard data, especially on long-term fire ant impacts on
wildlife but excluding Snowbirds, I suggest we cut the thread here. - Mod.MHJ
