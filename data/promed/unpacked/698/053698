Azerbaijan: Suspected bird flu case
--------------------------------------
Health authorities in Azerbaijan are treating a 14-year-old boy for
suspected bird flu, the Health Ministry said on Thu 25 Jan 2007. The
boy's sister was one of 5 people who died last year [2006] in an
outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in the former Soviet republic between
Turkey and Russia, the Ministry said. "It is too early to speak of an
exact diagnosis. The boy's blood sample has been sent for analysis to
a laboratory in London and is also being analyzed in Baku," said a
Health Ministry official who did not want to be named. The boy is
being treated in a respiratory illness institute in the capital,
Baku. The previous outbreak began last spring [2006].
The boy now in hospital is from the southern region of Salyan, which
was one of 2 centers of last year's [2006] outbreak. WHO experts
traced the infection then to local people plucking migratory birds to
use their feathers. It said the outbreak was contained, and since
April last year [2006], there have been no confirmed cases in Azerbaijan.
