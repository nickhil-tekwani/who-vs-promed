Turkey: Avian Influenza Situation - WHO Update 3
------------------------------------------------
Tests conducted in Turkish laboratories have confirmed the country's
15th case of human infection with the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The
patient is a 37-year-old woman with a history of exposure to diseased
chickens. She resides in the central province of Sivas, the 7th
province to report cases. Although no poultry outbreaks have been
officially reported in this province, it is located near areas with
confirmed outbreaks in birds.
The situation in birds continues to evolve, with several new
outbreaks under investigation in new parts of the country. All
evidence to date indicates that patients have acquired their
infections following close contact with diseased birds.
The Turkish government has launched an intensive public awareness
campaign. Better public understanding of the disease, supported by
more complete data on disease activity in birds, could help to reduce
the risk of additional human cases, pending control of the disease in
birds. As the majority of confirmed cases and persons under
investigation are children, it is particularly important that
messages about high-risk behaviours reach children.
Some 100 000 treatment courses of oseltamivir (Tamiflu) arrived in
Turkey Friday evening [6 Jan 2006]. This supply, which is being used
for both the treatment of patients and prophylaxis of persons at
risk, is considered by Turkish health officials to be adequate for
responding to the current situation. WHO has organized additional
support for laboratory diagnostic work, and this will be arriving
within the next day or 2.
Dr Marc Danzon, the WHO Director for its European office, will be
arriving in Ankara tomorrow to confer with the country's Minster of
Health. They will assess the situation together and review needs for
further support.
