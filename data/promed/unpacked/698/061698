The South Australian Department of Health has confirmed a Q fever
outbreak at Waikerie in the state's Riverland. The infectious disease
causes flu-like symptoms and is carried by a range of livestock
including sheep, cattle and goats.
Local residents are claiming a nearby goat abattoir is the cause of
the human infection of which there have been 3 confirmed cases and 5
potential.
Mark Gothard from Kerridale International Trading which operates the
abattoir says the facility poses no more risk to residents than local farms.
"It's a possible contributor but there's also, the more I hear about
Q fever, the more I learn about Q fever, the possibility for
infection from animals are so wide and varied you could get it from
almost anywhere," he said.

A fever originating from animals has struck down 3 people who live
near a goat abattoir northeast of Adelaide. The South Australian
Health Department today, 21 Jun 2007, said a small cluster of people
had been diagnosed with Q fever in the Riverland town of Waikerie
since early April 2007.
SA Communicable Diseases Control Branch director Ann Koehler said 3
people had been diagnosed with the fever with another probable case
expected. Ms. Koehler said 4 other people were being tested for the
bacterial infection, which causes flu-like symptoms including fever,
chills and sweats, and can be treated with antibiotics.
People become infected by breathing in contaminated dust from
droppings of infected animals. Ms. Koehler said people should not be
concerned as the 12 cases of the fever diagnosed so far in 2007 was a
low number compared with other colds and influenza.
She said the Loxton Waikerie Council and the Environmental Protection
Authority were working with the abattoir to improve safety.

[Q fever was first described in Australia where this posting
originates. It was called "Query fever" because the causative agent
was initially unknown. _Coxiella burnetii_, the causative agent, was
discovered in 1937. This organism is an agent that can be resistant to
heat and desiccation and highly infectious by the aerosol route. A
single inhaled organism may produce clinical illness. Indeed, in
[non-human] primates, the dose to kill 50 percent of the primates was
found to be 1.7 organisms (1).
Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of _C. burnetii_.
Infection has been noted in a wide variety of other animals,
including other species of livestock and domesticated pets. _C.
burnetii_ does not usually cause clinical disease in these animals,
although abortion in goats and sheep has been linked to _C. burnetii_
infection. Organisms are excreted in milk, urine, and feces of
infected animals. Most importantly, during birthing the organisms are
shed in high numbers within the amniotic fluids and the placenta.
Contact with contaminated wool is known to be a mode of transmission (2).
The organisms can be resistant to heat, drying, and many common
disinfectants. These features enable the bacteria to survive for long
periods in the environment. This very stable form of _C. burnetii_ is
associated with compact small-cell variants of the organism that are
produced during standard replication (along with the less resistant
large-cell form) and are metabolically dormant and spore-like (3).
The Q fever organism is a Category B bioterrorism agent and, in fact,
although not thought to be related to bioterrorism, was spread by
mail in a post office in the UK in 1987 (4).
Infection of humans usually occurs by inhalation of these organisms
from air that contains airborne barnyard dust contaminated by dried
placental material, birth fluids, and excreta of infected herd
animals. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very
few organisms may be required to cause infection.
Ingestion of contaminated milk, followed by regurgitation and
inspiration of the contaminated food, is a less common mode of
transmission. Instances of other modes of transmission to humans,
including tick bites and human to human transmission, are rare.
An earlier outbreak of infection in 51 persons in Scotland, UK, was
tied to a meat processing plant and appeared to spread via aerosol
for at least 1/2 mile.

An ongoing drought in the area may produce more cases related to
easier aerosolization of the organism's infectious form. - Mod.LL]
