Tanzanian coffee production may fall 11 percent in 2009-10
----------------------------------------------------------
Tanzanian coffee production may fall 11 percent in the 12 months
through June 2010 because of disease and lower fertilizer use, the
state-run Tanzania Coffee Board said. The preliminary output forecast
is 55 000 metric tons, compared with 62 000 tons this season
[2008/2009], Adolph Kumburu, director general of the board, said.

"We need to find out the extent of coffee berry disease on the crop
before arriving at the final figure," he said, without giving further
details. Coffee berry disease is a fungus that attacks and destroys
the coffee as it grows.

Tanzania, Africa's 4th-largest coffee producer after Ethiopia,
Uganda, and the Ivory Coast, reaps its crop from April through
August. The country exports almost all its production. A drought late
last year [2008] affected flowering of the crop in some main growing
areas, Kumburu said. "The high cost of fertilizers also means less
usage," he added. The nation is implementing a replanting program
aimed at boosting production to 96 000 tons by 2013.

[Of the 2 commercially grown coffee species, _Coffea arabica_
(arabica or highland coffee) and _Coffea canephora_ (robusta or
lowland coffee), arabica is usually preferred for its taste and
represents 70 percent of coffee grown in Tanzania.

Coffee berry disease (CBD; also called green berry anthracnose) is
caused by the fungus _Colletotrichum kahawae_. _Colletotrichum_
species have been reported from _Coffea_ species wherever they are
grown causing spotting and blackening of fruit. A virulent strain of
_C. coffeanum_, a species reported from Brazil at the end of the 19th
century, was considered the cause of CBD, but the CBD pathogen has
now been classified as a separate species.

CBD occurs only in Africa and affects arabica coffee only with losses
of up to 80 percent. The pathogen affects flowers, immature coffee
berries, and sometimes the beans. Infected berries display dark
sunken spots coalescing into lesions. Berry development may be
arrested resulting in mummified berries on branches. Infected berries
are considered the major source of inoculum, and spores are spread
mainly by wind-blown rain or drops from tree tops. Disease management
includes cultural practices, quarantine, and periodic fungicide
treatments. Some resistant host cultivars exist, and more are being
developed.
