The unusual outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis [SLE] that occurred in Cordoba,
Argentina, between January and May 2005 was detected thanks to research
performed by Dr. Marta Contigiani & Dr. Walter Almiron, both working at the
Dr. J.M. Vanella Virology Institute and the Cordoba Entomological Research
Center, both institutions belonging to Cordoba National University in
Argentina.
The following institutions collaborated in the outbreak investigation:
- Ministry of Health - Cordoba Province
- Dr. J. I. Maiztegui Institute for Human Viral Diseases, Pergamino,
Argentinian Ministry of Health, Buenos Aires
- Carlos III Health Institute - Madrid, Spain
- Health Secretariat, Cordoba City Council.
Previously detected prevalence of human neutralizing antibodies (against St.
Louis encephalitis virus) in Cordoba City was 13.98 percent [in 2005], in 2002
one case of encephalitis was reported, and 2 additional cases were detected by
the dengue fever surveillance system.
The analysis of febrile cases with neurological symptoms occurring since
January 2005 was performed by IgM antibody (Ab) detection using Mac-ELISA and
indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) testing, using the St. Louis encephalitis
virus as an antigen (other flaviviruses were also detected due to cross-
reaction).
Vero cell [monkey kidney tissue culture] neutralization testing was used for
confirming the results. 72 cases that presented with symptoms ranging from
headache and fever to aseptic meningitis or encephalitis occurring in Cordoba
City and neighbouring areas between mid-January and the end of May 2005 were
studied.
The 1st case was detected in the 3rd epidemiological week [January 2005] in
Cordoba City, and the highest number of cases was reached during the 10th
epidemiological week [March 2005]. Patients were between 7 and 87 years old.
With respect to the clinical presentation, elderly patients developed an
encephalitis syndrome, while the remaining patients developed aseptic
meningoencephalitis or febrile headache.
Also, the elderly developed neurological sequelae. Most frequent clinical
signs and symptoms were: fever (above 38 degree C), headache, disorientation,
confusion, consciousness impairment, and asthenia [weakness]. 15 patients with
a severe clinical condition had one or more co-morbidities, such as high blood
pressure, diabetes, cardiac or kidney disease, alcoholism and malnutrition.
IgM antibodies were detected in 45 of 72 serum samples obtained during the
acute period, and in 21 cerebrospinal fluid samples. In 11 patients
seroconversion [between paired blood specimens taken early and late in the
course of the disease] was found by neutralization tests [indicating
infection], and 16 patients whose [single] samples were obtained later in the
course of the disease had neutralization test titers higher than 1/160 with no
seroconversion for St. Louis encephalitis virus. No neutralizing antibodies
against Ilheus virus or West Nile virus were detected [viruses which belomg to
the same family as SLEV]. Of the 8 IgM-positive patients who died, 6 were
elderly [the presence of IgM antibody signifies recent infection.]
Simultaneously with the serological studies, mosquito capture in the homes of
some patients was performed. 2 positive pools of _Culex quinquefasciatus_ and
one positive pool of _Culex interferor_ were found using RT Nested PCR [a very
specific test for viral nucleic acid], and 2 viral strains were isolated from
the captured insects.
Sequencing in a region of NS5 protein confirmed that the strains isolated
correspond to St. Louis encephalitis virus and that they are related to the
strain 78V6507 isolated in 1978 in Santa Fe Province, Argentina. The viral
strains isolated were identified as St. Louis encephalitis virus using a
neutralization technique.
This is the 1st time that a St. Louis encephalitis outbreak had been reported
[in the area]. The outbreak has affected all age groups in Cordoba City and
the neighboring areas. Considering the endemicity of St. Louis encephalitis
virus, with sporadic cases in Cordoba Province, as well as in other cool and
subtropical regions in the country, and also taking into account the absence
of neutralizing antibodies against other flaviviruses and the isolation of St.
Louis encephalitis strains, this proves that the etiological agent for this
outbreak is the aforementioned virus.
The following personnel participated in the investigation: Dr. Marta
Contigiani; Dr. Walter Almiron; Lorena Spinsanti, Biologist; Luis Adrian
D�, Biologist; Dr. Maria Alejandra Morales; Viviana Re, Biologist;
Adrian Far�, Biologist; Dr. Nora Gladstein; Dr. Sergio Arselan; Javier
Aguilar, Biochemist; Dr. Antonio Tenorio, and Dr. Ana Vasquez.

[ProMED is grateful to Dr. Marta S. Contigiani for this special report on the
detailed investigation of the outbreak of SLEV infections and deaths in
Cordoba, including serologic and molecular confirmation. [In addition], 2
strains of SLEV were successfully isolated and partially sequenced from
captured Culex mosquitoes from 3 infected pools. - Mod.RY]
[SLE is endemic in wild birds throughout South America, and is transmitted to
humans when a mosquito that has previously fed on an infected bird feeds again
on a human. For a diagram of the transmission cycle see:
<http://www.lawestvector.org/images/Arbocycl.GIF>
Given that West Nile virus is on its way south in migrating birds, it is
important to use lab diagnostic tests such as PCR that clearly distinguish
these 2 diseases. - Mod.JW]
