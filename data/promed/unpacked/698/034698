Fluoroquinolone-Resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae - San Diego, California, 1997.
The fluoroquinolones ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin are among the
antimicrobials recommended for treating uncomplicated gonorrhea.
Fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_ have been
identified frequently during the 1990s in the Far East. In the United
States, fluoroquinolone-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_ has been reported
sporadically; resistance associated with clinical treatment failure has
been reported previously in only one person, who probably acquired the
infection in the Philippines. This report describes the results of an
investigation in 1997 of two cases of gonococcal infection in the United
States with strains with a higher level of fluoroquinolone resistance than
reported previously; clinical treatment failure occurred in one case...
MMWR Editorial Note: Fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins became the
recommended therapies for gonorrhea following the appearance of penicillin-
and tetracycline-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_ during the 1980s and early
1990s . Fluoroquinolone-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_ (ciprofloxacin MIC equal
to or greater than 1.0 mg/mL or ofloxacin MIC equal to or greater than 2.0
mg/mL) [MIC = minimal inhibitory concentration emerged during the 1990s
and became well-established in several areas (e.g., Hong Kong, Japan, and
the Philippines). During the same period in the United States, _N.
gonorrhoeae_ with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC 0.125-0.5
mg/mL) became endemic in at least one area and occurred sporadically in
other areas. Among the 26 clinics participating in GISP, the overall
prevalence of _N. gonorrhoeae_ with decreased susceptibility to
ciprofloxacin was 0.3% in 1991 and 0.4% in January-June 1997 (CDC,
unpublished data).
The isolates from the two patients described in this report had the highest
level of fluoroquinolone resistance ever reported in the United States.
Failure of infection to respond to single-dose therapy with 500 mg of
ciprofloxacin has been reported with strains of _N. gonorrhoeae_ with MICs
equal to or greater than 1.0 mg/mL, but data are limited. In one trial,
treatment with 500 mg ciprofloxacin failed to cure 45% of patients who had
infections caused by _N. gonorrhoeae_ with ciprofloxacin MICs equal to or
greater than 4.0 mg/mL . In San Diego, doxycycline probably was the
effective component of therapy because the isolates had tetracycline MICs
at the low end of the resistance range (equal to or greater than 2.0 mg/mL).
Identifying the sources of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of _N.
gonorrhoeae_ found in the United States has been difficult, but some
infections have been linked to importation from Southeast Asia and contact
with commercial sex workers. In San Diego, both patients had anonymous sex
contacts, but no international link was found. Military personnel travel
frequently to Asia and are a potential source of imported strains of
antimicrobial-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_. However, the military treatment
regimen decreases the likelihood of spread of fluoroquinolone-resistant
strains.
Although the two San Diego isolates were the same strain, no epidemiologic
link between the two patients could be identified. Despite enhanced
surveillance, no additional cases of fluoroquinolone-resistant _N.
gonorrhoeae_ have been detected in San Diego. The spread of
fluoroquinolone-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_ locally may be limited by the
frequent use of cephalosporins for treating gonorrhea.
Because fluoroquinolone-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_ is rare in the United
States, CDC recommends fluoroquinolones to treat gonococcal infections.
However, ceftriaxone, cefixime, or spectinomycin should be used if the
infection was acquired in Asia. In some areas (e.g., Cleveland, Ohio) where
strains with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones are endemic,
fluoroquinolones should not be used to treat gonorrhea because these
strains may represent a pool from which fluoroquinolone-resistant strains
may emerge. Clinicians should obtain a culture and request susceptibility
testing for any patient with apparent treatment failure after recommended
therapy and report these cases promptly to the local health department.
This investigation underscores the importance of timely surveillance for
antibiotic-resistant _N. gonorrhoeae_. As clinical laboratories
increasingly use nonculture methods for the diagnosis of gonorrhea, the
importance of maintaining _N. gonorrhoeae_ culture capability and the
ability to measure antimicrobial susceptibility in public health
laboratories increases. Laboratories serving patients with gonococcal
infections should maintain culture capability to evaluate patients with
apparent treatment failure. Laboratories should report any isolates meeting
proposed National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards criteria for
resistance to ciprofloxacin (MIC equal to or greater than 1.0 mg/mL; zone
inhibition diameter [5 mg disk equal to or greater than 27 mm) or
ofloxacin (MIC equal to or greater than 2.0 mg/mL; zone inhibition diameter
[5 mg disk equal to or greater than 24 mm) to their state public health
laboratory. CDC laboratories will confirm resistant isolates.

[Fluoroquinolones inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase enzymes which normally
facilitate the unwinding of DNA strands during replication. Resistance
generally results from mutations in one of the subunits of the bacterial
enzyme such that the fluoroquinolone molecules are no longer sufficiently
active. - Mod.ES
