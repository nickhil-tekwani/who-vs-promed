["Equine rhinopneumonitis is a collective term for any one of several highly contagious, clinical disease entities of equids that may occur as a result of infection with equid herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).

Infection with EHV-1 is characterised by a primary respiratory tract disease of varying severity that is related to the age and immunological status of the infected animal. Infections with EHV-1 are capable of progression beyond the respiratory mucosa to cause abortion, perinatal foal death, or neurological dysfunction". http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&L=0&htmfile=chapitre_equine_rhinopneumonitis.htm

Until 2014, the disease was reported to the OIE as Equine Rhinopneumonitis, but since then, it is reported as Equid herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1).
