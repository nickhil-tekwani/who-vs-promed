FOOT & MOUTH DISEASE, GAUR - INDIA: SUSPECTED (02)
**************************************************
A ProMED-mail post

In response to ProMED-mail's call for comments in 200205290653:
The implication of this posting is that other wildlife species as well as
gaur are affected, but that no other cloven-hoofed species are involved.
This implies that non-cloven hoofed species are affected.
As far as I recall, the known non-cloven hoofed range of foot and mouth
disease (FMD) includes the Asian elephant and the hedgehog. FMD is well
known to Indian veterinarians as it is endemic in the country, so I would
expect that they could diagnose it quite easily (although [to exclude]
vaccine [type] would need typing; most FMD in South Asia seems to be type O
at the moment). So I am left wondering if this is indeed FMD or perhaps
some other virus. As is so often the case, a description of the symptoms
and more details of the animals affected and not affected (species, numbers
of cases, number of deaths, even if only approximate) would help.
Vaccination should definitely be postponed until a diagnosis is determined.

[Dr Honhold is gratefully acknowledged for his valid comments. Could our
Indian colleagues help regarding the missing data, and inform about the
outcome of laboratory investigations of samples from gaur and from
livestock in neighboring farms? - Mod.AS]
