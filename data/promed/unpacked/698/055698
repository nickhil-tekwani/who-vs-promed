950 birds, infected by the virus AH7N3, slaughtered
---------------------------------------------------
The Ministry of Agriculture confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza [HPAI] AH7N3 in the community of Santa Cruz El Porvenir, Ixtacuixtla Township, Tlaxcala. The National Health, Safety and Quality Service (Senasica) ordered the immediate depopulation of backyard poultry as a preventive measure; 950 chickens and turkeys from neighboring properties have been culled.

According to preliminary investigations, the virus has been introduced by an unauthorised shipment of live birds from a zone under quarantine in the center west of the country.

Yesterday [Thu 25 Apr 2013] Senasica technicians applied control measures within a 10-km radius zone around the outbreak's location. 60 holdings in 13 municipalities of Tlaxcala have been inspected; no birds with clinical signs of disease have been detected.

According to the results of tests carried out on 123 samples collected by the Senaica laboratory (Biosafety Level 3), located in Palo Alto, Federal District, no commercial farm is currently affected by the said virus. The outbreak is thus limited to the initial backyard focus.

Following the stamping out applied on the affected holding[s], cleaning and disinfection of the premises are being applied. Sentinel birds will be introduced to make sure the virus is not present any longer. This will enable repopulation of the backyard farms and conclude the outbreak. Among the preventive measures implemented by the Senasica, was the operation of checkpoints to implement the ban on the transportation of live birds, their products and by-products without official permits.
