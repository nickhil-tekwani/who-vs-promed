Dreadful, life-threatening, and infectious pneumococcal meningitis has hit Ghana, taking 93 lives so far since last year [2016].

Pneumococcal meningitis is caused by _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, a bacterium that affects the lungs and is easily spread through coughing, sneezing, and prolonged body contact with an infected person. Living in a crowded setting, intimate kissing, and eating from the same bowl or drinking from the same cup as an infected person can equally help spread the disease-causing bacteria.

Babies and children, mostly under 18 months of age, in most cases stand a higher risk of acquiring the disease in the early stages of their lives.

The disease has an incubation period of about 2-10 days before producing symptoms, which include neck pain, neck stiffness, convulsion, and vomiting.

Seasonal reports on pneumococcal meningitis in Ghana usually come during the dry season from October to March, with the worst affected regions being the Ashanti, Central, Brong Ahafo and Northern region due to relatively low humidity and abundance of dust.

A thorough autopsy revealed that 4 students of Kumasi Academy Senior High in the Ashanti region died this year [2017] of the disease.

Marylin Amediwa, a nursing student at Pentecost University, when interviewed about the worrying disease, said that pneumococcal meningitis causes the same symptoms as malaria and fever, sounding a word of caution to Ghanaians to refrain from self-medication. [Although both meningitis and malaria present with malaise, shaking chills, and fever, meningitis, unlike malaria, presents additionally with neck stiffness and pain].

An infected person stands a chance of receiving early treatment with prescribed antibiotics should the victim consult the hospital on time when symptom show themselves.

ProMED-mail last posted on a pneumococcal meningitis outbreak in Ghana in January 2016, when the number of cases had risen to 55 and the number of deaths to "slightly over 19."

Use of a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine would be beneficial. Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines reduce nasopharyngeal carriage of serotypes of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ contained in the vaccine and thus person-to-person transmission of these pathogens, which occurs by close contact with respiratory secretions or saliva.

In neighboring Burkina Faso, a study found that the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which includes serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F, was protective against only 8 per cent of the local isolates (http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.full). The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, Prevnar 13, which covers serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F, may be more effective, but we are not told the serotypes of pneumococci causing this outbreak in Ghana.

The 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is included in the recommended routine infant immunization schedule in the U.S. (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent.html), but not in Ghana (http://collections.infocollections.org/whocountry/en/d/Js6861e/6.1.html#Js6861e.6.1).

Information from knowledgeable sources regarding the serotypes of _S. pneumoniae_ involved in this outbreak in Ghana would be welcomed. - Mod.ML
