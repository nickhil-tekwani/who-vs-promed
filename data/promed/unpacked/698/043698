West Nile virus fever has taken the life of a new person in Sevilla. The woman is the 5th fatal victim since the 1st week of August [2020] when the 1st hospitalizations occurred.

The 77-year-old woman is a resident of Cora del Rio who had been for several weeks in the intensive care unit of the Virgin del Rocio Hospital and who at the end could not overcome the disease that was caused by the bite of a mosquito that had become infected from feeding on an ill bird.

During the stay in the hospital, she had been in a vegetative state nearly the whole time, according to responses to ABC from sources close to the family. Although she managed to wake up slightly, in the end, she suffered a cerebral infarction this past Tue 22 Sep 2020 that ended her life during the time when she was admitted to the unit.

With her, there are now 5 people in Sevilla who have died as a consequence of West Nile virus [infection], a disease that causes meningoencephalitis. The 1st was a 77-year-old resident of La Puebla del Rio on 21 Aug 2020, and the 2nd, who was also from this municipality and 85-years-old, on 23 Aug 2020. The 3rd person was 70 years old from Coria del Rio on 28 Aug 2020, and the 4th, a farmer from the district of Pizon, Utrera who spent long periods in the plots where he grew all kinds of food but who lived in the capital Seville, on 9 Sep 2020. He had been discharged from hospital. In addition to these 5 fatal victims are added another 3 in Cadiz province.

Since the beginning of this health crisis, which has left a balance of more than 50 confirmed cases, the disease has been limited to the coastal municipalities of the Lower Guadalquivir. Later positive cases began to be recognized in the province of Cadiz. Here, another 3 people have lost their lives, 2 in Puerto Real and one in Vejer de la Frontera. The last group included a 72-year-old man who was admitted to the Puerto Real Hospital. Also included were a 87-year-old woman and a 59-year-old farmer from Vejer de la Frontera, who died.

In Sevilla, the number of positive samples is 31, and the number of confirmed cases is 25. The total number of hospitalized patients is 5, of whom 3 remain in the ICU, among whom is a 14-year-old from Coria del Rio. In Cadiz, the number of confirmed cases is 9, and the number of positive samples is 3. The total of hospitalized patients is one.

West Nile virus causes a disease that is transmitted to people by mosquito bites and can also affect birds, horses and other mammals. Some 80% of infected people are asymptomatic according to the WHO, and 20% may show symptoms and have brain damage that can lead to death.

This past Wed 23 Sep 2020, the delegate of the Junta de Andalucia in Seville, Ricardo Sanchez, and the delegate in the province of Health and Families, Regina Serrano, visited Coria del Rio to verify the execution of phase 2 of the Control Action Plan on the mosquitoes that spread the West Nile fever virus. This plan was launched on 7 Sep 2020 by the board itself and includes the work of analysis and countermeasures being carried out within a comprehensive control strategy using the most modern equipment, including drones.

All actions are supervised by a technical working group made up of technicians from the Andalucia government board, the municipalities involved, and the successful bidder. This Action Plan will last until the end of 2020 to attend to any contingency that may arise in the coming weeks, as well as to build the foundations of preventive control for the year 2021.

Previously, the municipalities affected by the vector mosquito carried out the 1st phase of the plan, consisting of insecticide treatment of parks and gardens of the municipalities.

[Spain has been having ongoing West Nile virus (WNV) transmission over the course of this summer (2020). WNV has been endemic in this region of Spain for at least 2 decades. It is usually transmitted in this locality by _Culex pipiens_ and _Culex [perexiquus]_ mosquitoes.

Interestingly, no mention is made of WNV infection in horses in the above report or in previous ones this year (2020). Equine cases usually occur before human ones do. There is a vaccine available for equine animals, but not for humans, so vector mosquito control and avoidance of mosquito bites are the only measures available to prevent infection in people. - Mod.TY
