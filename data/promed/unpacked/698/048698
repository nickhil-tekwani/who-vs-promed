It appears that certain Kenya government and non-government (Nairobi-based
African Medical Research Foundation; AMREF), spokespeople have reservations
about accepting the WHO statement that the epidemic there and in Somalia is
due to Rift Valley fever (RVF) virus. 310 people are known to have died
since the epidemic was recognized in early December but the total number is
unknown because of lack of access to the region.
The reservations stem from the high mortality rate in humans and animals.
An epidemiologist, and head of the communicable diseases unit of the Kenyan
Health Ministry, said the mortality rate was not consistent with RVF, that
entire herds are being killed by the disease and that in the past it has
been younger animals which died.
Others said it was impossible to draw conclusions from laboratory tests
carried out so far, while flooding in the region had now cut off access to
health workers. [This may be my favorite sentence of all time. - Mod.CHC
The AMREF representative was quoted as saying that many camels and goats
are hemorrhaging to death and that camels and goats do not get RVF, usually
only cattle and sheep.

Handbook of viral and hemorrhagic fevers. JHS Gear (ed.), CRC Press, Boca
Raton, FL; pp 101-118}; {Fenner F, Bachmann PA, Gibbs EPJ, Murphy FA,

Valley fever. (in) Zoonoses and communicable diseases common to man and
animals. 2nd Ed., PanAm. Hlth. Org., Washington, D.C.; pp 449-454.}, I am
able to make the following comments:
Given the deplorable medical and veterinary situation that has been
described for the Kenyan epidemic zone, it is likely that a plethora of
diseases is occurring there; malaria and anthrax, certainly. It is also
possible that these are underlying or accessory causes for reduced
resistance to RVF. RVFV has been isolated in Bob Swanepoel's lab from
Kenyan specimens and RVFV is known to cause retinitis, encephalitis, and
hemorrhagic disease in humans, all of which have been seen in the current
episode.
The media report noted that the Kenyan epidemiologist had said that only
about 5% of people infected with RVFV normally develop clinical symptoms
and that a majority of those are able to survive without treatment. True
enough, but that is "normally".
In regards to the comments that the mortality rate was not consistent with
RVF, that entire herds are being killed by the disease, whereas in the past
it has been younger animals which died, and that camels and goats do not
get RVF -- that is not what my sources indicate. Meegan and Bailey note
that "Field studies and laboratory investigations indicate that within 2 to
6 days after RVFV infects a flock of sheep, 90 to 100% of lambs under 7
days of age die, 20 to 60% of older lambs and adult sheep die, and 90 to
100% of the pregnant ewes abort. The statistics are less definitive for
cattle, but 10 to 70% of calves and 10 to 20% of adult cattle die, milk
production decreases, and 80 to 100% of the pregnant cows abort. Other
domestic animal data are limited, but losses due to abortions could be
extensive among goats and perhaps domestic African buffaloes and camels."
The chapter in Fenner et al. says, in part, that the RVF epidemic in Egypt
(1977-78) resembled "in detail the biblical description of one of the
plagues of ancient Egypt"; see Exodus 8 and 9.
We must await definitive epidemiological studies, if such are in the
offing. - Mod.CHC

[According to Acha & Szyfres (1986) "Rift Valley fever occurs natually in
sheep, goats, cattle, and buffaloes. In some outbreaks the disease is seen
only in lambs, while in others it also occurs in adult sheep and cattle."
"Camels don't get Rift Valley Fever" is not strictly correct -- they may
not die of RVF, but camels imported from the Sudan were certainly suspected
as the source of the last 2 outbreaks in Egypt. After the 1977-78 outbreak
the HI seroprevalences for livestock in the Nile Valley were sheep [35.7%,
goats [6.8%, buffaloes [19.3%, cattle [56.6%, donkeys [2.0%, and camels
[31.4%. (Hoogstraal, H et al, Trans Roy Soc Trop Med Hyg 1979 73:624-629)
Over 30% of Sudanese camels sampled on the Eygptian side of the border and
due to be immediately trekked further north, demonstrated HI antibodies;
the Sudan is the traditional source of camels for Eygpt and were again the
apparent cause of the Eygptian RVF epidemic in the mid-'80s. Somali meat
camels are imported in similarly large numbers by Saudi Arabia. - Mods.MHJ
