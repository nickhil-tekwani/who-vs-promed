The Columbus Health Department on Mon 5 Nov 2007 confirmed that 46
students in the Worthington City School district have been diagnosed
with whooping cough. The outbreak started in early October 2007 and
additional students were being tested for the disease, 10TV's Kurt
Ludlow reported.

In October 2007, the Columbus Health Department confirmed that 5
students at Worthington Kilbourne High School were diagnosed with
whooping cough. The school district confirmed more cases late last
week. At least one student at Thomas Worthington High School was
diagnosed with whooping cough, 10TV News reported.

Columbus public health commissioner Dr Teresa Long said vaccines are
extremely important in thwarting the spread of whooping cough.
"Please, do not wait. Do not wait to get your children vaccinated,"
Long said. "A vaccine now is very important because we want to
protect going into the Thanksgiving holiday [22 Nov 2007]. There will
be more families gathering and we do not want to see the spread of
this outbreak any further."

Health officials said parents should also check immunization records
to ensure that children have had the appropriate vaccines. The
booster shot is usually available through a family physician.

Long said Worthington students who have not had the booster shot
should do so immediately.

[Whether culture or polymerase chain reaction assays were used to
diagnose _Bordetella pertussis_ in this outbreak is not stated. The
CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) publication on
controlling pertussis outbreaks (1) is an excellent reference on not
only diagnosis and treatment, but also epidemiology and control
measures in a variety of settings including those of household,
childcare, school, and health care environments.

As a reminder, the 5 dose primary series for
diphtheria/tetanus/acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine in children is
recommended (2) at ages 2, 4, 6, 15-18 months, and 4-6 years. A
booster of Tdap (lower dose of diphtheria and pertussis immunogens)
is then recommended (2) between ages 11-12 or before age 18 if not
given. Additionally, a single dose of Tdap is now recommended in
adults (3) to be given to replace a dose of the every-10 year Td
booster for adults aged less than 65 years who have not previously
received a dose of Tdap. This dose is particularly important in
adults (pediatric health care workers, new parents, and grandparents)
who are likely to be in contact with young children of the age
precluding them from being adequately protected from pertussis. These
infants are the cohort group with the highest morbidity and mortality
from pertussis.
