Update of the foot-and-mouth disease situation as of 22 Jan 2014
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. No additional cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) have been recorded within and around the outbreaks in Iksal (reported 14 Jan 2014) and Tira (reported 16 Jan 2014).

2. The isolate from Tirah has been serotyped O, similar to the previous one, from Iksal.

3. According to information from the Veterinary Services of the Palestinian Authority, 6 new FMD outbreaks have been observed during the recent days in the West Bank. They were located in the districts Ramallah, Hebron and Jericho and involved sheep/goats flocks; no cases seen in cattle.

Samples from the said new outbreaks, for laboratory confirmation, are expected to be received soon at the Kimron Veterinary Institute, Beit-Dagan.

Until a clear picture of the disease situation in the West Bank becomes available, transport of sheep/goats between the West Bank and the Gaza strip is banned.

Revaccinations are being applied.

[The absence of additional cases in the infected sheep farms in Iksal and Tira (Israel) may be indicative of the efficacy of the applied vaccine and/or the relevance of the vaccine strains included.

The current epizootic started in mid-November 2013, when outbreaks were reported from cattle in Majdal Shams in north Israel (Golan, adjacent to Syrian/Lebanese borders) and from sheep/goats in Jericho, PA (adjacent to the Jordanian border).

According to the results of the genotyping performed by WRLFMD (Pirbright, UK) in samples from both outbreaks, both were caused by a serotype O FMD virus which belongs to topotype ME-SA, genotype/strain PanAsia-2FAR-09, and which is closely related to Turkish ME-SA PanAsia-2FAR-09 isolates of 2013 (1.25 and 1.41 percent VP1 differences, respectively with the Israeli and the PA isolates). The previous epizootic in Israel (2011/2012) was caused by a different genotype, namely ME-SA PanAsia-2ANT-10. (for Middle East -- including Israel and PA -- WRLFMD genotyping reports, go to http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/middle_east.html).

Stram et al. (reference below) have sequenced the complete viral VPI genes of representative viruses isolated during the major outbreaks in Israel from 1989 to 2007. The resulting phylogenetic analysis showed that each outbreak was initiated by introduction of a new virus lineage and not by endemic and resident viruses. The differences between the nucleotide sequences of the viruses from the various outbreaks were too big to fit a model of outbreaks caused by endemic virus. Based on this approach, it was revealed that a 2002 outbreak originated with viruses that circulated in the Arabian peninsula in 1997-1998.

The fact that the current epizootic in Israel and the PA is caused by a different serotype O genotype than the previous one may fit in the scenario described above, namely the periodic new introductions rather than endemic situation in Israel/PA. On the other hand, the close genetic relatedness between the current isolates in Israel/PA and contemporary Turkish isolates are suggestive of considerable virus circulation within the Eastern Mediterranean region. As commented in the Monthly Disease Situation Report of FAO/EuFMD for November 2013, "this highlights the need for more surveillance in countries in the neighbourhood of Turkey, Israel and Palestine to determine the FMD situation more accurately."

Official, updated FMD information from the PA with complementary data, including morbidity/mortality, control measures and laboratory test results, are anticipated.
