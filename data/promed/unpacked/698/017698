Black rot of sweet potato alert
-------------------------------
Recently, several samples of sweet potato black rot have been submitted to NCSU. Black rot has historically been a very significant disease of sweet potato in the US, but it has not been a major problem in recent years due to better management practices. This year [2014] in North Carolina, we have seen an increased number of confirmed cases in [several] counties.

Black rot of sweet potato is caused by the fungus _Ceratocystis fimbriata_. Symptoms generally appear at harvest or during storage and consist of a dry, firm, dark-colored rot that does not extend into the cortex of the root. Infections typically begin at wounds, lenticels, or lateral roots and can expand during storage. Infected slips [shoots] develop dark, sunken cankers below the soil surface and severe infections can result in the stunting, wilting and even death of sprouts.

Black rot of sweet potato can be a devastating disease that can contaminate equipment and packing lines [and] can survive in the soil for several years. It can be effectively prevented and controlled through proper cultural practices. Sweet potatoes should not be planted in fields where sweet potatoes have been grown in the past 3-4 years. Morning glories serve as an alternate host. Transplants should be disease free and treated with a fungicide. Tools should be cleaned to prevent pathogen spread. Fungicides are not effective against established infections.

To minimize additional losses during storage, curing of roots will allow for harvest injuries to heal and prevent secondary infections. It is important to sanitize storage facilities, washing machines and packing lines. Following the control strategies highlighted above, outbreaks of this disease can be limited.

If the disease goes undiagnosed and proper sanitation is not practiced, significant losses can occur.

[_Ceratocystis fimbriata_ (Cf) is currently considered a fungal species complex. The different species/strains cause rots, wilts and cankers on many hosts, including important crop and forest species, but vary in host specificity. The sweet potato strain of Cf has a narrow host range; sweet potato (_Ipomoea batatas_) and "morning glories" mentioned above belong to genera in the family Convolvulaceae.

CF strains are soilborne and also spread by water, mechanical means (for example on cutting tools) and with planting material (cuttings, seedlings). Beetles have been reported as important vectors in some hosts.

Disease management of soil borne fungi may include phytosanitary measures, crop rotation and use of certified disease-free planting material. Fungicides are generally not very effective, but may be helpful as treatments for seedlings or scions before release for planting. Genetic resistance is generally considered the best means of control, and sweet potato cultivars with reduced black rot sensitivity are available.
