NEW PARASITIC DISEASE - CANADA, USA
===================================
This week 36 separate medical journals are highlighting the prevailing threat
from emerging infectious diseases.
Kudos go out to TROPMED list member JD Maclean at McGill for the long feature
article (with color pictures no less) in this week's Lancet which describes
for the first time human disease (19 cases) with the North American liver
fluke Metorchis conjunctus.
ref: Lancet 347:8995, 154-158 (1996)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[- This fluke was consumed in a meal of 'White Sucker' (Catostomus commersoni).
The fluke has previously been found causing severe disease in sled dogs.
It has been recovered from a wide range of Canadian and northern American
carnivores ... wolves, foxes, coyotes, raccoons, muskrats, mink, fisher,
dogs and cats. MH-J ProMED-AHEAD Moderator
