16 new CWD cases found in Hampshire County
------------------------------------------
The slow growth and spread of chronic wasting disease [CWD] continues in
West Virginia. DNR [Division of Natural Resources] Biologists report 16
deer killed by hunters in the 2009 deer season tested positive for the
presence of CWD. The DNR pulled those positives from 1091 deer killed by
hunters in Hampshire at local checking stations during the season.

"It's not the greatest news and certainly wasn't the Christmas present I
was hoping to open, but you know when you're dealing with CWD and lots of
unknowns associated with it, having a result with 16 positives was not
necessarily unexpected at all," said Paul Johansen, chief of the DNR's Game
Management on West Virginia Outdoors.

The 16 infected whitetails included one 4.5 year old doe, a 2.5 year old
doe, one 1.5 year old buck, ten 2.5 year old bucks, and three 3.5 year old
bucks.

The DNR discovered chronic wasting disease in 2005 in a road killed deer
near the community of Slanesville. Since that time a containment zone was
established north of Route 50 in Hampshire County with special restrictions
on hunting and constant monitoring. This year's [2009] count included
13-infected deer within that zone and 2 from outside the border, but still
within Hampshire County.

"This is not the 1st time we've detected a positive outside that
containment zone," said Johansen. "We're going to have to take a look at
that containment zone and see if it should be expanded."

CWD is an incredibly slow disease. Although deer may be infected, they show
no signs of the illness until in the very last stages when they become
emaciated and disoriented. Otherwise, infected deer show no signs they are
carrying the virus without testing of the brain or spinal tissue.
Researchers conclude feeding or baiting deer is one of the fastest ways to
spread the virus with nose-to-nose contact. Restrictions have been placed
on feeding and baiting deer in the containment area.

"Despite our agency's best efforts, we continue to struggle with CWD in
Hampshire County," said DNR director Frank Jezioro. "I am particularly
concerned that some individuals are not complying with regulations
prohibiting the feeding and baiting of deer within the Hampshire County CWD
Containment Area."

"In certain areas of the containment zone we have information to indicate
there is some baiting and feeding activity that's going on," said Johansen.
"That concerns us as we try to grapple with this disease." The agency plans
to renew efforts to engage the public's help in controlling the spread and
compliance with restrictions enacted to slow the spread. Those efforts will
include additional law enforcement activities if needed.

"As we strive to meet this wildlife disease challenge and implement
appropriate management strategies, the continued support and involvement of
landowners and hunters will be essential," Jezioro said. "The WVDNR remains
committed to keeping the public informed and involved in these wildlife
disease management actions as we go forward."

The CWD Management Strategy to this point includes the following
restrictions in Hampshire County:
- implemented CWD testing efforts designed to determine the prevalence and
distribution of the disease;
- established antlerless deer hunting regulations designed to increase
hunter opportunity to harvest female deer, adjust deer populations to
desired levels, and reduce the risk of spreading the disease from deer to
deer;
- established deer carcass transport restrictions designed to lower the
risk of moving the disease to other locations;
- established regulations designed to prohibit the feeding and baiting of
deer within the affected area and reduce the risk of spreading the disease
from deer to deer.

Hunters concerned about consumption of venison from infected animals are
advised to use their own judgment. Researchers and DNR biologist say
there's no known instance of CWD affecting humans.

[As hunting seasons across the United States draw to a close, we are likely
to see several reports indicating a slow spread in some states as the
surveillance of hunter-killed animals become tested, tabulated, and
reported. It is important to remember that CWD has not been shown to have
transmissibility to humans. - Mod.TG
