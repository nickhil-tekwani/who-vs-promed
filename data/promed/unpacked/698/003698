The number of outbreaks among birds of avian flu in Romania has
reached 88, with a further 23 suspected outbreak locations, as of
noon Sunday [28 May 2006], the Romanian news agency Rompres said.
A month after the strain was said to have been eradicated in the
Black Sea state, most of the current cases have been reported in the
central region of Transylvania.
The latest outbreaks originated from a poultry farm in the county of
Brasov, some 170 km north of Bucharest.
Last Friday [26 May 2006; see 20060527.1490], the Agriculture
Ministry confirmed in a statement that the bird flu virus had been
found "in 75 localities from 13 counties. There are also 35 suspect
locations. The national institute for animal health is further
testing suspect deaths in fowl," the statement said.
Reports here said 3 districts in the capital Bucharest are among
those affected and among the 13 counties, Brasov was at the top with
28 outbreaks.
Over the past 12 days alone, authorities have culled 500 000 birds to
prevent the spread of the virus, which a World Health Organisation
expert says "has broken out very rapidly."
The Romanians have culled one million fowl and dealt with 60
outbreaks of bird flu since the first case was detected in the Danube
delta during 2005, officials say.
To date the country has not reported any cases of bird flu in people.

Romania found a suspected case of bird flu in a house on the
outskirts of Bucharest on Tuesday, as authorities struggled to
contain a new wave of the deadly disease which has hit poultry across
the country.
More than 100 outbreaks have been found in the last 3 weeks, some in
Bucharest and many around a poultry farm about 170 km (100 miles)
north of the capital which had sold live chickens without health
certificates.
Romania was the first country to detect the virus in birds in Europe
during 2005 but it had contained the first wave of the disease
earlier in 2006.
"Tests which are 99 percent precise detected the bird flu virus in
poultry from a household in the Bucharest's Sector 1 and we prepare
to cull the several hundred domestic birds from the neighbourhood,"
said veterinary authority spokeswoman Alina Monea. Nearly one million
fowl have been culled in recent weeks, mainly in Transylvania, she
said.
On Monday, the government said it would increase fines for poultry
farms which do not take security measures to prevent the spread of
the virus.
Romania, which is struggling to demonstrate its ability to deal with
food safety problems ahead of its accession to the European Union as
early as January [2007?], has not reported any cases of bird flu in
people.

[Romania's last official notification to the OIE, dated 24 May 2006,
included the following "Description of affected population",
providing the explanation to the 3-step extensive spread of the virus
from 2 commercial farms in Codlea (see
<http://www.oie.int/eng/info/hebdo/aIS_17.htm#Sec2>):
1. Outbreak in Codlea: chickens and turkeys in a commercial farm; the
affected chickens, aged 32-35 days, showed clinical signs including
anorexia, diarrhoea and cyanosis (skin, combs and wattles).
2. Outbreaks in Bacau, Beclean, Bolotesti, Brasov, Bucuresti, Buzau,
Buzaului, Dumbravita, Neamt, Sibiu, Sita, Vistea and Vrancea: all
poultry came from backyard premises in Brasov, Covasna and Vrancea
counties and originally bought from SC Drakom Silva SRL and SC Pati
Prod Co SRL in Codlea. They showed clinical signs immediately after
their introduction into the premises.
Further spread means potentially exposing more humans to infected
birds; in other words, enhancing the risk of human infection. -
