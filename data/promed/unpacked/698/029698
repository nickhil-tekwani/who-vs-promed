Survival of Foot & Mouth Disease Virus in the Environment
---------------------------------------------------------
The following is an extract from the USDA Aphis "Survival of Foot and Mouth
Disease Virus (FMDV) and Spread by International Travelers." The article
states that FMDV can persist for up to 9 weeks on clothing, luggage, and
shoes. The complete article is available at:
<http://www.aphis.usda.gov/vs/ceah/cei/travrisk.pdf> in pdf format.
FMDV is very hardy. It survives freezing temperatures, and has also been
found to be viable in contaminated milk after pasteurization at 72 degrees
C for 15 seconds (Pirtle 1991). The virus can survive for extended periods
outside the host in protected locations. FMDV has been recovered from
cattle stalls 14 days after removal of infected cattle, from urine after 39
days, from soil after 28 days in autumn and after 3 days in summer, and
from dry hay at 22 degrees C after 20 weeks storage (Pirtle 1991). The
virus is rendered inactive by sunlight, extremes of pH, and high temperatures.
Humans can play a role in the transmission of FMDV. The virus can be
carried by people for up to approximately 14 days after contact with the
disease. People can inhale the virus, trapping it in the respiratory tract
for as long as 36 hours (Hyslop 1973). The virus can then be expelled in
the saliva or breath, and become a source of infection to susceptible animals.

[Picornaviruses by the nature of their structure tend to be
resistant. FMDV is distinctive in its extreme acid lability, being
unstable below pH 6.8. Hence, the virus is rapidly inactivated in muscle
tissue after slaughter of infected animals. - Mod.CP
