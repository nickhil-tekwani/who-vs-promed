When anthrax struck a Kolar village
--------------------------------------------
Even as concern over the possibility of biological attack by terrorists
using anthrax bacteria looms large the world over, a more natural form of
the disease has caught the local people of Alagurke village in Siddlagatta
taluk of Kolar district unawares. Alagurke is a small remote village located
55 km from Kolar with a population of about 200 and coming under the
Thimmanayakanahalli gram panchayat. A narrow mud-path of 2 km from the
Chintamani-Siddlagatta road is the sole way to reach the village.
When this correspondent visited Alagurke following reports of an "anthrax
outbreak" by the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD), he
found the villagers were yet to come to terms with what actually is lurking
among them. According to NICD, 2 persons from the village died of anthrax
which also killed hordes of sheep and cattle.Interestingly, the villagers
refuse to believe that anthrax is the cause of the deaths. Some even denied
that there had been any deaths in the village. Little probing revealed that
2 persons indeed had died due to some "infections," but the cause of death
at that time was not known.
It all started during the first week of August when sheep started developing
bleeding wounds and succumbed to them within a few days. As many as 20
sheep, an ox and 2 cows died within 2 days. "It was a terrible loss for
us. We were all heavily dependent on them for our living," says Nanjamma, a
resident of the village.
Anthrax in the village first came to light when [a 49 year-old man
suddenly developed swelling on his left hand. "First we took him for
treatment at a local hospital in Chintamani. The doctors here failed to
diagnose the problem and referred him to the R L Jalappa Hospital in
Kolar", says a brother of [the man. "A lot of pus had formed in his hand
and it had swelled twice the size overnight. We began to realise something
was drastically wrong." At the R L Jalappa Hospital, the study of the
infection confirmed it to be due to _Bacillus anthracis_. Blood samples
sent to NICD confirmed the same. Today, [the patient is recovering after a
surgery performed by a team of doctors of the hospital.
With the confirmation of anthrax, the district health office and veterinary
department immediately set into motion and started vaccinating the animals
and cautioning the villagers to stop eating their meat. While the outbreak
has been contained, awareness among the villagers regarding the dreaded
disease is almost nil. Anthrax for them is only a new terminology and
nothing more.
[The patient was infected when an open wound on his hand came in contact with
the blood of an infected sheep while slaughtering.
Outbreaks of anthrax occur every year in India and some people catch it from
infected animals or eating their meat. The 2 "deaths" in Alagurke are
suspected to be due to villagers catching the infection by consuming the
meat of animals that died of anthrax.
When contacted health department officials in Kolar said that precautionary
measures have been taken to prevent any further spread of the disease.
Vaccination of animals in Siddalaghatta, Bagepalli, Srinivaspura and
Chikkabalapur is being taken up. Medicines are being supplied to meet any
eventualities, they said. Experts point out that anthrax occurs in livestock
in India because animal vaccination is poor. But what worries them is the
rare and far more fatal form of anthrax transmitted through spores that can
be sprayed from a plane or soaked in a filter paper and sent by post, a
killer weapon in biological warfare.

[This would appear to be a continuation of a series of outbreaks that we
reported recently. Then the authorities were responding or that was the
local report. It is clear that a regular programme of vaccination and
surveillance is needed if any meaningful impact is going to be made on this
disease by the Indian authorities. The area is some 60 kms NNE of Bangalore.
The Indian journalist's fear of bioterrorism is an extraordinary example of
misplaced fears when the disease is regularly occurring down the road.
Hand lesions are a routine result of skinning out animals that have died of
anthrax and are not uncommon in Southern India. Why he was operated upon is
obscure to me. These hand lesions respond well to antibiotic treatment. A
colleague in Peru has pointed out that I forgot to specifically mention the
black eschars that form with cutaneous lesions. This is a classic
pathognemonic tissue response but is not always seen in the early stages.
