An outbreak of mumps involving University of Idaho Moscow [Latah County, Idaho] students is leading public health officials to urge students to use the upcoming holiday break to check their vaccination records to make certain they are current for the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination before they return for classes. As of Wednesday [19 Nov 2014], 10 laboratory-confirmed cases of mumps have been reported, with over 20 additional reports being investigated, including 2 in the Moscow community.

The MMR vaccine is the best way to prevent mumps. Students who have not previously had mumps or who have no record of any doses of MMR vaccine should receive 2 doses at least 28 days apart; students who received only 1 dose of MMR vaccine should receive a 2nd dose. Students can check with the University of Idaho Student Health Services, their primary care provider, local public health office or a local pharmacy about receiving an MMR vaccine.

Mumps is a contagious virus that spreads from person-to-person via droplets of saliva or mucus from the mouth, nose, or throat of an infected person, usually when the person coughs, sneezes, or talks. An infected person can spread the virus before being sick. The virus is also spread when someone with mumps touches items or surfaces without washing their hands, and then someone else touches the same item or surface and rubs their mouth or nose. Symptoms, which can appear up to 25 days after being exposed, may include fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen or tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides of the head. The most common complication of mumps infection in adults is testicular inflammation. Rare complications include meningitis, encephalitis, inflammation of the ovaries, and deafness. Anyone experiencing symptoms compatible with mumps should contact their health care professional. Up to half of people with mumps have very mild or no symptoms and might not know they are infected.

Anyone infected with the mumps virus should stay home for 5 days after symptoms begin, while minimizing close contact with other people. Infected people should avoid sharing drinks or eating utensils, cover all coughs and sneezes, wash their hands frequently with soap and water, and regularly clean frequently touched surfaces.

Nevertheless, mumps outbreaks even among vaccinated populations have been reported frequently during recent years, especially among college students where the intensity of exposure among students was presumed to have overcome the vaccine-induced immunity (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/4/13-1681_article.htm).

The American College Health Association has recommended that colleges and universities require that students have documented receipt of 2 doses of MMR vaccine or have other acceptable evidence of measles, rubella, and mumps immunity before enrollment (http://www.acha.org/topics/docs/CDC_ACHA_Mumps_Recommendations_Jul13.pdf). Immune globulin is not effective postexposure prophylaxis (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/mumps.pdf). In an outbreak setting, MMR vaccine might reduce transmission to susceptible persons not yet exposed to the mumps virus. The CDC has evaluated use of a 3rd dose of MMR vaccine for mumps outbreak control during 2 previous mumps outbreaks in which transmission was sustained, despite high 2-dose coverage (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6148a2.htm). During both outbreaks, targeted vaccination was followed by a decrease in mumps incidence among the target group.

Moscow is a college town, with 23 800 residents in 2010 census, in the U.S. state of Idaho near the state's western border with Washington State. The University of Idaho campus is adjacent to the southwest side of town, with about 11 000 students housed in 4 residence halls, as well as 27 fraternity and sorority houses (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Idaho).
