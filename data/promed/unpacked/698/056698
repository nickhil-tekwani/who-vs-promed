An increase in canine distemper infection in raccoons and foxes has
veterinarians worried that the disease could spread to pet dogs and to
shelters such as the operation at Alachua County Animal Services,
officials said.

Veterinarians fear a recurrence of a distemper outbreak that killed
more than 600 dogs in Alachua County 3 years ago. "We tested 5 sick
raccoons and one fox, and all of them came back positive for canine
distemper" said Julie Levy, director of Maddie's Shelter Medicine
Program at the University of Florida (UF), College of Veterinary
Medicine. "This is frightening because distemper is extremely
infectious to dogs and has a high fatality rate."

Levy said the 6 animals that were tested were just a few of those the
county has caught and euthanized recently.

Alachua County Animal Services Director David Flagler said precautions
are being taken at the shelter to prevent an outbreak there. Flagler
added dog owners also need to be careful to keep their pets from
having contact with wildlife or excretions from wildlife to prevent
the disease. Dogs should be vaccinated against distemper.

"I mapped the 6 weeks of data and the (infected animals) seem to be
pretty much skewed all over the county. It seems to be such a
widespread epidemic with these critters," Flagler said. "In these
rough economic times people are finding ways to cut back.
Unfortunately many people are cutting back on the vaccination of their
pets. If their dogs come into contact with where a raccoon left
slobber, their dogs are at risk."

A sudden increase in residents reporting raccoons seen during daylight
hours with neurological signs alerted animal control officers to the
problem. After rabies tests came back negative, Flagler called in the
UF shelter medicine program for help.

Infected raccoons are a frequent source of spreading distemper to
susceptible dogs. When infected dogs are brought into intensive dog
housing facilities such as animal shelters, the disease can spread
throughout the facility, especially among vulnerable populations such
as puppies, Levy said.

Recent outbreaks of distemper in Orange, Brevard, and Pasco counties
have killed hundreds of dogs that were not current on vaccinations.

"So far, we have not seen any evidence of transmission to dogs in our
shelter," said county shelter veterinarian Randy Caligiuri. "The staff
remembers the outbreak in 2007 and is very careful to vaccinate all
dogs at admission and to avoid any contamination from the sick
wildlife."

Canine distemper is a virus that affects both domestic and wild canine
species, ferrets, and raccoons. The virus attacks the respiratory,
intestinal and neurological systems.

Levy said initial tests were done for rabies because distemper in
wildlife has signs similar to rabies, such as staggering and seizures.
"Distemper in dogs usually presents more with pneumonia -- runny nose,
runny eyes -- and seizures," Levy said. "The vaccine works very well.
When dogs have been vaccinated they will be immune for many, many
years."

Signs of distemper
------------------
Dogs typically have runny nose and eyes, respiratory infection,
seizures. Wild animals will have staggering and twitching. Aggression
-- a sign of rabies -- is not a sign of distemper.

Prognosis
---------
For dogs, the fatality rate for distemper is about 50 percent. It is
more fatal in puppies than adult dogs. Treatment is generally
antibiotics. Some dogs that do survive have long-lasting neurological
problems that must be controlled with medication.

[As this article points out, the clinical signs of rabies in raccoons
vs those of distemper in raccoons are very different. Raccoons with
distemper are not aggressive, but may have trouble walking or even
staying in a tree. On the other hand, raccoons with rabies are very
aggressive.

While there are 2 types of rabies, one being aggressive (the furious
form) and one being very passive (the dumb form), the passive form is
seldom seen in raccoons.

Vaccinating your pets against rabies and distemper is very important.
Pet care and personal health care are not areas to cut back on in
times of economic down turn. - Mod.TG]
