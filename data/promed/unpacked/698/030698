The Democratic Republic of Congo is bogged by outbreaks of cholera, measles, and the worst yellow fever in 30 years. Funds are insufficient to control the crises.

In March 2016, a yellow fever outbreak was declared after 39 cases were reported imported from neighbouring Angola. There have been 3625 suspected cases of yellow fever, of which 876 are confirmed, with 357 deaths.

In light of epidemics, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has launched an emergency appeal, calling for more than 2 million Swiss francs [USD 2 028 000] to support activities in response to outbreaks.

The emergency appeal aims to provide assistance to more than 12 million people with interventions on emergency health, water, sanitation and hygiene promotion.

[If the number of suspected yellow fever (YF) cases given above is accurate, that number has doubled in the past 2 weeks. A vaccination campaign is currently underway, and a much larger effort is scheduled in August [2016] when a new shipment of YF vaccine is expected. Given the increase in suspected cases, this larger effort is increasingly urgent.
