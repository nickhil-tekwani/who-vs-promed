Liberia: Rapid Response Launched by WHO and UNICEF to Contain Yellow Fever
Emergency
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MONROVIA/GENEVA: International health agencies announced on Tue 24 Feb 2004
that they were joining forces with the Liberian government to combat
ayellow fever emergency. The World Health Organization and UNICEF
arelaunching an emergency mass immunization campaign together with
Liberias Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. The UN agencies appealed
today for US$ 1.3 million to help contain the outbreak and keep it from
exploding to larger populations in displaced persons camps and urban areas.
"Conditions are ripe here for an epidemic," said Dr. Luzitu Simao, of WHO
in Liberia "The last 14 years of civil war have literally destroyed
Liberias health infrastructure and yellow fever is an extremely deadly
disease. Even among hospitalized patients, the mortality rate may reach up
to 50%."
"WHO considers just one laboratory confirmed case to be an outbreak and we
already have three confirmed cases and several suspected cases are
undergoing laboratory analysis at the Pasteur Institute in Abidjan, Côte
d'Ivoire" he added. The three confirmed cases and two of the suspected
cases have died.
UNICEF said fewer than 80 000 vaccination doses were currently available in
Liberia. They estimated that 522 000 people above six months of age were in
need of urgent vaccination. UNICEF and WHO estimate that it will cost US$
1.3 million to control the outbreak. The funds will cover vaccines,
injection materials, operational costs and the strengthening of
epidemiological surveillance and public awareness.
Liberia lies in the yellow fever belt of West Africa and at least six
outbreaks of the disease were reported between 1995 and 2002. Yellow fever
is a viral haemorrhagic disease transmitted by mosquitoes, either from
monkey to human, or human to human. The civil war in Liberia sparked
massive movements of people from rural areas, where yellow fever is
endemic, to crowded urban areas creating ideal conditions for transmission
of the disease. Some 500 000 people are internally displaced, living in
squalid camps or in the ruins of abandoned buildings, with extremely poor
sanitation. Environmental conditions will become even more favourable for
the disease with the onset of the rainy season in April.
The vaccination campaign will first target Bong and Nimba counties, which
border Guinea and Côte dIvoire respectively. For more information contact:
