_Naegleria fowleri_ is now back in the news because of the death of a 21 year old Inyo County, California woman. What's your real risk of getting infected from this amoeba?

Epidemiology
------------
In the past 10 years, only 35 naegleria infections were reported in the United States. In the last 50 years, [128] people died from this infection; only 3 survived. In contrast, a recent cluster in Karachi, Pakistan, has just claimed it's 8th victim within the past few weeks.

This parasite is found in fresh water, so most people become infected after swimming in lakes, especially in the South, where the water is warmer. Sadly, infection was linked to backyard kiddie wading pools in Arizona. One was infected via a backyard slip-n-slide. One baby, an "8 month old infant is thought to have acquired an infection with _N. fowleri_ during a full-submersion baptism ceremony in a natural body of water."

Other people became infected following nasal irrigation (Neti pot) using contaminated tap water. This is a common treatment for chronic sinus infections, and is also used as ablution in some religious rituals. A cluster related to Neti pots prompted the Food and Drug Administration to issue a warning to use sterile water for the saline nasal irrigations. Naegleria is not contracted by drinking contaminated water, nor is it spread from person to person. You only get it when infected water is snuffed up the nose.

Two other amoeba also cause infections in people. Acanthamoeba is most associated with causing severe eye infections (keratitis) in contact lens wearers. There was a significant outbreak in 2007 felt to be due to contamination during use, rather than the lens solution being intrinsically contaminated. The other amoebic pathogen is _Balamuthia mandrillaris_, which can also causes encephalitis. It can be acquired through the nose or by breaks in the skin.

Primary amebic meningoencephalitis from free living amoeba including _Naegleria fowleri_ and others are ubiquitous, and sporadic cases are seen after contact with fresh water during warm weather. Lately, ProMED-mail has reported a series of cases from Pakistan, which seems to be related to nasal irrigation with contaminated water (see postings listed below). - Mod.EP
