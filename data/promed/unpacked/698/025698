Long COVID symptoms affect 1 in 8 adults, some for 2 years
----------------------------------------------------------
Three new studies report on long-COVID symptoms and medical conditions in adults and children, with the 1st finding that 1 in 8 adults experiences lingering symptoms; another detailing new cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic findings in children; and a third finding persistent loss of taste and smell after 2 years.

12.7% report long-COVID symptoms
--------------------------------
An observational study from the Netherlands in The Lancet analyzed the nature, prevalence, and severity of long-COVID symptoms in 4231 adult COVID-19 survivors and 8462 matched controls 3 to 5 months after infection or matched date, before the COVID-19 vaccine rollout in that country. [Aranka V Ballering, Sander K R van Zon, Tim C olde Hartman, Judith G M Rosmalen. Persistence of somatic symptoms after COVID-19 in the Netherlands: an observational cohort study. The Lancet. Published: 6 Aug 2022 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01214-4]

The authors used data from Lifelines, a prospective, population-based cohort study on the health and health-related behaviors of the Dutch population. All adult participants were invited to complete the same online questionnaire 24 times on 23 physical long-COVID symptoms after recovery from infection with the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant or previously circulating strains from 31 Mar 2020 to 2 Aug 2021. Average participant age was 53.7 years, and 60.8% were women.

COVID-19 survivors reported chest pain, shortness of breath, painful breathing and muscles, loss of taste or smell, tingling and heaviness of the arms and legs, a lump in the throat, feeling hot and then cold, and fatigue at 3 to 5 months.

Of all patients, 12.7% had symptoms attributable to COVID-19, and 381 of 1782 survivors (21.4%) and 361 of 4130 (8.7%) of controls reported that at least one symptom became at least moderately severe by 3 months, then usually plateaued. Other symptoms, including headache, itchy eyes, dizziness, back pain, and nausea, did not become more severe.

In a Lancet press release, senior author Judith Rosmalen, of the University of Groningen, said that data on the scale and scope of long-COVID symptoms are urgently needed. "However, most previous research into long COVID have not looked at the frequency of these symptoms in people who haven't been diagnosed with COVID-19 or looked at individual patients' symptoms before the diagnosis of COVID-19," she said. [https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/960682]

First author Aranka Ballering, also at Groningen, said that the team was able to account for symptoms unrelated to infection but related to the pandemic overall, such as stress caused by lockdowns and uncertainty. "These core symptoms have major implications for future research, as these symptoms can be used to distinguish between post COVID-19 condition and non-COVID-19-related symptoms," she said.

In a related commentary, Christopher Brightling and Rachael Evans, both of the University of Leicester in the United Kingdom, said that some symptoms reported in the study, such as fatigue and shortness of breath, were similar to those cited in previous research. [Christopher E Brightling & Rachael A Evans. Long COVID: which symptoms can be attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection? The Lancet. Comment. vol 400, issue 10350, P411-413, 06 Aug 2022. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(22)01385-X] "But interestingly other symptoms such as chest pain were more a feature in those with long COVID versus uninfected controls," they wrote. "Current evidence supports the view that long COVID is common and can persist for at least 2 years, although severe debilitating disease is present in a minority."

Infected kids had twice rate of heart disorders
-----------------------------------------------
In a study published today [5 Aug 2022] in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), researchers with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) COVID-19 Emergency Response Team evaluated 9 persistent signs and symptoms and 15 conditions thought to be related to COVID-19 in 781 419 previously infected US children and 2 344 257 uninfected controls aged 0 to 17 years from 1 Mar 2020 to 31 Jan 2022. Follow-up was 60 to 365 days or until the end of the study. [Kompaniyets L, Bull-Otterson L, Boehmer TK, et al. Post-COVID-19 Symptoms and Conditions Among Children and Adolescents -- United States, 1 Mar 2020-31 Jan 2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 2022;71:993-999. DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm7131a3]

Median age of all participants was 12 years, and those not infected with COVID-19 had higher rates of previous hospitalization and complex chronic disease than infected patients (4.5% and 15.6% vs 3.6% and 11.7%, respectively).

After COVID-19 infection, children had higher rates of acute pulmonary embolism (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.01), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (inflammation of the heart muscle and enlarged heart, respectively) (aHR, 1.99), venous blood clots (aHR, 1.87), acute and unspecified kidney failure (aHR, 1.32), type 1 diabetes (aHR, 1.23), coagulation and hemorrhagic disorders (aHR, 1.18), type 2 diabetes (aHR, 1.17), and abnormal heart rhythms (aHR, 1.16).

But relative to controls, COVID-19 survivors had lower odds of respiratory signs and symptoms (aHR, 0.91), mental symptoms (aHR, 0.91), muscle disorders (aHR, 0.94), neurologic conditions (aHR, 0.94), anxiety and fear-related disorders (aHR, 0.85), mood disorders (aHR, 0.78), and sleep problems (aHR, 0.91).

Compared with controls, infected children aged 2 to 4 years were at higher risk for myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (aHR, 2.39), acute and unspecified kidney failure (aHR, 1.52), and coagulation and hemorrhagic disorders (aHR, 1.47). This age-group was the only one with elevated rates of post-COVID asthma (aHR, 1.12) and respiratory signs and symptoms (aHR, 1.07).

COVID-19 survivors in the 5 to 11-year age-group were at higher risk than controls for myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (aHR, 2.84), venous blood clots (aHR, 2.69), and acute and unspecified kidney failure (aHR, 1.38). And infected patients aged 12 to 17 were at higher risk than controls for blood clots in the lungs (aHR, 2.03), myocarditis and cardiomyopathy (aHR, 1.66), and venous blood clots (aHR, 1.52).

"These findings can be used to apprise health care professionals and caregivers about new symptoms and conditions that occur among children and adolescents in the months after SARS-CoV-2 infection," the authors wrote. "COVID-19 prevention strategies, including vaccination for all eligible children and adolescents, are critical to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent illness, including post-COVID symptoms and conditions."

12.8% still hadn't recovered smell, taste at 2 years
----------------------------------------------------
In JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery yesterday [4 Aug 2022], researchers in Italy and the United Kingdom assessed adults diagnosed as having COVID-19 at a general hospital from 19 to 22 Mar 2020. A total of 168 respondents completed symptom questionnaires at 4 and 8 weeks, 6 months, and 2 years. Median patient age was 55 years, and 53.6% were women. [Paolo Boscolo-Rizzo, Cristoforo Fabbris, Jerry Polesel, et al. Two-year prevalence and recovery rate of altered sense of smell or taste in patients with mildly symptomatic COVID-19. JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. Published online 4 Aug 2022. doi:10.1001/jamaoto.2022.1983]

Of the 168 patients, 64.3% reported altered taste or smell at baseline, as did 64.3% at 4 weeks, 17.3% at 8 weeks, 16.1% at 6 months, and 8.3% at 2 years. The altered senses were first observed at 4-week follow-up in 11 patients who still tested positive for COVID-19.

Thirteen patients (10.9%) reported recovery of taste or smell at least 6 months after diagnosis. At 2 years, 47 patients (28.0%) reported at least one persistent symptom. The commonest symptoms unrelated to taste or smell were fatigue (18.5%) and shortness of breath (10.7%).

Of the 119 patients with smell or taste dysfunction at 4 weeks, 88.2% reported complete resolution at 2 years, 9.2% said their impairment was less severe, and 2.5% said their symptom was the same or worse.

While warning that the results should be interpreted with caution owing to study limitations, the researchers said, "Contrary to what is often reported, patients should be reassured that recovery from smell or taste impairment may continue for many months after the onset. These results apply to patients infected in the pre-omicron period. COVID-19 driven by the SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant has been indeed observed to less frequently and less severely affect chemosensory function."

[2] Virus in exhaled breath

ref: Jianyu Lai, Kristen K Coleman, S-H Sheldon Tai, et al. Evolution of SARS-CoV-2 Shedding in Exhaled Breath Aerosols. MedRxiv. 1 Aug 2022.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract
--------
Aerosol inhalation is increasingly well recognized as a major if not primary mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2(1,2). Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, 3 highly transmissible lineages evolved and became globally dominant(3). One hypothesis to explain increased transmissibility is that natural selection favours variants with higher rates of viral aerosol shedding. However, the extent of aerosol shedding of successive SARS-CoV-2 variants is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that viral shedding (measured as RNA copies) into exhaled breath aerosol was significantly greater during infections with alpha, delta, and omicron than with ancestral strains and variants not associated with increased transmissibility. The 3 highly transmissible variants independently evolved a high viral aerosol shedding phenotype, demonstrating convergent evolution. We did not observe statistically significant differences in rates of shedding between alpha, delta, and omicron infections. The highest shedder in our study, however, had an omicron infection and shed 3 orders of magnitude more viral RNA copies than the maximum observed for delta and alpha(4). Our results also show that fully vaccinated and boosted individuals, when infected, can shed infectious SARSV-2 via exhaled breath aerosols. These findings provide additional evidence that inhalation of infectious aerosols is the dominant mode of transmission and emphasize the importance of ventilation, filtration, and air disinfection to mitigate the pandemic and protect vulnerable populations. We anticipate that monitoring aerosol shedding from new SARS-CoV-2 variants and emerging pathogens will be an important component of future threat assessments and will help guide interventions to prevent transmission via inhalation exposure.

[Summary of paper by author Kristen K Coleman]
Here, we:
1) report rates of SARS2 shedding into exhaled breath aerosol (EBA) by individuals with delta and omicron infections,
2) compare viral EBA shedding rates among omicron subvariants, and
3) describe evolving rate of viral EBA shedding over the 1st 2 years of the pandemic.
From June 2020 through March 2022, we used the G-II machine to collect and measure viral load in EBA of 93 volunteers recruited from a university community.

Mildly symptomatic (97%; 1-13 days post-onset) or asymptomatic (3%) at time of sampling. We also collected saliva, mid-turbinate swabs (MTS), phone swabs, & blood samples. ...

Participants enrolled from September 2021-March 2022 had an active delta or omicron infection, were fully vaccinated (63% boosted), and had detectable IgG against SARS2 spike RBD. The majority (66%) shed detectable levels of SARS2 RNA into aerosols.

Viral RNA loads in coarse (> 5μm) and fine (≤ 5μm) aerosol size fractions ranged from non-detect to 1.8 x 10^5 and non-detect to 1.8 x 10e7 copies per 30-min EBA sample, respectively.

Infectious (culture+) SARS2 was recovered from the exhaled breath aerosol of 2 delta and 2 omicron (both with BA.1.1, one boosted) cases.

One of the culture+ EBA samples was from the coarse aerosol size fraction, while the remaining 3 culture+ EBA samples were from the fine aerosol size fraction.

The culture+ coarse EBA sample was from a participant with a delta infection.

Surprisingly, we observed no significant difference in viral aerosol shedding rates between omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, and BA.2. This is puzzling as BA.2 was estimated to be 30-40% more transmissible than BA.1, and no display of enhanced antibody escape relative to BA.1.

BA.2 does have increased competence for replication in human nasal and bronchial tissues, but so far this change does not appear to impact average viral aerosol shedding rates among vaxxed/boosted with BA.2 breakthroughs.

Story could be different for BA.2.12.1 and BA.4/5.

Now, onto the evolving rate of SARS2 aerosol shedding over the course of the 1st 2 years of the pandemic, which provides more evidence that aerosol transmission (inhalation of SARS2) is the dominant mode of transmission: when compared to SARS2 ancestral strains and variants not associated with increased transmissibility, viral EBA shedding was significantly greater during infections with alpha, delta, and omicron. This would suggest that the 3 highly transmissible VOCs (alpha, delta, and omicron) independently evolved a high viral aerosol shedding phenotype, demonstrating convergent evolution. To my knowledge, this is the best human subject research data we have on how emerging viruses can adapt to transmit more efficiently through aerosols. Scientists anticipate this to happen (in theory) but collectively, as a society, we lack this foresight when preparing for PHEICs

Back to omicron. Although we did not observe statistically significant differences in rates of shedding between alpha, delta, and omicron, the highest shedder was an omicron case that shed 3 orders of magnitude more viral RNA copies than the max observed for delta and alpha. This could mean that omicron has a higher propensity for supershedding, which could not be predicted by its relatively low viral load in the nasal cavity. Remember when omicron 1st emerged & resulted in a huge superspreader event at a dinner party? And then that kept happening?

We show that infected persons shed infectious SARS2 aerosols even when fully vaxxed/boosted. A combo of immune evasive properties and high viral aerosol shedding were likely responsible for omicron's ascent and replacement of delta, even as infection- and vaccine-acquired immunity increased. Notably, the geometric mean RNA copy number in exhaled breath aerosol was 2 orders of magnitude *less* than previously observed for symptomatic influenza cases. Thus, future SARS2 variants with even higher viral aerosol shedding rates may yet arise.

A pharmaceutical-only approach is not currently the best public health approach to combat COVID. Interventions that disrupt airborne transmission are needed. At this time, these include indoor air ventilation, filtration, air disinfection with germicidal UV, and high-quality masks.
