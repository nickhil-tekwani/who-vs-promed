The Lagos State Ministry of Health yesterday [8 Apr 2017] refuted media reports alleging that 2 deaths attributed to meningitis have been recorded in the state. The commissioner for health, Dr Jide Idris, while reviewing the activities of the state government with regards to curtailing and controlling the spread of the meningitis epidemic in press statement dismissed the report as false, capable of causing undue panic among the citizenry. "The report carried by some newspapers and online platforms is untrue and does not represent the reality of the situation in Lagos State as at today", he said.

For the avoidance of doubt, there are 2 main types of meningitis. The epidemic-prone meningitis, which is referred to as cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) is caused by a bacterium called _Neisseria meningitidis_ and its occurrence is seasonal or cyclical depending on the level of herd immunity and climatic conditions. The 2nd type of meningitis is non-epidemic meningitis. This type of meningitis is usually caused by a virus or other bacteria, but not by _N. meningitidis_. The non-epidemic meningitis occurs without any seasonal pattern or periodicity.

Idris also disclosed that though the disease surveillance notification officer [for] Lagos Island Local Government reported 9 suspected cases of meningitis from Massey Street Children Hospital in week 13 of this year [week ending 31 Mar 2017] with 2 deaths, none of these was confirmed as due to the causative agent of CSM. He further revealed that though all the 9 cases presented with clinical features of meningitis at the said hospital but laboratory tests proved that they were either due to _Haemophilus influenzae_ or _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ and not _N. meningitidis_.

Idris, in addition, said that the Ministry of Health was also notified last week of a 3 year old boy presenting clinically as meningitis at a registered private facility in Lagos but the laboratory investigations did not confirm CSM. According to him, "the blood culture yielded no growth but the urine culture yielded klebsiella and not meningococcus. The patient is already responding to treatment." Idris affirmed that "none of these cases presented with a history of recent travel to any area with an outbreak of meningitis and neither were visits from such areas recorded with the aforementioned cases."

Idris seized the opportunity to reiterate the Lagos State government's firm resolve to prevent and control the spread of the epidemic to the state. He then urged the people of the state to support governmental effort by reporting suspected cases to the nearest public health facility or call the following lines 08037170614, 08023169485. The commissioner stressed the need for the observance of a high standard of personal and environmental hygiene as a preventive measure against the outbreak of the disease noting that such hygiene measures should include washing of hands with soap and water frequently and thoroughly, avoiding direct contact with the discharges from an infected person and covering of mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing.

"It is strongly advised for people to avoid overcrowding in living quarters, provide cross ventilation in sleeping and work-rooms and other places where many people come together and get vaccinated with CSM vaccine when you are travelling to areas where meningitis outbreaks have been reported," he added. Idris noted that health workers in the state have already been placed on red alert on the disease and surveillance teams consisting of epidemiologists are also intensifying their surveillance and monitoring activities.

"Health workers are also advised to avoid close and prolonged contacts with suspected and probable cases of CSM, ensure proper disposal of respiratory and throat secretions of cases, report suspected or probable cases and observe universal precaution and make use of personal protective equipment when in contact with such cases. There is no need to panic. We will continue with our surveillance activities, constantly review our records and brief the public from time to time," he added.

[The usual pathogen in the African meningitis belt during the dry season has been _Neisseria meningitidis_. However, some studies have emphasized that _Streptococcus pneumoniae_ may cause outbreaks of bacterial meningitis in an epidemic pattern in the African meningitis belt during the dry season (https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/43/6/701/326807/Pneumococcal-Meningitis-Epidemics-in-Africa, http://jid.oxfordjournals.org/content/192/2/192.abstract, and http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/6/693.abstract). _S. pneumoniae_ serotype 1 from a single clonal complex (ST 217) has predominated in several outbreaks, but other pneumococcal serotypes are also isolated. The case fatality rate for pneumococcal meningitis has been high; over 40 per cent of cases are fatal, regardless of age group.

Maps of Nigeria can be seen at http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/nigeria.pdf and https://promedmail.org/promed-post?place=4961260,617. Lagos, a western coastal city in the Nigerian state of Lagos, with an estimated population in the city and adjoining areas of 16 million residents, is the largest in Nigeria, as well as on the African continent (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagos). Western coastal Nigeria lies within the African meningitis belt (http://img.static.reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/A592137EAFA85677C1256F2D0047FD68-af_menen.jpg). - Mod.ML]
