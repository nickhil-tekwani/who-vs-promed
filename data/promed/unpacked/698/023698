Lassa fever
Sierra Leone. Lassa fever re-emerged as a public health
problem in Kenema in eastern Sierra Leone during 1996.
>From January to 19 April 1996, 799 cases with 148 deaths
(CFR 18.5%) were reported. In the endemic Lassa fever
situation an annual average of 40-50 cases normally occurred
in this region. An elevated number of Lassa fever cases has
continued to occur in 1997, with 45 cases reported in
January, 75 in February and 147 in March. The increased
occurrence is closely related to massive population
movements with subsequent crowding, poor sanitation, unsafe
food handling and storage practices combined with an
increase in the rat population. Furthermore, with the
improving political and security situation in Sierra Leone,
the populace is moving about more freely to access health
care facilities resulting in increased case reporting.
The Ministry of Health, WHO, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, USA and MERLIN, United Kingdom have worked
together to monitor the outbreak and to mitigate its impact.
Patients are brought to and treated at an isolation ward
established in Kenema which has been expanded to accommodate
the increase in cases. Several workshops have been held to
train health staff and to educate the general public about
measures to avoid contact with rodents.
Supplies of
ribavirin, the antiviral drug used to treat Lassa virus
infections, were nearly depleted. The Red Cross was
contacted regarding this need and the Chinese Red Cross
responded with a donation of 120,000 doses of the drug to
the Government of Sierra Leone. WHO is working with the
pharmaceutical industry on a long-term solution.
(Based on a report from WHO representative in Sierra Leone.)
WHO Comment: Transmission of the Lassa virus in the community is
mainly due to contact with rats of the genus Mastomys.
Infected rats continually shed viruses in their urine and
humans are infected by ingestion of food contaminated with
rat urine or inhalation of virus-containing aerosols.
Minimizing contact with rodents by the safe handling and
storage of food, and restricting access of rats to homes,
remain therefore the most effective preventive measures.

Person-to-person transmission occurs primarily in health
care institutions caring for Lassa patients. Nosocomial
spread can easily be prevented by managing patients in
isolation wards and with appropriate protective measures
(barrier nursing).
The risk of transmission during
international travel is low unless the traveller is in
contact with a severely ill and bleeding case. A recent
incident involving a virus which causes a similar clinical
syndrome occurred in South Africa where a nurse was infected
with Ebola virus while caring for a patient from an endemic
area. This underscores the importance of health care staff
awareness and use of special precautions when treating
patients who have travelled abroad.

In regard to this posting, I would take issue with the last sentence and
suggest that it read: "This underscores the importance of the use of
standard barrier
precautions with all patients, which are sufficient to prevent the
transmission of Lassa Fever Virus and other blood- and body-fluid-borne agents
without the need for special isolation precautions (which reinforce the
misperception that hemorrhagic fever viruses are transmissible to a greater
extent than other bloodborne viruses). In areas where standard precautions are
not routinely used, special precautions may be appropriate for suspected
hemorrhagic fever virus patients but should not substitute for continuing
efforts to educate healthcare workers in these areas on the need for use of
standard (i.e. universal) precautions."
