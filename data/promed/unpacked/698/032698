Three new outbreaks of foot and mouth disease confirmed in Brazil
---------------------------------------------
SAO PAULO - Authorities in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul
confirmed 3 new cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) on Monday, which
raises the total number of outbreaks to 14. Two of the recent cases are
localized in the south eastern city of Rio Grande, while the third case is
located more to the west, in Quarai, near the border with Uruguay,
according to the Department of Agriculture.
While all of the recent cases are in the southern border regions, this does
not decrease fears [that this contagious virus may travel north toward the
neighboring state of Santa Catarina. Last week, the authorities succeeded
in containing the disease in the frontier regions with Uruguay and
Argentina, by removal of the infected herds. But last Thursday, 45 heads of
infected cattle were discovered in one ranch situated very much to the
north [of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, some 250 kilometers from Santa
Catarina. The government has already [destroyed some 600 cattle and will
[kill 300 more soon. In addition, they have initiated a massive
vaccination campaign to cover 13 million heads of cattle in the state.
