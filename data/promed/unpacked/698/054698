Producers affected by coffee rust
---------------------------------
Coffee producers have lost 70 per cent of their crops due to the effects of the coffee rust disease [which] impacts on 400 000 national producers, said the National Agricultural and Coffee Organizations Alliance [NACOA] and the National Coordinator of Coffee Organizations.

In 2 years, the coffee rust disease has devastated more than half of coffee plantations in Chiapas [ProMED-mail post 20140128.2236486], Guerrero, and Oaxaca. The plague has spread to the state of Veracruz, where production has also decreased.

Marcelo Herrera, NACOA, said it is necessary to have a strong policy by the National Service for Agro-Food Safety and Quality. He added that Mexico still does not have a plan to fight [coffee rust].

[Coffee leaf rust (CLR; also called orange rust) is caused by the fungus _Hemileia vastatrix_, one of the most feared pathogens of the crop. Of the 2 coffee species grown commercially, _Coffea arabica_ (arabica or highland coffee) and _C. canephora_ (robusta or lowland coffee), it affects only arabica varieties, which are usually preferred for their taste. The rust has completely destroyed coffee industries in several countries. The disease is characterised by yellow-orange powdery lesions on the underside of leaves, where it attacks through stomata, but it rarely occurs on stems or fruit. CLR can lead to complete defoliation with death of the host plant.

Fungal spores are spread by wind, rain, and mechanical means. Disease management relies mainly on multiple fungicide applications during the rainy season. Rust-resistant cultivars exist, but the crop is generally of poorer quality. More than 30 races of the fungus have been detected, making it particularly difficult to establish durable host resistance.

The emergence in Central America of a new fungal strain adapted to higher altitude conditions, which may also show additional fungicide resistances, is making CLR control in the region considerably more difficult. The current outbreak in the region (ProMED-mail post 20140604.2518313) is regarded as one of the most severe attacks of the fungus on record worldwide.

In 2014, the new high altitude strain was identified for the first time in Mexico in the state of Chiapas (ProMED-mail post 20140128.2236486). It may be the cause of the problems reported above.

A new more aggressive leaf rust strain is also suspected to be emerging in Colombia (see ProMED-mail posts 20100526.1745, 20091008.3490, and 20090225.0773) and information on the strain(s) involved in an outbreak in Jamaica is still lacking.
