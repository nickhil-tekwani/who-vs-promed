The latest numbers for the Zika fever outbreak in the 2 French, Pacific island territories were released today [28 Feb 2014] by the ECDC and here is the update:

In French Polynesia, 61 new suspected cases were recorded during the last week bringing the number of suspected cases to 8503. One additional case of Guillain-Barre syndrome has been reported since the last update. There have been 74 cases of neurological and autoimmune complications of which 41 cases were Guillain-Barre syndrome. The outbreak is declining in the majority of the islands.

In New Caledonia, an additional 73 autochthonous cases of Zika virus (ZIKAV) infection were reported during the last week. As of 26 Feb 2014, 140 confirmed cases have been reported, of which 32 are imported cases.

Norway's Folkehelseinstituttet [Institute of Public Health] reported one case in a resident who traveled to Tahiti earlier this week [week of 24 Feb 2014].

On Thursday [27 Feb 2014], the [USA] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an updated travel notice for New Caledonia.

Zika fever is an illness caused by a virus that spread through mosquito bites. It is closely related to dengue virus and causes a similar illness. Symptoms of Zika fever may include fever, headache, red eyes, rash, muscle aches, and joint pains. The illness is usually mild and lasts 4-7 days.

Travelers who go to certain places in Africa, Asia, and the Western Pacific are at risk of getting Zika virus. The mosquito that carries Zika virus can bite during the day and night, both indoors and outdoors, and often lives around buildings in urban areas.

There is currently no vaccine or medicine to prevent Zika fever. Travelers can protect themselves by preventing mosquito bites.

[Cases of Zika virus infection continue in both French Polynesia and in New Caledonia. The cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome are of concern. In the ProMED-mail post of 8 Jan 2014 (archive no 20140108.2159822), Mod.ML stated, "Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a post-infectious ascending demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy that is thought to be triggered by an immune response against peripheral nerve antigens by a preceding infection. More than 20 cases of GBS have been reported to follow dengue virus infection (http://www.institutpasteur.nc/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/S2-03-O-Simon.pdf), and cases have also been reported to follow chikungunya virus infection (http://www.neurology.org/content/69/22/2105.short#)."

The USA CDC has issued a travel notice Watch - Level 1, Practice Usual Precautions. The precaution is to adopt a variety of measures to avoid mosquito bites (http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/watch/zika-fever-new-caledonia)

Week 9 (23 Feb-Mar 2014)
------------------------
[Up to the last update on 6 Feb 2014,] 2 French overseas territories are affected by outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKAV) infection: French Polynesia and New Caledonia. This is the 2nd documented outbreak of ZIKAV infection reported in the Pacific. It is estimated that more than 29 000 cases have sought medical care with Zika-like symptoms in French Polynesia since the beginning of the outbreak in October 2013. There is a simultaneous dengue outbreak in the region. The French Polynesian health authorities report a concurrent significant increase in neurological syndromes and autoimmune illnesses. The cause and possible links with Zika or dengue virus infections are being investigated.

In French Polynesia, 61 new suspected cases were recorded during the last week [ending 1 Mar 2014] bringing the number of suspected cases to 8503. One additional case of Guillain-Barre syndrome has been reported since the last update. There have been 74 cases of neurological and autoimmune complications of which 41 cases were Guillain-Barre syndrome. The outbreak is declining in the majority of the islands.

In New Caledonia, an additional 73 autochthonous cases of Zika virus (ZIKAV) infection were reported during the last week. As of 26 Feb 2014, 140 confirmed cases have been reported, of which 32 are imported cases.

On 25 February 2014, the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) reported one confirmed case of Zika virus (ZIKAV) infection in a returning traveler from Tahiti.

[It will not be surprising if cases of Zika virus infection occur on other Pacific islands through the movement of viremic travelers. Health authorities on these islands need to exercise good surveillance, and be prepared to differentially diagnose dengue and Zika virus infections. - Mod.TY]
