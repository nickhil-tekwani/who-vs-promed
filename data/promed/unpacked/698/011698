Sheep fetuses affected by the Schmallenberg virus, which had recently spread in Europe, have been recorded in Vorumaa and Hiiumaa; this has been confirmed by the Veterinary and Food Board.

"Laboratory studies of aborted fetuses from sheep farms in Hiiumaa and Vorumaa have confirmed infection by the Schmallenberg virus [SBV]," said Maarja Kristian, Head, Food and Veterinary Office, Division of Animal Health and Animal Feed.

Kristian says this is a viral disease that does not present a very high risk and is not particularly dangerous.

"Quarantine or restrictions or limitations are imposed," said Kristian. "This is a new virus disease in Europe; there is no treatment, and vaccine is not available yet."

Kristian said that such SBV cases have not been identified previously [in Estonia]. These cases were found due to the farmer's information about an increase in the number of abortions in the herd.

"It is primarily a disease of sheep and goats, which can occur in cattle," explained Kristian. Abortions occur in pregnant females, and fetuses are aborted with deformities."

Many sheep breeders have been affected by the aggressive Schmallenberg virus, with deformed and stillborn lambs.

The virus is spread by midges, and pregnant ewes that were infected by the virus in late summer last year [2012] currently give birth to deformed and stillborn lambs.

The virus in present in Sodermanland and Gotland, and a suspected case has been reported from Ostergotland.

[A video showing affected lambs is available at the source URL.]

[SBV is known to have already caused clinical cases (abortions/still-births/congenital malformations) in large and/or small ruminants in the following 16 European countries: Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, Denmark, Switzerland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Finland, Sweden, Estonia and the Czech Republic (Information on cases in the Czech Republic is available at http://tinyurl.com/b8utwgl, dated 21 Dec 2012, thanks to Sabine Zentis for the missed source.). In addition, Norway, Austria, and Poland have detected antibodies in domestic ruminants. In Norway, the virus has been initially detected in biting midges; the official information on positive SBV serology (in cattle) is available at http://tinyurl.com/bh8astc.

The speed and spatial dissemination of SBV in Europe exceed that demonstrated by BTV-8 (2006-2010). The detailed economic and international-trade implications of SBV are yet to be thoroughly assessed.

Last year [2012], the EU allocated 3 million euros [USD 4 million] for scientific studies on SBV in 7 member-countries. The studies were to be co-financed by the commission at 50 percent of eligible costs from 1 Apr 2012 - 31 Dec 2013, details at http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/diseases/schmallenberg_virus/index_en.htm.

SBV is one of the issues on the agenda of the upcoming International Meeting on Emerging Diseases and Surveillance (IMED) in Vienna, 15-18 Feb 2013. - Mod.AS]
