The Nigeria Center for Disease Control, NCDC, has announced that 526 persons have died from cholera even as 22 130 suspected cases of the disease were recorded in 18 states and the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, since the beginning of the cholera outbreak in 2021. The agency also revealed that 28% of the affected population is within the age bracket of 5 to 14 years old while males accounted for 51% of suspected cases and females constituted 49%.

According to the agency's weekly epidemiological report for week 28 [w/e 17 Jul 2021], the affected states are Benue, Delta, Zamfara, Gombe, Bayelsa, Kogi, Sokoto, Bauchi, Kano, Kaduna, Plateau, Kebbi, Cross River, Niger, Nasarawa, Jigawa, Yobe, Kwara as well as the FCT. The report also revealed that there has been a decrease in the number of new cases in the last 2 weeks, notably: Bauchi (2438), Kano (674), and Plateau (87) account for 91% of 3519 cases reported in the last two weeks 27th and 28th.

Since the beginning of 2021, a total of 539 samples have been collected with positive cases as follows - 182 RDT positive only; 55 culture-positive; 237 RDT and culture positive. The test positivity rate (TPR) for laboratory confirmation by culture is 32.2%. In the reporting week, 6 states and FCT reported 1634 suspected cases - Bauchi (1074), Kano, (443), Plateau (45), Zamfara (38), Kaduna (8), Sokoto (24) and FCT (2). Of this, there are 5 RDT confirmed cases from Plateau (3) and Kaduna (2) States. A total of 1634 suspected cases were reported in week 28 representing a 13.3 per cent decrease compared to 1885 suspected cases recorded in week 27 [w/e 10 Jul 2021].

[Cholera continues to increase across many of the states of Nigeria.

As stated by Lutwick et al. (Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Edited by Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J. New York: Nova Bioscience; 2017, pp 113-127), oral rehydration therapy can be lifesaving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it first recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlight the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30% to 3.6% (4) and quote sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 mL/kg followed by 100 mL/kg in the first 4 hours and 100 mL/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the first 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
