Veterinarians are noticing a spike in the number of horses in Northeastern Santa Cruz County that have contracted "pigeon fever" this year [2013]. "I've been seeing tons of it," said JA Phelps of the Sonoita Veterinary Center about the disease that causes abscesses in horses, but that is not spread by the birds for which it is named.

Pigeon fever got its name because it typically sets up in the lymph nodes of the chest, giving afflicted horses an oversized chest like a bird.

Also known as "dry land distemper," the disease had been considered regional until a similar outbreak approximately 10 years ago led to cases being discovered across the United States and now, most recently, in Canada. "It's everywhere," said Phelps, adding that he was told by one biologist that the bacteria [that cause the disease] bloom under certain weather conditions. "There's lots of theories, but no one truly knows how it is transmitted."

What is known is that the disease shows up late summer to fall and horses contract it from eating off the ground. The disease can then incubate for up to 6 months before it becomes evident. In its external form it can be painful and can cause a fever but will often run its course without the need of veterinary care.

However, if the abscess forms inside the horse -- liver, lungs -- it can be difficult to diagnose and can even be deadly.

Phelps has had one fatal case, but attributes it in part to the horse's age and other health issues.

He warned that antibiotics could make the disease worse by forcing it further into the body, where it can be fatal.

"If you let the body control it and resist the temptation to use antibiotics the body will encapsulate it and eventually push it to the surface," said Phelps, adding that "hot packs seem to bring it to the surface faster, as well as exercise.

"The worst thing you can do is to keep a horse in a stall," said Phelps, who recommends letting the abscess open on its own before cleaning it.

After that there are varying opinions as to whether the disease can be spread to other horses or not.

Phelps said he has cleaned plenty of opened lesions at his Sonoita clinic, yet his horses that he keeps nearby have never contracted the disease.

"No one knows how it is transmitted," Phelps said. "I wish we did."

However, veterinarian Dusti Prentice, who has also seen an increase in cases from Sonoita as well as the Palominas and Hereford area near where her practice is located, said the disease is indeed contagious to other horses. Prentice said when the abscesses are broken open and draining flies will get on there and transfer that disease to another horse.

"If you can confine that horse when it has a draining lesion that's the thing to do," Prentice said. "Anything that's oozing out can contaminate the ground and other horses."

Prentice said she has seen the disease affect not just backyard horses but also competition horses.

"It's a very painful disease, but most horses get over it in 2 weeks to 6 months," she said.

[The state of Arizona can be located on the HealthMap/ProMED-mail interactive map at http://healthmap.org/r/9Fvj. Santa Cruz County in southern Arizona, can be seen on the map at http://geology.com/county-map/arizona.shtml.

Pigeon fever, pigeon breast, breastbone fever, dryland distemper, dryland strangles, false strangles, or false distemper are names by which this disease -- caused by the bacterium _Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis_ -- is most frequently known. Geographically, it was at one time considered to be a disease of California, where it is regarded as endemic. However, it is much more widespread now, especially in the western states of the USA, but it has a worldwide distribution. It is a seasonal disease, usually appearing in late fall, but it can appear sporadically at any time of year.
