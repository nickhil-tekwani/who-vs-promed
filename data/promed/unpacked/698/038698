[While this report is labeled as a follow-up report, it does include a new
geographic expansion into Tibet, and it also appears to involve chickens,
as breeding hens are mentioned in the report. The previous OIE reports in
this series were from the Xinjiang autonomous region near Tibet and
involved both geese and ducks. - Mod.PC]
