Girl, 4, isolated amid fears of deadly coronavirus
--------------------------------------------------
A 4-year-old girl visiting from Qatar has been isolated after she tested negative for a deadly SARS-like virus yesterday. The girl had initially sparked fears that the novel coronavirus had reached Hong Kong after she showed signs of carrying the virus that has killed at least 9 people around the world.

She was instead found to be carrying the less dangerous adenovirus -- an unrelated virus associated with respiratory disease. [The novel coronavirus is an RNA virus classified in the family _Coronaviridae_, whereas adenoviruses are DNA viruses classified in the family Adenoviridae_. - Mod.CP] Nonetheless, health officials warned Hongkongers to stay vigilant against the new coronavirus.

Last night, rapid tests were carried out on the girl from the Philippines who had previously travelled to Qatar with her parents. (The 16 reported cases of novel coronavirus infection have occurred are mainly in the Middle East). The child 1st displayed symptoms on Friday [22 Mar 2013] and was sent to a private clinic. She was then transferred to Queen Mary Hospital in Pok Fu Lam with a fever and a headache. She is now in a stable condition, the Secretary for Food and Health Dr Ko Wing-man stated.

Most adenovirus infections are mild and require no therapy or treatment of the flu-like symptoms. Deaths are exceedingly rare. Dr Ko Wing-man said the World Health Organisation had just informed the city of a 16th case of novel coronavirus, which causes severe respiratory disease [See: ProMED-mail post archived as: Novel coronavirus - Eastern Mediterranean (12): KSA, UK fatality, RFI 20130323.1600113}. The patient, based in the Middle East, was a contact of the 15th case, which the WHO reported on 12 Mar 2013. "I have to renew our appeal to all Hong Kong people to remain vigilant and adopt good personal hygiene practices and a healthy lifestyle," Ko said as a sidelines of a 2013 World Tuberculosis Day awareness event.

Reports of the 1st cases of the novel coronavirus in Europe caused panic in Hong Kong, as memories were revived of the severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] outbreak in 2003. The SARS coronavirus, which plunged the city into turmoil and eventually killed 299 people in Hong Kong, arrived via an infected tourist. The epidemic prompted officials to overhaul hospital and immigration procedures aimed at guarding against viral transmissions. According to the WHO, the novel coronavirus has killed 9 out of the 16 people who were infected, meaning its death rate could be higher than 50 per cent.

[Fortunately panic in Hong Kong, the focus of the original coronavirus-mediated SARS outbreak in 2003, has been averted by prompt laboratory identification of the agent, responsible for the respiratory illness of the Filopino child recently arrived from Qatar. However it will be prudent to maintain surveillance of the patient to ensure that her illness is not a consequence of coinfection of the novel coronavirus and a benign helper adenovirus. - Mod.CP
