Many farmers in Punjab, Haryana, as well as parts of Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand have been reporting stunting and yellowing of rice plants. The symptoms occur 30-35 days after transplanting or seeding, with between 10 and 40 percent of plants affected.

Preliminary analysis of samples at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute using electron microscopy and PCR (polymerase chain reaction) so far points towards rice grassy stunt virus, but phytoplasmas, root fungi, or nematodes are also still a possibility. A clearer diagnosis is expected after high-throughput sequencing which is currently being carried out.

[A range of pathogens including fungi, bacteria, viruses, and nematodes have been reported to affect rice crops in the region. Much of the diagnosis above so far appears to be speculation since the possible causes listed are completely unrelated organisms. It is unclear, the sequences specific to which group of these pathogens were targeted by the above mentioned PCR analysis and why the possibilities could not at least be narrowed down to one of the groups.

_Rice grassy stunt virus_ (RGSV; genus _Tenuivirus_) has been reported to cause serious damage in limited areas during sporadic outbreaks of its vector, the brown plant hopper (BPH; _Nilaparvata lugens_). Symptoms may include severe stunting, excessive tillering ('grassy' appearance), and yellowing of leaves. Infected plants usually survive until maturity, but produce no panicles. Disease management may include cultural practices, vector control, and use of rice cultivars with reduced sensitivity or resistance to the virus, the vector, or both. (For further information on RGSV see previous posts in the ProMED archives.)
