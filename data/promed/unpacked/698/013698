Outbreak of _Salmonella_ illnesses linked to Filicetti brand Italian Style mild, dry, cured sausage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is collaborating with provincial public health partners, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) and Health Canada to investigate an outbreak of _Salmonella_ infections occurring in Ontario and Quebec. The outbreak appears to be ongoing, as recent illnesses continue to be reported to PHAC.

Based on the investigation findings to date, exposure to Filicetti brand Italian Style mild, dry, cured sausage has been identified as a source of the outbreak. Some of the individuals who became sick reported eating Filicetti brand Italian Style mild, dry, cured sausage before their illnesses occurred. Other ill individuals reported regularly consuming Filicetti brand dry sausages before getting sick. The investigation is ongoing, and it is possible that other sources could be identified.

On 16 Oct 2019, the CFIA issued a food recall warning for various ready-to-eat dry sausage products that tested positive for _Salmonella_, including Filicetti brand Italian Style mild, dry, cured sausage. Following the recall, additional laboratory testing of a food sample of Filicetti brand Italian Style mild, dry, cured sausage was completed. Laboratory analysis has determined that both the recalled Filicetti brand sausage product and the ill individuals in Ontario and Quebec have the same genetic strain of _Salmonella_.

The CFIA has since identified additional affected products and has issued an updated food recall warning. For additional details on all recalled product names and lot codes, please consult CFIA's website.

Canadians are advised not to eat any of the recalled products or any foods containing the recalled products. Food service establishments are advised not to sell or serve any recalled products, or any items that may have been prepared or produced using recalled products. The CFIA is continuing its food safety investigation, which may lead to the recall of other products. If additional products are recalled, the CFIA will notify the public through updated food recall warnings. This public health notice will be updated as the investigation evolves.

Investigation summary
---------------------
As of 23 Oct 2019, there are 12 confirmed cases of _Salmonella_ Litchfield illness in the following provinces: Ontario (10) and Quebec (2). Individuals became sick between May and September 2019. One individual was hospitalized. No deaths have been reported. Individuals who became ill are between 4 and 81 years of age. The majority of cases (58%) are female.

The collaborative outbreak investigation was initiated because of an increase of _Salmonella_ Litchfield illnesses being reported. This is a rare strain of _Salmonella_ not commonly seen in Canada.

It is possible that more recent illnesses may be reported in the outbreak because there is a period of time between when a person becomes ill and when the illness is reported to public health officials. For this outbreak, the illness reporting period is between 4 and 5 weeks.
