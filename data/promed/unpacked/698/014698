HIGH MORTALITY IN PEARL OYSTERS (PINCTADA MARTENSII) IN JAPAN
Text of an e-mail received on 21 Dec 1998 from Dr Tadao Yagasaki, Director
of Animal Health Division, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries,
Tokyo:
Since the summer of 1996, high mortality in pearl oysters has occurred in
oyster farms nationwide. Common clinical signs in the moribund pearl
oysters are extreme exhaustion and hyposthenia, as well as the colouring of
the adductor muscle and damaged mantle tissues.
1) Recent status of mortality:
------------------------------
Age of pearl Average mortality Normal mortality
oysters since 1996
1 year 40-60% 30-40%
2 years 30-60% 20-30%
2) Present status:
------------------
according to an interview survey on the mortality rate in pearl oysters in
1998 conducted by the prefectural governments and farmers' associations, a
large number of cases of raised mortality are still continuing to occur,
especially in major cultivation areas.
Present state of research on the subject
----------------------------------------
1) At the National Research Institute of Aquaculture, trials of
experimental infection were conducted by implanting pieces of mantle from
both diseased pearl oysters (the test group) and normal ones (the control
group) into normal pearl oysters, and also by cultivating normal pearl
oysters and diseased ones in the same tank. The results were as follows:
- in the implantation test, three months after the implantation of the
mantle, 2 out of 12 pearl oysters died in the test group and all of the
remaining 10 had become red in colour (12 of those in the control group did
not show any change);
- in the cohabitation test, three months after the start of the experiment,
4 out of 13 pearl oysters in the test group had died and the remaining 9
had become red in colour (18 of those in the control group did not show any
changes).
Consequently, it was confirmed that the high mortality in pearl oysters has
been caused by infection.
2) None of the known parasites, fungi, and bacteria is currently thought to
have been responsible for this mortality.
Despite 122 attempts at virus isolation, using 14 types of cell lines, no
virus has been isolated. To date, we have no evidence that the raised
mortality is due to a virus.
Furthermore, high mortality in common oysters also occurred in the western
part of Japan in 1998. This is believed to have been caused by a harmful
bloom, _Heterocapsa circularisquama_, rather than a disease agent.
