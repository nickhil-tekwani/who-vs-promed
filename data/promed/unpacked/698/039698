Pregnant COVID-19 patients are about 40% more likely to develop serious complications or die than their uninfected peers, suggests a study led by University of Utah Health researchers published yesterday [7 Feb 2022] in JAMA (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788985). The retrospective cohort study examined the outcomes of 41 104 women who delivered at 17 hospitals in the United States from 1 Mar 2020 through 31 Dec 2020, following them up to 11 Feb 2021. Among the patients, 2352 had COVID-19 and 11 752 did not.

Most women (80.1%) tested positive for COVID-19 in the 3rd trimester, while 17.6% were in the 2nd trimester, and 2.3% were in the [1st] trimester. Among the 103 patients (4.4%) who first tested positive after delivery, the median timing was 18 days after delivery.

Among patients testing positive, 58 (2.5%) did so more than 2 weeks after delivery. COVID-19 was categorized as critical in 59 patients (2.5%), severe in 180 (7.7%), moderate in 347 (14.8%), mild in 728 (31.0%), and asymptomatic in 1038 (44.1%).

Relative to uninfected patients, those diagnosed as having COVID-19 were significantly more likely to die or become seriously ill because of high blood pressure-related pregnancy disorders, postpartum hemorrhage, or other respiratory infection (13.4% vs 9.2%; adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.41). All 5 maternal deaths occurred in COVID-positive women.

"We already knew that pregnant people are at higher risk for the complications of COVID-19 itself," lead study author Torri Metz said in a news release (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/942595). "Our research is among the first to find that infection with SARS-CoV-2 can elevate the risk of serious consequences related to progression of common pregnancy complications."

Moderate to severe COVID-19, compared with asymptomatic or mild illness, was significantly tied to serious maternal illness, cesarean birth (45.4% vs 32.4%), intensive care unit (ICU) admission (12.8% vs 1.2%), and death (26.1% vs 9.2%). Patients with asymptomatic or mild infection were at significantly higher risk for superficial or deep surgical-site infection (1.8% vs 0.7%; RR 2.55) and high blood pressure-related pregnancy disorders (7.1% vs 6.5%; aRR 1.28).

Other adverse maternal outcomes, including the need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support for treating low blood pressure, cardiomyopathy (disease of the heart muscle), and venous thromboembolism (blood clots), were significantly commoner among COVID-19 patients than their uninfected counterparts. All 4 patients who needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation had COVID-19.

A total of 14 471 newborns were included in the analysis; 2297 were delivered by women who had COVID-19 while pregnant, and 12 017 were born to uninfected women. SARS-CoV-2 exposure was significantly linked to preterm birth (<37 weeks' gestation) (17.7% vs 14.1%; aRR 1.15) and to admission to a neonatal ICU (22.0% vs 17.8%; aRR 1.15).

Most preterm births among COVID-19 patients were medically indicated or didn't result from spontaneous preterm labor (58.8%). COVID-19 was the indication for preterm birth in 8.3% of women who had a medically indicated preterm birth. Among 1323 live births to COVID-19 patients, 1.2% of neonates tested positive for COVID-19 before hospital release.

Overall, COVID-19 infection was not significantly linked with cesarean birth (34.7% vs 32.4%; aRR 1.05), and 1766 patients with asymptomatic or mild infections were not more likely to become seriously ill or die (9.2% vs 9.2%; aRR 1.11) or to give birth via cesarean (31.2% vs 32.4%; aRR 1.00). Patients with moderate or severe COVID-19, however, were prone to cesarean delivery (45.4% vs 32.4%; aRR 1.17).

"Some pregnant individuals who have COVID-19 are just too sick for us to attempt a vaginal birth," Metz said. "In certain circumstances, such as the onset of preeclampsia [high maternal blood pressure leading to seizures], the fetus is also far less likely to tolerate it."

Previous cesarean birth was the reason for cesarean birth in 28.9% of COVID-infection women, compared with 28.6% of their negative peers. Among infected women, 2.3% of the cesarean births were indicated for COVID-19.

"We know from other studies that vaccination prevents the most severe symptoms of the disease," Metz said. "So, this is just another piece of the puzzle that should encourage pregnant people to get vaccinated."

[2] Maternal antibodies

A small Massachusetts General Hospital-based study in JAMA shows more lasting antibodies in infants after COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy than in infants whose mothers had natural COVID-19 infections during pregnancy but were not vaccinated (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2788986).

The study looked at 77 vaccinated pregnant mothers, and 12 who had symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy; all vaccination series with mRNA vaccines were completed between weeks 20 and 32 in pregnancy. The babies of vaccinated women had significantly higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies in both umbilical cord blood at delivery and at blood draws at 2 and 6 months postpartum.

After 2 months, 98% of the infants (48 of 49) born to vaccinated mothers had detectable levels of protective IgG; by 6 months, 57% of infants born to vaccinated mothers had detectable antibodies, compared with just 8% of babies born to mothers with natural infections.

"Although the antibody titer known to be protective against COVID-19 in infants is unknown, these findings provide further incentive for pregnant individuals to pursue COVID-19 vaccination," the authors concluded.

[3] Booster dose
Date: Mon 7 Feb 2022
Source: The New York Times [abridged, edited]
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/07/briefing/boosters-us-covid-omicron.html


The United States has a vaccination problem. And it is not just about the relatively large share of Americans who have refused to get a shot. The US also trails many other countries in the share of vaccinated people who have received a booster shot. In Canada, Australia and much of Europe, the recent administering of COVID-19 booster shots has been rapid. In the US, it has been much slower. Millions of Americans who have already received 2 vaccine shots -- eagerly, in many cases -- have not yet received a follow-up. The unboosted include many Republicans, Democrats and independents and span racial groups.

The most urgent problem involves the unboosted elderly. (About 14% of Americans over 65 eligible for a booster had not received one as of mid-January 2022, according to Kaiser.) But some younger adults are also getting sick as their vaccine immunity wears off.

A recent study from Israel, published in The New England Journal of Medicine (https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2115926) showed that for both the elderly and people between 40 and 59, severe illness and death were notably lower among the boosted than the merely vaccinated. As Dr Leana Wen wrote in The Washington Post, "The evidence is clear that it is at least a 3-dose vaccine" (https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/01/24/new-studies-show-that-booster-dose-is-essential-our-policies-should-change-accordingly/).

What explains the American booster shortfall? I think there are 2 main answers, both related to problems with the American health system.

First, medical care in the US is notoriously fragmented. There is neither a centralized record system, as in Taiwan, nor a universal insurance system, as in Canada and Scandinavia, to remind people to get another shot. Many Americans also do not have a regular contact point for their health care. As a result, preventive care -- like a booster shot -- often falls through the cracks.

The 2nd problem is one that has also bedeviled other aspects of US COVID response: government health officials, as well as some experts, struggle to communicate effectively with the hundreds of millions of us who are not experts. They emphasize small amounts of uncertainty that are important to scientific research but can be counterproductive during a global emergency. They are cautious to the point of hampering public health.

As an analogy, imagine if a group of engineers surrounded firefighters outside a burning building and started asking if they were using the most powerful hoses on the market. The questions might be reasonable in another setting, but pointless if not damaging during a blaze. A version of this happened early in the pandemic, when experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, discouraged widespread mask wearing. They based that stance partly on the absence of research specifically showing that masks reduced the spread of COVID. But obviously there had not been much research on a brand-new virus. Multiple sources of scientific information did suggest that masks would probably reduce COVID's spread, much as they reduced the spread of other viruses. Health officials cast aside this evidence.

Similar problems have occurred since then, especially in the US:
- regulators were slow to give formal approval to the COVID vaccines while they waited for more data -- even as those same regulators were pleading with people to get shots;
- regulators were slow to approve rapid tests -- even as Britain and Germany were using them effectively;
- US officials were slow to tell people who had received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to get a follow-up shot -- even as some experts were persuaded enough by the data to do so themselves.

As a result, Americans were slower to put on masks and slower to be vaccinated than they could have been. In the US, some officials and experts continue to ask whether the evidence is strong enough to encourage boosters for younger adults. Two top FDA officials quit partly over the Biden administration's recommendation of universal boosters. The skeptics say they want to wait for more evidence.

A global total of 13 190 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours (late 6 Feb 2022 to late 7 Feb 2022). The exponential rise in cases over the last few weeks can be attributed to the rapid spread of the omicron variant globally. The 7-day averages indicate a decreasing global trend for cases and an increasing trend for deaths.

A total of 87 countries reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours; 48 of the 87 countries are from the European region, 12 are from the Americas region, 12 are from the Eastern Mediterranean region, 6 are from the Western Pacific region, 5 from the South East Asia region, and 4 are from the African region.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, case counts have decreased by 19.3%, while daily reported deaths have increased by 7.1%. Similar comparative 7-day averages in the USA show a 33.4% decrease in daily reported cases and a 2.7% decrease in reported deaths.

Impression: The global daily report counted over 2.44 million newly confirmed infections in the past 24 hours with over 400.53 million cumulative reported cases and over 5.78 million reported deaths. Despite some decreases in the number of cases, transmission continues at a very high level. - Mod.UBA]
