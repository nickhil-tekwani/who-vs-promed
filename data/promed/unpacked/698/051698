Norwalk-Like Virus Outbreaks at 2 Summer Camps in Wisconsin, June 2001
----------------------------------------------------------------------
On 27 and 28 Jun 2001, the Wisconsin Division of Public Health was notified
by 2 local health departments of outbreaks of gastroenteritis [Defined as
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in a camper or staff member while at camp A
or B during the period 10 Jun to 30 Jun 2001. at 2 summer recreational
camps (camps A and B) in northern Wisconsin. This report summarizes the
investigation of these outbreaks, which documents person-to-person
transmission of "Norwalk-like virus" (NLV) and underscores the importance
of cleaning environmental surfaces and the availability and use of
hand-washing facilities at recreational camps.
Camp A opened for the 2001 season with a week of staff training on 10 Jun
2001. During this week, several counselors became ill with fatigue, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea with illness duration of 24--48 hours. Campers first
arrived for a 6-day camp session on 17 Jun 2001 and, within 30 hours of
arrival, began having signs and symptoms identical to those experienced by
the counselors. A second group of campers replaced the previous campers on
24 Jun 2001. Because many persons became ill in the second group, the camp
session was canceled, the campers were sent home, and the local public
health department was notified on 27 Jun 2001. During the 3-week period,
approximately 80 (20%) of 400 campers and camp staff were ill.
The first case of illness was noted at camp B on 24 Jun 2001 when a child
arrived at camp with diarrhea. On 25 Jun 2001, another camper became ill
with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. During the next 5 days, at least 40
(17%) of the 240 campers and camp staff became ill with identical signs and
symptoms lasting 24--48 hours. The campers remained at camp B for the full
one-week session.
Inspection of the camps revealed no substantial problems with food storage
or preparation; no leftover foods were available for testing. The campers
served themselves family style in a single dining hall at each camp. Ill
campers were housed in cabins (camp A) or tents (camp B) with campers who
were not ill. Most toilet facilities were pit toilets with hand-washing
facilities consisting of cool running water. The camps provided no soap or
towels at the pit toilets. Non-municipal wells were the source of drinking
water at the camps. An environmental survey found no deficiencies with
these wells.
Stool specimens were obtained from ill campers and staff at camps A and B.
Bacterial enteric pathogen testing was negative and reverse transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction for NLV was positive for 3 of the 8 specimens
from camp A and 2 of the 4 specimens from camp B. Samples of the well water
obtained 3 weeks after the outbreaks were negative for fecal coliforms.
The camps, which serve boys aged 10--18 years and are affiliated with the
same national youth organization, are located 80 miles apart. They shared
no food or personnel and no epidemiologic links were apparent between the
camps. Gene sequencing to determine relatedness of the viruses is pending.
Although the initial sources of NLV were not discovered, the nature of both
outbreaks, particularly the onsets of illness during a several-day period
and the continuation of the outbreak among separate groups of campers at
camp A, indicated the infections were spread within each camp by
person-to-person transmission.
NLV can be spread from person-to-person by direct contact, fomites, and
aerosols. The close contact of ill and well campers and the rustic setting
of the camps probably contributed to person-to-person transmission by
contaminated surfaces in the toilet, dining hall, and living facilities.
During the period 30 Jun to 1 Jul 2001, the washable surfaces at the camps
were cleaned with a 10% bleach solution and soap dispensers were added to
the hand-washing facilities at camp A. No further cases of gastrointestinal
illness were reported at the camps after 30 Jun 2001.
