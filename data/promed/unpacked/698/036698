The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reported that 16 people have now been sickened from a hepatitis A outbreak linked to blackberries. The FDA and CDC are investigating illnesses in Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, and Wisconsin. These are potentially linked to fresh conventional blackberries from the grocery store Fresh Thyme Farmers Market. The company says that there is no evidence any of the product was contaminated via handling in its stores.

Of the 16 people who have fallen ill, 9 have been hospitalized. The most recent illness onset date [was] on [15 Nov 2019].

The FDA said that although the ill patients reported consuming fresh conventional blackberries in 6 states, traceback information to date [3 Dec 2019] shows that these berries came from a distribution center that ships fresh berries to Fresh Thyme Farmers Market stores in 11 states. These are Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

"As this investigation continues, the FDA will work with our federal and state partners to obtain additional information during the traceback investigation and will update this advisory as more information becomes available," the FDA said. The FDA is urging consumers to not eat any fresh conventional blackberries if purchased [from 9-30 Sep 2019] from Fresh Thyme Farmers Market stores in the 11 states mentioned above. People who purchased the fresh blackberries and then froze those berries for later consumption should not eat these berries.

[Three more states are involved in this outbreak. Most of the hepatitis A outbreaks associated with berries have been related to frozen ones. The source of the berries is not stated. It would be interesting to know if the berries originated in one of the states in the USA with ongoing outbreaks of hepatitis A virus and whether the strain analysis matches the outbreak strain in those states. - Mod.LL
