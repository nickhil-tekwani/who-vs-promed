The number of people who died from swine flu [influenza A(H1N1)] has reached 23, Myanmar health authorities confirmed [Fri 11 Aug 2017].

A total of 535 people have been hospitalized with severe acute respiratory infection in 10 out of 15 regions of the country since [21 Jul 2017], according to the Health Department under the Ministry of Health and Sports.

The department said in a press release that the outbreak had claimed 23 patients so far, while 204 others were confirmed to have been infected with the H1N1 virus.

Than Tun Aung, deputy director general of the Health Department, told Anadolu Agency that the outbreak was just seasonal, and not an unusual event.

"It's rainy season which is flu season for our country," he said, however, admitting that the infection rate had been on the rise as the virus spread by air.

The World Health Organization is providing technical support to the Myanmar government, consulting with regional experts, and offering assistance to have samples tested abroad, he added.

In addition to the swine flu [influenza A(H1N1)] outbreak, Myanmar also confirmed last month [July 2017] an H5N1 [influenza] virus outbreak, commonly known as bird flu, in Yangon and in the southernmost region of Tanintharyi [see archive no 20170727.5205602].

[The report does not give any details on whether the hospitalized cases had any underlying conditions linked to increased morbidity and mortality with influenza infections, particularly A/H1N1.

The total number of positive cases 204/535 (38 percent), appears to be high; however, it is distributed over 10 regions and the incidence rates can be inferred when total population data stratified by various age groups is available. - Mod.UBA
