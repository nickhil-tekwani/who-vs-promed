[According to Morocco's official information to the OIE, PPR was recorded there for the 1st and, until now, the most recent time, between June 2008 - Jan 2009. Hundreds of outbreaks were reported. Mass vaccination (with a live-attenuated PPR vaccine) was subsequently applied.

The following data present the number of vaccine doses reported as produced and as applied since 2009, according to Morocco's annual reports to the OIE:
Year/doses produced/doses applied
2009/ 21 021 000 / not specified
2010/ 26 373 200 / 22 978 158
2011/ 5 524 400 / 716 699
2012/ 5 211 100 / applied, no quant data available
2013/ 5 211 100 / applied, no quant data available
2014/ 5 071 600 / applied, no quant data available

According to the reports vaccination has been named as an official control measure each year since 2009 but figures for the recent 3 years are not available.

PPR, as one of the most damaging of all animal diseases, is among the priority diseases indicated in the FAO-OIE Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs) 5 Year Action Plan. In response to recommendations of GF-TADs, a resolution by the World Assembly of Delegates of the OIE (May 2014) and recommendations of the Committee on Agriculture (COAG) and the Council of FAO, the GF-TADs Working group has developed the PPR Global Control and Eradication Strategy, which has been presented at the FAO and OIE International Conference for the Control and Eradication of peste des petits ruminants held in Abidjan (Cote d'Ivoire), from 31 Mar to 2 Apr 2015. For the 83-page document presenting the "PPR Global Control Eradication Strategy", please refer to http://www.fao.org/3/a-i4460e.pdf.

Further information has been posted in today's (4 Jul 2015) report on the event in ProMED-MENA (Middle East/North Africa). The following detailed commentary by ProMED-MENA's moderator AB is hereby presented for subscribers' covenience . - Mod.AS

Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) appeared in Morocco for the 1st time on 12 Jun 2008, in the center of the country. The disease then spread rapidly in several parts of the country and, in August 2008, outbreaks were reported near the border with Algeria. The origin of the outbreak remains unknown.

PPR was known to be endemic in Africa south of the Sahara and in Egypt, but the source of its unexpected introduction, almost concurrently in 3 Maghreb countries (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia) and the order in which these countries were contaminated have not been accurately determined.

It seems that the infection has since become endemic in the Maghreb, but, given the possible confusion of its mild forms with other infectious diseases of small ruminants, it is rarely suspected. Goats usually develop a more pronounced clinical form of the disease than sheep. Reported morbidity and mortality rates in Morocco were variable but never reached the alarming figures reported in sub-Saharan Africa.

Vaccination is usually performed in response to new outbreaks and is limited to the flocks of the affected areas.

More information on PPR as it appeared in Morocco in 2008 is available at http://www.fao.org/3/a-aj120f.pdf [French]; http://www.fao.org/3/a-aj120e.pdf [English]. - Mod.AB
