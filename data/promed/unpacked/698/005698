[C] Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) multi-country outbreak - Update 10
<http://www.who.int/csr/don/2003_03_26/en/>

Data from China, countries introduce stringent control measures

China updates data on cases and deaths
Chinese authorities have today officially reported a total of 792 cases and
31 deaths in an outbreak of atypical pneumonia that began in southern
China, in Guangdong Province on 16 Nov 2002. Cases were reported to have
occurred in 7 cities of Guangdong Province.

Chinese authorities had previously reported to WHO, on 14 Feb 2003, a total
of 305 cases and 5 deaths from 16 Nov 2002 to 9 Feb 2003. The new figures
cover the period of 16 Nov 2002 to 28 Feb 2003.

A WHO team of 5 international experts, which arrived in China on the
weekend, has today reviewed the case definition used in reporting cases of
atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province. The WHO team compared this
definition with the WHO definition used to identify probable cases of
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and concluded that the 2
definitions are compatible.

Following in-depth discussion with central-level authorities and health
officials in Guangdong Province on the details of several clusters of
cases, the WHO expert team reached the conclusion that the atypical
pneumonia cases which began occurring in southern China in November 2002
are likely cases of the same disease, now referred to as SARS, that began
appearing in other Asian countries on 26 Feb 2003 and has since spread
widely to several cities throughout the world.

Chinese authorities further informed the WHO team of a new reporting system
that will rely on regular provincial updates. WHO is expecting further
information on reported cases in China for March 2003 as these data become
available.

Case management guidelines being used in China are in line with WHO
recommendations for minimizing further transmission.

China is also beginning a collaborative programme in which sera from
infected Chinese patients will be exchanged with the WHO network of
collaborating laboratories who are working to identify the SARS causative
agent.

Update on reported cases
The new data from China bring the total number of reported probable cases
worldwide, dating back to 16 Nov 2003, to 1323 cases and 49 deaths. When
the data from China are excluded, todays figures represent an increase of
41 cases, largely concentrated in Hong Kong SAR China, and one death, in
Singapore, compared with yesterday. [see [A] above]

National measures to contain further spread
Several countries are introducing maximum measures, including quarantine,
to prevent the further spread of SARS.

New diseases such as SARS are poorly understood as they emerge. At the
beginning of an outbreak, it is sound public health policy to institute
maximum control measures needed to prevent further spread.

Maximum measures are justified when, in the view of national health
authorities, they can be expected to protect populations against infection,
keep the disease from spreading into the general population, and help
prevent international spread to other countries, particularly through air
travel.

As the epidemiology of SARS becomes more fully understood, such measures
can be adjusted and reduced in line with what is known about how the
disease is transmitted and what works best to stop its spread, both
nationally and internationally.

The first global "grand rounds" on SARS clinical features and treatment
were held today by WHO. The electronic meeting united 80 clinicians from 13
countries. A summary of their discussions and conclusions has been posted
today at the WHO web site. [see ProMED-mail posting: SARS - Worldwide (09):
clinical features]

Previous hypothesis for Chinese outbreak: atypical pneumonia caused by
Chlamydia:
On 18 Feb 2003, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, in
collaboration with the Guangdong Center for Disease Control and Prevention,
announced the finding of evidence of infection with the Chlamydia bacterium
in 2 specimens taken from the lungs of patients who died from atypical
pneumonia in southern China. [see ProMED-mail posting Pneumonia - China
(Guangdong) (04) 20030219.0427 - Mod.MPP]

On Monday, Chinese authorities asked the WHO team to assist in
investigation of Chlamydia as a causative agent. This request was
transmitted to members of a WHO network of 11 labs set up to expedite
identification of the SARS pathogen.

On Tuesday, during the daily teleconference with the network, laboratory
scientists reported that numerous tests had been run to determine the
presence of Chlamydia bacteria in specimens from confirmed SARS cases
elsewhere in the world. Most tests have come back negative for Chlamydia.
Additional negative test results were reported today.

These findings suggest that Chinese patients were likely co-infected with
Chlamydial organisms together with the true cause of the outbreak, which
remains unidentified.

Progress towards identification of the virus:
Research attention is increasingly focusing on the Coronavirus family,
though viruses from the Paramyxovirus and other families are also being
considered as scientists cast the widest possible net in their search for
the cause of SARS. Many are of the opinion that a diagnostic test could
rapidly follow conclusive identification of the pathogen. Experts in the
network are also considering the theory that SARS is caused by co-infection
with 2 new viruses that somehow need each other in order to cause severe
disease in humans. Evidence is strongly pointing to a new virus, or
possibly 2 new viruses, that have not previously been known to infect
humans or cause severe disease.

Hypotheses include a virus known to cause disease in an animal host that
has jumped the species barrier to infect humans, or a known human virus
that has mutated to acquire properties that are causing much more severe
disease in humans. It is increasingly certain, however, that SARS is a
serious new disease caused by a newly recognized pathogen.

Part 2 - Health condition of students under close surveillance 26 Mar 2003
------
The Department of Health (DH) on 26 Mar 2003 confirmed 2 new cases of
atypical pneumonia involving 2 school children.

The Consultant in-charge of DH's Disease Prevention and Control Division,
Dr Tse Lai-yin, said the girls were among the 316 cases confirmed today to
have contracted atypical pneumonia.

The first case involved a 7-year-old girl who is a student of the PM
session of SKH Kei Tak Primary School in Wong Tai Sin. She developed
symptoms on 23 Mar 2003. She was admitted to Kwong Wah Hospital on 24 Mar
2003 and is now in stable condition.

In the second case, a 16-year-old girl studying at Ying Wa Girls' School in
Central and Western District developed symptoms on 24 Mar 2003. She was
admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital on 25 Mar 2003 and is now in stable
condition.

As a precaution against atypical pneumonia, Ying Wa Girls' School has, in
consultation with DH and the Education and Manpower Bureau, decided to
close for 2 days until 28 Mar 2003. Both the AM and PM sessions of SKH Kei
Tak Primary School have been closed earlier until 31 Mar 2003.

"DH is still looking for the source of infection for the cases. The health
condition of the girls' family members, classmates and teachers are also
under close surveillance," Dr Tse said.

[A] Update (13) on SARS cases in Singapore 26 Mar 2003
<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5660>

As at 26 Mar 2003, a total of 74 people with SARS have been reported to the
Ministry of Health. The 5 additional patients are hospital staff. All these
cases are still traced back to the index cases. 13 patients have been
discharged from hospital, while the remaining 60 patients are hospitalised.
All the patients are stable except for 10 patients who are in serious
condition. One patient who was in intensive care passed away on 25 Mar 2003.

SARS is not infectious until the person develops fever. Transmission of
SARS is only through close contact with infected persons. All the SARS
cases in Singapore so far are close contacts which are linked to the 3
index cases.


[B] Joint Press Release by Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health -
Closure of schools 26 Mar 2003
<http://app.moh.gov.sg/new/new02.asp?id=1&mid=5661>

As an additional precautionary measure in response to concerns expressed by
parents on the recent SARS cases, the Ministry of Education (MOE) and
Ministry of Health (MOH) have decided to close all primary schools,
secondary schools, junior colleges, and centralised institutes from Thu 27
Mar 2003 to Sun 6 April 2003.

All schools have been adhering closely to MOH's advisories since school
re-opened after the March holidays. They have been screening their students
every day since school re-opened. On purely medical grounds, there are
currently no strong reasons for closing all schools. However, principals
and general practitioners have reported that parents continue to be
concerned about the risk to their children in schools. MOE and MOH hope
that this additional precautionary step to close schools will address
parents' concerns and further reassure them.


Update on SARS
--------------
The control measures already instituted are minimising the risk of
transmission of SARS within the community. Home quarantine of contacts
allows us to identify and isolate those who come down with SARS early and
prevent spread to others. In the hospitals, no more healthcare workers have
been infected with SARS by known or suspected cases, since the
implementation of the enhanced infection control precautions.

All the SARS cases in Singapore so far can be traced back to the 3 index
cases. The index cases passed on the infection to 21 primary close
contacts, who in turn infected 26 other secondary close contacts. Further
transmission of the infection appears to be stabilising, with only 23 more
tertiary close contacts being infected. The control measures appear to be
working, although it is still too early to be confident of this.

Details of school closure
---------------
All school competitions and co-curricular activities scheduled between now
[26 Mar 2003] and 6 Apr 2003 will be cancelled or postponed. The current
school term, Term 2, will be extended into the June school holidays, to
make up for losses in curriculum time.

The universities, polytechnics, and Institute of Technical Education will
continue to operate as normal. These institutes of higher learning have a
different system of operation from our national schools. Furthermore, the
students in our post-secondary institutions are older and are better able
to understand the situation and take the necessary precautions.

MOE will advise the pre-school centres to close for the same period.
Similarly, the Ministry of Community Development and Sports will be closing
childcare centres while the People's Association will be closing the
playgroups and tuition classes at community centres/clubs and residents'
committees. Student Care Centres are advised to do likewise. Special
education schools, as advised by the National Council of Social Services,
and madrasahs, as advised by Majlis Ugama Islam Singapura, will also close
during this period.

MOE urges employers to exercise flexibility in allowing their employees
affected by the closure of schools to take urgent leave to make alternative
child care arrangements.

The Ministry of Education and Ministry of Health will review the SARS
situation before the end of next week.

Update 11 - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
--------------------
As of 26 Mar 2003, Health Canada has received reports of 28 individuals who
have become ill with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Ontario
and British Columbia. There have been 3 deaths in Canada. All Canadian
cases have occurred in persons who have traveled to Asia or had contact
with SARS cases in the household or in a health-care setting. The
information contained in this update is based on the best available
information Health Canada has at this time.

The details of the cases to date are as follows:

Ontario: 27 total cases. To date, all cases have occurred in close family
contacts of travelers returning from Hong Kong or in heath care workers who
have cared for these cases.

British Columbia: one person has been hospitalized with SARS after
returning from travel in southeast Asia.

At this time, the cause of SARS remains unknown, however national and
international laboratory testing and collaboration is ongoing. Here are the
most recent developments:

Due to the mounting concern about transmission of the SARS agent in
non-hospital and community settings in the City of Hanoi, Vietnam; Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region and Guangdong Province in China; and
Singapore, Health Canada recommends that persons planning to travel to
these areas should defer all travel until further notice. Health Canada is
aware that health authorities in these affected areas are making concerted
efforts to contain the spread of SARS in their populations. Given the
uncertainties of the current situation, Health Canada believes it is
prudent to await the outcome of national and international control measures
before undertaking travel to these destinations.

For further information on this travel advisory, please see:
<http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/pphb-dgspsp/tmp-pmv/2003/sars0325_e.html>

Health Canada has deployed 5 epidemiologists to assist Toronto Public
Health and the Ontario Ministry of Health with the investigation of SARS
cases currently under investigation.The department has also provided
guidelines for infection control and recommendations on actions for public
health settings.

[A] China - from the Beijing Morning Post 27 Mar 2003
<http://211.162.227.87/news/030327bjds2.htm> (in Chinese, similar
information available in English at
<http://www.goasiapacific.com/news/GoAsiaPacificBNA_817353.htm>

There is a report that 8 patients came to Beijing for treatment, 3 died,
and 2 local health care workers were infected.
Two of these patients have come from the province of Shanxi for
treatment in Beijing.

[Note: This was originally posted in error as Shanxi (Shanghai). Shanxi is
an inland province and Shanghai in a city in the southeastern China. We
regret the error and are grateful to Dan Silver for pointing this out.]

[B] Canada from Canadian Broadcasting Company 26 Mar 2003
<http://www.cbc.ca/stories/2003/03/26/quarantine030326>

The government of Ontario has declared a state of emergency and is
requesting that anyone who was at Scarborough Grace Hospital in the past 10
days is to be isolated at home. That decision was made after several
health care workers at the hospital showed signs of the illness. Toronto's
Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Sheela Basrur says action needs to be taken
to stop the spread immediately. "It's like a brush fire that's throwing off
sparks, if you want to control it you have to put a ring around the fire,
so it does not spread further." To help stop the spread, the provincial
government has stepped in. "Premier Ernie Eves has declared that severe
acute respiratory syndrome is a provincial emergency," said James Young,
Ontario's commissioner of public safety.

[In essence this is a request for a voluntary quarantine on the part of the
public. - Mod.MPP]

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Marianne Hopp <mjhopp12@yahoo.com>,
jm@mb-lab.com, John Herbert <j_a_herbert@yahoo.com>, and Henry L Niman, PhD
<henry_niman@hms.harvard.edu> for their submissions.

With the addition of the SARS cases reported from mainland China, there are
now 1323 cases with 49 deaths reported (representing a reported case
fatality rate of 3.7 percent). As more information becomes available we
expect these numbers to change. There is discussion in this of the earlier
report of the chlamydia identification in 2 of the cases from Guangdong
(see ProMED-mail coverage of the Guangdong outbreak below) and the failure
to identify chlamydia in other cases, leading to the final conclusion that
these chlamydia isolates probably represented secondary infection with
chlamydia, with the primary illness being due to the as-yet-unidentified
etiologic agent of SARS.

Of additional note is the press release from Beijing announcing additional
cases now in Beijing, with 2 coming from Shanxi province.

[Note: This was originally posted in error as Shanxi (Shanghai). Shanxi is
an inland province and Shanghai in a city in the southeastern China. We
regret the error and are grateful to Dan Silver for pointing this out.]

As pointed out by Dr. Steven Berger <mberger@post.tau.ac.il> following the
confirmation of SARS cases in Southern China beginning in 16 Nov
2002, "Existing SARS case definitions which specify disease onset '..after
1 Feb 2003...' presents us with a syllogistic exclusion of cases in
mainland China (November 2002 to 31 Jan 2003). Suggest revision of this
criterion, and an updated summary of case counts." As can be seen in
today's WHO case update, the data have been revised to include these
reported cases. What awaits next is the revision in the case definition,
and a "look-back" investigation to see whether there were additional cases
outside of China preceding 1 Feb 2003 that may have been excluded under the
earlier case definition. - Mod.MPP]
