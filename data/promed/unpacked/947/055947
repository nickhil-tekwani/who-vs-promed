[For a better appreciation of where this outbreak is, go to http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IT/07/Valmontone.html.

It seems to be the summer for Italian anthrax outbreaks not in Basilicata in southern Italy. This ovine outbreak puzzles me a bit. Sheep are not robust grazers like cattle. They nibble preferably weeds, not grass. Therefore their soil intake is minimal, unlike cows who will consume some 5-6 lb (2.3-2.7 kg) of soil per day. Secondly, outbreaks in a new area usually involve a dozen or more sheep before it is noticed; here it was diagnosed based on 2 sheep, apparently, unless this represents just the sheep sampled and tested by the National Laboratory in Foggia. So we must await the release of the investigation results to see how it came about and whether it might have been secondary to a nearby unreported bovine outbreak.

Past outbreaks were reported in Lazio in cattle in 1997 and 2000, and in sheep in 2005. - Mod.MHJ
