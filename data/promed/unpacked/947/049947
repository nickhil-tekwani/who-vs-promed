More than 200 birds have died from a presumed outbreak of avian flu at a Chicago-area forest preserve, according to authorities.

The deaths occurred at the Baker's Lake forest preserve, the Forest Preserves of Cook County said in a statement on Thursday [14 Apr 2022].

The federal government, which provides the only declaration of incidences of avian influenza, is conducting further tests to determine the cause of death.

The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus is very contagious among birds and can be lethal in domestic poultry, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, it poses a low risk to the human population.

Zoos across the country have been moving their birds indoors over the past couple of months to protect them from the spread of the potentially deadly strain.

The Baker's Lake preserve is home to one of the most significant heron rookeries in the Midwest, according to the Forest Preserves organization.

In addition, many other native and migratory birds nest and feed there. "Because of the nature of the local bird population, the avian influenza impact to date has only been observed among waterfowl and water birds," the organization added.

Biologists presented "7 cormorants for necropsy and testing to state pathologists" on April 7 [2022] after finding numerous dead birds a day earlier, the organization said.

Lab results showed the birds were suffering from a presumed outbreak of H5 avian influenza, it said.

Cases of avian flu have been rising in backyard flocks and wild birds across dozens of states in recent months.

The flu was first detected in February [2022] in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana, according to the US Department of Agriculture. This was the 1st case of infection in the US since 2020.

[The Eurasian H5N1 first detected in January (2022) in the Atlantic coast of North America continues to spread. Some wild migratory waterbirds contribute to the propagation of HPAI viruses. However, it is important to acknowledge that only a few bird species may play a role in the propagation of HPAI viruses. Most wild bird species, as well as poultry and other domestic birds, are neither tolerant nor resistant to HPAI viruses, and thus they become ill and do not move much, which implies that are poor spreaders and instead they may act as sentinels of viral circulation. The fact that most bird species are susceptible to HPAI viruses is a concern for the conservation of many species. - Mod.PMB]
