Panama declared an epidemic alert and canceled traditional Lenten carnivals
in a central province after [a hantavirus killed three people. Six more
people were hospitalized with the pneumonia-like effects of the virus in
the central province of Los Santos, 150 miles west of Panama City, said
Health Minister Jose Teran.
"This situation constitutes an extremely grave danger for the population of
this province," Teran said late Thursday.
The Health Ministry said tests conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control confirmed that a total of nine people - five women and four men -
had been infected with the virus. The biggest outbreak of the virus to date
in Latin America occurred in Chile in 1997, killing 16 people.
Authorities said they believed the infection had been spread by rats or by
field mice.
While the virus is not commonly spread by contact between humans,
authorities canceled the planned March 4 carnival in Los Santos, which
draws thousands of visitors to the region each year.

[The previous message posted by ProMED-mail indicated that the vector was
"rats" but now that has been modified to read "rats or mice". In other
words, rodents are the suspected vertebrate vector of whatever hantavirus
is causing these few cases. A more recent report from El Panama America
<http://www.epasa.com/El_Panama_America/archive/02252000/topstory.html>
indicates that two provinces have been declared "epidemic zone subject to
sanitary control", all the territory of the provinces of Los Santos and
Herrera. As a result, Carnival celebrations have been cancelled in both
places.
Thus far, this can be only considered a large cluster of cases but the
Panamanian Government's efforts to prevent more cases and clean up the
environment are to be commended.
I am assuming that someone will tell us the etiologic agent soon after it
is known to them. Meanwhile, we are like the proverbial mushroom. - Mod.CHC
