Switzerland Reports 3 More Cases BSE
--------------------------------------------------------
HAMBURG: The Swiss Federal Veterinary Agency said Wednesday 3 more cases of
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, have been found
in Switzerland. This brings the number of confirmed cases to 8 in 2001. One
case was in the Zug canton (local government area), one in the Bern canton
and one in Schwyz. In 2000, Switzerland had 33 BSE cases.
Switzerland imposed a ban on feeding meat and bone meal (MBM) to cattle in
May 1996.

BRUSSELS: The European Commission said on Monday its scientific advisers
believe certain east European countries including Poland, the Czech
Republic, and Hungary are likely to have mad cow disease in their cattle
herds. The opinion, issued by the scientists on a range of non-European
Union countries, forms part of the Commission's assessment of mad cow, or
bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), risk among countries seeking to
export beef to the EU.
Albania, Cyprus, Estonia, the Slovak Republic, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Lithuania, and Switzerland were classed "category III," meaning
"likely to present a BSE risk, even if not confirmed, or presenting a low
level of confirmed BSE risk." All those countries not in "category I" --
BSE highly unlikely -- have to remove potentially dangerous cattle tissues
such as spinal cords at the slaughterhouse from meat they intend to export
to the EU. The Commission said the countries in category III had imported
significant numbers of live cattle and meat and bonemeal from EU countries
where BSE has been confirmed. "Therefore it is regarded likely that their
cattle herds were exposed to potentially BSE-contaminated feed and
subsequently infected," the Commission said in a statement. Switzerland
remains the only country outside the EU to have confirmed the presence of
native cases of mad cow disease.
The category II country list, where a BSE risk is deemed to be unlikely but
is not excluded, contains the United States, Canada, India, Pakistan, and
Colombia. Category I countries include Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Norway, and New Zealand.

[UK Ministers are considering banning hundreds of medicines after the
makers failed to prove they do not risk infecting patients with the human
form of Mad Cow Disease. The Health Department says 800 drugs breach
European Union rules on medicine safety. Many use animal material such as
cattle serum. Companies were warned as long ago as 1989 not to use serum
from cattle that could have been exposed to the risk of infection by BSE.
Ministers will not reveal which drugs are involved in the new scare but
insist all vaccines and inoculations in Britain, including the
controversial measles, mumps, and rubella jab, have passed tests.
A deadline expired this month for drug firms to prove products are free
from CJD.
No information was given to ministers on almost 1000 pharmaceutical
products. It is understood this remains the case for some 800 medicines.
The Medicines Control Agency has been told to make risk assessments of all
products whose makers failed to submit scientific proof that they were
BSE-free. Asked about the possibility of medicines being banned, a senior
Health Department source said: "We won't hesitate to act to protect public
health if advised to do so."
Despite some drug companies effectively breaking the law, the Health
Department refused to say if they will be prosecuted.
