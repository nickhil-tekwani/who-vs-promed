The number of people poisoned by highly toxic waste that was dumped
at open-air sites in Abidjan by a foreign ship has risen from 1500 to
more than 5000 people, the country's health ministry said on
Saturday, drastically increasing the toll of those affected.
"By yesterday (Friday) we had counted more than 5000 people in health
centres" for problems linked to the toxic poisoning, the ministry's
spokesperson Simeon N'Da told AFP. "The number of deaths remains
unchanged at 3," he added.
Ivory Coast's entire cabinet resigned on Wednesday over the poisoning
scandal and an inter-ministerial committee was set up to handle the crisis.
International waste disposal, health and environmental experts have
arrived to help the skeleton administration, which has announced an
emergency plan to neutralize the toxic fumes from the waste.
The toxic material was dumped onto open-air sites in Abidjan, the
country's commercial capital and largest city, 3 weeks ago by a
Panamanian-registered ship.
The toxic material -- 400 tonnes of oil refining waste, rich in
organic matter and very toxic elements, according to environmental
pressure group Greenpeace -- was dumped at about 10 sites across
Abidjan, a city of 4 million people.
It contains hydrogen sulphide and organochloride, which are both
poisonous and can cause nausea, rashes, fainting, diarrhoea and headaches.
The Greek company that owns the vessel, Prime Marine Management,
confirmed the waste had been discharged but said the action was
lawful. The "Probo Koala" was chartered by a Netherlands-based
company, which says an Ivorian firm had been entrusted with handling
the unloaded waste.

[BBC World News on 10 Sep 2006 said the total number of people
affected has risen to 6000, with 5 deaths. - Mod.JW]
[Hydrogen sulfide is a gas that is flammable, colorless, and heavier
than air, most often associated with its trade-mark odor of rotten
eggs. Unfortunately the olfactory senses rapidly accommodate to the
odor and the smell is no longer recognized. The sense of smell is not
always reliable or dependable
Exposures to very high concentrations are most often fatal in a
matter of minutes. Exposure to lower concentrations may cause
clinical signs such as nausea, belching and coughing, and eye irritation.
Hydrogen sulfide is found naturally in rotten eggs, decomposing
carcasses, volcanic eruptions, and many bacterial systems. It is used
in various chemical reactions and for purposes such as metallurgy
Organochlorides are chlorinated hydrocarbons, and some are found in
insecticides such as DDT or in other compounds such as chemical warfare agents.
The combination of these compounds and likely others, in the volume
mentioned in the article, may indeed emit enough vapor to be
detrimental to those nearby.- Mod.TG]
