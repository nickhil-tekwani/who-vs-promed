Yosemite National Park authorities have doubled the estimate of those likely infected in a recent outbreak of the hantavirus, a deadly pulmonary disease commonly carried by mice and other rodents. Given the rising number of confirmed cases (currently 8) and deaths (3), U.S. officials have sounded a worldwide alert to more than 22 000 domestic and international visitors to the park who may have been exposed.

Containment of the virus is the 1st priority for the National Park Service, whose officials at 1st estimated that 10 000 people were at risk of contracting the hantavirus [infection] after staying in Yosemite's popular Curry Village lodging area in June through August [2012].

Unfortunately, that 10 000 estimate was low: Officials expanded the warning this week to an additional 12 000 visitors to Yosemite's High Sierra camps, now that the 8th case of hantavirus was confirmed in a man who stayed in those areas. Furthermore, more than 2500 of those individuals are from outside the United States.

The World Health Organization issued a global alert this week in response to the hantavirus cases from Yosemite, urging travelers to avoid rodents at all costs. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said 2 recent visitors to Yosemite are suspected of contracting [the infection] while in the USA. The hantavirus has claimed [the lives of] 3 recent visitors to the park from West Virginia, Pennsylvania and northern California.

Cleanup and containment crews have moved into Yosemite, "spraying the tent cabins with bleach, replacing canvas and insulation, and hammering in new boards," according to park visitor Janna Beck, who came to Yosemite with her family in mid-August 2012 on vacation. "When we checked in, nothing was said to us," Beck said. "We had no clue that anything was going on. There was no word to us, nothing about a rare and deadly disease." When asked whether the construction was just annual maintenance, the worker told Beck that "they were dealing with a mice problem."

Before the 8th victim was discovered, the 1st 7 victims of the hantavirus outbreak were all believed to have contracted the virus while living in one of Yosemite's "Signature" tent cabins in Curry Village, located at a low-elevation area of the park. Yosemite National Park said it had to shut down more than 91 of these "Signature" cabins in Curry Village after deer mice were discovered living within the double walls of the structures.

The 8th and most recent victim said his symptoms were so mild that he never considered going to a hospital. He only decided to get tested on Thursday [6 Sep 2012] after hearing about the outbreak; he may have been lucky he did.

Hantavirus[es], which can typically incubate in humans completely undetected for 2-4 weeks after exposure, have a series of symptoms. In the 1st phase, the patient will experience gastrointestinal and respiratory problems associated with influenza, such as fever, chills, sweaty palms, diarrhea, abdominal pain and general malaise. In phase 2, blood platelet numbers drop for about 2 days. In phase 3, renal failure and proteinuria may occur, which will finally lead to phase 4, which involves diuresis [increased excretion of urine] of 3-6 liters of protein-rich urine each day.

Hantavirus [infection] may not be fatal by itself, but can cause hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, or HPS, which is indeed fatal. The symptoms of HPS are extremely similar to those of hantavirus [infection], but patients will also experience rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, difficulty breathing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Even though HPS was 1st discovered in 1993 and is still a rare occurrence, the syndrome is fatal in about 60 per cent of all cases.

Humans cannot contract [Sin Nombre] hantavirus from one another; hantavirus is, rather, spread by rodents and carried in their urine, feces and saliva. In most cases of hantavirus infection, the virus latches onto dust that gets inhaled by humans. It's easy to see why so many Yosemite visitors could contract this virus, especially as they're living in small, confined tent cabins with relatively poor ventilation surrounded by mice and rodents. Humans can also get infected with hantavirus by touching contaminated surfaces, eating tainted food, or being bitten by an infected rodent.

As of July 2010, 8 states had reported more than 30 cases of hantavirus since its discovery in 1993, mainly in the rural West and Southwest: Arizona, California, Washington, New Mexico, Montana and Texas. With 8 cases found in the last 2 months in one area alone, [cases of] hantavirus [infection] are officially an "outbreak" in the Yosemite region.

According to health authorities, to prevent hantavirus infection, keep rodents out and away from the home. There is no known cure for hantavirus, but survival rates are greatly increased with early detection through blood tests.

[The doubling of the individuals potentially exposed to Sin Nombre hantavirus in Yosemite National Park makes the task of contacting them even more daunting. We can all hold our collective breath for another 2 weeks and hope that no new cases occur. As with the previous reports, the specific hantavirus involved in this case is not stated but is doubtless Sin Nombre virus, which is endemic in California. Its rodent host is the deer mouse, _Peromyscus maniculatus_. The park is prudent to close the Curry Village camp grounds and to caution park visitors about the risk of exposure.

[One hopes that the workers rodent-proofing the cabins are wearing masks, and being monitored for infection. - Mod.JW]
