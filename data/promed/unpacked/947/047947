Cases of meningoencephalitis in California caused by free-living
amoeba
----------------------------------------------------------
Public health officials scramble to determine just how 2 children
contracted amoeba _Balamuthia mandrillaris_. They insisted that the
deaths
are isolated and the public need not fear an outbreak of a disease
that
attacks the brain and is almost always fatal.
"This is rarer than rabies, and people should not feel very
concerned,"
said Dr. Carol Glaser of the California Encephalitis Project in
Richmond,
which specializes in the study of brain-swelling disorders. "This is a
rare
entity in a rare syndrome."
The unusual organism killed 3-year-old A.L.W. on 11 Apr 2001,
3 weeks after she came down with flulike symptoms. And a 7-year-old
Orange
County boy died from the amoeba in March, but health officials there
refused to discuss the case.
Their bewilderment underscores just how little science knows about
_Balamuthia_, which was discovered in 1990 in a mandrill baboon.
Unlike
many amoebas, _Balamuthia_ is not a parasite and does not need a host
to
survive.
Since its discovery, the organism has been diagnosed in about 100
people
around the world, including some 30 people in the United States.
Dr. G.S. Visvesvara, a protozoologist with the CDC, said victims tend
to
have compromised immune systems, aiding the organism in its deadly
course.
"Initially, we believed that all the cases -- and I have had the
opportunity to look at most of them -- were in the very old or very
young,"
he said. "Now we are seeing a few of these cases in (AIDS patients).
So
it's probably immunity-related."

COMMENT:
Carol Glaser, medical officer at the state department of health in
Richmond, says they are still trying to track how the disease is
spread.
"Some people believe it may be inhaled," Glaser says. "It may be
through
cuts in your skin, [and probably then goes into your blood system
and, at
that point, travels to your brain."

[The diagnosis is difficult and depends on microscopy; we assume that
the
diagnosis is correct and confirmed. Free-living amoeba of different
species, including _Balamuthia mandrillaris_ (previously classified as
belonging to _Acanthamoeba_ spp.), are ubiquitous organisms that very
rarely infect humans. As pointed out in the posting above, they are a
special threat to people with compromised immune systems. It is a
possibility that the 2 children infected had some subtle immune
defect. -
