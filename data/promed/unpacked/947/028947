Recently 10 people on Oahu became ill with a rare type of salmonella
after eating imported raw ahi (often used for poke) [Poke (pronounced
"po-keh") means "to slice or cut." As a food dish served as an
appetizer or snack, it usually consists of bite-sized pieces of raw,
fresh fish mixed with seaweed and kukui nut relish
<http://www.aloha-hawaii.com/dining/poke/> - Mod.LL] that was
previously frozen, state health officials reported. The _Salmonella
[enterica_ serotype] Paratyphi B cases occurred between 27 Feb 2010
and 6 Apr 2010 in people ranging in age from 5 to 35, said Janice
Okubo, Department of Health spokeswoman. Half were under age 18 and
the rest were adults, she said. 2 people were hospitalized 1 or 2
days with the infection because of dehydration problems, she said,
adding that none of the cases was serious. All fully recovered, she said.

The state health department has confirmed 10 cases, brought to Hawaii
from another country. 5 other states (California, Maryland,
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York) reported 13 cases of _S._
Paratyphi B infection as of 12 Apr 2010, the Health Department said.

The department said it is working with those states and the US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine whether raw
ahi was involved in those cases. It also has asked the Food and Drug
Administration to investigate international sources of frozen raw ahi.

Hawaii had 35 confirmed cases of _S._ Paratyphi B infection on Oahu
between October 2007 and February 2008. But the strain identified
with the recent 10 cases is different from the one in 2007-08, Okubo
said. They are related but not a molecular match, she said.

The 2007-08 cases were linked with raw imported frozen ahi used in
poke. Similar cases in Colorado and California from eating raw fish
spurred an FDA investigation, but the source could not be identified.

Hawaii has roughly 300 cases of salmonellosis every year and about 10
cases of Paratyphi B, Okubo said. The state had 341 salmonellosis
cases in 2009, including 6 cases of Paratyphi B. So far in 2010, 84
cases of salmonellosis of all types have been confirmed, including
the 10 Paratyphi B cases, Okubo said.

[Although not specifically stated, the serotype here is likely the
d-tartrate fermenting variant _S. enterica_ subspecies _enterica_
serovar Paratyphi B dT+ (sometimes referred to as _S._ Java). This
organism has well characterized animal reservoirs and has been
involved in 2 recent outbreaks reported in ProMED-mail, one in the
USA (Salmonellosis, human, pet turtles - USA 20080125.0317) and the
other in Europe (Salmonellosis, serotype Paratyphi var Java - Europe
20071221.4100).

The organism has been linked to human salmonellosis acquired from
ornamental aquaria (Levings RS, Lightfoot D, Hall RM, et al:
Aquariums as reservoirs for multidrug-resistant _Salmonella_
Paratyphi B. Emerg Infect Dis 2006; 12: 507-10
<http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol12no03/05-1085.htm>).

Outbreaks of human salmonellosis related to fish for eating are
uncommon and are more likely to be related to contamination of the
fish after they are caught.

The yellowfin tuna (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowfin_tuna>)
(_Neothunnus macropterus_) is a type of tuna eaten by humans as food.
It has been reported to be up to 239 cm (94 inches) in length and 200
kg (440 lb) in weight. The fish is also known as 'ahi tuna, after the
Hawaiian word for fire, due to the smoke from their fishing ropes
rubbing violently on the gunwales of their wooden canoes while
pulling the fish in. A picture of this fish can be found at the URL
above. - Mod.LL]
