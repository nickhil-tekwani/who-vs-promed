Alert -- downy mildew found in cucumbers
----------------------------------------
Downy mildew has been found in Delaware and Maryland on cucumbers.
Pickle and other cucumber growers need to start fungicide programs at
this time.

Downy mildew was observed on cucumber in our sentinel plots this
morning (9 Jul 2008) near Georgetown. This indicates that we had a
transport event of spores from the south over the weekend as
predicted by the NC State Plant Disease Forecast Center. We are
recommending that cucumbers be sprayed at this time to protect plants
that are at a vulnerable stage of development.

For other cucurbit crops we are suggesting that you wait until the
disease is seen on crops other than cucumbers. Be sure to be checking
your fields daily especially in areas that had heavy rainfall Sunday
[6 Jul 2008].

Downy mildew confirmed on cucumbers
-----------------------------------
Downy mildew, a highly contagious fungal disease of cucumbers and
other vine crops, has been confirmed in a cucumber field in Monroe County.

Mary Hausbeck, Michigan State University (MSU) professor of plant
pathology, confirmed the finding on 2 Jul [2008]. Though the current
infection is very light and no fungicides have been applied, Hausbeck
recommends that all Michigan cucumber growers should begin spraying
for downy mildew immediately and increase their existing field
monitoring efforts. "Cucumber growers are at immediate risk," she
warns. Hausbeck's research team has downy mildew traps in 3 locations
on the east side of the state and 2 in western Michigan. She says
spores have been detected in all 5 traps.

Storm events that produced substantial rain and high winds in areas
can aid in the diseases spread, she adds. "Downy mildew is not a
disease where you can afford to sit and see what happens," she says.
"It spreads faster than other diseases that affect cucumbers, and
once you have it, it is very difficult to get under control."

[Downy mildew caused by the fungus _Pseudoperonospora cubensis_ is a
devastating disease of cucurbits and has been reported from different
locations worldwide. Different pathovars with variable host
preferences seem to exist, and, for example, a strain that affects
cucumbers may not necessarily affect melons. By affecting the leaves
and thus the photosynthetic potential of its host, downy mildew
reduces yield and fruit quality, and it can eventually kill the host
plant. If appropriate conditions are present, plantings can be
infected so rapidly that they appear to have been frosted.

The fungus survives on cultivated or wild cucurbits, and volunteer
cucurbit crop plants or weeds may serve as sources of inoculum. The
disease is spread by wind, rain splash, and mechanical means. Control
strategies include the use of resistant cultivars as well as
fungicide applications.

Spore traps are used for determining identity and time of dispersal
of fungi. Spores found in traps are identified by morphology to genus
and sometimes species and can indicate the presence of a fungal
pathogen before disease is discovered in the field because symptoms
need time to develop and may initially be difficult to detect. For
more information on spore trapping see links below.
