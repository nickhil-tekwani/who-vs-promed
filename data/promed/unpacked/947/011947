Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: horizontal spread through water
Epidemiological comments: an investigation into scallop health in the Marlborough Sounds performed by the Ministry for Primary Industries identified an incidental finding of the protozoan parasite _Perkinsus olseni_ in New Zealand scallops (_Pecten novaezelandiae_). The notification is based on New Zealand's national Animal Health Laboratory verifying the presence of perkinsus by histopathology and confirming _P. olseni_ via conventional PCR and sequencing. This is the 1st detection of _P. olseni_ in New Zealand scallops (_Pecten novaezelandiae_). _P. olsen_ is known to occur in wild populations of the bivalves _Austrovenus stutchburyi_ (Veneridae), _Macomona liliana_ (Tellinidae), _Barbatia novaezealandiae_ (Arcidae), and _Paphies australis_ (Mesodesmatidae), as well as farmed and wild populations of _Haliotis iris_ (Haliotidae) and has recently been found in a farmed population of green lipped mussels (_Perna canaliculus_) in New Zealand. The Animal Health Laboratory has confirmed that this identification of _Pecten novaezelandiae_ as a susceptible species is in line with chapter 1.5 of the OIE Aquatic Animal Health Code which describes the criteria for listing species as susceptible to a specific pathogen.

Control measures
Measures applied: no vaccination; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[Several species of the genus _Perkinsus_ are responsible for causing perkinsosis in molluscs such as oysters, mussels, clams, and abalone worldwide. _P. olseni_ is the only species known to cause this disease in the Asia-Pacific region and is responsible for perkinsosis in abalone, clams, and pearl oysters. _P. atlanticus_ is a junior synonym of _P. olseni_ (http://bit.ly/13BnhxY). See more information in ProMED-mail posting 20140903.2744165.

The event summary and a map of the previous event are available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?fupser=&dothis=&reportid=15953. The event was resolved on 1 Sep 2014.

_Pecten novaezelandiae_, common name the New Zealand scallop, is a bivalve mollusc of the family Pectinidae, the scallops. The New Zealand scallop is a large industry and export product of New Zealand. The large white adductor muscle is eaten; sometimes, the orange and white gonad is eaten as well. _P. novaezelandiae_ is considered a fine food and can be expensive to purchase. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecten_novaezealandiae

The causal agent of perkinsosis, _P. olseni_, does not pose a risk to human health. - Mod.CRD
