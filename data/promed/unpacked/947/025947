Anthrax is caused by the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_, which is
commonly found in alkaline soil. The bacteria can grow rapidly under
wet soil conditions and then form spores when the soil dries. Changes
in soil moisture, from flooding and drying, can lead to a build-up of
spores on pastures.

[The above piece claims that the pathogen can grow in soil. This has
only been achieved in the laboratory and with sterile soil. See
Minette & Dhanda 1944 -- present-day researcher claims
notwithstanding. In Russia, they had an initial growth but only
after adding blood to the soil, i.e. excess nutrients. - Mod.MHJ]
