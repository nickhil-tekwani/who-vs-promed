Pigeons ARE poultry in China. Nowhere in the coverage is there any hint that the pigeons in question are wild and free-flying, and in 3 visits to various parts of China, I have seen very few pigeons who were not either poultry (most of them) or domestic flocks used in pigeon-racing competitions.

Pigeon-flying is relatively big in China, but much of the habitat is not very favorable to large concentrations of wild pigeons as we know them in the USA. Beijing, for example, is famous for hosting huge numbers of raptors, who hunt pigeons, mice, rats, etc.

The Beijing Raptor Center, one of the most eminent raptor research and rehabilitation facilities in the world, is at Beijing University, right in the middle of the city. Most of their field work is done right within the city limits, because that's where the hawks, owls, and eagles are.

The incredible mixing of species in Chinese live markets might have a great deal to do with H7N9 spreading from whatever the original host species, just as it did with SARS. Here "poultry" means basically chickens, ducks, and geese. In China, besides those 3 species, practically every live market also includes pigeons, quail, pheasants, guinea fowl, and sometimes peafowl, and right next door you'll have open-air pet markets selling captive songbirds, many of them illegally caught from the wild.

All Shanghai markets closed
---------------------------
Shanghai has ordered all live poultry markets in the city closed after culling more than 20 000 birds to curb the spread of the H7N9 flu virus, which has killed 6 people in China. The latest fatality was a 64-year-old farmer who died in Huzhou, in the eastern province of Zhejiang, local officials said on Friday [5 Apr 2013], according to the state Xinhua news agency. He is thought to be among 14 previously confirmed human cases of H7N9 virus infection and is the 2nd person from Zhejiang province to die from the new bird flu strain, with the other 4 fatalities in Shanghai, China's commercial hub.

Shanghai has a population of 23 million people, and city government spokesman Xu Wei said its live poultry markets were being shuttered temporarily for "public safety" purposes, and all trade in live poultry banned.

The moves came after the virus was found in samples from a pigeon from the Huhuai market in Shanghai, where Xinhua said a total of 20 536 chickens, ducks, geese, and pigeons had been slaughtered. On Friday [5 Apr 2013], the entrance to the poultry section was concealed with wooden boards and sealed off with plastic tape, with a police car parked nearby and white disinfectant powder sprinkled in the street. Two staff members at the market told Agence France-Presse that slaughter was completed overnight, but one of them added: "Of course, I'm worried."

"The ministry said last night [4 Apr 2013] that 10 chicken samples from two markets in the Minhang district of Shanghai and at the Huhuai Farm Products Market in
the adjacent Songjiang district had tested positive for H7N9.

The virus was also found in 2 pigeon samples and 7 environmental
samples collected from these markets, out of a total 738 samples tested."

[...and to Ryan for chasing this storm.

The OIE designation of the strain as LPAI (Low pathogenic avian influenza) refers to its mild effect in poultry, not to its lethal effect in humans.
