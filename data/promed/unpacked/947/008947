In the last month, we diagnosed 2 cases of fungal endocarditis in 2 patients who had undergone a similar bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement 5 to 6 months earlier. _Exophiala dermatitidis_ was recovered from standard blood culture system (BACTEC aerobic bottle, Becton Dickinson) after 4-5 days incubation time. Identification was performed through macroscopic and microscopic characteristics, and through MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker). Identification confirmation was obtained from the reference laboratory at the Laboratoire de Sante Publique du Quebec (LSPQ) for the 1st isolate. Investigations are pending.

[_Exophiala dermatitidis_ is an occasional causative agent of phaeohyphomycosis. Subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis is the commonest clinical picture. The infection develops after traumatic implantation of the fungus through the skin. The organism has been associated with various human infections, usually related to traumatic or iatrogenic wounds. Infections have been associated with such risks as peritoneal dialysis, intravenous catheters, and keratoplasty and has been associated with endocarditis in the past, on both native and prosthetic valves (1,2). The organism has also been associated with a small outbreak of fungal meningitis in 2002 (see below) due to a contaminated injectable drug similar to the much larger 2012 exserohilum outbreak.

ProMED-mail thanks Dr Beaudoin and her colleagues for this first-hand contribution as 2 cases of such an unusual infection suggests contamination as well, perhaps related to inadequate sterilization. We would be interested in whether our readers have seen similar cases.
