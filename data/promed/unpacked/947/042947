Since some EcoChallenge participants may still be in the incubation phase
and clinical outcomes can be improved with early treatment, we hope you can
help us get the word out as soon as possible.

GeoSentinel-Outbreak of Leptospirosis in Ecochallenge 2000 Participants
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Within the past 24 hours 3 GeoSentinel sites in London (Hospital for
Tropical Diseases; C. Easmon), New York (Travelers Health Services; B.
Connor), and Toronto (Toronto Hospital Tropical Disease Unit; J. Keystone)
have independently reported clusters totalling 9 participants from the 20
Aug 2000 to 1 Sep 2000 Ecochallenge Adventure race in Borneo with an
illness that on clinical grounds is almost certainly leptospirosis.
GeoSentinel is the global surveillance network of the International Society
of Travel Medicine with 26 sites dispersed throughout the world. In
addition, GeoSentinel has been forwarded e-mail from a [an adventure
racing discussion forum that indicates at least 15 other participants,
including all 4 members of the winning team, from 4 other countries with
similar illnesses.
The high-profile annual EcoChallenge Adventure race this year attracted 78
4-person teams from 22 countries with 44 teams racing around the clock
completing the course in from 6-12 days. The course, in the jungles and off
the coast of Sabah Malaysia included jungle trekking, canoeing, sea
paddling, canyoneering, scuba diving, mountain biking, and caving. The
sponsors' web-site indicates that participants
encountered severely flooded rivers beginning on 25 August 2000. Thus, some
teams might have been exposed to these conditions as late as the beginning
of September.
The patients reported to GeoSentinel consistently had proteinuria, pyuria,
mildly elevated liver enzymes, elevated CPK, and clinical stigmata
including myalgia and fever typical of leptospirosis. Because serological
and culture results are never quickly available, leptospirosis is generally
diagnosed on clinical grounds as has been done by the highly experienced
clinicians in these cases. Other similarly presenting tropical diseases
such as malaria have been ruled out. All ill, febrile patients with a
history of Ecochallenge participation should be treated empirically for
leptospirosis with doxycycline unless another diagnosis is obvious [In
severe infections requiring hospitalization, intravenous penicillin should
be used. -Man. Ed. DS. Because the incubation period can be as long as
2-weeks some participants may still present with new onset illness.

[Leptospirosis has an incubation period ranging from a few days to 4 weeks.
Exposure to water that has been contaminated with the urine of infected
animals is the presumed route of infection in almost all cases.
If these cases are confirmed as leptospirosis, we can look to the
leptospirosis outbreaks associated with the Ironhorse Triathlon and Bally
Total Fitness USTS Triathlon, which both took place in the United States in
1998, to give us a sense of what to expect. These events were associated
with high attack rates among the participants: 11% in the Illinois-only
participants, 5% in the Wisconsin-only participants, and 7% in athletes
participating in both events. If there is a similarly high attack rate from
the EcoChallenge, competitors are likely to present for medical care in
many of the 22 countries fielding teams for the EcoChallenge. For
information on the 1998 triathlon, see CDC. Update: Leptospirosis and
unexplained acute febrile illness among athletes participating in
