Officials say anthrax has been confirmed in South Dakota livestock for the 1st time year this year [2018]. State Veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven has confirmed that eight cows died out of a herd of 87 unvaccinated cattle in Clark County.

The Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory at South Dakota State University confirmed the disease from samples submitted over the weekend.

Anthrax can cause the rapid loss of a large number of animals in a short time. Infected livestock often are found dead with no illness detected. The South Dakota Animal Industry Board says anthrax spores survive indefinitely in contaminated soil. The board says strict enforcement of quarantines and proper burning and burying of carcasses suspected to have died from anthrax is important to prevent further soil contamination from bacterial spores.

[For a county map of South Dakota, go to: http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/southdakota_90.jpg. Clark County is in the eastern half of the state close to the border with Minnesota; see wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_County,_South_Dakota.

While the present incidence of anthrax in South Dakota is truely sporadic -- see reports below -- over the decades most outbreaks have been in eastern South Dakota. So we can presume that this ranch or its immediate neighbours have had outbreaks in the past. And the present unfamiliarity of the ranchers with this disease, thanks in large part to an active policy of annual vaccination by the State Veterinarian and his officers, results in a slow owner response when unexpected deaths occur in, not unexpectedly, an unvaccinated herd. This is such a constant one can count on it whether you are in South Dakota, North Dakota, or Minnesota. Let us hope that this rancher's neighbours take heed and if their stock is not vaccinated, get it done now. With 8 dead cows there was plenty of opportunity for tabanid flies to have fed on them and now be looking for another blood meal. - Mod.MHJ
