The Ministry of Health confirmed on 14 Jan 2008 a 3rd case of YF
in Brazil, and 2nd death since the end of 2007. The fatal case was
a 24-year-old male who reportedly contracted the disease in the
rural area of Goianesa, 150km from the Goias state capital, Goiania,
where he died on 2 Jan 2008 after 5 days in hospital in the
capital. [It is not reported whether he was in a ward screened
against mosquitoes. Mod. JW].

So far in 2008 there have been 26 suspected cases reported, of whom
3 are confirmed, 6 excluded, and 17 are pending lab results. Most
of the cases originated in Goias state.

Brazil informed WHO on 27 Dec 2007 that monkeys were dying of YF
in Brazil. The WHO website now recommends international
tourists visiting affected areas in Brazil get vaccinated against
YF. By Fri 18 Jan 2008, the Ministry of Health will have
distributed 2.2 million doses of YF vaccine to the states of Goias,
Minas Gerais, South Mato Grosso & the Federal District (Brasilia).

At Congonhas airport in Sao Paulo state, a major airline hub
for Brazil, an average of 1000 passengers per day are lining up for
free YF vaccinations [which only take effect after 10 days. ?Mod.JW].

[In this age of real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests,
the 2-week delay in lab confirming YF cases seems excessive, but
the authorities need to be doubly sure of their results in view of
the probable impact on trade and tourism of an urban epidemic
breaking out over Carnaval, the 1st week in February. - Mod.JW
