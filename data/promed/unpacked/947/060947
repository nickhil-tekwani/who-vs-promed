South Korea reported an additional outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease
(FMD) on Sunday [17 Apr 2011], 4 days after downgrading its FMD alert
level one notch.

The farm ministry said 6 pigs at a farm in Yeongcheon, 344 km
southeast of Seoul, tested positive for the highly contagious animal
disease after showing symptoms on Saturday [16 Apr 2011].

The farm has been ordered to cull the contaminated pigs and not to
move its animals, the ministry said, adding it was looking into the
cause of the outbreak.

Last week, the ministry lowered the alert level from "orange" to
"yellow," effectively ending most restrictions on the movement and
sale of livestock in the country, as no new outbreaks of the animal
disease had been reported in 45 days.

Seoul dropped the alert level from the highest level of "red" to
"orange" on 24 Mar 2011.

The downgrade to yellow, the 2nd-lowest level in the 4-tiered alert
system, is a sign that the highly contagious disease that swept
through the country had been contained.

The 1st FMD case was confirmed on 29 Nov 2010, with the last one
before Sunday's [17 Apr 2011] outbreak reported on 26 Feb 2011. Over
that period, Seoul culled more than 3.47 million cows, pigs and other
animals, resulting in losses of 3 trillion won [USD 2.6 billion].

[Laboratory confirmation, including serotyping of the causative agent
as well as information on the vaccination history of the affected
holding, will be helpful.

A follow-up report from North Korea is long overdue (last report
submitted to OIE on 21 Feb 2011). - Mod.AS]
