From: Takahashi, Hiroshi <hat8@cdc.gov>

Yesterday, [the National Infectious Disease Surveillance Center (IDSC) of
Japan announced the current trends of Hand-Foot-Mouth Disease (HFMD) [for
Japan in the July issue of Infectious Agent Surveillance Report (IASR).
<http://idsc.nih.go.jp/iasr/221/inx221.html>
According to the Japanese National Epidemiological Surveillance of
Infectious Diseases, of 2,337 EV71-isolates which were reported from 1982
through 1997, 14 cases developed encephalitis. [There was one death in 1993.
The EV71 strain isolated from fatal cases in Osaka last year was grouped in
"the minor genotype" by the nucleotide sequencing by the Osaka Public
Health Institute and the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID).
The sequence resembled those of the Sarawak strains.
The biggest HFMD epidemic in Japan was observed in 1995. [The epidemic
peaked during the summer, but the disease occurred from autumn to winter
also.
These results indicate that the HFMD vigilance should be tightly maintained
not only in Taiwan, but also surrounding countries, and new information
should be immediately shared through the international surveillance
networks, such as ProMED-mail.
