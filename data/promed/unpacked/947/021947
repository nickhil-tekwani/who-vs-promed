At least 495 people in 30 [US] states have been sickened with parasitic infections from food contaminated with _Cyclospora_.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cilantro imported from Mexico has been identified as the source of illness clusters in Texas and Wisconsin. Investigations are ongoing to determine the source in the remaining 28 [Mexican] states...

In 3 USA states, Texas, Wisconsin, and Georgia, illnesses have been linked to food served at restaurants. But health officials have not released the names of those establishments. [This does not help customers to avoid infection. - Mod.JW]

Cyclosporiasis, the infection caused by the _Cyclospora_ parasite, causes profuse, often explosive, diarrhea that can last 2 months or more. Other symptoms, which can also last more than 60 days, include abdominal cramps, bloating, gas, nausea, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, vomiting, body aches, low-grade fever, and other flu-like symptoms.

2 years ago [2013], _Cyclospora_ in commercial bagged salad mix produced by Taylor Farms of Mexico and served at Olive Garden and Red Lobster restaurants sickened 227 people in Iowa and Nebraska.

[If there are more sources of the infection not yet identified, it is not surprising that the outbreak continues. The outbreak in the United States is probably related to the simultaneous outbreak in Canada. Long-term gastrointestinal symptoms are sometimes seen and are probably due to loss of villi leading to secondary lactose intolerance. Such cases should be managed by a lactose-free diet for a few months. - Mod.EP]

[Infection by _C. cayetanensis_ occurs only in humans and there is no known animal reservoir. Cyclospora has been identified in source waters in various countries including Nepal and Guatemala, wastewater in Tunisia and sewage. http://www.ifst.org/knowledge-centre/information-statements/cyclospora. -Mod.JW
