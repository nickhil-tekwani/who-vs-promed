New York Mumps Outbreak Strikes 57 People
-----------------------------------------
The New York Department of Health has confirmed an outbreak of old
fashioned mumps in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn where at
least 57 confirmed or probable cases have been reported since 21 Aug 2009.

Officials say the outbreak was traced back to a child who went to
Britain, then attended summer camp in upper New York state and
infected fellow campers there who brought the disease back with them
to Brooklyn where it has continued to spread. Most of the victims
have been between the ages of 10 to 15, but the youngest patient so
far was a 1-year-old, while the oldest victim was 42.

Health officials are puzzled over why it is spreading though. While
vaccination rates are low in Britain, at least 75 percent of the
Brooklyn victims had received the normal 2 doses of mumps vaccine.
However, the vaccine only has a 90 percent effective rate.

There is no treatment for the disease that causes painful swelling of
the salivary glands. Mumps usually runs its course in about 10 days.
Complications can lead to deafness or even death and was a childhood
scourge until vaccination largely ended the disease in developed nations.

Mumps is spread by large respiratory droplets of the virus spread
through coughs and sneezes.

[It is likely that this outbreak was initiated by a child (presumably
unvaccinated) who had returned to New York from the United Kingdom
where mumps infection is still widespread due to deficiencies vaccine
coverage (as documented by the ProMED-mail archived reports for 2009
listed below). Subsequent transmission of mumps infection in New York
has embraced 57 people ranging in age from 1 to 42 years. While it is
accepted that the mumps component of the MMR vaccine is less
immunogenic than the other 2 components, and that 2 doses are
recommended, the large number of cases and the wide age range suggest
that there may be a higher proportion of unvaccinated individuals in
the Brooklyn area than elsewhere in the city. This may be a
consequence of negligence or avoidance of vaccination on grounds of
religious or other beliefs. - Mod.CP]
