Porcine myocarditis in Australia
----------------------------------
Emergency report
Information received on 26 Feb 2004 from Dr Gardner Murray, Chief
Veterinary Officer, Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry
Australia (AFFA), Canberra:
Date of the report: 23 Feb 2004.
A new disease syndrome that affects piglets up to 5 weeks of age is
currently being investigated in Australia. The previously unknown
syndrome is called porcine myocarditis (PMC). Its occurrence is
limited to 2 piggeries in New South Wales (NSW), both of which are
owned and operated by the same company.
Diagnostic findings:
Clinically, PMC presents as an increase in stillbirths and
pre-weaning mortalities. There is also a variable but significant
increase in the incidence of mummified foetuses. Initially the
syndrome affected litters from sows of all ages, but it now appears
to be limited to those of young sows carrying their first litter.
The gross pathological changes consist of small pale areas in the
myocardium. There is often evidence of cardiac enlargement and an
increase in the volume of body fluids, consistent with congestive
heart failure.
Histologically there is a non-suppurative myocarditis.
The syndrome is believed to be due to a viral infection occurring
predominantly, if not exclusively, in utero.
Animal health scientists and epidemiologists from the Australian
Animal Health Laboratory, NSW Agriculture, and the Australian
Government Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry have
ascertained that PMC is not a recognised exotic or endemic disease. A
wide range of endemic and exotic viral infections of pigs have been
excluded by laboratory investigations utilising virus isolation,
antigen detection, PCR(1), and serology. Exotic agents that have been
ruled out include foot and mouth disease, porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome, Aujeszky's disease, classical swine fever, and
Menangle virus. A range of endemic agents that have previously been
identified in pigs in some locations in Australia have also been
ruled out, including encephalomyocarditis, porcine parvovirus,
porcine coronavirus (PCV) 1, PCV2 and bovine virus diarrhoea virus.
Electron microscopy on affected myocardium has detected small,
virus-like particles ranging from 19-27 nm.
An unidentified cytopathic agent from several affected pigs' hearts
and lungs has been cultured by virologists at the Elizabeth Macarthur
Animal Institute. The agent is fastidious in its growth requirements.
Further work is under way (a) to establish that the isolate is, in
fact, associated with the disease and (b) to characterise it.
The epidemiology and clinical expression of this disease is
consistent with the introduction or emergence of a new infectious
agent into a fully susceptible population.
Control measures:
The affected properties are under movement controls with strict
protocols in place.
The disease has been listed as a notifiable disease under the NSW
Stock Diseases Act.
Current status:
The condition is resolving and piglet losses due to the disease are
approaching zero.
No impact on human health or food safety has been identified. Pigs
grown to market weight have shown no sign of the disease at slaughter.
Research continues in order to identify the exact cause of PMC.

[There is a nice summary and website references provided in the most
recent reference below. The report of a new virus in swine reminds
us that new syndromes, often manifesting reproductive loss, occur
periodically in swine. A new virus like this can sometimes cause
enormous economic impact, as was the case for PRRS (Porcine
Reproductive and Respiratory Disease), which began to make its global
appearance in the early 1990s. The important question now that we
have identified the emergence of a disease in the Australian swine
population is how far and fast will it spread, if at all. - Mod.PC]
