Supermarkets in Australia recalled batches of baby spinach after over 100 people experienced hallucinations with at least 54 requiring medical attention after consuming the vegetable. Authorities believe the spinach caused toxic reactions due to contamination, The New York Times reported on [Sun 18 Dec 2022].

Those affected experienced symptoms such as delirium, blurred vision, dilated pupils, nausea and vomiting, rapid heartbeat, hallucinations, fever, and confusion. "They're unable to see properly, they're confused, they're having hallucinations. And we're talking about scary hallucinations; it's nothing that's fun," Darren Roberts, the medical director of New South Wales's Poisons Information Center, said in an interview on Australian television.

The leafy vegetables, produced in Riviera Farms, are said to be contaminated with a weed, resulting in severe symptoms. The baby spinach was shipped to Victoria in the Australian Capital Territory, which includes Canberra and New South Wales.

A release by the Health Department of Victoria said the symptoms suggest anticholinergic syndrome, which is caused by substances present in plants like mandrake root, nightshade, and Samson weed from the Solanaceae family.

Plants and drugs containing anticholinergic elements lower or stop the production of acetylcholine, a type of neurotransmitter aiding in thinking, memory, and the visual system, Dominic Fftytche, a professor of visual psychiatry at King's College in London, told the publication. Loss of acetylcholine is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and types of dementia, he added.

Hallucinations caused by acetylcholine loss take a more solid appearance -- where the patients see distinct people, places, and things -- as opposed to 'unformed' hallucinations, where patients see shapes, colours, and patterns. Since acetylcholine is an integral part of the memory system, hallucinations caused by its absence tend to feature people or places the patient knows or is familiar with. It could include the patient's "deceased relatives or people vaguely familiar to them in some way," Dr Ffytche said. "When you lose an understanding they are hallucinations, they tend to become distressing. You become sucked into the story where something bad is going on and people are trying to hurt you or harm you in some way," he explained.

Though anticholinergic syndrome may not be fatal, it can lead to extreme symptoms and severe effects.
