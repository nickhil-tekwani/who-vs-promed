We have just had the pleasure of a seminar by Dr Louise MacFarland,
Louisiana State Epidemiologist, on this outbreak.
To date there have been 17 cases ... Jefferson Parish (12), Lafayette (3),
Orleans Parish (1), St. Tammany Parish (1). The last case became ill
on 12 Sep 1998. There are presently no suspects awaiting laboratory confirmation.
With the exception of the St. Tammany case, a 6-year-old, the rest were from
24 yo to 72yo. The cases in Jefferson were clustered broadly in the
area known as Kenner.
It is expected that there will be no more cases as the _Culex
quinquefasciatus_ season is essentially over, but the hurricane weather has
resulted in an extraordinary number of mosquitoes currently.
One interesting component was that they were under nagging pressure from two
local physicians to stop the children's soccer games in Kenner, normally
played in the late afternoon. The PH Department responded by issuing flyers
to all the children, their parents, and the coaches informing them of the
risk from mosquitoes. The games continued at the previous intensity, without
cases. It should be noted that the area had been well fogged, and
surveillance of mosquito pools revealed no viruses.
