No RVF Cases Among Humans
-------------------------
No Rift Valley Fever (RVF) cases have so far been reported among
humans in the southern Jizan region, the Health Ministry announced
yesterday.
"We have inspected all patients admitted to King Fahd Hospital in
Jizan and the General Hospital in Aaridha. We did not find any
suspected RVF cases among them," said Dr. Tariq ibn Ahmed Madani, an
internist and adviser to Health Minister Dr. Hamad Al-Manie.
Madani was a member of the ministry's team who recently visited the
region on the instructions of Al-Manie following reports that 5
animals in the region tested positive for the deadly virus.
Dr. Yaaqub Al-Mazroue, assistant deputy health minister for
preventive medicine, also visited Jizan soon after reports of fresh
RVF outbreak in the region.
Mazroue inspected the arrangements made by the Health Ministry to
prevent the spread of the disease as well as the progress of work at
disease combat centers. Madani said his team checked all the files
of patients admitted at Jizan hospitals for the past 3 months to make
sure whether they were infected with RVF virus or not. The team also
visited the laboratory of the Agriculture Ministry and met with
veterinarians and other experts there as well as the areas where the
5 cases were reported.
"The results of field trips and clinical tests have proved that there
are no suspected RVF cases among humans in the region," the Saudi
Press Agency quoted Madani as saying.
Madani also said there were no deaths or abortions among cattle in
the region as a result of the RVF outbreak. He said the numbers of
mosquitoes had been brought down as a result of continuous spraying
of insecticides. "We have also intensified health awareness campaign
among the people of Jizan," the official said, adding that the
authorities had taken precautions to prevent the spread of the
disease.
Agriculture Minister Dr. Fahd Balghaneim reported on Monday that 5
animals in Jizan (4 in Abu Areesh and one in Aaridah) tested positive
for RVF during periodic examinations. "These positive results from the
tests do not mean that the situation in the region has reached
epidemic proportions," Balghaneim said.
The minister urged the authorities to be cautious about the RVF
virus, which is capable of surviving in the eggs of mosquitoes for a
long time and can surface whenever it finds a hospitable environment.
The Agriculture Ministry has set up an early warning unit to monitor
and contain infectious diseases affecting agricultural and animal
resources in certain regions before they spread to other parts of the
Kingdom.
RVF primarily affects animals but occasionally causes illness in
humans, in whom it leads to high morbidity and mortality.

[For many years it was thought that RVF infected only people who came
into close contact with contaminated animal tissue, while animals
were primarily infected by arthropod vectors. Most of the people
involved were farmers, farm laborers, and abattoir personnel. Similar
observations were made during the 1977/78 major outbreak in Egypt,
though vector transmission there became more significant than before.
Exposure of humans to infected animal tissues may specifically occur
when exposed to blood aerosols during the slaughter of viraemic
animals. This was one of the concerns of the Saudi authorities in
2000, in view of the massive slaughtering of ruminants during the
Moslem holidays. Such a situation might recur during the coming Eid
al-Fitr holiday, also called Eid al Zeghir (minor festival). Eid
al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting,
and is celebrated during the first 3 days of Shawwal, the 10th month
of the Islamic calendar. During these days, house slaughtering of
ruminants, mainly sheep and goats, is widely practiced, especially in
rural areas. Eid al-Fitr is due this year on 14-15 November -- a
season characterised by intense vector activity in the Near East.
Vector control activities might help, but timely mass vaccination of
susceptible ruminants is essential in order to prevent the
establishment of RVF in animals and the subsequent public health
hazard. - Mod.AS]
[It is not at all clear that this is an outbreak, yet. Dr Madani is quoted as
saying "5 animals in Jizan... tested positive for RVF during periodic
examinations." This was presumably a serological test for antibody, which the
animals concerned -- depending on their ages -- might well have acquired from
an infection in the 2001 epidemic, or they could have been imported from a
neighboring country (such as Yemen) suffering from an unrecognised outbreak.
The lack of reports of sick or dead animals or abortions in livestock does
not suggest that there is a current epizootic, but the Saudi authorities are
quite right to take preventive action, to protect both their livestock &
human population from the threat. - Mod.JW]
