The Dutch onion yield forecast has been adjusted downwards. An abundance of onions was expected earlier, but now volumes are down due to a combination of heavy rainfall, mildew, and leaf spot disease.

[A large number of fungal, bacterial, and nematode pathogens, as well as several viruses and phytoplasmas, are known to affect onion (_Allium cepa_) and related crops. Most of the major pathogens of this crop are soil borne and favoured by humid conditions.

The diseases include 2 types of mildews: powdery mildew caused by fungi in the genus _Leveillula_; and downy mildew caused by fungus-like oomycetes in the genus _Peronospora_. Leaf spots are associated with a number of diseases affecting the crop; they can be due to either bacteria (such as _Pseudomonas_ or _Xanthomonas_ species), or fungal pathogens (such as _Glomerella_, _Alternaria_ or _Stemphylium_ spp.). It is not clear specifically which of these diseases are referred to above.

Reliable diagnosis of the particular pathogens associated with the problems is needed before any management strategies can be designed.
