A 47-year-old man from Arapahoe County has tested positive for
hantavirus [infection], the Tri- County Health Department reported
Friday [5 Sep 2008]. The man, who was not identified, was
hospitalized and later released.

Health officials said the man was most likely exposed to a hantavirus
while inspecting rodent-infested buildings on an abandoned property
in eastern Arapahoe County.

This is the 1st confirmed case this year [2008] in Tri-County's
jurisdiction of Adams, Arapahoe, and Douglas Counties and the 6th
hantavirus [infection] case in Colorado, including one fatality.

Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome is a rare disease that is carried by
rodents, especially deer mice. People catch the disease by inhaling
dust containing airborne [virus] particles from the feces, urine, or
saliva of deer mice. It is fatal to humans in almost half the cases.

According to the health department, initial symptoms usually appear
about 2-3 weeks after exposure and include fever, chills, headache,
and severe muscle pain, especially in the lower back and legs. One to
5 days later, symptoms include a dry cough or difficulty breathing,
and can lead to respiratory failure.

[Although the identity of the hantaviruses involved in this and
previous 2008 Colorado cases of hantavirus infection was not
specified in this report, most likely it was Sin Nombre hantavirus,
which is closely associated with _Peromyscus maniculatus_.
