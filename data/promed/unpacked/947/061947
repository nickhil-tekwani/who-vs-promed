[1] Aspergillus superinfection: COVID-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA)
Date: 22 Mar 2021

COVID-19 brings thousands of people into hospitals every day, but their coronavirus infections are not always the direct reason they die. Dangerous secondary infections by opportunistic pathogens are common in intensive care units, and physicians are raising the alarm about a particular microbial threat to COVID-19 patients: a common fungus known as Aspergillus.

Emerging evidence suggests that infection with SARS-CoV-2 -- and possibly the drugs used to treat it -- makes COVID-19 patients especially vulnerable to Aspergillus. The threat, which also surfaced during the 2009 flu pandemic, is leading some researchers to urge more careful fungal surveillance of the sickest COVID-19 patients and treatment with antifungal drugs.

Aspergillus "is ubiquitous; you can't avoid it," says George Thompson, an infectious disease physician at the University of California, Davis. Members of its genus produce spores that can float in the air, and "we breathe in hundreds to thousands or more [of them] per day," he says.

Those spores normally don't harm us. Aspergillus infections were typically considered a threat only to immunocompromised patients, such as those undergoing cancer treatments or bone marrow transplants. But in 2009, doctors saw a spike in previously healthy people who succumbed to Aspergillus. They had all 1st become sick with a new, pandemic strain of the influenza virus H1N1.

For reasons scientists still don't completely understand, influenza infections appear to make the fungus more deadly in people with a seemingly normal immune system. In a 2016 review of 57 cases of Aspergillus infections in influenza patients reported since 1963, Nancy Crum-Cianflone, an infectious disease specialist at Scripps Mercy Hospital, found that about half of the co-infected patients died.

Now, something similar may be happening with COVID-19. Just as H1N1 was a severe strain of influenza, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is an especially dangerous form of coronavirus, Crum-Cianflone says. That could help explain why it leaves COVID-19 patients vulnerable to new threats.

Data on Aspergillus infections in people with COVID-19 are still sparse, but case reports point to worrying trends. One study from Germany found that 1/4th of critically ill COVID-19 patients also had Aspergillus infections. Another study of COVID-19 patients on ventilators found probable Aspergillus in 1/3rd of them.

It's not uncommon for COVID-19 patients to be infected with other harmful microbes. But Aspergillus may be the deadliest threat among them, says Adilia Warris, a medical mycologist at the University of Exeter. She points to a recent study of 186 COVID-19 patients from around the world who also had Aspergillus. It found that slightly more than 50% of them died, and roughly 1/3rd of those deaths were linked to Aspergillus infections.

Thompson estimates that anywhere between 2% and 10% of severely ill COVID-19 patients at his hospital also have an Aspergillus infection. "It's obviously a minority of patients," he says. "But the complications of a secondary infection are generally pretty substantial."

Doctors say there are a few reasons why having COVID-19 might be an especially strong risk factor for an Aspergillus infection. One is that while COVID-19 can send parts of the immune system into overdrive, it also depletes certain immune cells, leaving a patient less able to fight off other infections. The extreme damage to cells lining the lung also impairs the organ's ability to clear out respiratory pathogens like Aspergillus, Thompson says.

The way physicians treat COVID-19 could also heighten the risk of an Aspergillus infection. The steroid dexamethasone, shown to improve survival rates among severely ill COVID-19 patients, calms an overactive immune response that can lead to dangerous inflammation and organ damage. But immunosuppressive steroids are a double-edged sword, Crum-Cianflone says, leaving the door open to other infections. A recent observational study of 4 COVID-19 patients with likely Aspergillus infections noted that 3 of them had received higher steroid doses than was recommended; all of them died.

If doctors could easily identify Aspergillus infections, available antifungal drugs could fight them. But because the fungus can cause nonspecific symptoms such as coughing and shortness of breath that are already common in COVID-19 patients, doctors don't always look for it. A bronchoscopy, in which doctors snake a tube from the nose or mouth into the lungs, is the best way of taking lung samples for analysis. But the procedure isn't typically done on COVID-19 patients for fear of spreading viral particles. And even a positive test may not mean the fungus is doing damage; Aspergillus can also be present in the lungs as a harmless colonizer.

As a preventive measure, Crum-Cianflone has begun giving severely ill COVID-19 patients antifungal drugs after their 3rd week of hospitalization, even if they haven't tested positive for Aspergillus. But even that strategy has risks. Overusing these compounds could lead to drug-resistant strains of Aspergillus becoming more common, Warris notes.

Recently, in The Lancet, an international group of physicians and medical mycology societies laid out recommendations for diagnosing Aspergillus infections in COVID-19 patients, including doing lung imaging scans and taking samples from the lungs at regular intervals for testing. The hope is that the guidelines will help COVID-19 doctors know whether they're battling one deadly pathogen or 2.

[There is increasing literature on the occurrence of invasive fungal infections complicating COVID-19 cases. COVID-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) as well as invasive _Candida albicans_ infections have been reported. Invasive aspergillosis is usually associated with profound immunosuppression, such as with bone marrow or solid organ transplant, and the use of corticosteroids and tocilizumab are clearly contributors to CAPA. An excellent review appeared in EID in February 2021 and consensus guidelines in Lancet Infectious Diseases in December 2020:

"Salmanton-Garcia J, Sprute R, Stemler J, et al. COVID-19-Associated Pulmonary Aspergillosis, March-August 2020. Emerging Infectious Diseases. 2021;27(4):1077-1086. doi:10.3201/eid2704.204895.

"Abstract
Pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 emerged in China at the end of 2019. Because of the severe immunomodulation and lymphocyte depletion caused by this virus and the subsequent administration of drugs directed at the immune system, we anticipated that patients might experience fungal superinfection. We collected data from 186 patients who had coronavirus disease-associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) worldwide during March-August 2020. Overall, 182 patients were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), including 180 with acute respiratory distress syndrome and 175 who received mechanical ventilation. CAPA was diagnosed a median of 10 days after coronavirus disease diagnosis. _Aspergillus fumigatus_ was identified in 80.3% of patient cultures, 4 of which were azole-resistant. Most (52.7%) patients received voriconazole. In total, 52.2% of patients died; of the deaths, 33.0% were attributed to CAPA. We found that the cumulative incidence of CAPA in the ICU ranged from 1.0% to 39.1%."

"Abstract:
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causes direct damage to the airway epithelium, enabling aspergillus invasion. Reports of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis have raised concerns about it worsening the disease course of COVID-19 and increasing mortality. Additionally, the 1st cases of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis caused by azole-resistant aspergillus have been reported. This article constitutes a consensus statement on defining and managing COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis, prepared by experts and endorsed by medical mycology societies. COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis is proposed to be defined as possible, probable, or proven on the basis of sample validity and thus diagnostic certainty. Recommended 1st-line therapy is either voriconazole or isavuconazole. If azole resistance is a concern, then liposomal amphotericin B is the drug of choice. Our aim is to provide definitions for clinical research and up-to-date recommendations for clinical management of the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19-associated pulmonary aspergillosis.

"Key messages
- The increasing number of reports on COVID-19-associated invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA) raise concerns about this superinfection as an additional contributing factor to mortality.
- The European Confederation for Medical Mycology and the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology instituted a group of experts to propose consensus criteria for a case definition of CAPA and to provide up-to-date management recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with CAPA
- Three different grades are proposed (i.e., possible, probable, and proven CAPA) to enable researchers to homogeneously classify patients in registries and interventional clinical trials
- Voriconazole or isavuconazole are recommended as 1st-line treatment for possible, probable, and proven CAPA
- Over time, new insights will be used to further improve the definitions and the management algorithms." - Mod.LM]

[2] Long Covid

[A] Magnitude of health burden
Date: 26 Mar 2021

https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2021/03/news-scan-mar-26-2021


Researchers reporting on 2 non-peer-reviewed studies published this week on the preprint server medRxiv followed up months after adults' COVID-19 hospitalization and found that 55% to 71% have not fully recovered. Middle age and female sex were associated with a higher likelihood of worse recovery in both studies.

The larger study involved 1077 UK patients (median age, 58) a median of 5 months after hospital discharge. While 28.8% felt fully recovered, 19.6% had a new disability, 17.8% of those who were working in full- or part-time capacity no longer were, and 19.3% had undergone a health-related change in occupation. Additionally, 1 in 4 had clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression, 12.2% had post-traumatic stress disorder, 17% had mild cognitive impairment, and 46% had lower physical performance.

Factors associated with worse recovery included female sex, white ethnicity, and having 2 or more comorbidities. The researchers noted that age had a nonlinear association: Compared with those 50 to 59, those younger than 30 or older than 70 were 2.28 times and at least 2.07 times more likely to recover, respectively.

"The magnitude of the ongoing mental and physical health burden was substantial, but perhaps surprisingly were largely unrelated to acute severity," the researchers write.

Abstract
Background The impact of COVID-19 on physical and mental health, and employment following hospitalisation is poorly understood.

Methods
PHOSP-COVID is a multi-centre, UK, observational study of adults discharged from hospital with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 involving an assessment between 2- and 7-months later including detailed symptom, physiological and biochemical testing. Multivariable logistic regression was performed for patient-perceived recovery with age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, and severity of acute illness as co-variates. Cluster analysis was performed using outcomes for breathlessness, fatigue, mental health, cognition and physical function.

Findings
We report findings of 1077 patients discharged in 2020, from the assessment undertaken a median 5 [IQR4 to 6] months later: 36% female, mean age 58 [SD 13] years, 69% white ethnicity, 27% mechanical ventilation, and 50% had at least 2 co-morbidities. At follow-up, only 29% felt fully recovered, 20% had a new disability, and 19% experienced a health-related change in occupation. Factors associated with failure to recover were female, middle-age, white ethnicity, 2 or more co-morbidities, and more severe acute illness. The magnitude of the persistent health burden was substantial and weakly related to acute severity. Four clusters were identified with different severities of mental and physical health impairment: 1) Very severe (17%), 2) Severe (21%), 3) Moderate with cognitive impairment (17%), 4) Mild (46%), with 3%, 7%, 36% and 43% feeling fully recovered, respectively. Persistent systemic inflammation determined by C-reactive protein was related to cluster severity, but not acute illness severity.

Interpretation
We identified factors related to recovery from a hospital admission with COVID-19 and 4 different phenotypes relating to the severity of physical, mental, and cognitive health 5 months later. The implications for clinical care include the potential to stratify care and the need for a pro-active approach with wide access to COVID-19 holistic clinical services (Clinical Trial: ISRCTN10980107).

[B] Neurologic Symptoms in Non-Hospitalized COVID-19 Long-Haulers
Date: Tue 23 Mar 2021

https://www.nm.org/about-us/northwestern-medicine-newsroom/press-releases/2021/neurologic-symptoms-in-non-hospitalized-covid-19-long-haulers
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acn3.51350 [full article]


A new Northwestern Medicine study published in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology analyzed 100 non-hospitalized COVID-19 long-haulers and discovered 85% of patients experienced 4 or more neurologic symptoms which impacted their quality of life, and in some patients, their cognitive abilities.

The study sought to characterize the range of neurologic manifestations in the 1st 100 non-hospitalized COVID-19 long-haulers from 21 states who were seen in person or via telehealth at the Neuro COVID-19 Clinic, part of the Comprehensive COVID-19 Center at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, from May to November 2020.

"Our study is the 1st to report neurologic findings in non-hospitalized COVID-19 long-haulers, including detailed neurologic exam, diagnostic testing, and validated measures of patient quality of life, as well as cognitive function test results," says Igor Koralnik, MD, chief of Neuro-infectious Diseases and Global Neurology in the Ken & Ruth Davee Department of Neurology at Northwestern Medicine, who also oversees the Neuro COVID-19 Clinic.

"At the beginning of the pandemic, patients with mild disease often didn't qualify for nasal swab or serology testing. Because of this, we included 50 long-haulers with laboratory-positive tests and 50 with laboratory-negative tests. All patients in this study had clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but only had mild and transient respiratory symptoms (sore throat, cough, mild fever) and never developed pneumonia or low oxygen levels requiring hospitalization."

For the purposes of the study, the Northwestern Medicine Neuro COVID-19 research group defined long COVID-19 as symptoms lasting more than 6 weeks, given the majority of patients fully recover by 4-6 weeks.

Of the 100 non-hospitalized COVID-19 long-haulers who participated in the study:
- Average age was 43
- 70% were female
- 85% reported at least 4 neurologic symptoms.

Most frequent neurologic symptoms: Brain fog (81%), Headache (68%), Numbness/tingling (60%), Disorder of taste (59%), Disorder of smell (55%), Muscle pain (55%), Dizziness (47%), Pain (43%), Blurred vision (30%), Tinnitus (29%).

Most frequent non-neurologic symptoms: Fatigue (85%), Depression/anxiety (47%), Shortness of breath (46%), Chest pain (37%), Insomnia (33%), Variation of heart rate and blood pressure (30%), Gastrointestinal symptoms (29%).

Most common comorbidities prior to COVID-19 diagnosis: Depression/anxiety (42%), Autoimmune disease (16%), Insomnia (16%), Lung disease (16%), Headache (14%).

"We were surprised by the number of patients who were suffering from depression/anxiety before their COVID-19 diagnosis, and this suggests a possible neuropsychiatric vulnerability to developing long COVID," says Dr. Koralnik.

With 70% of patients being women and 16% having a pre-existing autoimmune disorder, Dr. Koralnik notes that it resembles the female-to-male ratio of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (2:1) and rheumatoid arthritis (3:1). Compared to those with positive test results of COVID-19, long-haulers with negative test results came in on average one month later to the clinic.

"This may have been caused by the difficulty for these patients to find medical providers, since they do not fit into classical diagnostic criteria of COVID-19," adds Dr. Koralnik. "This is reminiscent of the stigma experienced by women with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic gold standards for COVID-19 infection, which our group hopes to address by elucidating the T cell response of long-haulers against COVID-19 proteins."

Many patients reported fluctuating symptoms lasting for months; for example, when asked to estimate their percentage of recovery compared to their pre-COVID-19 baseline, patients reported to feel only 64% recovered on average after 5 months. While most patients tend to improve over time, there are still long-haulers who continue to experience symptoms more than 9 months later.

"We are already performing cognitive rehab in some patients and are considering a variety of therapeutic interventions," says Dr. Koralnik. "We are also evaluating long-lasting neurologic symptoms across larger groups of COVID-19 patients including those with a history of hospitalization for severe illness. Future extended studies are needed to evaluate the cognitive impacts on long-haulers and devise appropriate treatment options."

In October 2020, the Northwestern Medicine Neuro COVID-19 research group also published a study in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology that analyzed 509 hospitalized COVID-19 patients and discovered neurologic manifestations happened 82% at any time during the course of the disease.

"Abstract
Objective
Most SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected individuals never require hospitalization. However, some develop prolonged symptoms. We sought to characterize the spectrum of neurologic manifestations in non‐hospitalized Covid‐19 "long haulers."

"Methods
This is a prospective study of the 1st 100 consecutive patients (50 SARS‐CoV‐2 laboratory‐positive and 50 laboratory‐negative individuals) presenting to our Neuro‐Covid‐19 clinic between May and November 2020. Due to early pandemic testing limitations, patients were included if they met Infectious Diseases Society of America symptoms of Covid‐19, were never hospitalized for pneumonia or hypoxemia and had neurologic symptoms lasting over 6 weeks. We recorded the frequency of neurologic symptoms and analyzed patient‐reported quality of life measures and standardized cognitive assessments.

"Results
[see news report above]

"Interpretation
Non‐hospitalized Covid‐19 'long haulers' experience prominent and persistent 'brain fog' and fatigue that affect their cognition and quality of life."

[This observational study suggests an auto-immune mechanism, as well as the possibility of infection or inflammation of endothelial cells of brain vessels (endotheliitis). The investigators suggest that the "brain fog," that is often reported following infection, which may also be accompanied with fatigue, might represent a mild form of post-Covid-19 encephalopathy.

The question why most "long haulers are women" was addressed in a report, https://www.businessinsider.com/most-coronavirus-long-haulers-women-immune-response-2021-3:

"We are seeing men who seem to recover a little bit more quickly than women, and I'm not sure why that is," said Dr. Noah Greenspan, DPT, founder of the Pulmonary Wellness Foundation's COVID Rehab & Recovery Program at H&D Physical Therapy program.

It's not altogether surprising that women who get COVID-19 die at lower rates than men but struggle with more long-term symptoms. Women live longer than men on average -- which might be due to biological characteristics like a stronger immune response, though the science is far from settled -- but are also more likely to develop autoimmune diseases like lupus, Crohn's, or rheumatoid arthritis.

Some researchers think the reasons for this difference are genetic: X chromosomes contain more immune-related genes than the Y chromosome. X chromosomes also hold more genes in general, creating more opportunities for mutations that could lead to an autoimmune disease. Additionally, studies have found that women have more of a gene called VGLL3 that could prompt the immune system to attack itself.

Sex hormones, too, could play a role. Estrogen helps regulate the immune response, so when estrogen levels are low, the female immune system may react too aggressively to the coronavirus. That may help explain why 77% of female long-haulers in a UK survey said their symptoms were worse prior to or during their periods, when hormone levels are at their lowest.

"We do see a lot of women during their menstrual cycles or before their menstrual cycles having, certainly, an increase in symptoms, but what the exact mechanism is, I don't think we know," Greenspan said. - Mod.LK]

[3] Asymptomatic Transmission
Date: Fri 26 Mar 2021
Source: Science Mag [edited]
https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6535/1206


Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a potentially long incubation period and spreads opportunistically among those who are unaware they are infected. Asymptomatic COVID-19 cases are those that do not develop symptoms for the duration of infection, whereas pre-symptomatic cases develop symptoms later in the course of infection, but both are crucial drivers of transmission.

Transmission without symptoms poses specific challenges for determining the infectious timeline and potential exposures. Early in the pandemic, most transmission was from undocumented cases, suggesting that spread was driven by people who were either asymptomatic or experiencing such mild disease that it was not recognized as COVID-19.

Contagious people without observable signs of illness make infection prevention efforts vulnerable to compliance with masking, distancing, hand hygiene, symptom screening, and ultimately, people staying home when possible. The lack of widespread testing in asymptomatic individuals further complicates COVID-19 mitigation and control efforts.

The true occurrence and transmission capacity of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections are difficult to evaluate. Owing to insufficient surveillance testing (testing regardless of symptoms), pre-symptomatic cases lost to follow up, and unrecognized mild symptoms, symptomless cases are often undercounted or misclassified. It is virtually impossible to detect such cases without continuous community surveillance screening, which has not been widely implemented, or without effective contact tracing and testing.

Beyond implementing general and often vague control measures, public health efforts have struggled to truly address symptomless transmission. Surveillance testing has predominantly been carried out in targeted populations such as long-term care facilities. Only certain industries, such as professional sports and entertainment, have implemented asymptomatic testing, but such data are not publicly available, and these groups are not representative of the broader community.

It is important to understand infectiousness and viral shedding, as well as the overall contribution of asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic cases to secondary cases.

The prevalence of symptomless cases is not precisely established. Early studies reported that asymptomatic cases accounted for 30 to 80% of infections, but more recent data point to a rate of asymptomatic cases between 17 and 30%. A recent systematic review of studies reporting SARS-CoV-2 diagnoses by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR, the standard molecular diagnostic test) and follow-up of symptoms found that the proportion of asymptomatic infections was 20% and that the rate of pre-symptomatic individuals could not be determined because of heterogeneity across studies (4).

A limitation of such studies is measurement of asymptomatic status and selection bias. Often, large outbreaks driven by asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic transmission are restricted to specific populations or circumstances, such as in skilled nursing or long-term care facilities, where surveillance testing takes place. Because these are high-risk clinical environments, it is not surprising that symptomless transmission has been detected more frequently than in nonclinical settings, such as restaurants or offices, which lack access to testing or medically trained staff.

The unknown prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections makes disease control and mitigation strategies inherently challenging. Beyond assessing the prevalence of symptomless infections, it is vital to determine their risk for secondary transmission. Contact tracing is reliant on case identification, which generally involves testing of people with symptoms. This reliance on symptom-based testing, especially early in the pandemic, was also complicated by limited understanding of the full range of COVID-19 symptoms.

The lack of surveillance testing makes analysis of secondary attack rates (the percentage of cases that result from one infected person within a defined group) for asymptomatic cases exceedingly difficult. In symptomatic COVID-19, infectiousness begins 2 days prior to symptom onset and for several days after, with reduced or undetectable viral shedding within the 1st week of symptom onset. Viral shedding kinetics for asymptomatic COVID-19 are not well understood. Early in infection, individuals have similar viral loads regardless of eventual symptom severity, but asymptomatic cases have lower titers at peak replication, faster viral clearance, and thus a shorter infectious period.

Measuring the true impact of symptomless infections on transmission can be extremely confounding. Data on asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases who had close contacts but did not result in transmission are limited. Some studies found that asymptomatic cases were 42% less likely to transmit the virus, and observed lower secondary attack rates, whereas others have noted that regardless of a shorter infectious period, there is similar transmissibility for those with pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic COVID-19 in the 1st days of infection. Studies of pre-symptomatic transmission suggest that higher secondary attack rates are likely compared with asymptomatic cases. Moreover, analyses of contact tracing data indicated that at least 65% of transmission occurs prior to symptom onset. Another study found that only 12.6% of cases resulted from symptomless transmission. These discrepancies can be explained by several factors, including the misclassification of cases that were not followed up, but also that many are identified as a result of specific settings, such as superspreading events on cruise ships or in choir practice that result in rigorous investigations, and may not be representative of typical transmission events.

Determining the true transmission capability of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases is inherently complex, but knowledge gaps should not detract from acknowledging their role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Those with symptoms appear to have higher secondary attack rates, but these cases are also more likely to present for testing and practice isolation because of obvious illness. The public health and infection prevention challenges rely on those without symptoms to self-quarantine and implement a suite of interventions, such as masking, social distancing, ventilation, and hand hygiene. However, emphasis on the degree of contagiousness rather than the knowledge that people without symptoms are generally contagious detracts from the public health threat that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic infections pose and the need for continuous community-based surveillance and interventions.

The 2003 outbreak of the related SARS-CoV was eventually contained by using standard epidemiological approaches of isolating cases and tracing and quarantining contacts. This was effective because contagious patients could be easily identified through temperature and symptom screening. A major distinction from SARS-CoV is viral shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in the absence of observable clinical symptoms. Unlike SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 viral loads are highest at symptom onset and up to a week after, which suggests substantial pre-symptomatic shedding. Therefore, people are likely contagious for a relatively long period and when they are unaware that they have been infected or exposed. The minimum infectious dose required for transmission is also not known and likely varies depending on individual exposure and susceptibility. Although viral loads decline over the course of infection, the exact point at which someone stops being contagious is unclear, but probably occurs within 10 days of infection in most cases, provided symptoms are resolving.

Testing provides limited clarity on whether a person is likely to be contagious on the basis of estimated viral loads. Although people who have fully recovered from COVID-19 can continue to shed viral RNA and test positive by qRT-PCR in the absence of recoverable infectious SARS-CoV-2, as assessed by culture, these cases have not been associated with new clusters of transmission. qRT-PCR detects viral RNA but not infectious virus particles. PCR cycle thresholds can be used to estimate viral load in nasal swabs, but do not always directly correlate with the quantity of infectious virus shed in respiratory particles. These particles are highly heterogeneous depending on various factors, including where in the respiratory tract cells are secreting infectious virus, breathing rate, and symptoms such as coughing. Not all exhaled particles contain infectious virus, and the amount of time that virus remains infectious after exhalation in respiratory particles can vary substantially depending on environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, as well as the quantity of infectious particles being shed. Assays that measure infectious titer must be performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) containment, so this cannot be routinely measured in clinical settings. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and rapid antigen tests can be performed in hours or minutes, compared to several days for determining infectious titer. Viral loads determined by qRT-PCR are, at best, a crude measure of actual infectious virus shedding, so further research is needed to establish viral loads in asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases (see the figure).

The biological basis for transmission without symptoms is poorly understood, even though it is common for respiratory viruses, including "common cold" pathogens such as rhinoviruses and other coronaviruses, to be spread by both contact and inhalation. Symptomless transmission is influenced by the timing and magnitude of the host response to infection, which is a major determinant of pathogenicity. Delayed or reduced host antiviral immune responses are closely linked to COVID-19 severity, suggesting a relationship between host response and symptom onset. This includes suppressed interferon-induced cytokine expression, which is linked to symptoms. As a gateway between the body and the environment, the upper respiratory tract is regularly exposed to external antigens. Thus, the nasal mucosa is a niche immune site in which antiviral responses are modulated by external factors (such as temperature or humidity) and host susceptibility (mucus, receptor distribution, and host response to infection) and may explain why symptomless spread is common for respiratory viruses.

With many contagious people experiencing no symptoms and in the absence of robust surveillance testing for asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic infections, it is critical to maximize efforts to reduce transmission risk in the community. Academic debates about the frequency of different transmission routes reframe exposure risk reduction as a dichotomy rather than a spectrum, confusing rather than informing guidance. Rather than targeting transmission by either inhalation or contact, infection prevention efforts should focus instead on the additive nature of risk reduction and the need for continued vigilance in community-based infection prevention measures, including masks, distancing, avoiding enclosed spaces, ventilation, hand hygiene, and disinfection.

Transmission without symptoms critically contributes to the unabated spread of SARS-CoV-2 and presents a considerable infection prevention challenge. Although asymptomatic individuals appear to be contagious for a shorter period of time and may pose a lower transmission risk, they still pose a substantial public health risk as they are more likely to be out in the community. It is unclear how vaccination will affect the number of asymptomatic cases, although preliminary data suggest that mass immunization will reduce infection overall, thus reducing transmission. For pre-symptomatic cases, research has shown that viral shedding is highest just before and for a few days after symptoms begin, which is a critical time to ensure that individuals who may not realize they have been exposed stay home when possible and practice risk reduction efforts when in the community. Until there is widespread implementation of robust surveillance and epidemiological measures that allow us to put out these smokeless fires, the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be fully extinguished.

[A] AstraZeneca: Vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia
Date: Mar 27 2021
Source: Science [abridged, edited]
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/03/rare-clotting-disorder-may-cloud-worlds-hopes-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine


In the tumultuous rollout of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, all eyes were on the United States this week, where the company had a highly public communication breakdown over the vaccine's efficacy with an expert panel overseeing a large study in the Americas. But on the other side of the Atlantic, the vaccine faces new concerns about safety as an explanation gains ground for the unusual strokes and clotting disorders recorded in at least 30 recipients.

Many European countries suspended use of AstraZeneca's vaccine earlier this month [March 2021] following initial reports of the symptoms, which have led to at least 15 deaths. Most resumed vaccinations after the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended doing so on 18 Mar 2021, saying the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks. EMA is continuing to investigate the matter and will convene a wide ranging committee of experts on 29 Mar 2021.

Now, a group of researchers led by German clotting specialist Andreas Greinacher of the University of Greifswald says the highly unusual combination of symptoms -- widespread blood clots and a low platelet count, sometimes with bleeding -- resembles a rare side effect of the blood thinner heparin, called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).

The scientists, who 1st described their findings during a 19 Mar 2021 press conference, recommend a way to test for and treat the disorder and say this can help ease worries about the vaccine. "We know what to do: how to diagnose it, and how to treat it," says Greinacher, who calls the syndrome vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia, or VIPIT.

Greinacher says he has submitted a manuscript to the preprint server Research Square [see DOI:10.21203/rs.3.rs-194846/v1.]

Even if Greinacher's mechanism isn't the whole story, multiple researchers told Science they were convinced that the vaccine was causing the rare set of symptoms. If that turns out to be true, it could have major consequences for the vaccine, which is one of the cornerstones of the World Health Organization's push to immunize the world. AstraZeneca is working with partners around the globe to make and distribute billions of doses in low- and middle-income countries, which might have a harder time identifying and treating rare side effects.

Europe is relying heavily on the vaccine as well; the European Union bought 400 million doses. The company's failure to deliver on time has delayed vaccine rollouts on the continent, but now, dented confidence is exacerbating the delays. And even if the risk is very low, it may make sense to use the vaccine only in those who also stand to gain the most from it: elderly people at high risk of dying from COVID-19. Several European countries have started to do this. The situation has scientists walking a tightrope: They want to make the medical profession aware of their concerns without sowing panic.

But Greinacher's hypothesis is being taken seriously. Two German medical societies put out press releases lauding him for solving the issue. In the Netherlands, the Dutch Internal Medicine Society urged internists to be aware of the symptoms and the recommended course of action. The United Kingdom has officially reported only 5 cases despite administering 11 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but the British Society of Haematology has urged its members to be aware of "an important and emerging area of haemostasis and thrombosis practice" and to report any possible cases. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has recommended against giving any COVID-19 vaccine to people with a history of HIT.

It is not yet clear how the vaccine could trigger VIPIT, and not everyone thinks the case is closed. "It's intriguing, but I am not entirely convinced," says Robert Brodsky, a hematologist at Johns Hopkins University. AstraZeneca, meanwhile, has not directly responded to the reports of the rare constellation of symptoms except to say that they did not appear in any of the company's clinical trials.

"People are absolutely working like crazy behind the scenes to provide more clarity," says Saskia Middeldorp, a vascular internist at Radboud University Medical Center in the Netherlands, who disagreed with the temporary halt of the vaccine because she says the benefits clearly outweigh the risks.

Key Message
This Science Brief provides information for health care professionals about Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT), a rare adverse event following the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine.

This brief describes the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnostic work-up and treatment of VIPIT. Figure 1 [Decision Tree for Diagnosing and Ruling Out VIPIT; see URL] presents a decision tree for diagnosing and ruling out VIPIT.

Could other COVID-19 vaccines available in Ontario cause VIPIT? There have been no confirmed cases of VIPIT with any other COVID-19 vaccine.

Full Text
Background
The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine appears to be associated with autoimmune thrombosis that mimics heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

The United Kingdom, European Union, and Scandinavian countries have reported rare cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT) and thrombocytopenia in patients who received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. The majority of affected patients thus far are women under the age of 55 years, and CSVT seems to occur 4 to 20 days after vaccination. The Paul Ehrlich Institute has demonstrated that affected individuals in Germany have antibodies that induce massive platelet activation, reducing the platelet count and causing thrombosis.1 This phenomenon mimics heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) yet it does not require heparin as a trigger. It has been named vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT).

How frequent is VIPIT?
To date, millions of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, with suspected cases of VIPIT occurring in only a small fraction of vaccinated individuals. However, there is growing evidence of a causal link with the vaccine. The incidence of VIPIT appears to be between one in 125 000 and one in one million.2

There is no evidence that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine increases the overall risk of thrombosis (e.g., deep vein thromboses, pulmonary emboli, myocardial infarction, stroke) beyond what is seen in the general population despite the observed increases in CSVT, as the risk of CSVT is orders of magnitude lower than the risk of other thromboses. The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective in preventing COVID-19, which also carries a high risk of thrombosis; one in 5 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 develops venous thrombosis.3 For this reason, Health Canada, the United Kingdom Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and the European Medicines Agency have recommended to continue administering the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine and have all made clear statements about their assessment of risks and benefits in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.2,4,5 Physicians, scientists, and regulatory agencies worldwide will continue to carefully monitor the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine and of COVISHIELD, the version of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine currently available in Canada.

Are certain patients predisposed to VIPIT?
At this time, it is not clear whether certain patients are predisposed to VIPIT. The cases to date are predominantly in younger women; however, these individuals may have been overrepresented in the vaccinated population in European Union countries.2 Further information from jurisdictions like the United Kingdom that prioritized older adults for early vaccination is pending. Since VIPIT is immune-mediated, an individual with a thrombophilia, a family history of blood clots, or a personal history of arterial or venous clots would likely not be at increased of VIPIT. Accordingly, there are no new contraindications to receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.

When should I suspect my patient has VIPIT?
Patients with VIPIT may present with CSVT, or with other arterial or venous clots. Any patient with unusual symptoms following vaccination should be assessed by a healthcare provider. Some symptoms make it more likely that a patient has VIPIT: persistent and severe headache; focal neurological symptoms (including blurred vision); shortness of breath; abdominal or chest pain; swelling and redness in a limb; or pallor and coldness in a limb. VIPIT seems to occur between 4 to 20 days post-vaccination. Symptoms in this time frame should raise the clinical suspicion of VIPIT.

How do I diagnose VIPIT? How do I rule it out?
Patients with severe symptoms should urgently seek care at their nearest emergency department. Patients with non-severe symptoms may have initial investigations done in the primary care or outpatient setting.

Clinicians should ask patients about their COVID-19 vaccine history and should draw a complete blood count (CBC). VIPIT is unlikely if symptoms of blood clotting fall outside of the 4-20 day time frame or if the platelet count is 150 x 109/L.6 VIPIT is more likely if symptoms of blood clotting fall within the 4-20 day time frame and the platelet count is under 150 x 109/L, and such patients should be evaluated at their nearest emergency department for suspected VIPIT. This will expedite further diagnostic workup, treatment, and urgent hematology consultation.

Patients with suspected VIPIT should go on to have blood work drawn including a D-dimer level and a blood film. When there is strong clinical suspicion of VIPIT, patients should also have diagnostic imaging to investigate for blood clots (including appropriate imaging to rule out CSVT, if the patient presents with a persistent and severe headache). It is not known whether VIPIT, like HIT, is associated with arterial thromboses, but arterial clots should be considered if patients have consistent symptoms. An elevated D-dimer, a normal blood film (apart from thrombocytopenia), and confirmation of a blood clot on diagnostic imaging makes the diagnosis of VIPIT presumptive.

The confirmatory diagnosis of VIPIT is made by testing for HIT. This testing should be done even if the patient has had no previous exposure to heparin. HIT testing involves 2 steps: identification of antibodies against the complex of platelet factor 4 and heparin; and confirmatory functional testing of the antibodies' ability to activate platelets.7 The HIT antibody test appears very sensitive to VIPIT; if it is positive, VIPIT is confirmed, and if it is negative, VIPIT is unlikely.1

A number of large hospital laboratories test for HIT antibodies, but only one lab in Canada performs confirmatory functional testing (the McMaster University Platelet Immunology Laboratory). Therefore, presumptive VIPIT should prompt an urgent hematology consultation (in person, virtually, or by phone) to arrange testing and start safe empiric treatment of blood clots (see below).

How do I treat VIPIT?
Patients with presumptive and confirmed VIPIT should be treated similarly to HIT. The Box presents the treatment principles for patients with presumptive and confirmed VIPIT. Until VIPIT has been ruled out, anticoagulation with heparin (unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins) should be avoided. Platelet transfusions should not be given.

Alternative anticoagulants that are safe to use in HIT, and likely safe to use in VIPIT, include direct thrombin inhibitors and anti-Xa inhibitors. Most clinicians in Ontario will be comfortable using direct oral anti-Xa inhibitors (e.g., rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban) empirically while awaiting further advice from a hematologist; these agents are used in the treatment of HIT. The dose of direct oral anti-Xa inhibitor is identical to the dose used to treat uncomplicated deep vein thromboses. If the patient has severe renal impairment that makes direct oral anticoagulants unsafe, advice from a hematologist should be sought to guide use of parenteral anticoagulants that are safe to use in HIT.

How do I treat VIPIT with life threatening blood clots?
In patients with confirmed VIPIT and severe or life-threatening blood clots (e.g., CSVT, splanchnic vein thrombosis), it is important to dampen the prothrombotic response with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Administration of high dose IVIG (1 g/kg of body weight daily for 2 days) is appropriate and can be guided by the consulting hematologist.

Interpretation
VIPIT is a rare adverse event following the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. This brief describes the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnostic work-up and treatment of VIPIT, including a decision tree for diagnosing and ruling out VIPIT.
