Recurrent outbreaks of cholera in the western province of Nyanza are
caused by widespread water contamination, including seepage from
latrines, health officials said. "The major contributor to the recent
outbreaks in the area was unsafe water," Shahnaaz Sharif, the senior
deputy director of medical services in Kenya's health ministry, said.
"In Kisumu, many wells are built near the latrine; eventually the
sewage seeps into the wells."

The high water table in the area was a contributing factor, Sharif
said. Tests done on water samples from Kisumu and Nyando, 2 of the
most affected districts in the province, indicated that 75 percent of
sources were contaminated.

"People need to be made aware of water safety, by fetching their
water from a safe source and boiling it," Moses Atuko, the emergency
health manager at the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) said. At least
80 percent of cholera transmissions are attributed to a lack of
access to safe water.

The KRCS, in partnership with the Ministry of Health and other NGOs
(non-governmental organizations), was sensitizing people in the
affected areas to the importance of good sanitation and discouraging
practices such as bathing and washing clothes in the rivers.
According to Atuko, this "was a tall order," since many people in the
region used Lake Victoria and the rivers as their main sources of
water. However, he added, the number of cholera cases had fallen.
"Last week, we only reported 4 cases; 4 weeks ago, there were more
than 100 cases," he said.

Guinea-Bissau has reported an increase in cholera cases in July 2008
to more than 600 and the infection rate has been spread countrywide
to areas that were previously considered to be at low risk, experts
say.

Silvia Luciani, United Nations Children Emergency Fund (UNICEF)
representative in Guinea-Bissau says "we have seen a notable increase
in cases in the last week and it is all over the country." According
to Government figures so far some 611 people have contracted the
disease in 2008 of which 344 were infected in July 2008; 14 of them
have died.

According to the UN Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN)
the outbreak has reached Gabu and Bafata, 2 areas considered immune
from the infection, and 6 other regions. Simao Mendes, the national
hospital in Bissau, has reported 88 cholera cases in just 3 days,
from 18 to 20 Jul 2008.

[The following is from the commentary on a report on cholera from
ProMED-mail Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (ProMED-MBDS) [Cholera
- Viet Nam (21) 20080729.2312]:

"To date [29 Jul 2008], the total number of cases reported in Viet
Nam since the beginning of this year (2008) has been 4143 acute
diarrhea cases and 649 cholera cases. However, no fatalities
associated with these outbreaks have been detected. The most recent
outbreak of acute diarrhea was reported from Tan Viet commune, Thanh
Ha district of Hai Duong province, where 3 cases of cholera were
detected (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Cholera - Viet Nam (20): Hai
Duong 20080728.2302).

It's also important to mention the recent identification of _Vibrio
cholera_ contamination of frozen fish filets imported to Norway from
Viet Nam (see PRO/MBDS Food poisoning, fish filets - Norway ex Viet
Nam: RFI 20080727.2295). Fortunately there have been no reported
cases of cholera associated with these contaminated fish filets as
yet (there was also contamination with staphylococcal toxin, which
did result in a single reported case of food poisoning in Norway
which led to the testing of the fish filets). - Mods.YMA/MPP"

Panchkula is in Haryana, a state in North India. It was carved out of
the state of Punjab in 1966. Haryana surrounds Delhi on 3 sides,
forming the northern, western, and southern borders of Delhi.
Consequently, a large area of Haryana is included in the National
Capital Region. The capital of Haryana is Chandigarh, which is
administered as a union territory and is also the capital of Punjab.

At least 172 villagers have died in a cholera outbreak that has
triggered unrest in Indonesia's remote eastern Papua province, church
authorities said Tuesday [29 Jul 2008]. Church aid workers in the
Kamuu valley [West Papua] confirmed the victims had died from severe
diarrhea and vomiting caused by cholera, said Catholic brother Budi
Hermawan from the Jayapura archdiocese.

The source of the outbreak, which began in April 2008, was still
unknown, but the disease appeared to be spreading via drinking water
from a river and products in markets in the highland region, Hermawan
told AFP by phone from Jayapura.
