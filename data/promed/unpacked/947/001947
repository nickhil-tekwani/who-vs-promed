A wood pigeon was discovered dead in the town of Genêts on 7 Feb 2022. After examinations, the Prefecture of Manche confirmed that the pigeon had died of avian influenza. This is the 2nd case in the same region within a week. The previous case involved a common shelduck found dead on the nearby beach of Saint-Jean-le Thomas on 1 Feb 2022.

Following the detection of avian influenza in these 2 wild birds, the temporary control zone in Manche has been extended, implying restrictive measures and strict health instructions.

In Normandy, this is the 5th case of avian influenza listed, after the 3 outbreaks identified in the communes in Seine-Maritime.

This 4th episode of avian influenza in France mainly affects the South West of the country, where many farms have been affected since the end of November 2021.

According to a census of the Ministry of Agriculture, France had, as of 1 Feb 2022, 328 outbreaks in farms, including 218 in Landes, in the heart of the foie gras country, where mass slaughters were organized. Nearly 3 million poultry, including 1.9 million waterfowl, have been slaughtered to eradicate avian influenza since the 1st cases were detected.

The previous epizootic, last winter [2020-21], resulted in the slaughter of more than 3.5 million poultry, mainly ducks.

[The media report above does not specify the full identity of the virus detected in the 2 recent wild birds; assumed, it is HPAI H5N1; confirmation expected.

According to the data of France's Ministry of Agriculture, the 1st outbreak of HPAI H5N1 was detected on 26 Nov 2021 in a commercial laying hen farm in the commune of Warhem, in the Nord department. This was the 1st case on farms since last winter's epizootic which lasted until spring 2021 (caused by H5N8). On 16 Dec 2021, an H5N1 type outbreak was confirmed in a farm of ducks ready to force-feed in the town of Manciet, in the Gers. This was the 1st poultry outbreak highlighted in the Southwest since the start of this new episode. Several other farms have since been affected and new cases have been detected in wildlife. As of 14 Feb 2022, France has had 354 outbreaks of HPAI in livestock, 33 cases in wildlife, and 15 cases in backyards (https://agriculture.gouv.fr/influenza-aviaire-la-situation-en-france).

The continuing, major HPAI outbreak, involving mainly H5N1, has spread, since its start in Oct 2021, within 4 continents -- Asia, Europe, Africa, and, most recently, North America. The most affected continent is Europe.

Numbers of AI events, involving poultry, captive birds, and wild birds, reported from 31 European countries since the start of the epizootic and as of 10 Feb 2022 (from the 40th week of 2021 -- week of 4 Oct 2021 -- to the 6th week of 2022 -- week of 7 Feb 2022), are available at https://www.izsvenezie.com/documents/reference-laboratories/avian-influenza/europe-updates/HPAI/2021-1/total-events.pdf. They include a total of 902 outbreaks on poultry farms, led by Italy (308), France (301), and Hungary (113). The total number of infected wild birds was 1606, of which 869 were in Germany, followed by the Netherlands (284) and Denmark (89). The same website of IZS Venezia presents a graphic with weekly data; the epizootic peaked during the 2nd week of 2022, after which a distinct weekly decrease is apparent in Europe.

A cumulative global list of bird species reportedly infected by avian influenza virus (AVI) since 2005, is available at https://www.fao.org/ag/AGAInfo/programmes/en/empres/Global_AIV_Zoonotic_Update/table_species_H5N8_HPAI.html. The list includes 5 groups:

1. Domestic bird species affected.
2. Farmed wildlife species affected (Private collections, displays, or production).
3. Wild birds involved in transmission.
4. Wild birds known as accidental hosts.
5. Scavenger wild birds and birds of prey.

The bird species newly affected by H5Nx HPAI since February 2019 are listed in red.

A map, presenting the global distribution of AIV with zoonotic potential observed since 1 Oct 2021 (that is, the current wave) as of 26 Jan 2022, is available at https://www.fao.org/ag/AGAInfo/programmes/en/empres/Global_AIV_Zoonotic_Update/situation_update.html.

During the recent major epizootic, recorded human infections have been exceptional. - Mod.AS
