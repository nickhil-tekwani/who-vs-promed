AVIAN POX, ALBATROSS - NEW ZEALAND: REQUEST FOR INFO
====================================================
Date: Sun, 09 Mar 1997 01:54:05 -0900
From: afdcd1@UAA.ALASKA.EDU (Dr. David Duffy)
URGENT REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.
During the current breeding season the populations of Northern Royal
albatross
(_Diomedea sanfordi_) have been suffering slightly more than their usual
collection of troubles. This is a very small population of albatrosses
nesting
on the New Zealand mainland.
At the Taiaroa Head colony most of the current Royal albatross chicks
and many of their parents have recently been inflicted with an outbreak of
an
avian pox virus which produces small pustules on the bill and round the
eyes
and while unsightly does not at this stage seem to be fatal. At least 2 of
the management staff have subsequently been infected with a similar looking
pox on the hands. This has not been seem in the population before.
I would be interested in hearing of any similar events which have occurred
in
Procellariformes before, and an indication of any causes or effects which
have
been seen in other species.
