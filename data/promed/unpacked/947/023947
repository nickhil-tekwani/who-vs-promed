Ukraine: Adult and Children Bitten by Rabid Fox in Kharkov Region
---------------------------------------------------
The following case of rabies in a human in the Kharkov region of Ukraine
has been reported by the press-service of Ministry of Health of Ukraine. On
27 Jan 2005 a 34-year-old man was admitted to Lozovskaya Central Regional
Hospital (Kharkov region) suffering from breathing difficulties and a
general deterioration in health.
The patient attributed his indisposition to injuries he had received on the
previous evening. He was hospitalised in the trauma unit with a diagnosis
of "acute craniocereberal trauma and injury to his throat." On 28 Jan 2005
he exhibited symptoms of hydrophobia. During medical examination, the
patient admitted that approximately 2 months ago in the Shulskoe settlement
of Pervomaisky in the Kharkov region, he had been bitten by a fox. He did
not seek medical assistance at the time.
On the basis of the clinical data the patient was diagnosed as a rabies
case and admitted to the Kharkov Regional Clinical Hospital.
On 28-29 Jan 2005 doctors and epidemiologists, together with
representatives of the state veterinary service, carried out an
epizootic-epidemiological investigation to assess the likelihood of rabies.
During the investigation it was revealed that 10 other individuals,
including 6 children, were in contact with and petted the sick animal.
Post-exposure rabies therapy was initiated immediately. None of the victims
had sought medical attention prior to the investigation. No cases of
disease in domestic pets were discovered. Anti-epidemic therapies were
implemented immediately.
