New Hope for Treatment of Killer Disease Kala-Azar
--------------------------------------------------
A new treatment has recently been developed for leishmaniasis, also
known as [kala-azar &] black fever, a disease that each year afflicts
some 500 000 people globally and kills at least 60 000. The United
Nations' World Health Organisation (WHO) said in a statement this
week that scientists had developed a new treatment found to be at least
95 percent effective in [clinical trials in] patients who developed the
more lethal "visceral" form of leishmaniasis.
[see: <http://www.who.int/inf/en/pr-2002-46.html>]
The new drug, Miltefosine, the first oral drug developed against
leishmaniasis, has already been approved for use in India, which has
half the global burden of the disease. Miltefosine was developed
[through a cooperative effort] by the Indian government, the German
biopharmaceutical company Zentaris, the [WHO] Tropical Diseases
Research program, the United Nations Development Programme and
the World Bank.
WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland noted "We now have a
powerful new tool to fight this terrible disease. The combined efforts
of these partners have opened a new era in the fight against visceral
leishmaniasis."
Considered one of the world's most neglected diseases, leishmaniasis --
a parasitic "wasting" disease transmitted through the bite of a sandfly --
afflicts some of the world's poorest people, with 80 percent of its
victims earning less than US $2 a day. Until now, all treatments for
leishmaniasis had had substantial drawbacks, ranging from high cost to
high toxicity, and even causing irreversible damage such as diabetes,
the WHO stated this week. The current treatment for one patient
(Pentostam, antimony, amphotericin B or pentamidine) is prohibitive
for most Sudanese sufferers from leishmaniasis; it can cost as much as
250 000 Sudanese pounds (about $97), about 8 times the average
monthly wage of a Sudanese government employee, according to US-
based Program for Monitoring Emerging
Diseases (ProMED-mail).
The disease is found in parts of 88 countries, but about 90 percent of
all black fever cases occur in 5 countries: India, Brazil, Sudan, Nepal,
& Bangladesh. In the 1990s, Sudan suffered a crisis with 100 000
deaths among people at risk, according to the WHO. WHO cited studies
indicating that in some villages up to half the population succumbed to
the disease, and said one report suggested that during this decade,
visceral leishmaniasis claimed 100 000 lives in a population of around
300 000 in western Upper Nile province.
[see: <http://www.who.int/emc/diseases/leish/index.html>]
In Sudan, where the visceral form is known as kala-azar, leishmaniasis
is most common in the conflict-affected Blue Nile, Upper Nile, Jonglei,
and Kassala regions, as well as in the area north of the capital,
Khartoum. There are also indications that the disease is present in the
Nuba Mountains region of Southern Kordofan State, south-central
Sudan, according to humanitarian sources. Increasing disease activity
has also been noted in the eastern state of Al-Qadarif, notably along the
Rahad and Dinder Rivers, while activity -- formerly prevalent -- has
been decreasing in Sinnar and Sinjah, according to ProMED-mail. The
international medical organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres
complained in February 2002 that systematic looting of the village of
Nimne in oil-rich western Upper Nile had disrupted a kala-azar project
with 107 patients under treatment and a basic health care unit with 1700-
2000 consultations per month.
Over 40 000 fatal cases were reported from the western Upper Nile
between 1984 and 1991, and the death toll among the Nuer and Dinka
peoples in southern Sudan was estimated at 200 000 between 1988 and
1995, ProMED-mail added.

[Miltefosine (hexadecylphosphocholine) belongs to the drug family of
alkyl-lysophospholipids (ALP), which has broad antiparasitic and anti-
tumor activities. Leishmaniasis disease is often related to environmental
changes such as deforestation, building of dams, new irrigation
schemes, urbanisation, and migration of non-immune people to
endemic areas, according to the WHO.

The incidence of the disease is also severely underestimated, so that the
actual health loss associated with it is greater than official figures
suggest. - Mod.EP]
