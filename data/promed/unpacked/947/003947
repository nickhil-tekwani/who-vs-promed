Your message on the dying apes and pigs in Ethiopia has
been passed to me. I have two comments for you.
First, there are no apes of any kind in Ethiopia (as you
are probably aware). Given the location of the site (Bale
province), the only species these could have been are
baboons (olive baboons, (_Papio anubis_) or vervet monkeys
(_Cercoipithecus aethiops_). It's just possible that they
could be gelada (_Theropithecus gelada_), but so far as we
know, the only gelada population south of the Rift valley
is further to the north (in the Arussi mountains) and
rather small numerically. Neither baboons nor (especially)
vervets go round in groups of 1000s (nor do gelada for that
matter, though groups of 400-500 do occur in the Simen area
far to the north).
Second, there has been a recent report of a somewhat
similar incident in baboons in South Africa. You can check
the report in the following:
Barrett, L. & Henzi, S.P. (1998). Epidemic deaths in a chacma baboon
population. S.Afr. J. Sci. 94: 441.
They are not absolutely sure what or how the epidemic
occurred, but the short answer is that about 50% of the
animals in two troops died very rapidly (within days) after
some kind of infection (it was being checked out by
pathologists if they dont state what it is in the paper)
that was almost certainly picked up from a flooded sewage
system of the local human "village". The infection
involved similar signs (dysentery, hemorrhagic fever, death
within hours of first symptoms) as reported in the
Ethiopian case. It also ended very rapidly; only two
troops became infected (the second as a result of a male
transferring from the first troop to fall ill with it) and
none of the other troops in the nature reserve showed any
signs of it.
