Recent outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in Thailand were caused by 2
strains of the virus, but neither of them showed any significant
mutation that would enable them to jump easily to people or spread
with ease among humans.
Yong Poovorawan, a professor at Chulalongkorn University's Medical
Faculty in Thailand, analysed 2 H5N1 samples taken from infected
chickens in Thailand's central Pichit province and one taken from
northeastern Nakhon Phanom province last month. The 2 samples from
Pichit closely resembled a H5N1 strain that had circulated in
Thailand in 2004 and 2005, his laboratory found. But the one from
Nakhon Phanom was a new strain that had never been seen in Thailand
and was most closely related to a strain that had been circulating
since 2005 in southern China.
Genetic analyses showed all three samples had undergone slight
mutations -- which are typical of influenza A viruses that have
circulated for some time -- but the changes did not make them any
more dangerous to people, Poovorawan said. "There was no change in
their receptor binding sites and there was no change in their
resistance to (anti-viral) Tamiflu," he said, referring to 2 key
traits of H5N1. Scientists look at these traits when determining if
there may be changes in H5N1 that would enable it to jump more easily
to people and spread easily among them.
It is still difficult for humans to catch bird flu because it has
"receptor binding sites", which prefer to lock on to receptors in
bird hosts, not humans. Some experts believe it is when the H5N1's
receptor binding site adapts to human hosts that it will transmit
easily among people, and spark a pandemic that could kill millions.
Poovorawan said the genetic sequence of the H5N1 sample from Nakhon
Phanom showed it was most closely related to a strain that has been
circulating in China's eastern provinces of Zhejiang (2006) and Anhui
(2005), Fujian (2005) in the southeast, and southwestern Guangxi
(2005). "There are many ways to spread a virus from one place to
another. Poultry, people, migratory birds," he said, but declined to
speculate how the strain was introduced into Thailand.
The U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said on Thursday
[17 Aug 2006] that the strain in Nakhon Phanom and neighbouring Laos
appeared to have come from southern China and it called for stricter
measures to prevent further spread of the disease in birds and
poultry. "Poultry trade across borders is continuing in Southeast and
East Asia despite well-known risks," FAO stated.
On the Pichit strain, the FAO said it had "remained alive [active?]
(in the past 2-3 years) in central Thailand in a reservoir of birds
and poultry, most probably a mixture of backyard chickens, ducks and
fighting cocks". A 17-year-old youth died in the outbreak.
The virus has spread to Europe, the Middle East and Africa and is
known to have killed 139 people, according to the World Health
Organisation. Indonesian officials also reported the death of a
9-year-old girl from the disease in West Java this week.

[This report provides further limited information concerning the
properties of the 2 strains of H5N1 avian influenza virus now
circulating in Thailand and Laos. The conclusion that these variants
present no additional hazard for the human population is based on
absence of mutational changes affecting the receptor binding site
which might alter the host tissue specificity of the virus.
The following WHO document provides a comprehensive overview of the
extent of genetic variation of strains of H5N1 avian influenza and
the antigenic variability of H5N1 viruses. This document should be
consulted in any discussion of H5N1 virus strain characteristics. - Mod.CP]

Antigenic and genetic characteristics of H5N1 viruses and candidate
H5N1 vaccine viruses developed for potential use as pre-pandemic vaccines
---------------------------------------------------
This WHO document describes the current status of the development of
new candidate H5N1 vaccine viruses and is intended to provide
guidance for national authorities and vaccine companies on the
selection of candidate viruses for use in vaccine development. The
selection of H5N1 vaccine viruses should consider the geographical
spread, epidemiology, and antigenic and genetic properties of
recently circulating H5N1 viruses.
(1) H5N1 vaccine viruses developed for potential use as pre-pandemic vaccines
---------------------------------------------------
The development of representative pre-pandemic H5N1 candidate vaccine
viruses by the WHO Global Influenza Programme (1) is being conducted
as one step in an overall strategy for pandemic preparedness. This
summary presents the current status of the development of new
candidate H5N1 vaccine viruses and is intended to provide guidance
for national authorities on the production of pre-pandemic vaccine.
The H5N1 viruses chosen for development of pre-pandemic candidate
vaccine viruses are representative of antigenically and genetically
distinct groups of viruses that have infected humans primarily
through contact with ill or dead H5N1-infected birds. These
representative candidate H5N1 vaccine viruses have been prepared by
reverse genetics and safety tested prior to release for production of
pilot vaccine lots that may be used for experimental studies and for
stockpiling by governments in advance of a possible H5N1 pandemic,
should such a national policy exist. Companies are recommended to
consult individual national authorities on the H5N1 strains to be
used. Decisions should be based on the epidemiology of the
circulating H5N1 viruses that are described below.
Comparison of the previously developed (clade 1 rg
A/Vietnam/1194/2004 and rg A/Vietnam 1203/2004)(2) and new candidate
H5N1 vaccine viruses and studies of cross-reactivity of these
pre-pandemic vaccine viruses and their relationship to newly emerging
H5N1 viruses are ongoing, and will be reported periodically by WHO.
(2) Genetic characteristics of recent H5N1 viruses
----------------------------------------------
The haemagglutinin (HA) sequences of the majority of H5N1 viruses
circulating in avian species during the past 3 years separated into 2
distinct phylogenetic clades (genetic groups)(3).3 Clade 1 viruses
circulating in Cambodia, Thailand and Viet Nam were responsible for
human infections in those countries during 2004 and 2005. Clade 2
viruses circulated in birds in China and Indonesia during 2003-2004
and subsequently during 2005-2006 spread westwards to the Middle
East, Europe and Africa. This latter genetic group of viruses has
been principally responsible for human infections during the later
part of 2005 and 2006. Six sub-clades of clade 2 have been
distinguished, 3 of which (subclades 1, 2 and 3) also differ in
geographical distribution and have been largely responsible for human
cases in Indonesia, in countries in the Middle East, Europe and
Africa, and in China, respectively. Figure 1 in the original document
is a phylogenetic tree showing the relationships of some 60 strains
comprising the 2 major clades and the 3 sub-clades.
(3) Antigenic characteristics of recent H5N1 viruses
----------------------------------------------------
The antigenic relationships between the HAs of human isolates
representative of clade 1 and 3 subclades of clade 2 were compared by
haemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests using post-infection ferret
antisera. Reciprocal cross-reactions in HI tests demonstrated
antigenic similarity of HAs within the same genetic clade and
distinguished representatives of different clades with the exception
of viruses from the Karo cluster (4) represented by
A/Indonesia/CDC625/2006. Viruses from this family cluster were
antigenically distinguishable from the majority of human isolates
represented by A/Indonesia/5/2005 and A/Indonesia/CDC357/2006
(subclade 1), and appeared antigenically more closely related to H5N1
viruses in subclade 2.
[In the original document These data for 14 strains representing the
2 major and 3 sub-clades are compiled in the form of a table,
illustrating striking differences in haemagglutination inhibition titres]
(4) New candidate vaccine viruses
-----------------------------
Viruses representative of subclade 1 (A/Indonesia/5/2005) and
subclade 2 (A/Bar headed goose/Qinghai/1A/2005, A/Whooper
swan/Mongolia/244/2005 and A/turkey/Turkey/1/2005) were selected (5)
for the preparation of reverse genetics modified reassortant vaccine
viruses using the laboratory reference strain A/PR8/34 as donor of
the polymerase, nucleoprotein, matrix and non-structural protein
genes. HI analysis confirmed that the reassortant candidate vaccine
viruses were antigenically similar to the parent viruses and the
majority of recent isolates within the same clade. On the basis of
more recent data, a subclade 3 vaccine virus is also being prepared
from A/Anhui/1/2005.
(5) Recommended use of candidate pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine viruses
---------------------------------------------------
Pre-pandemic vaccines have been produced by manufacturers using clade
1 viruses (rg A/Vietnam/1194/2004 (NIBRG-14) and rg
A/Vietman/1203/2004 (CDCRG-1 and SJRG-161052). Clinical trials have
been conducted or are under way in several countries and stockpiling
of clade 1 vaccines has begun in some countries. Because it is not
known if the next influenza pandemic will be caused by H5N1 viruses
or which of the clades or subclades of H5N1 would be responsible,
should one occur, clinical trials using clade 1 viruses should
continue as an essential element in pandemic preparedness to maximize
data available on priming, cross-reactivity and cross-protection by
vaccine viruses from different clades and subclades.
On the basis of the geographical spread, the epidemiology, and the
antigenic and genetic properties of the H5N1 viruses isolated from
humans during the past 12 months, national authorities may recommend
the use of one or more of the following H5N1 candidate vaccine
viruses for pilot lot vaccine production and subsequent stockpiling
of vaccines, should relevant national policies exist: An
A/Indonesia/5/2005-like virus An A/Bar headed
goose/Qinghai/1A/2005-like virus (6) An A/Anhui/1/2005-like virus (7).
