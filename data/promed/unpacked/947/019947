Situation summary of cholera in the Americas
--------------------------------------------
In Cuba, the International Health Regulations National Focal Point (IHR NFP) reported that 23 additional confirmed cholera cases were registered through the investigation of suspected cases between epidemiological week (EW) 35 of 2013 and EW 8 of 2014. In total, 701 cholera cases, including 3 deaths, have been registered since the beginning of the outbreak in EW 27 of 2012 through EW 8 of 2014.

The national authorities continue to investigate suspected cholera cases detected through their clinical-epidemiological surveillance system. Public awareness campaigns on hygienic measures, especially those related to hand washing, water chlorination and cleaning and proper handling and cooking of food have been intensified.

In the Dominican Republic, since the beginning of the epidemic (November 2010) through EW 8 of 2014, there have been a total of 31 532 suspected cholera cases, including 467 deaths. Between EW 1 and EW 8 of 2014, there have been 57 suspected cholera cases and no deaths, signifying a monthly average of 28 cases. This is less than the number of new cases registered in the same period of 2013 (monthly average of 112 cases and 2 deaths), in 2012 (563 cases and 4 deaths, monthly average), and in 2011 (934 cases and 16 deaths, monthly average). Thus far in 2014, a decreasing trend in cases has been recorded; only 3 provinces, Maria Trinidad Sanchez, Santo Domingo, and San Pedro de Macoris have recorded cases in the past 3 weeks.

In Haiti, since the beginning of the epidemic (October 2010) until 10 Mar 2014, there have been 700 541 cholera cases, of which 391 751 were hospitalized (55.9 percent) and 8546 died. The cumulative case-fatality rate remains 1.2 percent, with variations ranging from 4.4 percent in the department of Sud Est to 0.6 percent in Port-au-Prince. Between 1 Jan 2014 and 10 Mar 2014, 3850 cholera cases had been recorded, including 18 deaths (the cumulative case-fatality-rate for 2014 is 0.5 percent), signifying a weekly average of 385 cases and 2 deaths. This is lower than what was registered in 2013 (weekly average of 1106 cases and 9 deaths), in 2012 (4429 cases and 77 deaths weekly average), and in 2011 (29167 cases and 243 deaths weekly average). Thus far in 2014, a decreasing trend in cases and deaths has been recorded, even with all departments continuing to record new cases.

In Mexico, no new cases have been reported since 15 Nov 2013.
