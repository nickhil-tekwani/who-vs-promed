Mexico: national alert declared in response to outbreak of measles
-------------------------------------------
Mexican health authorities have declared a state of national alert due to
an outbreak of 59 cases of measles in the central part of the country. They
have also announced a vaccination campaign in the whole territory aimed at
preventing the propagation of the disease.
Miguel Angel Nakamura, technical director of the National Center for Child
and Adolescent Health, commented on Tue 27 Apr 2004 that the transmission
of measles in Mexico had already been eliminated and that the detection of
even one case is cause for alert. Since 2 Jan 2004, 59 cases of the disease
have been reported, the highest number since 2000, when an outbreak caused
by a virus that originated in Asia was reported. Of the cases registered to
date, 39 have occurred in the capital, 17 in the neighboring state of
Mexico, and 3 in the state of Hidalgo. Nakamura indicated that the cases
have been associated with a virus imported from Asia and that, although
there is no absolute certainty, it is believed that it might have been
brought into the country by one of the members of the Korean community in
the capital whose main activity is commerce.
Nakamura also explained that the 1st action taken to manage the outbreak
was the vaccination of all susceptible individuals residing in the areas
where the cases were detected. The 2nd stage will be vaccinating all
Mexicans between the ages of 13 and 39, considered to be the most
vulnerable group. Nakamura commented that in Mexico there are currently
more than 7 million doses of the vaccine available and that it is expected
that more will be purchased, to reach 16 million doses. Throughout the
country, 2.5 million doses of the vaccine have already been distributed.
Nakamura explained that the last [indigenous] case of measles in Mexico was
reported in 1996. 4 years later, in 2000, 30 cases of the disease, imported
from Asia, were reported. During 2001, 3 cases were registered, none during
2002, and 44 during 2003. The health authorities are urging all those who
are sure they have not had measles to get vaccinated.

In response to 59 cases of measles reported in Mexico between Jan and the
present [27 Apr 2004], the secretary of health informed the population that
they have taken measures in order to interrupt the chain of transmission of
the virus, implementing control measures such as the application of 16
million doses of vaccine in May and June [2004] to people between the ages
of 13 and 39 years, those most susceptible for the disease [see explanation
below, under "young adults" - Mod. MPP].
In 2004 there were 59 cases of measles reported in Mexico from 3 locations:
40 in the Federal District [Mexico City], 16 in the State of Mexico, and 3
in Hidalgo. Most of the cases (85 per cent) were in individuals greater
than 15 years of age; the remainder were in children under 1 year of age.
The vaccination schedule in Mexico recommends beginning with a first dose
of measles vaccine after the first birthday with a second dose at 6 years
of age. In all of the cases the H1 virus (from Korea) was isolated.
As of today, there has been work in 43 municipalities and delegations,
visiting 144 000 houses, interviewing about 112 000 families and reviewing
more than 1 100 000 diagnoses made in medical facilities. 16 million doses
of vaccine have been acquired and the government has began a large,
national vaccination campaign in the population.
Cases in young adults
Cases have occurred in young adults because this is the susceptible
population. The children between 1 and 9 years of age have been totally
protected with the 2 dose vaccination series. The young adults are more
susceptible because they did not receive a second dose of measles vaccine,
because the 2 dose policy did not exist [when they were younger] as it was
first introduced internationally in 1990.
Background of measles in Mexico
Year: cases / deaths
1989: 20 389 / 2251
1990: 68 782 / 5889
1991: 50 077 / 97

1996: 2 / 0
1997: 0 / 0
1998: 0 / 0
1999: 0 / 0
In 1999, autochthonous transmission was interrupted after 3 consecutive
years without virus transmission.

[Since 1994, rapid progress has been made in the elimination of measles
from the Americas. The number of measles cases has declined >99 per cent,
from about 250 000 in 1990 to 105 confirmed cases reported in 6 countries
in 2003. During 2003, only Mexico and the United States reported outbreaks.
The 3 chains of transmission in Mexico and 2 US outbreaks were
import-related; a 3rd US outbreak was of unknown source. Since November
2002, no transmission of the D6 and D9 genotypes has been reported; these
genotypes were responsible for several large outbreaks in the region during
the period 1997-2002. A recent CDC report summarized the epidemiology of
measles in the Americas during the period 2002-2003 and highlights progress
toward measles elimination, including the lowest-ever number of reported
measles cases in the region {see: MMWR 2004: 53(14): 304-6, 16 Apr
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/PDF/wk/mm5314.pdf>).
Because the region is under constant threat of measles importation from
regions where the disease is endemic, countries will have to maintain high
population immunity to measles and sensitive surveillance to ensure the
timely detection of imported cases and allow for rapid implementation of
control measures. - Mod.CP]
