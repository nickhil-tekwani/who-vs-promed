Re: Foot & mouth disease, antelope - Russia: (ZB) susp, RFI
-----------------------------------------------------------
[In response to ProMED-mail's request for information on the
background to mass mortality in antelopes entering Zabaykalsk (Russia)
from Mongolia and suspected -- so far, without evidence -- to be
infected by FMD, we have received the following information from Dr
Nigel Brown in Ulaanbaatar, for which we are very grateful. - Mod.AS]

I spoke to several people here [Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia], including in
the State Central Vet Laboratory (SCVL), the Transboundary Animal
Diseases Diagnostic Department and the Ministry (MoFALI) who made a
field trip out to the northeast of Mongolia and elsewhere in the
country.

They have no knowledge of any FMD infection and no evidence of this
disease in any of the wildlife or domestic stock examined. There are
also no reports of suspicious disease elsewhere in the country.

However, there are large numbers of dead animals in the country (the
official figure is 1.84 million livestock dead in January 2010)
[during the current] Dzud [a period of extreme weather], which [are
due to] a combination of severe weather, poor nutrition and lack of
housing or protection from prevailing weather [See item 2.]. Carcasses
are frozen solid (as you would expect at minus 42 C).

A national emergency has been declared with requests for assistance,
but the problems of transportation and distribution limit the
effectiveness of such attempts. Winter will continue until about April
(colder than average temperatures and more snow are predicted by
meteorologists), which suggests severe mortality will continue given
the absence of adequate feed stores.

[There has been] significant overstocking in recent years (livestock
population was estimated at about 47.1 million in autumn 2009), and
many suggest the carrying capacity is only 20-25 million. The body
condition of many animals going into winter was so poor that high
mortality was to be expected, and many more deaths will occur in
coming months.

An interesting area for study would seem to be the effect on
immunoglobulins in such extreme catabolic states and the likely impact
on resistance to spring time problems, notably clostridial
enterotoxaemia, parasitic disease and brucellosis.

I would be extremely grateful to any colleague who has any information
in this area. There is also extensive scope for assistance from
organisations able to assist with allowing Mongolian colleagues access
to training, including laboratory facilities, epidemiology and meat
hygiene.

A spell of intense cold, with temperatures plummeting to minus 40-50 C
followed a very dry and long summer and autumn 2009, which produced
insufficient fodder to feed livestock during the winter months. Such
extreme weather is known locally as a Dzud.

The ongoing Dzud has resulted in huge livestock losses, with 1.7
million deaths counted as of 31 Jan 2010. If current conditions
persist, the government estimates that losses could reach 3-4 million
head of livestock by spring 2010.

1/3rd of the population of Mongolia lead nomadic lives and depend
entirely on livestock for a living. Their cattle, sheep, goats, horses
and camels are the main household asset and are perishing from cold,
exhaustion or starvation. Total economic losses so far are estimated
at USD 62 million. Also, substantial numbers of wildlife are dying.

14 of Mongolia's 21 provinces are considered seriously affected.
According to the FAO assessment mission, in 8 provinces, 21 000 herder
families owning between 100 and 300 head of livestock each have lost
more than 50 percent of their herds. The FAO mission stressed the
urgent need to strengthen household food security for the most
vulnerable families to prevent further loss of their assets and
proposed immediate livestock input support for the most vulnerable
herders as a top priority.

In parallel, fodder, supplementary feed and veterinary care is
urgently needed for weak and stressed animals until mid-April 2010,
with funding requirements of USD 6 million. Detailed project profiles
are under preparation for submission to donors.

FAO's Animal Production and Health Commission for Asia and the Pacific
has provided 5000 doses of medicinal food supplement for dairy cows,
pregnant heifers and young bulls as immediate assistance.

Medium-term interventions should focus on disaster preparedness and
risk reduction plans and strategies, and FAO is ready to provide
assistance to the country as required.

Mongolia covers an area of 1.6 million square km, an area roughly the
size of Western Europe.

The FAO mission visited Mongolia from 27 Jan to 1 Feb 2010.

[Based upon the above information, it does not seem that the mortality
in Mongolian antelopes in Zabaykalsk is indeed caused by FMD, as
reportedly suspected. However, in view of the information that the
observed cases led to a decision to vaccinate livestock in Zabaykalsk
against FMD, this suspicion cannot yet be definitely refuted; results
of the epidemiological investigations in Russia are anticipated. -
