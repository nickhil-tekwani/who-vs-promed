Anthrax in 3 new districts
--------------------------
Anthrax has spread to 3 more districts with 56 cases in a Lalmonirhat
village, 5 in Manikganj, and one in Satkhira.

The 56 were detected at Kisamat Harati village in Lalmonirhat Sadar Upazila
for the 1st time, district civil surgeon Jahangir Alam Sarker told
bdnews24.com on Tuesday [7 Sep 2010]. A 5-member medical team led by the
official has been giving treatments to the patients in the affected area.
"The number of patients might increase," he added.

In Satkhira, the patient was a 37 year old woman from the town's Madhur
Mollardangi area. She was admitted to Sadar Upazila Health Complex at
around 3 pm. A photograph of the patient was sent to Mahmudur Rahman, the
director of Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research
(IEDCR), who later confirmed anthrax.

The 5 in Manikganj were detected at Char Airmara village of Fakurhati Union
under Saturia Upazila. Civil surgeon Dr Shiddheswar Majumder said they
consumed meat of a goat on 22 Aug 2010 and lesions appeared on their bodies
on 26 Aug 2010. "They were treated locally and are now recovering," he
said, adding that government officials have visited the affected area. All
the cattle in the area have been vaccinated, livestock officer Hossain
Ahmed said.

To prevent anthrax-infected cattle from entering the capital, the
government on 29Aug 2010 installed 3 check-posts outside Dhaka, where 4
veterinarians have been posted to check.

The disease was 1st identified in Sirajganj on 19 Aug 2010, when at least
26 people including 2 children showed signs of infection at Chithhulia
village under Kayempur of Shahjadpur Upazila. A team of the civil surgeon's
office led by Dr Shariful Islam and district sanitary inspector Ramchandra
Saha visited the village and confirmed the infection. Ramchandra said that,
on 29 Jul 2010, a buffalo of AS and a cow of SA -- both of which had
contracted anthrax -- were slaughtered and their meat was sold off to
villagers.

The disease has reportedly spread to Pabna, Tangail, Kushtia and more areas
across the country.

[There is a confusion of numbers and each news report differs here and
there from the others. The Nation states "that none of the 400 people who
were infected with anthrax have died or been sickened critically. 13 cows
and 17 goats have died and another 217 animals were infected."

I have gone with the more conservative numbers. A variety of animals are
involved -- buffalo, cattle, and goats. See also:

Bangladesh anthrax spreads ahead of Eid
---------------------------------------
Bangladesh has set up anthrax checkpoints at cattle markets as a major
outbreak of the disease spreads through the country's dairy belt, infecting
more than 400 people, officials said on Wednesday [8 Sep 2010].

A total of 8 districts have confirmed human and cattle anthrax infections.
Meat consumption ahead of the Islamic festival of Eid, set to start Friday
[10 Sep 2010], has fallen sharply as panicked consumers have turned their
backs on beef, officials said.

The authorities have set up checkpoints across the country in an effort to
prevent diseased meat reaching the capital Dhaka, said livestock department
deputy director Mosaddek Hossain. "We have sent vets to markets to screen
animals. We want to calm the public down. Already meat consumption has
declined sharply as panicky consumers are avoiding beef," he said.
