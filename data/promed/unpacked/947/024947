_Chlamydia trachomatis_ samples testing falsely negative in the Aptima Combo 2 test in Finland, 2019
----------------------------------------------------------
To the editor: We read with great interest the recent article by Rantakokko-Jalava, et al. about false-negative _Chlamydia trachomatis_ (CT) specimens in the nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) Aptima Combo 2 assay (AC2; Hologic Inc.) [1]. These very important findings indicate that 6-10% of CT-positive cases in Finland might have been missed due to false-negative/equivocal AC2 results. The AC2 false-negative/equivocal CT specimens were observed in several Finnish settings, particularly in southwestern Finland, June 2018-April 2019.

Finnish experts, together with Hologic scientists, quickly determined that the specimens with equivocal/negative CT results in AC2 (target: 23S rRNA) but positive in the Aptima _Chlamydia trachomatis_ assay (ACT; target: 16S rRNA) were not linked to Hologic instruments or reagents. Concurrently, Finnish scientists identified a C1515T mutation in the CT 23S rRNA gene in 10 AC2 false-negative specimens [1].

Further investigation and response is required and will need collaborative action. Hologic has now provided strong evidence that the C1515T mutation is the root cause of the AC2 false-negative/equivocal CT specimens and confirmed in analytical studies that a synthetic RNA transcript corresponding to the CT 23S rRNA with a C1515T mutation yields significantly suppressed CT detection probe-signal in AC2 similar to that observed with AC2 testing of clinical samples containing the mutated CT strain.

It is essential that a broader understanding is developed of the presence and proportion of specimens with mutated CT in Finland and internationally. Sufficient numbers of representative, geographically diverse false-negative AC2 specimens need to be examined in order to exclude the unlikely possibility of additional 23S rRNA mutations affecting detection. Using ACT [target: 16S rRNA] for confirmation of AC2 [target: 23S rRNA] screened specimens provides clinical utility in the short term but is not a feasible long-term solution, because of the high cost and substantially increased work load and time for reporting results imposed by confirming a large number of AC2 equivocal/negative specimens by ACT testing.

Additionally, the different performance characteristics of AC2 and ACT may further confound our understanding of the presence, spread, and possible evolution of the new mutant (or, although unlikely, mutants). This might even result in the use of only ACT in some settings, which would create problems due to the widespread use of AC2 as well as loss of information regarding the presence of mutated specimens, presence of _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, and advantage of reserving ACT for confirmation testing.

Instead, until a revised version of the AC2 test is available, a validated and quality-assured "mutant-specific" research-use-only test is urgently needed to understand the geographic distribution of the CT mutant and its prevalence in screening populations. To fulfil this need, Hologic is rapidly developing an Aptima-format research kit containing a 23S rRNA-mutant detection probe. Surveillance using a test that detects the CT mutant will provide further timely insight into the impact of this CT variant on the effectiveness of CT screening in Finland and additional European countries where elevated levels of AC2 false-negative/equivocal results might be observed. In addition, this mutant-specific assay will generate evidence-based modifications to the current AC2 assay to ensure accuracy of test results and patient safety.

The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) intends to facilitate such preferably centralised study or studies, which will require close collaboration with Finland, additional European Union/European Economic Area countries, other international and national public health organisations, and Hologic.

The key public health priorities include understanding the spread of the CT mutant and ensuring that patients with false-negative results are recalled and tested using alternative NAAT. To address the former, any unexplained changes in CT epidemiology and positivity rate need to be further investigated. In laboratories using AC2, retrospective and prospective review of the AC2 test results (proportions of positive, equivocal, negative test results, and associated relative light units (RLU) of test results) and investigations of any unexplained changes in the CT positivity rate should be performed. In settings with suspected false-negative CT test results by AC2, to ensure patient safety, specimens with low CT RLU values (greater than or equal to 15-99), independent of the result interpretation in the Hologic instruments, need retesting with an appropriate NAAT targeting another genetic sequence (preferably ACT), and not by repeated AC2 testing. The lookback period for recalling patients with verified false-negative results will depend on the local proportion and epidemiology of the CT mutant, taking into account spontaneous clearance of CT infection, social consequences for the patients, potential risk of reinfection, and continuous analysis of positivity rates of retested patients.

Investigation of additional scientific issues will be important in due course (e.g., if it is only one mutated CT clone; the emergence (when, where, and how), transmission, and evolution of the clone(s) in different populations in Finland and possibly other countries; if the clone(s) has(ve) any fitness advantage/disadvantage; if only one or both of the CT 23S rRNA gene alleles are mutated in all specimens and how this affects the number or proportion of mutated 23S rRNA molecules detected in AC2; if the lack of AC2 detection of the clone(s) has increased the risk of CT-associated complications/sequelae; associations between the clone(s) and symptomatic/asymptomatic infection; and the spread in different subpopulations (patient sex, age, sexual orientation, geographic distribution, etc.). Whole-genome sequencing from false-negative AC2 CT specimens is in progress to address several of these issues. Furthermore, a mutant-specific real-time PCR is also under development.

Finally, it is likely that mutants of CT and other infectious agents escaping detection in commercial and laboratory-developed diagnostic NAATs are more common than previously realised and are inevitable consequences of the microbial evolution combined with the high diagnostic-selective pressure on the microorganisms. Several lessons on such diagnostically selected evolution can be learnt from the identification of the Swedish new variant of CT (nvCT) in 2006 and its subsequent spread mainly in Sweden [2-5]. International and national surveillance programmes capturing diagnostic test escape mutants (as well as cross-reacting mutants of other pathogens) for CT and other pathogens should be considered, particularly for diagnostic NAATs with a single genetic target region.

[ProMED-mail regrets the delay but believes that the importance of these journal articles warrants their posting at this time.

The abstract of the journal article referred to in the Eurosurveillance letter to the editor in reference 1 is extracted below:

"Since February 2019, over 160 _Chlamydia trachomatis_ (CT) cases testing negative or equivocal by Aptima Combo 2 (AC2) but positive by Aptima CT test run with Panther instruments occurred in Finland. The AC2 test targets chlamydial 23S rRNA, while the CT test targets 16S rRNA. Sequencing of 10 strains revealed a nucleotide substitution in 23S rRNA. The significance of this for the failure of the AC2 test to detect the variant is not yet known."

_Chlamydia trachomatis_ infection is the most common notifiable disease in the United States with 1.7 million infections reported to CDC in 2017 (https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/infographic-html.htm). Because _Chlamydia trachomatis_ infections are often asymptomatic in both males and females, they are usually discovered through screening programs. Screening populations at risk is important because untreated _C. trachomatis_ infections can lead to serious complications. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), cell culture, direct immunofluorescence, EIA, and nucleic acid hybridization tests are available for the detection of _C trachomatis_. However, NAATs are better than any of the other tests available for the diagnosis of chlamydial and gonococcal infections with respect to overall sensitivity, specificity, and ease of specimen transport (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr6302a1.htm).

Several NAATs are available to amplify and detect _C. trachomatis_-specific and _N. gonorrhoeae_-specific nucleic acid sequences. The Hologic/Gen-Probe Aptima Combo 2 assay replicates a specific region of the 23S rRNA from _C. trachomatis_ and a specific region of the 16S rRNA from _N. gonorrhoeae_ via DNA intermediates. A chemiluminescent-labeled DNA probe combines with amplicon to form stable RNA:DNA hybrids. Light emitted from the chemiluminescent-labeled RNA:DNA hybrids is measured as photon signals in a luminometer, which are reported as relative light units (RLU). The above journal articles report that mutation of the genetic sequence of the _C. trachomatis_ 23S rRNA that the Hologic/Gen-Probe Aptima Combo 2 assay targets, discovered in Finland, compromises this particular NAAT. The letter to the editor above also raises the possibility that mutations in targeted genetic sequences may occur under the selective pressure of diagnostic NAATs, and mutations in targeted genetic sequences of other infectious agents could compromise their detection by the specific NAATs and will require further study. - Mod.ML
