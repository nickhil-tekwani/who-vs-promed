The number of cattle farms affected by a condition suspected so far [up to 11 Oct 2013] to be botulism is about 60 scattered throughout the country. The attack rate ranges between zero (in exposed holdings in which the cattle had been vaccinated with the botulism C & D vaccine according to the producer's protocol) and up to 6 percent in exposed, unvaccinated young cattle.

One of the most severely affected establishments was a fattening enterprise in northern Israel which kept about 1500 male calves which had not been vaccinated, of which 85 (5.6 percent) died. The mortality ceased 14 days after discontinuing the feeding with the suspected poultry litter. The 14-day limit was observed also in other affected establishments supplied with poultry litter from the same source.

The most typical cases were seen in farms which received "commercially traded, treated poultry litter" manufactured and distributed by a central cattle feed plant. The said plant has, reportedly, stopped the operation of the poultry litter treatment line, cleaned and disinfected its facilities, and has now restarted production.

The presently applied diagnostic techniques are based on biological tests which are not sensitive enough; new, molecular identification techniques such as PCR deserve to be developed/used [see comment].

[The reservations of veterinary practitioners regarding the sensitivity (and duration/time required) of the prevailing biological tests (mouse bioassay) used for the diagnosis of botulism in cattle, as expressed in the above report, is a familiar phenomenon. Unfortunately, the wish or conviction that modern techniques, such as PCR, may replace the mouse bioassay at present are yet to be fulfilled. As we noted, the botulism test which is being developed for PCR has a high rate of false positives. This means other methods are likely at this time to be more reliable.

For subscribers' convenience, we provide extracts from the "Diagnostic tests" (for animals) chapter in the "Botulism" review published by The Center for Food Security & Public Health at Iowa State University (CFSPH), updated June 2010 (for the entire review, see http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/botulism.pdf.):

"Botulism can be difficult to diagnose, as the toxin is not always found in clinical samples or the feed. Diagnosis is often a matter of excluding other diseases. A definitive diagnosis can be made if botulinum toxin is identified in the feed, serum/blood, stomach, crop or intestinal contents, vomitus, feces or tissues. The toxin can usually be found in the blood or serum only in the early stages of the disease. Botulinum toxin is typically detected with a mouse bioassay. ELISAs may also be used, but they detect both active and inactivated (e.g., heat treated) toxins, and false positives are possible with this test. Botulinum toxins can be typed using neutralization tests in mice.

_C. botulinum_ organisms may also be isolated from the feed. In toxicoinfectious botulism, the organism may be cultured from the gastrointestinal contents, feces, wounds or other tissues. Because healthy animals can have _C. botulinum_ spores in the gastrointestinal tract, finding them in this location should be interpreted with caution (_C. botulinum_ isolation techniques are described in detail).

Biochemical tests and the detection of volatile metabolic products using gas-liquid chromatography are helpful in identification. The metabolic patterns and other characteristics vary with the strain/group. Definitive identification is by demonstration of the toxin. Molecular techniques can be used for the genetic characterization of _C. botulinum_ and may be helpful in determining the source of an outbreak.

Serology is not used routinely in diagnosis, but antibodies to botulinum toxin have been reported in some animals that recovered, including horses, cattle and a dog. In the dog, paired serum samples revealed a 4-fold increase in titer. Antibodies to type C and/or D botulinum toxin have also been reported in a few golden jackals (_Canis aureus syriacus_) in Israel."

PCR is mentioned only in the review's chapter addressing botulism in humans, which says: "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays that detect the neurotoxin genes can be helpful in identifying _C. botulinum_; however, some genes (silent toxin genes) do not produce active toxin, and the results from this assay are confirmed using the mouse bioassay."
