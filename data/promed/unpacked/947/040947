As the spread of myiasis, a condition where animal or human tissue is
infested with fly larvae or maggots, in the Mahwit governorate
rapidly accelerates, field teams from the General Department for
Animal Resources (GDAR) have ceased working towards combating this
potentially fatal disease.

The teams stopped work 3 weeks ago because, according to Ahmed
Al-Hasibi, director of the Animal Wealth Administration in Mahwit
governorate, "the vector is out of control; it is a fly in the air."

However, 2 teams in Bani Sa'ad, one in Al-Khabt and another in Milhan
are still working towards eradicating the disease.

"At the moment, GDAR field teams have stopped fighting the epidemic.
Because they have not received their salaries from the Ministry of
Agriculture since [3 Dec 2008], they have decided to quit," Al-Hasibi
said.

Al-Hasibi also revealed that the epidemic has caused the deaths of
1465 camels, cows, and sheep in the Mahwit governorate and that those
numbers are increasing.

Mohammed Yahya Abdo, Secretary General of the local council in Milhan
said: "Last week, 22 sheep and 2 cows died in the area of Badh."

The infected animals in Mahwit treated by the field teams include 180
cows, 351 camels, 848 sheep, 998 goats and 295 donkeys and dogs. The
animals that were saved from the epidemic include 9407 cows, 93 489
sheep, 133 080 goats, 1502 camels and 5086 donkeys and dogs. Also,
8445 barns were dealt with by the teams, according to Al-Hasibi. He
added that 2 human cases in Mahwit were reported.

Al-Hasibi calls on the Ministry of Agriculture and the other bodies
concerned to quickly take action against the spread of the disease.
He maintained that multiple areas should be treated at once in a bid
to effectively manage the vector transmission.

Al-Sormi noted that the disease is widespread in 4 districts in the
Mahwit governorate: in Al-Khabt, Milhan, Bani Sa'ad, and Hofash.
Climatic factors are to blame, such as the frequent wet weather found
in the many valleys of the region.

Al-Sormi observed that this event has been totally ignored by the
mass media and questioned the role played by television and radio in
covering this situation. He demanded that they broadcast suitable
content to raise awareness of the issue.

Al-Sormi explained that myiasis is caused by a blue fly that lays her
eggs in the soft tissue of the host. These then hatch, resulting in a
parasitic infestation that lives within the host body, gradually
moving to vital sections of the animal, such as the liver and blood
vessels.

He recommended the following tips: 1st - clean and disinfect any
apparent wounds. 2nd - if you ever see any worms, they are to be
removed and burned. 3rd - keep your everyday environment clean, and
use bug-spray on the fly that spreads this disease.

Al-Sormi explained that the animal most often afflicted is the goat,
but that there are also many cases in sheep and cows.

The Hodeidah governorate, which has a long coastal bar alongside the
Mahwit borders from the west, will be adversely affected by the
outbreak in Mahwit. "Myiasis in Hodeidah is currently under control,
and the teams are working well, but if the situation in Mahwit
continues to deteriorate, then the Tehama will be greatly affected,
since a large section of the Tehama borders Mahwit," said Dr. Fadel
Al-Amri, director of the Veterinary Office in Hodeidah.

He added that these cases were distributed among 143 villages from a
sample of 633 villages.

"Within Hodeidah, Al-Mighlaf, Al-Dehi, Al-Ziadya and parts of
Al-Kanawis district have all been infected with myiasis," Al-Amri
said.

Myiasis entered Yemen in February this year [2008] and hit 3
governorates simultaneously: Hodeidah, Hajjah, and Sa'ada; and by
November this year, the epidemic had appeared in Mahwit on a huge
scale.

"Yemen requires YR 22 billion [USD 110 million] to curb the spread of
myiasis," as Dr. Galib Al-Eryani, General Manager of the Agriculture
Ministry's Animal Wealth Administration told Yemen Times earlier this
year [2008].

In February of this year [2008], 5 human cases were recorded in
Hajjah and Hodeidah.

[The suspected spread of the old world screwworm (OWS) in Yemen was
initially reported in February 2008 by ProMED-mail. The suspicion was
confirmed by the FAO in April 2008.

The official reporting to the OIE is somewhat puzzling: Yemen's
annual reports for the years 2005 and 2006 referred to "O.w.
screwworm (_C. bezziana_)" as a notifiable disease which had never
been reported in Yemen. However, in 2007 and the 1st semester of
2008, the disease is reportedly present but now astonishingly "not
notifiable." A clarification and, in any event, a detailed report to
the OIE on the actual situation is to be anticipated.

Old world screwworm (OWS) is a disease caused by _Chrysomya
bezziana_, a fly which is an obligate parasite of mammals during its
larval stages. OWS is one of the internationally reportable diseases
included in OIE's list of Multiple Species Diseases. The
internationally agreed requirements pertaining to OWS are specified
in article 2.2.8 of OIE's Terrestrial Animal Health Code. Larvae
feeding on the skin and underlying tissues of the host cause a
condition known as wound or traumatic myiasis, which can be fatal.
Infestations are generally acquired at sites of previous wounding due
to natural causes or to animal husbandry practices, but they may also
occur in the mucous membranes of body orifices.

Female flies are attracted to wounds at the edges of which each
female lays an average of 175 eggs. The larvae emerge within 12-24
hours and immediately begin to feed, burrowing head-downwards into
the wound. After growth involving 2 moults, the larvae leave the
wound and drop to the ground into which they burrow to pupate. The
duration of the life-cycle off the host is temperature dependent,
being shorter at higher temperatures, and the whole cycle may be
completed in less than 3 weeks in the tropics.

Treatment is generally effected by application of organophosphorus
insecticides into infested wounds, both to kill larvae and to provide
a residual protection against re-infestation. Preventive measures
include the spraying or dipping of susceptible livestock with
organophosphorus compounds and, more recently, use of avermectins as
subcutaneous injections to animals "at risk." Strict control of the
movement of animals out of affected areas also acts as a preventive
measure.

The distribution of OWS is confined to the Old World, as the name
suggests, throughout much of Africa (from Ethiopia and sub-Saharan
countries to northern South Africa), the Gulf countries, the Indian
subcontinent, and Southeast Asia (from southern China [People's Rep.
of] through the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian and Philippine
islands to Papua New Guinea). OWS was reported from Hong Kong for the
1st time in 2000, infesting dogs, and a 1st human case was reported
in 2003.

The situation in the Gulf area and surrounding regions is dynamic,
with recent reports confirmed from Iran and Iraq. Epidemics of
traumatic myiasis can follow introductions into such areas,
especially where the livestock owners and veterinarians are
unfamiliar with OWS.

OIE's Manual of Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines for Terrestrial Animals

livestock in the Middle and Near East based on eco-climatic
suitability is available at

[Re the human cases, we suppose the fly the report refers to is
_Chrysomya_ (old world screw worm fly) which deposits its eggs in the
ear or nasal cavity. The only thing to do is fly control, and man is
the accidental host. If it is cutaneous myiasis caused by _Cordylobia_
(tumbu flies), the eggs are deposited on the ground and on clothes
left for drying, either hanging or on the ground. In this case ironing
will kill the eggs. The endemic range of _Cordylobia_ is sub-Saharan
Africa, but there is plenty of boat traffic between East Africa and
Yemen. More information on the human cases is requested. - Mods.EP/JW]
