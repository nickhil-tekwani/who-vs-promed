SCRUB TYPHUS (2)
================
Subject: Tsutsugamushi qua "emerging disease"
It is my impression that for funding and P.R. purposes all
communicable diseases are now being touted as "emerging" or
at a minimum "reemerging."
If salmonellosis, TB, meningococcal disease, etc. all qualify
as emergent, I see no reason to discriminate against scrub
typhus.
