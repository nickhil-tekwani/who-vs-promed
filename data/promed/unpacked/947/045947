Virus threatens banana crop
-------------------------------
NOUMEA, 30 April 2001: Authorities in New Caledonia's Northern Province
have declared a bunchy top disease alert in the northern part of the main
island. The alert comes after the French territory's economic development
and environment services (DDEE) were informed by a local farmer that his
banana trees were "suspicious."
DDEE immediately requested a special intervention from New Caledonia's
plant protection services, which confirmed the disease was bunchy top. The
disease, [which is caused by banana bunchy top nanavirus, seriously
affects banana production, and is spread by the banana aphid ( _Pentalonia
nigronervosa_). [The disease was first spotted in New Caledonia nearly 2
years ago, near the capital Noumea.
Stringent steps were then taken by authorities, including roadblocks
mounted by police to check for any motorists transporting infected banana
plants further into the Territory. In recent months, an intensive awareness
campaign has been mounted, including the production and broadcasting of
television spots.
Offenders caught transporting banana plants, infected or not, or refusing
to let their plantations be destroyed to prevent the disease spreading,
have been severely penalized by the local judiciary.
DDEE and plant protection services have meanwhile briefed the Northern
Provincial council members, in order to prevent what is seen as a
potentially severe blow to local food crops.

Massive banana preventive destruction to start
-------------------------------------------------
NOUMEA, 7 May 2001: Authorities in New Caledonia are poised to destroy
banana plants in the North province of the French territory in a bid to
prevent spreading of bunchy top disease, Reseau France Outre-mer (RFO)
reported on [7 May. The campaign is to start on 8 May after Territorial
and Provincial authorities last week decided to strike hard and
systematically eliminate all suspicious banana plants. Since the disease
broke out in the [area last week, an estimated 7 banana plantations are
said to be infested.
Plant protection authorities plan to systematically kill any suspicious
tree by injection of glyphosphate and re-plant with substitution crops that
would help some 65 affected families to survive.
Province President Paul Neaoutyine has responded by initiating a set of
measures, asking for the co-operation of all concerned agencies and
individuals. This included, like in the South [province, a ban of
transportation of any banana plant in the infected area.
Bunchy Top derives its name from the bunch formed by the young leaves at
the top of the banana plant, an indication that the tree had already been
infected for months.
In June 1999, New Caledonia's government took the first disease-fighting
steps: it introduced a compulsory declaration of any sick banana plants and
banned transportation of any banana plant in the infected areas.

[Banana bunchy top nanavirus causes one of the most serious diseases of
banana. The disease was first reported in Fiji in 1889 and Taiwan in 1900.
It is widespread in Southeast Asia, the Philippines, Taiwan, most of the
South Pacific islands, and parts of India and Africa. It is not known to be
present in Central or South America.
Two useful references on the disease are the following:
