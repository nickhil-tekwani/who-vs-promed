62 children confirmed to have lead poisoning
-----------------------------------------------
62 children in Huixian County in Gansu Province in northwest China
have been confirmed to be suffering from lead poisoning and have been
receiving medical treatment, local health sources said.
The youngsters were among 877 people in 2 villages found to have
excessive lead in their blood in August 2006. Of that figure, 334
were children aged one to 14. A nearby smelting plant was blamed for
the problem.
Each of the 877 persons was further checked to see whether they had
actually been poisoned by the lead.
"The 1st group of blood samples involved in the case in August 2006
were tested by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention
(CCDCP), and the blood samples from 62 children were diagnosed as
having moderate or severe lead poisoning," Sun Yajun, deputy director
of the Medical Emergency Office under the Gansu Provincial Health
Department, told China Daily on Monday [9 Oct 2006].
Medical experts say 100-249 mg of lead per liter of blood is
excessive. They say more than 250 mg per liter is evidence of poisoning.
The children, aged between one and 14, have been receiving medical
treatment, the deputy director said.
Yang Jingke, spokesman of the provincial health department, said
regulations had been followed. "In accordance with state standards,
people with excessive lead in their blood must be tested by
authoritative bodies to see if they have been poisoned. So we asked
the CCDCP to test the blood samples for confirmation," Yang said.
Lead poisoning is particularly harmful to children, causing cell
problems and growth disorders. However, patients can be cured over
time with proper medical treatment, doctors said.
According to the local health department, those villagers suffering
from excessive lead in their blood are also receiving treatment.
"We will further test villagers who live in the polluted area," a
spokesman said.
The smelting plant has been closed down by the local government. The
owner and managers have been arrested, according to official sources.

[This article does not state what the treatment was, whether serial
blood levels are being monitored or even whether the children are
improving. It would be especially interesting to know the answers to
these questions, since the previous ProMED-mail post 2006917.2653
indicated they were using vitamins instead of chelation therapy to
treat the children.
Furthermore, there is no indication in the article of whether the
polluted area is being cleaned up or whether we could continue to see
chronic low dose lead poisoning in this area for many years to come. - Mod.TG]
