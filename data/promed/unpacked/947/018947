French Territories: Guadeloupe, Martinique (Caribbean) and Guyane (South America). 15 Mar 2018. (published) Fetuses of prospective cohort of pregnant women with confirmed ZIKV infection were studied. Neurologic and ocular defects possibly associated with ZIKV infection were seen in 39 fetuses and infants. Microcephaly was detected in 32 fetuses and infants of whom 9 were severe. Neurologic and ocular defects were more common when ZIKV infection occurred during the 1st trimester than when it occurred during the 2nd or 3rd trimester.

- Birth defects, USA. CDC analyzed data from 15 U.S. jurisdictions conducting population-based surveillance for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. All 15 U.S. jurisdictions included in this report had existing birth defects surveillance systems that were rapidly adapted to monitor birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. These jurisdictions provided data on live births and pregnancy losses occurring from 1 Jan - 31 Dec 2016. The prevalence of reported birth defects cases potentially related to Zika virus infection increased in jurisdictions with confirmed local transmission, from 2.8 per 1000 live births (182 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 per 1000 live births (211 cases) during the 2nd half (CI = 2.4-3.2 and CI = 2.6-3.4, respectively; p = 0.10). In "higher" Zika prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence was 3.0 per 1000 live births in both the 1st (753 cases) and 2nd (775 cases) halves of 2016. In "lower" prevalence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence declined significantly from 3.4 per 1000 live births (549 cases) during the 1st half of 2016 to 3.0 (492 cases) per 1000 live births during the 2nd half (CI = 3.2-3.7 and CI = 2.8-3.3, respectively; p = 0.002).

- Preparedness USA. In a survey of 10 local health departments, 80 percent have formal and/or informal communication and referral mechanisms between their maternal and child health programs and key agency programs, such as infectious diseases and epidemiology. Also, 78 percent of respondents said they had access to electronic lab results, making it more likely for them to report to surveillance systems. More than 2/3 of them are actively engaged on response activities in their communities, such as providing information to travelers or doing clinician outreach, but are less likely to provide screening and testing services to identify potential birth defects in infants.

Wilmer E. Villamil-Gómez, MD, Eduardo Ramirez-Vallejo, MD, FACP, FACC, Alfonso J. Rodriguez-Morales, MD, MSc, DTM&HFFTM, FACE. Cardiac Compromise in Zika Virus Infection.

Abstract
We have read with interest the case report of Schwartzmann et al reporting a single case of Zika virus (ZIKV) meningoencephalitis, but also with ZIKV propagation to other organs, including the heart. As in other arboviral diseases (dengue and chikungunya), cardiovascular disorders such as arrhythmias, among others, are being observed in previously healthy cases. But there is a lack of publications assessing it. We take this opportunity to discuss 2 cases of pregnant women from an endemic area (Sucre, Colombia), with confirmed ZIKV infection who presented with cardiovascular and electrocardiographical (ECG) alterations (myocarditis).

Dulce H. G. Orofino, Sonia R. L. Passos, Raquel V. C. de Oliveira, Carla Verona B. de Farias, Maria de Fatima M. P. Leite, Sheila M. Pone, et al. Cardiac findings in infants with in utero exposure to Zika virus - a cross sectional study.

Abstract
Background
Antenatal exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV) is related to severe neurological manifestations. A previous study in Brazil reported an increased incidence of non-severe congenital heart defects in infants with diagnosis of congenital Zika syndrome but without laboratory confirmation of ZIKV infection in the mother or infant. The objective of this study is to report echocardiographic (ECHO) findings in infants with laboratory confirmed antenatal exposure to ZIKV.
Methodology
Cross sectional study of cardiologic assessments of infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to ZIKV in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Results
The study enrolled 120 children with a median age of 97 days (1 - 376 days). In utero exposure to ZIKV was confirmed in 97 children (80.8 percent) through positive maternal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) results during pregnancy or a positive PCR result at birth; 23 additional children (19.2 percent) had maternal positive PCR results during pregnancy and postnatally. Of the 120, 48 infants (40 percent) had cardiac defects noted on ECHO and 13 infants (10.8 percent) had major cardiac defects (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus). None of the defects were severe. The frequency of major defects was higher in infants whose mothers had a rash in the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, or who had altered central nervous system (CNS) imaging postnatally or were preterm.
Conclusions
Infants with in utero ZIKV exposure have a higher prevalence of major cardiac defects, however none were severe enough to require immediate intervention. For this reason, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow general newborn screening guidelines, which significantly reduces the burden of performing emergent fetal or neonatal ECHOs in a setting where resources are not available, such as most Brazilian municipalities.
Author summary
We performed cardiologic assessment of 120 infants born between November 2015 and January 2017 with confirmed vertical exposure to Zika virus (ZIKV). The diagnosis of ZIKV exposure was confirmed by PCR in maternal blood specimens and/or amniotic fluid during pregnancy and/or infant specimens including PCR of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or urine following birth. Our study found a 10.8 percent incidence of structural heart defects in infants with a history of intrauterine exposure to ZIKV, a rate considerably higher than that observed in the general population. However, no patients were found to have severe structural heart defects. The presence of major defects was increased in infants whose mothers had a history of rash in the 2nd trimester, infants with altered CNS imaging and/or preterm infants. As severe heart defects requiring immediate intervention were not identified, guidelines for performance of postnatal ECHO in this population should follow the same criteria as the ones applicable to newborns in general, particularly since resources for performance of fetal and neonatal echocardiograms are not routinely available in most Brazilian municipalities

[Although structural heart defects were detected in 11 percent of the infants infected by Zika virus in utero, fortunately, none of these defects was serious enough to require immediate intervention. Heart defects are something that neonatologists in areas of active Zika virus transmission need to be aware of. - Mod.TY]

Kristina M Adams Waldorf, Branden R Nelson, Jennifer E Stencel-Baerenwald, Colin Studholme, Raj P Kapur, Blair Armistead et al. Congenital Zika virus infection as a silent pathology with loss of neurogenic output in the fetal brain.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus with teratogenic effects on fetal brain, but the spectrum of ZIKV-induced brain injury is unknown, particularly when ultrasound imaging is normal. In a pregnant pigtail macaque (_Macaca nemestrina_) model of ZIKV infection, we demonstrate that ZIKV-induced injury to fetal brain is substantial, even in the absence of microcephaly, and may be challenging to detect in a clinical setting. A common and subtle injury pattern was identified, including (i) periventricular T2-hyperintense foci and loss of fetal noncortical brain volume, (ii) injury to the ependymal epithelium with underlying gliosis and (iii) loss of late fetal neuronal progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (temporal cortex) and subgranular zone (dentate gyrus, hippocampus) with dysmorphic granule neuron patterning. Attenuation of fetal neurogenic output demonstrates potentially considerable teratogenic effects of congenital ZIKV infection even without microcephaly. Our findings suggest that all children exposed to ZIKV in utero should receive long-term monitoring for neurocognitive deficits, regardless of head size at birth.

Luiz Carlos Caires-Júnior, Ernesto Goulart, Uirá Souto Melo, Bruno Silva Henrique Araujo, Lucas Alvizi, Alessandra Soares-Schanoski, et al. Discordant congenital Zika syndrome twins show differential in vitro viral susceptibility of neural progenitor cells.

Abstract
Congenital Zika syndrome (CZS) causes early brain development impairment by affecting neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Here, we analyze NPCs from 3 pairs of dizygotic twins discordant for CZS. We compare by RNA-Seq the NPCs derived from CZS-affected and CZS-unaffected twins. Prior to Zika virus (ZIKV) infection the NPCs from CZS babies show a significantly different gene expression signature of mTOR and Wnt pathway regulators, key to a neurodevelopmental program. Following ZIKV in vitro infection, cells from affected individuals have significantly higher ZIKV replication and reduced cell growth. Whole-exome analysis in 18 affected CZS babies as compared to 5 unaffected twins and 609 controls excludes a monogenic model to explain resistance or increased susceptibility to CZS development. Overall, our results indicate that CZS is not a stochastic event and depends on NPC intrinsic susceptibility, possibly related to oligogenic and/or epigenetic mechanisms.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) is a vector-borne flavivirus that has caused recent outbreaks associated with serious disease in infants and newborns in the Americas. _Aedes_ mosquitoes are the primary vectors for ZIKV, but little is known about the diversity of mosquitoes that can transmit ZIKV in North America. We chose 3 abundant North American mosquito species (_Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_) and one known vector species (_Aedes aegypti_), fed them blood meals supplemented with a recent outbreak ZIKV strain, and tested bodies, legs, and saliva for infectious ZIKV. ZIKV was able to infect, disseminate, and be transmitted by _Aedes aegypti_. However, _Anopheles freeborni_, _Anopheles quadrimaculatus_, and _Culex tarsalis_ were unable to be infected. We conclude that these species are unlikely to be involved in ZIKV transmission in North America. However, we should continue to examine the ability for other mosquito species to potentially act as ZIKV vectors in North America.

Lin Jin, Xiaomin Guo, Chuanbin Shen, Xue Hao, Peng Sun, et al. Salivary factor LTRIN from Aedes aegyptifacilitates the transmission of Zika virus by interfering with the lymphotoxin-β receptor

Abstract
Pathogens have co-evolved with mosquitoes to optimize transmission to hosts. Mosquito salivary-gland extract is known to modulate host immune responses and facilitate pathogen transmission, but the underlying molecular mechanisms of this have remained unknown. In this study, we identified and characterized a prominent 15-kilodalton protein, LTRIN, obtained from the salivary glands of the mosquito _Aedes aegypti_. LTRIN expression was upregulated in blood-fed mosquitoes, and LTRIN facilitated the transmission of Zika virus (ZIKV) and exacerbated its pathogenicity by interfering with signaling through the lymphotoxin-β receptor (LTβR). Mechanically, LTRIN bound to LTβR and 'preferentially' inhibited signaling via the transcription factor NF-κB and the production of inflammatory cytokines by interfering with the dimerization of LTβR during infection with ZIKV. Furthermore, treatment with antibody to LTRIN inhibited mosquito-mediated infection with ZIKV, and abolishing LTβR potentiated the infectivity of ZIKV both in vitro and in vivo. This study provides deeper insight into the transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in nature and supports the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the action of LTRIN to disrupt ZIKV transmission.

Franck Touret, Magali Gilles, Raphaelle Klitting, Fabien Aubry, Xavier de Lamballerie, Antoine Nougairede. Live Zika virus chimeric vaccine candidate based on a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone.

Abstract
Zika virus (ZIKV) recently dispersed throughout the tropics and sub-tropics causing epidemics associated with congenital disease and neurological complications. There is currently no commercial vaccine for ZIKV. Here we describe the initial development of a chimeric virus containing the prM/E proteins of a ZIKV epidemic strain incorporated into a yellow fever 17-D attenuated backbone. Using the versatile and rapid ISA (Infectious Subgenomic Amplicons) reverse genetics method, we compared different constructs and confirmed the need to modify the cleavage site between the pre-peptide and prM protein. Using an immunocompromised mouse model, we demonstrate that mice infected with the chimeric virus produced levels of neutralizing antibodies close to those observed following infection with ZIKV and that pre-immunized mice were protected against subsequent viscerotropic and neuroinvasive virus following challenge with a heterologous strain of ZIKV. These data provide a sound basis for the future development of this ZIKV vaccine candidate.

Highlights
- The Liaison® XL Zika Capture IgM assay (LZ-CAM) is compared to Zika IgM ELISAs.
- LZ-CAM shows lower sensitivity but higher specificity than the recommended ELISA.
- Most commercial Zika IgM immunoassays show lower sensitivity than LZ-CAM.
- LZ-CAM greatly reduces laboratory resources and sample turnaround time.

Abstract
Due to the increase of Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission throughout the world, many commercial kits have recently become available to aid in laboratory diagnosis of ZIKV infections in clinical samples. Here, we analyze the fully automated Liaison® XL Zika Capture immunoglobulin M (IgM) assay against the recommended IgM-captureenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

[The need for specific and sensitive diagnostic tests that can differentiate Zika virus antibodies from those to other flavivirus is a recognized need. A recent report indicated development of t a high-density microarray comprising nonredundant 12-mer peptides that tile, with one-residue overlap, the proteomes of Zika, dengue, yellow fever, West Nile, Ilheus, Oropouche, and chikungunya viruses. Serological analysis enabled discovery of a ZIKV NS2B 20-residue peptide that had high sensitivity (96.0 percent) and specificity (95.9 percent) versus natural infection with or vaccination against dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, or Japanese encephalitis virus in a microarray assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of early-convalescent-phase sera (2 to 3 weeks after onset of symptomatic infection). (http://mbio.asm.org/content/9/2/e00095-18). This blood test called ZIKV-NS2B-concat ELISA is faster, less expensive, and extends the window of accurate detection from weeks to months after the onset of infection, giving clinicians a powerful new tool to screen for Zika throughout pregnancy. - Mod.TY]

[10] Postnatal infection

Postnatal Zika virus infection is associated with persistent abnormalities in brain structure, function, and behavior in infant macaques.

Postnatal perturbation by Zika virus
Much of the concern surrounding Zika virus infections focuses on fetuses infected in utero. Mavigner et al. reasoned that this neurotropic virus may have deleterious effects even after birth, so they set up a postnatal infection model to investigate. They found that infant rhesus macaques infected with Zika virus also had peripheral and central nervous system pathology. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging studies revealed that macaques that had been infected with Zika virus had structural and functional abnormalities and also altered emotional responses. These differences persisted months after the virus had been cleared. Although the work involved a small number of animals, their results suggest that infants and young children exposed to Zika virus should undergo more than just routine monitoring.

Abstract
The Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic is associated with fetal brain lesions and other serious birth defects classified as congenital ZIKV syndrome. Postnatal ZIKV infection in infants and children has been reported; however, data on brain anatomy, function, and behavioral outcomes following infection are absent. We show that postnatal ZIKV infection of infant rhesus macaques (RMs) results in persistent structural and functional alterations of the central nervous system compared to age-matched controls. We demonstrate ZIKV lymphoid tropism and neurotropism in infant RMs and histopathologic abnormalities in the peripheral and central nervous systems including inflammatory infiltrates, astrogliosis, and Wallerian degeneration. Structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI/rs-fMRI) show persistent enlargement of lateral ventricles, maturational changes in specific brain regions, and altered functional connectivity (FC) between brain areas involved in emotional behavior and arousal functions, including weakened amygdala-hippocampal connectivity in 2 of 2 ZIKV-infected infant RMs several months after clearance of ZIKV RNA from peripheral blood. ZIKV infection also results in distinct alterations in the species-typical emotional reactivity to acute stress, which were predicted by the weak amygdala-hippocampal FC. We demonstrate that postnatal ZIKV infection of infants in this model affects neurodevelopment, suggesting that long-term clinical monitoring of pediatric cases is warranted.

[Although the numbers of infant monkeys is small, it provides enough evidence to justify evaluation of infants that have been infected with Zika virus as neonates. - Mod.TY]

[The Zika virus outbreak in the Americas has diminished compared to the past 2 years (2016 and 2017), perhaps due to a smaller susceptible cohort of the human population. There are no reports yet of wide-spread reduction in the population of vector mosquitoes (_Aedes aegypti_) in the areas where Zika virus transmission has been frequent. It seems unlikely that Zika virus has disappeared from the Americas, and occurrence of sporadic outbreaks in the Americas would not be surprising. An epidemiologically important but yet unanswered question is if Zika virus has become established in non-human primates in the tropical Americas and can be transmitted by forest mosquitoes, in a sylvan maintenance cycle, as yellow fever virus has. - Mod.TY]
