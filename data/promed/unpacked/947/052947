Taipei County Health Department said that 5 people complained of
headache and diarrhea upon their return from India. Of these, 2 are
confirmed to have paratyphoid.

The 2 cases went to India for a spiritual growth course. One began to
have symptoms on 22 June 2010, while still in India. The person had
headache, watery diarrhea, anorexia, malaise, and fever. She sought
medical attention while in India, but her symptoms did not improve.
Upon returning to Taiwan, she was hospitalized on 12 Jul 2010. The
patient has since been discharged. The other patient had similar
symptoms, and is still hospitalized.

Investigation revealed that there were 87 people who went to the same
spiritual course. So far, 5 people have reported symptoms and sought
medical attention.

Investigation showed that during 18-27 Jun 2010, 88 people from Taiwan
and 9 other countries attended the Oneness Process at the Oneness
University in Varadaiahpalem, Chittoor District, Andhra Pradesh,
India. Upon returning to Taiwan, 5 persons reported gastrointestinal
symptoms with fever. Some had symptom onset while in India.

So far, a total of 40 people have reported gastrointestinal symptoms.
_Salmonella paratyphi_ was isolated from 7 patients [whether this is
type A, B or C is not stated - Mod.LL].

While attending the Oneness Process in India, attendees lived in rooms
housing 10-12 persons from different countries. Because of the
possibility that attendees from [more] countries might also be
affected, we are reporting this incident.

[ProMED thanks Drs. Chuang and Huang for contributing this report
which has added value because of the possibility of cases being found
in other countries.

Paratyphoid fever is similar to typhoid fever, in that both are
enteric fever types of disease, although the former can be, but is not
necessarily, less severe. The paratyphoid salmonellas are divided into
A, B and rarely now C. _Salmonella paratyphi_, also referred to as _S.
enterica_ serotype Paratyphi. Types B and C also have species, now
serotypes, _schottmuelleri_ and _hirschfeldii_, respectively. Like
typhoid, paratyphoid is generally considered not to be a zoonosis,
with [only] humans as the reservoir, but the paratyphoid bacillus has
been isolated from domestic animals and fish.

In India, paratyphoid A has become an increasing problem, accounting
for up to 45 percent of cases of enteric fever in 1998 (1). Although
initially quite sensitive to antimicrobials, strains have become more
resistant to quinolones; in contrast, _S. typhi_ has manifested
resistance for some time.

In a recent report regarding differential risk factors for typhoid and
paratyphoid in Indonesia, the authors found that the infections seemed
to have distinct routes of transmission (2). Typhoid was associated
with factors within a household (recent case in the house, no soap for
handwashing, sharing of food from the same plate, no toilet in the
house), whereas paratyphoid was associated with sources outside the
household such as food from street vendors and flooding.
