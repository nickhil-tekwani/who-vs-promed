The National Institute of Agricultural and Forestry Innovation (INIAF) in Bolivia began investigating the presence of the _Fusarium_ fungus in banana plantations in Chapare [Cochabamba Department] this week.

"We heard of the appearance of this fungus via press reports and thus, we have taken samples and are conducting laboratory tests," said INIAF. They said that the investigations and laboratory results might take between 10 and 15 days.

In turn, representatives of the Banana Producers Union (Unabana) and the Ebita company denied that the _Fusarium_ was affecting 2 out of 10 hectares [5 of 25 acres] of banana, as was reported last week [week of 7 Oct 2013] by the regional coordinator of the Phytosanitary Certification Program (PROCEF).

Ebita and Unabana asked producers to report any problems in their plantations to prevent the fungus from spreading. Other pests such as the black sigatoka and the BSV [_Banana streak virus_] transmitted by the mealybug, if left unchecked, could [also] affect banana plantations.

[Panama disease of banana (PD, also called fungal or fusarium wilt) is caused by the soilborne fungus _Fusarium oxysporum_ f.sp. _cubense_. Symptoms include yellowing, wilting, and streaking of pseudostem, and affected plants die rapidly. The pathogen is highly infectious and is spread by infected planting material, mechanical means (including people and insect activities), soil, and water. It can survive in the soil for decades, and consequently crop rotation with non-hosts is not likely to control the disease effectively.

Disease management for PD is difficult and mostly relies on phytosanitation for pathogen exclusion. No effective chemical or cultural control measures are available, and integrated approaches have been developed (ProMED-mail post 20090419.1483) which may include cultural practices, certified clean planting material, and biocontrol agents. Breeding programmes and molecular techniques are being used to develop crop cultivars with increased resistance to the different fungal strains. Constant vigilance is required in areas where the fungus is present to prevent flare-ups and recognise emerging new strains.

Several races of the pathogen exist varying in host range. Cavendish varieties (see link below) include most of today's commercial eating bananas because they were resistant to the original strain which appeared in central America in the 1950s. However, new fungal strains affecting Cavendish have appeared since the early 1990s and currently include temperate and tropical races 4, as well as a new strain of race 1 reported recently from India (ProMED-mail post 20101223.4510). So far Cavendish-affecting strains seem to be limited to Asia and Oceania, but they are of great concern to the industry worldwide. For example, every Cavendish plantation in Malaysia was wiped out within 4 years of the detection of Tropical Race 4 in the country.

Black sigatoka (caused by the fungus _Mycosphaerella fijiensis_) has been identified as an emerging banana disease in Bolivia (ProMED-mail post 20130504.1690667). _Banana streak virus_ (BSV; genus _Badnavirus_) was reported from neighbouring Peru in 2007 (ProMED-mail post 20070810.2601); it is transmitted by mealybugs and with infected plant material (suckers or tissue cultures for planting) and causes problems for the development of new _Musa_ hybrids worldwide.
