[From a previous post: In my experience with _Kogia_ (both in Florida and
California) all stranded _Kogia_ are clinically ill, often emaciated,
typically are dehydrated and universally have gastric ulcers and ascarid
infections. - Mod T.G.
Cetaceans do not harbour ascarids - I think you mean ascaridoids (the
Superfamily is Ascaridoidea). Ascaridoids in cetaceans include the anisakid
(Family Anisakidae) _Anisakis_. Pigmy and dwarf sperm whales in Florida
have been reported to be infected with _Anisakis typica_ and _Anisakis
catodontis_ respectively.
Other anisakids (_Pseudoterranova_, _Contracaecum_, _Phocascaris_) occur in
pinnipeds. Two other ascaridoids occur in sirenians, _Heterocheilus_
(Family: Heterocheilidae) and the ascaridid (Family: Ascarididae)
_Paradujardinia_.
