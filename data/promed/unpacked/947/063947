An update from Humboldt County health leaders regarding the bacterial infection outbreak that's been plaguing the area. Officials are indicating they have now confirmed 4 additional shigellosis cases in Eureka in recent days. 2 of those confirmed cases required hospitalizations. So far, it's believed there have been several dozen cases.

Health experts initially thought the outbreak was tied to a pair of local laundromats where infected individuals washed clothes. Cases have since spread throughout the Eureka 101 Corridor and beyond. Health experts say washing your hands and practicing good hygiene is the best way to protect yourself from _Shigella_.

[In late 2021, an outbreak of shigellosis occurred in San Diego County in Southern California. This increasing cluster is in Humboldt County, which is in the far north of the state. The exact mode of the person-to-person spread here is unclear.

_Shigella_ was discovered more than 100 years ago by the Japanese microbiologist Kiyoshi Shiga, for whom the genus is named. There are 4 species: _S. boydii_, _S. dysenteriae_, _S. flexneri_, and _S. sonnei_. _Shigella_ organisms can survive transit through the stomach because they are less susceptible to acid than other bacteria; for this reason, as few as 10-100 organisms can cause disease. Ingested bacteria pass into the small intestine where they multiply; large numbers of bacteria then pass into the colon, where they enter the colonic cells. Given its relatively low infectious dose, transmission can occur via contaminated food and water or via direct person-to-person spread, including sexual practices commoner in men who have sex with men. Humans are the only natural reservoir for the disease.

The bacterium is the classical cause of bacterial dysentery (formerly known as flux or the bloody flux), an inflammatory disorder of the colon, which results in severe diarrhea containing mucus and/or blood in the feces with fever, abdominal pain, and rectal tenesmus (pain while passing diarrhea). - Mod.LL
