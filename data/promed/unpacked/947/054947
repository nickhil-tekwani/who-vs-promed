Several health authority areas in north west England have been affected by
an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis since cryptospridial oocysts (3.4/L) were
detected in routine 10L grab samples of water originating [in a reservoir
[and obtained on 20 April 1999 from a water treatment works at Grasmere,
Cumbria. The local water company declared a major incident on 23 April,
when the results of testing became available, and met with consultants in
communicable disease control (CCDCs) and regional epidemiologists the next
day. It was agreed that a 'boil water' notice would be inappropriate given
that most of the water would have already been used and subsequent samples
were within the normal range (less than or equal to 0.2/L), but that
surveillance for cryptosporidiosis should be enhanced.
During the following week it became clear that several health authorities
were reporting a sudden increase in reports of cryptosporidiosis. CDSC
North West is aware of 217 cases reported to CCDCs between 1 April and 12
May, 188 of whom have been reported since 25 April. The occurrence of 188
cases in 17 days in a population of 1.5 million represents a crude
annualised incidence of 270 per 100,000 population, compared with 7/100,000
in England and Wales in 1998 overall (based on 3745 laboratory reports and
a population of 52 million).
Faecal specimens from affected people have been typed at the PHLS Food
Hygiene Laboratory: all have been identified as _Cryptosporidium parvum_ of
genotype 2 (the zoonotic strain. _Cryptosporidium_ has also been identified
in 12 out of 32 faecal specimens taken from sheep grazing around the
reservoir.
