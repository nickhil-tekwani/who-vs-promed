Two people have been confirmed dead after testing positive to Lassa fever at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital [AKTH] in Kano. An unconfirmed source told The Guardian that the victims - a father and his son -- were brought to the hospital from a nearby village but died of the disease a day later.

Assistant director, public affairs at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Mallam Aminu Inuwa, who confirmed the development however declined to reveal further details on the victims. Aminu hinted that, "the affected persons, a father and his son, were brought to the hospital from an undisclosed location. They were confirmed to have contracted Lassa fever after diagnosis. The 2 of them died last week, but the hospital is taking necessary measures to check the development and I can assure you action is being taken against this."

Efforts to confirm the outbreak at the state Ministry of Health did not yield positive result as the commissioner for health Dr Kabiru Ibrahim Getso was said to be attending state executive council meeting.

But in an exclusive telephone interview with The Guardian, the executive secretary of Centre for Disease Control in Nigeria, Prof Abdulsalam Nasidi, confirmed that the death of the 2 people at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital was caused by Lassa fever [virus].

[A reliable source indicated that 2 patients admitted at A&E on 3 Dec 2015, a father and son, were diagnosed with Lassa fever. They both died on 4 Dec 2015. Since today [24 Dec 2015] marks the 21st following admission, and being the longest possible period of incubation, it can be said that mercifully, none of our hospital staff got infected. However, 4 of the close contacts of these deceased at home have developed fever and Lassa virus RNA was identified. The hospital management has placed the case definition of Lassa in all the entry points of the AKTH. In addition, personal protection equipment, infrared thermometers, and a designated place to keep any additional cases has been identified.

The latest Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Nigeria Federal Ministry of Health Bulletin No. 5 (44) issued on 6 Nov 2015 indicated that Lassa fever cases were reported in 12 states in Nigeria this year (see proved-mail archive no. 20151125.3819446). Kano was not among the states listed, so the above cases may the the 1st for Kano this year (2015). As noted in the comments in ProMED-mail archive no. 20150228.3199551: "Lassa fever virus [LFV] is endemic in Nigeria, and multi-mammate mice (_Mastomys_ spp.) are the rodent hosts. Lassa fever is now a serious problem in 23 of the 36 states of that country."

LFV can be transmitted from person to person through contact with an infected individual's viremic blood in the absence of adequate personal protective equipment. Several cases of transmission have occurred in hospitals. Fortunately, there were no cases among the Kano AKTH staff in the above instance.

As Mod.CP pointed out in his comment in archived posting 20130131.1524034: "In the countries of Africa, such as Nigeria, where Lassa fever is endemic, the disease is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While Lassa fever infection is normally mild or has no observable symptoms in about 80 per cent of people infected with the virus, the remaining 20 per cent have a severe, multisystem disease. Rarely, Lassa fever is associated with epidemics, during which the case-fatality rate can reach 50 per cent. There is no preventative vaccine or treatment. The antiviral drug ribavirin has been used with success in Lassa fever patients."

The virus is a member of the family _Arenaviridae_ and causes acute hemorrhagic fever. It is transmitted to humans from contact with food or household items contaminated with excreta of the reservoir rodent host. In the absence of adequate infection control measures, person-to-person virus transmission can occur in houses or in hospital environments, or in laboratories testing samples from patients.
