Summary
Report type: immediate notification
Date of start of the event: 14 Apr 2014
Date of pre-confirmation of the event: 18 Apr 2014
Report date: 22 Apr 2014
Reason for notification: reoccurrence of a listed disease
Date of previous occurrence: 6 Aug 2013
Manifestation of disease: clinical disease
Causal agent: Low pathogenic avian influenza virus
Serotype: H5
Nature of diagnosis: laboratory (advanced)
This event pertains to a defined zone within the country

New outbreaks (1)
Summary of outbreaks:
Total outbreaks: 1
Outbreak 1: Stanislaus County, Stanislaus, California
Date of start of the outbreak: 14 Apr 2014
Outbreak status: continuing (or date resolved not provided)
Epidemiological unit: farm
Total animals affected:
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Birds / 116 000 / - / - / - / - /
Affected population: the affected premise is a commercial Japanese quail (_Coturnix japonica_) layer flock. The quail flock consists of 2 houses. The affected layer house contains approximately 56 000 adult quail. The brooder house contains approximately 39 000 quail. There are 9 additional houses on the premises that house Peking ducks for egg production and contain approximately 21 600 ducks.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: unknown or inconclusive
Epidemiological comments: the USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation of this event. Epidemiological summary of the event as of 22 Apr 2014:
- A commercial Japanese quail (_Coturnix japonica_) layer flock was experiencing increased mortality in the adult laying population. Samples were submitted for laboratory testing and were confirmed positive for influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H5.
- The amino acid sequence at the hemagglutinin protein cleavage site of the laboratory specimen is compatible with North American low pathogenic avian influenza virus. The sequence is 99.1 percent similar to A/American green-winged teal/Wisconsin 10OS3127/2010.
- The index premises and two epidemiologically linked premises were placed under quarantine.
- Laboratory testing for influenza A virus (IAV) on the two epidemiologically linked premises was negative for IAV.
- Depopulation of adult quail on affected premises began.
- The epidemiological investigation and response to the event are continuing.

Note by the OIE Animal Health Information Department: H5 and H7 avian influenza in its low pathogenic form in poultry is a notifiable disease as per Chapter 10.4. on avian influenza of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2013).

Control measures
Measures applied: stamping out; quarantine; vaccination prohibited; no treatment of affected animals
Measures to be applied: no other measures

[Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) occurs naturally in wild birds and can spread to domestic birds.

The LPAI serotype identified previously by USA was H7N7 in Arkansas (June 2013). See final report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013878_20130808_174514.pdf

Japanese quail (_Coturnix japonica_) are hardy birds that thrive in small cages and are inexpensive to keep. They are affected by common poultry diseases but are fairly disease resistant. The females are characterised by light tan feathers with black speckling on the throat and upper breast. The males have rusty brown throat and breast feathers. Japanese quail eggs are a mottled brown colour and are often covered with a light blue, chalky material. http://www.thepoultrysite.com/articles/607/raising-japanese-quail.
