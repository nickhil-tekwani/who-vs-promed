ALMATY, July 10 - Kazakhstan officials have temporarily banned kebabs,
called shashlik, in the country's capital.
The ban was instituted after five people were hospitalized from eating meat
infected with anthrax, said Altai Sharbakov, deputy director of the city
sanitation and epidemiological department.
The victims were in satisfactory condition Friday. Over 100 restaurants and
cafes in the capital will have to find alternative dishes to serve their
customers for at least another week.
Anthrax can be fatal. It is a bacterial disease of sheep, cattle, horses
and goats which is transmissible to humans.

[The most common forms of transmission to humans is by exposure to an
infected animal carcasses usually resulting in the more benign cutaneous
form of anthrax and inhalation anthrax via exposure to viable spores
resident in animal by-products such as hides or wool.
Transmission to humans by milk or meat is rare and usually found when
people are starving. Recall ProMED-mail's early postings on the Rift
Valley Fever outbreak-Hemorrhagic disease - Kenya (06) 980101180736. All
over the world, the clinical signs of animal anthrax are drilled into
veterinary students in order to prevent their exposure should they face a
clinical case. The animal dies suddenly but the post mortem signs of blood
oozing from every orifice and other features should be recognizable. So,
one wonders how did the animal enter the food chain? It may be that [an
enhanced veterinary meat inspection infrastructure [is important in
preventing the re-emergence of this disease in some situations. - Mod.PC.
