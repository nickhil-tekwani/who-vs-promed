Avian influenza situation in Bangladesh
---------------------------------------
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People's
Republic of Bangladesh, has confirmed a case of human infection with
avian influenza A (H5N1) virus. The case was detected through the
influenza sentinel surveillance centre run by the Institute of
Epidemiology Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) and the
International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh
(ICDDR,B).

The case is a 16-month-old female from Kamalapur, Dhaka. She
presented at a influenza sentinel surveillance on 8 Mar 2011 with a
history of cough and fever and subsequently recovered.

A detailed epidemiological investigation and contact follow-up is
being conducted by a team of epidemiologists from IEDCR, ICDDRB, and
WHO Bangladesh. The case was confirmed as being infected with A(H5N1)
by the Institute of Epidemiology Disease Control and Research
(IEDCR).

[This is the WHO confirmation of the case reported in ProMED-mail
report: "Avian influenza, human (25): Bangladesh (DA) 20110315.0826".
This is only the 2nd human case of avian influenza (H5N1) in humans to
have been recorded in Bangladesh. The previous case was a 16-month-old
child from the same area in 2008. Both this infection and the previous
case involved young children and appear to have been mild, detected
during routine influenza surveillance.

According to the WHO Table of the Cumulative Number of Confirmed
Human Cases of Avian Influenza A/(H5N1) Reported to WHO, updated to 16
Mar 2011, the global total of cases is now 534, of whom 311 have been
fatal
(http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/country/cases_table_2011_03_16/en/index.html>).
The number of cases recorded so far in 2011 is 18 (Bangladesh 1,
Cambodia 3, Egypt 11, Indonesia 3).
