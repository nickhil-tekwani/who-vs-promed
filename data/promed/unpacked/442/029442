KELSEYVILLE, Calif.-- As many as a dozen people luxuriating in the
"spiritual, healing" effervescence of Northern California's Soda Springs
may have been asphyxiated over the years by carbon dioxide bubbling out
of the hot spring's water. The pool is encircled by a natural rock
border, but a few years ago someone built up the wall with bricks and
concrete, making it about 2 feet higher. The higher wall made the basin
cozier, but it also apparently trapped the gas close to the surface of
the water. The most recent victim was a 31-year-old male of Napa, who
died alone in the pool July 28, said Phil Damon, an assistant field
manager with the federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM), which owns the
land.
"From our documentation, and it's minimal, we know for sure there have
been 3 deaths and probably there have been 4 times that many," Damon said
last week. The earliest documented death by asphyxiation at the springs
was John "Pop" O'Shea, a former Lake County coroner who died in 1878,
Damon said. Another man, who was not identified, died in 1981. Soda
Springs sits at the edge of a small island about 200 feet off the shore
of Clear Lake, about 120 miles north of San Francisco. The water in the
rectangular 6-by-8-foot pool smells vaguely of rotten eggs and the
basin's natural back walls are encrusted with a multicolored patina of
chemicals.
Carbon dioxide comes up through inactive volcanic vents [sic], making the
water bubble like a hot tub, or a bottle of soda. Damon said locals
erected the wall to cloister the springs from the lake's waters, which
tended to lap in and cool the 90-degree pool. The BLM tore down the wall
last week, and the springs are now off limits. Warning signs sit in the
effervescent waters, strung together by a chain.
The plan is to reopen the springs when the BLM determines carbon dioxide
levels are safe, then install a wall that can be adjusted to the changing
lake levels to allow for ample circulation, Damon said. Without proper
air flow, dangerous levels of carbon dioxide hover over the surface, said
Cathy Janik, a U.S. Geological Survey geochemist. "I'll tell you, I
wouldn't want to sit in the spring, just because there's so much gas,"
she said.
Officially, the cause of victim's death has not been determined and lab
results are expected to take several weeks, according to Russell Perdock,
Lake County's coroner. Preliminary autopsy results showed the victim
drowned, he said. But Damon said he believes the young man was
asphyxiated, and the victim's father said drowning as the cause of death
is "basically impossible as far as I'm concerned, unless someone was
holding his head down." He said his son was an accomplished water skier,
swimmer and diver. After his son's death, the father hired a chemist who
said the carbon dioxide level was so high, his meter could not register
it.
