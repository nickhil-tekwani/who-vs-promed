Switzerland discovers 2 new cases of mad cow disease
---------------------------------------------------
In Switzerland, 2 new cases of mad cow disease have been discovered in the
western and central cantons of Fribourg and Lucerne, the national
veterinary office said on Sat, 16 Nov 2002.
The discoveries bring to 21 the total number of cases of Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy (BSE) identified in Switzerland since the start of the year.
A total of 42 cases of the deadly brain-wasting disease were recorded in
Switzerland in 2001, against 33 the previous year.
Switzerland relaxed in July 2002 its BSE slaughter rules, announcing that
it would stop automatically slaughtering all descendants of cattle which
are found to have the disease from the start of next year.
The decision was made on the basis of evidence showing that mother-to-calf
transmission was extremely rare and that a risk existed only in the 2 years
preceding diagnosis of the disease.

Italy has 80 confirmed "mad cow" disease cases
---------------------------------------------
The number of confirmed cases in Italy of "mad cow" disease, or bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), has risen to 80 following tests on tissue
samples from 2 cows, the Health Ministry announced Friday.
The tests were carried out at a special laboratory in Turin. One of the
cows was from the province of Mantua and the other from Treviso.
Italy has so far carried out over 1 million tests for the brain-wasting
disease since it launched a BSE testing program in Jan 2001 in compliance
with the European Union regulations. All cows over 24 months old now have
to undergo such testing prior to slaughter.
A government task force was set up and BSE control measures were introduced
last February after the discovery of the first suspected case of the human
form of the brain-wasting disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease
(vCJD), in a young Sicilian woman. The case of vCJD was confirmed last month.
[During 2001, 50 BSE cases were recorded in Italy. Since the publication of
this posting, 3 additional cases have been identified, bringing the total
number of BSE cases in Italy accumulating during the current year to 33. -

Denmark confirms 10th case of mad cow disease
---------------------------------------------
Denmark's 10th case of mad cow disease was confirmed Wed, 20 Nov 2002,
veterinary authorities said.
The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration said that 2 tests were done
on a 4-year-old milking cow that was found dead in early November, adding
that both tests were positive.
The cow was part of a herd of 108 animals that was quarantined after being
tested on 6 Nov 2002. The carcass was destroyed, and all the animals on the
farm in the northern part of the Jutland peninsula in western Denmark will
be killed. Other 7 cows sold to 4 different Danish farms will be destroyed,
too.
Per Kuhlman-Schaap, an agency spokesman, said 74 cows had been exported
from the farm to the Netherlands, 4 to Poland, and 2 to Kuwait since 2000.
He said a decision on the fate of those animals is the responsibility of
those countries.
Denmark's most recent BSE case was reported 23 Oct 2002 in a milking cow at
a farm in Jutland. In this Scandinavian country, 10 cases of BSE -- 9 in
Danish-born cows and 1 in a cow imported from Scotland in 1992 -- have been
detected.
[The following complementary information is derived from another posting on
the same issue in the same web-site and of the same date (kindly translated
from Danish by Dr Hanna Adler - thanks!]
"The cow died on the farm and was sent for incineration. From there,
according to the prevailing routine, a sample was sent for BSE testing to a
private laboratory. On 6 Nov 2002 the sample tested positive. A brain
sample was then sent to Denmark`s Veterinary Institute ,which confirmed the
diagnosis on 20 Nov 2002.
As a result, the following steps have been undertaken:
1.The whole herd from which the cow originated and all animals sold to
other farms will be killed and incinerated. Animals older then 24 months
from the herd will be tested for BSE.
2.The Danish Plant Directorate is looking for a potential feed-related
source of transmission. The result will be published later.
3.The case will be made known to other countries through Danish embassies
and delegations.
The current BSE situation in Denmark is as follows:
Counting this last case of Mad Cow Disease, there have been 10 cases of BSE
in Danish-born cattle: one case during 2000, 6 during 2001 and 3 during
2002. In addition, there was one case in an imported animal from Scotland
in 1992 and one in an animal exported from Denmark to Portugal.
The incidence of the disease in Denmark must still be considered low and
the number of cases for 2002 is not expected to deviate from the latest
prognosis". - Mod.AS]

A BSE case in Boekel
--------------------
A case of BSE has been recorded in a cow 4.5 years old in a farm in Boekel
(North Brabant).
This is the 51th case of BSE in the Netherlands since 1997, and the 23rd
during 2002.
The cow, "Sientje 54", born on 1 Feb 1998, has been forwarded by the owner
for incineration on 12 Nov 2002. The rapid BSE-test was found positive on
16 Nov 2002, followed by a confirmatory test which has become positive on
21 Nov 2002.
There have been no suspicious clinical signs in any of the other 72 bovines
on the farm. "Sientje 54" was born and reared on the same farm in Boekel. .
As usual, an investigation into the feed will be carried out, with special
reference to the feed consumed during the first months of the [life of
the?] affected cow. The cows on the farm have been evacuated [destroyed?].
The same will be done with all animals from the said farm that have reached
other farms.
[During the whole of 2001, 20 BSE cases have been recorded in the
Netherlands, compared to 23 during the first 10.5 months of 2002. - Mod AS]

bringing the total number of cases so far this year to 303.
The new cases were detected in Meath, Cavan, Cork, Laois, and Louth, all
but one of them through an increased active surveillance programme
initiated in July 2001.
More than 587 000 cattle destined for human consumption have been tested
under this scheme so far this year.

Farmer jailed for BSE cattle scam
---------------------------------
A farmer who bought 150 calves illegally imported from the North contrary
to BSE controls was yesterday sentenced to 4 months' jail and fined 10 000
Irish Pounds for his part in the scam. [This person], from Bellisle,
Clonlara, Co Clare, bought the calves for around 63 I.P. from a rogue
importer between October 2000 and January 2001 when they were worth double
that here, Limerick District Court was told.
In sentencing the defendant, Judge Tom O'Donnell said the accused man was
motivated by greed "pure and simple". The [36 year old]
father-of-2 pleaded guilty to 22 sample counts yesterday out of a total of
111, with the remaining 89 taken into account.
He was also charged with failing to keep a register as required by
regulations, being in possession of animals bearing confusing ear tags, and
recklessly including on an application form tag particulars which he knew
to be false.
Veterinary inspector Mary Burke told the court that in April last year at
the height of the foot and mouth scare, she received confidential
information from a reliable informant that [this individual] had up to 150
imported calves on his farm. The information was given to her after the
outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and people were worried over the
possibility that there might be other infected animals imported into the
jurisdiction.
From 1996 it became illegal to import animals from the North because of
the outbreak of BSE. "If a calf was imported and given a false identity,
our traceability system would be worthless," she added. "This is by far the
biggest in the state that we are aware of."

[Ireland was the first non-UK country to discover BSE in native cattle,
with its first cases recorded already in 1989. Since then, 1146 cases have
been reported. The recently observed increase -- from 246 cases in 2001 to
303 cases during 10.5 months in 2002 -- is cause for concern, certainly for
an exporting country and compared to the decrease observed in most other EU
countries (excluding Spain and the Netherlands). It might indicate
underreporting and probably significant illegal animal movements in
previous years, as demonstrated in the above report. - Mod.AS]
