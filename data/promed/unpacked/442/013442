After having a dish made with home-grown chicken, an inhabitant of
the Altay area has died and 2 others are in the hospital.
There was an emergency case in the Central Regional Hospital of
Blagoveshchensk region of the Altay Republic on 27 Jul 2006. The
details of the case have been communicated to IA Regnum by the Press
Service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Emergency
Situations of the Altay Republic.
In the early evening 3 patients were admitted to the hospital with
the diagnosis "acute poisoning of unknown origin." The victims were
from the village of Telmana: a 23-year-old male, a 24-year-old woman;
and a 16-year-old adolescent.
According to the victims, they ate a pilaw with home-grown chicken,
which had been seasoned with "salt." One of the patients died after 2
hours in hospital. Forensic experts have listed the diagnosis as
"Poisoning with a methemoglobin-forming agent."
The remains of [the dish] have been subjected to further tests.

[The most likely cause of poisoning is sodium nitrate/nitrite. There
was another group of poisonings in Kyrgyzstan in 1997 [and in 2005 --
see ProMED refs below]. The cause of the poisoning was pilaw [a rice
dish], which a chef seasoned with white powder that looked like
regular salt. After the investigation it became clear that the powder
was sodium nitrate. The case involved 51 people, of whom 2 died: the
chef and his assistant. The diagnosis was confirmed as "Poisoning
with a methemoglobin-forming agent." - Corresp.AP]
[Sodium nitrate has on a number of occasions been mistaken for table
salt. Clinical signs of ingestion may include gastroenteritis,
abdominal pains, dizziness, bloody diarrhea, convulsions, and
collapse. Purging and diuresis is expected. If the victim receives
small, repeated doses there may be headache and mental impairment.
Generally in the case of mistaking sodium nitrate for sodium
chloride, the dose may be larger for large meals typical of
celebrations. Rare cases of nitrates being converted to the more
toxic nitrites have been reported.
Sodium nitrate has been used in curing meat for centuries. Bacterial
action converts the nitrate to nitrite, which kills the organism
responsible for botulism poisoning. Generally sodium nitrite has
replaced sodium nitrate, except in slow-cured hams.
The following remarks are regarding nitrite and are from my fellow
moderator LL, copied from a previous posting:
Nitrite is added to certain foods to prevent the growth of the
spore-forming bacterium _Clostridium botulinum_, whose toxin causes
botulism, leading to paralysis and, potentially, death. The word
botulinum comes from the Latin word botulus, meaning sausage, which
was responsible for many deaths centuries ago before curing with
nitrite was used. In addition to serving as an antimicrobial, nitrite
is used to produce the characteristic flavor, texture, and pink color
of cured meats.
At significant blood levels, the nitrite's oxidation of the iron in
hemoglobin from the ferrous to the ferric state yields methemoglobin,
which does not carry oxygen and imparts a brown hue to the blood.
Symptoms of methemoglobinemia include headaches, fatigue, tachycardia
(fast heart rate), weakness and dizziness. As oxygenation of tissues
decreases to the point of becoming truly inadequate, dyspnea
(shortness of breath), acidosis, arrhythmias (irregular heart
rhythms), coma, convulsions, and even death may occur. - Mod.TG]
