The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration today [20 Dec
2011] declared the recent deaths of ringed seals in the Arctic and
Bering Strait regions of Alaska an unusual mortality event, triggering
a focused, expert investigation into the cause of these deaths.

Since mid-July [2011], more than 60 dead and 75 diseased seals, most
of them ringed seals, have been reported in Alaska, with reports
continuing to come in.

During their fall [2011] survey, scientists with the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service also identified diseased and dead walruses at the
annual mass haul-out at Point Lay.

A decision by the service on making an unusual mortality declaration
for Pacific walrus in Alaska is pending.

Seals and walruses suffering from this disease have skin sores,
usually on the hind flippers or face, and patchy hair loss. Some of
the diseased animals have exhibited labored breathing and appear
lethargic and do not flee from humans as they usually do.

Scientists have not yet identified a single cause for this disease,
though tests indicate a virus is not the cause.

Dr. Stephen Raverty, veterinary pathologist with the Provincial
Veterinary Diagnostic Lab in British Columbia, told reporters on a
conference call today [20 Dec 2011] that the lesions on these animals
are much more severe than the patchy hair loss usually seen.

"These appear to be ulcerated lesions with secondary infections," he
said. "Opportunistic yeast and fungi and bacteria have invaded."

But Dr. Raverty said scientists still have not determined the cause or
causes of these deaths. "Our analysis is not completed," he said. "It
could be an environmental factor or more than one disease."

"We have forwarded the sampled tissues to labs: bacteria, mycology,
virology," he said. "We are screening for 18 recognized pathogens, but
all the lab results have come back negative."

"We think defects in the skin are allowing pathogens to migrate into
the animals," Dr. Raverty said. "Bacteria are becoming blood borne and
localizing to the liver, causing white spots on the liver, hepatitis
and fluid in the lungs."

Necropsies have found abnormal growths in the brain. Some seals and
walruses have undersized lymph nodes, which may indicate compromised
immune systems.

Testing continues for a wide range of possible factors that may be
responsible for the animals' condition, including immune
system-related diseases, fungi, man-made and bio-toxins, radiation
exposure, contaminants, and stressors related to sea ice change.

Hunters continue to see numerous healthy animals, and despite
considerable contact with seals by hunters and field research
personnel throughout this event, no similar illnesses in humans have
been reported. Still, it is not known whether the disease can be
transmitted to humans, pets, or other animals.

Polar bears are one of the main predators on ringed seals, but
scientists have not observed any health issues in polar bears, said
Dr. Raphaela Stimmelmayr, a wildlife veterinarian and research
biologist with the North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife
Management in Alaska.

Walruses and ringed seals in Russia and ringed seals in Canada have
reportedly suffered similar symptoms. While it is not clear whether
the disease events are related, the timing and location of the disease
suggests the possibility of transmission between the populations or
shared exposure to an environmental cause.

Since early November [2011], federal agencies and partners have been
consulting with the Working Group on Marine Mammal Unusual Mortality
Events, a group of experts from scientific and academic institutions,
conservation organizations, and state and federal agencies, to
consider whether the seal and walrus deaths meet the criteria for an
unusual mortality event. Late last week [16 Dec 2011], the Working
Group recommended NOAA and the Fish and Wildlife Service declare an
unusual mortality event.

The collaborative investigation into these deaths has and will
continue to involve the North Slope Borough, numerous organizations,
local communities, tribal entities, and members of the Alaska Marine
Mammal Stranding Network, including the Alaska SeaLife Center, Alaska
Sea Grant Marine Advisory Program, and Alaska Department of Fish and
Game. These investigations may require months or even years of data
collection and analysis, said NOAA.

Native subsistence hunters are advised to use traditional and
customary safe handling practices, and the Alaska Division of Public
Health recommends fully cooking all meat and thoroughly washing hands
and equipment with a water-bleach solution.

Anyone who encounters a seal or walrus that looks sick or behaves
unusually should avoid approaching or making contact with the animal.

Sick or dead marine mammals should be reported to the following
agencies, based on where the animal is seen:

* North Slope area: North Slope Borough Department of Wildlife
Management: 907-852-0350 * Bering Strait region: Alaska Sea Grant
Marine Advisory Program: 1-800-478-2202 or 907-443-2397 * Elsewhere in
Alaska: NOAA Fisheries Alaska marine mammal stranding hotline:
1-877-925-7773.

NOAA's Alaska regional fisheries website has more in-depth information
about this disease outbreak in ringed seals and walruses. The agency
says any findings of public health significance will be immediately
released.

NOAA will work with local native organizations, including the Ice Seal
Committee and the Eskimo Walrus Commission, to ensure that information
is distributed to affected communities.

[Although the skin lesions and hair loss appear as a quite consistent
finding, a multi-factorial and/or environmental etiology is likely. An
ecosystem health problem behind this disease is very difficult to
confirm, but it is worth remarking that, apparently, the only affected
taxonomic group are pinnipeds.
