Trying to solve the mystery of the 200 000 missing salmon
-----------------------------------------------
Mike Mahovlich could tell something was wrong with last year's [2004] Lake
Washington sockeye-salmon run just by standing at the Ballard Locks. Salmon
carcasses floated belly-up when water rose in the Locks, which separate
Lake Washington from Puget Sound. Dying salmon lay gasping on rocks along
the brackish water between the Locks and the Sound. "In my 15 years, there
was nothing as bad as last year as far as just seeing dead bodies of
sockeye," said Mahovlich, a fish biologist for the Muckleshoot Tribe, which
helps manage the sockeye run. But he was even more startled by the final
picture that emerged late in the year: As many as 200 000 sockeye, roughly
half the run, had disappeared somewhere between the Locks and their
spawning grounds in streams beyond the lake.
The mystery of the missing sockeye has scientists puzzled and worried, as
they try to decipher the fate of a cherished run that passes through the
heart of Seattle. So far, scientists are focusing their suspicion on
abnormal water temperature. And they worry that climate change could make
it more than a freak occurrence.
Already, there are signs that this wasn't a one-time event. In the past 34
years, 3 of the 4 years with the biggest disparity in fish numbers between
the Locks and the spawning grounds have been since 2000. And recent
research shows Lake Washington has warmed over the past 3 decades, driven
in part by rising air temperatures that could be a symptom of global warming.
But for the salmon, 2004 was the worst by far. It caught the attention of
researchers and convinced them that the drop wasn't just a figment of
imprecise counting methods. "I'm afraid it's not one freak year," said Eric
Warner, another Muckleshoot fisheries biologist. "I think it's probably a
hint of things to come."
Good start goes bad
When the sockeye started passing through the Locks last June 2004, the
season was looking good. People hired to count salmon climbing the fish
ladder reported enough fish that a sockeye fishing season was launched.
Then, in August 2004, dead salmon began to turn up in larger numbers.
Concerned, the state tested some of the dead salmon for signs of disease
but found no indications of a major outbreak.
In October 2004, when the fish were expected to arrive in their spawning
streams, the magnitude of the problem emerged. In Bear Creek, where as many
as 40 000 sockeye spawned a generation earlier, just 1500 arrived. In the
Cedar River, where most of the sockeye usually return, scientists kept
waiting for a surge of fish but instead saw only a steady, low flow.
By winter, the fish disappearance, combined with hot weather the previous
summer and an absence of a disease outbreak, led researchers to suspect
high water temperatures in the Lake Washington Ship Canal. It's narrow and
shallow, and sockeye have to run it to reach the cool, deep waters of Lake
Washington.
Sunny, warm weather last June and July [2004] had driven water temperatures
unusually high. Ship-canal water hit 68 F on 21 Jun 2004, 2 weeks earlier
than ever recorded. On 18 Jul 2004, it reached 71.6 F. For salmon, water
temperature above 68 F is dangerous. It can stress them out, making them
more vulnerable to disease. At 77 F, water temperature can kill them outright.
Warm water was suspected in the disappearance last year [2004] of sockeye
in British Columbia. As many as 1.3 million sockeye failed to show up at
spawning grounds on the Fraser River, one of the most important commercial
salmon runs in the province. It was a catastrophe that led to government
inquiries and finger-pointing over tribal fishing rights.
Causing anxiety
The Lake Washington sockeye disappearance hasn't produced such controversy.
For example, no one has blamed problems on over-fishing. But it is causing
anxiety about the state of the sockeye, the city's largest salmon run.
Chinook salmon, which pass through the Locks mainly in August, didn't
appear to suffer the same effects as the sockeye, said Warner, the
Muckleshoot biologist. They may not be as temperature sensitive.
While the sockeye aren't native to Lake Washington -- they were introduced
in the 1930s -- the fish have cultural and economic importance.
The Muckleshoot, Tulalip and Suquamish tribes have rights to catch the
sockeye, which are centerpieces in ceremonies as well as a source of food
and income. For non-Indians, a good run draws flotillas of recreational
anglers to Lake Washington in July. Tourists flock to the Locks, partly to
watch sockeye salmon wriggle and splash their way past huge viewing
windows. Now tribal and state scientists are preparing studies to track the
sockeye and follow clues about what might be happening to them.
One study will tag salmon with sensors to measure the water temperatures
they are enduring. Another would use underwater radio receivers to
determine how many actually make it through the ship canal. Yet another is
aimed at getting a more accurate estimate of how many fish make it from the
Locks to the spawning grounds.
"There's just a lot of 'Maybe this is it,' and guesses," said Steve Foley,
the lead Lake Washington salmon biologist for the state Fish and Wildlife
Department. "We're looking this year [2005] to try to get some answers."
Checking the temperature
But water temperature remains the prime suspect. And some worry that it
could become worse. Evidence has linked rising air temperatures in the
Seattle area to increased surface-water temperatures in Lake Washington.
A 2004 study by University of Washington and King County researchers found
that average summer surface-water temperatures have risen by about 4 F over
a 35 year period, with air temperatures the strongest influence. Last
year's [2004] sockeye problems show "exactly why that study is relevant,"
said Michael Brett, a University of Washington scientist who co-wrote the
study.
And for fish scientists, the warming trends leave them wondering whether
what happened last year [2004] to the sockeye may become the norm. "If it's
a one-in-30-years event, then it's not very important. If it starts
happening with frequency, then it's a critical thing," said Jim Ames,
sockeye-program manager for the state Fish and Wildlife Department.

[Although the article is focused on water temperature, and there is mention
of disease testing, there is no mention of toxins. Has there been any
testing of the water other than temperature, or were there any signs of
toxins in the fish bodies? - Mod.TG]
