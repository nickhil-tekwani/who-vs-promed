Avian botulism is causing ducks and geese to get sick and die at Duck
Lake in City Park. Denver Parks and Recreation says the birds die off
at the park at about this time every year. What is different about
this year [2010] is that the lake is being renovated.

In February 2010, workers began to drain some of the water out for an
improvement project. The man-made lake had water quality problems,
according to officials. The project will re-contour the lake-bed once
all the water is drained and the bottom is dry.

In the meantime, the lower water levels mean higher concentrations of
whatever is in the water, making the birds sick.

"One of the reasons we have the issue of avian botulism is because of
the number of waterfowl in City Park. Birds, they come into the park;
they're fed; they have Kentucky blue grass to eat; they don't migrate
like they're supposed to, and so you have an increase in the number
of birds, and it all contributes to the health risk that we do see
with the waterfowl there," says Jill McGranahan with Parks and Recreation.

Avian botulism poses no threat to humans. "There's absolutely no
reason to avoid using City Park. It's perfectly safe," McGranahan said.
