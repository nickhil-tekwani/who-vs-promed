[According to OIE's archive, the total accumulated statistics since the start of the current BTV-8 event in France, 21 Aug 2015, are as follows:
Total outbreaks = 292 (Submitted)
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Destroyed / Slaughtered
Cattle / 52 165 / 408 / 3 / 0 / 0
Sheep / 2907 / 16 / 0 / 1 / 0
Sheep & goats (mixed flocks) / 161 / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0
Goats / - / 1 / 0 / 0 / 0

Most of the statistics from France during the recent winter and spring months presented old infections; the actual circulation of BTV-8 was minimal if not absent during the said period. The circulation was expected to rise during the recurring vector season, but so far this seems to be minimal.
