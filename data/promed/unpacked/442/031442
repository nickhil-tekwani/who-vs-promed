Health officials with the Government of the Canary Islands have reported a possible outbreak of ciguatera after finding 6 cases of food poisoning [that occurred] after consuming black medregal (amberjack) in La Victoria de Acentejo, according to an El Dia report (computer translated). Ciguatera is not unknown in the Canary Island[s], [which report] several cases annually [including] some 20 outbreaks in the past decade.

More than 400 species of fish, including barracuda, black grouper, blackfin snapper, cubera snapper, dog snapper, greater amberjack, hogfish, horse-eye jack, king mackerel, and yellowfin grouper, have been implicated in this food-borne illness that is relatively common in several areas of the world.

The toxin causing the illness is produced by marine algae and passed up through the food chain. These marine algae hang on to dead coral and seaweed. They are then eaten by herbivore fish that are subsequently eaten by predatory reef fish, which concentrates the toxin in its tissue. People get this food-borne toxin from eating these contaminated larger fish. The reef fish are more likely to get contaminated during storms and other turbulence.

After eating the affected fish (the fish does not get sick from the toxin and actually tastes good), [cases will find] in as little as a couple of hours symptoms may appear. Gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea, nausea and vomiting tend to appear early. Then a feeling of weakness and hypertension may occur, in addition to complaints of intense itching. Some mild to severe neurological symptoms are common with ciguatera; dizziness, impaired coordination, blurred vision and even coma may be seen in severe cases.

An unusual characteristic that is common in ciguatera is temperature reversal. This may be seen from 2 to 5 days after eating the fish. Hot objects seem cold and cold objects can give a shock-like sensation. There have been serious injuries because a person was unable to recognize extremely hot sensations. Other odd symptoms are food may taste metallic and teeth may seem painful or loose.

The gastrointestinal symptoms usually resolve in a couple days; however, neurological symptoms may last for months or years. Symptoms may come back after ingesting certain foods and drinks: alcohol, caffeine, nuts and fish.

There are no laboratory tests to diagnose this disease, and [diagnosis] is based on clinical symptoms and a history of eating an offending fish. Some studies have shown that IV mannitol is effective in providing relief and recovery if taken within the first 72 hours of intoxication. Other than that, most treatment is for the various symptoms the person may have.

So how can you prevent getting this potentially serious toxin? Prevention can be difficult since the toxin in the fish cannot be killed by cooking and there is no offensive odor or appearance to the fish. So the only way to truly try to prevent this intoxication is to avoid eating large reef fish or getting your fish through a reputable supplier.

[A recent open access review of ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) has been published in Marine Drugs (Friedman MA , Fernandez M, Backer LC, et al: An updated review of ciguatera fish poisoning: clinical, epidemiological, environmental, and public health management. Mar Drugs 2017;15:pii:E72. http://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/15/3/72/htm).

The description of the acute illness with the citations intact (the citations can be found at the URL above) has been extracted below:

"CFP is characterized by gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular symptoms. In addition, after the initial or acute illness, neuropsychological symptoms may be reported. Clinical features can vary depending on elapsed time since eating the toxic meal, and whether the geographic source of the implicated ﬁsh was the Caribbean Sea, Paciﬁc, or Indian Ocean [17,36,52-58]. Gastrointestinal symptoms and signs usually begin within 6-12 hours of ﬁsh consumption and resolve spontaneously within 1-4 days. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. The neurologic symptoms usually present within the first 2 days of illness. They often become prominent after the gastrointestinal symptoms (particularly in CFP events from Caribbean ﬁsh), although they may present concurrently with gastrointestinal symptoms (K Schrank, written communication, April 2016) [59]. The neurologic symptoms vary among patients and include paresthesias (that is, numbness or tingling) in the hands and feet or oral region, metallic taste, sensation of loose teeth, generalized pruritus (itching), myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), headache, and dizziness. A distinctive neurologic symptom is cold allodynia, sometimes referred to as 'hot-cold reversal,' an alteration of temperature perception in which touching cold surfaces produces a burning sensation or a dysesthesia (that is, unpleasant, abnormal sensation) [60]. One study revealed that intra-cutaneous injection of CTX in humans elicited this sensation [61]. Cold allodynia is considered pathognomonic of CFP, although not all patients report experiencing it and it can be seen with other human seafood poisoning syndromes (such as neurotoxic shellﬁsh poisoning). Less commonly, severe central nervous system symptoms, such as coma or hallucinations, have been reported [54,62,63]. Neuropsychological symptoms, which often become apparent in the days or weeks after the initial or acute illness, include subjectively reported cognitive complaints such as confusion, reduced memory, and difficulty concentrating [64-67], depression or irritability [64,65,68], and anxiety [65]. Fatigue or malaise have been reported and may be debilitating [6,62,69,70]. Cardiac symptoms and signs may manifest, generally in the early stage of the illness. When present, they usually occur in combination with gastrointestinal and/or neurologic signs and symptoms [71,72]. Cardiac signs often include hypotension and bradycardia which may necessitate emergency medical care." - Mod.LL
