The Islamic State may have used chemical agents in an attack against civilians and rival insurgents in northern Syria late last week [Fri 21 Aug 2015], according to local rebels and an international aid group.

The assault on [Fri 21 Aug 2015] in the city of Marea involved more than 50 shells and was centered on civilian areas, the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), a humanitarian group, reported.

After the attack, the group's field hospital received more than 50 patients, 23 of whom, including some children, showed symptoms of chemical exposure, including coughing, vomiting, wheezing, and severe itching. Some also had blisters associated with mustard gas, the society said in a statement.

The report was corroborated by local rebel forces, who claimed that shells had been fired from Isnibil, a village east of Marea that is controlled by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.

"At least half of the 50 mortar and artillery shells fired by ISIS contained poisonous mustard gas," said Hussein Nasir, a spokesman for a Syrian rebel group, the Shami Front.

He said that his group had consulted a general who defected from the Syrian Army and was familiar with chemical weapons. After hearing accounts of the attack and seeing videos and photographs of the shells, the general concluded that some of the shells contained mustard gas, Mr Nasir said.

This month [August 2015], the [US] Pentagon said the Islamic State was suspected of using chemical agents in an attack against Kurdish forces in northern Syria. American officials said they were also looking into reports of a mustard gas attack on Kurdish fighters in Makhmur, Iraq.

"The shells landed randomly on different parts of the city resulting in many injuries," Mr Nasir said of the attack on [Fri 21 Aug 2015]. "Some bad odor filled the air, and those who were exposed showed symptoms of suffocation, skin irritation, and swelling."

When the shells hit, opponents of the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad were commemorating the 2nd anniversary of a chemical weapons attack on a Damascus suburb carried out by the government.

A nurse at the field hospital run by the Syrian American Medical Society said he had noticed a strange odor on the clothes of the victims.

"We received a family in very bad condition -- 2 parents and a child," the nurse, said. "They had difficulty breathing, severe headaches, a running nose, skin irritation, and red teary eyes." He said that 5 more shells were fired on [Sat 22 Aug 2015].

One person was killed in the attack, but apparently by conventional ordnance, not chemical agents, the rebels said. The medical society said in a statement that there had been no deaths from chemical agents.

Marea links the much larger city of Aleppo to the Turkish border, and it is a crucial strategic prize for the Islamic State; many of its residents have fled the fighting.

The city has long been held by insurgents, who initially took up arms against Mr Assad's government but have also clashed with the Islamic State. Marea was one of the 1st strongholds of the rebel forces that were then made up of army defectors and townspeople.

[This article states chemical weapons MAY have been used. The rest of article defines affected individuals, smells from clothing, and clinical signs that may be associated with chemical weapons.

The article does state that there were children with symptoms consistent with chemical exposure. In the article, the Syrian American Medical Society states that the symptoms are consistent with those of mustard gas. However, the article does not mention who may have been responsible, nor does it provide conclusive proof of the chemical.

Mustard gas, or sulfur mustard (Cl-CH2CH2)2S, is a chemical agent that causes severe burning of the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. It can be absorbed into the body through inhalation, ingestion, or by coming into contact with the skin or eyes.

First used during World War I, the gas is effective at incapacitating its victims en masse. Sulfur mustard is generally colorless in its gaseous state, though it may have a faint yellow or green tint. It is most easily recognized by its trademark "mustardy" odor, though some compare its smell to that of garlic, horseradish, or sulfur.

The gas is a vesicant, or blister-agent, causing redness and itching of the skin resulting in yellow, pus-filled blisters. Because mustard gas strips away the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, and respiratory tract, victims may also experience irritation of the eyes, temporary blindness, runny nose, cough, shortness of breath, and sinus pain. The digestive tract is also affected, resulting in abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and vomiting.

Unlike chemical nerve agents such as organophosphates or sarin gas, which immediately incapacitate victims, mustard gas victims typically do not exhibit symptoms of poisoning until 12 to 24 hours after exposure. However, higher concentrations of the gas can cause symptoms to develop within 1-2 hours.

Exposure to mustard gas is usually not lethal and most victims recover from their symptoms within several weeks. Some, however, remain permanently disfigured as a result of chemical burns or are rendered permanently blind. Others develop chronic respiratory diseases or infections, which can be fatal. And because mustard gas damages the DNA in human cells, recovered victims are at greater risk for developing certain cancers. Pregnant women exposed to the gas have an increased risk of delivering a baby with birth defects or cancer.

If sulfur mustard is released into the air as a vapor, people can be exposed through skin contact, eye contact, or breathing. Sulfur mustard vapor can be carried long distances by wind.

If sulfur mustard is released into water, people can be exposed by drinking the contaminated water or getting it on their skin. People can be exposed to liquid sulfur mustard by eating it or getting it on their skin.

Sulfur mustard can last from 1 to 2 days in the environment under average weather conditions and from weeks to months under very cold conditions.

Sulfur mustard breaks down slowly in the body, so repeated exposure may have a cumulative effect. Adverse health effects caused by sulfur mustard depend on the quantity, duration, and route of exposure.

Sulfur mustard is a powerful irritant and blistering agent that damages the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract. Sulfur mustard damages DNA, a vital component of cells in the body, especially in the bone marrow. This causes decreased formation of blood cells (aplastic anemia) or decreased red or white blood cells and platelets (pancytopenia).

Sulfur mustard vapor is heavier than air, so it will settle in low-lying areas.

Exposure to sulfur mustard usually is not fatal. When sulfur mustard was used during World War I, it killed fewer than 5 percent of the people who were exposed and got medical care.

People may not know right away that they have been exposed, because sulfur mustard may not have a smell or have a smell that might not cause alarm.

Typically, signs and symptoms do not occur immediately. Depending on the severity of the exposure, symptoms may not occur for up to 24 hours. Some people are more sensitive to sulfur mustard than are other people, and may have signs and symptoms sooner.

Sulfur mustard can have the following effects on specific parts of the body:
Skin: redness and itching of the skin may occur 2 to 48 hours after exposure and may eventually change to yellow blistering of the skin.

Eyes: irritation, pain, swelling, and tearing may occur within 3 to 12 hours of a mild to moderate exposure. A severe exposure may cause signs and symptoms within 1 to 2 hours and may include the symptoms of a mild or moderate exposure plus light sensitivity, severe pain, or blindness lasting up to 10 days.

Respiratory tract: runny nose, sneezing, hoarseness, bloody nose, sinus pain, shortness of breath, and cough within 12 to 24 hours of a mild exposure and within 2 to 4 hours of a severe exposure.

Digestive tract: abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, nausea, and vomiting.

Bone marrow: decreased formation of blood cells (aplastic anemia) or decreased red or white blood cells and platelets (pancytopenia) leading to weakness, bleeding, and infections.

Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to sulfur mustard.
