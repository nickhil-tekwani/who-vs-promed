[The West Nile fever map cited above is accompanied, on the website, by the following comment of the Veterinary Services (in Hebrew):
"Owners in the affected areas are advised to have their horses vaccinated."

Clinical cases of West Nile fever have been reported periodically from Israel since the late 1950s. Initially from humans, later also from avians (domestic geese) and equines. The virus was demonstrated in migratory birds. During recent decades the disease reappears every summer. 46 human cases were reported earlier this year (2012; see ProMED-mail archive no 20121025.1364837). - Mod.AS
