[The 7 new confirmed and 2582 suspected cases (up from 2582 suspected cases in the report of week 22 (27 May - 2 Jun 2019), indicate that Lassa fever virus transmission is continuing. Nigeria should be leaving the period of the year when more cases usually occur, as illustrated in the graph in Fig. 3, but more cases are still occurring. There has been a peak in case numbers between weeks 1 and 11 (1 Jan-17 Mar 2019) over the past 3 years and probably will be the case again this year (2019). There are now 140 confirmed deaths, with an increase of 10 from the week 22 reporting period. Fortunately, there are no new healthcare workers infected during this reporting period, and the total number of infected healthcare workers remains at 18. This outbreak remains widespread so far in 2019, with confirmed cases occurring in 22 states and the number of affected LGAs increased one to 83.

Transmission of Lassa virus occurs when individuals are in contact with rodent reservoir hosts' excreta or are within healthcare facilities. It would be interesting to know whether the prevalence of Lassa fever virus has been increasing in populations of rodent hosts in areas where human cases are occurring.

[2] New cases Gombe state

https://guardian.ng/news/lassa-fever-gombe-records-5-confirmed-cases-one-death-in-7-months/


Gombe State recorded 5 confirmed cases of Lassa fever, with one death, from January [2019] to date, an official of the state Ministry of Health said on [Mon 29 Jul 2019].

Dr. Nuhu Ville, State Epidemiologist, Ministry of Health told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the cases were discovered from 39 samples subjected to laboratory test during the period under review. He said that upon discovery of the 5 cases and the death of one of them, the remaining 4 were subjected to thorough treatment and monitored, leading to their recovery and discharge from the hospital.

According to him the person who died among the confirmed cases came to the hospital in a critical condition. He said the hospital management had taken over his burial from his relations to avoid contamination of other people.

Ville said Lassa Fever was most contagious during burial, hence the need for professionals to handle it to ensure that no secondary infection from man-to-man occurred. "We have never had a case of secondary infection in Gombe and we will do everything possible to avert it," he said.

He called on the public to always report any case of fever which persisted 2 days after treatment commenced. "Report any case of fever which persists 2 days after commencement of treatment. If you report on time the infected person has 80% chance of survival," he said.

[The above report indicates that Gombe state has had 5 confirmed cases with 1 death. The Nigeria CDC does list Gombe state among the states with cases but does not give the case numbers not does it indicate that there has been 1 death in Gombe. Perhaps the death occurred after the 18 Jul 2019 Nigeria CDC was issued. - Mod.TY]
