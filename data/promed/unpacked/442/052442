Afghanistan polio: 1st case in Kabul since 2001
-----------------------------------------------
An Afghan girl has been diagnosed with polio in Kabul -- the capital's 1st case since the Taliban's fall in 2001. The health ministry ordered a vaccination campaign across the capital after the 3-year-old was diagnosed.

Polio remains endemic in Afghanistan, Pakistan and northern Nigeria, but has been almost wiped out around the world. In all 3 countries Islamic extremists have obstructed health workers, preventing polio eradication campaigns from taking place. Since the Afghan Taliban changed their policy, allowing vaccination in recent years, there has been a decline in cases in Afghanistan. The emergence of a new case in Kabul is worrying health officials. [For a graphic representation of confirmed polio cases in in Afghanistan by year, see the original source URL of this media report. - Mod.MPP]

It was discovered in a very poor community of Kuchis, formerly nomadic herdsmen, now settled on a hillside in the east of the capital. In response, health workers have tried to visit every home in the community. There is no running water or electricity, and some of the ex-nomads still live in tents, despite the cold of winter in Kabul. Once the workers have put drops into the mouths of infants they find, they mark their hands with a blue line, and write the date on the wall.

It seems rudimentary, but 10s of thousands of volunteers in campaigns like this across the country have succeeded in almost beating the disease.

Cross-border transmission
-------------------------
The girl who contracted the disease, was diagnosed after she became paralysed. Her father is a taxi driver who often goes to the frontier region with Pakistan, and has now taken her there for treatment. Her uncle, said that she complains: "I can't stand up. The other children are playing and I cannot."

The polio strain in the 2 countries is identical, and with 1.5 million children crossing the frontier every year, cross-border transmission is inevitable. Nearly all of the cases in Afghanistan last year [2013] were in regions close to the Pakistan border. Afghanistan has health workers at the border crossings, attempting to monitor all children who cross, and vaccinating those at risk. But many people do not cross at formal customs posts, instead using tracks across the mountains and deserts that line the porous frontier.

'Undermining efforts'
---------------------
The Taliban in Afghanistan remain a nationalist movement, who have been persuaded of the values of modern medicine. But the Pakistani Taliban are a far more ideological group, similar to Boko Haram in northern Nigeria, who are focused on global jihad, and unwilling to believe anything the west tells them. [Complicating matters, there have been a series of attacks against polio vaccination workers in Pakistan and Nigeria resulting in fatalities and areas that have not had vaccination services due to security threats against the vaccination workers. - Mod.MPP]

As well as killing health workers, the Pakistani Taliban have campaigned against vaccination, spreading the malicious rumour that it is a covert policy of sterilisation. Their opposition, along with continuing insecurity in some parts of Afghanistan, could prevent continuing progress towards global eradication of the disease. Afghan Health Minister Soraya Dalil said the continuing opposition of the Pakistani Taliban was a threat, "undermining efforts" to eradicate polio in Afghanistan. After the initial local vaccination campaign, routine campaigns would continue, she said, to keep up the pressure, and ensure that this is an isolated case and not a new outbreak.

"This new case in Kabul tells us that the effort on polio eradication is not over yet, and we have to accelerate the effort to make sure that every child, no matter where they are, receive polio drops."

Data in WHO as of 12 Feb 2013 for 2013 data and 11 Feb 2014 for 2014 data.

Highlights of the week
----------------------
- Celebrating 3 years polio-free in India: on [11 Feb 2014], dignitaries from around the world came together at a celebratory event in Delhi. The President of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, was joined in the celebrations by Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, Union Health and Family Welfare Minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, Chairperson of the National Advisory Council Sonia Gandhi, Leader of the Opposition Shushma Swaraj, WHO Director-General Dr Margaret Chan, Rotary International President Ron D Burton and other high-level representatives. The Regional Certification Commission (RCC) for the Southeast Asia Region is expected to convene at end-March [2014] and review data from the entire Region, to determine if it will be officially certified as polio-free.

- In Afghanistan, an immunization response is ongoing to last week's reported case in Kabul. It was the 1st case in the province since 2002, and is linked to transmission in neighbouring Pakistan. Afghanistan continues to make strong progress towards polio eradication. This latest case in Kabul underscores the ongoing risk polio continues to pose to children everywhere.

Afghanistan
- One new wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) case was reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases remains 14 for 2013, but is now 2 for 2014. The most recent WPV1 case had onset of paralysis on [15 Jan 2014] from Badakhstan province, Northern Region.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) using bivalent OPV were completed on [9-11 Feb 2014] in selected southern districts. Further SNIDs are planned to cover larger areas in the eastern and southern parts of the country in [23-25 Feb 2014], followed by national immunization days (NIDs) on [23-25 Mar 2014].

Nigeria
- No new WPV cases were reported this week. The total number of WPV cases for Nigeria 2013 remains 53 (all WPV1). The most recent WPV1 case in the country had onset of paralysis on [15 Dec 2013] and was reported from Damboa, Borno.
- One new cVDPV2 case was reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 is now 4. The most recent cVDPV case had onset of paralysis on [24 Dec 2013] (from Maiduguri, Borno).
- An appropriate response to this most recent cVDPV2 case in Borno is now being planned. The cVDPV2 case is linked to previous transmission in Chad from 2013.
- The persisting transmission of 2 separate strains of cVDPV2 (from AFP cases and from the environment) in northern Nigeria and in north-West Pakistan is of concern to the GPEI since the 'withdrawal' of type 2 OPV vaccine (the 'tOPV to bOPV switch'), planned for early 2016, will not be possible unless all persistent cVDPV2 transmission has been stopped.
- Of the country's 53 WPV1 cases in 2013, only 6 were reported since September [2013], traditionally the 'high season' for polio transmission. Four of these are from Kano.
- SNIDs were conducted on [25-28 Jan 2014]. NIDs are planned for March [2014].

Pakistan
- Two new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week, both from North Waziristan in FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] (with onset of paralysis on [17 and 25 Jan 2014]). The total number of cases for 2013 remains 93. The total number of cases in 2014 is now 9. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [25 Jan 2014] (WPV1 from North Waziristan).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 45, and one for 2014. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [3 Jan 2014] (from North Waziristan).
- North Waziristan is the district with the largest number of children being paralyzed by poliovirus in the world (both wild- and VDPV2). Immunization activities have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012. It is critical that children in all areas are vaccinated and protected from poliovirus. Immunizations in neighbouring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and prevent further spread of this outbreak.
- The densely populated Peshawar valley is considered to be the main 'engine' of poliovirus transmission, alongside North Waziristan, due to large-scale population movements through Peshawar from across this region, and into other areas of Pakistan. The quality of operations must be urgently improved in Peshawar, and immunizations resumed in North Waziristan.
- However, at the same time, concerning trends have been noted in greater Karachi, Sindh and in Quetta, Balochistan. Environmental positives isolates from every major city of Punjab confirm widespread virus circulation.
- In Quetta, genetic sequencing of a positive environmental sample collected on [28 Dec 2013] indicates that it is linked to virus last detected in Afghanistan in July 2012, suggesting undetected circulation. Subnational analyses of surveillance sensitivity and immunity profiles are ongoing in both countries to ascertain more clarity. This further underscores the risk ongoing transmission anywhere, including low-level transmission, poses to the polio eradication efforts of both countries.

Central Africa
- In Cameroon, no new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent case in Cameroon had onset of paralysis on [30 Oct 2013] (WPV1 from Ouest).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week in Cameroon. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [12 Aug 2013] (from Kolfata, Extreme-Nord).
- NIDs were conducted in Cameroon [16-19 Jan 2014] and again [6-10 Feb 2014]. Further campaigns are planned for end-February [2014].
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac). No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
- NIDs were conducted in Chad from [22-24 Nov 2013]. Further NIDs are planned for late February [2014]. These activities will be critical, in particular given the confirmation of a new cVDPV2 in neighbouring Borno, Nigeria, linked to transmission of this virus in Chad in 2013 (see Nigeria section for more).

Horn of Africa
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases in the Horn of Africa remains 213 (190 from Somalia, 14 from Kenya and 9 from Ethiopia). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [20 Dec 2013] (from Bari, Somalia).
- The Horn of Africa Technical Advisory Group (TAG) convened last week in Nairobi, Kenya, to evaluate impact of current outbreak response activities. The TAG underscored that the initial response to the outbreak was appropriate, however expressed grave concern that gaps in SIA quality and surveillance remained in key infected areas of the region. Consequently, the group concluded there is a serious risk of the outbreak continuing and of further spread both within and beyond countries of the Horn of Africa. The group recommended that infected countries should focus efforts on high-risk and infected areas, by conducting high-quality SIAs no more than 4 weeks apart.
- An assessment of outbreak response activities in Ethiopia indicates significant ongoing vaccination coverage gaps in key areas, notably in parts of Somali region of the country. All efforts must be made to fill these vaccination coverage gaps as urgently as possible, which are threatening the regional outbreak response efforts.

Israel and West Bank and Gaza
- WPV1-positive samples have been detected by environmental surveillance in Israel since February 2013 and continue to be detected in 2014 (12 samples collected in 2014, the most recent on [26 Jan 2014]).
- Since 2005, only inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been used for routine childhood immunization in Israel. To interrupt WPV1 transmission, a nationwide supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent OPV targeting children less than 10 years of age was conducted from August to October [2013].
- Following a consultation with the country's immunization advisory group, the Israeli Ministry of Health has decided to re-introduce OPV into the national immunization schedule.
- Positive environmental samples have also been detected in West Bank and Gaza Strip, the most recent positive sample was collected on [20 Aug 2013].
- SIAs in West Bank and Gaza Strip were conducted [8-15 Dec 2013] and [8-15 Jan 2014].

Middle East
- In Syria, no new cases were reported in the past week. The total number of laboratory-confirmed WPV1 cases remains 23. The most recent case had onset of paralysis on [17 Dec 2013] and was reported from Mara, Edleb governorate.
- Additionally, there are 13 cases confirmed from contested areas but not yet reflected in official figures.
- In the Middle East, a comprehensive outbreak response continues to be implemented across the region. The most recent SIAs in Syria were held in early January [2014] and early February [2014]. Initial reporting indicates that over 3 million children were reached during the January [2014] SIA, with OPV reaching most if not all districts, and coverage attaining more than 85 percent in all but 3 governorates. Coverage data from the February [2014] activity is currently being compiled and analysed.
- WHO and UNICEF are committed to working with all organizations and agencies providing humanitarian assistance to Syrians affected by the conflict. This includes vaccination of all children no matter where they are, whether in government or contested areas, or outside Syria.
- The WHO/UNICEF Strategic Plan for Polio Outbreak Response in the Middle East outlines the action plan for Syria and neighbouring countries in response to the circulation of wild poliovirus following importation. The objective is to stop the outbreak in Syria by the end of March 2014 and prevent any further international spread.

West Africa
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was due to WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week from Niger. The country has reported a single case of cVDPV2 in 2013, with onset of paralysis on [11 Jul 2013]. Genetic sequencing has shown that the virus is related to that seen in Cameroon, Chad and Nigeria (Borno).
- National campaigns were conducted in West Africa [22-25 Nov 2013]. Further national campaigns are planned for March [2014] (in Niger) and April and May [2014] (multi-country).

[On a positive note, a nice occurrence is that India is now celebrating 3 years since the last confirmation of a case of WPV associated polio in the country. The certification of India as a polio-free country is a testimony to the efforts and strides made as part of the polio eradication initiative efforts.

From the above reports it is clear that continuing polio circulation in Pakistan remains a significant threat to neighboring countries, as well as distant countries. As a reminder, the WPV associated with the outbreak in Syria, as well as the WPV being isolated in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza is genetically related to WPV currently circulating in Pakistan. It is also apparent that there is continued circulation of the wild poliovirus (WPV) "under the radarscope" in areas, as seen by the findings in Balochistan, Pakistan, where environmental sampling identified a WPV that had last been known to be circulating in Afghanistan in July 2012.

In Nigeria, where it appears as though there is a real decrease in the numbers of confirmed cases of WPV associated disease, the continued identification of disease associated with circulating vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) highlights the continued presence of a susceptible population through which WPV could also continue to circulate. The outbreak of WPV associated disease in the Horn of Africa last year (2013) was associated with a WPV genetically similar to one known to be circulating in West Africa.

Another cause for concern is the continued circulation of the vaccine derived poliovirus (cVDPV) -- a sign that pockets of low vaccination coverage continue to exist, even in the face of repeated vaccination activities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Africa. As is mentioned above, the persistent circulation of cVDPV2, will impede the plan to eliminate the type 2 poliovirus from OPV vaccine -- a double-edged sword here -- with WPV2 last identified in 1999, yet the overwhelming majority of cVDPV isolates being type 2 vaccine virus. Since 2000, there have been 79 cases of paralytic disease associated with cVDPV1, 13 cases associated with cVDPV3 and 624 cases associated with cVDPV2 (see http://www.polioeradication.org/Dataandmonitoring/Poliothisweek/Circulatingvaccinederivedpoliovirus.aspx for tables showing the number of cVDPVs isolated by year, country and vaccine type, and a map showing their locations).

The mention that there have been an additional 13 cases of WPV confirmed in contested areas of Syria that are not reflected in the official reports as yet leads one to wonder if transmission of the WPV has been interrupted. Information on the most recent date of onset of disease in this group of cases would be helpful to address this question.
