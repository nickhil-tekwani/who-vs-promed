-------------------------------------------------------------
"[The genus _Ebolavirus_ was discovered in 1976...]"

One cannot discover a genus (or any taxon). It can only be established, and it was not established until the mid-1990s.

First, the genus _Ebolavirus_ does include 5 species, but the species are called _Bundibugyo ebolavirus_, _Reston ebolavirus_, _Sudan ebolavirus_, _Tai Forest ebolavirus_ [formerly _Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus_] and _Zaire ebolavirus_ [all italicized]. Each species has currently a single member. These members, the viruses, are called Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Reston virus (RESTV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Tai Forest virus (TAFV), and Ebola virus (not Zaire virus!) (EBOV). Species cannot infect you, they cannot be centrifuged, they cannot be discovered, and they cannot spread. Viruses on the other hand can do all those things.

Second, virus names should never be binomials (and rarely are), only species names should be. Hence, for a virus called "Reston virus," an abbreviation "REBOV" would not make sense; and species names are not to be abbreviated (Reston virus is a member of the species _Reston ebolavirus_; and people really need to begin to understand the difference).

It is deliberate to lose the connection to EBOV -- because RESTV, TAFV, etc. are different viruses, albeit classified in the same genus. RESTV, EBOV, and SUDV are ebolaviruses. If the ProMED report would say "Reston virus found in Philippines" and then the text state that RESTV is distantly related to EBOV and SUDV, then the panic meter would be much less than it will be now after "EBOV" has been found in the Philippines, while we still talk about the big EBOV disease outbreak in Western Africa.

So your comment in ProMED-mail posting 20150907.3629141 should have read:
"[The genus _Ebolavirus_ so far has 5 members, namely Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus (SUDV), Tai Forest virus (TAFV), Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), and Reston virus (RESTV). RESTV is the only one of those not associated with disease in humans, but it can cause illness in non-human primates and swine. These are the accepted abbreviations -- see Kuhn et al. (2010) http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00705-010-0814-x.]"

Hope this helps a bit?

[Jens, I apologize for the errors, including miscopying part of the abstract of your important paper. Thank you for sending this clear explanation.

The text emphasizes that species are not viruses. Therefore think dengue virus, yellow fever virus, any other virus you can think of -- none of them are ever italicized -- but binomial names of virus species must be italicized just like names of mosquito species. The other point is that although Reston virus is an ebolavirus, it is no closer to being Ebola virus than yellow fever virus is to Entebbe bat virus, although both of the latter viruses belong to the same flavivirus genus. - Mod.JW
