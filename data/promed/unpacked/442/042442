Potato wart disease of potato caused by _Synchytrium endobioticum_ (EPPO A2
quarantine pest) was first found in the Netherlands around 1914, and
gradually spread in potato-growing regions until the Second World War. In
the early 1950s, the disease became such a problem that in the
north-eastern part, potato cultivars susceptible to pathotype 1 were
forbidden and further phytosanitary measures were taken. These
phytosanitary measures were successful until 1973 when pathotype 2 was
detected for the first time. In 1991, pathotype 1 was detected in the
south-eastern part of the country. So far, only pathotypes 1 and 2 have
been found in the Netherlands. At present, results of intensive surveys
have showed that _S. endobioticum_ occurs in two areas. Twenty-four
infected fields (pathotype 2 only) were found in the north-eastern part
(province of Drenthe), and 32 infected fields (pathotype 1 only) were found
in the south-eastern part (province of Limburg). Strict phytosanitary measures
are being applied, in particular to prevent any further spread.

[Potato wart disease is characterized by galls, resembling warts, which
enlarge on the potato plant and tubers. Galls appear on all underground
parts except the roots. Buds on stems, stolons, and tubers are the centers
of infection which results in abnormal growth leading to production of
warts. Warts are subject to decay. Entire tubers may be entirely replaced
by the warty proliferation. As of October 1998 the disease is reported to
be present in Asia (Bhutan, China, India, Lebanon, Nepal), Africa (Algeria,
South Africa, Tunisia), Europe (all countries except Portugal where it was
eradicated), North America (the province of Newfoundland in Canada, and
Mexico), Oceania (South Island of New Zealand) and South America
(Bolivia, Chile, Falkland Islands, Peru, Uruguay). Strict phytosanitary
methods are required for prevention of spread to clean areas. -Mod. DH]
