A local doctor is warning of a growing number of cases involving a relatively new bacterial infection in the area that is caused by ticks.

It's called anaplasmosis and infectious disease specialist Dr John Love of the Butler Health System says it's a tricky diagnosis because it resembles illnesses like Lyme disease and COVID.

"Honestly, people who get anaplasmosis feel acutely ill. They feel like they have the flu, or they may feel like they have COVID, which makes things really difficult right now," Love said. "So, the leading symptoms are fever, which can be very high like [102 or 103 deg F/38.8 or 39.4 deg C], headaches, muscle aches, and maybe even nausea."

Love says while the number of cases isn't extraordinarily high, it's becoming more prevalent. "In 2019 [the Department of Health] had zero cases of anaplasmosis diagnosed in Butler County. In 2020 we had 7 cases. To date, through Butler Memorial's lab alone, we've had 18 already this year [2021]," Love said. Love says he's working to inform personal care physicians of this growing trend so they know what to look for in sick patients.

[Butler is a city with a population of 13 757 residents, located 35 miles (56.3 km) north of Pittsburgh; Butler is the county seat of Butler County (population a183 862) in western Pennsylvania, United States (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_County,_Pennsylvania). A map showing the location of Butler can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Butler,+PA.

An increased incidence of anaplasmosis can either be due to a true increase in the number of cases, or to better recognition and reporting of the disease.

_Anaplasma phagocytophilum_, the causative agent of anaplasmosis (also known as human granulocytic anaplasmosis or HGA), is transmitted to humans in wooded areas of the northeastern United States by the same tick (_Ixodes scapularis_) that transmits _Borrelia burgdorferi_, the causative agent of Lyme disease; _Babesia microti_, the causative agent of babesiosis; _Borrelia miyamotoi_, the causative agent of a form of relapsing fever; and Powassan virus, the causative agent of encephalitis. Patients may be concurrently infected by more than one of these pathogens at the same time.

Typically, the nymph stage of the tick, which is about the size of a poppy seed, transmits these diseases. For a picture of a nymph, see http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/babesiosis/.

Some individuals infected with _A. phagocytophilum_ do not become ill or experience only very mild symptoms and do not seek medical treatment. The symptoms tend to be most severe in aged or immunosuppressed people. In infected persons who are symptomatic with anaplasmosis, illness begins 5-21 days after a bite from an infected tick, with sudden onset of fever, headache, malaise, and myalgia, often accompanied by thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated liver transaminases. Approximately 5 to 7 percent of patients require intensive care, with prolonged fever, shock, confusion, seizures, pneumonitis, renal failure, and hemorrhages, and the illness can uncommonly be fatal.

Because _A. phagocytophilum_ are found in the blood stream of infected people, infected blood can serve as a vehicle for person-to-person transmission (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. _A. phagocytophilum_ transmitted through blood transfusion -- Minnesota, 2007. MMWR 2008; 57(42): 1145-8. October 2008 [date cited]; http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5742a1.htm).

Morulae (microcolonies of _Anaplasma_) can be seen in the cytoplasm of granulocytes during examination of blood smears in some patients. The diagnosis can be confirmed by detection of _Anaplasma_ DNA by PCR of whole blood during the 1st week of illness or demonstration of a 4-fold rise in IgG antibody titer in acute and convalescent serum (https://www.cdc.gov/anaplasmosis/healthcare-providers/clinical-lab-diagnosis.html).

Treatment with doxycycline 100 mg twice daily orally or intravenously for all symptomatic patients suspected of having anaplasmosis is recommended for a minimal total course of 10 days. This treatment regimen should be adequate therapy for patients with anaplasmosis alone and for patients who are co-infected with Lyme disease, but will not be effective therapy alone for patients who are co-infected with _B. microti_. Failure to improve within 48 hours of initiation of doxycycline therapy should raise concern that the patient does not have anaplasmosis or has a coinfection that is not responsive to doxycycline such as babesiosis (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7758915/).- Mod.ML
