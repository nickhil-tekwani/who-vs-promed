Chikungunya Virus Sequences - Free Access Online
-----------------------------------------------
As of Tue 23 May 2006, we (the editors of PLoS Medicine) would like to draw
your attention to a research article published online in PLOS Medicine
entitled "Genome Microevolution of Chikungunya Viruses Causing the Indian
Ocean Outbreak" by Sylvain Brisse (Institut Pasteur) and 22 colleagues.
Please feel free to read, share, print, and use this article in anyway you
wish, all at no charge thanks to open access publishing, accessible at
<http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=getdocument&doi=10%2E1371%2Fjournal%2Epmed%2E0030263>.
The Study
---------
Since late 2004, a large outbreak of chikungunya fever has been taking
place in the Indian Ocean. For example, on the island of Reunion,
approximately 1/3rd of the total population of 770 000 were reportedly
infected by April 2006. Sylvain Brisse and 22 colleagues report the 1st
molecular analysis of the chikungunya viruses involved in the outbreak. The
complete genome sequence of viral isolates from 6 patients and partial
sequences of isolates from 121 patients at different stages and locations
of the outbreak reveal unique and evolving genetic features.
The authors report the nearly complete genome sequence of 6 selected viral
isolates (isolated from 5 sera and one cerebrospinal fluid), along with
partial sequences of glycoprotein E1 from a total of 127 patients from
Reunion, Seychelles, Mauritius, Madagascar, and Mayotte islands. Our
results indicate that the outbreak was initiated by a strain related to
East-African isolates, from which viral variants have evolved following a
traceable microevolution history. Unique molecular features of the outbreak
isolates were identified. Notably, in the region coding for the
non-structural proteins, 10 amino acid changes were found, 4 of which were
located in alphavirus-conserved positions of nsP2 (which contains helicase,
protease, and RNA triphosphatase activities) and of the polymerase nsP4.
The sole isolate obtained from the cerebrospinal fluid showed unique
changes in nsP1 (T301I), nsP2 (Y642N), and nsP3 (E460 deletion), not
obtained from isolates from sera. In the structural proteins region, 2
noteworthy changes (A226V and D284E) were observed in the membrane fusion
glycoprotein E1. Homology 3D modeling allowed mapping of these 2 changes to
regions that are important for membrane fusion and virion assembly. Change
E1-A226V was absent in the initial strains but was observed in >90 percent
of subsequent viral sequences from Reunion, denoting evolutionary success
possibly due to adaptation to the mosquito vector.
The authors conclude that unique molecular features of the analyzed Indian
Ocean isolates of chikungunya virus demonstrate their high evolutionary
potential and suggest possible clues for understanding the atypical
magnitude and virulence of this outbreak.
