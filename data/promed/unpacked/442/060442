Pentagon Shifts Anthrax Vaccine to Civilian Uses
---------------------------------------
The Bush administration announced a new anthrax vaccination policy today,
including plans to continue vaccinating some military personnel and to
stockpile for civilian use a large part of all the anthrax vaccine being
produced for the Pentagon.
Under the new policy, which reverses an earlier plan to vaccinate all
military personnel, the Pentagon intends in the next 2 weeks to begin
vaccinating those who are expected to spend at least 15 days a year in
regions where the threat of anthrax attack is considered high. That would
include Iraq and other Persian Gulf countries, the Korean peninsula and
possibly Afghanistan, officials said.
But at least a third of the vaccine to be produced will be stored by the
Department of Health and Human Services in secret warehouses scattered
around the country for use after a domestic anthrax attack, administration
officials said. In the event of such an attack, most of those doses would
probably be given to police officers, firefighters, rescue squads and others
required to respond, as well as to people who lived or worked in areas
exposed to the anthrax bacteria, administration officials said.
The new policy reflects in part a mounting concern within the Bush
administration and among intelligence officials about reports that Iraq has
well over 2650 gallons of liquid anthrax, and could be making more in more
than half a dozen laboratories.
The Iraqi anthrax could be used in biological weapon attacks in the region,
posing a threat to military personnel, intelligence officials said. But some
administration officials said they could not rule out such attacks in the
United States.
The officials said that this conclusion was based on recent assessments by
United States intelligence officials, who are constantly monitoring Iraq's
ability to produce chemical, biological and nuclear materials, and by United
Nations weapons inspectors, who have also been re-examining their estimates
of Iraqi stockpiles of unconventional weapons based on information dating
from as early as 1991, foreign and American officials said.
The Pentagon's review of its vaccination policy has taken months, and
concern about whether the administration was perceived to be moving fast
enough to protect soldiers was a factor in the announcement of a new policy
today. The Pentagon said it would immediately begin vaccinating some
soldiers at greatest risk and would significantly expand stockpiles of the
vaccine for civilian use.
The new vaccination policy reflects a reversal of one instituted in 1997 by
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen. That plan required that all 2.4
million active and reserve military personnel be inoculated by 2003. The
Pentagon declined to say how many people it expects to vaccinate in the
coming year.
"This is a shift from our earlier policy, which was to vaccinate everyone,"
Dr. William Winkenwerder Jr., the assistant secretary of defense for health
affairs, told reporters today. "This is a policy that's focused on those in
higher-threat areas."
The Pentagon acknowledged in interviews this week that only 69 000 soldiers
had received the full 6-shot anthrax vaccine series.
During the Persian Gulf war, intelligence officials argued that Saddam
Hussein would not use his stockpile of anthrax and other chemicals unless he
and his regime were clearly threatened. The administration's recent
statements about the need for "regime change" in Iraq, its inclusion of
Baghdad in the "axis of evil," and President Bush's articulation of a
pre-emption doctrine that would justify American military action against any
hostile nation that makes unconventional weapons, however, have increased
the threat that Hussein might use his large arsenal, some officials say.
United States military planners and United Nations weapons inspectors have
been re-examining their estimates about the amount of anthrax that Iraq may
have stockpiled, and the amount that Mr. Hussein has been able to make since
he expelled inspectors 3 years ago. A recent analysis by the United Nations
inspectors says there is compelling evidence that Iraq has large stocks of
liquid anthrax that could be used at any time.
The new policy clearly reflects the thinking that civilians in this country
are as susceptible to anthrax attacks as soldiers in combat zones, as was
demonstrated by the death of 5 people last year from anthrax spores sent
through the mail. But it also underscores the problem the government has had
in producing enough vaccine for the entire military. In December 1999, the
Food and Drug Administration ordered the lone manufacturer of anthrax
vaccine in the United States, the BioPort Corporation of Lansing, Mich., to
halt
production after inspectors found dozens of violations in safety,
consistency, record-keeping and sterility at its Michigan plant. The agency
authorized BioPort to resume production again in January [2002].
Some administration officials have also raised questions about whether
BioPort could produce enough vaccine in the coming year to support a major
military operation, such as an invasion of Iraq. Some senior military
planners have argued that ousting Saddam Hussein would require 200 000
troops. BioPort officials asserted today that they could produce enough
doses to vaccinate the entire military, and they expressed dismay at
Pentagon suggestions that the new policy was being driven by supply
constraints.
"We can make millions on an annual basis," said Robert Kramer, the company
president. "We were disappointed to hear at the press conference that the
vaccination schedule is supply driven, that policy was being driven by
supply. We're ready, willing and able to partner with anyone to produce
enough doses under our license." [Meaning they canÂ´t do it all by
themselves. - Mod.JW]
Mr. Kramer said, and administration officials confirmed, that despite the
Pentagon announcement today, there was not yet a specific agreement on how
much vaccine Bioport would sell the government and at what price. Under a
contract reached 3 years ago, the Pentagon pays $10.64 a dose, and both
Pentagon and company officials said the price could rise significantly,
perhaps doubling.
Pentagon officials have declined to say how much vaccine BioPort is capable
of producing, but administration officials said the government wanted to buy
about 3 million doses in the next 3 years. Administration officials said the
military would receive about a third of the vaccine, the civilian stockpile
about a third and the last third would go to other government agencies, like
the State Department, that have employees who could be in danger.
Other officials say the new policy reflects a desire to provide sufficient
vaccine for civilians. "At this point in time we do not have a large enough
stockpile to pre-vaccinate, so the stockpile will be reserved for post
exposure," said Jerome M. Hauer, acting assistant secretary for emergency
preparedness at the Department of Health and Human Services. "The stockpile
for civilians will be used for post-exposure vaccination and as the
stockpile grows we will re-evaluate our policy as to whether certain first
responders should be pre-vaccinated."
Full inoculation against anthrax requires a regimen of 6 shots administered
over 18 months, followed by annual booster shots. Pentagon officials say a
person must receive at least 3 shots to gain at least partial protection.
The Pentagon estimates that about 525 000 soldiers have received at least
one anthrax vaccination over the last 4 years, but the vast majority have
not received all 6 shots.
The Pentagon's mandatory anthrax vaccination program has been slowed by
opposition from a small but vocal group of soldiers who contend the vaccine
has potentially dangerous side effects. Since the program began in 1998,
more than 450 people in the military have been disciplined for refusing to
be vaccinated [out of 525 000 vaccinated. - Mod.JW].
The analysis of Iraq's liquid anthrax stockpile, a summary of which has
circulated in recent weeks among senior United Nations officials and
selected Western governments, including the United States, says there must
now be a "presumption" that Baghdad concealed at least 10 000 liters, or 2
650 gallons, of anthrax after the 1991 Persian Gulf war, officials said.
The 7-page report, an analysis of evidence that was gathered for a 1991 CIA
report on Iraqi biological weapons, the officials said, builds a
circumstantial case that the anthrax remains potent and available.
