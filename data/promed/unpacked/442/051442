[There was no map in the OIE communication. - Mod.MHJ]
[The precise interpretation of the change "1=>3" in the Incidence report above is unclear, hence our "?". According to the OIE (pers. comm. to Mod. CRM), this notation is simply a qualitative interpretation made by the country involved. At the very least we can infer that there are more cases occurring than previously noted. - Ed. LXL]
