Question: If an animal has tested negative to Sellars, negative to SAT, and
negative to mouse inoculation, can that animal still be positive for Rabies?
Have there been any cases where Rabies was present even though the animal
was shown to be negative for these three tests?

Sellers is a histochemical staining method for visualization of Negri
bodies. From various authors, about 20 to 40% rabid brains do no show
positive staining! I would recommand laboratories not to use this method.
The reason is the following:
Suppose the dog is negative and the test is negative; one would still
question the fact that maybe the brain is positive and the staining is
negative, not speaking of possible non-specific inclusions having the same
look as Negri bodies.
Suppose the animal is rabid and the Sellers is positive. Everything is all
right!
Suppose the animal is rabid and the Sellers is negative : who would take
the chance to interrupt a series of vaccination for post-exposure treatment
knowing the limits of Sellers reliability in a highly endemic rabies area?
If so, what is the final use of Sellers staining? If it is not for
interruption of a useless rabies treatment because the biting animal was
not rabid?
For direct rabies diagnosis, 3 methods - direct fluorescence, mouse
inoculation and neuroblastoma cell culture isolation are very reliable. We
have experienced these methods for years and would interrupt a series of
rabies vaccine shots if 2 methods give the same results.
In our laboratory, we also perform the ELISA test, but do not use mouse
inoculation any more since it matches very accurately, results given by
cell culture isolation.
Trying to answer "Have there been any cases where Rabies was present even
though the animal was shown to be negative for these three tests?" I would
say definitively yes for the Sellers method. For the two others, I would
say that there are always possibilities to have negative laboratory results
if :
1/ the virus has not reached the brain
2/ the sample was contaminated
3/ sampling was performed several weeks ago !
4/ inadequate fluorescent equipment
5/ lack of standardized reagents
6/ lack of experience in laboratories not performing routinely
7/ rhabdovirus not belonging to serotype 1
Finally, I would say that in case all the possible flaws are eliminated, I
would believe in a negative laboratory test.
[Thanks very much for the thoughtful answer, Henri. The positive and
negative predictive values, sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic tests
should always be considered when interpreting test results, particularly
when the outcome from false negative or false positive results may be dire.
