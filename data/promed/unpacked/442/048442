Man eats poisoned sausage intended for rabid dogs
-------------------------------------------------
A man was taken to hospital this week [18-24 Sep 2009] after eating a
spicy Balinese-style pork sausage that had been covered in poison to
kill dogs suspected of having rabies.

The victim was found unconscious at his home in Banjar Dukuh, Penebei.
He was rushed to Tabanan Hospital, where doctors treated him. He then
insisted on going home.

There have been 3 human deaths from rabies in Tabanan regency
recently, which haVE sparked community panic and a rush for
anti-rabies vaccinations by people bitten by dogs.

Comment:
--------
I have now received 31 reports from 10 different sources over the past
9 months stipulating that the official government poisoning squads in
Bali are using strychnine on sausages to kill dogs.

Early in the outbreak, in January 2009, there was some discussion of
using magnesium sulfate, but I have heard nothing further, either
actual or hypothetical, about magnesium being used.

7 outside experts in January 2009 recommended using pentobarbital
instead of magnesium sulfate, but this appears to have received no
serious official consideration.

[Strychnine is a very painful way to die. There is no guarantee that
the rabid dogs would eat the bait. It is unfortunately just as likely
that a pet dog could eat it and die. However, rabies is also a
difficult way to die.

This article does not tell us what type of poison was used. It
probably was not strychnine, unless the individual was treated very
quickly and then it is likely he would have spent some time in the
hospital as he would have been unable to get up and leave.

Magnesium sulfate and pentobarbital are generally regarded as
injectables for euthanasia, so it would likely take a considerable
amount orally to euthanize the dogs. Again, there is no guarantee that
the rabid dog would consume enough of the substance to euthanize them.

The island of Bali is divided into 8 regencies (Badung, Gianyar,
Tabanan, Bangli, Karangasem, Jembrana, Buleleng and Klungkung, and one
municipal city (Denpasar); see
<http://www.2indonesia.com/regency.html>. Three of these, Badung,
Denpasar and now Tabanan, all adjacent, must now be considered
confirmed or probable rabies epidemic areas. Little progress appears
to have been achieved in containing the outbreak. - Mod.TG]

[The symptoms of magnesium sulfate poisoning are abdominal cramps and
diarrhoea, which was not the case here. A pentobarbital overdose would
certainly produce unconsciousness. - Mod.JW]
