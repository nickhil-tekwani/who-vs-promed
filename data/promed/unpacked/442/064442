Health authorities have issued a fresh warning for a flesh-eating ulcer infection after 2 new cases were identified in Far North Queensland. The Cairns and Hinterland Hospital and Health Service told 9News.com.au in a statement that the 1st contraction of the "Daintree ulcer" was identified on Nov 14 [2018] and involved a person living in the town of Mossman. The 2nd case was found on Nov 24 [2018] and involved a person who lives in Daintree.

"In both cases, there was more likely local exposure," said Dr Madhumati Chatterji, the acting director of the Tropical Public Health Services in Cairns. "It is not known how the infection is contracted; there are various theories, including the possibility of insect transmission. While research is ongoing into how the infection is transmitted, people are advised to avoid contact with soil or water where possible, particularly in the Daintree/Mossman area, and to avoid mosquito bites by covering the body with clothing and using insect repellent."

The government warning comes just 2 months after cases of the Daintree ulcer, known as the Buruli ulcer in parts of Australia other than northern Queensland, skyrocketed in Victoria. In 4 weeks, at least 49 cases of the flesh-eating infection were reported [https://www.9news.com.au/2018/10/21/08/17/buruli-ulcer-victoria-coast-mycobacterium-ulcerans-disease-health], bringing the total number of contractions to more than 270 [in Victoria].

According to data provided to 9News.com.au by Queensland Health authorities, 130 cases of the ulcer were identified in the state [Queensland] between 2002 and 2016, including a major spike in 2011 due to an outbreak. In that year [2011?] alone, health bodies were notified of 1.2 cases per 100 000 Queensland residents.

The Buruli ulcer is a flesh-eating disease caused by toxins made in bacteria that can also destroy small blood vessels and fat under a person's skin. The bacteria has been found naturally in the environment, and it is believed it can be transmitted through mosquitoes, plants, and possum faeces. The condition usually starts as a small bump on the skin that appears similar to a mosquito or spider bite, which can then grow in size over coming days and weeks until it turns into a scab. As the scab disintegrates, an ulcer is formed that continues to grow in size; it can be treated with oral antibiotics or surgery if the medication is not effective.

[The news report mentions 2 cases of Buruli ulcer acquired locally: one case in Daintree, and the other in Mossman, towns in the Far North region of the Australian state of Queensland, located near tropical rainforests. The Far North is the northernmost part of Queensland; it is centered in the eastern coastal city of Cairns (population 144 787) and stretches north to the Torres Strait. The settlement of Daintree (population 129) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daintree,_Queensland) is 111 km (69 mi) north of Cairns, and the town of Mossman (population 1937) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossman,_Queensland) is 75 km (47 mi) north of Cairns. A map of the Far North can be found at https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2e/Qld-regions-map.gif.

About 2000 Buruli ulcer cases per year are reported worldwide, most commonly from the tropical regions of West or Central Africa. In Australia, cases are frequently reported from Queensland, mostly in the Daintree region (95 cases between 2009 and 2015), and occasionally from the Northern Territory, New South Wales, and Western Australia. However, most cases are reported from the south eastern state of Victoria, the only non-tropical part of the world where Buruli ulcer is detected.
