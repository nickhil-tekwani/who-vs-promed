The government [of Kenya] has banned the movement of livestock in
Embu District [Eastern Province] following the death of a man from
anthrax. According to district commissioner Mohammed Maalim, the ban
will remain in force indefinitely as the government monitors the
spread of the disease. "We have imposed quarantine because of a
reported case of anthrax," he said. He warned that anyone found
moving their animals from one area to another would be arrested and prosecuted.

Speaking to the press in Embu Town, Mr Maalim said there could be an
outbreak of the deadly disease and urged residents to take the
necessary precautions.

The decision to restrict the movement of animals was reached after a
crisis meeting between the DC and veterinary officials. "We don't
want to take chances with the lives of the people, and that is why we
have taken this bold measure," he said. The administrator said all
the livestock in the area would be vaccinated against the disease to
ensure that it did not spread further. He called on the residents to
take their animals for vaccination when the exercise kicks off next week.

On Tuesday [6 Jan 2009], a man died a few days after slaughtering an
infected cow at Njukiiri village in Manyata Division. The man, 28,
fell sick a fortnight later and died on the way to Embu Provincial
Hospital. He had joined another 9 villagers who were assisting a
local farmer in slaughtering the sick cow. A meat inspector confirmed
that the cow was suffering from the deadly disease and ordered it to
be disposed of. Following the death, other residents who came into
contact with the animal flocked to the hospital for checkups.

[Anthrax, though widespread, is under reported in Kenya, especially
in sheep and goats, and the recent increases may be real but are more
likely just a change in enthusiasm and proximity to diagnostic
facilities. OIE has the following numbers of livestock outbreaks:
2001, 4 cattle; 2002, 6 cattle; 2003, 2 cattle; 2004, 6 cattle; 2005,
19 cattle; 2006, 41 cattle, 2 sheep and goats, 2 involving pigs;
2007, 28 cattle, 4 sheep and goats, 6 pigs; 2008 (6 months) 6, all
cattle. Outbreaks have been reported in the following provinces:
Central, Coast, Eastern, Nairobi, and the Rift Valley. There were 15
human cases in 2001, 106 with 2 deaths in 2005-6, and 10 in 2007.
