An outbreak of _E. coli_ is being investigated in Enniscrone, County
Sligo [province of Connaught], after 6 people became ill with
gastroenteritis. The Health Service Executive (HSE) West said the 6
people had suffered from _E. coli_ O157 infection but are now recovering.
"There are concerns about a possible association between these
infections and people who had been in Enniscrone, County Sligo
between 20 Jul 2007 and 20 Aug 2007," the HSE said in a statement.
It added, however, that it is in the early stages of the
investigation and that no conclusive findings have been made at this
time. As a precautionary measure, the HSE said it would like to
identify members of the public who visited, stayed in, or ate food in
Enniscrone between 20 Jul 2007 and 20 Aug 2007 and who subsequently
became ill with diarrhea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
Anyone who suffered such illness should contact the HSE helpline at
1890 200 548.

[The report of 6 cases may be the tip of an O157 iceberg here as
Enniscrone is a large coastal village in County Sligo, Ireland with a
beach, a tourist campsite, and a golf course, all of which attract a
large number of visitors. The cases noted appear to have occurred
over one month, which could have put many tourists at risk. It is not
yet clear what vehicle (usually but not always food) will be implicated.
Enniscrone's location on the western coast of Ireland can be found at
