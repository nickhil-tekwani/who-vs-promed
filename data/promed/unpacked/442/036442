At least 1000 head of cattle have reportedly died of disease and starvation
in the drought-stricken Kinango and Msambweni areas of Kwale District in the
Coast Province in the last 2 months.
In a dispatch from Mombasa, the agency, quoting residents of the 2 locations
close to the Kenya-Tanzania border, said an outbreak of the dreaded east
coast fever is threatening to wipe out the entire cattle population in the
greater Kwale District.
The residents said the figure of dead animals had only taken into account
adult animals, while a local leader, Councillor Thomas Masai, said hundreds
of calves had also perished within the same period.
Masai said lack of water and pasture was brought about by a prolonged
drought in the area which has worsened the situation.
The agency quoted a resident, Mtende Mwero, as claiming he has lost 33 head
of cattle in the last month due to drought and several others are down with
the east coast fever disease. He complained of lack of drugs to treat the
animals in the area, saying they were only available from Mombasa, 100 km
away.
The disease, Masai claimed, was suspected to have spread into the area from
neighbouring Tanzania. "We usually have a common cattle auction with the
Tanzanians at Mwangulu (market) during which cattle intermingle. It is our
suspicion the disease came from such contacts at the market," he said.
