For the past 3 weeks, the fungal disease esca has increased in Baden. Affected grapevines often cannot be saved. The disease is not new, but is apparently being favoured by the current dry conditions.

Grape growers everywhere in the region report that numerous vines are affected by the disease.

Esca is increasingly affecting viticulture and is spreading worldwide, causing considerable damage. The disease is very complex and further research is needed. So far, 5 different fungi have been identified as being involved [ProMED-mail post 20190507.6457473]. Plants can die within 2 weeks after 1st symptoms appear.

The disease was first described in France in 1912. In Baden, Esca was discovered in 1987 north of Freiburg on a Pinot Noir vine. Initially, only 25-30 year old vines were affected, but since 2000 the fungi have also been affecting younger vines. Since the dry years 2018 and 2019, the disease curve has risen even steeper.

Research at Staatliches Weinbauinstitut Freiburg [State Institute for Viticulture] found that in some areas up to 80 percent of grapevines contained the fungi, but only 1 in 5 developed the disease. It was suggested that the fungi become active when the vine is under stress -- for example due to drought. Some particularly susceptible varieties have been identified, while the burgundy family of cultivars shows stronger resistances. Various strategies for combating Esca are now being tested.

[Esca is a complex disease syndrome involving several fungal species. It is considered a series of pathological events starting in the nursery and finishing when the plant is mature. Esca is an important problem for grape production worldwide and historic evidence suggests that it may have been around since the start of viticulture. However, with climate warming and similar to other fungal diseases, it is extending its global range.

Esca presents 2 different types of symptoms: one characterised by leaf alterations, including interveinal yellowing and necrosis, as well as brown spots on fruit ("measles"); the other by wood degradation and sudden death of the plant. Fungal species so far reported to be associated with the different symptoms in different areas include _Phaeoacremonium aleophilum_, _Phaeomoniella chlamydospora_, _Fomitiporia mediterranea_, _Eutypa lata_, _Stereum hirsutum_, _Phellinus igniarius_, and _Sphaeropsis malorum_. It is suggested that the different pathogens play different roles in the process which starts with leaf discolourations and eventually leads to wood degradation.

Environmental factors favouring esca are still not well understood, but the different pathogens can react differently to these parameters. Where chemical control with sodium arsenite is not permitted, eliminating infected plants and pruning affected plant parts have been suggested to control the disease. Removal of infected material from the vineyard is essential since masses of spores are produced by the fungi even at low temperatures. Spores can be airborne, but can also be spread with plant material, water, contaminated equipment and by mechanical means.
