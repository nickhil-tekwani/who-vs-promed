HEPATITIS B AND ESTHETICS (3)
=============================
Reply to note of 03/13/96 13:28 from Div. Comm. Dis. Cont. 2151 Berkeley Way,

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration published materials entitled
"Preventing Disease Transmission in Personal Service Worker Occupations"
which includes cosmetology, electrolysis, acupuncture, and tattooing.
Although oriented toward preventing disease transmission, particularly of
blood-borne pathogens, to workers, preventing tranmssion to clients is also
covered, including cleaning and disinfection of instruments. Call (301) 763-
1896 for copies (number dates back to 1990). In California a Board regulates
cosmetology and related professions, and has explicit requirements on
disinfection (and also limits the practice of cosmetologists so that items
like pedicures are forbidden from deliberately breaking the skin).
