Colorado: Hantavirus case confirmed in Weld
-------------------------------------------
The second hantavirus case this year in Colorado has been confirmed
in a 30-year-old Weld County man who is now recovering. A Colorado
Department of Public Health and Environment laboratory confirmed the
disease by serologic testing on 18 May 2007. Hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome is a respiratory disease transmitted by rural deer mice that
can infect humans.
Health department officials believe the man was exposed in
northeastern Colorado during April 2007. An environmental assessment
is still underway to definitively determine the origin of the virus.
He was treated at North Colorado Medical Center. Earlier this month,
an Alamosa County woman died from the syndrome.
While the deer mice that transmit the disease are extremely common in
Colorado, human cases are rare, said John Pape, an epidemiologist
with Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Statewide,
only 6 people suffered from the illness last year [2006]. The human
cases tend to peak in May and June because mouse populations increase
during these months, Pape said.
The Health Department is urging caution among Weld County residents
while doing spring cleaning around barns and sheds. The disease is
transmitted to people when they inhale contaminated urine or feces or
come into contact with infected mice. Early symptoms include fever,
headache and muscle pain, severe abdominal, joint and lower back
pain, nausea and vomiting. A cough and shortness of breath usually
develop one to 5 days after the onset of symptoms. The illness
progresses quickly to difficulty breathing due to fluid build-up in
the lungs and respiratory failure.
There is no treatment for the virus itself, but doctors can treat the
symptoms of hantavirus [infection]. Early hospital admission for
suspected cases of hantavirus is important for patient safety.

[The Colorado Department of Health an Environment wwebsite has good
photographs of the deer mouse (_Peromyscus maniculatus_). According
to the website there have been 51 cases of hantavirus pulmonary
syndrome in Colorado during the period 1985 to 2006 and 17 fatalities
(35 percent). The mean ages and age ranges of infected males and
humans have been comparable. The precise identity of the hantaviruses
involved has rarely been determined, but can be presumed to be Sin
Nombre virus from the high percentage of fatalities and the identity
of the vector.
