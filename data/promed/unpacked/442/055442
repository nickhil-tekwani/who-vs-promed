[With the addition of these 6 newly confirmed case of MERS-CoV infection there have now been a total of 13 cases reported by Saudi Arabia since the beginning of October 2019, including 4 deaths. Cases were reported from Asir region (5), Riyadh region (4) Al Qasim (3), and Makkah (1). All but one case were classified as primary cases, with only 2 having a history of camel contact. The secondary case (type of secondary case not specified) was the 2nd case reported from Asir region since 25 Mar 2019 and the 1st of 4 cases reported from Khamis Mushait. With 4 cases reported from Khamis Mushait in the past 2 weeks, one can't help but wonder if there may be the beginning of a cluster either household or health facility related in that city.

One curious occurrence was a report of a 10 year old male case on 26 Oct 2019 from Onaizah in Al Qasim region that was removed from the website several days later. - Mod.MPP
