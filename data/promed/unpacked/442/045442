Aid workers in war-torn Somalia are struggling to contain a dangerous outbreak of the crippling poliovirus, with rampant insecurity hampering efforts, the United Nations said on Friday [16 Aug 2013].

[In 2013], 6 years after the Horn of Africa nation was declared free of the virus, at least 105 cases have been confirmed in Somalia, the "worst outbreak in the world in a non-endemic country", the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in a statement. "The polio outbreak plaguing Somalia has spread despite significant efforts to curb the disease," OCHA added.

While 4 million people have been vaccinated, getting drugs to more than 600 000 children in southern and central Somalia -- areas partly under control of the al-Qaeda linked Al-Shabaab, who block vaccination efforts -- is "extremely challenging", it added.

"The inability to fully access these areas constitutes a major threat to the control of the outbreak," the statement read, warning that "Somalia remains one of the most difficult and dangerous environments in the world for aid workers".

While over 100 cases of children have been recorded, "the fact that this number of children show symptoms of paralysis means that there are probably thousands more with the virus, who do not have symptoms, but are capable of spreading it", OCHA added. [In studies done in earlier years of high poliovirus circulation, for every paralytic case of polio identified there were between 50 and 1000, with an average of 200 individuals, who were infected with the poliovirus without paralytic disease. - Mod.MPP]

Around 10 cases have also been reported in north eastern Kenya, which hosts almost half a million Somali refugees in sprawling camps.

In Somalia, while the bulk of cases are in the southern and central regions, the outbreak has also spread to self-declared independent Somaliland in the north-west.

Polio is spread by person-to-person contact, exacerbated by poor sanitation and a lack of clean water.

Multiple armies are fighting for control of southern Somalia, including rival warlords, Islamist extremists and a rag-tag national army backed by a 17 700 strong AU [African Union] force.

Aid workers report growing attacks on their staff. On Thursday [15 Aug 2013], the medical aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres (MSF; Doctors Without Borders) closed all its operations in Somalia after 22 years of working in the Horn of Africa troublespot, warning of growing insecurity and "extreme attacks".

The withdrawal by MSF, an aid agency that has earned a reputation for working in the toughest of conditions, will cut health care for hundreds of thousands of Somalis. MSF blamed "armed groups and civilian leaders" who it said "increasingly support, tolerate, or condone the killing, assaulting, and abducting of humanitarian aid workers".

[This newswire was included in this update to highlight the challenges existing in Somalia vis a vis security concerns for polio eradication efforts -- both in terms of vaccination activities and surveillance activities. Hence, while it appears as though this area has fewer cases, it is possible there is underreporting due to security concerns as well. The withdrawal of MSF from the area is a significant setback for delivery of services in the area.

Poliovirus detected from environmental samples in Israel -- update -- 15 Aug 2013
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates the risk of further international spread of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) from Israel to remain moderate to high. This risk assessment reflects evidence of increasing geographic extent of circulation over a prolonged period of time.

WPV1 has been detected in 67 sewage samples from 24 sampling sites in Israel, collected from [3 Feb 2013 to 4 Aug 2013]. Initially restricted to southern Israel, WPV1 has now also been detected in the central district as well. WPV1 has also been isolated in stool samples from 27 healthy children (all under the age of 9 years) and one adult, who had been fully immunized for their age as part of ongoing stool sample survey activities. No case of paralytic polio has been reported. In addition to routine acute flaccid paralysis, public health authorities have expanded the surveillance to all age groups, have increased enterovirus surveillance, and are screening aseptic meningitis cases for polio.

A supplementary immunization activity (SIA) with bivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) [bOPV] started in parts of southern Israel during the week of [5 Aug 2013], and a nationwide campaign is planned for [18 Aug 2013] for children up to the age of 9 years. The objective of these SIAs with OPV is to boost mucosal immunity levels in cohorts of children naive to OPV to rapidly interrupt virus circulation.

It is important that all countries, in particular those with frequent travel and contacts with polio affected countries, strengthen surveillance for cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), in order to rapidly detect any new poliovirus importations and facilitate a rapid response. Countries should also analyze routine immunization coverage data to identify any subnational gaps in population immunity to guide catch-up immunization activities and thereby minimize the consequences of any new virus introduction. Priority should be given to areas at high risk of importations and where OPV3/DPT3 vaccine coverage is less than 80 per cent.

WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from poliovirus-affected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. A total of 3 countries remain endemic for indigenous transmission of WPV: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. In addition, in 2013, the Horn of Africa has been affected by an outbreak of WPV1.

ProMED-mail rapporteur Marianne Hopp

[While IPV (inactivated poliovirus vaccine) is an excellent and safe vaccine against polio that protects the individual vaccinated, the production of local immunity [in the gastrointestinal tract] to prevent excretion of the wild poliovirus (WPV) after a vaccinated individual is exposed and infected with the WPV is less than optimal. Hence, the decision to use OPV in the Israeli setting makes sense to assist in interruption of circulation of the WPV. The fact that WPV has been identified in 27 fully vaccinated children further supports the decision to use OPV in Israel.

Data in WHO as of 14 Aug 2012 for 2012 data and 13 Aug 2013 for 2013 data.

Highlights of this week:

Afghanistan
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV cases for 2013 remains 3. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013] (WPV1 from Nangarhar).
- All 3 WPV cases this year [2013] were reported from Eastern Region. In the high-risk Southern Region, no WPV cases have been reported since November 2012.
- No new circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2) cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases in 2013 remains 3. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [13 Mar 2013] (from Kandahar, Southern Region).
- Subnational immunization days (SNIDs) were held on [1-3 Jul 2013], with resources focusing on Southern and Eastern Regions. Planning is under way for nationwide activities in late August [2013].

Nigeria
-------
- One new WPV1 case was reported in the past week, bringing the total of WPV1 cases for 2013 to 43. It is the most recent WPV1 case in the country and had onset of paralysis on [23 Jul 2013] (from Borno).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains one (with onset of paralysis on [6 Jun 2013] from Borno). Although this cVDPV2 case is linked to cVDPV2 currently circulating in Chad which has also been detected in Cameroon, cVDPV2 linked to this transmission chain had previously been isolated from an environmental sample in Kano in March [2013] (indicating circulation in Nigeria).
- Nearly half of all WPV1 cases in the country this year [2013] are from Borno and Yobe state. As many as 35 per cent of children in these states remain under-immunized. This compares to other high-risk states of northern Nigeria (such as Kano, Jigawa, Katsina and Kaduna), where fewer than 20 per cent of children remain under-immunized.
- Targeted approaches are being implemented in those Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Borno and Yobe where access is hampered due to insecurity. However, the majority of LGAs in both states continue to participate during campaigns.
- Tailored approaches are also focusing on LGAs where performance has stalled, and those where performance has decreased.
- Across all areas, strengthened efforts are being made to track the direct engagement and oversight of eradication activities by LGA chairpersons.
- The engagement of communities, and traditional and religious leaders is continuing to be fostered.
- The Volunteer Community Mobilizer Network continues to be expanded, and social data analysis is expected to provide further understanding of why children are missed repeatedly. Innovative social mobilization activities being rolled out are: working with polio survivors' networks as advocates, use of smart phones for data collection and analysis, distribution of pro-OPV messages on CD ROM and DVD, and supporting social mobilization for measles SIAs.
- The next subnational Immunization Plus Days (IPDs) are planned across northern states in September [2013].

Pakistan
--------
- Two new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week (from North Waziristan, Federally Administered Tribal Areas - FATA; and, Gadap, Sindh), bringing the total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 to 24. The case from North Waziristan is the most recent WPV1 case in the country, and had onset of paralysis on [13 Jul 2013].
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 6. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [30 Jun 2013] (from North Waziristan).
- The case from Gadap is the 1st in greater Karachi since January [2013]. However, in 2013, 5 positive environmental samples (WPV1) were confirmed from Gadap, the most recent from [8 Jul 2013].
- FATA remains the major poliovirus reservoir in Pakistan, both due to WPV1 and cVDPV2. Khyber Agency is particularly affected, accounting for 14 of this year's 24 WPV1 cases in the country (9 of which from Khyber Agency); FATA also accounts for 3 of this year's 6 cVDPV2 cases (all from North Waziristan). North Waziristan is an area where immunization campaigns have been suspended by local leaders since June 2012.
- To minimize the risk of a major WPV1 and/or cVDPV2 outbreak in this area, it is critical that access to children is granted as quickly as possible. Immunization campaigns in neighbouring high-risk areas are being intensified, to further boost population immunity levels in those areas and minimize the risk of further spread.

Chad, Cameroon and Central African Republic
-------------------------------------------
- In Chad, no new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent WPV case had onset of paralysis on [14 Jun 2012] (WPV1 from Lac).
- No new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 4 (the most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [12 May 2013] from Ennedi).
- The 4 cVDPV2 cases were reported from various parts of the country, indicating widespread transmission. In some areas, only one immunization round has been conducted in response. A more comprehensive outbreak response to these cVDPV2 cases must be planned and implemented. The risk of further spread within Chad and further international spread remains high (cVDPV2 circulating in Chad has also been detected in Cameroon and Nigeria).
- In Cameroon, no new cVDPV2 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of cVDPV2 cases for 2013 remains 2. The most recent cVDPV2 case had onset of paralysis on [27 May 2013] (from Extreme-Nord).
- Central African Republic (CAR) continues to be at risk of re-infection, due to proximity with Chad and in some areas insecurity. To minimize the risk and consequences of potential re-infection, 2 subnational immunization campaigns were conducted in border areas with Chad (in June and July [2013]). Further activities are planned in September [2013].

Horn of Africa
--------------
- No new WPV1 cases were reported in the past week. The total number of WPV1 cases for 2013 remains 110 (100 from Somalia and 10 from Kenya). The most recent WPV1 case in the region had onset of paralysis on [10 Jul 2013] (from Somalia).
- Access in some areas of south-central Somalia remains a significant challenge. Analysis shows that as many as 70 per cent of children in inaccessible areas are under-immunized. This compares to 20 per cent in accessible areas of the country. Of the 100 cases reported from Somalia, 16 are from inaccessible or only partially-accessible areas (10 districts in total, primarily from Lower Shabelle region).
- Special strategies continue to be implemented in particular in the Lower Shabelle region of Somalia, to improve operations in inaccessible areas. Local-level access negotiations are continuing, as are immunizing older age groups and setting up vaccination posts at entry/exit points of inaccessible areas. Community engagement activities continue to foster engagement of all communities in polio eradication activities. Activities include dissemination of public service announcements (PSAs), partnership with organized religious, youth and women's groups, vaccinator training, media workshops and bulk SMS distribution. The Somali National Women's Association continues to disseminate key messages about the dangers of polio and the benefits of OPV.
- In Kenya, the priority remains on increasing immunity levels in the Dadaab area of North Eastern province. Nearly 50 per cent of children in this area remain under-immunized (compared with less than 5 per cent in Kenya in general).
- The overriding objective remains stopping the outbreak in the affected areas. In addition, the comprehensive outbreak response plan is focusing on protecting populations at high risk, increasing operations in inaccessible areas, and protecting remaining areas across the Horn of Africa. Human resource capacity continues to be scaled up to support outbreak response activities.
- Within this strategic emergency outbreak response context, immunization campaigns across the Horn of Africa, including in Ethiopia and Yemen, are continuing in the 2nd half of August [2013].

West Africa
-----------
- No new WPV cases were reported in the past week. The most recent case in the region was a WPV1 from Tahoua province in Niger with onset of paralysis on [15 Nov 2012].
- Multi-country immunization campaigns are planned in West Africa for mid-October and mid-November [2013], as well as subnational campaigns in Niger in September [2013].

[According to the most recent data available on the Global Polio Eradication Initiative website, there has been an increase of 11 newly identified WPV cases globally since our last global update data from 31 Jul 2013 (Poliomyelitis update (16): Israel, Somalia, Global 20130801.1854632) from 170 cases to 181 cases.

Of concern is the persistent transmission of WPV in the 3 remaining endemic countries, where, in addition to the known circulation of the WPV, there has been circulating vaccine derived polioviruses as well (cVDPV), and persistent foci of insecurity hampering vaccination and surveillance activities.

In addition, the continued circulation of the WPV in Somalia with a similar situation of areas of insecurity where there are challenges to vaccination and surveillance activities.
