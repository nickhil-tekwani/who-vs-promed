Veterinarians have reported a foot and mouth disease [FMD] outbreak
in the Karasuisky district of the Osh region, Kyrgyzstan, adjacent to
the border with Uzbekistan [map at
<http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/commonwealth/kyrgyzstan_pol_05.pdf>].
According to local veterinarians, the same situation occurred in
2006, although at that time, more cattle were affected. The leading
expert of the regional veterinary center reported that the entire
cattle population in the region was vaccinated in autumn of 2006 and
in the beginning of 2007. The current cases are the 1st ones seen
this year [2007].
