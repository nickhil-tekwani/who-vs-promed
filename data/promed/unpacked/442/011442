More than 100 hippos have died in Namibia after they are believed to have contracted anthrax. Rangers at Bwabwata National Park say 109 of the animals have perished since [Sun 1 Oct 2017] last week as pictures show dozens of bloated bodies floating in murky water. While the exact cause of the deaths is not clear, workers believe it could be down to an anthrax outbreak, which is caused by bacterial spores that occur naturally.

Apollinaris Kannyinga, parks deputy director of the north-east regions, told The Namibian that such outbreaks are not uncommon. They usually occur when waters in the Kavango River, where a large number of bodies have been found, are running low, he added.
Veterinarians still need to confirm the cause, and say the death toll could be higher because vultures and crocodiles have been eating the remains. Government officials estimated that Namibia's hippo population was around 1300 before the mass death.

The minister added that he would be alarmed if there were any further hippo deaths at the national park which is one of the country's foremost tourist attractions.

About 109 hippos have been killed in a suspected anthrax outbreak in western Bwabwata National Park in a week.

Parks deputy director of the north-east regions, Apollinaris Kannyinga, confirmed the deaths to The Namibian yesterday [Sun 8 Oct 2017], saying the hippos have died from Sunday last week [week of Sun 1 Oct 2017]. "We 1st noticed the deaths of 10 hippos last week Sunday, but the number increased during the week. As we speak, the number of deaths is 109. We suspect an anthrax outbreak, but our veterinary team is still to confirm that,'' he said.

Kannyinga also said such outbreaks were frequent. "We even saw the one in Tanzania, so as much as the numbers seem to be high, the hippo population usually recovers," he said.

He also said they are currently monitoring the situation, and that the dead hippos are yet to be disposed of. "The other mortalities are dispersed over the river, and the crocodiles and vultures are feeding on them," he said, adding that this is a natural phenomenon caused by the low waters in the Kavango River. We will just sensitise the community not to try and get the meat of these dead hippos for consumption," he said.

The hippo population in Namibia was estimated at 1300 before the latest deaths.

[This park is smack in the centre of the Caprivi Strip, a region of many past wildlife anthrax outbreaks. And it is not unusual for them to overflow in to regional livestock herds. And with outbreaks in the Chobe National Park in adjoining Botswana. I picked the Daily Mail report as it is rich with photographs of afflicted dead hippos. This is something special and typical of hippo anthrax if you have not seen it before.

If you look carefully at the left hand picture in The Namibian and zero-in on the centre, it looks as though there is a hippo there feeding or nuzzling on a carcass. Cannibalism is not unusual with hippos. Thanks to Joe for pointing this out.

Bwabwata is a national park located in north east Namibia. The park was established in 2007 and has a size of 6274 square kilometres (2422 sq mi). It was created from Caprivi Game Park and Mahango Game Reserve. Bwabwata is situated in the Zambezi and Kavango East regions, extending along the Caprivi Strip. It is bounded by the Okavango River to the west and the Kwando River to the east. Angola lies to the north and Botswana to the south. The area is an important migration route from Botswana to Angola for African elephant and some other game species. It is an unusual Protected Area as about 5500 people live in the park. The Namibian government involves park residents and neighbours in planning and managing the park. - Mod.MHJ
