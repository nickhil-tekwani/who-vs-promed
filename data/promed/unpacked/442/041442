Livestock owners are being advised to look out for signs of a disease that has affected horses, cattle, and other animals in several Midwest states.

Missouri State Veterinarian Dr Steve Strubberg announced the state's 1st case of vesicular stomatitis virus, or VSV, in a horse in Newton County on 14 Jul 2020.

Missouri was the 7th state to have confirmed the virus this year [2020]. It has sickened livestock across the country in multiple states including Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Texas.

Officials say VSV primarily affects horses and cattle, but it can also sicken sheep, goats, pigs, llamas, and alpacas. The disease is typically transmitted by biting insects and causes blister-like lesions on the skin.

Humans can contract VSV by coming into contact with lesions, saliva, or nasal secretions from infected animals. In humans, the disease causes a flu-like illness with fever, muscle aches, and headache, officials said.

The United States Department of Agriculture reported on 20 Jul 2020 there had been 5 confirmed cases of VSV in Missouri:
- Jasper County (New Infected County): 3 confirmed positive, 1 suspect equine premises;
- Lawrence County (New Infected County): 1 confirmed positive equine premises;
- Newton County: 1 new confirmed positive, 1 new suspect equine premises

As of [5 Aug 2020], the Missouri Department of Agriculture has reported cases in 7 counties in the state (St Clair, Cedar, Jasper, Newton, McDonald, Ozark, and Camden). A department spokesperson confirmed on [7 Aug 2020] a case in Camden County.

Livestock owners should contact a veterinarian if they spot lesions on their animals.

As a preventative measure, Missouri has required a veterinary examination, a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI), and an Entry Permit for hooved animals entering the state from affected areas.

Since its last Situation Report on [6 Aug 2020], 11 previously suspected or VSV-infected premises have been released from quarantine in Cowley, Labette, Miami, Neosho, and Riley counties.

Since the Kansas outbreak began on June 16, 26 counties have been identified with confirmed positive or suspect premises. Premises released from quarantine number 181, and currently, 15 premises are quarantined in the following counties:
- Butler (2);
- Cherokee (1);
- Coffee (1);
- Harvey (1);
- Johnson (1);
- Labette (2);
- Miami (2);
- Montgomery (1);
- Morris (1);
- Neosho (1);
- Sedgwick (2)

Premises with confirmed positive and suspect cases are quarantined and monitored by veterinarians for at least 14 days from the onset of lesions in the last animal affected on the premises.

------
Vesicular stomatitis virus can cause blisters and sores in the mouth and on the tongue, muzzle, teats, or hooves of horses, cattle, swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and a number of other animals. Lesions usually heal in 2 or 3 weeks.

Because of the virus' contagious nature and its resemblance to other diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease, animal health officials urge livestock owners and caretakers to report these symptoms to their veterinarian immediately. Most animals recover with supportive care by a veterinarian.

"Vesicular stomatitis has been conÔ¨Årmed only in the Western Hemisphere," APHIS said on its website. "It is known to be an endemic disease in the warmer regions of North, Central, and South America, and outbreaks of the disease in other temperate geographic parts of the hemisphere occur sporadically. The Southwestern and Western United States have experienced a number of vesicular stomatitis outbreaks. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways." According to Angela Pelzel McCluskey, DVM, APHIS' equine epidemiologist, the largest VS outbreak in more than 40 years of recorded history occurred in 2019.

Some states and other countries might restrict movement of, or impose additional requirements for, susceptible animals from states having known VS cases. Before moving livestock, contact the state of destination for its requirements.

Vesicular stomatitis virus confirmed in 8 states
------------------------------------------------
Since the start of the outbreak, 323 VSV-affected premises have been identified. (USDA-APHIS)

According to the USDA-Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been confirmed in 8 states this year: Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas.

Since the start of the outbreak, 323 VSV-affected premises have been identified (202 confirmed positive, 121 suspect), according to APHIS. Of these, 310 had only equine species clinically affected; 12 premises had clinically affected cattle (1 premise is yet to be confirmed).

However, there have been no new VSV-positive states identified since 27 Jul 2020, according to the APHIS report issued on 3 Sep 2020. The full report is available at https://bit.ly/3jZoxCJ

Vesicular stomatitis is a viral disease that primarily affects horses and cattle and occasionally swine, sheep, goats, llamas, and alpacas.

Because active cases have been identified this summer [2020], state veterinarians encourage practitioners and livestock owners to be on the alert for suspect cases and to report them to their respective state office.

Other than this year, the most recent and largest VSV outbreak occurred in 2015. Outbreaks usually occur during the warmer months, often along waterways. The time from exposure to the onset of clinical signs is 2 to 8 days, said Rod Hall, Oklahoma state veterinarian, in a news release.

Hall said, "Please make your clients aware that livestock or horses traveling from a county that has had VSV diagnosed within the past 30 days or a county that contains premises quarantined for vesicular stomatitis need to be accompanied by a certificate of veterinary inspection dated within 5 days of entry and contain this statement: "All animals identified on this certificate of veterinary inspection have been examined and found to be free from signs of vesicular stomatitis and have not originated from a premise which is under quarantine for vesicular stomatitis. Please be on the lookout for signs of the disease and let us know if you see livestock or horses with symptoms."

Humans can become infected with the disease when handling affected animals, but this is a rare event. VSV can cause flu-like symptoms if infected saliva gets into an open wound, eyes, or mouth, according to the news release. People handling potentially infected animals should wear gloves for protection and talk with a physician if they have questions.

The 2020 VSV outbreak began on [13 Apr 2020], when the National Veterinary Services Laboratories (NVSL) in Ames, Iowa confirmed the first VSV-positive premises in Dona Ana County, New Mexico.

The virus usually runs its course in 5 to 7 days, and it can take up to an additional 7 days for the infected animal to recover from the signs. There are no approved vaccines for VSV.

Because insects are the primary source of infection, the best way to combat the virus spread is to take aggressive steps to limit exposure to biting flies, ticks, and midges. The virus can also be spread by nose-to-nose contact between animals. Establish insect control measures that consider the animal as well as the area the livestock reside in.

Vesicular stomatitis does not normally kill affected animals, but it can cause economic losses for livestock producers by preventing animal movements and impacting international trade. Farms with affected animals are quarantined until 14 days after lesions appear on the last case at that location.

Quarantine periods can be lengthy if the disease continues to spread within the premises. Quarantines are not lifted until a veterinarian has examined all susceptible animals on the premises.

The 1st sign of illness is often excessive salivation, caused by the lesions in the mouth, according to Wendie Powell, Kansas State University Extension specialist. The blisters will swell and break open, which causes mouth pain, discomfort, and reluctance to eat or drink, leading to severe weight loss. Lesions or scabs will appear on the muzzle, lips, ears, coronary bands, and ventral abdomen. If the coronary bands of the hooves are affected, then lameness can occur. A spike in body temperature before or at the same time lesions Ô¨Årst appear can be noticed. This is a painful virus and can be costly to manage.

[It has been quite a season for VSV. It started as mixed strain with both Indiana and New Jersey strains being confirmed early on. However, USDA and most states seem to drop the issue of which strain was involved. While the disease has a similar presentation with both strains, from a research and disease tracking position knowing the location of the appearance of the different strains can be helpful. While the information has not been made public, perhaps the USDA knows.

We are cautiously optimistic the VSV 2020 season has come to a close. However, the southern states are still quite warm, and the insect season has not closed for those locations. Animal owners are encouraged to remain vigilant for signs of this disease. - Mod.TG
