Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Ukraine -- WHO update 1
---------------------------------------------
As of 3 Nov 2009, according to the Ministry of Health of Ukraine, the
country has now recorded more than 250 000 cases of influenza-like illness,
with 235 patients requiring intensive care. As of 2 Nov 2009, 70 deaths
from acute respiratory illness have been reported. Regions in western
Ukraine continue to show the highest rates of acute respiratory
illness/influenza-like illness. The level of activity in the Kyiv area is
also increasing rapidly.

Laboratory testing in Ukraine has confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza virus
in samples taken from patients in 2 of the most affected regions. As the
pandemic virus has rapidly become the dominant influenza strain worldwide,
it can be assumed that most cases of influenza in Ukraine are caused by the
[pandemic 2009] H1N1 virus. As elsewhere, WHO strongly recommends early
treatment with the antiviral drugs, oseltamivir or zanamivir, for patients
who meet treatment criteria, even in the absence of a positive laboratory
test confirming H1N1 infection.

At the request of the government, a multidisciplinary team of 9 experts has
been deployed by WHO and arrived in Kyiv yesterday evening [2 Nov 2009].
Discussions with the minister of health were held this morning to brief the
team. Team members will now begin field investigations to characterize the
clinical and epidemiological features of the outbreak. Work will initially
begin in Lviv region, where reported numbers of cases showing severe
manifestations of acute respiratory illness have been especially high. Two
virologists on the team have started working at the National Influenza
Centre and the laboratories of the Central Sanitary and Epidemiological
Station in Kyiv to provide diagnostic support. Samples sent by the Ministry
of Health were received today by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference
and Research on Influenza, Mill Hill in London, UK. The laboratory will
conduct confirmatory tests and further characterize the virus.

Many questions remain to be answered. The outbreak in Ukraine may be
indicative of how the virus can behave in the northern hemisphere during
the winter season, particularly in health care settings typically found in
Eastern Europe. Given the potential significance of this outbreak as an
early warning signal, the WHO commends the government of Ukraine for its
transparent reporting and open sharing of samples.

WHO continues to recommend no closing of borders and no restrictions on
international travel, including to Ukraine. Experience shows that such
measures will not stop further spread of the virus.
