In a press conference, Dr Cesar Aguilera, head of bromatology [food science], confirmed [the occurrence of] the only case of hantavirus [infection] in Tartagal [Salta province] and said that work is being done together with the area hospital to avoid the spread of the disease. The case was registered in the Arturo Illia neighborhood, through a [medical] consultation by the affected individual 2 weeks ago.

A small percentage of these wild mice, 5-10 per cent of the "long-tails" could be carriers of hantaviruses. The municipality and the hospital recommend that precautions be taken.

The man stated that previous to development of symptoms, he had been camping for some time in the Virgen de la Pena [Tartagal area]. Upon return to Tartagal he began to have symptoms of the disease, for which he sought medical attention at the Peron Hospital [where] samples were taken and confirmed positive [for a hantavirus infection on Tue 3 Nov 2015].

Dr Aguilera stated that, notified by the hospital, work began in the area of the residence of the patient in the Illia neighborhood, placing traps to capture rodents, carriers of the virus, the "long-tail" species. "The mouse is small, very rural, measuring 6-8 cm [about 2-3 in] in length, but the tail measures 2-3 times more than the body," the doctor said. "Up until now, we are in the phase of investigation. This species of mouse can adapt to urban life and could have come in due to deforestation that has occurred in the region," he concluded.

[As mentioned in the previous posts of cases in Salta province, the hantavirus involved in these cases is likely Oran hantavirus, which occurs in north western Argentina in the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _Oligoryzomys longicaudatus_. Without differential laboratory tests, it is not possible to say with certainty which hantavirus was involved in any of these cases. However, the public in these endemic areas needs to be informed about the need to keep their houses and out-buildings free of rodents, and to avoid places were they might come in contact with rodents and their feces, urine, or saliva. There is little that the health officials could do, other than inform the public of the measures needed to prevent exposure to the virus.

Images of the long-tailed pygmy rice rat, _O. longicaudatus_, is available at http://www.hantavirus.cl/educacion_prevencion/galeria_reservorio.htm.
