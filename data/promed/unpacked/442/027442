[A farmer who] grew ginger in [the district of] Sarpang [Geylegphug] [said] when she harvested, "The ginger rotted in the field." Many farmers say the rotting disease affected their cash crop.

They say they could not report to agriculture officials, as the disease occurred when it was harvest time. [They] said agriculture officials provided them pesticides when they reported the matter a few years ago.

[Rhizome rots of ginger (often associated with wilting diseases) due to bacterial pathogens (_Ralstonia solanacearum_, _Erwinia_ species) and fungi (_Fusarium_ or _Pythium_ species) have been reported from various locations, and occasionally nematodes have also been reported to be associated. They are serious diseases which may lead to total crop losses. Symptoms generally include rotting of leaf bases and rhizomes, yellowing and wilting of leaves and death of the plants.

The pathogens are mostly soil borne and also spread with infected plant material including seed rhizomes, water and by mechanical means. Rhizome rots are favoured by humid conditions and high soil moisture. Disease management may include the use of well-drained planting sites, crop rotation and preventative chemical treatments of rhizomes used for planting. However, in affected areas, even plants derived from disease-free rhizomes have a very high risk of being infected from local pathogen reservoirs.

In India and the surrounding region, _Pythium_ species are most commonly reported as the cause of rhizome rot of ginger (as well as related crops like cardamom) and may also be responsible for the crop damage in Bhutan. All of the commercial ginger germplasm available today is highly susceptible to _Pythium_ soft rot, but the related ornamental _Zingiber zerumbet_ was identified as a potential source of genetic resistance (see link below).

Rhizome rot of ginger was previously reported from Sarpang (ProMED-mail post 20101025.3865) without identification of an associated pathogen; an undiagnosed wilt of the crop was noted in the same year from elsewhere in Bhutan (ProMED-mail post 20100226.0636). These past and current reports may be due to the same pathogen, but reliable diagnosis is needed for effective management of the problems.
