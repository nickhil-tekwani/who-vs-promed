The number of patients who have died from the meningitis outbreak in that entity has risen to 29, according to the Durango Health Secretariat, since one of the 3 patients who were transferred to Mexico City to receive care at the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery died on Monday [26 Dec 2022]. 77 confirmed cases of meningitis, 74 women and 3 men, have been reported as well as 26 hospital discharges.

On Tuesday [27 Dec 2022], the deputy medical director of the General Hospital 450, where all the patients with meningitis have been concentrated, Hugo Almonte de León, reported that one of the patients transferred to the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery, in Mexico City, showed improvement and [was] returned to the medical unit in Durango.

For his part, David Payán, coordinator of Special Care for Victims and Relatives of Meningitis in Durango, said that 574 protocol medical evaluations of meningitis have been granted, 265 supports in diapers and milk, 246 for free transportation, and 493 psychological interventions for patients and relatives. In addition, he explained that the state government has provided 23 funeral aids and 2800 food rations, and 129 various efforts, and that the accompaniment to the relatives of the patients will continue until the end of the health emergency.

Summary of the current situation
--------------------------------
On 4 Nov 2022, the Mexico International Health Regulations (IHR) National Focal Point (NFP) informed the Pan American Health Organization/World Health Organization (PAHO/WHO) about the detection of a cluster of 11 cases of aseptic meningitis of unknown etiology, including one death, all with a history of having undergone surgical procedures with the administration of epidural anesthesia in private hospitals in the city of Durango, Durango State, Mexico.

On 11 Nov 2022, the Mexico IHR NFP shared additional information, indicating that the Institute of Epidemiological Diagnosis and Reference (Instituto de Diagnóstico y Referencia Epidemiológicos, InDRE per its Spanish acronym) confirmed the presence of _Fusarium_ spp. in cerebrospinal fluid samples in 2 of the cases under investigation.

On 15 Nov 2022, the Federal Commission for Protection Against Sanitary Risks (COFEPRIS per its Spanish acronym) imposed quarantine and preventive isolation on the investigational drugs Bupivacaina Heavy (2 batches) and Bupivacaina (2 batches). On 24 Nov 2022, a press release from Mexico's Ministry of Health (1) reported that in response to this event, authorities placed the following medications in preventive quarantine: bupivacaine/glucose (buvacaine heavy) 5 mg/1 mL (3 batches), bupivacaine (buvacaine) 50 mg/10 mL (one batch), as well as morphine (graten) 2.5 mg/2.5 mL (one batch) and morphine (graten) 10 mg/10 mL (2 batches), all made by the same laboratory.

On 8 Dec 2022, COFEPRIS (2) issued a statement informing that the batches of the analyzed drugs by the Laboratory of Analytical Control and Expansion of Coverage of COFEPRIS did not detect the presence of _Fusarium solani_. According to the information provided by the CNE of Mexico, during the investigation, several lines of investigation have been established; so far, the origin of the outbreak has not been identified. The investigation is ongoing.

On 30 Nov 2022, the Government of the State of Durango (3) reported that the fungal agent _Fusarium solani_ was identified in the identified cases.

As of 8 Dec 2022, according to the daily technical report (4) of the meningitis outbreak in Durango, 1787 people who underwent surgeries and received epidural anesthesia since May 2022 have been identified in the 4 private hospitals involved. Currently, COFEPRIS has analyzed 7 batches of different drugs that may be related to this outbreak and the 4 hospitals in which the surgical interventions were performed on the cases have been closed due to serious failures detected during the investigation.

Since the notification of the first cases on 8 Dec 2022, a total of 71 cases of meningitis, including 23 deaths, related to this outbreak have been reported. According to the daily technical report, of the 71 cases, 9 [cases] had a severe clinical presentation, which are hospitalized in intensive care units. Of the total cases, 96% (68) are women, and 90% were women undergoing gynecological-obstetric procedures. The most affected age-group is 25 to 29-year-olds, which accounts for 33% of cases. Regarding the fatal cases, the most affected age-group is 25 to 29-year-olds, which represents 26% of deaths. Only 3 of the cases correspond to men, one of them under 18 years old. Also, 67% of cases presented signs and symptoms between day 0 and day 10 after administration of epidural anesthesia, with a maximum of 90 days. The most common signs and symptoms are headache (96%), nausea (42%) and vomiting (34%), followed by neck stiffness (32%), visual disturbances (27%) and fever (27%).

The health authorities of the Ministry of Health of Mexico, COFEPRIS and the Ministry of Health of the State of Durango are working together to investigate this event, as well as monitoring people who underwent surgeries and received epidural anesthesia in the 4 private hospitals involved.

PAHO/WHO is following this event together with the health authorities of Mexico.

[The above reports summarize the situation as of late December 2022, concerning the fungal meningitis outbreak in Durango, Mexico. As of 10 Dec 2022, a total of 1787 people had undergone surgical procedures and received epidural anesthesia since May 2022 at 4 private hospitals in Durango. As of 26 Dec 2022, a total of 77 cases of meningitis, 74 women and 3 men, were reported among the patients who underwent surgery and epidural anesthesia in Durango, including 29 deaths related to this outbreak. The fungus _Fusarium solani_ was identified in the cases.

_Fusarium solani_, a species complex of at least 26 closely related filamentous fungi, is a common soil fungus that is implicated in plant disease, as well as human disease, notably of the cornea and endophthalmitis, disseminated disease, osteomyelitis, skin infection, and fungemia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusarium_solani).

Fungal contamination of the anesthetic drug that was used during an epidural procedure was suspected. Authorities quarantined various formulations of bupivacaine used in epidural anesthesia, as well as morphine, all made by the same laboratory, but _Fusarium solani_ was reported not to have been detected in the analyzed drug samples. Bupivacaine, often in combination with morphine, is an anesthetic used in epidural nerve blocks during or after surgery or other procedures, such as childbirth (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bupivacaine). We await more information as the outbreak investigation unfolds.

Fungal contamination of a drug administered epidurally caused the large, multistate invasive fungal infection outbreak associated with contaminated methylprednisolone injections in the United States in late 2012 and 2013 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4669562/) and another fungal meningitis outbreak in the United States in 2002 (ProMED post Fungal meningitis, contaminated drug - USA (03) 20021212.6046).

Durango City (population 654 876 in 2015) is the capital and largest city of the Mexican state of Durango, located in northwestern Mexico (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durango_City). - Mod.ML
