More die of encephalitis
------------------------
Nipah [virus] encephalitis claimed 4 more lives in Rangpur and
Lalmonirhat Friday night and Saturday [5/6 Feb 2011], raising the
death toll from the disease to 24. The newly deceased are aged 42, 16
and 4 years of age, resident in Dakshin Goddimari village in
Hatibandha upazila of Lalmonirhat, and a resident of Mirbag in Kaunia
upazila of Rangpur.

The 42-year-old was 1st taken to a local clinic, Modern Clinic, but
was denied admission. Then he was rushed to Rangpur Medical College
(RMC) Hospital where he died at about 7:10pm.

The 4-year-old died at Rangpur Medical College Hospital at 9:00pm on
Fri 4 Feb 2011 and the 16-year-old died at 2:30pm on Sat 5 Feb 2011.
This information was supplied to the Daily Star by RMCH director
Toufiqur Rahman. The 4th victim breathed his last in his Mirbag home
at about 4:30 am, said the local health officer.

Meanwhile, the local administration has declared all the schools of
Hatibandha upazila closed for 6 days from Saturday to control the
spread of the disease.

Hospital sources said 24 encephalitis-infected people are now
undergoing treatment at RMCH, Gangachara Upazila Health Complex of
Rangpur and Hatibandha Upazila Health Complex of Lalmonirhat at
present. The condition of 2 patients admitted to RMCH is said to be
critical, hospital sources said.

The government has confirmed the disease as Nipah encephalitis after
a laboratory test, which is so far confined to the 2 districts. The
Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR),
advised caution while drinking raw date juice as bats, which are the
natural hosts of the disease, usually drink date juice at night.

[Nipah virus is an emerging zoonotic virus (a virus transmitted to
humans from animals). In infected people, Nipah virus causes severe
illness characterized by encephalitis or respiratory diseases. During
the initial outbreaks in Malaysia and Singapore, most human
infections resulted from direct contact with sick pigs or their
contaminated tissues. Transmission is thought to have occurred via
respiratory droplets, contact with throat or nasal secretions from
the pigs, or contact with the tissue of a sick animal.

In outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, consumption of fruits or fruit
products (e.g., raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or
saliva from infected fruit bats was the most likely source of
infection. Fruit bats of the family _Pteropodidae_ -- particularly
species belonging to the _Pteropus_ genus -- are the natural hosts
for Nipah virus. There is no apparent disease in fruit bats.

During previous outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, Nipah virus spread
directly from human-to-human through close contact with people's
secretions and excretions. Nosocomial transmission of infection was
observed also in India, where 75% of cases occurred among hospital
staff or visitors. From 2001 to 2008, around half of reported cases
in Bangladesh were due to human-to-human transmission.

The incubation period (interval from infection to onset of symptoms)
varies from 4 to 45 days. The case fatality rate is estimated at 40%
to 75%; however, this rate can vary by outbreak depending on local
capabilities for surveillance investigations.

Fortunately the current outbreak in Bangladesh though severe is
confined to 2 villages.
