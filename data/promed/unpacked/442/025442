APHIS confirms citrus greening in California
--------------------------------------------
On 29 Mar 2012, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) confirmed the presence of citrus greening, also referred to as huanglongbing, in an Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) sample and plant tissue samples collected from a lemon/pummelo tree in a residential neighborhood in Los Angeles County, California. This is the 1st confirmation of the disease in California. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) collected the samples during ongoing citrus surveys.

Currently, CDFA is in the process of enacting an emergency quarantine in the 5-mile [8-km] radius around the detection site in an effort to prevent the artificial spread of citrus greening. After CDFA establishes an intrastate quarantine for citrus greening, APHIS will enact a parallel interstate quarantine area.

Since 2008, APHIS has regulated portions of California for ACP, the insect vector responsible for transmitting citrus greening.

[Huanglongbing (HLB), or citrus greening, caused by the fastidious phloem-inhabiting bacterium _Candidatus_ Liberibacter asiaticus occurs throughout much of Asia. It is one of the most damaging diseases of citrus crops. The disease is restricted to _Citrus_ and close relatives because of the narrow host range of its vector. 2 other related pathogens, _Ca._ L. africanus (including a subsp. capensis) and _Ca._ L. americanus and their specific vectors exist in the respective areas. HLB has not been reported from the Mediterranean region or Australia.

The disease affects both leaves and fruits. Symptoms include blotchy mottling and yellowing of leaves and small, irregularly shaped fruits with a thick, pale peel, and bad taste. Early symptoms may be confused with nutrient deficiencies. Affected trees become stunted, bear multiple off-season flowers, and may live for only a few years without ever bearing usable fruit.

_Ca._ L. asiaticus is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid (_Diaphorina citri_), but it is also often spread by grafting and possibly seed transmission, and with infected plant material to areas where the vector is already present. Disease management requires an integrated approach including use of clean planting and grafting stock, elimination of inoculum, use of pesticides for vector control in orchards, and biological control of vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Biological control by interplanting of guava is being trialled (ProMED-mail post 20070912.3018).

The pathogen was reported for the 1st time in the Americas from Brazil in 2004 (ProMED-mail post 20040723.2012). Asian citrus psyllids were discovered in Florida in 1998 and _Ca._ L. asiaticus was found there in 2005 (ProMED-mail post 20050910.2683). Earlier in 2012, the pathogen was confirmed in Texas (ProMED-mail post 20120122.0153).
