The Atlantic Veterinary College (AVC) in Charlottetown is examining the 3rd bat found this winter [2013-14] on Prince Edward Island (P.E.I.) with white-nose syndrome.

That makes 2 years in a row the deadly fungus has been discovered on bats on the island. The fungus grows on the animal's nose, waking them up from hibernation and forcing them into the cold where, unable to find food, they die.

"These bats are very helpful to us by eating forest and agricultural pests, and the loss of them in the ecosystem may have impacts on our forestry and agriculture industries," said Dr. Scott McBurney, who works with the Co-operative Wildlife Health Centre at AVC.

"Due to the devastating loss, like 98 to 99 per cent of individuals in a given hibernaculum, the places where bats spend the winter, there are big fears that certain species of bats are going to go extinct."

White-nose syndrome has been discovered in bats in 5 Canadian provinces. A national committee of animal scientists is asking Ottawa to declare at-risk bat species as endangered.

[This is another disease that seems to be rampant, and the bats are very affected by this disease. Research has not kept pace with the devastating spread of this disease. The only bright spot is that some bats are becoming immune to its terrible effects.
