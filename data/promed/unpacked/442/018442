One patient has died of H7N9 bird flu in northeast China's Liaoning Province, local health authorities said on Tuesday [5 Jul 2016]. The death was reported on 16 Jun 2016 at Shenyang City of Liaoning Province, according to the provincial commission of health and family planning.

A 67-year-old man became feverish after he butchered a chicken at home. He was admitted to a local hospital, where his condition was stabilized before getting worse, the commission said.

H7N9 is a bird flu strain 1st reported to have infected humans in March 2013 in China. It is most likely to strike in winter and spring.

[Most human cases are exposed to the A(H7N9) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments, as reported in the above case. Even though small clusters of cases have been reported, including those involving healthcare workers, current epidemiological and virological evidence suggests that this virus has not acquired the ability of sustained transmission among humans, thus the likelihood is low.

Influenza A/H7N9 is an evolving animal virus that has demonstrated the capacity to infect repeatedly since 2013 and must be monitored closely for genetic changes that may render it more favorable for human-to-human spread. - Mod.UBA
