[Various other information sources including pighealth.com and BBC indicate
that it is, in fact, 114 cattle that have been affected, not sheep as
indicated in the text of the OIE report. ProMED-mail would appreciate a
confirmation from someone who knows for sure.
Obviously, a confirmed outbreak on the European continent means that
another barrier has been breached by the virus. The good news is that the
outbreak farm is 500 meters from a farm which imported British sheep in
February, so spread there is not a complete surprise. The outbreak is
located in Mayenne department, inland in northwestern France near the
Loire-Normandy border. The bad news is the wire service reports of 3
suspect sheep on a farm East of Paris. All this despite the extensive
disease control measures the French have already put in place. It is too
early to say definitely how things will go. I just hope the next few days
doesn't bring a spate of bad news from the continent. - Mod.PC
