The government has decided to vaccinate pigs reared within a 10-kilometer
radius of the current outbreak of cholera, including areas of Inchon and
Kimpo, health authorities said yesterday. According to the National
Institute of Research and Quarantine Service, it is the only measure that
can quickly prevent the spreading of the disease among hogs.
"These are regions where many pigs are slaughtered for human consumption,
and it is essential for extraordinary steps to be taken," said NIRQS
president Kim Ok-kyong. He said the latest hog cholera cases occurred
outside the area where the disease was previously detected, thus requiring
measures to prevent any further spreading.
Under the rules of the Office Internationale des Epizooties (OIE, World
Organization for Animal Health), infected livestock must be slaughtered,
but vaccination can be administered as a means of prevention.
Accordingly, Korea can be declared hog cholera-free if there are no new
cases for 30 days after all the infected pigs are slaughtered, Kim
explained. "Naturally, we are taking all precautionary measures, including
the monitoring of cholera-infected hogs and preventing their movement
outside the area of quarantine," he added.
At present, there are some 700 000 pigs within the 10-kilometer boundary
that have to be vaccinated, and health authorities are continuing to
monitor the situation to determine whether others will have to undergo
similar treatment.

[A previous outbreak of CSF was reported in Korea in February 2002,
involving 2 foci. The outbreak was reportedly eradicated without the use of
vaccinations and the imposed animal movement restrictions lifted at the end
of May 2002.
The current outbreak has initially been detected on the island of Ganghwa
(north-west of Seoul) on 7 Oct 2002 and subsequently reported to the OIE.
This outbreak seems to have taken more serious dimensions in spite of the
severe control measures, spreading to the mainland and eventually leading
to the decision of the Korean veterinary authorities to apply emergency
vaccination.
The published statement on the possibility to regain Korea's former
CSF-free status in spite of the vaccinations is based upon the provisions
of Article 2.1.13.6. of OIE's Animal Health Code, titled "Recovery of
free status":
"If emergency vaccination has been practised within the CSF domestic pig
control area, recovery of the free status can not occur before all the
vaccinated pigs have been slaughtered, unless there are validated means of
distinguishing between vaccinated and infected pigs." - Mod.AS]
