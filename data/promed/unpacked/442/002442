Charlie Calisher's characterisation of Africans as victims itself needs
serious examination and I can introduce him to many Africans who would
resent such an adjective.
I don't know about the word 'hostage', but certainly the treatment
of Africans by influential aid organizations in the health field can
be challenged.
I hate offering anecdotal evidence, but I know of many doctors in Ghana
who volunteered to go to Zaire during the Rwandan refugee crisis, but
could not get flights to take them there. My wife, a skilled bush-wise,
resourceful Ghanaian nurse, 13 years experience as a nurse in Britain,
who has nursed in drought and coup conditions back home, could not
interest any of the US emergency organizations during the crisis.
We later met a white, US veterinary nurse, never nursed a human being,
but 'friend of the director' who got herself flown over, boasting of
what she had done.
I am well aware that there are many dedicated, skilled medical
personnel in the developed countries who selflessly give time and
energy to help Africa and Africans. There are also many organizations
which are insensitive, patronizing and careerist. This is no time
for complacency.
Charlie Culisher will have to work a lot harder to convince me that
Africans deserve to be labelled as victims and that the developed
countries medical aid to Africa is above question or criticism.
