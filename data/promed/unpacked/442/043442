_Meloidogyne enterolobii_ detected on potatoes in South Africa
--------------------------------------------------------------
In South Africa, _Meloidogyne enterolobii_ (EPPO A2 List) was 1st reported in 1997 in declining guava trees (_Psidium guajava_) in Mpumalanga province. During the 2011/2012 potato (_Solanum tuberosum_) growing season, 78 composite samples of potato tubers infected by root-knot nematodes were obtained from different potato-growing regions in South Africa.

Molecular analysis (PCR, sequencing) detected _M. enterolobii_ in 5 potato samples which had been collected from the KwaZulu-Natal province. None of the samples tested from the other regions were positive for _M. enterolobii_.

The scientists concluded that _M. enterolobii_ could represent a threat to potato production in South Africa and that control methods should be investigated.

[Root knot nematodes (_Meloidogyne_ species) attack a wide range of plants and cause significant economic losses in many vegetable and fruit crops. The genus contains around 70 species and is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions in many types of soil. Symptoms may include stunting, wilting, and leaf chlorosis, and large galls are formed throughout the root system affecting plant vigour and even killing the host. In potato, tubers are warty and deformed with brown lines and blotches in the outer layers of flesh; quality, size, and number of tubers may be severely reduced, and affected plants show increased sensitivity to other bacterial or fungal pathogens.

The nematodes can persist in the soil for years and are spread by plant material, soil, and mechanical means (for example contaminated equipment). Once they have been established in an area, it is difficult to control or eradicate them. Disease management requires an integrated approach including phytosanitary and cultural measures, nematicides, and use of resistant crop varieties.

_M. enterolobii_ is polyphagous and, although its precise host range is still unknown, has been found on many economically important crops including coffee, soybean, sweet potato, beans, guava, and several solanaceous and cucurbit vegetables. While it originates in subtropical areas, it also poses a serious threat to glasshouse crops in cooler regions. It is considered a particularly aggressive pathogen with increased virulence against crop varieties resistant to other root knot nematodes. For example, it is able to reproduce on tobacco, capsicum, watermelon, and tomato varieties (including root stocks) resistant to other _Meloidogyne_ species.

In the report above, _M. enterolobii_ affected potatoes have apparently been identified only in KwaZulu-Natal which is neighbouring Mpumalanga province, where the pathogen was first reported in the country. It would be important to investigate whether this implies a spread from the original source, and if so, how further spread can be prevented.
