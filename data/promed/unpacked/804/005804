A total of 1104 new cases of dengue were registered in Ceara during
the past week [week of 7 Sep 2008]. According to the weekly
newsletter released by the office of the state Secretariat of Health
(SESA), there have been 40 417 positive [dengue cases] reported this
year [2008]. The disease is present in classical form in 167
municipalities. In relation to DHF, the numbers remain the same [as
reported in] the previous bulletin. The [numbers] are 436 cases and
14 deaths caused by the disease. Already, there have been 511
recorded cases of dengue with complications and 6 deaths attributed
to this serious form of the disease.

For the past 2 years, dengue outbreak foci have been in the coastal
municipalities of Jalisco. Today, there is a [dengue] alert in
Metropolitan Guadalajara, where there are the greatest concentration
of cases. This year [2008], Zapopan is the municipality [in
Metropolitan Guadalajara] in Jalisco with the greatest concentration
of reported cases, with 47 of 86 reported cases.

Norma Jacobo Hernandez, Chief of the Department of Vectors and
Zoonoses of the state Secretariat of Health (SSJ) recognized that, in
concentrating their efforts in coastal communities, preventive
actions in Metropolitan Guadalajara have been relaxed.

"In coastal areas, in contrast to Zapopan, there have been frequent
and continuous efforts to eliminate breeding sites (of the mosquito
vector of the diseases [virus]), within houses, and we have not
carried out this activity with such frequency in Metropolitan
Guadalajara," said Jacobo Hernandez.

This official indicated that the factor which most favors the
presence of the mosquito vector of dengue disease [virus] is the
presence in homes of containers where clean water is stored, an ideal
site for mosquito breeding.

Up until now, the outbreak has occurred in poorer neighborhoods of
Zapopan. However, Jacobo Hernandez stated that this disease is no
respecter of social status and can occur in the most exclusive parts
of the city because it is not related to poverty or marginalization.

Up until now, the actions and operations have not been sufficient to
eliminate all the [mosquito] breeding sites. For this reason,
community participation is necessary so that every person does their
part in the elimination of breeding sites in their homes.

"The idea that simply applying insecticides can control [dengue]
outbreaks is false, but it is simply not that way, it requires the
participation of the community, because I could apply insecticides
that would give me results for a week, but if people don't eliminate
breeding sites, we will have problems with dengue again a week
later," she emphasized. The mosquitoes have great reproductive capacity.

The facts that vector mosquitoes are found in Zapopan increases the
possibility that the outbreak might extend to other municipalities in
the Metropolitan area. The mosquito can fly up to 200 meters, but the
possibility exists that they can travel greater distances, for
example when people transport them in their cars to other places by accident.

[There is perhaps a greater possibility that there are significant
_Aedes aegypti_ populations in other municipalities, and an infected,
viremic person could introduce dengue virus into these areas and
extend the outbreak. The collective municipalities within
Metropolitan Guadalajara essentially present one large populated
area, and there would be no barriers to the spread of vectors or
virus within it, with the exception of those buildings that are air
conditioned, where dengue virus-infected mosquitoes would have
difficulty entering. - Mod.TY]

In the 1st 8 months of this year [2008], more than 7290 people have
been hospitalized for dengue fever in HCM [Ho Chi Minh] City.

This is an increase of 60 per cent compared with the same period last
year [2007], according to the HCM City Preventive Medicines Centre.

In the past 7 days, the number of dengue patients increased sharply,
with more than 250 cases.

The southern province of Tien Giang is particularly hard hit by the
disease, with 3500 people afflicted so far this month [September
2008], of whom 3 died.

[The above newswire reports more than 7290 cases of dengue fever in
Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), an increase of dengue fever cases since the
last PRO/MBDS posting on 27 Aug 2008, when more than 6100 cases were
reported (see prior PRO/MBDS posting Dengue - Viet Nam (11)
20080827.2686 below). In this prior PRO/MBDS posting, there was
mention that HCMC has reported the highest number of dengue cases
infected so far this year [2008], followed by Ca Mau, Soc Trang, and
Tien Giang provinces.

Earlier this month (7 Sep 2008), Cau Mau had reported nearly 5000
cases and 7 deaths of dengue fever during 2008 (see prior PRO/MBDS
posting Dengue - Viet Nam (12): Ca Mau 20080907.2786 below).

A new kind of mosquito with the specific name of [_Aedes albopictus_]
has been found in the inner area of the capital city of Ha Noi,
causing virus and dengue fevers. [One can only wonder whether the use
of the wording here of "virus and dengue fevers" means that another
mosquito borne disease, specifically chikungunya, known to be
transmitted by _A. albopictus_ has been identified in Hanoi. - Mod.MPP]

A year ago, this kind of mosquito only occurred in the suburb of the
capital, where there were many stagnant ponds and dirty channels.

According to the Bach Mai Hospital, the number of patients with the
viral fever [see comment below] is ever higher, from 20 cases in
August [2008] to 5-7 cases per day in early September [2008]. Other
hospitals such as Saint Paul, Dong Da, Buu Dien are overloaded with
patients with the viral fever.

Doctors said that if the disease caused by mosquitoes [_A.
albopictus_] is not treated in time, patients have a high risk of
death [see comment below. - Mod.MPP].

[The above newswire is somewhat confusing, by the initial suggestion
of more than one viral illness being caused by bites of the _A.
albopictus_ mosquito, with this moderator suggesting that there may
be reference to chikungunya presence in the area. The persistence in
use of "viral fever" in the remainder of the newswire does lead this
moderator to believe they are referring to dengue fever and more
severe forms of illness associated with dengue virus infection, such
as dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. A
clarification of this would be greatly appreciated.

There is no data to suggest that dengue virus infections caused by
different members of the _Aedes_ species of mosquitoes are more
severe than others. The _A. albopictus_ mosquito has been a rural and
suburban mosquito, whereas the _A. aegypti_ mosquito is an urban
mosquito. Of interest, in a study of the dengue fever epidemic in
Singapore in 2005, a mapping of dengue cases compared with vector
indices of _A. aegypti_ and _A. albopictus_ showed a correlation
between incidence of dengue and indices of _A. aegypti_. See Koh BK,
Ng LC, Kita Y, Tang CS, Ang LW, Wong KY, James L, Goh KT. The 2005
dengue epidemic in Singapore: epidemiology, prevention and control.
