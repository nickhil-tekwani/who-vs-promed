South Korean officials said on Monday [12 May 2008] that they have killed
all poultry in Seoul, the capital, to curb the spread of bird flu following
a new outbreak of the disease in the city.

Quarantine officials destroyed 15 000 chickens, ducks, pheasants, and
turkeys raised in farms, restaurants, schools, and homes in the capital,
said Kim Yoon-kyu, a Seoul Metropolitan Government official. The Seoul
government said the slaughter was necessary to contain the disease. It said
it will now focus on preventing live poultry from being brought into the
capital.

The slaughter began Sunday [11 May 2008] night, hours after authorities
confirmed Seoul's 2nd outbreak of bird flu in less than a week. The
slaughter did not affect parrots, parakeets, and canaries because they have
little chance of spreading the disease, Kim said.

On Monday [12 May 2008] night, government tests confirmed the latest
outbreak in Seoul was caused by the deadly H5N1 virus, said Yoon Young-ku,
a spokesman at the Agriculture Ministry.

The tests also confirmed 2 additional outbreaks of the virus in Busan,
bringing to 31 the total number of outbreaks in South Korea, he said. Bird
flu began sweeping southern parts of the country last month [April 2008]
for the 1st time in more than a year, forcing the slaughter of about 6.8
million birds.

The virus remains hard for people to catch, but scientists worry it could
mutate into a form that spreads more easily between humans, with the
potential to kill millions worldwide.

Worldwide, at least 241 people have died from bird flu since 2003,
according to the World Health Organization. Most human cases have been
linked to contact with infected poultry.

[The situation of an urban outbreak of H5N1 and the consequent disease
control measures applied in Seoul are reminiscent to some extent of the
situation and measures applied in Hong Kong in 2003. An important segment
of the HK operation included, as a precautionary measure, the closing of
the wholesale and retail poultry markets ("wet markets") for intensive
cleaning and disinfection. See also commentary to item 3. - Mod.AS]

Poultry-related industries embarked on a nationwide campaign yesterday [13
May 2008] with a seminar in Seoul to rectify public misunderstanding of
bird flu. The 7-member umbrella group, including the Korea Chicken Food
Service Association, the Korea Poultry Association, the Korea Duck
Association, and the Korea Egg Distribution Association, held the 1st of
its series of seminars with experts at the Lotte Hotel in downtown Seoul to
help the public fully understand the nature of avian influenza. The seminar
featured veterinary professors and medical professors who sought to educate
the public that poultry and eggs are safe to consume amid the ongoing bird
flu outbreak.

The umbrella group will hold seminars in 9 other major cities across the
nation until late July 2008. Other activities will include raising
awareness through various media promotions, such as TV commercials and
newspaper ads.

Members will also hold poultry-sampling events to show that chickens and
ducks are safe to consume, since the avian influenza virus dies when the
meat is cooked above 75 C for more than 5 minutes.

Scientists are trying to determine whether avian flu has become endemic in
South Korea's wild birds, meaning that it is a threat year-round and not
just during the winter migratory season, a US military health official said
on Monday [12 May 2008].

Health workers have confirmed 2 cases of the H5N1 virus in Seoul in the
past week and a half. Other cases have been confirmed throughout the rest
of the country in recent weeks.

In Japan, a small outbreak of avian flu occurred near Misawa Air Base
several weeks ago.

"Are we just going to have to live with H5N1 in the area?" said Lt Col Eric
Lund, a US Forces Korea preventive medicine consultant. "Every time we go
to the zoo, we say to our kids, 'Don't touch the birds,' but this time
we'll really mean it."

The Associated Press reported on Monday [12 May 2008] that South Korean
officials said they had killed all 15 000 poultry in South Korea's capital
and will prevent live poultry from being brought into the city. Lund said
South Korean officials have found avian flu in 35 locations in the past 6
weeks, compared with 7 locations in an approximately 100-day period in 2006
and 2007.

In 2003, the virus spread to 19 farms in about 100 days, he said. Both
previous outbreaks occurred during the winter, when migratory birds from
Russia and China come to South Korea. "That's why it's a surprise to
everyone, veterinary-wise." Lund said. "It's come back at the end of March
and April, and it's spread so quickly to so many places in such a short
period of time."

The virus typically spreads from migrating birds to domestic chickens,
ducks, turkeys and other fowl. Lund said the virus is only a threat to
humans who work closely with birds and are in contact with their feces,
saliva or other fluids.

Humans rarely transmit the disease to one another, and there are no known
cases of a human contracting it in South Korea. A South Korean soldier
suspected of having the virus was determined not to have it, Reuters
reported on Friday [9 May 2008].

Lund said 4 groups at USFK most at risk for catching the disease are being
watched closely: public works employees who pick up dead birds,
veterinarians, hospital workers and microbiologists who handle samples that
could contain H5N1.

An H5N1 vaccine has been developed but isn't considered effective against
new strains of the virus. The Associated Press reported the South Korean
government plans to double its supply of the drug Tamiflu by the end of the
year [2008], from enough to treat 1.23 million people to 2.5 million. About
48 million people live in South Korea.

Lund said USFK has adequate supplies of Tamiflu to treat an outbreak. The
121st Combat Support hospital got a high-speed lab test last week and can
make a tentative diagnosis of H5N1 in humans in 4 to 6 hours. Lab tests
previously had to be shipped outside South Korea for diagnosis. The test
has not been used yet, Lund said.

For now, people need to make sure they have an updated flu shot and stay
away from wild birds. When they get flu-like symptoms -- a cough, fever,
muscle aches, trouble breathing -- they should ask themselves if they've
been in close contact with birds or a human known to have the disease. USFK
officials have said chickens and eggs sold at the commissary are safe to
eat, and chickens and eggs sold off-post are safe if cooked. "It's a risk
if you put yourself at risk, but otherwise you go about your business
normally," Lund said.

[If H5N1 becomes endemic in South Korea, particularly in urban areas, the
authorities may consider following Hong Kong's (successful) policy,
operational since 2003. This includes the following main measures:
(a) vaccination for chickens in local farms and imported chickens;
(b) regulation of local farms, including tightened biosecurity measures
(for example, all farms should be bird-proof);
(c) import control (for instance, imported chickens must come from
registered farms with health certificates);
(d) segregation policy (no waterfowl, which are natural carriers of avian
influenza viruses, can be sold in retail outlets);
(e) market rest days to break the virus cycle and reduce the viral load;
(f) hygiene requirements on wholesale markets and retail outlets; and
(g) surveillance targeted at humans, poultry and wild birds to ensure
timely detection of the presence of any avian influenza viruses in our
environment.

Amidst a slow culling operation in avian flu-affected Darjeeling district
due to non-cooperation by owners of fowl, a fresh report of bird deaths
worsened the situation.

District magistrate Rajesh Pandey today [12 May 2008] said that the
deadline was extended till tomorrow, as only 9500 birds were culled against
the target of culling 18 000 birds by yesterday.

Animal Resources Development department sources said that the progress of
culling was not as expected because of non-cooperation by poultry owners in
some areas. The target was now increased to 20 000 and was expected to be
completed by tomorrow [13 May 2008], the sources said.

To encourage poultry owners, the department announced revised compensation
for birds culled: Rs 75 [USD 1.77] for a duck, Rs 50 [USD 1.18] for a
layer, Rs 40 [USD 0.94] for a broiler, Rs 35 [USD 0.83] for a duckling, Rs
20 [USD 0.47] for a chick and Rs 2 [USD 0.05] for an egg.

The situation, however, turned worse following reports of the deaths of a
crow, 2 swallows and 7 fowl from Bijanbari area in Darjeeling yesterday [11
May 2008].

Unofficial reports, however, claimed the deaths of 100 birds. The outbreak
of avian influenza at Bagdogra, Matigara, Naxalbari in Siliguri and Sukna
in Kurseong sub-division was confirmed by High Security Animal Disease
Laboratory, Bhopal. The administration has banned trading on chicken and
poultry products in the affected areas.

Meanwhile, there were allegations that the administration, under pressure
from the business community, was not banning the sale of poultry products
in this commercial hub. The relaxation could cause problems, as there was
every possibility that a supply of chickens and poultry products could come
from the affected areas, which were within 15 km of this town, a group of
people said.

[The H5N1-infected Darjeeling district is located within a very narrow
strip of land linking mainland India to its north eastern states, known as
the "chicken's neck". Siliguri, one of the Darjeeling localities mentioned
in the above newswire, is a transit point for air, road, and rail traffic
to the neighboring countries of Nepal, Bhutan, and Bangladesh. This
underlines the epidemiological significance -- in transboundary terms -- of
the information on continued movements of poultry in the region. - Mod.AS]
