The Department of Epidemiology of the Los Santos Health Region reveals that through 30 Sep 2022, the province registered 29 cases of hantavirus -- hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (16) and hantavirus fever (13). No deaths were reported.

The cases have been distributed as follows: Tonos√≠ district (21), Los Santos (5), Las Tablas (2) and Macaracas (1).

The Health Region of Los Santos maintains a constant presence in the communities so that the population becomes aware of the prevention measures for this virus, including proper storage of grains, keeping residential patios clean, sealing holes that serve as burrows for rodents and not throwing food waste on the premises of the houses.

[The above report provides a summary of cases of hantavirus infection so far in 2022 but does not indicate the dates when these 29 cases occurred. ProMED has posted some of them (see Hantavirus - Americas (12): Panama (LS) 20220321.8702127). Although the above and the previous reports do not indicate which hantavirus is responsible for these cases, an earlier WHO report indicates that based on genomic sequence analysis, Choclo is the hantavirus identified in those previous cases (see Hantavirus - Americas (02): Panama WHO 2018 review 20190106.6245148). Curiously, Choclo virus is never mentioned in the popular press reports that come to ProMED from Panama, including this one. It is reassuring to know that the virus responsible for the cases described in the WHO report mentioned above -- or at least the ones for which samples and diagnostic testing were done -- was Choclo virus, which confirms the ProMED conclusion.

Earlier, Dr Jan Clement suggested that Seoul hantavirus might be involved in some of the cases in the Americas, including Panama. The rodent reservoir of Seoul virus is the ubiquitous brown rat (_Rattus norvegicus_). Presumably, genomic analysis by the Gorgas Lab would have detected this virus. Nonetheless, diagnostic laboratories should be aware of this possibility and look for it.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be seen at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg. These rodents live in and around agricultural areas and the adjacent houses and buildings. They can be persistently infected with the virus and shed it in urine, feces, and saliva, the source of human infection. - Mod.TY
