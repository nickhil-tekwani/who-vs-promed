The epidemic of cholera in greater Caracas continues with the confirmation
by health authorities Wednesday of four cases in Catia La Mar on the
seacoast north of Caracas. The Ministry of Health and Social Assistance in
Vargas was aware of three cases in the district of El Piache, and at
mid-week, they confirmed another two cases--one in the prison of La Planta,
and another in the seaside region. Although these cases were thought to
have been due to eating seafood from the beaches of Catia La Mar, Jose Leon
Uzcategui director general of health of the Federal District reported that
epidemiological teams found that the origin of bacteria causing the new
cases of cholera was in oysters acquired in the Coche market in Caracas.
Uzcategui indicated that the current outbreak of cholera that began 6 June
has reached 148 cases with 3 deaths in the metropolitan area. "This figure
includes 60 cases of diarrhea that were found in the prison of La Planta.
Although only 3 cases were confirmed in the laboratory, we have included
the rest in these statistics." The primary focus for health authorities
includes in addition to Coche, Catia La Mar, and the La Planta prison, the
area of Nueva Tacagua. Dr. Uzcategui added that they [the health
department have pleaded with the management of the principal market of the
capital to undertake health control measures such that food handlers are
free of the vibrio bacteria that can be passed on in food. "If they do not
apply corrective measures, we will be obligated to impose sanctions, that
in the last case could include a complete shutdown of the market."
