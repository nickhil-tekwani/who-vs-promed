["West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic mosquito-transmitted arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus in the family Flaviviridae.

WNV has a wide geographical range that includes portions of Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia (Kunjin virus) and in North, Central and South America. Migratory birds are thought to be primarily responsible for virus dispersal, including reintroduction of WNV from endemic areas into regions that experience sporadic outbreaks. WNV is maintained in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle, whereas humans and horses are considered dead end hosts.

Genetic analysis of WN isolates separates strains into multiple lineages. Lineage one isolates are found in northern and central Africa, Israel, Europe, India, Australia (Kunjin virus) and in North and Central America, and Colombia and Argentina in South America. Lineage 2 strains are endemic in central and southern Africa and Madagascar, with cocirculation of both virus lineages in central Africa. Circulation of WNV strains of lineage 2 have recently been reported in Hungary, Austria, Russia, Romania, Greece and Italy. While recent human and equine outbreaks have been due to lineage one or 2 viruses, strains from each lineage might be implicated in human and animal disease.

The occurrence of disease in humans and animals along with bird and mosquito surveillance for WNV activity demonstrate that the virus range has dramatically expanded including North, Central and South America as well as Europe and countries facing the Mediterranean Basin". http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.01.24_WEST_NILE.pdf. - Mod.CRD
