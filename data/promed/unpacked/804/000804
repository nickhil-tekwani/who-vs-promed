Health officials to meet on epidemic of blue-ear in pigs
--------------------------------------------------------
Agriculture officials plan to hold an emergency meeting today [Wed 4
Aug 2010] to discuss an epidemic spreading through the Kingdom's
swine population that some officials have blamed on infected
Vietnamese pigs they say have been dumped illegally on the Cambodian market.

Sourn San, director of the Animal Health Research Institute at the
Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, said yesterday that
80 blood tests conducted last week had revealed an unprecedented
epidemic of pig diarrhoea and blue-ear.

"The disease is caused by [a virus] and experts can only cure some
secondary diseases which those pigs have," he said. The epidemic had
coincided with similar outbreaks in China, Thailand, Laos and Viet
Nam, he said.

Mey Yeoun, deputy director of the Svay Rieng provincial Department of
Agriculture, said diseased Vietnamese pigs, smuggled into Cambodia at
night, were causing the outbreaks.

"Viet Nam has been rushing to export a lot of sick pigs to Cambodia
for the unusually cheap price of only 3000 riels [USD 0.71] per kg of
live pig, down from 8000 riels [USD 1.90] per kg before," he said.
"They are trying to export their pigs to Cambodia before those pigs
are killed by the Vietnamese government."

He said the pig diarrhoea could spread to humans if meat was not cooked well.

Curtis Hundley, chief of party at USAID's Micro, Small and Medium
Enterprise agency, said pigs imported into Cambodia from Viet Nam and
Thailand were not subjected to the same standard as checks applied to
Cambodian pigs exported in the other direction.

"It starts with the illegal import of piglets. It is procedures at
the border. They don't check the pigs," he said.

In a letter last week, Kao Phal, director of the Department of Animal
Health and Production, called for a temporary ban on pig imports and
announced today's emergency meeting with agricultural officials from
every province. "The disease is infectious, and Cambodia may have
caught up with it through the import of pigs from other countries,"
the letter said.

Yeam Chansophorn, director of Battambang's provincial Agriculture
Department, warned that villagers rushing to offload their infected
swine for low prices had created serious health hazards.

According to the animal health law, sick and dead animals cannot be
sold for consumption, but many villagers have eaten those sick and dead pigs.

Significant outbreaks of pig diarrhoea and blue-ear, or Porcine
Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome [PRRS], have so far been
reported in Battambang, Kampong Chhnang, Prey Veng, Kampong Cham,
Svay Rieng, Takeo, Kandal and Kampot provinces.

[The above report refers to 2 disease entities: PRRS and "pig
diarrhoea." The precise meaning of the latter is not clear;
clarification will help.

In the past, possible links between pig-origin _Streptococcus suis_
infections in humans and PRRS in pigs were suspected in China and
Viet Nam; subscribers are referred to the commentary in archived
posting 20070726.2403. One of the clinical signs of _S.suis_ in pigs
(though less common) may be diarrhea.

According to previous media report (see 20100803.2618), Cambodian
animal-health officials allegedly said that the disease "appeared to
be bacterial, making an outbreak of H1N1, sometimes called swine flu,
unlikely." In case the above information, pointing at PRRS as the
diagnosis of the outbreak, is confirmed -- this deserves an official
OIE notification.

A flare-up of PRRS in Viet Nam has been currently reported by the
press (see 20100802.2600). In case this development and the reported
spread reflect a change in the epidemiology of the disease in that
country, notification to the OIE will be in place. - Mod.AS]
