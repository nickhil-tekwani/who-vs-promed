E-MAIL:
----------
If you have World-Wide Web (WWW) or File Transfer
Protocol (FTP) capabilities, we strongly recommend
that you access EID by using WWW or FTP rather
than through e-mail. This is due to the large size
of the journal files and the complexity of sending
e-mail to different systems.
If you do not have FTP or WWW access, you can
request this dispatch via e-mail. Send a
message to EIDLISTMGR@CDC.GOV with the
following in the body of your message:
GET 3 2 EDWARDS ASCII
(for the ASCII version)
GET 3 2 EDWARDS PDF
(for the PDF version)
GET 3 2 EDWARDS PS
(for the PostScript version)
-----------------------------------------------------
The file types available are Adobe Acrobat (.pdf),
PostScript compressed with PKZIP (.zip), and ASCII
(.txt). The ASCII version of the journal does not
contain figures. Both the .pdf and .zip files,
however, contain graphics and figures and are true
representations of the hard copy of the journal. The
Adobe Acrobat format requires an Adobe Reader.
Adobe Acrobat and PostScript files will be e-mailed
in uuencoded format. If your e-mail system does not
automatically uudecode the file, you will need to
uudecode the file manually. PostScript files are sent
compressed with PKZIP.
