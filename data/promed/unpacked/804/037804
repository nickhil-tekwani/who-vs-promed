[A summary with map of this FMDV-A epizootic is available at
<http://www.oie.int/wahis/public.php?page=event_summary&reportid=8266>.
In total, 14 outbreaks have been recorded, including a devastating
event in the country's largest and leading dairy goat farm, with
mortality of 140 adult goats (out of 940) and of 450 kids (out of
810). According to the 2 first quarterly reports of the FAO World
Reference Laboratory for FMD at Pirbright (WRLFMD) for 2009, FMDV
A-Iran-05 has already been identified in the following Middle-Eastern
countries (in brackets, number of positive samples): Bahrein (3),
Egypt (11*), Iran (27), Iraq (11), Israel (18), Kuwait (6), Lebanon
(4), Libya (37), Palestinian Autonomous Territory (PAT)(5), Turkey (4).
(*In Egypt, a serotype A strain of East African lineage has been
identified as well).

The wide-scale spread of the emerging A-Iran-05 strain in the Middle
East is reminiscent of a similar scenario during the years 1964-1966,
when FMDV A22 - IRAQ - 1964 spread rapidly throughout the region,
eventually reaching south-east Europe.

The detailed sequencing data of isolates from 7 of the affected
countries are already accessible at the Molecular Epidemiology page
of the WRLFMD
<http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/2009.htm>. Sequencing of
serotype A isolates from Israel and PAT have also been completed,
awaiting report approval. - Mod.AS]
