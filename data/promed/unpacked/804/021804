[Ducks serve as a natural reservoir for the avian influenza virus. It is therefore, very unusual to have such a high mortality rate in a species where the virus causes little or no mortality, especially when the influenza virus has been reported as being of low pathogenicity. Further diagnostic work on the true cause of the mortality in these ducks may be in order. - Mod.CRD
