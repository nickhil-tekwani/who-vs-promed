The Ministry of Health and Social Services yesterday [Tue 6 Feb 2018] confirmed one case of Crimean Congo fever in the country. The medical superintendent at the Windhoek Central Hospital, Dr David Uirab, told New Era that a 23-year-old man is being kept in isolation at Windhoek Central Hospital because the disease is highly contagious.

The man, who has a history of tick bite, was transported from Gobabis and is from a nearby village in the area. The man is doing well and has responded well to treatment since being admitted to hospital, authorities said. Yesterday [Tue 6 Feb 2018] his blood tests confirmed that he has Congo fever, it was said at a media briefing yesterday afternoon.

"We are not aware of any other contacts that are sick apart from his partner who was also treated and her temperature is under control," said Uirab. Congo fever is transmitted to people by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.

The majority of cases have occurred in people involved in the livestock industry, such as agricultural workers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians. Human-to-human transmission can occur resulting from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs, or other bodily fluids of infected persons.

Uirab stressed that the risks are with people who work with animals. "Once there is an epidemic it can be passed on to humans through any body fluids," he said.

[Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a viral haemorrhagic fever transmitted by ticks. It can be responsible for severe outbreaks in humans, but it is not pathogenic for ruminants, their amplifying hosts. Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) spreads to humans either by tick-bites or through contact with viraemic animal tissues during and immediately post-slaughter.

CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat for public health services because of epidemic potential, high case fatality ratios (10-40 percent), potential for nosocomial outbreaks, and difficulties in treatment and prevention. CCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East, and in Asia south of the 50th parallel north, the geographic limit of the genus _Hyalomma_, the principal tick vector http://www.who.int/csr/disease/crimean_congoHF/en/.

It is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent. Furthermore, the tick vectors are numerous and widespread, so tick control with acaricides (chemicals intended to kill ticks) is only a realistic option for well-managed livestock production facilities.

There are no vaccines available for use in animals. Although an inactivated, mouse brain-derived vaccine against CCHF has been developed and used on a small scale in eastern Europe, there is currently no safe and effective vaccine widely available for human use.

Outbreak of CCHF was reported from Omusati and Omaheke regions of Namibia in 2017. According to the World Health Organization, CCHF was 1st reported in Namibia in 1986, with 3 cases recorded. Subsequent outbreaks have occurred in 1998 (one case), 2001 (2 cases), 2002 (one case) and 2010 (3 cases), scattered across 5 regions (Otjozondjupa, Khomas, Omaheke, Karas, and Kavango).
In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure to the virus
