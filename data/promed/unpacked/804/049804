Source: Press release from Livestock Industry Bureau of Ministry of
Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries, Japan
<http://www.lin.go.jp/maff/maff.htm> only in Japanese. The same contents
are reported in the website (http://www.niah.affrc.go.jp/FMD/top.html only
in Japanese) authored by Tadahiro Inoue and Kunio Satou.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries in Japan reported to
the Office International des Epizootties(OIE) a suspected FMD (Foot and
Mouth Disease) outbreak occurred in the farm where 10 Japanese Black beef
cattle are fattened in Miyazaki Prefecture
<http://www.niah.affrc.go.jp/FMD/report-oie.html>. Ninety-two years have
passed since the last outbreak of FMD in Japan in 1908.
Our Institute sequenced VP1 gene of FMD virus from the sample from the
first suspected Japanese Black cattle and sent the sequence data to
Institute for Animal Health (IAH), Pirbright in the United Kingdom, the
World Reference Laboratory for FMD endorsed by the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO/WHO) and OIE. The IAH replied that the sequence is
related to FMD virus O type spread in Asian areas but this is a new one and
recommended to call the gene O /Myazaki/JAP/2000.
Then on 4 Apr 2000 the Government confirmed the cattle are really infected
with FMD virus <http://www.niah.affrc.go.jp/FMD/japan/report-oie2.html>.
But the virus has not been isolated. In addition, on 3 Apr 2000 the beef
cattle were serologically positive to FMD virus using liquid phase
competitive ELISA developed in IAH in Pirbright, but [the animals had no
clinical signs such as vesicles around mouth and on tongue in a farm
epidemiologically related to the first outbreak in Miyazaki Prefecture.
On the English website, [the above described suspected animals are cows
and calves, but they are beef cattle. I do not know whether the beef cattle
are Japanese Black beef cattle or not. All 9 cattle were retested and 6 of
9 were serologically positive. Then all 9 cattle were destroyed on 4 Apr 2000.
Since [During the period 25 Mar to 4 Apr 2000, the Government clinically
surveyed 24,981 farms of dairy cattle, 26,494 farms of beef cattle, and
3,633 pig farms in the movement control area as well as epidemiologically
related farms outside these areas. No abnormal animals have been detected.
The serological survey was conducted among the area. The results show that
[all of 3,576 sera are negative except one.
On 10 Apr 2000, another suspected outbreak (total 3 outbreaks) was found in
the beef cattle breeding farm in the same town. The evidence of FMD
infection is serologically positive to FMD virus. All 16 animals were
destroyed. The duration of the movement control will be extended for three
weeks from 10 April 2000.
I would like to emphasize the following. Though fever and respiratory
symptoms were observed in the first FMD outbreak in Miyazaki Prefecture,
vesicles around mouth and on the tongue are small, but no vesicles on the
hooves or lameness have been observed, which are typical clinical signs of
FMD. Furthermore, neither the detection of the viral antigen nor viral
isolation has succeeded.
In the second outbreak, the clinical manifestation could not be recognized,
but only the serum antibody was detected. However, it has been proven for
the virus strain to spread rapidly among cattle in the farm by the antibody
inspection, when this viral strain invades to the farm.
As a result of surveillance, the pathogenicity of the FMD virus strain,
which prevails in Miyazaki Prefecture, is weak for beef cattle. And the
antibody detection is the most reliable test for diagnosis. These findings
have raised the new problem on prevention of epidemics of FMD.
