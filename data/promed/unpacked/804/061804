Outbreak of hepatitis A among men who have sex with men, Barcelona, Spain
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Between 1 Sep 2008 and 9 Mar 2009, 150 cases of
hepatitis A were reported in Barcelona,
representing a 3-fold increase compared with the
same period in previous 2 years. The majority of
the cases occurred in adult men, including 87 who
reported having sex with men. This indicated the
possibility of an outbreak ongoing in the
population of men who have sex with men (MSM) and
emphasised the need to target this community with
more effective vaccination programmes.

Introduction
------------
In Spain, hepatitis A is a reportable disease
defined by acute hepatitis symptoms combined with
the presence of immunoglobulin M antibodies to
hepatitis A virus (IgM anti-HAV) [1]. Physicians
and laboratories report cases to the local public
health agencies. The Public Health Agency of
Barcelona is the relevant office for the city of
Barcelona, covering a population of 1 600 000
inhabitants. The Health Department of the
Government of Catalonia collects cases from all
the regional agencies of Catalonia and reports
them to the National Centre of Epidemiology in Madrid.

Since September 2008, an increase in the number
of reported cases of hepatitis A in the
municipality of Barcelona has been observed.
Between 1 Sep 2008 and 9 Mar 2009, a total of 150
confirmed cases of hepatitis A were reported from
the area. In the same period in 2006-2007 and
2007-2008 the numbers of notified cases were 54 and 55 respectively.

The notification data indicated that the increase
may affect predominantly men who have sex with
men (MSM). An outbreak alert was raised after 5
cases had been notified in one day, including 4
men aged 23-25 years of whom 3 were known to be
MSM. For comparison, in the previous 2 years, the
average number of notifications ranged from 0 to
12 cases per month. This prompted us to undertake
a survey among the reported adult male cases, to
determine whether they belonged to the group of
MSM and whether they engaged in activities
associated with an increased risk of hepatitis A infection [2-5].

The outbreak is still ongoing and notifications
occur at a frequency of one case per day.

Methods
-------
For the purpose of the outbreak investigation, a
case was defined as a man over 18 years old who
had sex with men, was resident in Barcelona city
and had symptoms of acute hepatitis with onset
from 1 Sep 2008 and positive result of IgM
anti-HAV test. To identify cases according to the
above definition, all reported hepatitis A
patients who were male and older than 18 years,
resident in Barcelona city and had symptoms onset
from September 2008 were interviewed with a
modified questionnaire based on the standard
questionnaire for hepatitis A of the Health
Department of the Government of Catalonia but
with additional questions on sexual behaviour.
The interviews were done by telephone or e-mail.
Cases that had been reported before the outbreak
alert but could fulfill the case definition
criteria were re-interviewed retrospectively, using the modified questionnaire.

Questions included having sex with men, number of
sexual partners, visiting bathhouses, bars and
discos, use of the internet to look for sexual
partners, having group sex, and working as sex
worker during the 2 months before symptoms onset,
as well as hepatitis A immunisation status and
infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Contact-tracing was performed according to
standard procedures, as done routinely by the
local Public Health Agency for every case of
hepatitis A reported. During the interview, the
patient is asked to identify close contacts.
These people are then contacted directly by the
Agency and informed about the risk of infection
and offered vaccination or postexposure
prophylaxis. Vaccination and immunoglobuline is
provided free of charge in the Agency offices or,
in some cases, administered by health care
workers visiting the contacts. Sera from 14 cases
who fulfilled the case definition were sent to
the Enteric Virus Laboratory of the Department of
Microbiology of the University of Barcelona for genetic analysis.

Results
-------
From 1 Sep 2008 to 9 Mar 2009, a total of 150
laboratory-confirmed hepatitis A cases were
reported. Of the 150 cases, 137 (91 percent) were
older than 18 years, and of these, 126 (84
percent of the total) were men and 11 (7 percent
of the total) were women. In the equivalent
period in 2006-2007, of the 54 hepatitis A cases
reported, 29 (54 percent) were older than 18
years, including 21 (39 percent) men. Similarly,
in 2007-2008, there were 55 cases in total, 24
(43 percent) of whom were over 18 years old, including 13 (23 percent) men.

Of the 126 adult male patients, 107 were
interviewed using the modified questionnaire. In
response, 87 (69 percent) declared to have had
sex with men and 20 (16 percent) defined
themselves as heterosexual. For the remaining 19
notified cases (15 percent) this information was not available.

As a result, 87 persons fulfilled the case
definition criteria. The median age of these
cases was 33 (IC 95 percent: 31-34) years. Ten
(11 percent) were HIV-positive. Only one had been
vaccinated against hepatitis A and another one
had received only one dose of the vaccine. A
considerable proportion of MSM cases reported
engaging in activities that may be associated
with increased risk of infection. The mean number
of sexual partners was four (IC 95 percent: 3-6),
14 cases (16 percent) used the Internet to look
for sexual partners, 26 (30 percent) frequented
discos or bars and 19 (22 percent) visited
bathhouses. The virological analysis showed HAV
genotype IA in sera obtained from 14 patients.
The results of phylogenetic analysis are not available yet.

Control measures
----------------
Vaccination against hepatitis A of all cases'
contacts and postexposure prophylaxis of close
contacts and sexual contacts within 15 days of
the last exposure has been recommended.
Vaccination and immunoglobuline is offered free
of charge in the Public Health Agency of Barcelona.

We performed contact-tracing and offered
vaccination and immunoglobuline to those
identified. In cases when patients did not have
or did not want to give this information (address
or telephone), we advised them to inform their
partners and close contacts to get the vaccination or immunoglobuline.

In addition, we have also strengthened the
existing recommendations for vaccination of MSM
by distributing fliers and posters in
collaboration with the Spanish "Coordinadora
Gai-Lesbiana" a federation which coordinates the
activity of gay non-governmental organisations
(NGO) and other associations. The vaccination
program for hepatitis A and B in gay bathhouses,
which has been in place in Barcelona since 2004,
has been reinforced, as well, by increasing the
number of visits of health care workers and by
covering more establishments. To raise awareness
about the possible outbreak, e-mail alerts were
sent to microbiology laboratories, local
practitioners and hospitals to enhance
notification. Gay organisations were informed
about the hepatitis A outbreak affecting MSM, and
information about the outbreak was published on some gay websites.

Discussion
----------
An increase in the number of reported hepatitis A
cases in Barcelona has been observed since
September 2008. Of the 150 cases reported between
1 Sep 2008 and 9 Mar 2009, 87 were identified as
MSM. An increase in the number of notifications
has recently been observed in other regions of
Spain, as well. The data available are from the
period between week 36 of 2008 and week 4 of
2009. Andalucia has reported an increase from 175
and 125 cases for that period in 2006-2007 and
2007-2008, respectively, to 350 in 2008-2009;
Madrid has reported an increase from 95 and 75 to
230 and Castilla Â­ La Mancha has registered an
increase from 15 and 20 cases to 60 [6]. It is
not clear whether these increases are due to
outbreaks and whether they affect a particular
risk group but investigations are ongoing.

In Spain vaccination for hepatitis A is not
included in the routine immunisation schedule,
but is recommended for certain risk groups, including MSM. [7]

In recent years, 2002-2003 and 2004, 2 outbreaks
of hepatitis A among MSM, affecting 48 and 60
people respectively, were detected in Barcelona.
Most of them (80 percent) were bathhouse users
[data from the Public Health Agency of Barcelona,
not published]. Similar venues have also been
associated with hepatitis A outbreaks elsewhere
in Europe [2-5]. The strain identified in the
current outbreak is different from the one
detected in the MSM outbreaks in 2002-2003 and 2004.

Since 2004 a special vaccination programme for
hepatitis A and B has been targeted at those who
frequent gay bathhouses. Health care workers from
the Public Health Agency of Barcelona visit these
venues and offer information about hepatitis A,
B, C and sexually transmitted infections (STI),
perform rapid tests for HIV and administer
vaccinations for hepatitis A and B. To date, 3000
bathhouse guests have used this opportunity [data
from the Public Health Agency of Barcelona, unpublished].

The scenario in the present outbreak seems to be
different from the previous 2 outbreaks since
only 22 percent of the cases identified as MSM were bathhouse users.

Interventions aimed at the sexual contacts of the
cases were difficult to carry out since in a
considerable proportion of the cases the partners
could not be identified in the course of
contact-tracing process. All but 2 cases among
MSM were unvaccinated. Vaccination of MSM could
help to control this outbreak and is crucial in
preventing future ones. Thus information
campaigns and immunisation programmes which
effectively reach the MSM community are needed.

[This analysis reveals that a recent increase in
hepatitis A in north-eastern Spain can be
attributed to spread of infection among men who
have sex with men (MSM). Vaccination of MSM could
help to control this outbreak and prevent similar outbreaks elsewhere.
