STRIPE RUST, WHEAT - AUSTRALIA (SOUTH AUSTRALIA): NEW STRAIN

South Australian wheat crops are under pressure from the new strain of
stripe rust -- with virulence for the Yr17 resistance gene -- discovered in
Victoria and New South Wales last year [2006].
SARDI [South Australian Research and Development Institute] pathologist Dr
Hugh Wallwork says the new strain of stripe rust could be more damaging
than all previous strains, and reminds growers that allowing rust to
develop on susceptible wheat varieties increases the rate at which new
strains evolve. Stripe rust has recently been identified at a number of
sites in SA.

[Wheat stripe rust (also called yellow rust) is caused by the fungus
_Puccinia striiformis_ var. _striiformis_ and occurs worldwide mostly in
cooler climates. It causes yellow leaf stripes, stunting of plants, and
reduced grain number and size on developing heads. Yield losses may vary
from 40 up to 100 per cent. It affects wheat, some barley varieties,
triticale, and a number of grass species. Spores are wind dispersed in
several cycles during the cropping season. The fungus needs living plants
to survive between seasons, it cannot survive on seed, stubble, or in soil.
Volunteer plants may generate a "green bridge" providing inoculum to infect
new crops. Disease management strategies include the use of resistant
varieties, fungicide applications and control of volunteer wheat plants.
Since the fungus interferes with seed development, infection early in the
crop cycle is more damaging than infection after seed fill has concluded.
Early discovery of infection at any stage of the crop cycle is important so
action can be taken to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as build-up
of inoculum.
The Australian Cereal Rust Control Program monitors the occurrence of
cereal rust pathotypes each year and in 2003, for example, 6 pathotypes of
stripe rust were identified throughout Australia. The new strain reported
here has apparently overcome one of the major stripe rust resistance genes
used in wheat breeding and may pose a serious problem to farmers in eastern
Australia.
