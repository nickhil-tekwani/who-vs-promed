Severe problems of resistance against trypanocidal drugs have been
encountered in Ghibe valley, south-western Ethiopia, where the International
Livestock Research Institute has been looking for means to eradicate
trypanosomiasis, a livestock-threatening disease transmitted by tsetse
flies.
It is estimated that 45 million cattle and 100 million sheep and goats in
Africa are at risk of contracting the disease, says the institute's latest
newsletter ''Livestock Research for Development.'' In Ethiopia alone, 7
million cattle are at risk from trypanosomiasis, a debilitating disease and
rapidly fatal if untreated. The disease, commonly known as [African
sleeping sickness, also affects humans.
The recurrence of infections in cattle treated with trypanocidal drugs in
the valley ''led to the conclusion that these drugs are no longer able to
cure animals''. [This is a matter of protozoan drug resistance, and not
resistance from the insects that carry the disease to insecticides - Mod.TG
Currently, 3500 farm households from over 100 villages in Ghibe valley are
engaged in research on alternative vector control options. Armed with the
knowledge from the earlier projects, researchers sought other control
methods, particularly controlling tsetse populations using targeted
insecticide treatments on animals.
Of the three tsetse control trials at Ghibe, the use of cypermethrin pour-on
formulation on cattle proved to be a long-term success while the placement
of insecticide-impregnated targets in the grazing areas was only a temporary
success. Tsetse fly traps and impregnated targets were found to be
vulnerable to theft.
Deltamethrin pour-on was unsuccessful in the cattle treatment. The failure
in the use of this insecticide verses cypermethrin was attributed to
''differing epidemiological circumstances at each trial site. As a result
there was a high level of reinversion causing failure at the site where
deltamethrin was used.''
The newsletter said insecticide treatments can have positive effects on
health and productivity without large reductions in the density of tsetse
files. ''One possible explanation is the insecticide treatments control
other nuisance flies, not just tsetse.''
Besides using trypanocidal drugs, the institute has been exploiting the
genetic resistance exhibited by some indigenous breeds such as 'N'dama
cattle and Djallonke sheep found in West Africa. The institute ''is
particularly interested in ways to better exploit these between-breed and
within-breed differences in the susceptibility to trypanosomiasis.''
Lessons from Ghibe and elsewhere in contrasting environments are being
applied to guide interventions in tsetse and trypanosomiasis control across
Ethiopia and Africa.

[Trypanosomiasis is a serious disease in livestock. There are several drugs
to treat this protozoan disease in animals. It is unclear if these protozoa
have become resistant to all of these drugs or only to one or two of them.
In contract, melarsoprol is the only drug on the market that I am aware of
that can treat human patients in the advanced stage of African
trypanosomiasis, also known as African sleeping sickness. African sleeping
sickness, when untreated, is almost always fatal. African trypanosomiasis is
one of the most difficult tropical diseases to diagnose, and affects almost
300 000 people in 36 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. In 1996 it was
estimated that a total of 55 million people in Africa were at risk of
infection - Mod.TG
