Hepatitis A Alert; As Many as 900 People May have been Exposed
---------------------------------------------------
As many as 900 people could have been exposed to hepatitis A while
visiting an upscale Kelowna restaurant, the Interior Health Authority
announced on Wed 13 Oct 2004. Dr. Leila Srour, the Okanagan's Medical
Officer of Health, announced that a female food worker at Kelowna's
My Martini Place was diagnosed on Tue 12 Oct 2004 with hepatitis A
virus infection, and could have been contagious since 15 Sep 2004.
"We are alerting the patrons of the restaurant who ate or drank at
the restaurant from 28 Sep to 5 Oct 2004 to have hepatitis A
vaccinations as soon as possible," Srour said, estimating about 400
people were in the restaurant during that time, and adding that free
vaccines are available for anyone affected. She said, however, the
vaccine would be of no help to customers who were in the restaurant
between 15 and 28 Sep 2004 -- as many as 500 people -- because it is
now too late for it to take effect. Anyone who is feeling ill and who
was in the restaurant before 28 Sep 2004 should see a doctor
immediately, she said. "Hepatitis A can be very serious," Srour said.
"It can cause death and it can cause severe [illness] for older
people, especially those more than 50 years old."
Srour said she has issued a national and international alert in hopes
of reaching as many as possible of the people who were in the
restaurant, especially since the period of infection occurred during
part of the Okanagan Wine Festival, which is known to draw people
from around the world. While she agreed it will be difficult to reach
everyone, noting the timing of the wine festival makes it more
difficult, Srour said the potential for exposure could have been
worse. The restaurant has only been open since 17 Jun 2004, and, she
said, was therefore not established enough to serve as many customers
as some others might have done during the same period.
Spread normally through unsanitary food handling, hepatitis A is a
disease of the liver that can cause nausea, fever, dark urine and
yellowing of skin and eyes. Most people who get the virus recover
completely and then do not get hepatitis A again. Some cases can be
more serious, however, leading to prolonged illness and even death.
In healthy adults, hepatitis A is fatal in only about one in 1000
cases, Srour said. For people over the age of 50, however, that jumps
to almost 2 in 100, making it more important for older people to seek
medical attention if they are showing symptoms.
The woman -- who did not prepare meals but did work with raw fruits
and vegetables and did serve drinks -- first showed symptoms 3 Oct
2004 and stopped going to work after 5 Oct 2004, Darrow said. On 8
Oct 2004 she saw a doctor, who was uncertain what was causing her
illness, but after further testing was able to diagnose it as
hepatitis on Tuesday. Once health officials heard the news, Srour
said, they immediately made preparations to begin vaccinations, then
came out with the public warning Wednesday.
Darrow, the restaurant owner, said he and the sick employee have no
idea where she got the illness. "We live in a society where disease
can be spread easily," he said, suggesting there are any number of
scenarios where she could have contracted the virus, and that it
likely came from outside his restaurant. Still, he said, all 12
employees in his restaurant have been vaccinated. The Interior Health
Authority confirmed that Darrow has been very cooperative and said
the restaurant can't be faulted for what happened.
"We're probably the safest restaurant in town right now," Darrow
said. So far, he said, reservations have not dropped off and people
seem to understand that, since the employees have now been
vaccinated, the risk has all but disappeared.
Srour said no cases have been reported of anyone contracting the
illness from the restaurant, and the risk of transmission is "low."
But she said "There is still a risk, and we never know who is going
to get it." The problem could get much worse, she said, if anyone did
contract the virus and has gone on to prepare food for others. She
urged everyone who was at the restaurant to be mindful of personal
hygiene.
