Disease Situation: Recently, on a pig farm in Fushan County [Linshen Municipality in Shanxi Province] with 179 head of piglets of around 30 kg, there appeared fever, shivers, cyanosis, and multiple deaths. Treatment regimens for CSF and HPS infection were initially followed. First, Radix Isatidis injections, Bupleurum injections, Sulfamonomethoxine tablets, and cephalosporins were used with poor effects. Then, treatment regimens for swine paratyphoid were followed, using mainly Florfenicol injections. Results were still sub-optimal, with steady increases in illness and death among pigs.

Diagnosis: Based on the disease situation, clinical symptoms, necropsy findings, and laboratory testing, the final confirmed diagnosis was mixed infection by Classical Swine Fever and porcine contagious pleuropneumonia.

In recent years, with the development of intensive hog raising and increased hog density, plus [the use of] tightly closed hog sheds in winter, mixed infection of the 2 diseases shows up frequently.

[Classical swine fever (CSF, Hog cholera) is a highly infectious viral disease of swine, an OIE-listed disease (previously designated a "List A" disease), which is regarded as endemic in China. Its incidence in China has, according to the annual OIE reports, undergone a significant decrease since 2010. CSF is often mixed with other viral, bacterial and other diseases, such as enzootic pneumonia or mycoplasmal pneumonia (e.g., _Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae_), Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), porcine circovirus and porcine contagious pleuropneumonia (PCP), caused by _Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae_ (APP).

The latter, mentioned in the above Chinese media report, is an infectious porcine respiratory-tract disease causing severe economic losses worldwide in the swine industry. These marked economic losses are associated with retardation in the growth of infected pigs.

Different clinical forms may be observed, from peracute to subacute or chronic. Clinical signs are characterized by respiratory dyspnea with nasal and oral bloody discharges, affecting pigs from any age but mostly those 12-16 weeks old, with characteristic lesions which consist of a mostly bilateral necrotic haemorrhagic pneumonia of the caudal lung lobes. The causative agent is a non-sporulated, immobile, facultative aerobic, haemolytic and fermentative, Gram-negative coccobacillary bacterium.

15 different serotypes are recognized based on the capsular antigens. Serotypes 1, 2, 5, 9 and 11 are considered virulent isolates, being responsible for either acute or chronic outbreaks of PCP. The agent is regarded endemic in all pig-raising countries and is not a reportable disease.

Some of the above information is derived from Gomez-Laguna, J., et al., Infection dynamics and acute phase response of an _Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae_ field isolate of moderate virulence in pigs. Vet. Microbiol. (2014) http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2014.08.015. - Mod.AS
