Over treatment and over diagnosis of Lyme disease have become associated
with inappropriate use of health services, avoidable treatment-related
illness and substantial disability and distress, according to a study from
Yale University's School of Medicine.
The study indicates that apprehensive patients can also cause doctors to
hastily prescribe treatments without fully recognizing the consequences.
Although some of the improper treatment and diagnosis was "patient driven,"
some responsibility did lay with the attending physician, researchers said.
Of the 209 patients studied, 60% turned out not to have Lyme disease at
all, but still made an average of seven visits to a doctor, had four blood
tests and underwent 42 days of antibiotic treatment. Of that group, 42%
said they suffered depression after becoming convinced they had the
disease. More than half reported adverse events from the antibiotics and
20% sought additional treatment.
Lyme disease remains one of the most difficult diseases to treat because
the symptoms may mimic other illnesses and lab tests are often unreliable.
Current endemic areas include the northeastern coast of the United States,
the upper Midwest and northern California into Oregon. Ticks carry the
infection and transmit the _Borrelia burgdorferi_ spirochete.

[There have been suspicions for some years that Lyme disease is greatly
overdiagnosed in the USA. This study showing such overdiagnosis conflicts
with the statement that Lyme disease may be greatly under-reported. - Mod.JW
