Poultry vaccinated to prevent virus spread by migratory birds
---------------------------------------------------
The epidemic control headquarters of southwest China's Guizhou Province has
decided to vaccinate all poultry within 10 km of the Caohai Lake area to
prevent bird flu virus spread by migratory birds.

Migratory birds in frigid northwest China come to Caohai Lake every October
to survive winter and leave the area in April of the following year.

Located in the outskirts of Weining County town at an elevation of 2200
meters, the 45-sq-km Caohai is the largest natural freshwater lake in Guizhou.

Caohai is home to 184 kinds of birds including 7 rare species under top
government protection. Apart from the black-necked crane, the only plateau
crane left in the world, Caohai Lake hosted 514 common cranes, 1427
bar-headed geese, and 9750 ruddy shelduck this winter.

Though no cases of bird flu have been found in the region so far, the
provincial epidemic control headquarters is on high alert. It ordered a
thorough investigation of wild and domestic poultry at Caohai Lake.
Epidemic prevention workers are vaccinating poultry in designated areas and
disinfecting poultry pens.

[2] China, H5N1 - vaccines

Vaccines target bird flu virus
------------------------------
2 new vaccines for the H5N1 bird flu virus have been developed by Chinese
scientists, the Ministry of Agriculture announced Thu, 11 Mar 2004. The
new vaccines are safer and more effective than previous versions developed
at home and abroad, the ministry's spokesman said.

Laboratory studies showed the 2 new vaccines can produce highly intensified
antibodies that target the H5N1 virus and can remain effective within an
animal's immune system for as long as 10 months, much longer than other
vaccines of its kind in the world, scientists said.

Developed by more than 30 Chinese scientists from 2 national key
laboratories, the new vaccines got preliminary approval from the National
Agricultural Bio-Safety Committee and the ministry's Animal Medicine
Evaluation Committee.

Thanks to their safety and efficiency in small-scale trials, the new
vaccines have been put into large-scale production and are expected to be
used widely on poultry and birds.

"The new vaccines will give the fight against bird flu a powerful boost,
both in China and the rest of the world," the spokesman said.

The virulent H5N1 strain of avian influenza virus is proving difficult to
stamp out, with new and recurring outbreaks among poultry despite the
slaughter of 100 million birds. Experts said culling is by far the most
effective way to combat the disease, though it can also worsen the plight
of poor farmers unless they get help.

Meanwhile, the WHO influenza network has decided to provide China with
prototype vaccine strains to assist developing a bird flu vaccine for
humans, said Roy Wadia, of the WHO's China office.

The prototype bird flu vaccine is likely to be available by the end of
[March 2004] and will be given to vaccine makers around the world,
including China, which can produce clinical batches for first-phase tests
on humans, he added.

Meanwhile, Hong Kong Thursday started accepting applications for the
importation of chilled and frozen poultry meat from the mainland.

Hong Kong officials said they monitored the bird flu outbreak situation in
the mainland very closely before deciding to resume the imports.

[Obviously, the Chinese, who have been applying vaccination against HPAI
since 2002, are trying hard to improve their vaccines. The pretentious
statements in the above news item are in need of supportive data.
Unfortunately, our previous requests for such data, in particular relating
to the virus strains used, their inactivation or attenuation, adjuvants in
use, testing procedures, etc. remain unanswered. Assistance from informed
sources will be highly appreciated. - Mod.AS]

Gov't plans nationwide crow, pigeon tests for bird flu
-----------------------------------------------------
The Environment Ministry said Fri, 12 Mar 2004, it and the agriculture
ministry will ask prefectures to carry out random tests on living wild
crows and pigeons for the bird flu virus to determine how it is spreading
in Japan.

It will be the first nationwide study of wild birds in connection with
avian influenza outbreaks in Japan. The Environment Ministry said it hopes
to get a better understanding of the outbreak especially in terms of wild
birds living near people.

Avian flu virus: Outbreak fears strike Uttaradit
------------------------------------------------
Chicken-farmers in Uttaradit have been reporting mass deaths of their birds
since early this month, leading to fears of a return of bird flu, a local
official said yesterday.

Liam Phromklai, a village head in the province's Muang district, said that
more than 300 local small-time raisers in his village had told him that
between 30 and 50 of their chickens had died each day since the beginning
of [March 2004]. The villagers are afraid of another bird-flu outbreak in
Uttaradit as it was one of the provinces hit by the recent epidemic, he said.

In mid-February 2004, as the government was about to declare that bird
influenza was under control, fresh outbreaks were detected in Uttaradit's
Nam Pat and Muang districts. The province earlier reported that it had
contained outbreaks in Tron and Phichai districts.

Mass deaths of chickens have continued in the province, the village headman
said yesterday. The raisers had buried their dead chickens but failed to
properly disinfect their farms due to lack of involvement on the part of
the authorities, he said.

Jintana Yimyanyong, owner of a chicken farm in Uttaradit's Muang district,
said yesterday that she had lost almost half her 3000 birds since mass
deaths on her farm began early [in March 2004]. She said that the dead
chickens had been buried but that she was unsure whether the steps taken
were correct as no officials had given advice on what to do.

Uttaradit's caretaker livestock chief, Wannee Nakbua, said samples had been
collected from a number of chicken farms in the province for lab tests to
determine whether there was a new outbreak there. She expected results of
the tests on Monday. If they are positive, the districts the samples came
from will be declared bird-flu epidemic areas, she said.

Meanwhile Charal Trinvuthipong, director-general of the Disease Control
Department, yesterday dismissed a media report that a new human case of
bird flu had been found in Uttaradit. He said there was only one confirmed
case there and no reports of suspected cases.

In Chiang Mai authorities are also awaiting results of lab tests to
determine whether the recent deaths of more than 400 chickens and ducks
were linked to bird flu, said Thira Ananworapanya, the province's livestock
chief. He said that the symptoms of the dead fowl were "very similar" to
those of bird flu.

[Obviously, recent Thai statements about regained HPAI-free status were
premature. In accordance with Article 2.1.14.2 of the OIE's Terrestrial
Animal Health Code, a country can consider itself free from HPAI 6 months
after the last infected flock is culled. For example, the Dutch Chief
Veterinary Officer informed the OIE on 11 Nov 2003 as follows: "The last
infected flock was culled on 11 May 2003. Since the above-mentioned last
infected flock, no other cases of HPAI have been recorded in the
Netherlands. In accordance with Article 2.1.14.2 of the Terrestrial Animal
Health Code, the Netherlands considers itself free from HPAI as from 11 Nov
2003". - Mod.AS]

[A recent newswire
<http://www.fchornet.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2004/03/10/4050d397c96e2> had
the following statement: "Economically, avian influenza will not be as
devastating to Asian economies as last year's SARS epidemic, analysts at
HDSC, a global bank, said. This is because poultry sales are not as
substantial to Asian countries' gross domestic product as revenue gained
from tourism." This suggests that the tourism tax revenue is higher than
an agricultural tax revenue. One suspects that Thailand, as the fourth
leading poultry exporter in the world, is very concerned, and does not have
sufficient funding to fully compensate the farmers affected by the outbreak
thereby creating a significant internal economic crisis. Hence a desire to
declare an HPAI-free status and resume poultry exports. - Mod.MPP]
