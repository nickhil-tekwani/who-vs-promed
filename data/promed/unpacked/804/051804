Bird flu virus found at Ibaraki farm that had mass chicken deaths
-----------------------------------------------------------------
A weak strain of the H5N2 type avian influenza virus has been detected in
chickens at a poultry farm in Mitsukaido, Ibaraki Prefecture, where about
800 of its 25 000 chickens died between April and June 2005, the Ministry
of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said on Sunday [26 Jun 2005].

The ministry announced a ban on transporting chickens and eggs from within
a 5 km radius from the farm to places outside of the area to prevent any
possible spread of the virus, although prefectural officials who checked
the site and nearby farms on Saturday [25 Jun 2005] found no further
abnormalities.

On Monday [27 Jun 2005], the authorities will begin culling all of 25 000
chickens currently kept at the infected farm and disinfecting the site. The
H5N2 type is a weak strain of the bird flu virus, compared with the more
deadly H5N1 type that hit Japan in 3 outbreaks last year in Yamaguchi, Oita
and Kyoto prefectures.

The farm reported the case to the Ibaraki prefectural authorities on Friday
[24 Jun 2005] after a simple test conducted by a private organization at
the farm's request turned out positive results for the virus. The infection
was confirmed by the National Institution of Animal Health by Sunday.
Currently, the number of eggs laid by chickens at the farm has recovered to
normal, and there have been no more mass deaths of the birds. Eggs from the
infected farm have been shipped to the market through distributors in
Saitama Prefecture and retailers in Tokyo.

[Typically, avian influenza of low pathogenicity may be, at times,
clinically expressed by an ephemeral drop in egg production without further
noticeable symptoms. Such cases may escape immediate diagnosis to be
detected later by serological examinations. - Mod.AS]

Bird flu virus found in chicken in eastern Japan
------------------------------------------------
A type of bird flu virus has been detected at a chicken farm in eastern
Japan where hundreds of fowl died earlier this year [2005], a Japanese Farm
Ministry spokesman said on Sunday [26 Jun 2005].

The virus that was detected was a "weak" form of bird flu, the spokesman
said. Kyodo news agency said the strain identified was "H5N2", which is
less virulent than the "H5N1" strain found in previous avian flu outbreaks
in Japan.

The H5N1 virus has killed dozens of people in Asia since 2003, while
millions of birds have been slaughtered to contain the disease. Around 430
chickens died between March and May [2005] at a chicken farm in Ibaraki
prefecture, an official for the Ibaraki prefectural government said earlier.

The Farm Ministry plans to limit the movement of eggs and chickens in a 5
km (3 mile) radius around the chicken farm to prevent the virus from
spreading, Kyodo said.

Local officials inspected the farm on Saturday [25 Jun 2005], but found "no
particular irregularities" among chickens, the Ibaraki official said,
adding that the incident was reported to local officials on Friday. Japan
suffered several outbreaks of bird flu last year [2004], including an
outbreak in Kyoto in western Japan in February.

After the February 2004 outbreak, some 240 000 chickens and 20 million eggs
were disposed of at the Kyoto farm and another one nearby to prevent the
disease from spreading.

[This case of H5N2, though -- probably -- of low pathogenicity, should be
notified to the Office International des Epizooties in line with Article
2.7.12.5. of the Terrestrial Animal Health Code. According to the said
(revised) article, a Notifiable avian influenza (NAI) is defined as an
infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus of the H5 or H7
subtypes. An NAI can be subdivided into 2 categories related to its
pathogenicity for chickens, being either high (HPNAI) or low (LPNAI), as
defined by prescribed criteria.

A low pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus was detected on 2 farms in
Taiwan during January 2004. The outbreak was promptly eradicated by the
application of stamping-out policy without vaccination. According to their
follow-up report to the OIE, an extensive targeted surveillance did not
detect any evidence of the virus since 9 Mar 2004. - Mod.AS]
