The epidemiological situation of the Ebola virus disease in the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri dated 4 Jun 2019:
- since the beginning of the epidemic, the cumulative number of cases is 2025, with 1931 confirmed and 94 probable. In total, there were 1357 deaths (1263 confirmed and 94 probable) and 552 people cured;
- 295 suspected cases under investigation;
- 5 new confirmed cases, including 2 in Katwa, 1 in Kalunguta, 1 in Mabalako, and 1 in Mandima;
- 3 new deaths of confirmed cases, including 2 community deaths -- 1 in Katwa and 1 in Kalunguta -- and 1 death at the Mabalako ETC;
- 10 new recoveries released from ETCs: 8 in Katwa and 2 in Butembo.

News
- The minister of health undertook a 2-day mission to Goma, Beni, and Aloya (Mabalako). Mabalako, which was the epicenter of the epidemic in August 2018, is facing a new outbreak concentrated in the health area of Aloya. Nearly 1/3 of new confirmed cases recorded in the last 21 days come from this area, making Mabalako the 1st hot spot of the outbreak, followed by Butembo and Katwa.
- During the minister of health's visit to Aloya, a popular assembly was held in the city center with a delegation of customary chiefs. The population was very receptive to the awareness messages and committed to ending Ebola at home as soon as possible.

Figures of the response
-----------------------
- 130 254 vaccinated persons
- 215 people vaccinated on 4 Jun 2019;
- of those vaccinated, 35 952 are high-risk contacts (HRC), 64 286 are contacts of contacts (CC), and 30 016 are front-line providers (FLP);

So today is a rare (lately) day with only a handful of #Ebola cases. I'm not sure I trust this figure though. I hear things at Beni are still tense after the violence earlier this week; if response workers are restricting their movements, surveillance would be affected. 1/
3. Health minister @OlyIlunga was in Mabalako today urging the community to work to contain the #Ebola outbreak. Mabalako was the original hotspot for the outbreak last August [2018] & has seen the most transmission in the past 3 weeks of any of the transmission centers.
4. The weekly #Ebola report from @WHOAFRO is out. It notes there've been some good metrics in the past week or two. Fewer cases (though still lots!). More patients coming from contact lists, a sign surveillance is doing a better job tracking the virus. Less spread in hospitals.
5. But problems remain. The average time from detection of an #Ebola case to isolation in a treatment center (to prevent them from spreading the virus) is 6 days. And that's for cases detected before death. Too long. Delays in detection = delays in finding, vaccinating contacts.

[there is a notable absence in reports of cases from Beni over the past few days, most likely related to the current instable situation following another attack on the part of insurgents in the area. - Mod.MPP]

Security
--------
- The Komanda lab was robbed overnight on 3-4 Jun 2019. The thieves took away 2 laptops, a GeneXpert device used to test samples, and other materials found in the lab.
- A dozen people were killed by suspected rebels during an armed incursion in the neighborhood of Rwangoma, in Beni, which occurred on the night of 3 Jun 2019. Exchanges of fire began in the evening, shortly after the response teams left Rwangoma where they organized a community dialogue. This Tuesday morning [4 Jun 2019], hundreds of protesters took to the streets and several commercial activities were paralyzed in the city. The Beni response teams worked slowly and cautiously, but no response activity was temporarily suspended.

News
Evolution of the Ebola epidemic
-------------------------------
- The bar of the 2000 cases was passed Sun 2 Jun 2019. Despite this milestone, the developments of recent weeks are positive although we must remain vigilant.

Among the positive developments:
- Slight improvement in the security situation: the last attack against military teams and operations of the response against Ebola, which cost the life of Dr Richard Valery Mouzoko Kiboung, dates back more than a month. Although threats against the response remain high, the decrease in the number of targeted attacks allowed the teams to make up some of their tardiness to contain the spread of the epidemic. However, the security situation remains volatile and unpredictable. With respect to incidents of reluctance or community resistance, the majority of these incidents are resolved through the involvement of community leaders, sensitizers, and psychosocial experts.
- Geographical containment of the epidemic: despite the difficulties of response teams to do their work because of the security situation, the epidemic continues to be geographically contained, protecting the rest of the country and neighboring countries. To date, no cases of Ebola have crossed the borders of the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the epidemic has not spread in large, highest-risk urban centers, namely Goma, Bunia, and Kisangani. However, the risk remains high given the significant population movements. Moreover, since the beginning of the epidemic, 188 health areas in 22 health zones, through the provinces of North Kivu and Ituri, reported at least one case of Ebola. As of 2 Jun 2019, 9 health zones, including 106 health areas (56% of total), spent more than 21 days without notifying new confirmed cases. The 9 health zones concerned are Kyondo, Oicha, Kayna, Mutwanga [North Kivu], Komanda, Bunia, Rwampara, Nyankunde, and Tchomia [Ituri].

The main challenges to be addressed to end this epidemic are:
- Epidemiological surveillance: in order to break the chain of transmission, all contacts of confirmed cases must be listed and followed for 21 days. Now, among the 911 new confirmed cases recorded between [1 Jan and 7 May 2019], only 398 (44%) were registered as regular contacts. Thus, we must strengthen the listing and tracking of contacts involving more community authorities and leaders.
- Prevention and infection control (PCI): the prevention and control of infections should be strengthened in community health facilities to reduce the rate of nosocomial infection. Between 25% and 30% of infections occur in health facilities.
- Community death: the rate of community deaths remains high. Between 28% and 43% of deaths reported every week take place outside of an Ebola treatment center or a transit center. These deaths occur either in private hospitals and clinics, in community health centers, or at home. However, with the contagiousness of a patient being maximum after his death, funerals worthy and secure are possible to limit community spread. What is positive is that the majority of community deaths benefit from a secure and dignified burial.

Democratic Republic of Congo: Ebola Virus Disease - External Situation Report 44
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Situation update
As the Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak surpasses the 2000 case mark, indicators over the past 2 weeks provide early signs of an easing of the transmission intensity. This follows a period of improved security and therefore access to communities, allowing response teams to operate more freely. A total of 88 confirmed cases were reported each week for the past 2 weeks, down from a peak of 126 cases per week observed in April 2019. Declines in the incidence of new cases have been most apparent in hotspots such as Katwa, Mandima, and Beni health zones. Concurrently, improvements in the proportion of cases among contacts registered prior to onset (up from 30% 3 weeks ago to 55% last week), and a lower proportion of cases resulting from transmission within community health facilities (from 31% during the 1st week of April 2019 to 9% during the last week of May 2019) are encouraging, although both indicators are below where we would aim to be. The outbreak continues to be contained to 13 active health zones in North Kivu and Ituri provinces. However, substantive rates of transmission continue within affected communities, and further waves of the outbreak would be expected. An increase in the incidence of new cases has been reported from Mabalako health zone this past week, and high infection rates continue within Butembo metropolitan. Times between detecting, reporting, and admission of cases at Ebola treatment/transit centres (ETCs) remain too long (median 6 days, interquartile range 49 days in the past 3 weeks), with about a third (34% in the past 3 weeks) of cases dying outside ETCs. Collectively, these indicators highlight that the risks associated with this outbreak remain very high.

In the 21 days between [13 May-2 Jun 2019], 82 health areas within 13 health zones reported new cases, representing 46% of the 179 health areas affected to date (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 297 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (27%, n=79), Butembo (22%, n=64), Katwa (15%, n=46). and Beni (12%, n=35).

As of [2 Jun 2019], a total of 2008 EVD cases, including 1914 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1346 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1252 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2008 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 58% (1159) were female, and 29% (585) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected rising to 110 (6% of total cases).

- Tue 4 Jun 2019. International rescue committee comments
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/06/aid-groups-weigh-drc-topping-2000-ebola-cases
[Byline: Lisa Schnirring]

As expected, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) health ministry marked an Ebola outbreak milestone of passing 2000 cases late yesterday [Mon 3 Jun 2019], and groups working in the region called for pushing the reset button on the response.

In its daily update yesterday [Mon 3 Jun 2019], the DRC said the outbreak passed the 2000-case bar on [Sun 2 Jun 2019]. Officials said that, although the landmark is concerning, the health ministry sees some positive signs, including a slight improvement in the security situation, though the situation remains volatile and unpredictable. The ministry added that most incidents related to community resistance have been resolved by community leaders, sensitizers, and psychosocial experts.

Another positive sign is that the outbreak is still geographically contained, though the risk remains high because of significant population movements. Also, 9 earlier-affected health zones have gone 21 days without reporting any new cases.

DRC officials said the 3 main challenges are stronger identification and follow-up of all contacts of confirmed cases and infection prevention and control in community health facilities, where 25% to 30% of Ebola infections occur. Also, the ministry said community death rates remain high, and 28% to 43% of Ebola deaths are occurring outside Ebola treatment or transit centers.

"Drastic change is required"
-----------------------
In a statement yesterday [Mon 3 Jun 2019], the International Rescue Committee (IRC) pointed out that, since the outbreak total hit 1000 in late March [2019], daily cases have more than tripled. The group is working in Katwa, Butembo, and Beni to support health ministry staff, is helping the provincial capital city Goma prepare for Ebola, and is working with women and children to help them cope with the outbreak's impact.

With persistent mistrust and insecurity hampering daily response activities, the current total is probably an undercount, the IRC warned.

Tariq Riebl, IRC emergency response director, said, "The fact that we have hit 2000 persons infected with Ebola so quickly demonstrates that this outbreak is spreading faster when it should be slowing. We are now seeing 8-20 cases recorded each day," adding that just a few months ago, officials were recording 3-5 new cases each day.

"To see such a spike in cases at this stage in the outbreak means a drastic change is required. This response requires a total and complete reset," he said. He noted that a recently announced scale-up by the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, a group that coordinates humanitarian assistance between groups under the United Nations (UN) umbrella and nongovernmental organizations, is a step in the right direction.

In a statement today, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) also called for a response restart. Nicole Fassina, the IFRC's Ebola coordinator, said the response has undoubtedly saved lives and prevented the spread of the disease, but now a reset is needed to put communities at the center of all efforts.

The IFRC also raised concerns about the use of more intensive security or military support, despite ongoing community resistance and threats and attacks from armed groups. "Increasing armed protection for Ebola responders may aggravate the tensions that already exist between communities and responders," it said.

And Oxfam today, as it weighed in on the 2000-case landmark, said it welcomed the UN-led scale-up in humanitarian aid, which it said is a crucial part of building trust with communities, after months of mistrust. Oxfam has been working in the outbreak region to support the public health response at the community level, to provide safe and clean water, and to improve health center infrastructure.

Corrine N'Daw, Oxfam's country director, said in a statement, "Our teams are still meeting people on a daily basis who don't believe Ebola is real. While we are working to challenge that, many cases are going unnoticed because people with symptoms have been avoiding treatment. This lack of trust makes it impossible to break the chain of transmission."

Deaths rise to 1346
-----------------
Meanwhile, in its daily update yesterday [Mon 3 Jun 2019], the DRC reported 14 new cases, lifting the official total to 2008. The latest infections are in 5 different hot spots: Mabalako, Butembo, Katwa, Mandima, and Kalunguta. Health officials are still following up on 281 suspected cases.

Seven more people died from Ebola, boosting the fatality count to 1346. A total of 6 people died in community settings, an occurrence that raises the risk of transmission, and one person died at Butembo's Ebola treatment center.

[The recognition that a change needs to be made in the response is universal, but not what that change should be, other than engaging the community to build trust, a major challenge. The "listening projects" described below represent an excellent starting point. The archives developed from the West Africa outbreak are a good starting point to bring to the DRC community. And archiving new discussions with the DRC community for all to listen to would be a great next step. Authoritative approaches will only lead to greater mistrust and possibly violence. - Mod.LK]

- Mon 4 Jun 2019: Oxfam reaction
[Oxfam, abridged, edited]
https://www.oxfamamerica.org/press/oxfam-reaction-number-ebola-cases-democratic-republic-congo-drc-reaching-2000/

In response to the number of Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) reaching 2000, Oxfam's country director in the DRC, Corinne N'Daw said: "It is clear the current response to tackle Ebola isn't working. No matter how effective treatment is, if people don't trust or understand it, they will not use it."

"Our teams are still meeting people on a daily basis who don't believe Ebola is real. While we are working to challenge that, many cases are going unnoticed because people with symptoms have been avoiding treatment. This lack of trust makes it impossible to break the chain of transmission.

"Also, the number of violent attacks over the last few months has meant most aid organizations, including Oxfam, have had to repeatedly suspend activities. This has seriously hampered the ability to vaccinate people, decontaminate houses, and carry out safe burials, resulting in a peak in cases. We fear another peak could happen in the next few weeks.

"Since the UN has stepped up their leadership in the Ebola response and is going to scale-up humanitarian aid, there's an opportunity to reset the response and make sure it is focused on building this crucial trust with communities, without which we won't be able to win the fight against Ebola."

- Mon 3 Jun 2019 Ebola hits 2000 cases as vaccine OK'd in some pregnant, lactating women
[CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease research and Policy), abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/06/ebola-hits-2000-cases-vaccine-okd-some-pregnant-lactating-women
[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

This outbreak, in its 11th month, is the world's 2nd largest after West Africa's 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak, which involved more than 28 600 cases and more than 11 300 deaths.

The DRC topped 1000 cases on [24 Mar 2019], 8 months into the outbreak. It added its 2nd 1000 cases in only 71 days, or just a little over 2 months later, data that demonstrate how the outbreak has accelerated.

Vaccine for pregnant, lactating women
-------------------------------------
Yesterday [Sun 2 Jun 2019] the ministry of health confirmed that an ethics committee at the School of Public Health at the University of Kinshasa had approved an amendment to the vaccination protocol dictating the use of Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine.

The amendment will allow clinicians to offer the vaccine to pregnant women past their 1st trimester of pregnancy and to lactating women, if they are identified as case contacts. The committee maintains that only children over the age of 6 should be vaccinated.

The DRC health ministry 1st approved use of the vaccine in pregnant and lactating women on [20 Feb 2019]. Yesterday's [Sun 2 Jun 2019] step clarifies the target population.

According to the ministry of health, from 26 Nov 2018-26 May 2019, 319 pregnant women and 603 lactating women have registered as contacts and could not be vaccinated.

As of yesterday [Sun 2 Jun 2019], 129 001 people had been vaccinated with Merck's unlicensed vaccine. Among the recipients are 35 605 high-risk contacts, 63 421 contacts of contacts, and 29 975 front-line providers.

[3] Support and response
- Tue 4 Jun 2019
[WHO / AFRO, edited]
https://www.afro.who.int/news/psychological-support-life-after-ebola

Ebola has a fatality rate of about 50%, so explaining the loss of family members and helping patients through the grieving process is a daily task for psychologists who work alongside doctors, nurses, and caregivers.

There are 5 psychologists and 11 psychosocial assistants, trained by the Danish Refugee Council and financed by UNICEF, working at the Butembo ETC.

Mental Health after Ebola
-------------------------
"Ebola is a new threat in this community. It has affected everyone's mental health. It's a disease that kills so many, and everyone is afraid of death. It also affects the economy because decontamination efforts require mattresses and other personal effects to be destroyed."

Then there is the stigmatisation. Some households have had multiple deaths in the family. The surviving family members tend to be stigmatised by the community who stop doing business with them or coming to visit.

Notes for editors
-----------------
Providing Psychological Support to Ebola patients, survivors and affected communities

Ebola is a traumatic illness both in terms of symptom severity and mortality rates. Those affected are likely to experience psychological effects due to the traumatic course of the infection, fear of death, and the experience of witnessing others dying. It can have a significant impact on the well-being of those affected, their family, community members, and the health workers treating people with Ebola.

Survivors can experience psychosocial consequences due to feelings of shame or guilt (e.g., from transmitting infection to others) and stigmatization or blame from their communities. Some have been threatened, attacked, evicted, left behind by, or excluded from, their families and communities because they were seen as tainted and dangerous. Fear and stigma of Ebola are contributed to by cultural beliefs, widespread fears due to high infection risk, lack of information, and misinformation.

WHO and partners provide financial resources, guidelines, and training materials for responders to provide humane, supportive, and practical help to communities affected by the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, DRC.

https://actualite.cd/2019/06/04/rdc-colere-paralysie-des-activites-beni-apres-les-tueries-dune-dizaine-de-personnes-par

Activities are paralyzed in the city of Beni in the aftermath of killings of at least 12 civilians by suspected ADF rebels in the Butanuka district of Beu commune.

Drivers of motorcycle taxis invaded the streets to show their anger at the death of 4 of their colleagues. Hundreds of protesters including bikers marched with 2 people to the town hall where they tore the flag of the republic before leaving.

Shops are closed and small businesses that had opened in the morning at Kilokwa Central Market also closed. The situation is similar to the Matonge shopping center in Mulekera commune.

The security system has been reinforced at the town hall. A dozen policemen and soldiers are present on site. The same system is visible at the 30 June [2019] roundabout of Beni on Nyamwisi Boulevard.

[Byline: Nellie Peyton]

[excerpt]
Working in Liberia during the Ebola outbreak in 2015, researcher Katherina Thomas noticed that while experts and aid workers had lots to say, no one was listening to ordinary people affected.

She and a team set about interviewing patients and community members about their experiences, creating an oral history archive that she believes could help responders struggling to gain the trust of Ebola-hit communities in Congo today.

"People are asking why community members don't trust the responders, but I think we should be asking why aren't we trusting them?" said Thomas, currently a writer-in-residence at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in the United States. "They don't have a seat at the table, but their voices and insights are so crucial," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

Community resistance was also a problem during the West Africa outbreak, which hit Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, and the reasons were sometimes surprising, said Thomas. She and her colleagues interviewed the young men who attacked an Ebola quarantine center in Liberia in 2014 and found they believed they were saving their community, she said.

Although the context is different in eastern Congo, an active conflict zone, Thomas said some of the insights are relevant, and she hopes to make the archive available for public use.

The Red Cross has been leading efforts to collect community feedback during the current outbreak with over 700 volunteers doing interviews by going door-to-door.

By analyzing which comments are most frequent and where, they have been able to see how perceptions of Ebola are changing and what concerns need to be addressed, said Ombretta Baggio, senior advisor for community engagement at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC).

"If you start from where they are, they listen to you differently," Baggio said of the people affected.

[4] Comment
Date: Thu 6 Jun 2019
From: Karl Johnson <microcaddis@gmail.com> [edited]

The recent report that more than half of the Ebola deaths in the current outbreak occur outside of the WHO-inspired ETCs provides data that clearly indicates that the campaign is not working, despite the use of a very successful live virus vaccine.

To change this equation, a virology test to measure Ebola antibodies in candidate healthcare personnel is the critical 1st step. Then it is time to close the ETCs that the people of the region clearly do not like, send immune personnel to all local treatment sites, and vaccinate all family members and others who have contacted patients. Only when the residents believe they will get medical attention in sites they generally use will this horrendous epidemic be finally controlled.

<microcaddis@gmail.com>

[ProMED thanks Karl Johnson for submitting his thoughts on how to turn around the current battle against Ebola in the DRC. Trust Karl Johnson to think outside the box! But the problem I see with this suggestion is the question of whether there are enough immune doctors from the region to work in local treatment centers. There are approximately 110 healthcare personnel who have been infected to date, likely because they were not vaccinated. Are they refusing vaccination, or is the vaccine not reaching them? This would have to be addressed. Alternatively, or in addition, would foreign doctors be accepted in the local centers? I am not sure. It may just bring us back to the same issue of distrust of outsiders by the locals. But I think it is worth trying, along with working directly with the communities, to change the environment of distrust. - Mod.LK
