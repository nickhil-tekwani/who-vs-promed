Health authorities [Servicio Departamental de Salud; Department Health Services, SEDES] from the Beni [department -- state equivalent] suspect that the 1st case of West Nile virus [infection] was reported in that territory. A young man from the Magdalena community presented with symptoms [encephalitis?] at the beginning of 2012, and was laboratory confirmed in past days.

"It was thought that this was a case of dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF], but the [test] results were positive for St. Louis [encephalitis virus]. We will continue investigating; it could be a cross-reaction [with other flaviviruses], but for now, we have this result," said the Beni SEDES epidemiologist, Wilfredo Camargo to Radio Fides. The St. Louis encephalitis virus is transmitted by mosquitoes in the USA and is related to West Nile virus.

The health authority explained that a team from the health department will go to the Magdalena community, place of residence of the young man who was infected by the bite of _Culex pipiens_, an abundant mosquito in the lowlands. The team will carry out field work to determine if there is a population of [virus] infected mosquitoes. "We must do corresponding follow-up in the environment where the young man lives and take [blood?] samples from other patients so that we can know if the virus is circulating there or not," he stated.

West Nile virus [causes] a virus infection transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause serious brain inflammation. The symptoms are headache, fever, fatigue, abdominal pain, and diarrhea; if serious, it can be fatal.

In August [2012], La Razon published a report about West Nile virus and the anticipated actions being taken by national health authorities. At that time, they announced that personnel are trained to report any suspected [case] so that an epidemiological barrier can be established immediately.

The Director of the Beni SEDES, Cesar Lijeron, stated that he did not know about the case, but during the day he will request an epidemiological report to implement sanitary measures if the report confirms it.

[This report lacks the specific information necessary to confirm the etiology of the case mentioned. The type of test used that was positive for St. Louis encephalitis virus is not mentioned, but presumably was a serological one. Apparently, West Nile virus (WNV) is suspected based on a positive results for the related St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV). As the report points out, there are cross reactions among related flaviviruses in serological tests, which were the tests probably used in this case. The reason for excluding St. Louis encephalitis virus infection as a possible etiological agent in this case is not mentioned, although that virus, as well as WNV, occurs in neighboring Argentina.

ProMED-mail would be interested in receiving information about the test used and results of the follow-up work that is planned to determine which flavivirus might have been involved in that reported case, or if other people in the community have serological evidence of flavivirus infections.

ProMED has not previously reported either SLEV or WNV presence in Bolivia. It would also be of interest to know if the young man survived his encephalitis. It is curious that the Director of SEDES did not know about the case.

The Beni is subject to seasonal flooding in August- October. Mosquito populations in lowland areas currently may have little relationship to those this past January (2012) when the case occurred. However, isolation of viruses from mosquitoes in the area where the case occurred would be of interest. - Mod.TY
