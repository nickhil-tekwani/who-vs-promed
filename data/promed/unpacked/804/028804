Mystery disease wiping out pomegranate crops
--------------------------------------------
A mysterious disease is wiping out pomegranate orchards in all states except the Northern Territory and Tasmania.

[A grower] in north-west Victoria has lost 80 percent of his crop this year [2013]. He derives most of his income from pomegranates and says the situation is so bad, some farmers will have to bulldoze their trees.

"Most of (the trees) have still got fruit on them but the leaves have all gone yellow and they just fall off virtually overnight," he said. "The fruit, whilst it still goes red, doesn't mature inside, so it's worthless. Within 3 weeks, the trees are completely dead."

[A number of dieback diseases of pomegranate have been reported. The diebacks have been found to be associated with either of several fungal pathogens, insect attacks, environmental factors, or their causes have remained undiagnosed so far.

For example, in the USA, a dieback of undiagnosed cause was reported to have affected Californian pomegranate trees from around 2008 with around 40 percent yield loss, where some trees remain healthy while adjacent ones die (see link below). It is uncertain whether there may be any relationship to the dieback problems in Australia.
