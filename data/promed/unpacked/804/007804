The mass death of chickens and ducks on a small island next to the US
Army's missile testing range in the Marshall Islands is perplexing
health and environment officials.

The sudden and unexplained deaths of nearly 100 chickens on Enibooj
Island -- which has a population of less than 200 people living a
largely subsistence lifestyle -- sparked an investigation earlier this
week by Ministry of Health and Marshall Islands Environmental
Protection Authority [EPA] officials.

"More than 85 chickens and ducks were found dead and buried on the
island of Enibooj from 1 Jul to 18 Jul 2011," reported Ebeye
Hospital's Dr Tom Jack and EPA's Ebeye chief environmental specialist
Odrikawa Jatios on Wednesday [20 Jul 2011] after touring the island
that US cartographers refer to as Carlson. Samples of the dead bird
carcasses were taken for laboratory testing.

Kwajalein [Atoll] senator Tony deBrum sought an investigation of the
apparent outbreak of disease among fowls on the island late last week,
saying "dead chickens in a small community should be a matter of
emergency health concerns."

The island is located about 3 miles away from the headquarters island
of the Reagan Test Site, a major missile testing facility operated by
the US Army.

"No person was sick during this period of time and no other animals
were sick besides chickens and ducks," said Jack and Jatios. "It is
not clear what caused the death of the chickens on Enibooj." The
problem appears to have subsided, they said.

They have asked the Marshall Islands Quarantine Department and the
Army's Animal Hospital Laboratory to assess what caused the outbreak.

People on the island said the unknown sickness hit the fowls without
warning earlier this month [July 2011]. The birds' eyelids swelled up,
some flipped upside down with legs in the air and died, while others
died of dehydration even though water was available for the animals.
Mostly young chickens -- from 2 months to a year old -- died in the
outbreak.

Enibooj islanders say no commercial feed was used for the chickens and
no pesticides are in use on the island. "All interviewees said other
animals like pigs and dogs are drinking from the same water source but
were never sick (and didn't) die," Jatios said.

Dr Jack advised residents not to eat island chickens until further
notice and showed how to properly dispose of them. He also advised
against sending chickens to Ebeye, the urban center on Kwajalein Atoll
that has a population of about 12 000.

The 2 investigators said they witnessed one chicken in the process of
dying from the mystery illness while on the island. "The chicken's
eyelids were swelling and it couldn't walk," the report said. "The
chicken will sit for almost 2 days and then it dies."

[What an odd sounding disease. For the disease to have come and gone
so quickly makes me think of a couple of things. Did a weather pattern
blow in some insects that carried a disease? If it was a water borne
toxin, then the chickens were clearly the most sensitive animals
around. If it is a virus, it is host adapted to the chicken.

A proper necropsy and testing should help shed some light on this. -
