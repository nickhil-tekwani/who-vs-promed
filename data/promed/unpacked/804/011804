Nineteen human rabies cases have been reported in France from 1968 to 1997.
Eighteen
were imported, one was a corneal graft taken from an egyptian patient,
[infected in Egypt and who died in France (1979).
The imported cases were as follows:
Year Country of Origin
1970 Niger
1973 Gabon
1976 Gabon, Algieria X 2, Morocco
1977 Gabon, Morocco
1979 Egypt (and corneal graft)
1980 Tunisia
1982 Senegal
1991 Mexico
1992 Algeria
1994 Mali
1996 Madagascar, Algeria X 2
1997 India

The case from 1994 was a 46-year-old man from Mali, contaminated during a
summer holiday in Mali. He did not receive any post-exposure treatment and
died on his return to France. He was HIV+, and had 70 CD4 cells when he
died (in a hospital in the Val de Marne). Rabies diagnosis was suspected
but established only postmortem. Thirty-six post-exposure treatments were
given to hospital staff and family members.
The case from 1997 was a 52-year-old female, bitten in India, near Goa, by
a rabid dog [while on a 2 week holiday tour. She received tissue culture
vaccines in India, but no RIG. The multiple wounds were sutured. Back in
France, she [received follow-up injections but began to feel paresthesia
at the site of the wounds 12 days after the bite. She died 49 days after
the bite. Rabies antigens were found intra-vitam on saliva, cutaneous
biopsy and CSF. Fifty post-exposure treatments were given to family
members and hospital staff. As the rabies risk in France (1 bat in 1997, 0
wild animal and 0 domestic animal since October, 1996) and western Europe
is decreasing, Europeans seem to forget or are unaware of the risk when
they travel in [countries where rabies is known to be endemic. The number
of post-exposure treatments given to travellers on their return is
increasing in the Rabies Treatment Center in the Pasteur Institute. We
think that information on rabies and pre-exposure vaccination should be
part of the pre-travel medical evaluation.
