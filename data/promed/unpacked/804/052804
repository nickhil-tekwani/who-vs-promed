Monthly Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Statistics; As of Mon 1 Mar 2004
--------------------------------------------------
The Department of Health issued on Mon 1 Mar 2004 the latest information
about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. This
includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease [abbreviated in
ProMED-mail as vCJD or CJD (new var.)] -- the form of the disease thought
to be linked to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). The position is as
follows:

The next monthly statistics will be published on Mon 5 Apr 2004.

-- ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org> [Since the previous monthly statistics released by the Department of Health on Mon 2 Feb 2004, the total number of definite or probable vCJD cases (dead and alive) and the number of deaths remain unchanged, and the number of deaths attributed to sporadic CJD has increased by 10. In view of the experimental evidence from transmission experiments in mice reported by Asante et al. (MRC Prion Unit, University College, London) in the EMBO Journal, Vol. 21, No. 23, 6358-6368, 2002 <http://emboj.oupjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/21/23/6358?etoc>, that: "Some patients with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD may have a disease arising from BSE exposure" (see: CJD, possible association with BSE 20021129.5921), the figures for sporadic CJD cases now have added significance in relation to the course of the vCJD outbreak and will continued to be presented here. vCJD has been recognized to date only in individuals homozygous for methionine at PRNP codon 129, and Asante et al. reported that transgenic mice expressing human PrP methionine 129, inoculated with either bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or variant CJD prions, may develop the neuropathological and molecular phenotype of vCJD, consistent with these diseases being caused by the same prion strain. However, BSE transmission to these transgenic mice, in addition to producing a vCJD-like phenotype, also resulted in a distinct molecular phenotype that was indistinguishable from that of sporadic CJD with PrP\Sc type 2. These data suggest that more than one BSE-derived prion strain might infect humans; it is therefore possible that some patients with a phenotype consistent with sporadic CJD may have a disease arising from BSE exposure. - Mod.CP] ****** [2] Date: Mon 5 Jan 2004 From: ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org> Source: Eurosurveillance Weekly, Volume 8 / Issue 6, Thu 5 Jan 2004 [edited] <http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2004/040205.asp> Incidence of Variant CJD in the UK Shows Evidence of Having Peaked or Reached a Plateau -------------------------------------------------- A total of 18 deaths from variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) were reported in 2003 in the United Kingdom. The greatest number of deaths reported in any one year was 28 in the year 2000. This fell to 20 in 2001 and 17 in 2002. At the end of 2003, the overall total number of deaths from vCJD was 139 with a further 6 probable cases alive. The quarterly analysis of vCJD incidence published on the CJD surveillance unit website (<http://www.cjd.ed.ac.uk/vcjdq.htm>) shows that the incidence of deaths since 1994 is consistent with an underlying trend that has either reached a peak or a plateau. As was first noted in 2003 (refs. 1,2), the data are not consistent with an underlying trend that is increasing exponentially. Quadratic and plateau models for vCJD deaths incidence trend are presented as a figure in the original article. These 2 models fit the data equally well. The quadratic model estimates that a peak in deaths occurred at the end of 2000 and that the current incidence is 3.5 deaths per quarter. An extrapolation of this model gives a prediction of 11 deaths for 2004 (95 percent prediction interval of 4 to 19). The plateau model estimates the current incidence to be 4.9 deaths per quarter and predicts 19 deaths in 2004 (95 percent prediction interval 10 to 29). The interpretation of these results requires caution, as highlighted by the difference in the predictions from 2 models that fit the current data equally well. There may be a long tail or more than one peak to the epidemic. There is also the theoretical possibility of human-to-human spread through procedures such as blood transfusions: one such potential case was recently reported in the UK (ref. 3). Continued surveillance and research into vCJD is therefore important to investigate these possibilities. References: (1) Andrews N, Molesworth A.

Authors: C Herzog, N Sales, N Etchegaray, A Charbonnier, S Freire, D Dormont, J-P Deslys and C I Lasmezas. (Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique, Departement de Recherche Medicale, BP6, 92265 Fontenay-aux-Roses, Cedex, France) Abstract: The disease-associated form of prion protein (PrP/res) has been noted in lymphoreticular tissues in patients with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Thus, the disease could be transmitted iatrogenically by surgery or use of blood products. We aimed to assess transmissibility of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) agent to primates by the intravenous route and study its tissue distribution compared with infection by the oral route. Cynomolgus macaques were infected either intravenously or orally with brain homogenates from first-passage animals with BSE. They were clinically monitored for occurrence of neurological signs and killed humanely at the terminal stage of the disease. Brain, lymphoreticular tissues, digestive tract, and peripheral nerves were obtained and analysed by sandwich ELISA and immunohistochemistry for quantitative and qualitative assessment of their PrP/res content. Incubation periods after intravenous transmission of BSE were much shorter than after oral infection. We noted that PrP/res was present in lymphoreticular tissues such as spleen and tonsils and in the entire gut from the duodenum to the rectum. In the gut, PrP/res was present in Peyer's patches and in the enteric nervous system and nerve fibres of intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, PrP/res was found in locomotor peripheral nerves and the autonomic nervous system. Amount of PrP/res ranged from 0.02 percent to more than 10 percent of that recorded in brain. Distribution of PrP/res was similar in animals infected by the intravenous or oral route. Our findings suggest that the possible risk of vCJD linked to endoscopic procedures might be currently underestimated. Human iatrogenic vCJD cases infected intravenously raise the same public-health concerns as primary cases and need the same precautionary measures with respect to blood and tissue donations and surgical procedures. -- ProMED-mail <promed@promedmail.org>
