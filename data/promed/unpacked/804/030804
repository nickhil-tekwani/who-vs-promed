Residents in the village of Malimpung, District Patampanua Pinrang, South Sulawesi [province], have symptoms of anthrax disease. One of the residents of Malimpung is now in intensive care in Lasinrang hospital with the disease. 43 head of cattle and buffalo died suddenly in the village of Malimpung since mid-February [2016]. Anthrax also attacked a number of residents in some locations.

The resident of Pelita hamlet, Malimpung village, was taken to the hospital with symptoms of anthrax disease that attacks cattle as well as citizens around the house. In addition to experiencing high fever, headache, nausea, and vomiting, he also suffered a number of wounds all over his body that resemble the symptoms of anthrax. He felt sick since Saturday [5 Mar 2016].

He was taken to the health center. However, because his condition did not improve and wounds on his body increased, he had to be take to Lasinrang hospital in Pinrang.

He said that he had been in direct contact with the blood of cattle whose carcasses had tested positive for anthrax. "I had time to help a neighbor slaughter animals with anthrax before the carcass was removed," he said when we met in the hospital emergency room lounge at Lasinrang, Pinrang, on Friday [11 Mar 2016].

A neighbor of [the patient] experienced quite a lot of livestock deaths. [The patient was] called to help lift and move the carcass of the cow. Prior to disposal, the dying cows were slaughtered by their owners.

Health Officer IGD RUD Lasinrang Pinrang Agussalim said [the patient's] conditions were almost certainly from anthrax. Now the medical team is investigating and checking the condition of the patient's, confirmed the disease as a result of transmission of the bacterium _Bacillus anthracis_. "The symptoms that exist in these patients, together with symptoms of anthrax disease. [The patient] also had a history of physical contact with the cow infected with anthrax," said Agussalim.

According to Agussalim, Lasinrang hospitals also had received 2 other patients suspected of having similar symptoms. In addition to experiencing high fever, nausea, vomiting and dizziness, patients also suffered injuries that arise in the body. The foot of a patient who was directly contaminated with the blood of carcasses infected with anthrax also appeared to have black spots.

Animal Health Officer I Gede Adhika Priyamanaya says anthrax can be transmitted to humans who come into contact with the carcasses of animals with anthrax. The symptoms of anthrax disease can also be seen in humans who have been eating meat containing anthrax [organisms], including diarrhea and vomiting shortly after eating the meat.

The patient is now receiving intensive care in hospital and hopes to recover soon.

[This report provides some human dimensions to the previous report. But it would seem that diagnosis depends more on symptoms than laboratory confirmation.
