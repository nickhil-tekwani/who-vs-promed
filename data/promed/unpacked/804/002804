The Guatemalan health authorities increased the "red alert" to 9 departments
of the interior of the country due to more than 134 000 cases of diarrhea
and some 165 [cases of cholera, 3 of which were fatal, due to the severe
flooding provoked by the rains of this year.
The departments of Escuintla (south) with 48 944 [cases, Santa Rosa
(southeast) with 16 729 [cases and San Marcos (northwest) with 14 099
[cases, were the departments most affected by diarrhea, according to the
chief of Epidemiology of the Ministry of Health, Mario Gudiel.
In these regions there have also been reported 11, 5 and 12 cases of cholera
respectively.
In the departments northwest of Totonicapan and Quiche there were 3 persons
who died from cholera and another 55 cases [of cholera, while 21 460
suffered from diarrhea, according to the official [Dr. Mario Gudiel.
According to the source, in Retalhuleu and Suchitepequez, on the south
coast, there were 15 422 persons with diarrhea and another 57 with cholera.
Meanwhile, in Izabal, on the Atlantic coast, there were 7263 cases of
