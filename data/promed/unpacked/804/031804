Veterinary authorities yesterday quarantined two Sydney chicken farms after
an outbreak of a deadly bird disease that is threatening the nation's $2
billion poultry industry and local wildlife. Chickens suffering symptoms of
the infectious Newcastle disease, mainly found in northern Asia, were found
in two flocks of about 100 000 birds in Blacktown and Glenorie.
CSIRO scientists at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong
yesterday confirmed the presence of the disease and the country's most
senior State vets held an emergency telephone conference with national chief
veterinary officer Dr Gardner Murray throughout the day.
An Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service spokesman said while tests
still had to determine the exact strain of the disease, some of the affected
birds had already died and rest would probably have to be destroyed. A NSW
Agriculture spokesman said the [ORIGIN] of the disease had not been
determined but may have come from migratory birds. The spokesman said
no links had been established between the two farms but the disease
may have been carried on trucks, through birds or eggs.
Veterinarian for major supplier Red Lea Chickens, based at Blacktown, Ben
Wells said while none of the company's chickens had been affected he hoped
the State and federal governments would act quickly to eradicate the outbreak.
[This is potentially catastrphic for the Australian poultry industry
-- up to now Australia has been free of ND.
