[I am grateful to Richard Brown for the following suggested explanation of
the term "hygiene dead spots". - Mod.SH]
I worked in Hong Kong as a government vet for over 3 years, 1990 to 1993
and on a couple of occasions went into China. I am guessing but "hygiene
dead spots" may well be areas, usually corners inside a building or a cul
de sac in streets. These areas are "homeostatically stable" with detritus.
No person wants to go into these spots or clean them because they know not
what they in turn will pick up in the way of infections and the dead spot
has an almost miraculous way of ressurecting itself in 3 months. So why
bother? No sane person is going to wander into these spots to get infected.
Chinese colleagues may well shed light on the exact words used. There is a
very good chance that the words are in fact a pun. The Cantonese have a
good sense of humour. A description of a mother in law often comes out in
direct translation as "a main battlegroup aircraft carrier" -- that is, a
ship against which you do not stand a chance and with which you should not
mess around,..... a wife is simply "the tigress".
