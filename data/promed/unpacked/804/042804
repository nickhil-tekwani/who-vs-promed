Two more cases of the Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which
has already claimed 3 lives in Ahmedabad in the past fortnight, were
detected on Friday [21 Jan 2011], taking the number of confirmed
cases to 5. While one of them is the husband of CCHF's 1st victim,
the 2nd is a male nurse at Shalby Hospital, where patients of the
near-fatal infection were treated earlier.

The National Institute of Virology in Pune has confirmed that the
23-year-old male nurse, working in Shalby Hospital, has been infected
with the virus.

[Previously, it was reported that a patient, an attending physician,
and an intensive care nurse had succumbed to CCHF virus infection.
The husband of the victim was being treated at the same hospital. It
now transpires that this patient and another nurse have died from the
same infection.

The mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30 percent, with death
occurring in the 2nd week of illness. In those patients who recover,
improvement generally begins on the 9th or 10th day after the onset
of illness. When patients with CCHF are admitted to hospital, there
is a risk of nosocomial spread of infection. In the past, serious
outbreaks have occurred in this way, and it is imperative that
adequate infection control measures be observed to prevent this
disastrous outcome, such as the present incident. Patients with
suspected or confirmed CCHF should be isolated and cared for using
barrier nursing techniques. [For further information, see:

[2] Presence in ticks

The virus causing the deadly Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF)
has been found "in high quantities" in ticks collected from parts of
Ahmedabad [Gujarat state]. Ticks infected don't die of it, unlike
humans, but actually facilitate transmission [of the virus]. This has
made scientists from the National Institute of Virology [HIV] (Pune)
believe that the virus is now openly circulating in the environment
and has not been brought into India from other CCHF endemic countries.

Director of NIV Dr A C Mishra told TOI [Times of India] that 2 pools
of ticks (20 ticks) collected from the area, which has reported
positive cases of CCHF for the 1st time in India among humans, "had
very high viral content."

"We are trying to answer the question as to whether the virus has
been moving around in our environment or has it been introduced
newly. After testing, we have found that a particular variety
[species] of tick, [belonging to the genus] _Hyalomma_, which is
known to act as a vector of several diseases, was carrying the
CCHF-causing virus in high quantities. This leads us to believe that
the virus is now present in our environment and might not have been imported."

Entomologists had collected 274 ticks from the affected village and
Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation area and sent them to NIV, Pune, and
the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal. Around 15
rodent samples have also been sent to the Bhopal lab.

_Hyalomma_ is a genus of hard-bodied ticks common in Asia, Europe and
North Africa. Their bites cause the surrounding tissue to die and
become necrotic. It is well adapted to living in arid biotopes. They
have long been credited with spreading the virus that causes the life
threatening CCHF, says entomologists.

Dr Mishra added: "We have picked up samples from domesticated cattle
to see if they are infected with the virus. Animals can be infected,
but they don't die of it. They just harbour the virus much like the
ticks which act as a reservoir. If the virus is present in the
cattle, it could have spread from them. Cutting meat infected with
the virus could lead to its spread to humans." These ticks can
circulate the virus in the environment for many years.

Dr Mishra said, "The tick lays its eggs and transfers the virus into
it. The egg hatches and grows into a tick and continues to infect
animals. We are trying to see if there is a particular hotspot of
this virus, or is it spread across a large area? We are also trying
to analyse how long this virus has been in our country. We are also
going to analyse the strains with a global database to pin its type."

The Delhi-based National Centre for Disease Control is strengthening
its capacity to test for CCHF virus. The [polymerase chain reaction]
primers have been developed, and testing samples will be started in 2 days.

Meanwhile, the Gujarat government has a stock of about 1000 tablets
of the drug Ribavirin. Research done earlier by NIV found the virus
in animals in several parts of India including Rajasthan. The
antibodies against the virus were clearly identified. The ministry's
report states that: "There is serological evidence of this infection
being present in India in animals who do not get [suffer from] the
disease." The NIV report says: "The Gujarat government has been told
about [the presence of the haemorrhagic fever virus] and to keep a
look out for it." The report further says: "Within 15 hours of
receipt of the clinical sample, the hospital authorities were
informed that a highly infectious virus is the etiological agent. The
hospital was told to put in place strict infection control practices.
It was told that disposal of waste material from the patient should
be handled with great caution and that use of facemasks and the
isolation of patients were essential. Use of Ribavirin,!
an antiviral drug, was also recommended."

[This is the 1st official confirmation that Crimean-Congo
haemarrhagic fever virus is present (and probably endemic) in northern India.
