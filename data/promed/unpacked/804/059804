STRANGLES, HORSES - USA (LOUISIANA)
***********************************
A ProMED-mail post

From: Martin Hugh-Jones <mehj2020@vt8200.vetmed.lsu.edu>

In late October a USDA/FSIS veterinarian went with a friend to the
'Adopt-a-horse' program laid on in Natchitoches, LA, hoping to buy one of
the horses there thanks to the US Bureau of Land Management who were
disposing of horses out of Nebraska. However, she noted that a number
were demonstrating obvious clinical signs of strangles (due to
_Streptococcus equi_). Being a poultry inspector she asked her
veterinarian, Dr John (Rusty) Berry, to check the horses out himself.
This Dr Berry did, confirmed the diagnosis, and immediately informed the
State Veterinarian Dr Mack Lee. As a result Dr Lee arranged for the 24
remaining unsold horses to be returned to Elm Creek, NB, on or about 26th
October instead of them being passed on to their next place scheduled to be
in Tennessee, and warned Nebraska of their condition.
In his practice out of Boyce, LA, Berry has seen and diagnosed strangles in
another of these horses that had been purchased by a ranch in Tioga;
subsequently the ranch manager "diagnosed" five more affected horses on the
farm and treated them himself. On other farms in the area Dr Berry has
diagnosed ten further cases, none were Nebraska horses but had been stabled
with or tied next to such newly purchased horses. He says that there is
now a raging "strangles" scare in the Alexandria area, fueled by the feed
stores selling antibiotics to owners of horses that are coming down with
the usual Fall incidence of upper respiratory virus infections typical for
this time of year, as well as to owners of horses that may have
_Streptoccus equi_ infections and clinical strangles. The true extent of
this apparently introduced _S. equi_ infection is obscure.
In talking with Dr Lee about this, he made clear that these horses from
Nebraska had arrived with all the necessary health certificates.
Unfortunately, this year as in others neither his office nor that of the
USDA/APHIS/VS had been warned of their coming, in spite of his requests,
and so it was impossible to have a veterinarian in attendance at the
"Adopt-a-horse" show.
For those veterinarians in other countries where antibiotics for sick
animals can only be obtained on prescription who may be a bit puzzled...,
yes, this country is bizarre but that is the way it is, unfortunately.
[I appreciate the help and information given to me by Drs Berry & Lee. -

[Thanks much, Martin for this enlightening tale. Although the animals had
health certificates, and left Nebraska in apparent good health but with a
shedder of this equine shipping fever in the group. Stress, tiredness, and
close contact would do the rest. It would seem prudent for many reasons,
to have an APHIS veterinarian in attendance. It is important that good
programs such as Adopt-A-Horse don't end up spreading disease and killing
animals. Thus, they should have definite provisions for veterinary
examinations at appropriate venues as the horse moves from federal custody
to home on a farm. As this outbreak shows, a careful clinical veterinary
inspection at the sale would have been most useful. - Mod.PC]
