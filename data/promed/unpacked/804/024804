Reliable sources report that ["peste bovine;" see comment] has been raging for 2 months in [the village] Lenguere Katiya in the rural town of Fafaya, Prefecture Koubia. So far, 9 people and nearly 120 animals have died, and there are 20 sick people.

Speaking of the origin of the epidemic, our sources say the people of this village have eaten the meat of animals infected with the plague. We are informed that local authorities went to the location for fact finding.

"The disease has been reported here for 2 months, but the information reached us on 22 May 2014. While 9 children have died, there is also information on the deaths of 60 sheep, 50 goats, 2 bulls and 6 cows. In addition, 20 people are seriously ill," said Elhadj Mamadou Dian, vice-prefect of Fafaya, who was interviewed by a local radio station.

Patients whose condition is serious were transported to the regional hospital in Koubia where they are receiving intensive care.

[The French text mentions "peste bovine" (rinderpest) as the disease affecting the animals. This seems highly unlikely: on top of the fact that rinderpest is known to have been globally eradicated (though should not be neglected for differential diagnosis purposes), this morbillivirus rarely affected sheep/goats and is not zoonotic [does not affect humans].

Another report on the same event, dated 25 May 2014, is available at http://www.africaguinee.com/articles/2014/05/25/peste-bovine-plusieurs-morts-signales-koubia. According to this machine translated report, which similarly mentions "peste bovine" as the disease in the animals _and_ humans, the clinical signs observed in the affected persons included "pimples [French, "boutons"] on the face, inflammation, diarrhea, followed by death" (over 3 victims within 2 days).

According to the (rather blurred) available information, the zoonotic infectious diseases which deserve consideration in this event are anthrax and (less likely) Rift valley fever.

Fafaya is a town and sub-prefecture in the Koubia Prefecture in northern Guinea. For a map showing the location of Koubia prefecture, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:GN-Koubia.png.

Guinea has suffered during 2014 Ebola outbreaks (map at http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/resources/distribution-map-guinea-outbreak.html); no cases have been reported from the Koubia prefecture. However, in case the animal disease in Koubia is found to be unrelated to the human epidemic, Ebola should be excluded.

Results of the epidemiological and laboratory investigations, hopefully to be performed cooperatively by public health and veterinary authorities, are anticipated with interest. - Mod.AS
