A health alert has been issued after a rabid bat was found in Dorset.

Public Health England has urged GPs [general practitioners: medical doctors] to consider rabies injections for any patients exposed to bats, following the case.

Officials said the European bat lyssavirus 1 [EBLV-1] was detected in a dead serotine bat found in Dorset, and that it was the 1st time this particular virus has ever been confirmed in the UK.

The bat rabies virus is "related to the classical rabies virus and can lead to clinical rabies in humans."

Officials advised that "any person exposed to any type of bat in the UK should receive a prompt risk assessment and may require post-exposure treatment with rabies vaccine".

Exposure means a bite, scratch, or contact with bat saliva.

Every year, around 150 people in England receive NHS [National Health Service] treatment after being bitten by a bat.

PHE [Public Health England] said the "risk of catching rabies from a bat is very low".

[European bat lyssaviruses constitute a separate group of lyssaviruses. Infections by European bat lyssavirus type 1 (EBLV-1) appear to be the most prevalent variant, and have been reported in bats and humans in Northern Europe. Within this group there is a further division into subtypes (genotypes) 1 and 2. Phylogenetic analysis has identified 2 lineages within the EBLV-1 genotype, supported by geographical separation. EBLV-1a is distributed over northern Europe between the Netherlands and Russia, whilst EBLV-1b is found only in Western Europe along an axis from Spain to the Netherlands. This is why it was expected to be present in the UK. Deeper analyses should confirm whether the virus found is EBLV-1a or EBLV-1b. - Mod.PMB
