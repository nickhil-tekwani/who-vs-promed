More detections of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2 (RHDV2) in a wild rabbit have been confirmed by the Oregon Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, one in a black-tailed jackrabbit recovered from Powell Butte in Crook County on [13 Dec 2021]. Winter is the most popular time of the year to hunt rabbits and hunters are asked to keep an eye out for the disease and take steps to avoid spreading it. Owners of domestic rabbits should also take precautions.

RHDV2 is a virus that causes sudden death in rabbits. The virus only infects rabbits and poses no human health risk. But it poses a high risk for domestic, feral, and wild rabbits.

Oregon Department of Agriculture [ODA] and ODFW [Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife] are working together to monitor the disease and to try and limit its spread since it was first detected in Oregon in feral domestic rabbits near Portland in mid-March 2021.

The first known mortality from RHDV2 in a wild rabbit occurred in a black-tailed jackrabbit found dead near Rome, Oregon, in Malheur County in April 2021. (This case was only confirmed in December 2021.) The second was confirmed in a wild black-tailed jackrabbit collected in May 2021 near Christmas Valley, Oregon, in Lake County. This latest detection in Crook County is about 70 miles [about 113 km] from the Christmas Valley case and less than 50 miles [about 80 km] from a detection by ODA in feral domestic and domestic rabbits in La Pine, Oregon.

The virus can withstand high and low temperatures and persists for long periods in decaying carcasses on the landscape. Transmission is often through direct contact but can also be spread through excretions, via contaminated water or food, and through contaminated objects or clothing.

Signs of the disease in rabbits may include respiratory or neurologic symptoms as well as bloody nasal discharge and sudden death. Often, a deceased animal with a bloody nose is seen without other obvious external signs of injury. (Rabbits that have clear evidence of trauma, such as being caught by a cat or hit by a car, are not usually tested for the virus.)

While this virus can be deadly and contagious to rabbits and hares, in 2 of the 3 wild rabbit cases in Oregon, just a single dead rabbit was identified instead of multiple dead rabbits. Dead rabbits may be rapidly scavenged by other animals and the camouflaged coloration of wild rabbit fur makes them difficult to see in the field, so it's very possible more wild rabbits have died from the virus.

To report suspicious wild rabbit mortalities, call the Wildlife Health reporting hotline at 1-866-968-2600 or e-mail at <wildlife.health@odfw.oregon.gov>.

[In the 1980s, the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_) populations were devastated by a virus that caused an extremely lethal and highly contagious disease, rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD). The first outbreak of this new disease was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China within a group of commercially-bred Angora rabbits imported from Germany. As the virus spread worldwide, naturally occurring RHD outbreaks were reported in geographically distant regions, such as Cuba, Uruguay, and Reunion Island.

RHD is a highly pathogenic lagovirus endemic in Europe and Australasian populations of the European rabbit, _O. cuniculus_. It has also caused several unexplained disease outbreaks in domestic European rabbits in North America. The disease has also spilled to wild cottontail rabbits and jackrabbits.

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and high mortality (70-90%) in European rabbits, and spreads very rapidly by direct and indirect transmission. Infection can occur by nasal, conjunctival or oral routes.

Transmission of RHD is facilitated by the high stability of the virus in the environment. Lesions are primary liver necrosis and a massive disseminated intravascular coagulopathy in all organs and tissues. The most severe lesions are in the liver, trachea and lungs.

In 2010, a new genotype of RHD (RHD-2) emerged and where it propagated it replaced the original strain. This new variant causes lethal infections also in juvenile (< 2 month old) and RHD vaccinated rabbits. After its 1st detection in France, RHD-2 spread rapidly and infections were reported in several European countries, North America, the Middle East, and Australia. - Mod.PMB
