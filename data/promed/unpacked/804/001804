A doctor in Houston, Texas, has warned that a powerful strain of pink eye that lasts for weeks is spreading in the city. Dr. Allan Panzer, an optometrist in Houston, told Fox 7 that one patient a month usually visits his office complaining of pink eye. But recently he has seen 4 patients a day suffering from this type of pink eye, or conjunctivitis.

He told Newsweek: "I have spoken to 2 other local doctors who have seen some extreme cases lately." He added that the virus was not the "usual garden variety."

Viruses are the most common cause of pink eye, but the strain in Houston is causing worse symptoms than usual, which can last up to 3 weeks, said Panzer. Generally, both viral and bacterial forms of conjunctivitis will pass on their own within 7--14 days.

Conjunctivitis is highly contagious and can spread easily from person to person. Allen urged Houstonians to practice good hygiene by covering their mouth when they cough or sneeze and to wash in hot water soft furnishings like pillows and sheets of those infected.

A spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services told Newsweek conjunctivitis is not a notifiable condition in the state, so there is no way of tracking cases. Panzer told Newsweek the spike in cases was not an "outbreak" and that Houstonians should not be too worried.

Pink eye happens when the conjunctiva, or the thin tissue that lines the eyelid and white of the eyeball, becomes inflamed. Conjunctivitis can cause uncomfortable symptoms, such as redness, itching, and a gritty sensation in the eyes. It is also common for a discharge to form, which can crust over at night, making it difficult to open the eye in the morning.

[A patient] told Fox 7 he woke up 2 weeks ago with the feeling of a foreign object in his eye, which he is still suffering from. As pink eye is generally caused by a virus, it is not treatable with antibiotics, which can kill only bacteria. And even in cases when pink eye is caused by bacteria, antibiotics most often are not needed.

In fact, antibiotics can make matters worse by making eyes itchy and causing stinging, burning, swelling, redness, and more discharge, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology. A study published last year [2017] showed most people with pink eye get the wrong treatment, as around 60% of doctors prescribe antibiotic eye drops even though they are rarely necessary. However, those who experience extreme symptoms, have a weak immune system, or do not see their problems pass in a week without treatment should visit their doctor.

Just like other viral and bacterial infections, the best way to stop the spread of conjunctivitis is to wash hands, particularly before and after treating a sick person. Avoid touching or rubbing the eyes, and do not share personal items like makeup.

[Conjunctivitis is an inflammation or swelling of the conjunctiva, the thin transparent layer of tissue that lines the inner surface of the eyelid and covers the white part of the eye. Often called "pink eye," conjunctivitis is a common eye disease, especially in children. It may affect one or both eyes. Some forms of conjunctivitis are highly contagious and can easily spread in schools and at home. Although conjunctivitis is usually a minor eye infection, sometimes it can develop into a more serious problem.

The 3 most common causes of conjunctivitis are viral, bacterial, and allergic; it is most likely these cases are infectious conjunctivitis caused by either bacteria or virus.

Bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection most often caused by staphylococcal or streptococcal bacteria from your own skin or respiratory system. Common bacterial pathogens in children include _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, nontypeable _Haemophilus influenzae; and the most common pathogen in adults, _Staphylococcus aureus_. Other bacterial pathogens: _Staphylococcus_ species, _Moraxella_ species, _Neisseria gonorrhoeae_, gram-negative organisms (e.g., _Escherichia coli_), _Pseudomonas_ species. _N gonorrhoeae_ and _Chlamydia trachomatis_ may also cause red eye and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Insects, physical contact with other people, poor hygiene (touching the eye with unclean hands), or using contaminated eye makeup and facial lotions can also cause the infection. Sharing makeup and wearing contact lenses that are not your own or are improperly cleaned can also cause bacterial conjunctivitis.

Viral conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by contagious viruses associated with the common cold. Adenovirus (family Adenoviridae) is the most common viral cause. The adenovirus is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus. Other viral causes include enterovirus, Coxsackievirus, VZV, Epstein-Barr virus, HSV, influenza. _Herpes zoster_ is also a more serious possibility.

It can develop through exposure to the coughing or sneezing of someone with an upper respiratory tract infection. Viral conjunctivitis can also occur as the virus spreads along the body's own mucous membranes, which connect the lungs, throat, nose, tear ducts, and conjunctiva. Because the tears drain into the nasal passageway, forceful nose blowing can cause a virus to move from your respiratory system to your eyes.
