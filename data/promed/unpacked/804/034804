The province of Huesca has registered a community outbreak of whooping cough [pertussis] in the past week, with 15 cases so far in 2 adults and 13 children aged between 1 month and 7 years.

According to the Aragon weekly epidemiological bulletin, published Thursday [16 Sep 2022], 4 of the cases were laboratory-confirmed and the rest with compatible clinical and epidemiological links.

Most of those affected were not vaccinated, and one of them required hospital admission. In addition, the mothers of 2 cases aged 1 and 3 months had not received the vaccine during pregnancy, according to the bulletin.

The 1st cases presented with symptoms during the last week of July [2022], but the outbreak was reported late. Respiratory treatment and isolation for 5 days were indicated for those affected and prophylaxis for contacts.

This year [2022], up to week 36 [4-10 Sep 2022], there have been 84 cases of whooping cough, when the average for the past 5 years is around 33.

Rockland County [New York State, USA] health officials are tracking whooping cough cases, because there are 12 cases currently in the county, far more than elsewhere in the Hudson Valley, The Journal News [TJN] reported.

So far in 2022, the county has seen 25 cases of pertussis, a respiratory infection with a distinct, high-pitched cough that is particularly dangerous to babies, TJN reported.

Speaking at a recent Rockland County Board of Health meeting, Health Commissioner Dr Patricia Ruppert said, "here we go again," the paper reported. Rockland, which has low childhood vaccination rates compared to most of New York State, had a measles outbreak in 2018-19 that sickened more than 300 people; and in mid-2022 a young adult resident who had never been vaccinated against polio caught the virus and was permanently paralyzed.

The COVID-19 pandemic didn't help, because routine childhood vaccinations were disrupted during the shutdown, Ruppert has said.

There was substantial variation in early childhood vaccination coverage across counties in New York State, with more than half of the counties having rates below the State's Prevention Agenda goal of 70.5%. The 2020 coverage rate in the county with the lowest rate, Rockland, was approximately half as high as the county with the highest rate, Livingston (42% compared with 82%).

The lowest regional rates of early childhood vaccination coverage were consistently found in the Lower Hudson and Long Island regions (in 2020, 54% and 59%, respectively).

Children attending daycare and pre-K through 12th grade in New York State must receive all required doses of vaccines on the recommended schedule in order to attend or remain in school. This is true unless they have a valid medical exemption to immunization. A medical exemption is allowed when a child has a medical condition that prevents them from receiving a vaccine. There are no nonmedical exemptions to school vaccine requirements in New York. This includes all public, private, and religious schools.

The state's recommended childhood vaccination schedule is available at https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/2378.pdf.

Outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles, polio, diphtheria, and pertussis are being seen in pockets of under-vaccination in high-income countries, such as Spain and the USA, with consequent morbidity and mortality. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends vaccinations in children to help prevent chickenpox, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, influenza, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, measles, meningococcal disease, mumps, pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, rubella, poliomyelitis, _Haemophilus influenzae_ infection).

When a large proportion of the population is immunized, even those who are unvaccinated can benefit from a lower risk of exposure to the pathogen, as a consequence of herd immunity. The spread of disease from person to person becomes unlikely when herd immunity is achieved. The percentage of the population needed to be immune to achieve herd immunity varies from disease to disease. The more contagious the pathogen, the greater the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to the disease to stop its transmission. For example, measles is caused by a highly contagious virus. It's estimated that at least 95% of the population must be immune to interrupt the chain of transmission of measles. The vaccination coverage rate required to provide adequate pertussis protection for the whole population is said to be 92-94% (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1753-6405.12732).

In the US, DTaP, and Tdap vaccines are used for pertussis immunization (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/dtap-tdap-td/hcp/recommendations.html). (Upper-case letters in these abbreviations denote full-strength doses of diphtheria (D) and tetanus (T) toxoids and pertussis (P) vaccine. Lowercase "d" and "p" denote reduced doses of diphtheria and pertussis used in the adolescent/adult formulations. The "a" in DTaP and Tdap stands for "acellular," meaning that the pertussis component contains only a part of the pertussis organism.)

DTaP is given to children younger than 7 years of age, and Tdap is given to older children and adults. Children should get 5 doses of DTaP, one dose at each of the following ages: 2, 4, 6, and 15 through 18 months and 4 through 6 years. Adolescents 11 through 18 years of age (preferably at age 11-12 years) should receive a single dose of Tdap. One dose of Tdap is also recommended for adults 19 years of age and older who did not get Tdap as an adolescent. Tdap should also be given to 7-10 year-olds who are not fully immunized against pertussis.

Expectant mothers should receive Tdap vaccine during each pregnancy, preferably at 27 through 36 weeks, because maternal antibodies are acquired by the fetus following maternal vaccination during this time. - Mod.ML]
