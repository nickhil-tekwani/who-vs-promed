A 19-year-old patient from El Bebedero in Tonosi district [Los Santos Province, Panama], remains in the Gustavo Nelson Collado Hospital in Chitre, with symptoms similar to those of [a] hantavirus [infection].

That is what Jose Delgado, Herrera Director of Health, announced when he indicated that the patient went initially to the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital in Las Tablas this past Wednesday [16 Jul 2014], and had to be moved to Chitre in order to be connected with mechanical ventilation. He added that the patient is in a delicate condition.

Meanwhile, the new Los Santos Regional Health Director, Nahir Cedeno, said that 3 adults have been diagnosed with hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome [HPS] in this province [nearly 30 this year (2014), as indicated below - Mod.TY]. Cedeno stated that 2 of them were admitted to the Joaquin Pablo Franco Sayas Hospital and the other is in the Gustavo Nelson Collado Hospital in Chitre.

In addition, he stated that a 12-year-old boy was also diagnosed with hantavirus fever.

[It is difficult to determine if the 19-year-old woman is included among the patients admitted currently to the Joaquin Pablo Franco Hospital in the report by the Regional Health Director, or if the 12-year-old is hospitalized now as well. Hantaviruses are endemic in Panama. The 30 May 2014 ProMED-mail post (archive no. 20140602.2515039) indicated that as of that date, there had been 22 cases of hantavirus infection in Los Santos Province. Apparently, the new cases, above, were still alive at the time the health authorities issued their reports.

Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, the one most likely responsible for these cases of HPS is Choclo virus, which is endemic in Los Santos Province. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive no. 20130204.1527935, of the 3 hantaviruses known to occur in Panama, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing HPS, and can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to the hospital late in the course of their disease. No ecological details are provided concerning the environment where these patients may have acquired their infections.

The rodent host of Choclo virus is the pygmy rice rat (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens_), a photograph of which can be accessed at http://www.medwave.cl/medios/perspectivas/Hantavirus/Actualiz/Fig2.jpg.
