Dear ProMED-mail readers,

A group of us at the Center for Clinical Research of the University of
Zurich Medical School are developing models to estimate a health score
for an individual. Part of the input for our models will come from
simple biometric and anthropomorphic data, such as weight and
cholesterol levels. In addition, input for our models will include the
individual's perception of his or her own state of health.

To build our models we need to collect data. The link below will take
you to an online health-related quality of life survey we have
developed for this purpose. ProMED-mail has kindly allowed us to
approach its community with a request to participate in our survey.
The survey is anonymous, and can be completed in just a few minutes.

We thank you in advance for your valuable contribution.

To complete the survey please got to
