Translation of information received on 16 and 18 Oct 2005 from Dr.
Jorge Caetano Junior, Director, Department of Animal Protection
(DDA), Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food Supply, Brasilia:

18 [41], 341, dated 14 Oct 2005).
End of this report period: 17 Oct 2005.

Date of 1st confirmation of the event: 8 Oct 2005.
Date of start of the event: 26 Sep 2005.
Nature of diagnosis: clinical and laboratory.

Description of affected population: fattening cattle reared on
pasture. There have been no reports of suspected cases in species
other than bovines.
In Eldorado district, FMD was confirmed in a farm located 3 km from
the index outbreak. The animals showing clinical signs are 55 cattle
aged between 4 and 12 months and 10 cattle aged between 12 and 14 months.
In Japora district, the disease was confirmed in 3 farms:
- The 1st farm comprises 182 cattle, out of which 20 cases were
reported (19 animals aged between 12 and 24 months and one animal
aged over 24 months).
- The 2nd farm comprises 132 cattle, out of which 4 cases were
reported (3 animals aged between 12 and 24 months and one animal aged
between 12 and 36 months).
- The 3rd farm comprises 783 cattle, out of which 31 have shown
clinical signs (15 animals aged between 12 and 24 months, 11 animals
aged between 24 and 36 months and 5 animals aged over 36 months).
Diagnosis:
Laboratory where diagnostic tests were performed / Species examined /
Diagnostic tests used / Date / Results
National Agricultural Defense Laboratory (LANAGRO-PA), Belem, Para /
bov / indirect sandwich ELISA(1) (using epithelium) / 8 Oct 2005 / positive
The Pan-American Foot-and-Mouth-Disease Center (PANAFTOSA(2)) carried
out the biomolecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of
the isolated virus using the neighbor-joining method to compare all
the nucleotides in the region coding for VP1 protein to those of
different strains of virus type O. This comparison showed a homology
of 90-94 percent between this isolate and the isolates obtained
during the FMD outbreaks due to virus type O that occurred in South
American countries between 2000 and 2003. The virus isolated is not,
therefore, an antigenic variant exotic for South America. It was also
established that it differs from the vaccine virus (strain O1 Campos/Bra 58).
PANAFTOSA also carried out studies to compare the immunological
status of the present isolate to that of the reference strain O1
Campos/Bra 58 (used for vaccine production) using the test of the
expected percentage of protection (EPP). This value was determined to
be 98 percent for animals that received a 1st vaccination and 99
percent for animals that received a booster vaccination after 30 days.
Source of outbreaks: unknown or inconclusive (investigations in progress).
Control measures:
- Stamping out (in progress)
- Disinfection of infected premises
- The municipalities of Eldorado, Iguatemi, Itaquirai, Japora and
Mundo Novo remain under quarantine. 12 checkpoints were set up to
prevent any movement of FMD-susceptible animals or their
products/by-products originating from these districts to national or
international markets.
- In Eldorado district, 532 holdings comprising a total of 79 639
cattle, 2205 sheep and goats and 1696 pigs have been inspected.
- In Japora district, 222 holdings comprising a total of 13 994
cattle, 228 sheep and goats and 319 pigs have been inspected.
- A new 25-km safety zone has been set up around the new outbreaks.
It does not exceed the 5 municipalities mentioned above.
The control measures in the region involve the use of material and
human resources from the State and Federal governments with
assistance from the public forces at fixed checkpoints and mobile teams.
Other details/comments:
There are many smallholdings in Japora. Epidemiological surveillance
is being carried out throughout the region.
There are 2 more suspect farms in the region; samples were submitted
to LANAGRO-PA on 17 Oct 2005.
(1) ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

Janeiro, Brazil

Description of affected population: fattening cattle reared on
pasture. There have been no reports of suspected cases in species
other than bovines.
In Japora district, surveillance activities led to the detection of 4
new outbreaks, on the basis of a clinico-epidemiological diagnosis:
- The 1st farm has 253 cattle, 16 of which (one animal aged less than
4 months, 9 animals aged between 12 and 24 months and 6 animals aged
over 24 months) were sick.
- The 2nd farm has 52 animals, 12 of which (7 aged between 12 and 24
months, 5 aged between 24 and 26 months) showed clinical signs of
foot and mouth disease.
- The 3rd farm has 16 cattle (2 sick: one animal aged less than 4
months and one animal aged over 24 months).
- The 4th farm has 142 cattle, 20 of which (all aged between 12 and
24 months) presented clinical signs.
In Mundo Novo district, an outbreak was detected on the basis of a
clinico-epidemiological diagnosis in a large herd of beef cattle
totaling 777 animals. 5 of these animals (aged over 24 months)
presented clinical signs. The affected farm is very close to Japora district.
Source of outbreaks: unknown or inconclusive (investigations in progress).
Control measures:
- Stamping out (in progress). Weather conditions (heavy rain) are
hampering the culling and destruction of animals in the outbreaks.
- Disinfection of infected premises.
- To date, 924 farms with a total population of 122 578 cattle, 3230
sheep and goats and 2713 pigs have been inspected in the zone where a
movement ban is in force.
- The municipalities of Eldorado, Iguatemi, Itaquirai, Japora and
Mundo Novo remain under quarantine. 12 checkpoints were set up to
prevent any movement of FMD-susceptible animals or their
products/by-products originating from these districts to national or
international markets.
- The 25-km-radius safety zone around the new outbreaks lies
completely within the boundary of the aforementioned 5 districts.
The control measures in the region involve the use of material and
human resources from the State and Federal governments with
assistance from the public forces at fixed checkpoints and mobile teams.
Final report: no.

[This virus appears to be the same one that has circulated in the
several South American countries beginning in 2000. Also, no pigs
have tested positive. The source of these outbreaks is unknown at
present, but the serious nature of the apparent spread from Mato
Grosso do Sul to Parana is undeniable. Hopefully, attempts to
regionalize this outbreak and then clean it up will meet with
success. - Mod.PC]
