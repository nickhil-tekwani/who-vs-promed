The Chinese National Health Commission reported on an additional human case of avian influenza A(H5N6) in Jiangsu. This brings the total cases to 23 in China since 2014.

The case involved a 10-year-old girl from Suzhou in Jiangsu. She developed symptoms on [29 Oct 2018] and was hospitalized on [3 Nov 2018]. She is now in a serious condition. Avian influenza is caused by those influenza viruses that mainly affect birds and poultry, such as chickens or ducks.

Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (such as fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (such as chest infection). The incubation period ranges from 7 to 10 days.

The more virulent forms can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure, and even death. People mainly become infected with avian influenza virus through contact with infected birds and poultry (live or dead) or their droppings, or contact with contaminated environments (such as wet markets and live poultry markets). Human-to-human transmission is inefficient.

People in close contact with poultry are more susceptible to contracting avian influenza. The elderly, children, and people with chronic illness have a higher risk of developing complications such as bronchitis and chest infection.

[H5N6 avian influenza viruses (AIV) have posed a potential threat to public health since emergence in China in 2013. The H5N6 reassortant viruses had been detected in poultry/avian populations in most provinces of southern China and neighboring countries. Considering the mammalian adaption mutations and antigenic variation detected, the spread of these viruses should be monitored carefully due to their pandemic potential. - Mod.UBA
