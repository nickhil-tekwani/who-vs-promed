A recent phylogenetic analysis (Lewis NS, Banyard AC, Whittard E, et al. Emergence and spread of novel H5N8, H5N5, and H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic avian influenza in 2020. Emerg Microbes Infect. 2021 Dec; 10(1):148-151; https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22221751.2021.1872355) suggests that in the recent past H5N8 viruses were being maintained in European poultry whilst additional new variants from unknown sources were being sporadically introduced into other European countries with detection in wild and domestic birds.

From the article referred to above: "The H5N8 virus and the H5N1 virus reassortant clearly infected wild birds migrating to Europe as evidenced by the wigeons in the Netherlands, but whether the H5N1 or H5N8 virus would be better maintained in wild anseriformes and therefore potentially diffuse more readily is uncertain." - Mod.PMB]
