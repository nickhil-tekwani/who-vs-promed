Health authorities in Costa Rica confirmed last
Tuesday a 2nd fatal case of dengue hemorrhagic fever.
The Press Office from the Ministry of Health
confirmed the death of a 29-year-old woman at San
Juan de Dios Hospital on 1 Oct 2005. Even though
the report did not identify the victim, her
relatives reported [to] the local press that the
patient was the mother of 3 girls. The 1st fatal
case of dengue hemorrhagic fever [DHF] occurred
last August, and the patient was a 24-year-old man.
Since 1999, no deaths caused by dengue
hemorrhagic fever had been reported in Costa
Rica. The Ministry of Health press release
reported that as of 8 Oct 2005, there were 27 369
dengue fever cases, compared to fewer than 7000
cases reported for the same time period in 2004.
Of all cases [which year?], at least 40 were
dengue hemorrhagic fever, which may be lethal.
Most patients were [reported from] Atlantic and
Central Pacific regions. The report also
indicated that there had been an increase in
malaria cases, from 714 reported in 2004 to 2282 as of October 2005.
In order to fight the epidemic, the Costa Rican
government has begun various campaigns, one of
which is the "sello libre de dengue"
("dengue-free seal"), a distinction awarded to
those households visited by health officers who
certify that there is no risk for having mosquito
breeding sites. Ministry of Health data also
indicate that the fight against dengue fever may
cost up to 146 million Colones [USD 306 000].

The Aedes mosquito in Malaysia, which carries the
dengue virus, has evolved into an extremely hardy
insect, with its eggs surviving for up to 6
months without water, a report said.
An entomologist specialising in mosquitoes from
the Universiti Sains Malaysia, Abu Hassan Ahmad,
said research showed that water was needed for
the insect's eggs to be laid but they could then
survive for months in dry conditions, the Star daily reported.
"Our lab tests have shown that the eggs can
survive for 4 months and we are sure they can
even last up to 6 months without a drop of
water," Abu Hassan was quoted as saying by the newspaper.
Malaysia is moving out of the dry southwest
monsoon period into a wetter season and the
scientist said this would see eggs being hatched.
"We have had a very long dry spell and in the
last month we've had rain. With the onset of
rain, the eggs will hatch and the larvae will
find their way into water-logged areas," he said.
Abu Hassan said "fogging" -- the process of
spraying insecticide to kill the mosquitoes --
killed the adult insects but not the eggs.
"The eggs are laid in tree crevices, drains and
containers when water collects there. It is
impossible to destroy the eggs totally," he said.
Separate studies by health and environment
officials in eastern Sarawak state showed
continuous fogging with the same chemical would
result in the Aedes mosquito becoming resistant
to the poison, said the newspaper.
Malaysia has been waging a campaign to stamp out
the mosquito, with the latest reports saying 76
people have died from dengue so far in 2005,
compared to 73 over the same period in 2004.
The country recorded a 17 percent increase in the
number of suspected cases last week, with 1201
reported compared to the 1023 the week before.
The total number of suspected cases so far in
2005 has spiked to 29 820, in comparison to 28
290 in 2004 [the total for 2004?], when the
highest-ever death toll of 102 was recorded.
Neighbouring Singapore is suffering its worst
dengue fever outbreak on record, with the death
toll reaching 13 so far in 2005 and total cases approaching the 12 000 mark.

More than 1200 suspected cases of dengue fever
were reported in Malaysia last week, the Health
Ministry said Tuesday, with the death toll from
the mosquito-borne disease reaching 76 so far in 2005.
Officials have escalated efforts to curb the
disease by inspecting construction sites and
residential areas where mosquitoes might thrive
in stagnant water, said Ramlee Rahmat, the
director of the health ministry's disease control division.
The number of suspected dengue cases nationwide
climbed to 1201 last week, compared to 1023 in
the previous week, Ramlee said. However, he added
that many suspected infections often turn out to
be false alarms after tests are conducted.
2 more people died of dengue, bringing this
year's number of deaths to 76, Ramlee said.
Between January and the 1st week of October 2005,
29 820 suspected dengue cases were recorded, an
increase of nearly 30 percent from the 23 163
cases in the same period of 2004, Ramlee said.
More than 8200 of those cases have been confirmed to be dengue.
Ramlee urged construction companies to
voluntarily check their premises for stagnant
water. "It has to be a community effort,'' Ramlee said.
Dengue, which is endemic to this region, causes
joint pains, high fevers, nausea and a rash. In
severe cases, it causes internal bleeding and leads to death.
Several Southeast Asian countries have reported
higher-than-usual infections this year.

Many southern provinces are suffering from a
dengue fever outbreak and the epidemic is
spreading to central and northern provinces. The
Ministry of Health reported 3575 dengue fever
cases nationwide in the past 2 weeks, including 2
deaths in southern Ca Mau and Long An provinces.
This disease has also appeared in central
provinces such as Thanh Hoa (245 cases), Ha Tinh (74) and Khanh Hoa.
Dr Pham Ngoc Dinh, Deputy Director of the Central
Hygiene and Epidemiology Institute, said that the
central region is now the hub of dengue fever,
especially Khanh Hoa with nearly 4000 patients.
He added that the spread of the epidemic could
continue until November. According to Dr Dinh,
the number of dengue fever patients is low in the
North because 18 northern provinces organized
effective anti-dengue fever networks while the
weather was unfavourable to mosquitoes.
