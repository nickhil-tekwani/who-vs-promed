Sydney doctors have confirmed 4 cases of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), a
sexually transmissible infection caused by certain strains of chlamydia,
NSW Health announced today, 1 Aug 2006. The infection, whose symptoms can
include the discharge of blood from the anus, constipation, and fever, was
reported among gay men in the Netherlands in 2003 and has since been seen
in other European countries and North America.
NSW Health and ACON (AIDS Council of New South Wales) warned the infection,
most commonly transmitted through unprotected anal intercourse between men,
was often asymptomatic. "Typically people develop a small, painless sore
where the bacterium enters the body, usually inside the rectum, 1 to 2
months after infection," NSW Health communicable disease director Dr Jeremy
McAnulty said. "But sometimes these signs can go unnoticed so it's
important to be aware of symptoms and seek antibiotic treatment as soon as
possible."
ACON president Adrian Lovney said using condoms and water-based lubricant
during sex and latex gloves during fisting would reduce the likelihood of
infection. "A new glove or condom should be used with every new partner to
prevent the spread of infection being passed from one to another," Lovney said.

[LGV is a sexually transmitted infection caused by _Chlamydia trachomatis_
serovars L1, L2, and L3. The incidence of LGV in the developed world is
low, and incidental cases are considered to be imports from areas where LGV
is endemic, such as West and East Africa, India, South East Asia, South and
Central America, and some Caribbean islands (1,2). As the "see also" list
below reflects, the infection has become more prevalent among gay males in
Europe, the USA, Canada, and now Australia.
