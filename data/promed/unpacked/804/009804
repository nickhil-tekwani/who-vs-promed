[The definition of the designations deaths, definite cases, probable
vCJD cases, and the case definitions can be found by accessing the
Department of Health website, or, by reference to a previous
ProMED-mail post in this thread (for example, CJD (new var.) - UK:
update March 2002 20020305.3693).
Data on vCJD cases from other parts of the world are now included in
these updates whenever available.
Also, data on other forms of CJD (sporadic, iatrogenic, familial and
GSS) are now included when they have some relevance to the incidence
and etiology of vCJD. - Mod.CP]

The Department of Health is today [Mon 4 Sep 2006] issuing the latest
information about the numbers of known cases of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease. This includes cases of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease
[abbreviated in ProMED-mail as CJD (new var.) or vCJD], the form of
the disease thought to be linked to BSE (bovine spongiform
encephalopathy).
Definite and probable CJD cases in the UK, as of Fri 1 Sep 2006:
-----------------------------------------------
Summary of vCJD Cases - Deaths
-----------------------------
Deaths from definite vCJD (confirmed): 112
Deaths from probable vCJD (without neuropathological confirmation): 44
Deaths from probable vCJD (neuropathological confirmation pending): 0
Number of deaths from definite or probable vCJD (as above): 156
Summary of vCJD Cases - Alive
-----------------------------
Number of probable vCJD cases still alive: 6
Total
-----
Number of definite or probable vCJD (dead and alive): 162
(The next table will be published on Mon 2 Oct 2006).
[Since the previous monthly statistics were released on Mon 7 Aug
2006, the total number of deaths from definite vCJD remains unchanged
at 156, and the overall total number of definite or probable vCJD
cases (dead and alive) also remains unchanged at 162.
These data are consistent with the view that the vCJD outbreak in the
UK is now in decline. The number of deaths due to definite or
probable vCJD in the UK during the 12 months of 2005 remains 5. The
peak number of deaths was 28 in the year 2000, followed by 20 in
2001, 17 in 2002, 18 in 2003, and 9 in 2004, 5 in 2005, and so far 3
in 2006. - Mod.CP]
Totals for All Types of CJD Cases in the UK during 2005 & 2006
-----------------------------------------------
As of 1 Sep 2006, in the UK in the year 2005, there were 122
referrals of suspected CJD, and there were 65 deaths from sporadic
CJD, 6 from familial CJD, 3 from iatrogenic CJD, 6 GSS
(Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker) syndrome cases, and 5 deaths from
vCJD.
The corresponding figures so far for the 1st 8 months of 2006 are: 68
referrals, 37 deaths from sporadic CJD, 3 from vCJD, 4 from familial
CJD, 3 from GSS and one from iatrogenic CJD.

Germany: Characterization of an atypical form of bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE)
-----------------------------------------------
The following recently published paper is reproduced here because of
its relevance to theories of the origin of new variant CJD, the human
form of BSE.
Title of paper: Atypical BSE in Germany - Proof of transmissibility
and biochemical characterization. By Buschmann A, Gretzschel A,
Biacabe AG, Schiebel K, Corona C, Hoffmann C, Eiden M, Baron T,
Casalone C, Groschup MH. At the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut (FLI),
Institute for Novel and Emerging Infectious Diseases, Boddenblick 5a,
17493 Greifswald, Insel Riems, Germany.
ABSTRACT. Intensive active surveillance has uncovered 2 atypical
German BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy) cases in older cattle
which resemble the 2 different atypical BSE phenotypes that have
recently been described in France (designated H-type) and Italy
(designated L-type or BASE). The H-type is characterized by a
significantly higher molecular size, but a conventional glycopattern
of the proteinase K treated abnormal prion protein (PrP(Sc)), whereas
the L-type PrP(Sc) has only a slightly lower molecular size and a
distinctly different glycopattern.
In this paper, we describe the successful transmission of both German
atypical BSE cases to transgenic mice over-expressing bovine PrP(C).
Upon challenge with the L-type, these mice developed BSE after a
substantially shorter incubation period than any classical BSE
transmission using these mice to date. In contrast, the incubation
period was distinctly prolonged when these mice were challenged with
the H-type. PrP(Sc) accumulating in the brains of these mice were of
the same atypical BSE type that had been used for the transmission.
These atypical cases suggest the possible existence of sporadic BSE
cases in bovines. It is thus feasible that the BSE epidemic in the UK
could have also been initiated by an intraspecies transmission from a
sporadic BSE case.

[3] China (Hong Kong SAR): Suspected vCJD case

China (Hong Kong SAR): Suspected 2nd Case of CJD (new var.) now discounted
-----------------------------------------------
The Department of Health of the Hong Kong [SAR] government and Bureau
of the Hong Kong Hospital Administration issued a joint statement on
Wed 30 Aug 2006 reporting that a suspected case of variant
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) was being assessed in Hong Kong. So
far, laboratory test results have proved negative, and it remains
uncertain whether the suspected case is truly a case of vCJD.
The patient is a 23-year old male born in Britain who returned to
Hong Kong at the beginning of April this year [2006]. He became ill
and was unconscious on 6 Apr 2006, when he was admitted to the
Overseas Chinese Hospital in Guangzhou, and was subsequently
transferred to the Prince of Wales Hospital in the Hong Kong SAR for
treatment.
The patient's condition is critical at the present time due to
necrotic changes in some of his organs. Though the patient shows
clinical symptoms similar to those observed in vCJD,
electroencephalograms (EEC) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) do
not correspond with those observed in vCJD. Tonsil tissue samples
were sent by the hospital to Britain for further examination, but
proved negative.
Therefore, so far, there is no definite indication that the patient
is suffering from vCJD. The Bureau of HK Hospital Administration has
stated that vCJD is a rare degenerative disease of brain and is not
contagious. Nevertheless, the hospital's disease control and
prevention authority will follow a set of strict procedures for
disinfection of medical instruments that have been used for
examination and treatment of the patient to avoid transmission to
other patients.
Hong Kong's 1st case of confirmed vCJD was discovered in 2001. The
patient was a 34-year-old woman who had lived in Britain for an
extended period of time and eventually succumbed to the disease in
2002.

[There appears to be no positive reason to diagnose the patient's
illness as vCJD. The report, however, is a reminder that there has
been a previous vCJD case in Hong Kong, a fact that has been
overlooked in most accounts of vCJD in the literature. - Mod.CP]
