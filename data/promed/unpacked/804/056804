Encephalitis has claimed the lives of 17 children so far in Bihar's
Muzaffarpur district over the last 2 weeks.

Alarmed by the situation, the Bihar government dispatched the health
secretary to the Shri Krishna Medical College and Hospital. Blood
samples have been collected from 4 children who are said to be in a
serious condition. Another 30 children have been admitted to the same
hospital.

The Bihar government has said they are taking all possible measures
to address the situation, including constant monitoring and supply of
medicines.

[There is no indication in this report as to the etiology of these
encephalitis cases. ProMED would appreciate additional information,
particularly when the blood samples are tested in the laboratory. It
is possible that these cases are ones occurring at the beginning of
the Japanese encephalitis virus transmission season.

[A review of prior ProMED-mail posts reveals recurrent threads on
undiagnosed encephalitis reports in India without clear resolution.
There are also thread reporting outbreaks of Japanese encephalitis.
ProMED-mail would greatly appreciate receiving more information on
both this current outbreak report, as well as prior undiagnosed
encephalitis outbreaks in India. - Mod.MPP]
