A chicken farm located between the Italian cities of Bologna and Ravenna [Emilia-Romagna region] is the site of a new outbreak of bird flu, authorities in central Italy said Wednesday [28 Aug 2013].

As a result of the discovery some 150 000 chickens [see comment below for detailed figures] will have to be destroyed, the Italian news agency ANSA reported.

The farm where the outbreak occurred is owned by the Eurovo group, which owns 2 other area farms where bird flu was detected earlier this month [August 2013].

[The above, 4th outbreak of HPAI H7N7 in domestic poultry in Italy since 10 Aug 2013, was reported on 28 Aug 2013 to the OIE in follow-up report no 3 (see, with map, at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=13986).

According to the report, the outbreak is located in the protection zone established around the 2nd outbreak in Mordano Municipality (Bologna, Emilia-Romagna). It involves a commercial layer hen farm; out of 121 705 "susceptible" birds, there were 27 000 clinical cases, of which 364 reportedly died.

The epidemiological comments are: "The last testing on 23 Aug 2013 was negative and starting from 26 Aug [2013] abnormal mortality was detected. The National Reference Laboratory in Padova has confirmed H7 through RT-PCR. The farm is already located in the restriction zones and depopulation will be carried out."

A summarising report addressing the 4 outbreaks, and a map of their location, is available at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000013986_20130828_145450.pdf. - Mod.AS
