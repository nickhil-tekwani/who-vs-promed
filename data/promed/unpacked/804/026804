ST. HELENA ISLAND -- For the second time in less than a month a Beaufort
County [South Carolina] horse tested positive for a deadly disease and was
euthanized last week. The St. Helena Island horse tested positive for
eastern equine encephalitis (EEE), a disease carried by migratory birds and
transmitted by mosquitoes. The test results came back Wednesday, a month
after county officials announced a Sheldon horse, euthanized, also tested
positive for EEE.
Aerial spraying in an area 5 miles around where the horse lived was begun.
The spraying is with pesticides to eliminate as many mosquitoes as possible
in the sprayed zone.
The horse likely contracted the viral infection 15 to 30 days before
becoming sick last week. Horses can be vaccinated against the disease with
shots given twice yearly, but many owners still don't know the shots are
available. The disease can also kill people but there is no human vaccine.
Beaufort County has had one known human death from the disease in the past
25 years. A 16-year-old boy died of EEE in 1989.
County officials are urging people to use insect repellents and wear
protective clothing. It's especially important for hunters and others who
spend much time outside when the insects are likely to be active. Owners of
emus, ostriches and similar fowl should watch for odd behavior in their
birds and contact a veterinarian immediately if illness is noticed. Birds
may hang their heads as if they are sleepy, lose their balance and
ultimately bleed from the mouth and ears. Similar symptoms could affect horses.
