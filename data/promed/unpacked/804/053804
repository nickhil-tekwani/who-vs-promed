After 60 people went home sick, the Bullitt County Health Department
[Kentucky, USA] confirms there was a foodborne outbreak at Zappos. The
bacteria that caused the sickness is a bacteria called _Bacillus
cereus_, according to Dr Swannie Jett, Bullitt County public health
director.

Health inspectors traced the source to Masterson's Catering. Zappos
employees are served a free meal at the workplace. "The outbreak has
stopped. The proper controls are in place. Zappos and Masterson's have
been very cooperative," Dr Jett said. In this case, the bacteria has
been traced to food not served at the proper temperature.

"Any issues that did arise from maybe the handling have been resolved.
So, there will not be any future instance I can see at this point," Dr
Jett said.

Health inspectors traced the sickness to food served to workers during
an overnight shift from Sunday into Monday [4-5 Dec 2011]. More than
1000 were served the same line of food. Health inspectors say while 60
became ill, and some checked out at area hospitals, this was still an
isolated incident.

[_Bacillus cereus_ food poisoning is the general name used for the
illness. However, the organism has 2 recognized types of foodborne
illness: diarrheal and emetic. The emetic syndrome is caused by
cereulide, a heat- and pH-stable peptide toxin. Consumption of food
contaminated with this toxin may lead to emesis between 0.5 and 5
hours after ingestion. The symptoms of this illness mimic those of
_Staphylococcus aureus_ food poisoning.

The diarrheal illness (more common in North America and Europe) is
caused by a high molecular weight protein while the emetic or vomiting
type (commoner in Japan than the diarrheal type) of food poisoning is
caused by a low molecular weight and heat-stable protein. In some
outbreaks there seems to be an overlap between the diarrheal and the
emetic types of illness.

The symptoms of _B. cereus_ diarrheal type food poisoning include
abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, rectal tenesmus, moderate nausea that
may accompany diarrhea, seldom vomiting and no fever. Symptoms develop
within 6-15 hrs and can persist for 24 hrs. This syndrome is rather
mild, and tends to mimic the symptoms of _Clostridium perfringens_
food poisoning. The diarrheal syndrome is caused by enterotoxins that
are produced during growth of _B. cereus_ in the small intestine.

Generally, symptoms are transient and mild possibly contributing to
underreporting. Large numbers of cells are needed to cause illness and
can occur when the food product (often rice) is held at a temperature
inadequate to prevent growth. Despite the illness' usual mild
symptoms, fatalities have been described associated with liver failure
(Mahler H, Pasi A, Kramer JK, et al. Fulminant liver failure in
association with the emetic toxin of Bacillus cereus. N Engl J Med
1997; 336: 1142-1148). - Mod.LL]
