A further comment
-----------------
I omitted to mention [in my previous comment [Hepatitis A - Estonia
(03): (VD) comment 20110915.2809] that most of the cases being
diagnosed in this outbreak in Estonia will be in adults, with no
apparent direct connection between most of them. This is because
children tend to be asymptomatic, but can still pass it on to their
elders, who are more likely to have symptoms. So there will be an
unseen undercurrent of multiple transmission in children, with the
occasional case popping up sporadically, so to speak, in adults.

The investigators have still not provided any data on the age
distribution of their cases, or their social background. This outbreak
is likely to be affecting a poorer area of Viljandi. In the northern
hemisphere, poorer areas of cities especially, possibly towns as well,
tend to be in the east!

These are extremely difficult outbreaks to control.
