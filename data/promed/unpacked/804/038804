The CDC has announced that milk from a Pennsylvania farm, which has been linked to an antimicrobial-resistant bacterium, sold in Iowa. According to the CDC, 3 cases of brucellosis were directly connected to milk consumed from Miller's Biodiversity Farm in Quarryville, PA. The milk was shipped to retailers across the state and in 18 other states.

People who have consumed raw milk or milk product from this dairy may have been exposed to _Brucella [abortus_ strain] RB51, a cattle vaccine strain that can be shed in milk and cause infection in humans.

Symptoms of brucellosis include fever, sweats, malaise, anorexia, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint point and potentially more serious conditions. Infections have also been associated with miscarriage in pregnant patients. Symptoms can appear anywhere between 5 days and 6 months after exposure. At this time, no cases of brucellosis linked to this outbreak have been confirmed in Iowa.

A link to the full message from the CDC, including guidelines for those who may have been exposed, can be found included with this story on our website.

[That the strain has been characterized as _B. abortus_ suggests that, like several past cases, this one is related to the bovine vaccine strain. RB51, a live-attenuated vaccine used to prevent _B. abortus_ infection in cattle, has been documented to cause human disease, most commonly through occupational exposures such as needle sticks. Importantly, unlike wild strains of _B. abortus_, RB51 does not stimulate an antibody response detectable by routine serological assays, requiring culture for confirmation. Additionally, RB51 is resistant to rifampin, a common treatment choice for human brucellosis.

It is my understanding that the sale of unpasteurized milk across state lines is prohibited https://milk.procon.org/sourcefiles/21_CFR_1240.61_pasteurization.pdf):

(a) No person shall cause to be delivered into interstate commerce or shall sell, otherwise distribute, or hold for sale or other distribution after shipment in interstate commerce any milk or milk product in final package form for direct human consumption unless the product has been pasteurized or is made from dairy ingredients (milk or milk products) that have all been pasteurized, except where alternative procedures to pasteurization are provided for by regulation, such as in part 133 of this chapter for curing of certain cheese varieties.

(b) Except as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the terms "pasteurization," "pasteurized," and similar terms shall mean the process of heating every particle of milk and milk product in properly designed and operated equipment to one of the temperatures given in the following table and held continuously at or above that temperature for at least the corresponding specified time:

Temperature Time
145 F (63 C); 30 minutes.
161 F (72 C); 15 seconds.
191 F (89 C); 1 second.

If the fat content of the milk product is 10% or more, or if it contains added sweeteners, the specified temperature shall be increased by 5 F (3 C).

Temperature Time
194 F (90 C); 0.5 second.
201 F (94 C); 0.1 second.
204 F (96 C); 0.05 second.
212 F (100 C); 0.01 second.
