Jamaica's Ministry of Health and Wellness says the outbreak of the _Klebsiella pneumoniae_ bacteria at Victoria Jubilee Hospital has been brought under control. The bacteria are said to have caused the deaths of at least a dozen newborns at the country's premier maternity institution in July [2022].

According to the regional technical director in the Southeast Regional Health Authority Dr Sandra Chambers, the ministry took immediate action after noticing an increased number of newborn deaths at the hospital in July [2022].

"We swabbed the walls, we swabbed the babies, we swabbed the staff, we swabbed the cots, and we even did water and soap."

Radio Jamaica news quotes Chambers as saying that gaps were identified and several recommendations were made, including an increase in the frequency of cleaning as well as an increase in how often soaps are changed to prevent the build-up of bacteria. She admitted that the chronic shortage of neonatal nurses could have also triggered the outbreak of the bacteria.

While the number of babies being born has increased, there has been no change to the nursing cadre "and so, you have one nurse to be nursing up to eight babies when there should only be doing one or two," she explained. She acknowledged that "if you're moving between babies then sometimes something can happen."

[Victoria Jubilee Hospital, located in Kingston, Jamaica, is the largest referral maternity hospital in the English-speaking Caribbean, with 248 beds, delivering about 8000 babies annually (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Jubilee_Hospital). The hospital was established in 1887 when prominent Jamaicans built a maternity hospital in honour of Queen Victoria who celebrated her Jubilee Anniversary that year.

_Klebsiella_ are a type of Gram-negative bacilli. _K. pneumoniae_ and _K. oxytoca_ are the 2 pathogenic species of this genus, causing nosocomial infections with high mortality and morbidity, including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, septicemia, surgical wound sites, meningitis, and bacterial endophthalmitis. The presence of invasive devices such as IV catheters, endotracheal tubes, urinary catheters, and use of antibiotics are factors that increase the likelihood of nosocomial infection with _Klebsiella_ species. The primary pathogenic reservoirs for transmission are the gastrointestinal tract, the hands of hospital personnel, and the healthcare environment. _Klebsiella_ can spread rapidly, often leading to clonal nosocomial outbreaks. The outbreak strains are frequently multidrug-resistant _Klebsiella_ spp, especially extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)- and/or carbapenemase-producers. The genes that encode the carbapenemases and ESBLs are plasmid-mediated. The genes that encode these beta-lactamases are often linked to genes that encode resistance to multiple other classes of antibiotics, such as the fluorquinolones and aminoglycosides on these mobile genetic elements, which readily facilitates horizontal gene transfer between bacteria.

_K. pneumoniae_ have caused of outbreaks in neonatal intensive care units (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5345312). Often breaks in infection control practices are found to have facilitated nosocomial transmission. Factors that place patients at risk for _Klebsiella_ infection include prolonged hospitalization (especially in an intensive care unit), severe illness, including major surgery, compromised states (such as diabetes, alcoholism), antimicrobial therapy, prolonged use of invasive medical devices, and inadequate infection control practices.

Infection control interventions in healthcare facilities aimed at preventing transmission of these multidrug resistant isolates include their rapid recognition by the microbiology laboratory when cultured from clinical specimens, placement of patients colonized or infected with these isolates on contact precautions, and in some circumstances, conducting point prevalence surveys or active-surveillance cultures of high-risk patients and their environment (http://www.cdc.gov/hicpac/pdf/guidelines/MDROGuideline2006.pdf). Active case detection may be followed by cohorting staff and patients (that is, segregating colonized or infected patients and the healthcare personnel who care for them from those without multidrug resistant _Klebsiella_ and the healthcare personnel who care for them.) (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm62e0305a1.htm).

More information on this NICU outbreak that occurred in July 2022 in Jamaica would be appreciated from knowledgeable sources. - Mod.ML
