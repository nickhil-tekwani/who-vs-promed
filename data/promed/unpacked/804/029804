The total number of pig farm samples that have tested positive for the porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) virus now stands at 7111 in 30 states, writes Jackie Linden.

The National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) reports 142 positive accessions out of 749 tested at 7 veterinary diagnostic labs for the week ending 31 May [2014], according to the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV).

The number of states reported to the NAHLN as having at least one confirmed case of PED remains at 30.

The total number of pig farm samples (termed 'laboratory biological accessions' in the official report) that have tested positive for the PED virus (PEDv) since April 2013 now stands at 7111, which includes 756 for the month of May [2014] so far.

Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 20 740 farm samples have been tested, of which 30 per cent have tested positive for the virus.

Results by age class
--------------------
- Suckling pigs
For the current month to date, 568 farms have been tested, of which 199 samples or 35 per cent were positive for PEDv. Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 2861 farm samples have been tested, of which 1543 samples or 47 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

- Nursery pigs
For the current month to date, 512 farms have been tested, of which 120 samples or 23 per cent were positive for PEDv.

Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 3283 farm samples have been tested, of which 1289 samples or 35 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

- Grower/finisher pigs
For the current month to date, 594 farms have been tested, of which 106 samples or 18 per cent were positive for PEDv.

Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 3666 farm samples have been tested, of which 1295 samples or 27 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

- Sows and boars
For the current month to date, 413 farms have been tested, of which 61 samples or 15 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 1752 farm samples have been tested, of which 615 samples or 26 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

- Unknown age class
For the current month to date, 1,655 farms have been tested, of which 300 samples or 18 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 9927 farm samples have been tested, of which 2551 samples or 25 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Results by state
----------------
According to AASV, the total number of states affected remains at 30. The total number of positive accessions on this report (up to the week of 25 May 2014) is 7111.

Those states with 100 or more positive tests are: Iowa, 2066; Minnesota, 1173; Illinois, 747; North Carolina, 706; Oklahoma, 396; Indiana, 382; Ohio, 322; Kansas, 264; Missouri, 196, Michigan, 175 and Nebraska, 139. For the most recent week (week of 25 May 2014), most of the new cases -- 32 of the 142 new positive results -- were in Iowa, followed by Illinois with 26 and Minnesota with 23.

Also reporting one or more positive results were Colorado, Indiana, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, and Texas.

Pig samples testing positive for PEDv: 26 069
---------------------------------------------
The total number of swine samples (termed 'biological samples' in the official report) since testing began in June 2013 now stands at 26 069. For the current month [June 2014] to date, 26 359 samples have been tested, of which 3923 or 15 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 105,141 samples have been tested, of which 22 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

The total number of environmental samples testing positive since testing began in June 2013 now stands at 5,984.

For the current month to date, 4,519 samples have been tested, of which 882 or 20 per cent tested positive for PEDv.

Since testing was fully reported in November 2013, 22 377 samples have been tested, of which 24 per cent tested positive.

[2] Swine delta coronavirus

Porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) has been detected in 242 samples from pig farms in 14 states.

For the latest weekly report -- for the week of 31 May 2014 in a report dated 4 Jun 2014 from the USDA Animal Health Inspection Service and made available by the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV) -- 14 pig farms (termed "swine accessions") have tested positive for the PDCoV, bringing the cumulative total to 242.

The National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) began collating testing data on PDCoV for the week of 30 March 2014. So far, 2028 accessions have been tested, 207 in the most recent week reported, so the overall percentage found positive is 12 per cent.

No new states have reported one of more positive accessions in the latest week and so the total remains at 14 (Table 1 and Figure 1 may be found at the source URL above).

PDCoV was previously known as swine delta coronavirus (SDCv). It is related and causes similar effects to the virus that causes porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED).
