Another 53 _Salmonella_ cases have been linked to the Nippy's food
poisoning epidemic, bringing the total number of confirmed victims to 127.
The new cases arose before Nippy's was taken off the shelves in a mass
recall on Monday.
Communicable Disease Control Branch head Dr Robert Hall said tests
confirmed the _Salmonella_ variety responsible for the outbreak,
_Salmonella typhimurium_ phage type 135A, was located in Nippy's products.
He said scientists had not yet located a specific source but added tests
were continuing and expected results by the end of the week.
Dr. Hall said his unit was testing other juice varieties, but added no link
had yet been found to the Brazilian orange juice concentrate. He said his
unit had taken samples from a wide variety of orange juices, and was also
still looking at a wide variety of other food products listed by victims of
the epidemic.
