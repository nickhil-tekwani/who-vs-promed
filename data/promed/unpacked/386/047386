A Comment on Methods of Smallpox Decontamination and a RFI
-------------------------------------------------
Decontamination recommendations in the CDC Smallpox Response Plan and
Guidelines (ver. 3.0) specify use of 5 percent aqueous solution of
phenolic germicidal detergent for decontamination of inanimate
surfaces in the environment and equipment used to care for a case of
smallpox (1). Further, choices for terminal decontamination of the
room used for such care include paraformaldehyde vapor (0.3gm/cubic
ft.) or fogging with 5 percent phenolic disinfectant.
This seems excessive given that variola virus likely has a lipid
envelope (2). Lipid-enveloped viruses have marked susceptibility to a
variety of disinfectants including halogens, aldehydes, quaternary
ammonium compounds (QACs), phenolics, alcohols, proteases,
detergents, and hydrogen peroxide (3). Therefore I don't believe a
phenolic disinfectant is the sole choice for disinfection of
inanimate surfaces contaminated with variola virus or other members
of the _Poxviridae_. I'd be interested in comments from other readers
of ProMED-mail.
I also do not understand the rationale for paraformaldehyde vapor
disinfection. While there are studies of use of formaldehyde vapor
disinfection against vaccinia virus, these appear to have used virus
embedded in scabs (4,5). My understanding is there is much less
release of virus when fixed in a scab matrix, so I am not sure this
is directly applicable. Fogging or vaporization of disinfectants in
the environment in US health care facilities was discontinued about
the same time as vaccinia virus vaccine was shelved: the very early
1970s. While reappearance of variola major would be an exceptional
event, I am not sure extraordinary disinfection is needed based on
understanding of this virus's structure.

[I was surprised also that the CDC recommendations specify phenolic
germicidal detergent. In composing an answer to a subscriber on this
question previously, the early literature that I researched (and have
since lost) consistently stated that the virus was relatively
resistant to phenol at environmental temperatures. The preferred
disinfectants were oxidizing agents (potassium permanganate or
ethylene oxide) and sulphydral-reactive compounds (p-iodo-acetamide).
Incidentally, poxviruses are resistant to ether and sodium
deoxycholate, but not chloroform. I suspect that variola virus in
fluids would be inactivated satisfactorily by most germicidal
detergents; however, the inactivation of virus in the crusts shed
from patients with the pustular form of smallpox is more problematic.
Informed opinion would be welcomed. - Mod.CP]
