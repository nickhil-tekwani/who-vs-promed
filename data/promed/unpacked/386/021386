Foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] has broken out in Lundazi and Vubwi districts of Eastern Province. Eastern Permanent Secretary Buleti Nsemukila says that over 1000 animals have been infected with the highly contagious viral disease which affects livestock with split hooves.

Dr. Nsemukila told journalists in Chipata this afternoon [Tue 26 Mar 2019] that government has since restricted the movement of animals in the region. He said that a total of 600 animals have been affected in Lundazi while 412 have been infected with the deadly virus in Vubwi.

The Permanent Secretary has also directed law enforcement agencies who mount roadblocks to demand livestock movement permits from all vehicles carrying animals. Dr. Nsemukila said that vehicles should be impounded where the drivers fail to produce the required documents.

He stated that there is need for farmers to be alert and report suspicious cases to the nearest veterinary offices in an effort to contain the situation.

The Permanent secretary has since advised farmers and game ranch operators to be alert and report any suspicious looking animals to the nearest veterinary offices.

He highlighted some of the symptoms of the disease as lameness, salivtion, hooves and mouth sores on the affected animals. He noted that the infected animals also have weight loss and reduced milk production.

[Previous to the current outbreaks, yet to be reported to the OIE, and since the start of 2018, 3 FMD outbreaks have been reported by Zambia, affecting cattle. This involved one outbreak in January 2018, at the Central province, caused by serotype O; the other 2 outbreaks, in September 2018 and in January 2019, were situated in the Northern province and were caused by serotype A (see 20190131.6285793).

The FMD-O outbreak in January 2018, diagnosed by the Central Veterinary Research Institute, affected cattle mainly on commercial farms in the Chisamba district of the Central Province. The source of the outbreak was not established. A ring vaccination was carried out with the administration of the vaccine to 13 643 cattle.

The 2 later FMDV-A outbreaks which occurred in the Northern province, in September 2018 and in January 2019, were attributed to illegally introduced animals; this serotype had not been previously reported in this district/province, though it had been reported elsewhere in the country.

The detection of FMDV serotype A in October 2018 was confirmed by the WRLFMD (Pirbright) as belonging to lineage A/AFRICA/G-1 that produced variable matching results in the VMSD tests that were conducted on the isolate. The most closely related field virus not pertaining to the country was identified as that detected in cattle Kenya in 2008 (94.6% identity). The VMSD tests carried out on 2 field isolates produced good matching results with vaccine strains A IRN/2005 and A22 IRQ/24/64, but not with A/ERI/3/98 and A/TUR/20/2006.

The current outbreaks are situated in 2 districts, Lundazi and Vubwi, Eastern province; serotyping and genotyping are pending.
