A private racehorse-training facility in southern New Mexico is under quarantine after a single horse there was confirmed to have a parasitic disease.

The New Mexico Livestock Board imposed the quarantine -- no horses in, no horses out -- at Jovi Training Stables late [Fri 18 Mar 2016] after one horse there was confirmed to have equine piroplasmosis (EP). EP is a bloodborne disease transmitted by ticks, or mechanically, via improperly sanitized syringes and the like. Mild forms of EP can appear as weakness and lack of appetite. More severe signs include fever, anemia, weight loss, swelling of the limbs, and labored breathing. Death may occur in some cases.

Humans cannot get equine piroplasmosis. The disease is also unrelated to equine herpesvirus (EHV-1), which recently affected Jovi Training Facilities and other tracks and training facilities in the area.

"It is important to keep in mind that equine piroplasmosis is nowhere near as transmissible as EHV-1," said Bill Bunce, the executive director of the New Mexico Livestock Board. "Compared to the EHV-1 outbreak, we are looking at a vastly different scenario here." Because tick-spread diseases are very uncommon in the dry climate of southern New Mexico, Bunce said "the chances are very good that we are looking at an isolated case.

"To ensure the disease is not widespread and to prevent further risk to the racing industry, we will be completing all regulatory testing and surveillance steps," Bunce added. "That's in addition to the quarantine that prevents horses from entering or leaving Jovi -- meaning that during the quarantine period, no horses from Jovi will be admitted at Sunland Park Racetrack."

EP is not considered endemic in the United States, but surveillance of the disease has increased in tandem with the increasingly international nature of horseracing. As such, the New Mexico Racing Commission requires that quarterhorses at sanctioned racetracks in New Mexico be tested for EP once every 2 years.

Racehorse owners who have had horses at Jovi recently are advised to contact their veterinarian for medical questions and to contact the Livestock Board for quarantine questions.

[Equine piroplasmosis is a tickborne protozoal infection of horses by _Babesia caballi_ or _Theileria equi_ (formerly _Babesia equi_) of the phylum Apicomplexa. The 2 organisms may infect an animal concurrently.

Piroplasmosis may be difficult to diagnose, as it can cause variable and nonspecific clinical signs. The symptoms of this disease range from acute fever, inappetence [lack of appetite], and malaise, to anemia and jaundice, sudden death, or chronic weight loss and poor exercise tolerance. The disease may be fatal in up to 20 per cent of previously unexposed animals. The tick vectors exist in the United States, and epidemics of piroplasmosis were seen in Florida in the 1960s.

The incubation period for _T. equi_ infections is 12 to 19 days, and infections are more severe. For _B. caballi_ infections, it is 10 to 30 days.

The clinical signs of piroplasmosis are variable and often nonspecific.

In acute cases, the animal is usually emaciated, jaundiced, and anemic. The liver is typically enlarged and dark orange-brown. The spleen is enlarged, and the kidneys are pale and flabby. Petechial hemorrhages may be seen in the kidneys, and subepicardial and subendocardial hemorrhages in the heart. There may also be edema in the lungs and signs of pneumonia. In chronic cases, common symptoms include mild anorexia, poor exercise tolerance, weight loss, transient fevers, and an enlarged spleen (palpable on rectal examination). Foals infected in utero are usually weak at birth, and rapidly develop anemia and severe jaundice.

The differential diagnosis for piroplasmosis includes surra, equine infectious anemia, dourine, African horse sickness, purpura hemorrhagica, and various plant and chemical toxicities.

Equine piroplasmosis can be diagnosed by identification of the organisms in Giemsa stained blood or organ smears. _B. caballi_ merozoites are joined at their posterior ends, while _T. equi_ merozoites are often connected in a tetrad or "Maltese cross." Organisms can often be found in acute infections, but may be very difficult to find in carrier animals. In carriers, thick blood films can sometimes be helpful.

Because babesia organisms can be difficult to detect in carriers, serology is often the diagnostic method of choice. Serologic tests include complement fixation, indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The IFA test can distinguish between _T. equi_ and _B. caballi_.

Other methods of diagnosis include DNA probes, in vitro culture, and the inoculation of a susceptible (preferably splenectomized) animal with blood from a suspected carrier. In addition, pathogen-free vector ticks can be fed on a suspect animal, and babesia identified either in the tick or after the tick has transmitted the infection to a susceptible animal.

Disinfectants and sanitation are not generally effective against the spread of tickborne infections. However, preventing the transfer of blood from one animal to another is vital.
