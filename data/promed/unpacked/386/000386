Eight senior physicians are ringing alarm bells about the risk of patients contracting _Clostridium difficile_ at Burnaby General Hospital, saying 84 people have died with the infection there within a period of 2.5 years.

"We would characterize current CDAD [_C. difficile_ associated disease] infection control management at Burnaby Hospital, at best, as a serious hazard to the patient population," said a 9 Jan 2012 letter sent to the head of Fraser Health by members of the hospital's infection control committee. "Such is the degree of the CDAD problem and the ineffectual response to it, that we believe it could objectively be considered medical negligence."

The doctors -- six of whom are department heads at the Vancouver-area hospital -- say there have been 473 serious cases of _C. difficile_ at the hospital from 2009 to mid-2011 and 84 associated deaths. They say these numbers do not include an outbreak of the infection that occurred in late 2011, which forced unit closures for several days at the hospital. The doctors also said that for more than the last 2 years, rates of the infection at Burnaby General Hospital have ranged between 2 to 3 times the provincial and national averages.

The doctors made 16 recommendations in the letter for how the issue can be resolved, including the immediate institution of enhanced cleaning within hospital units. "This is a problem that can be rapidly corrected, should the executive decision be made to do so," the doctors say in the letter, which was sent to Fraser Health CEO Dr Nigel Murray. The doctors added in the letter that the infection rates seen in Burnaby are "reminiscent" of the _C. difficile_ outbreak at Nanaimo General Hospital in 2008, where 94 people were affected 5 five were killed.

Murray responded to the doctors' letter within 2 weeks, outlining several measures that were being taken to control the issue. "The high rates of CDI at Burnaby Hospital have been the focus of a number of initiatives for the past several years," he said in a response dated 23 Jan 2012. "We have been making significant strides to reduce the incidence of CDI [_C. difficile_ infection] and associated morbidity and mortality."

In an interview Wednesday [29 Feb 2012], Fraser Health vice-president of medicine, Dr Andrew Webb, added that not all deaths involving someone who has _C. difficile_ are necessarily caused by, or directly related to, the infection. He allowed, however, that the hospital does have a problem that needs to be fixed. "We have a high rate of _Clostridium difficile_ in Burnaby and we accept that," he said, reiterating the message by Murray that officials are already taking significant action.

He said these actions have ranged from isolating patients with the virus [_Clostridium difficile_ is not a virus; it is a Gram positive, spore-forming anaerobic bacterium], to increasing cleaning procedures to shutting down areas of the hospital in the event of an outbreak.

Webb said the level of the infection at the hospital has dropped from 28 infections for every 10 000 patients in 2009 to 17.7 for every 10 000 patients now. But, he added, this is still above the provincial average and needs to be improved. "We still have a long way to go," he said. "That is still too high."

He said he could not confirm the veracity of the claim made in the letter of 84 _C. difficile_-related deaths. Webb also said that Fraser Health recently received the results of an external review done on the issue by a Toronto-based infection disease expert and is acting on that as well. "There are 13 recommendations in the report, most of which we are already implementing," he said. "There are a couple of others we will be looking at seriously for implementation. So there may be a few more things we can do about this yet."

New Democratic Party leader Adrian Dix, who publicly released the doctors' letter Wednesday [29 Feb 2012], called on the government to bring in the BC Centre for Disease Control to conduct its own review. "The evidence tells us that action needs to be taken," said Dix. "These are extraordinarily serious concerns expressed by the clinicians at the hospital," he added. "The crisis at Burnaby Hospital is a real one and one that the evidence tells us we can do something about."

A spokeswoman for the Hospital Employees' Union, which represents cleaners at Burnaby General Hospital, also called for action. "What the doctors laid out in the letter is right on and it is not new information," said Margi Blamey, adding the issues raised in the letter are similar to those identified in an independent report in 2005 by Doug Cochrane, then chair of BC [British Columbia]'s Patient Safety Task Force.

At the time, Cochrane was examining Surrey Memorial's sanitary conditions and emergency room procedures after the hospital had high infection rates in its birthing unit. He issued 19 recommendations to Fraser Health in his report at the time.

Blamey said she believes a focus needs to be put on resources for cleaning. "Cleaning is integral to infection control," she said. That is about people. You need to staff it adequately."

On Wednesday [29 Feb 2012], Health Minister Mike de Jong said he had not seen the doctors' letter until after Dix raised it in the House Wednesday, but said he has been aware of the general issues facing the hospital in Burnaby. "Burnaby Hospital is in the midst of a more comprehensive site redevelopment plan," he said. "It's an older facility and this is something that we have seen in older facilities where you have 2- and 4-patient rooms, where some of the bathroom facilities are older," he added. "So that's why we have invested so heavily in new hospitals across BC."

De Jong added that serious work is being done on the issue, and did not rule out another external review if that's what experts deemed appropriate. He also said that the situation has been improving. "In the last year the folks there have managed to bring the levels down," he said. "Burnaby Hospital is safe."

Burnaby Hospital did not meet the provincial benchmark in high-risk areas such as patient rooms during a cleaning audit conducted on 29 Mar 2012, the Fraser Health Authority said Wednesday [11 Apr 2012]. Doctors sounded the alarm in late February 2012 over infection control practices at the hospital, noting 84 patients with _Clostridium difficile_ died there between 2009 and mid-2011.

The hospital missed the benchmark by 2 percent, earning a score of 83, Fraser Health spokesman Roy Thorpe-Doward said in an interview. It exceeded the 85 percent threshold in areas deemed very high risk, such as operating rooms and ICUs, but missed the mark by 5 percent in high-risk areas such as patient rooms, with auditors finding structures including beds, windows, and doors were not cleaned as well as they should have been, Thorpe-Doward said. The hospital scored 72 percent in low-risk areas including administrative offices and maintenance areas, he added.

Whenever a hospital misses the benchmark on its monthly cleaning audit and inspectors identify areas in need of attention, another audit is conducted within weeks, Thorpe-Doward said. Inspectors from Westech Systems conducted another audit of Burnaby Hospital on Wednesday [11 Apr 2012]. The facility passed with a score of 86.43 percent. Last year [2011], Westech conducted 409 cleaning audits at the hospital, which scored an overall average of 86 percent.

The hospital was given an extensive cleaning in mid-March 2012, part of the Fraser Health Authority's response to the concerns raised about _C. difficile_ infections at the hospital. "They had an intensive super-clean, which ended on 23 Mar 2012, and then they fell back to their normal low staffing levels and a week later they failed a cleaning audit," said Health Employees' Union [HEU] spokesman Mike Old, adding there are not enough cleaning staff to keep the hospital safe for patients. The HEU represents cleaners at Burnaby Hospital, who are employed by service provider Aramark.

Infection control efforts at Burnaby hospital are undermined by the fact cleaners are employed by a private company rather than the health authority itself, Old said. "The health authority is accountable and responsible for the cleaning services, but they don't control them."

However, Dr Shane Kirby, chairman of the hospital's infection control committee and one of the doctors who sounded the alarm at the end of February 2012, said the cleaning audit is just one of many indicators of how well infection control practices are working. "I don't personally place too much weight on it, myself," he said. "I think based on what I've seen so far there has been a significant attempt to get things under control here at Burnaby Hospital." In addition to the extra cleaning, and staff brought in from other hospitals to conduct it, the health authority has brought in more infection control experts to help out in Burnaby, Kirby said.

A more telling indicator to watch for signs of progress is _C. difficile_ infection rates, Kirby said, adding they are starting to drop. Fraser Health's Thorpe-Doward said the latest figures from Burnaby, taken at the beginning of March 2012 and predating the "super-clean," suggest little change in _C. difficile_ infection rates at the hospital.

[_Clostridium difficile_-associated disease (CDAD) is a spectrum of potentially fatal illnesses that includes diarrhea, pseudomembranous colitis, and toxic megacolon. _Clostridium difficile_ is the most common cause of bacterial diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis in hospitalized patients, and antimicrobial drug therapy is the most important risk factor associated with the acquisition of _C. difficile_.

Recent outbreaks of _C. difficile_-associated diarrhea with increased severity, high relapse rate, and significant mortality, have been related to the emergence of a new, hypervirulent _C. difficile_ strain in North America, Japan, and Europe. The emerging strain, which hyper-produces toxins A and B, is referred to as North American pulsed-field type 1 and polymerase chain reaction [PCR] ribotype 027. These epidemic strains are characteristically resistant to fluoroquinolones, the use of which is one risk factor for disease due to this ribotype (Drudy D, et al: gyrA mutations in fluoroquinolone-resistant _Clostridium difficile_ PCR-027. Emerg Infect Dis 2007; 13(3); available at http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/13/3/504.htm). No mention is made in the news reports above if ribotype 027 is involved in the Vancouver-area outbreak.

Preventing the spread of _C. difficile_ in healthcare facilities involves clinical and microbiologic surveillance of hospitalized patients with diarrhea for _C. difficile_ and heightened infection control measures, including prompt isolation of patients suspected of having or known to have _C. difficile_-positive diarrhea and cohorting of patients with _C. difficile_-positive diarrhea where isolation rooms are not available, combined with particular emphasis on hand hygiene and control of the inappropriate use of antimicrobial agents (http://www.shea-online.org/Assets/files/position_papers/Cldiff95.PDF).

Healthcare workers caring for an infected patient pick up the spores on their hands and inadvertently spread them to other patients. Hand hygiene is therefore an especially important part of a _C. difficile_ infection control program. From a prior ProMED post Clostridium difficile - Canada (02): (ON) nosocomial, fatal 20110804.2351:

Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with _Clostridium difficile_ infection shed vegetative forms and spores of _C. difficile_ onto their skin and into the environment. _C. difficile_ spores have an exosporium that enhances their adherence to surfaces. Spores can be found on hospital items such as curtains, lab coats, scrubs, plants and cut flowers, computer keyboards, bedpans, furniture, toilet seats, floors, linens, telephones, call buttons, scales, blood pressure cuffs, electronic thermometers, and stethoscopes, where they may persist for months. Fecal soiling of the environment is greater for patients with diarrhea, and spore forms predominate in the environment because vegetative forms do not tolerate exposure to air. Spores that adhere to the hands of healthcare workers (HCW) during contact with the patient's skin and the surrounding environment can then potentially be transferred to other patients.

The detergent and mechanical action of hand washing in a sink with plain soap and water, rinsing, and drying with a paper towel have proved to be effective in removing both vegetative forms and _C. difficile_ spores from the surface of contaminated HCW hands (Gerding DN, et al: Measures to Control and Prevent _Clostridium difficile_ Infection. Clin Infect Dis 2008; 46(Suppl 1): S43-9; available at http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/46/Supplement_1/S43.long). Plain soaps have minimal, if any, antimicrobial activity. Although active against vegetative forms of _Clostridium_ and other bacteria, none of the antimicrobial agents (including alcohols, chlorhexidine, hexachlorophene, iodophors, and triclosan) used in antiseptic handwash or antiseptic hand-rub preparations are reliably cidal against clostridial spores.

Studies involving HCW caring for patients with _C. difficile_ infection have revealed that wearing gloves prevents hand contamination of HCW having direct contact with patients. Preventing heavy contamination of the hands is important, because handwashing may not remove all potential pathogens when hands are heavily contaminated. Studies have provided evidence that wearing gloves can help reduce transmission of pathogens in healthcare settings. For example, in a prospective controlled trial that required personnel to routinely wear vinyl gloves when handling any body substances, the incidence of _C. difficile_ diarrhea among patients decreased from 7.7 cases/1000 patient discharges before the intervention to 1.5 cases/1000 discharges (Johnson S, et al: Prospective, controlled study of vinyl glove use to interrupt _Clostridium difficile_ nosocomial transmission. Am J Med 1990; 88(2): 137-40; abstract available at http://www.amjmed.com/article/0002-9343(90)90462-M/abstract). After gloves are removed, hands should be washed with soap and water when caring for patients with _C. difficile_ infection because microorganisms can contaminate hands via small defects in the gloves or during glove removal.

Burnaby Hospital is a 314-bed university-affiliated healthcare facility located in Burnaby, British Columbia, an eastern suburb of the city of Vancouver, and is 1 of 12 hospitals operated by the Fraser Health Authority (FHA) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnaby_Hospital). Fraser Health is one of 6 publicly funded healthcare Regions into which the Canadian province of British Columbia is divided (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraser_Health).
