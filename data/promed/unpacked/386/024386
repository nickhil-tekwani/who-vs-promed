[The fact that India has reported outbreaks and confirmed occurrences of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) each year for at least the past 7or 8 years suggests that the virus is endemic in certain regions of the country. India may consider conducting targeted surveillance to determine where the virus may be naturally circulating and where it may be truly absent.

Detailed information on these outbreaks (from 2006 to 2013) can be obtained from OIE's WAHID database, in the section "Detailed country (ies) disease incidence" at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Diseaseinformation/statusdetail (note: to view the information on HPAI, you need to choose the country and scroll down to the name of the disease and time period).

The house crow (_Corvus splendens_) is a widespread resident in India. The plumage is glossy black, except for the nape, sides of the head, upper back and breast, which are grey. The bill, legs, and feet are also black. It is found in villages, towns, and cities throughout its range. It is distributed all over India except in high altitudes and forests. The crow is also found in Iran, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Burma, and was self-introduced to East Africa, Indian Ocean islands, Malaysia, and South Africa (http://www.birding.in/birds/Passeriformes/Corvidae/house_crow.htm).

A picture of the house crow (_C. splendens_) can be seen at http://www.birding.in/birds/Passeriformes/Corvidae/house_crow.htm.
