Surveillance of lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV)
-----------------------------------------------
This is in response to ProMED-mail posting "Lumpy skin disease, bovine - Jordan (02): intl. trade impact" [archive no. 20130703.1805916] and its commentary:

There have been [lumpy skin disease] notifications from Saudi Arabia, Oman and the UAE itself. At the National Wildlife Research Centre in Taif (Saudi Arabia), where endangered species such as the artiodactyl Arabian oryx (_Oryx leucoryx_) have been captively bred for decades, active surveillance for animal pathogens has been standard [Ref 1]. LSDV infection was detected in one of the Arabian oryx herds and reported [Ref 2]. Since these captive herds were biosecurely isolated from outside herds, the mystery of how they became infected still remains. [More] recently, an outbreak suggestive of LSDV was reported in Oman [Ref 3]. Sadly, this report lacked laboratory confirmation. This comment may spur increased reporting and surveillance, in line with the moderator's expressed wish.

Regarding vectors: apart from mosquitoes and flies, ticks should now be considered as potential vectors of LSDV. Based on work by South African and UK researchers, there is a growing body of evidence strongly suggesting the role of ticks in the epidemiology of LSDV [Refs 4-7]. Thus it may be pertinent to include tick monitoring in any intensified surveillance for LSDV and other transboundary/zoonotic diseases that may be imported via livestock or are already endemic in the region.

[Hopefully, Dr Fagbo's appreciated observations, which relate to lumpy skin disease (LSD) in wildlife in captivity, will indeed encourage professionals in the Middle East and Near East countries to enhance alertness and surveillance activities, with special attention to cattle, leading to early reporting of LSD cases and subsequently improved control of its spread.

According to their 2012 reports to the OIE, the official LSD situation in the 3 countries mentioned above, is as follows:
Oman: notifiable, present in the country;
Saudi Arabia: notifiable, never reported;
UAE: notifiable, not reported in 2012 (last occurrence, 2000).

Since mid-2012, LSD in cattle has been reported from Israel, Lebanon, the Palestinian Authority, and Jordan. The disease is known to be endemic in Egypt. It will be surprising if this arthropod-borne virus is not circulating also in other countries in the region, particularly Syria. A request for information on the situation in Iraq is pending.

In Israel, the 2 following live attenuated LSD vaccines have been applied within the general vaccination of cattle which has become operational since March 2013:

1. Sheep pox vaccine (fortified) "POX-10," manufactured by JOVAC.
2. Neethling lumpy skin vaccine, manufactured by OBP.

According to current (informal) information (weekly report of the chief veterinarian, "Hachaklait", Sat 20 Jul 2013), both vaccines seem to confer protection against the circulating LSD virus under field conditions. The Neethling vaccine strain seems to have some preference; observations need to be summarised and, hopefully, final conclusions officially published.

Israel's last follow-up report on LSD was submitted to the OIE on 19 Mar 2012. Until that date, 94 outbreaks were recorded and the disease was "continuing". - Mod.AS]
