The weekly #Ebola situation report from @WHOAFRO reports that 654 children under the age of 18 have been infected in this outbreak. 654! It also reports the health care worker infections are now up to 126. That's higher than what @MinSanteRDC is reporting.

Has Uganda decided to exclude pregnant and lactating women from access to the experimental #Ebola vaccine, @JaneRuth_Aceng, @MinofHealthUG? I noticed this from the most recent Ebola situation report from @WHOUganda:

Vaccination
-----------
Cumulatively 980 individuals have been vaccinated including 73 contacts of whom 4 are health workers, 727 contacts of contacts and 180 frontline health workers. Today 110 individuals were vaccinated including 5 contacts and 103 contacts of contacts and 2 front-line health workers.
Those not vaccinated included 6 lactating mothers, 2 not found; 3 pregnant, 7 refusals, 2 sick, and 15 not yet reached by the vaccination team.]

Ebola total climbs to 2277 amid security, reintroduction worries
----------------------------------------------------------------
The pace of new Ebola cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) held steady last week [week of 17 Jun 2019], but health officials are worried about activity rising in areas where transmission was low and new security incidents in several locations that threaten response operations.

Meanwhile, the DRC health ministry yesterday reported 18 new cases, and the World Health Organization (WHO) online Ebola dashboard today [26 Jun 2019] reflects an additional 12 cases, which would boost the outbreak total to 2277.

Security incidents, cases in earlier hot spots
----------------------------------------------
In its weekly situation report on the outbreak, the WHO said Ebola activity continues with steady and sustained intensity, with security incidents returning to Beni -- one of the outbreak's former major hot spots -- and armed group movements in Musienene and Manguredjipa impeding access to a health area next to Mabalako's hardest-hit area.

Another concern it aired is a tense security situation in neighboring Ituri province cities Bunia and Komanda in the wake of attacks in early June [2019].

Over the past few weeks, indicators show hints of easing transmission intensity in the 2 biggest recent epicenters, Katwa and Butembo. However, the optimism is offset by new cases in previously affected areas, including Komanda, Lubero, and Rwampara. For example, over the past week, Komanda reported its 1st case after going 11 days without one.

On the positive side, with rigorous contact tracing and surveillance, health officials were able to pinpoint a single transmission chain in each of the 2 health zones, allowing swift follow-up by outbreak responders.

Another infected health worker
-----------
According to the DRC health ministry's latest report, the 18 new cases are from 8 different locations, including 7 from Beni, 3 from Mabalako, 2 from Butembo [North Kivu], and 2 from Mandima [Ituri]. Also, Vuhovi, Lubero, Manguredjipa, and Musienene [North Kivu] each reported one new illness.

The patient from Lubero is a vaccinated health worker, a development that boosts the number of health workers infected in the outbreak to 123, which includes 39 deaths.

Health officials are still investigating 296 suspected cases.

Another 12 people died from their infections, including 7 in community settings and 5 in Ebola treatment centers. Since the outbreak began last August [2018], the virus had been linked to 1522 deaths.

Following attacks on a vaccination team and a psychosocial support team in Beni earlier this week [week of 24 Jun 2019], response operations partly resumed yesterday [25 Jun 2019] after a security assessment. Officials talked to families involved in the attacks, and plans are underway for officials to hold talks today with young people in the areas where the attacks took place.

The WHO said 2 responders were injured in the attacks, both of them day workers supported by the WHO.

Possible deployment of 2nd vaccine -- [see article from Science in item [3] below. - Mod.LK]

Uganda update
-------------
In a situation report on Ebola-related developments in Uganda today [26 Jun 2019], the WHO said there are no active Ebola cases in the country, but there are 3 suspected cases in the Ebola treatment center. 2 were negative in their 1st tests and are waiting to undergo a 2nd round of testing. The patients are in fair condition. The 3rd patient is a 52-year-old woman who has tested negative for Ebola twice, but her symptoms still require treatment.

As of yesterday [25 Jun 2019], 108 contacts were still under follow-up. So far, 1063 people have been vaccinated, including 249 frontline health workers.

The WHO's regional director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti, MD, today wrapped up a 2-day visit to Uganda's high-risk Ebola districts. In a statement, she commended health workers and health ministry officials for how prepared they were to respond to the cases.

Since the DRC's initial outbreak in 2018, Uganda has trained more than 9000 health workers to spot the signs of Ebola and has vaccinated 5000 of them, the WHO said. "The cost of preparedness is cheaper than response," Moeti said. "It is the contribution of donors that has enabled us to help countries prepare and, as we have seen in Uganda, prevent the tragedy of an outbreak escalating to unimaginable numbers."

[Byline: Stephanie Soucheray]

Ebola hot spots shift as pattern of spread fluctuates
-----------------------------------------------------
In the past 10 days, officials have recorded nearly 100 new cases of Ebola in the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a sign of fluctuating transmission throughout North Kivu and Ituri provinces, the World Health Organization (WHO) said in an update.

Today [25 Jun 2019], the DRC will likely confirm another 18 new cases, which will raise the outbreak total to 2265. As of yesterday, there were 1510 deaths, and 269 suspected cases are still being investigated.

Some spots heating up
---------------------
"New [Ebola] cases continue to occur in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, with fluctuating transmission intensity," the WHO's African regional official said in a bulletin released yesterday [24 Jun 2019]. "While the disease trend has reduced in previous hotspots such as Butembo and Katwa, the reverse is happening in areas that previously had low transmission rates, such as Mabalako, Lubero, and Mandima."

In the update, the WHO said cases during the previous 3 weeks originated from Mabalako (36%; 88/245), Mandima (14%; 34), Beni (13%; 33), Katwa (7%; 18), Butembo (6%; 12), and Kalunguta (6%; 15).

The WHO said contact surveillance has strengthened in Butembo and Katwa, with contact tracking ongoing in 22 health zones. A case contact from Katwa who moved to Dubai is being monitored remotely, and continued collaboration between the DRC and neighboring countries has resulted in more than 68 million screenings at border crossings and points of entry to date.

In addition to surveillance, vaccination with Merck's rVSV-ZEBOV continues throughout the outbreak region, with 141 754 people vaccinated as of yesterday [24 Jun 2019]. According to the DRC's ministry of health, 39 207 of vaccine recipients are high-risk contacts, 72 031 are contacts of contacts, and 30 516 are 1st-line providers.

New attacks on health workers
-----------------------------
A vaccination team and a psychosocial support team are the latest victims of violent attacks in Beni, DRC health officials said yesterday [24 Jun 2019].

The attacks came after the death of a young man who died yesterday in an Ebola treatment center. The man also had a twin brother who is a confirmed case-patient being treated for Ebola.

"It should be noted that these 2 health areas have reported several cases of Ebola in recent weeks," DRC ministry of health officials said. The attacks resulted in no deaths, but the assailants wounded 2 police officers and burned a car.

Today CARE, a humanitarian organization fighting global poverty, took note of the 1500 fatalities benchmark by announcing a ramping up of their efforts in the region. The group will expand hand washing stations in schools and distribute hygiene and personal protection equipment, with an emphasis on girls and women, who are the most common household caretakers for patients, according to a CARE news release.

"We must absolutely ensure that local communities are front and center in the response and empowered with the right tools and information to combat the virus," said Benoit Munsch, CARE's country director in the DRC.

[WHO Health Emergency Information and Risk Assessment, abridged, edited]
https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/325560/SITREP_EVD_DRC_20190625-eng.pdf

Situation update; data as reported by 23 Jun 2019
-------------------------------------------------
The outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in North Kivu and Ituri provinces, Democratic Republic of the Congo continues this past week, with a steady and sustained transmission intensity. While the security situation remained relatively calm in the Butembo/Katwa area, there was a resumption of violent community resistance incidents in Beni, coinciding with increased cases and response activities. Armed groups' movements continued to be reported in Musienene and Manguredjipa, impacting on access to the Kambau health area, neighbouring Mabalako's hotspot health area, Aloya. The overall security situation in Ituri (Bunia, Komanda) remains tense following the spate of attacks in early June 2019.

Indicators over the past few weeks demonstrated early signs of transmission easing in intensity in some major hotspots such as Butembo and Katwa. However, concerns remain over the concurrent increase in the number of new cases occurring in areas that previously had lower rates of transmission, such as the Komanda, Lubero, and Rwampara health zones. During this past week, Komanda reported the first new case of EVD following 11 days without new cases. In Lubero and Rwampara, rigorous surveillance and contract tracing efforts were able to successfully identify a single chain of transmission in each of the respective health zones. These findings were then swiftly followed up by prompt interventions to prevent further transmission.

Overall, EVD case incidence rates remained largely unchanged in the past week (Figure 1). In the 21 days between 3-23 June 2019, 63 health areas within 16 health zones reported new cases, representing 10% of the 664 health areas within North Kivu and Ituri provinces (Table 1 and Figure 2). During this period, a total of 239 confirmed cases were reported, the majority of which were from the health zones of Mabalako (35%; n=84), Beni (15%; n=35), Mandima (14%; n=33), Katwa (7%; n=16), and Kalunguta (6%; n=14). As of 23 June 2019, a total of 2247 EVD cases, including 2153 confirmed and 94 probable cases, were reported. A total of 1510 deaths were reported (overall case fatality ratio 67%), including 1416 deaths among confirmed cases. Of the 2247 confirmed and probable cases with known age and sex, 57% (1273) were female, and 29% (654) were children aged less than 18 years. Cases continue to rise among health workers, with the cumulative number infected increasing to 126 (6% of total cases).

[3] Response
- Tue 25 Jun 2019. Deployment of 2nd vaccine
[Science: doi:10.1126/science.aay5205, edited]
https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/06/ebola-outbreak-rages-plan-test-second-vaccine-sparks-debate
[Byline: Kai Kupferschmidt]

As Ebola outbreak rages, plan to test 2nd vaccine sparks debate
---------------------------------------------------------------
When the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) declared its 10th Ebola outbreak in August 2018, it had one weapon that was unavailable during the previous 9: a highly effective vaccine, produced by Merck & Co. 10 months later, health workers have administered some 130 000 doses, yet the epidemic is still raging; it is now the 2nd largest in history, with more than 1500 deaths.

That's why experts will gather in Kinshasa on 28 Jun 2019 to discuss a thorny issue: whether, and how, to deploy a 2nd vaccine to supplement the limited supplies of the Merck shot. Fielding it would also provide a rare opportunity to test another vaccine's effectiveness. But some experts worry a new effort could drain resources from the primary vaccination campaign and complicate efforts to persuade people to get vaccinated. "Having 2 vaccines ... raises an important potential for confusion and skepticism," says political scientist Rachel Sweet at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana.

DRC Minister of Public Health Oly Ilunga Kalenga told Reuters last month [May 2019] that he preferred to stick with one vaccine, so as not to "perturb the population." The DRC convened this week's meeting to help him and other officials "make an informed decision," a government spokesperson says.

The Merck vaccine has performed well during this outbreak and in a formal clinical trial in Guinea. It consists of a live but harmless vesicular stomatitis virus engineered to carry a gene for an Ebola surface protein. A single dose rapidly leads to immunity; the vaccine is "probably one of the major factors that have kept this a smoldering outbreak rather than an explosive one," says Daniel Bausch, who leads the United Kingdom's Public Health Rapid Support Team in London.

But there's not much of it. The World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland, says some 250 000 doses of the vaccine are still in stock, but Natalie Roberts of Doctors Without Borders in Goma, DRC, says not everyone who is eligible gets the vaccine because too little of it is arriving. To stretch supplies, the vaccine is only used in contacts of known Ebola cases and in contacts' contacts, as well as in nurses, doctors, and others whose jobs may expose them to the virus.

But at the moment, only 60% or so of the contacts can be traced, in part because of the deep distrust of the government and international organizations in the war-torn region hit by Ebola. As a result, says Jeremy Farrar, head of the Wellcome Trust in London, the Merck vaccine "will keep a lid on the epidemic, but will not bring it to an end."

A WHO advisory group has repeatedly recommended offering additional vaccines to lower-risk populations in the DRC. After reviewing 2 candidates, it recommended a vaccine made by Johnson & Johnson that requires 2 shots: one of a nonreplicating adenovirus that includes an Ebola surface protein, and then, 8 weeks later, a modified pox virus with several Ebola proteins that also does not replicate. The hope is that the combination will give long-lasting protection.

Doses for 1.5 million people are now available, and scientists at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine have produced a protocol for deploying them. They suggest offering shots to anyone more than 1 year old. To help establish the vaccine's efficacy, scientists would later test anyone seeking treatment for certain Ebola-like symptoms and see whether a smaller percentage of those who actually have Ebola were vaccinated, compared with those whose symptoms are a false alarm.

The fact that the new vaccine would be given to entire communities makes it attractive to local leaders, Sweet says. The current, selective approach opens the door for favoritism in who gets access to the vaccine, Abbe Telesphor Muhindo Malonga, president of the civil society in Butembo, DRC, recently wrote in a WhatsApp message to his followers.

But where the vaccine would be used is up for discussion. In one scenario it would be given to lower-risk people in communities that have already seen infections; in another it would go to communities that have not yet had Ebola cases, such as Goma, a city of 1 million and the capital of North Kivu, the province at the center of the DRC outbreak. Sweet says, "There is some wisdom" in first targeting places where the virus hasn't yet hit and rumors aren't rife; it would be difficult to explain why people in the same village receive different vaccines. But Roberts says it's more important to immunize people in the affected areas.

A consortium including WHO and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations--an Oslo-based public-private partnership to develop vaccines against neglected diseases--is ready to implement the study of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. "Essentially, it is pending authorization from within DRC," Farrar says.

Others worry that fielding a 2nd vaccine could strain existing efforts. Some also ask how many people will return for their booster vaccination. Bausch says one option is to offer a deworming treatment or some other incentive to bring people back to the clinic. "This has to responsibly address a real problem," and can't be "some hollow gesture," he says. But even one shot should offer some immunity, Bausch adds.

He hopes this week's meeting will convince doubters that the second vaccine deserves a trial. The Ebola community should be "looking at how we stop this outbreak," he says, "but also making sure we have the tools to stop future ones."

[Daily Mail, abridged, edited]
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-7157987/South-Sudan-not-prepared-Uganda-tackle-Ebola-experts-warn.html
[Byline: Vanessa Chalmers]

South Sudan will not be as prepared as Uganda to tackle Ebola if the killer virus crosses the border, experts warn amid outbreak in the Congo
- South Sudan is the 'most vulnerable' of countries neighbouring the DRC
- Uganda confirmed 3 cases last week [week of 17 Jun 2019] in the 1st cross-border spread
- Experts say it would have been 'much graver' had it spread to South Sudan
- The country is poor, has fewer resources, and is battling civil war, they said

Ebola could devastate South Sudan if it spreads into the country from the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, experts have warned.

A family infected with the deadly virus recently managed to cross into Uganda, where 2 of them died, but health workers were able to stop them spreading it.

But it may be a 'much graver' story if people were to carry the illness into South Sudan, to the north-east, because the nation is poorer and in the grip of a civil war.

South Sudan is deemed to be the DRC's 'most vulnerable' neighbour and has been on high alert for 10 months because people regularly cross the border.

The government in Uganda was praised for managing to stop Ebola spreading when 3 cases popped up there after a family crossed the border.

But Adrian Ouvry, a humanitarian advisor for the aid organisation Mercy Corps, said South Sudan is not prepared to give the same response.

'Sudan would struggle,' he told MailOnline from Uganda. 'The other countries at risk include Rwanda and Burundi. But of all of them, South Sudan is by the far most vulnerable.

South Sudan is a very poor country. It doesn't help there are civil war problems and ongoing activities that are very lethal. As far as I know the security there is not good.'

Even innocent local people are making the response difficult because many have a deep distrust of the governments and Western healthcare volunteers.

This is a particular problem in rural areas where communication is difficult and people may be less educated and more susceptible to political or religious propaganda.

[The Conversation, abridged, edited]

[Byline: Dr Steven Hatch]

[A discussion comparing the West African outbreak with the DRC outbreak, and the impact of the vaccine.]

The good news is that attitudes toward the Ebola vaccine appear to be positive in the affected areas. The bad news is that there remains a significant percentage, maybe as high as 20% of people, who profoundly distrust the government, often because the government has acted as a "battlefield enemy".

Further, a recent New England Journal of Medicine commentary by a doctor working in the region suggested that people who live in DRC are often skeptical of the intentions of international aid organizations who set up Ebola treatment units, yet seem to be unconcerned with tuberculosis and malaria, which are major and longstanding scourges in Africa. All these factors may cause families to "hide" Ebola cases from contact tracers, leading to further spread.

Thus, the vaccine keeps the current outbreak partially in check, while instability prevents its eradication. By contrast, the West African outbreak of 2014-2015 rose with such unprecedented speed that it dominated world headlines for nearly four months between August and October 2014. The alarm it generated led to the international response that helped contain it; today's DRC outbreak has not resulted in the same alarm.

The longer Ebola persists in the DRC, the more likely an improbable event will occur -- like the spread of the virus beyond the borders of the DRC, or perhaps much further beyond its borders. The spread into Uganda may simply be a warning sign. There is little cause for optimism that the epidemic will end anytime soon.

What both outbreaks do share is a devastating economic impact, one that can also spread beyond its borders and "infect" the entire region. The West African outbreak of 2014-2015 cost no less then several billion dollars, possibly as much as tens of billions of dollars. If Uganda becomes heavily involved, the current outbreak may prove equally costly.

[Byline: Diane Samson]

Ebola containment efforts in the Congo starting to run out of funding
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A recent report by the World Health Organization claimed that nearly USD100 million is needed to end the spread of the deadly disease in Central Africa, which has already claimed more than 11 000 lives. However, only USD44 million -- not even half of the funding they requested -- has been received.

The agency added that if it fails to get further funding, it might have to scale back or even cease operations in DRC.

Political cooperation, funding needed to stop spread of Ebola
-------------------------------------------------------------
To stop the outbreak, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is appealing for bipartisan political cooperation and further funding from member states.

"Bipartisan political leadership in DRC is the only way that communities will eventually understand the threat of Ebola and take ownership in ending the outbreak," he said in a statement. "Meanwhile, other countries have a global responsibility to support the dedicated health responders -- from DRC, from across Africa and across the world -- who are bravely working to save lives."

Ghebreyesus recently arrived from a visit to DRC where he met with Prime Minister Sylvester Ilunga Ilunkamba, opposition leaders, religious leaders, non-government organizations, and others to talk about how they could help end the outbreak.

The Ministry of Health is in need of USD7.5million (about Shs27.8b) to respond to the Ebola outbreak in the country, which has since claimed 3 people.

Mr Emmanuel Ainebyoona, the senior ministry spokesperson, said the money is only enough to facilitate the western district of Kasese, where the haemorrhagic fever was confirmed early this month [June 2019] and not the whole country.

"It [the money] will facilitate our health workers who are managing different health facilities, manning all points of entry, people doing outreaches, among others mass media messages," Mr Ainebyoona said on Mon.

As Uganda steps up its response to its 1st confirmed Ebola cases, preparations made since the outbreak began in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are proving crucial to containing the disease.

In Uganda, as of 22 Jun 2019, there have been a total of 3 confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease. All three had recently travelled to the DRC, and all succumbed to the disease. In response, 108 of their contacts are registered for follow-up. Since the outbreak was declared, 980 people at high risk of Ebola have been vaccinated. There currently are no new confirmed cases of Ebola in Uganda.

Uganda has called for the support of WHO and partners and together they have trained more than 16 000 community leaders and volunteers in remote border areas to spot the symptoms, provide medical attention to potential patients and to alert the authorities.

"We can also test blood samples here in Uganda now, giving us the results in just 24 hours."

Screening on the border, training over 9000 health workers, repeated simulation exercises, and vaccinations for over 4700 health workers -- all supported by WHO -- have been crucial in laying the groundwork for the response.

"The lesson [from the preparedness phase] is that it is vital to build up solid structures and systems," said Dr Mwebesa. "So even if this outbreak stopped today, and if we got another outbreak -- say 2 years later, we would be in a much stronger position to deal with it."

Dikembe Mutombo records Ebola messages for US officials
-------------------------------------------------------
Unable to send disease fighters to help battle one of the deadliest Ebola outbreaks in history, US health officials are turning to basketball hall of famer Dikembe Mutombo for help.

Mutombo, regarded as one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history and a well-known philanthropist in his native Congo, recorded radio and video spots designed to persuade people to take precautions and get care that might stop the disease's spread.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began posting the spots Mon 24 Jun 2019 on its YouTube channel and on the agency's website. Officials are trying to get radio and TV stations in the Democratic Republic of Congo to air them.

Mutombo, who moved to the US in the 1980s intending to pursue a medical degree, told The Associated Press he understands where the distrust comes from.

"Someone who doesn't look like you, who doesn't think like you, who is not from your village, who is from other places, just walks to your village with a nice beautiful white truck and telling you ... 'inject this chemical into your body to protect you from this deadly virus.' That's where there's a fight. This is where we're having a conflict," he said.

"How do you that build trust? That's the big problem we're having in the Congo," he said. "I believe as a son of Congo, I think my voice can be heard. Because everyone in the country knows my commitment to the humanity and the health."

[The reports in the "response" section above address the myriad of issues exacerbating the fight to control Ebola, that is, porous borders, need for preparedness, serious need for support, and funding. These are on top of distrust and violence, making for a difficult mix. - Mod.LK
