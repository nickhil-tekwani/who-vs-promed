Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) officials were trying
to figure out what to do with more than 700 banned turtles raided
from a Hermiston home, when the owner's ex-husband came forward with 300 more.

About 40 other people who bought the turtles at festivals and flea
markets around eastern Oregon also turned them in.

Some have salmonella, and now the question is, what to do with them.
"Normally, I think in this area, what you deal with is maybe somebody
bought something from a pet store and brought it into the area," said
Oregon State Police Sgt. Tim Brown. "But this was an awful large
amount of turtles."

Red-eared sliders are banned in Oregon, considered an invasive
species. They are still legal in Washington, but because a sample
tested positive for salmonella, no other states are willing to take
them in either.

"It's just a little bit irresponsible to send them, when you know you
have some turtles with a disease," said Kevin Blakley, of ODFW.

_Salmonella_ isn't the only problem. There is a federal ban on buying
or selling any turtle smaller than 4 inches (10.1 cm). The
confiscated turtles are only about an inch (2.5 cm) in diameter,
which leaves ODFW officials little choice but to put them all down.

"It's unfortunate, with the humane disposal that will have to be done
with the turtles," said Blakley. "But at the same point, the reason
we have a prohibited species list, is really to maintain the
integrity of Oregon's native wildlife habitats."

The turtles will be sent to Corvallis for lethal injections this week.

Police say many more red-eared sliders are still in the area. They
are asking anyone who bought a turtle to come forward, and say they
are not interested in penalizing anyone who has one.

Washington residents who bought turtles and are worried about
salmonella should call the US Department of Fish and Wildlife.

[Oregon has its policies for its reasons, yet I would suppose that
turtles in Washington, if released are not respecters of the border.
So one wonders how effective this ban is.

Instead of euthanasia, what a wonderful opportunity to investigate
how to treat salmonella in these animals and see what the
re-occurrence rate may be. - Mod.TG
