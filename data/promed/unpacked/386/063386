The Ministry of Public Health and Population in Yemen has released additional figures for the ongoing outbreak of cholera. Since the last update on [Sun 26 Feb 2017], 1598 new suspected cases of cholera and 0 deaths have been reported. The trend of suspected cholera cases per week appears to be on the decline in most districts or governorates. Nearly 85 per cent of the new cases recorded since the last update were in 10 districts within Al Hudaydah, Al Bayda, Hajjah, Sana'a and Ta'izz governorates.

Since the start of the outbreak in October 2016, a cumulative total of 22 181 suspected cases of cholera, including 103 associated deaths, have been reported across the country, with a case fatality rate of 0.45 per cent. Of these reported cases, _Vibrio cholerae_ O1 has been laboratory confirmed in 195 stool samples collected so far from 15 governorates.

The Health Cluster led by the World Health Organization, in partnership with the Ministry of Public Health and Population, UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund), OCHA (UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) and other nongovernmental organizations, continues to scale up the integrated cholera response activities in those districts still reporting cholera cases. Early warning surveillance has been strengthened in districts to ensure that all suspected cases are investigated and reported on time.

[Yemen is divided into 21 governorates (muhafazah), and they can be seen on a map at https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governorates_of_Yemen.

The mortality from cholera is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J: Cholera. In: Tropical pediatrics. Roach RR, Greydanus DE, Patel DR, Homnick DN, Merrick J (eds), 2014, Nova Science Publishers, 2015; oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al. (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs. 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al. (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 per cent to 3.6 per cent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose- or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref. 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
