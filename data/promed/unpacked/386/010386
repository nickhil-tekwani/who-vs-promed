[Riyadh is the capital and largest city of Saudi Arabia. It is also the capital of Riyadh Province, and belongs to the historical regions of Najd and Al-Yamama. It is situated in the center of the Arabian Peninsula on a large plateau, and is home to 5.7 million people, and the urban centre of a region with a population of close to 7.3 million people. Riyadh has the largest all female university in the world, the Princess Nora bint Abdulrahman University. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riyadh)

Afif is a city in central Saudi Arabia, in the Najd region. It is situated about half-way between Riyadh and Mecca. The modern town was established in the 1910s as a hijra, or "settlement", for the nomadic tribes of the area, particularly the tribe of 'Utaybah (see Ikhwan). It has since then grown into a small city of 39 581 as of the 2004 census, not counting the surrounding towns and villages, which together with 'Afif form the 'Afif Governorate (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afif).

It is not stated how this latest primary case became infected. That information would be helpful to control efforts.
