Moroccan authorities have killed 150 rabid [stray] dogs in Nador
----------------------------------------------------------------
According to information from the newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribiya relayed by a Spanish site, the municipal authorities of Nador [Oriental region, Morocco], conducted on [Wed 8 Jul 2015] a campaign for the elimination of 150 stray dogs in Beni Ansar, border town of Melilla [Spain].

According to the same source, the authorities' decision came as cases of dog rabies were detected in Melilla. The head of Public Health authorities of Melilla, Maria Antonia Garbin, imputed the origin of rabies cases reported in the Spanish enclave to Morocco.

Furthermore, the same source reports that the Moroccan authorities of the city have received several complaints from residents of Beni Ansar saying they were scared of being bitten by these wandering and potentially rabid animals.

Morocco eliminates 150 stray dogs following the outbreak of rabies in Melilla
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Municipal authorities in Nador in north east Morocco have eliminated dozens of stray dogs following an outbreak of rabies detected in the neighboring Spanish city of Melilla.

The Moroccan newspaper Al Ahdath Al Maghribiya reported today [Wed 8 Jul 2015] that the authorities carried out the elimination of 150 stray dogs that wandered around Beni Ansar, on the border with Melilla, after receiving complaints from residents who feared being bitten by these animals.

A newspaper photo shows dozens of dead dogs stored in a landfill after being apparently poisoned (no visible injuries on the bodies). It is entitled: "Beni Ansar exterminates its dogs under pressure from Spain."

The newspaper cites the minister of health and social affairs of the autonomous city, Maria Antonia Garbin, who associated the recent outbreak of rabies in Melilla (4 cases in June [2015]) with dogs from Morocco.

However, Spanish sources in Rabat and Nador said that there was no request, through official channels, addressed to Morocco to take this action. The newspaper added that the people of Beni Ansar had complained of "negligence" of local authorities that had allowed the expansion of these animals in all areas of the city, and their "infiltration in Melilla".

Animal rabies has been eradicated in Spain for decades, while in Morocco it remains endemic and, each month, about 20 cases are reported in the country, according to data from the National Health Security Office (ONSSA).

[The title of the brief published in Yabiladi is incorrect: it should read "150 stray dogs" instead of "150 rabid dogs." Such errors are rather common in electronic newspapers targeting the public at large.

Melilla is a Spanish enclave in north eastern Morocco and has been occupied since 1497. It benefits from the status of an autonomous city and maintains close formal and informal economic relations with the Moroccan eastern Rif (mountainous region of northern Morocco). It is regularly claimed by the Moroccan government, although a recent statement by the Moroccan prime minister in parliament recalled that the dispute over Ceuta and Melilla cannot be solved as long as that of Gibraltar (dispute between Spain and United Kingdom) exists (http://telquel.ma/2015/07/08/tour-benkirane-dit-culture-du-kif_1455048).

The region of eastern Rif and its chief town, Nador (see map at http://tinyurl.com/paa9nxk), are experiencing notable economic expansion but rapid urbanization raises various social issues including the proliferation of stray dogs.

Poisoning dogs (probably using strychnine) is not the most humane or efficient manner to counter the proliferation of stray dogs as it creates a vacuum in the dog population soon filled by the influx of new dogs that come to occupy space. One might ask why the National Health Security Office (ONSSA) has not opted instead for the implementation of the national program of mass vaccination of dog populations, successfully practised in other parts of Morocco.

It should be recalled that this intervention follows the appearance of cases of rabies in Melilla (see ProMED-MENA posting Rabies - Spain: (Melilla) ex Morocco, canine, RFI 20150618.3445850 at http://promedmail.org/direct.php?id=3445850. - Mod.AB
