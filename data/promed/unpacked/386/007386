[The 1st case of HPAI subtype H5N8 was reported from China (Liaoning province) on 24 Oct 2014 (see reports below).

In 2017, 2 cases of HPAI H5N8 were reported in Hubei and Shanxi provinces. The affected population was wild birds. See event summary and map at https://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review/viewsummary?reportid=22407

Wild birds can normally carry avian influenza viruses in their respiratory or intestinal tracts but they do not commonly get sick. They have historically been known as reservoirs and vectors of AI viruses. Around the world, surveillance measures have been put in place to monitor occurrence and characteristics of AI viruses in wild birds. Avian influenza viruses do not cause disease in wild birds, but it is very likely that wild birds might spread the virus via their migratory flyways. National authorities are strongly encouraged to raise awareness and establish cooperation mechanisms with hunters and other individuals who may come into contact with wild birds in order to provide early information on sick or dead wild birds.
