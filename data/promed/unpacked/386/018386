1st outbreak of _Erwinia amylovora_ in Morocco
----------------------------------------------
The NPPO [National Plant Protection Organization] of Morocco recently
informed the EPPO [European & Mediterranean Plant Protection
Organization] Secretariat of the 1st report of fireblight (_Erwinia
amylovora_ -- EPPO A2 List) on its territory.
In May 2006, symptoms resembling those of fireblight were observed on
pear (_Pyrus communis_), apple (_Malus domestica_), and quince
(_Cydonia oblonga_) trees in one orchard located in the region of
Meknes. Samples were tested at the laboratory and the presence of _E.
amylovora_ was confirmed. Surveys were carried out in fruit tree
orchards in the region of Meknes but no fireblight symptoms were observed.
In order to eradicate the disease and prevent any further spread, the
following phytosanitary measures were taken:
- all infected trees -- 43 hectares of orchard (106 acres) -- were
destroyed and burned;
- the infected orchard was placed under strict quarantine;
- information and extension campaigns for technicians, growers,
nurserymen are being organized; and
- surveys will continue, in particular during the flowering period in
fruit tree-producing areas.
The NPPO of Morocco considers that with the destruction of the
infected orchard and the absence of symptoms in other orchards, the
outbreak is likely to have been eradicated.
The pest status of _E. amylovora_ in Morocco is officially declared
as: transient, one outbreak under eradication.

["Fireblight is a serious [bacterial] disease of apples, pears, and
related trees and shrubs in the family Rosaceae, sub-family Maloideae
(pome fruits). It is native to North America, was introduced to
Europe in the 1950s, and has spread throughout many countries in
Europe and the Middle East.
Disease management involves use of sterilized cutting tools (alcohol
or bleach), pruning of all branches below the site of obvious
infection (at least 30 to 60 cm (12-24 inches), depending on branch
diameter), burning of cut branches and, in the case of severe
disease, removal and burning of infected trees and use of recommended
bactericides. - Mod.DH"
