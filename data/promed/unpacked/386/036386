This is an official CDC Health Update Distributed via Health Alert Network

Update: Information About Polonium-210 in

Recent events in the United Kingdom involving
radioactive material Polonium-210 (Po-210) have
caused concerns for possible public health risks.
The U.K. Health Protection Agency has information
about Po-210 and this event on their website:
(<http://www.hpa.org.uk/> ). More information on
this topic can be found on the U.K. National
Health Service website
(<http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=2086>).

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) has developed clinician guidance for
patients who believe they may have been affected
by Po-210 while traveling to or staying in the
U.K. (<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/isotopes/polonium/clinicians.asp>).

In addition, CDC provides the following basic
questions and responses about this topic.

What is Polonium 210?
----------------
Polonium-210 (Po-210) is a radioactive material
that occurs in nature at very low levels.
Although Po-210 can be made in university or
government nuclear reactors, it requires
expertise to do so. The exposures to this
radioactive material in London are a very rare
event. Po-210 emits alpha particles, which carry
high amounts of energy that can damage or destroy
genetic material in cells inside the body. Po-210
gives off 5000 times more alpha particles than
does the same amount of radium. Po-210 is used in
some devices to get rid of static electricity in
processes such as rolling paper, manufacturing
sheet plastics, and spinning synthetic fibers.

Is Po-210 harmful to humans?
--------------------
Po-210 is a radiation hazard only if it is taken
into the body through breathing or eating or by
entering a wound. This "internal contamination"
can cause radiation exposure (irradiation) of
internal organs, which can result in serious
medical symptoms or death. Po-210 is not a hazard
to the outside of the body -- neither polonium
nor its radiation will go through unbroken skin
or membranes. Careful washing will remove most
external traces of Po-210. For more information
about contamination and irradiation, see CDC's
fact sheet "Radiological Contamination and
Radiation Exposure" (<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/contamination.asp >).

Are other people at risk if they come into close
contact with a contaminated person?
----------------------------
People will not be exposed to radiation just by
being near a person who is internally
contaminated with Po-210. Health care workers who
are providing care for a contaminated patient
will not be exposed to Po-210 unless they breathe
in, eat, or drink contaminated bodily fluids.
Normal hygiene practices in hospitals for
microbial contamination will protect workers from
radiological contamination. For more information
on radiation protection for health care workers,
see CDC's "Radiological Terrorism: Tool Kit for
Emergency Services Clinicians"
(<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/toolkit.asp >).

What should you do if you were a passenger on one
of the British Airways flights or a guest in a
London hotel that is being investigated?
-------------------------
As of 4 Dec 2006, the U.K. Health Protection
Agency has stated that there have been no issues
of public health concern to British Airways
passengers. Passengers who traveled on any of the
investigated planes during the last month were
not at risk to Po-210 contamination (see
<http://www.britishairways.com/travel/home/public/en_gb> ).

In addition, the U.K. Health Protection Agency
reported that the Ashdown Park Hotel and Best
Western Hotel, Shaftesbury Avenue, in London have
been checked. No public health concern has been
found. A potentially affected area in the
Emirates Stadium has been checked, and there is no risk to public health.

If you were at any of these locations and you do
not have physical symptoms, you should not need routine medical screening.

However, if you were at any of these locations
and you have particular concerns about your
health or symptoms such as nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, hair loss, or unusual bleeding (see CDC
fact sheet at
<http://www.bt.cdc.gov/radiation/ars.asp>), see
your health care provider, who may be able to
advise whether further evaluation or testing is needed.

For more information, visit the U.K. Health
Protection Agency site at
<http://www.hpa.org.uk/> and send an e-mail
requesting information to <overseasadvice@hpa.org.uk>.

Should you be concerned about possible polonium
exposure if you are planning to travel to London now?
-------------------------
There is no evidence to suggest that you are at
any risk for radiation exposure or contamination
if you are traveling to the United Kingdom.

Seven workers at a hotel where murdered ex-KGB
spy Alexander Litvinenko held a meeting have
tested positive for low levels of radioactive polonium-210.

The Health Protection Agency is now asking anyone
who was at the Millennium Hotel's Pine Bar
between 31 Oct and 2 Nov 2006 to contact NHS
Direct. It stressed the risk to the general public was likely to be "very low".

A Russian businessman who met Mr Litvinenko in
the London bar is critically ill, according to reports.

On Thursday, about 50 friends and family members
of Mr Litvinenko attended his funeral at Highgate Cemetery in north London.

Mr Litvinenko allegedly met an associate, Dmitry
Kovtun, and his business partner Andrei Lugovoi,
also a former spy, at the Millennium Hotel on 1
Nov [2006]. Hours later former KGB agent Mr
Litvinenko fell ill. He died on 23 Nov [2006].
The other 2 men are also reported to be ill.

Russia's Interfax news agency claimed that Mr
Kovtun was taken ill after he was questioned by
British and Russian investigators.His condition
was described as critical, although earlier the
agency reported he had fallen into a coma. A
lawyer has denied there was any deterioration in
his condition. Mr Lugovoi is also in hospital but his condition is unclear.

All 7 bar staff from the Pine Bar who were
checked, tested positive for polonium-210. The
HPA said that as far as the workers were
concerned there was "no health risk in the short
term and in the long term the risk is judged to
be very small on the basis of initial tests".
However, the concern is that they may be at a
very small increased risk of cancer in the long term.

The HPA added: "All of them are assessed to have
had intakes lower than the adult family member of
Mr Litvinenko for whom tests also identified they
had been exposed to polonium-210.

"Our first priority has been to speak with these
staff members and agency experts have been
explaining the results and answering any
questions they may have." It said the staff
should carry on with their daily lives "as
normal" and it was "extremely unlikely" that
people around them were at any risk. However, the
HPA would not speculate on how the members of staff may have been infected.

HPA chief executive Pat Troop added: "Compared to
Mr Litvinenko, they have a fraction of what he
was exposed to. It's nothing like what he had. We
appreciate that this isn't an easy message to
hear, and there will be anxiety among the public
who were there, which is why we are offering support and testing."

The agency said it was assessing staff who worked
in the hotel's Pine Bar between 31 Oct and 2
Nov. Members of the public who were in the bar
on these dates can contact NHS Direct on 0845 4647.

Around 250 people who were in the bar on 1 Nov
[2006] have already contacted the advice line,
and do not need to call again, the HPA said.

Seven workers at a hotel bar in central London
have tested positive for radioactive
contamination, the British authorities said
today, as questions about the radiation poisoning
death of Alexander V. Litvinenko, a former
Russian agent, moved in new directions.

In Moscow, Russia said today that it had opened
its own criminal investigation into the death of
Mr. Litvinenko, who was buried today, 2 weeks
after he died, at a private family ceremony in
London. Russian authorities also said a Russian
businessman, Dmitri V. Kovtun, who was
interviewed by British investigators in Moscow,
was found to have signs of radioactive poisoning.

In London, attention swung back on to the Pine
Bar of the Mayfair Millennium Hotel, in Grosvenor
Square close to the American Embassy, where Mr.
Litvinenko was reported to have met Mr. Kovtun
and another Russian contact, Andrei K. Lugovoi, on 1 Nov [2006].

That was the day Mr. Litvinenko complained of
feeling ill. He also ate at a sushi bar on the
same day, although it is not clear which
establishment he visited first. The exposure to
the 7 workers at the hotel bar revived questions
about exactly where Mr. Litvinenko had been
poisoned -- and who else may have been contaminated.

The British health authorities said they would
contact 250 people who called in after Mr.
Litvinenko's death to say they had been at the
Pine Bar on 1 Nov [2006] and would invite them to
take a urine test for radioactive contamination.

Prof. Pat Troop, the chief executive of Britain's
Health Protection Agency, said all 7 workers at
the bar tested had shown "a low level of
contamination" that carried no short-term health
risks but a "very small" long-term cancer risk.

She declined to speculate about how the bar
workers might have been contaminated by polonium
210 -- a radioactive isotope that is dangerous
only when swallowed, breathed in or absorbed through an open wound.

She said it was technically possibly for polonium
to be carried in tobacco smoke, where minute
traces are routinely found in nature. But, she
said, she did not believe the levels of
contamination in the bar workers signified that
the toxins had been inhaled in cigarette smoke.

Dr. Michael Clark, the spokesman for the Health
Protection Agency's radiation protection
division, said the levels of radiation found in
the 7 workers at the Pine Bar were less than --
but close to -- that which had been identified in
an adult member of Mr. Litvinenko's family.

In Moscow, the Russian businessman, Mr. Kovtun,
became the latest among several people showing
signs of exposure to the material that killed Mr.
Litvinenko on 23 Nov [2006]. The Prosecutor
General's Office did not disclose his condition
except to say in a statement that he had "an
illness also connected to poisoning by a radioactive nuclide."

By tonight, however, the Interfax news agency
reported that Mr. Kovtun fell into a coma
"practically immediately upon completion of the
interrogation" by investigators, who questioned
him for a 3rd day in connection with Mr.
Litvinenko's murder. Interfax cited unnamed
sources. Later on, a lawyer connected to the
case, Andrei Romashov, told Reuters that Kovtun's
health was unchanged and satisfactory.

In a short statement, the prosecutor's office in
Moscow suggested that Mr. Kovtun might have been
a victim, and not a suspect, of whoever it was
who killed Mr. Litvinenko. The statement said Mr.
Kovtun�s poisoning was being investigated as an attempted murder.

Mr. Kovtun's illness could also mean that the
Russians had been exposed while meeting Mr.
Litvinenko, as was an Italian academic, Mario
Scaramella, who met him separately at the Itsu
sushi restaurant on the same day. Mr. Scaramella,
along with Mr. Litvinenko's wife, tested positive
for traces of radioactivity, but have developed no signs of illness.

Mr. Lugovoi, who is reported to be in the same
hospital as Mr. Kovtun, has also been tested but
no results have been announced officially. He was
supposed to have been questioned today by
investigators from Russia and Britain, but his
lawyer said their meeting had again been postponed.

In the weeks since Mr. Litvinenko's illness first
developed, Russian officials have reacted
dismissively to accusations that President
Vladimir V. Putin or anyone else in Russia�s
government could be involved, saying these
amounted to hysteria or deliberate misinformation.

Today's announcement came after diplomatic
pressure was put on Russia to take the case
seriously. The prosecutor general, Yuri Y.
Chaika, said Russia would remain in charge of any
detective work here and would try any suspects in
Russian courts, but Russian investigators have
cooperated with their British counterparts who
arrived on Monday as part of their investigation.

"Within the framework of provision of assistance
to British investigators, the General
Prosecutor's Office has carried out a check of a
number of circumstances of death of Alexander
Litvinenko, a former employee of the F.S.B. of
the Russian Federation,": today's statement said,
using the Russian abbreviation for the K.G.B.'s
domestic successor, the Federal Security Service.

"As the result of the check, it was established
that Mr. Litvinenko died as the result of
poisoning by a radioactive nuclide and Mr.
Kovtun, who met with Mr. Litvinenko in London,
has an illness also connected to poisoning by a radioactive nuclide."

Mr. Litvinenko, who became an outspoken critic of
President Putin, was buried today in London in a
ceremony attended by relatives, friends and others.

Among them were some of the most prominent
Russians living in self-exile from Mr. Putin's
Russia: Boris A. Berezovsky, an erstwhile ally of
Mr. Putin who fled what he has called politically
motivated criminal charges, and Akhmed Zakayev, a
leader of Chechnya's foundering separatist movement.

Alex Goldfarb, an associate of Mr. Berezovsky and
spokesman for the Litvinenko family, said later
that the funeral at Highgate Cemetry -- the
burial place, among others, of Karl Marx -- had
taken an unexpected turn when, against the wishes
of Marina Litvinenko, the widow, a Muslim cleric performed Islamic rites.

"It was supposed to be a nonreligious,
nondenominational ceremony according to the
wishes of the widow. Unfortunately, some people
appeared and against the explicit wishes of the
widow performed Muslim rites over the funeral," Mr. Goldfarb said.

"We had a choice to turn it into an unseemly
situation, but Marina asked us to respect the
memory of Alexander and let these people do what
they did. Let God be their judge," Mr. Goldfarb
told the British news agency that Press
Association. He could not immediately be reached for further comment.

"I do not know what Alexander wanted. Akhmed
believes that he converted to Islam on his
deathbed, but I have strong reservations," Mr.
Goldfarb said, referring to Mr. Zakayev, the Chechnyan leader.

A rash of fresh cases of radiation contamination
linked to the murder of former Russian spy
Alexander Litvinenko have triggered speculation
as to how he and others were exposed to the deadly substance, polonium-210.

Theories ranging from polonium-infused ice cubes
being dropped into drinks to the possibility of
spreading contamination through cigarette smoke
have gained media currency Friday after it was
revealed that 7 staff in London hotel had tested positive for radiation.

The staff, all bar workers, were on duty in the
Pine Bar of the Millennium Hotel in the upmarket
Mayfair area on 1 Nov [2006], the day Litvinenko
met 3 Russian contacts there before falling fatally ill.

The question of how the staff were affected has
puzzled experts because human contamination from
polonium 210, while a highly radioactive isotope,
can only come via ingestion, inhalation or transfer through a wound.

The Times newspaper said Friday it could have
been inhaled from vapour evaporating from a
contaminated drink or ice cube or by breathing in poisoned cigarette smoke.

The chief executive of the Health Protection
Agency, Professor Pat Troop, refused to speculate
on the possible causes at a news conference
Thursday [7 Dec 2006]. But she said: "You can
breathe it in if there are large volumes of it
around. But the amount you would take in that way would be very small."

The agency has repeatedly stressed that the
danger of contamination to the wide public is negligible.

Philip Day, a fellow of Britain's Royal Society
of chemistry and reader in environmental
chemistry at the University of Manchester in
northwest England, said the amounts of polonium
in tobacco smoke are normally "trivial".

"The sort of things we're hearing about the
various amounts of polonium in various workers is
much greater than you could have got from smoking normally," he said.

But he rejected the theory of inhaling vapour
from a contaminated drink. "You might get very
faint traces, but they would be comparable with
(traces from) smoking. It just doesn't evaporate
in significant quantities," he said.

"I don't think that anything that was in a drink
would get into the air and be breathed in by bar
staff. It would be more volatile from a hot
drink, such as tea, there would be more
possibility but even then, it's a little bit far-fetched."

Instead, he suggested there was a "common route",
perhaps from a liquid aerosol in the bar or dust,
but that would not be guaranteed to hit a specific target.

"It could have been put in a drink, perhaps an
ice cube, which would have contaminated the bar
staff, they'd be picking up the glass, tipping
the drink down the sink, and they could easily
get their hands contaminated," he said.

Bar staff could then have contaminated themselves
by rubbing their eyes, touching their nose or
mouth or eating food with their bare fingers.

One of the 3 men Litvinenko met in the bar --
private security agent Dmitry Kovtun -- was
reported Friday to have a "serious form of
radiation sickness" that was affecting his
critical organs: the liver, kidneys and bowels.

Russia's Interfax news agency quoted a medical
source as saying Kovtun had fallen into a coma on
Thursday, although he had since regained consciousness.

The Russian health ministry on Friday offered
radiation contamination tests in 2 Moscow
hospitals for anyone fearing to have come into contact with polonium 210.
