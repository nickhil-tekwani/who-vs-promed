After fruits and vegetables, it is the turn for the price of poultry to increase: in some regions prices have almost doubled. Where does this increase come from?

It's been a few weeks since the price of fruits and vegetables soared. From now on, it is the turn of poultry prices. In some areas, the kilogram is sold for 20 Dh [USD 2.2] against only 13 to 15 Dh [USD 1.5 to 1.7] only in normal times. Consumers no longer hesitate to express their dissatisfaction: fresh products are experiencing a significant and unexplained increase.

According to Aziz Al Arabi, president of the national association of producers of poultry meat (APV), quoted by LeSiteInfo, it is the breeders of chicks that caused this increase. Indeed, the cold wave that currently affects the Kingdom has resulted in the return of avian influenza.

The latter causes the death of 30 to 35 percent of chicks and 20 to 30 percent of chickens. Although this disease is not dangerous for humans, it causes a drop in supply and therefore a rise in prices.

Currently, the kilogram of poultry sells between 13 and 14 Dh [USD 1.5 to 1.6] at the wholesale market; add to that the margin that the intermediaries retain and the prices fly away!

It should be recalled that poultry meat reached its lowest price for several years in August and September [2017]: it was between 10 and 11 Dh [USD 1.1 to 1.2] per kg.

[The soaring price of poultry meat is attributed to an increase in mortality in broiler farms. One of its causes is the presence of the avian influenza virus throughout the national territory. This has not been officially confirmed and the subtype of influenza virus that may be circulating has not been determined.

Recall that in January 2016, the country experienced an outbreak of avian influenza caused by the viral subtype LPAI H9N2 which caused severe economic losses in the poultry sector. In April of the same year, the epizootic was considered under control, but its resurgence was noted in December 2016, with less severe economic repercussions. It would seem, therefore, that the virus is still in circulation and only waiting for the climatic severity of the winter to manifest itself again. - Mod.AB

According to Morocco's reports to the OIE, HPAI has not been recorded there since 1983.

Serious economical impact of a (hitherto unidentified or unpublished) HPAI virus strain, circulating since the start of winter [2017], has recently been reported from Iran as well (see ProMED-mail archive, numbers 20171231.5530508, 20171225.5522665, and currently https://financialtribune.com/articles/domestic-economy/79351/100-million-chickens-infected-with-avian-flu).

Clarifications, and -- in case confirmed -- serotyping results and the pathogenicity rates of the AI virus strain(s) currently circulating in each of the 2 countries, will be useful. - Mod.AS
