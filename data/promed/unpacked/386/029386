A veterinary practice has warned animal lovers of a deadly virus suspected of killing a number of rabbits.

Elwood, Briggs and Turner Vets in Kirton, near Boston, has issued warnings on its Facebook page after a number of pet rabbit deaths.

The Facebook post states: We have, unfortunately, seen a few cases lately that we suspect were the newest strain of viral haemorrhagic disease, VHD2/RHDV2. This viral infection usually leads to the death of pet rabbits. We now have a vaccine available which can help protect your rabbit, which is separate to the myxomatosis and VHD1 vaccine.

There are 2 strains of RVHD, known as RVHD1 and RVHD2 [OIE's terminology in the commentary below]. Both strains are lethal, and you must vaccinate to protect your rabbits. It is known as rabbit haemorrhage disease.

The virus can be caught from other infected rabbits, and the risk of spreading it is highest where there are a lot of rabbits in one place, such as rabbit shows, rescue centres, boarding kennels, or in houses with gardens that wild rabbits visit.

The RHDV2 can also be present in rabbits that are carrying the infection but are not showing signs of the disease. They could be incubating or fighting the disease, so they are infectious to rabbits they come in contact with. Only a few virus particles are needed to infect another rabbits so infection can be transmitted by cages, carriers, food bowls or bedding that have been used by infected rabbits.

Although RHDV2 is not spread by air-borne infection like flu or foot and mouth disease, it is spread by animals that eat the carcasses of rabbits that have died from the disease.

The virus can pass through the bodies of crows, foxes and flies and out in their faeces, so if there is an RHDV2 outbreak in wild rabbits in your neighbourhood, your rabbit is at risk.

RVHD2 has been in the UK since 2013 and in time is expected to overtake classic RVHD as the primary strain.

Rabbits can currently be protected by injection anytime at or after 5 weeks of age, then a booster every 12 months against RVHD1. This is when it is part of the combined Myxo-RHD vaccine.

RVHD2 requires a separate vaccination, every 6 to 12 months.

RVHD1 is a swift and efficient killer; almost all unvaccinated rabbits who catch RVHD1 die within a day or 2. The virus causes massive internal bleeding.

Some rabbits bleed from the nose and back passage before death, others die so quickly there may be no outward sign of disease at all.

RVHD2 is often fatal, although some rabbits have recovered with veterinary care.

What makes it more dangerous in some ways is that it has a longer period in which the rabbit is infectious, this results in the disease spreading more widely.

The strain can also be less easy to recognise because there is often no visible bleeding, so rabbits can simply be found dead or ill with no obvious cause.

Due to the lack of obvious symptoms, owners often do not realise their rabbit has an infectious disease, and this results in:
- The rabbit not being given treatment early enough.
- Precautions not being taken to contain the infection.

Both strains of RVHD are spread by direct contact with infected rabbits, or indirectly via their urine or faeces. The viruses can survive for months in the environment and are terrifyingly easy to bring home to your pets. They survive cold very well.

Both strains of RVHD have been recorded all over the UK. All pet rabbits should be vaccinated against both strains.

[Rabbit haemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly contagious and acute fatal hepatitis of the European rabbit (_Oryctolagus cuniculus_), caused by a calicivirus (genus _Lagovirus_). Up to 2010, all RHD viruses (RHDV) isolated belonged to one of the 6 identified genotypes (GI-GVI), among which the GVI is an antigenic subtype (RHDVa). In 2010, an additional RHDV was identified, phylogenetically and antigenically distinct from RHDV and provisionally called RHDV2 or RHDVb. A similar disease, termed European brown hare syndrome (EBHS), has been described in the hare (_Lepus europaeus_).

RHD is characterised by high morbidity and a mortality rate of 70-90 percent for RHDV/RHDVa and 5-70 percent for RHDV2. Infection mainly occurs by the oral route. In wild rabbits in particular, insects are considered an important route of infection or transmission and are often the source of long-distance spread. The incubation period of RHD varies from 1 to 3 days, and death usually occurs 12-36 hours after the onset of fever. The main clinical manifestations of the acute infection are nervous and respiratory signs, apathy and anorexia. In rabbits younger than 4-6 weeks, the RHDV/RHDVa infection course is subclinical, but when the causative agent is RHDV2, clinical signs and mortality are observed even in young animals from 15 to 20 days of age onwards.

For the above and additional information on the disease, including diagnostic techniques and requirements for vaccines, subscribers are referred to OIE's Terrestrial Manual chapter 2.6.2. "Rabbit haemorrhagic disease," adopted by the General Assembly in May 2016, available at http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.06.02_RHD.pdf.

For OIE's multi-annual RHD outbreaks map as accumulated since January 2015, see https://tinyurl.com/y84nchnk. Notably, no outbreaks of RHD have been reported to the OIE during the said time frame from the UK. In the UK's annual report for 2017, RHD is included among the animal diseases "Present in the Country." It is not notifiable. - Mod.AS
