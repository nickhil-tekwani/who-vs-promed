[Oman is the 2nd country to notify the OIE of the occurrence of MERS coronavirus (CoV) as an "emerging disease".

In the report that was submitted to the OIE, Oman indicates that the finding would not have any zoonotic impact, and that no human cases had been involved. However, in March 2014, there was a human case reported. See ProMED-mail's post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (20): Oman, WHO 20140109.2162284.

For more information on MERS-CoV in Oman, see also ProMED-mail's post MERS-CoV - Eastern Mediterranean (62): Saudi Arabia, Africa, animal res., camel 20140517.2478989.

From the OIE's "Questions & Answers on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV)", updated in May 2014 (http://www.oie.int/en/for-the-media/press-releases/detail/article/update-may-2014-questions-answers-on-middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-mers-cov/, the following questions are of particular interest:

"Are animals responsible for MERS-CoV infections in people?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Although MERS-CoV has been isolated from humans and a smaller number of camels and recent studies suggest that camels may be a source of some human infections, the exact relationship between MERS-CoV infections in camels and humans remains unclear. There is the possibility for several potential routes of transmission within and between species. The majority of reported human cases are a result of human to human transmission, although the spread is not easy between people.

Additional joint human health and animal health investigations are needed to establish the source of exposure for human infections with MERS-CoV when the source has not been identified as another human. So far, 3 patterns of infection have been reported by WHO:
- community acquired cases (the exposure sources remain unknown and are believed to include direct or indirect contact with animals, especially camels, or environmental source);
- hospital acquired infections;
- infection acquired through close human to human contact (household).

For further information about public health implications visit the WHO website (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/faq/en/).

What do we know about camel cases of MERS-CoV?
----------------------------------------------
Between November 2013 and May 2014 Qatar reported to OIE that MERS-CoV has been identified in 4 camels. [Note: Oman would be the 2nd country that reports to the OIE the occurrence of MERS-CoV in camels.]

Other published studies have indicated that MERS-CoV and genetic material matching MERS-CoV has been identified from camels in countries in the Middle East and North East Africa; publications also state that antibodies to MERS-CoV or a very similar virus have been identified in samples taken from camels in the Middle East and Africa. Studies suggest that similar strains of MERS-CoV have been identified in samples taken from camels and humans in the same locality and that in some cases there has been an association between infections in humans and camels.

Published serological studies also suggest that antibodies to MERS-CoV have been detected at a relatively high prevalence in sampled populations of camels in some Middle East and African countries.

Although some camel infections with MERS-CoV have been associated with mild respiratory symptoms in the animals, current evidence does not indicate that MERS-CoV causes significant illness in camels. Evidence from the limited number of infections that have been identified also suggests that infection in these camels has been self-limiting.

To develop a more complete understanding of the potential role of camels (and other animals) in the epidemiology of MERS several types of investigation are needed:
- Epidemiological studies which aim to determine the risk factors and potential exposure sources for camel infection and how camel infections relate to human cases of MERS; this includes genetic analyses of MERS-CoV.
- Animal infection studies (including experimental challenges) to determine the behavior of MERS-CoV in camels (and other animals) and how the virus may be shed from infected camels.
- In parallel diagnostic tests used for MERS-CoV surveillance in camels (and other animals) should be assessed for the reliability of their results in these species.

OIE together with WHO and FAO reiterate the importance of the public health sector and the animal health sector working together to share data and design studies to develop a better understanding of the overall epidemiology of MERS.

What about other species of animals?
------------------------------------
Although a relative to this virus had already been detected in bat species, and a fragment of viral genetic material matching the MERS-CoV was found in one bat from Saudi Arabia, current evidence does not indicate a direct link between bats and MERS-CoV in humans. More evidence is needed to directly link the MERS-CoV to bats or other animal species. According to published literature other species of animals (including sheep, goats, cows, water buffalo and wild birds) have tested negative for the presence of antibodies to MERS-CoV.

Surveillance for MERS-CoV in animals needs to be continued to better understand the epidemiology.

It is important to remain open minded about all potential sources of exposure for human and camel cases until more information is available." - Mod.CRD
