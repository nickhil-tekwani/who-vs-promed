Outbreak of tularaemia in Castilla y Leon, Spain
Suspected cases of tularaemia were reported by health centres to the
Epidemiological Surveillance Unit in Castilla y Leon, north west Spain, on
30 December 1997. The patients had high fever of sudden onset and ulcers on
hands and/or swelling of regional lymph nodes, and reported having handled
the carcasses of wild hares. A total of 80 suspected cases arising since
the second fortnight in November have been notified.
The Regional Environmental Authority has noted an increase in the number of
deaths of hares since the end of December, mainly in the areas with the
largest numbers of human cases.

[It would be appreciated if an informed member would share with us any
relevant background to this report. Is this number of human cases usual?
unusually high? If the latter, is there any proposed explanation? Has the
apparent secondary increase in sick hares, i.e. after the human cases, any
epidemiological explanation other than merely improved observation. -
