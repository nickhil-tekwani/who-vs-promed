Since 1985, dying or dead moose (_Alces alces_) have been discovered in
Sweden, suffering from what is now called moose wasting syndrome (MWS). The
syndrome has given rise to public concern about the Swedish moose
population and the implications for the annual cull of approximately 100
000 moose in Sweden.
Postmortem exams of these moose revealed unidentifiable lesions. The first
moose found dead with signs of MWS were necropsied at a diagnostic
laboratory, but between 1991 and 1994 we euthanized sick moose and did the
necropsies in the field. We continued to investigate dead moose.
Over the years, we have kept for observation one sick adult female moose,
calves from sick mothers, and healthy moose calves. Our suspicion was viral
infection (data not yet published).
Characteristic symptoms of MWS are aberrant behavior, signs of CNS
disturbance, blindness, lesions on the skin, and mucosal lesions in the
nose, mouth, and the gastrointestinal tract. In 1993 we also observed
instantaneous deaths, brittle bone (osteoporosis), and flabby hearts, but
no typical signs of MWS. It has been suggested that these were symptoms of
a more acute phase of MWS, but another disease concurrent with MWS has not
been excluded.
Data from dead moose without signs of traumatic injury (i.e., deaths caused
by vehicle collisions, hunting, predation, etc.) have been collected since
1991. As of 1998, we had data from 1361 moose, of which a large number were
found in the southern part of Sweden; however, MWS was observed nationwide.
The temporal distribution of non-traumatic moose deaths peaked nationwide
in 1992. The yearly risk of moose death due to non-traumatic causes is
dependent on age, but not significantly dependent on sex. Our
investigations have shown that the average yearly risk of dying from
non-accidental causes, including MWS, was 5.6 percent among females and 3.6
percent among males in the most affected area.
Though we and others have been working for years with this complex issue,
and hypotheses have ben put forward, no cause has yet been identified for
MWS at the individual or the population level. Plausible hypotheses are
divided into food-related and host-parasite related. The food-related
hypotheses are based on either acidification/liming, browser density/food
production, or pollution; the only host-parasite cause proposed is a virus.
Though most of the hypotheses are supported by some observation, they are
still only post-hoc attempts to explain these very observations. In our
view, however, few of the hypotheses have been critically tested.
In several publications we have described the morphology, clinical signs,
and the behavior associated with MWS. We are soon going to describe the
spatial and temporal pattern of MWS, the sex-specific demography, and the
seasonal pattern of moose deaths. We will also be estimating death risk due
to MWS. Others have also published their investigations and ideas about the
syndrome. If any ProMED-mail reader is interested, we can distribute a list
of publications to your email address.
Lastly, what were the conclusions drawn from the moose die-off in Minnesota
some years ago?
