----------------------------------------------------------------------
With regard to the recent finding of chronic wasting disease in Arkansas: it is my opinion that to report that it is "extremely unlikely that (CWD was introduced with) those 112 elk" is a bit disingenuous. In my opinion, it is as likely as any other scenario. The animal was located roughly 250 miles [402 km] from the nearest free-ranging case in Missouri, making introduction by free-ranging animal movement unlikely. That, of course, may leave movement of farmed cervids as the default rationalization that is commonly used by wildlife officials to very conveniently explain away new cases of CWD; one without any more merit, with the information we have so far in this case, than the likelihood it was introduced with the original elk herd.

A number of important questions remain unanswered: with an estimate that over 200 elk have been tested for CWD in the past 20 years in Arkansas, how does that estimate align with the overall herd size in that time frame? What degree of confidence does that level of testing provide towards identifying a positive animal given a very low expected prevalence? Why was CWD first identified in elk in this state -- given that elk are to some degree more resistant to CWD than white-tailed deer? Will the state attempt to manage this focus like most cases of CWD in farmed cervids are managed, an approach that seemed to work for New York State?

It also begs the question of whether an antemortem test for CWD, if available at the time the original elk were relocated, would have been useful. Even today, with an experimental antemortem test providing a sensitivity of between 75-80 percent, elk are still being moved from (apparently) CWD-free areas to other parts of North America without testing -- a practice not without its own ramifications apart from CWD (see http://www.weau.com/home/headlines/Four-elk-killed-in-Jackson-County-by-a-tick-borne-parasite-303323401.html).

In short, I think that by saying it's extremely unlikely that CWD was introduced into Arkansas with those 1st elk imported partly from Colorado -- where CWD has been found since the late 1960s, is to ignore the elephant in the room. Epidemiological studies will help shed light on yesterday's [23 Feb 2016] finding, but we should not by any means downplay the chance it was imported in the 1980s.

[ProMED thanks Dr. Haley for this comment. There are some reasonable questions here, such as how long is the incubation period of CWD? Could it really have sat dormant in a herd or descendant of a herd ancestor for such a long period of time? Can it be transmitted genetically? Alternatively there is a feed contamination issue or this disease was tracked in from an infected animal, or possibly from infected urine used for bait by hunters.

While there is an antemortem test and its sensitivity is perhaps regarded as reasonable, its specificity may not be so reasonable, meaning that it may detect false positives. - Mod.TG
