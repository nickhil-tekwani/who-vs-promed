The Chinese man suspected of poisoning gyoza [a Chinese dumpling] that
sickened 10 people in Japan has said he injected pesticide into gyoza
on 3 separate occasions from October through December 2007, China's
Public Security Ministry said Sunday [28 Mar 2010].

According to Du Hangwei, the head of the ministry's criminal
investigation bureau, Lu Yueting told investigators he became
disgruntled because the Tianyang Food Company in Shijiazhuang, Hebei
Province, treated him differently from its permanent employees. Lu was
a temporary employee at Tianyang Food, which manufactured the gyoza.

Lu also was quoted as saying that he decided to seek revenge partly
because the company did not give his wife a bonus when she took
maternity leave.

At a briefing for certain members of the Japanese media, including The
Yomiuri Shimbun, Du emphasized that Lu acted alone, denying the
possibility he had an accomplice.

It was the 1st time since the official Xinhua News Agency reported
Lu's arrest on Friday [26 mar 2010] that a senior official at the
ministry had given detailed information about the investigation
directly to members of the Japanese media. Du also said China had
already invited senior police officials from Japan, emphasizing
China's intention to closely cooperate with Japan in the investigation.

According to Du, Lu stole methamidophos, a phosphorus pesticide, from
the cleaning department at the Tianyang Food plant and obtained
several syringes that had been thrown away by a medical institution in
July and August 2007.

Lu allegedly snuck into a refrigerated room where the gyoza were kept,
and injected methamidophos into the gyoza with a syringe on 1 Oct
[2007], about 4 months before the food poisoning cases caused by the
gyoza in Chiba and Hyogo prefectures came to light in January 2008. Lu
also is believed to have laced gyoza with the pesticide in late
October and late December 2007 using the same method, and then dumped
the syringes in a sewer.

Du said the Chinese police believed the gyoza allegedly poisoned by Lu
in late December 2007 caused the poisoning cases in Chengde, Hebei
Province, in June 2008.

Lu is said to have been a custodian at a cafeteria since 1993. Du
emphasized that the Chinese police had seen Lu as an important
potential suspect from the beginning, but said it took more than 2
years to arrest him because the police had to investigate 586 people
who had access to the refrigerated room.

Du said police learned that Lu had confessed his actions to his wife
and relatives after the poisoning cases came to light. According to
Du, the police took Lu into custody 16 Mar 2010 and he admitted
putting methamidophos in the gyoza.

On 21 Mar 2010, syringes were found dumped in a sewer where Lu said he
discarded them, Du said.

According to Du, Lu told investigators he did not expect his actions
to result in the sickening of Japanese consumers and he regretted what
he had done.

The poisonings began making headlines in Japan in late January 2008
after 3 members of a family in Hyogo Prefecture became ill on 5 Jan
[2008] after eating frozen gyoza made by Tianyang Food. The product
was manufactured on 1 Oct 2007, packed into bags, and stored in boxes
at the factory for about a month. The frozen gyoza was shipped on 2
Nov 2007, and arrived at Osaka Port 4 days later.

The gyoza that sickened 7 people from 2 families in Chiba Prefecture
was manufactured at the factory on 20 Oct 2007.

[Methamidophos has a number of other names including Monitor, Nitofol,
Tamaron, Swipe, Nuratron, Vetaron, Filitox, Patrole, Tamanox, SRA
5172, and Tam (1, 2). Methamidophos is also a breakdown product of the
organophosphate insecticide acephate (Orthene) (3, 4).

Tolerances for residues of methamidophos on raw agricultural products
range from 0.5 ppm in or on melons to 1.0 ppm in or on broccoli and
tomatoes.

Methamidophos is a highly active, systemic, residual organophosphate
insecticide/acaricide/avicide with contact and stomach action. Its
mode of action in insects and mammals is by decreasing the activity of
an enzyme important for nervous system function called
acetylcholinesterase. This enzyme is essential in the normal
transmission of nerve impulses. Methamidophos is a potent
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (5).

It is effective against chewing and sucking insects and is used to
control aphids, flea beetles, worms, whiteflies, thrips, cabbage
loopers, Colorado potato beetles, potato tubeworms, armyworms, mites,
leafhoppers, and many others. Crop uses include broccoli, Brussels
sprouts, cauliflower, grapes, celery, sugar beets, cotton, tobacco,
and potatoes. It is used outside the USA for many vegetables, hops,
corn, peaches, and other crops (6). Commercially available
formulations include soluble concentrate, emulsifiable concentrate,
wettable powder, granules, ultra-low volume spray, and water miscible
spray concentrate (4).

Generally, methamidophos is not considered phytotoxic if used as
directed, but defoliation has occurred when applied as foliar spray to
deciduous fruit. It is compatible with many other pesticides, but not
for use with alkaline materials (4). Methamidophos is slightly
corrosive to mild steel and copper alloys. This compound is highly
toxic to mammals, birds and bees.

Do not graze treated areas, and be sure to wear protective clothing
including respirator, chemical goggles, rubber gloves, and impervious
protective clothing (1, 2).

Early symptoms of acute organophosphate poisoning are dependent on
route of exposure, and usually develop during or shortly after
exposure (within 12 hours) (9). If inhaled, tightness in the chest,
wheezing, headache, blurred vision, pinpoint pupils, tearing and runny
nose are common early symptoms. If ingested, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and cramps are the most common early signs of poisoning.
Sweating and twitching in the area of absorption are seen with skin
exposure. Weakness, shakiness, blurred vision, tightness in the chest,
sweating, confusion, changes in heart rate, convulsions, coma, and
cessation of breathing may occur with significant inhalation,
ingestion or dermal exposure (9). An intermediate syndrome has been
described in cases of poisonings in Sri Lanka, where patients
experienced paralysis of limb, neck, and respiratory muscles 24-96
hours after exposure. Delayed neurological problems (delayed
peripheral neuropathy) have been described 2-4 weeks after large
exposures to organophosphates, and include a loss of feeling and pins
and needles type of pains in the feet, legs, and hands (10, 11).
Atropine is an antidote for organophosphate poisoning (9).

People with high blood pressure, gastrointestinal disorders, heart,
liver, lung, or nervous system problems may be more sensitive to
methamidophos. Reduced sperm count and sperm viability were seen in
men who were exposed to the product Tamaron in China. It may be weakly
mutagenic (12), but there is no evidence of carcinogenicity in tests
with rats and mice.

The primary target of organophosphate compounds is the nervous system.

Methamidophos is rapidly absorbed through the stomach, lungs, and
skin. It is eliminated primarily in the urine.
