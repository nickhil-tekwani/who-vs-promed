The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has called for urgent
controls on Wednesday to stop an Iraqi epidemic of Old World Screwworm
[_Cochliomya hominovorax_, a parasite potentially fatal to livestock, from
spreading to other Middle East countries.
It reported that some 50,000 animals were affected by the parasite in 12
out of Iraq's 18 governates in December alone; there had been 31,000
[animals affected in the previous 15 months. FAO said samples had been
found in Kuwait and Iran.
Old World Screwworm generally affects livestock, particularly sheep and
cattle, but can also spread to humans and FAO said a small number of cases
affecting people had been reported in Iraq.
A workshop organised by FAO and the Arab Organisation for Agricultural
Development in Syria in December recommended a two-year action plan to
tackle the pest using chemical insecticides, costing some $7.3 million. FAO
said it had already allocated $400,000 and the Netherlands had donated
$600,000. "Discussions are under way with financial institutions to raise
necessary funding for the action plan,".
Urgent action was needed to stop cross-border movement of infested animals.
Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Syria were seriously threatened and Bahrain,
Lebanon, Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen could also be at
risk.
