MAFF/UK Press Release
23 September 1998
SWEEPING CHANGES TO QUARANTINE LAW PROPOSED
The most radical and sweeping changes to the UK's quarantine laws for almost
a century have been proposed by a panel of experts.
The Government, as promised, wants the views of the public before taking
decisions on whether to change the rules. The main proposals, which are
based on a thorough risk assessment and the latest science, would allow pets
to travel to and from Britain, the EU and specified rabies free countries.
Quarantine would remain for animals from other countries.
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown said: "Professor Kennedy's report proposes
the most radical changes to our quarantine laws for almost a century. It is
an important piece of work.
"I am pleased to see that the report contains a thorough risk assessment of
the alternatives, and that the changes proposed to the current rules provide
a level of protection against rabies entering this country which would match
that which quarantine gives us now.
"I am sympathetic to change along the lines recommended by Professor
Kennedy's Advisory Group. We next want to hear views from the public and
interested organisations before deciding on a specific way forward.
"In any event, I am determined to make sure that the UK remains a
rabies-free country with strong safeguards against the disease. We also need
to look at how the new system would work in practice and how pet owners
would pay for it.
"I have today sent a consultation letter with a summary of the report's
recommendations to over 1000 organisations and individuals asking them for
their comments. Any member of the public can obtain both documents free from
the four UK Agriculture Departments. The documents have also been placed on
the Internet."
Agriculture Minister Nick Brown today published the report of the
independent Advisory Group on Quarantine which was set up by the Government
in October 1997 and chaired by Professor Ian Kennedy. At the same time Mr
Brown announced a public consultation on the options for change outlined in
the report titled Quarantine and Rabies: A Reappraisal.
The report contains a number of detailed recommendations for change. In the
main, they would allow pets to travel into the UK from other EU Member
States and specified rabies-free countries, as long as the animals had been
protected against rabies by vaccination, were identified by microchips,
blood tested and carried appropriate certificates to prove this. The system
would allow UK residents' pets to travel abroad to these countries with
their pets and return to the UK without any quarantine requirements.
However, the report also proposes that pet cats and dogs from other
countries should still be subject to a six month period in quarantine. The
report recommends that a sufficiently long period of up to three years
should be allowed for the introduction of the new system so that it can be
implemented effectively.
The consultation letter issued by the Government today asks the public to
consider:
* whether the proposed new system offers adequate safeguards against the
importation of rabies into the UK;
* how pet owners would be affected by the proposed new system;
* what should happen to those animals arriving at a UK port whose microchip
cannot be read, or whose paperwork is not in order ;
* the proposed timescale for implementation of up to 3 years;
* their views on the proposals for animals other than cats and dogs, where
non carnivores from European countries and rabies free islands would no
longer be subject to quarantine, carnivores would be subject to 6 months
quarantine, and bats would be subject to quarantine for life; and
* whether animals admitted to the UK under the new arrangements should be
treated against certain tapeworm and tick infestations not currently found
in the UK.
The public and interested organisations should submit their responses to the
proposals set out in the Advisory Group's report by 31 December 1998.

[If the Kennedy Report is so acceptible, one must ask why the Minister
believes he must now get input from the public, who had had the opportunity
of submitting evidence and comments to the Kennedy Committee. The Minister
must have been an academic at some point and subject to the infinite delays
provided by committees ... or an avid student of Jay's "Yes, Minister". By
the way, according to today's New York Times the UK quarantine
kennel/cattery industry has an annual turnover of $14.5 million. mod MHJ
