Central Darfur: 78 deaths
-------------------------
Issa Mohamed Moussa Ahmed, minister of health from Central Darfur, told Radio Dabanga that a total of 78 people died and 362 were infected with yellow fever [virus] in the state by Tuesday [27 Nov 2012].

On Monday [26 Nov 2012], Ahmed said that about 195 178 citizens had been vaccinated since the campaign started 3 days before. He pointed out to the intense presence of tribes' members in health centers and called for a larger turnout among the rest of the population.

West Darfur: [49 deaths]
------------------------
West Darfur, considered a stable state regarding the emergence of yellow fever cases, witnessed another fatal victim in the last few days, according to the state's Minister of Health Ahmed Ishaq Yaqub.

He said the latest death brought the amount of fatalities in the state to 49, adding that 177 people were diagnosed with the disease so far.

In addition, 3 new cases have been reported in the area of For Baranga, the minister revealed. He stressed that "all arrangements are now underway to immediately deliver vaccines to the population of the whole area."

Yaqub told Radio Dabanga that the vaccination rate in West Darfur reached 49 per cent in the last 5 days, noting that this figure does not include mobile units. He expected that in 7 days, by the end of the campaign, 100 percent of the population will have been vaccinated.

[This report gives the latest case and fatality counts in Central and West Darfur. It will be interesting to see if at least 80 per cent of the population can be vaccinated in the remaining 7 days of the campaign, and if that will be adequate to halt the outbreak throughout Darfur. So far, the proportion of the at-risk population vaccinated is promising.

Much of the original report above focuses on whether some of the cases acquired their infections in specific refugee camps, or were infected elsewhere and came to the camps when ill. This discussion is not included in this post, but can be see at the source URL above for those who are interested.
