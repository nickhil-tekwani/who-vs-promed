[1] Taiwan ex New Zealand: 1st imported measles case from NZ
Date: Wed 18 Sep 2019

Epidemic Intelligence Center Deputy Director Guo Hung-wei yesterday [17 Sep 2019] gave an update on the 1st case of measles imported from New Zealand at a news conference at the Centers for Disease Control in Taipei.

A man in his 20s living in southern Taiwan who visited New Zealand with his family from 14-24 Aug 2019 developed a fever on 1 Sep 2019 and sought medical attention at clinics 3 times before he developed a rash and sought treatment at a hospital on 5 Sep 2019 and again on 7 Sep 2019.

On his last visit, he was finally confirmed to have measles and hospitalized.

CDC physician Huang Wan-ting said the man had initially been diagnosed with a cold and a viral infection.

He is now back home, while the 601 people who had direct contact with him during the communicable period for measles will continue to be monitored until Wed [25 Sep 2019] next week, Huang said.

CDC Deputy Director-General Philip Lo said doctors might have erred in their initial diagnoses because most cases of imported measles have come from Southeast Asia, Europe or the US, so the doctors did not suspect measles even when the man told them he had recently visited New Zealand.

New Zealand is facing its worst measles outbreak in more than 22 years, with a total of 1275 cases confirmed as of Friday [13 Sep 2019], 165 cases in the past week alone, Huang said.

The CDC has issued a level-one travel notice -- the "Watch" level -- for measles in New Zealand, she added.

https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/new-zealand/2019/09/measles-outbreak-more-than-100-babies-hospitalised-after-contracting-measles-this-year.html


As of Fri [12 Sep 2019], 102 infants under a year-old have been hospitalised due to the measles, according to data from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research. There have been 176 confirmed cases in infants under 1 so far this year [2019].

32 babies under the age of 1 have contracted measles in the last week alone, amounting to 18 percent of the year's total.

Immunisation experts descend on Auckland to combat measles outbreak. New Zealand cases rise above 1000.

Anti-vaccination messages continue to spread amid New Zealand measles outbreak.

According to the figures, there have been 441 hospitalizations for measles nationwide.

Of the 176 babies who have contracted measles, 171 were not vaccinated.

In 2019 there have been 165 confirmed cases of measles in children aged 12 months - 2 years, 36 confirmed cases in children aged 3 - 4, 40 diagnoses in 5 - 9-year-olds and 250 cases among 20 - 29-year-olds.

There have been 175 confirmed cases in the 30 to 49 age group and only 19 diagnoses for 50-year-olds and over.

According to the figures, 633 people out of the 1275 cases were not vaccinated. 28 were partially vaccinated, and 75 were fully vaccinated.

Roughly 42 percent (539) of the 1275 people who have contracted measles nationwide did not know whether they were vaccinated or not.

No one has died of measles in New Zealand since the 1990s, but experts have claimed death is inevitable if the current outbreak isn't stopped. US data suggests around 1 or 2 people die for every 1000 infections.

"I think it's clear that some of the cases we've already had through our intensive care units would have died 20 or 30 years ago without the intensive treatment we've been able to provide," Starship Hospital clinical director Mike Shepherd told Newshub on Wed 18 Sep 2019.

A western Sydney man who has not recently travelled overseas has been diagnosed with measles, in the 2nd recent locally acquired case of the disease.

Two measles cases were previously confirmed on Sydney's northern beaches in September 2019.

The pair were travellers who brought the vaccine-preventable disease back from New Zealand, which is experiencing an outbreak.

NSW Health on Fri [20 Sep 2019] confirmed a man in his 30s had also picked up measles but had not been to New Zealand or elsewhere.

They said the man had this week been to several western Sydney suburbs, including Blacktown, Parramatta, Guildford, Wen2rthville and Kellyville. He had also visited the Sydney CBD.

They were now investigating the source of his illness.

https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/democratic-republic-congo-measles-outbreak-un-drc-authorities-dg


The DRC is facing a resurgence in measles cases. Nearly 180 000 suspected cases were reported in 2019. 76% of these are children under 5 and in the 3559 measles-associated deaths reported, they accounted for 88%.

The increase in cases and geographical spread of the measles outbreak has seen 484 out of 519 health zones affected. North Kivu and Ituri provinces, which are also struggling with an Ebola outbreak, are seeing a gradual increase in new measles cases, with an average of 297 cases per week in Ituri and 175 in North Kivu.

63% of confirmed cases had not been vaccinated (or their vaccination status could not be determined). According to the World Health Organisation, "the massive resurgence of measles in DRC is ... due to suboptimal routine immunisation coverage and inadequate implementation of supplementary immunisation activities". Another aggravating factor is high malnutrition among children.

A vaccination campaign in 63 health zones in April 2019 brought about a steady decline in new cases in these areas. Further vaccination campaigns are being prepared. USD 12.35 million is needed, with only USD 4 million available so far.

[5] WHO: warning
Date: Tue 17 Sep 2019

https://www.herald.co.zw/who-warns-of-dangerous-measles-comeback/


Zimbabwe will next week hold a national measles-rubella vaccination campaign for children under the age of 5, following a "dangerous" measles comeback, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has revealed.

Vitamin A supplementation will also be administered to children during the campaign.

In a report, WHO said the vaccinations and Vitamin A supplementation will be administered to children aged between 6 and 59 months on 23 - 27 Sep 2019.

WHO expressed concern over some of the irreversible effects of measles and rubella. According to WHO, measles is a preventable highly infectious viral illness that can lead to serious health complications such as lung and brain infections in children.

"Deafness, cataracts, heart defects mental retardation, and spleen damage are some of the irreversible birth defects caused by congenital rubella," read the report.

WHO warned of a dangerous measles come back last week set to affect many countries, including in Africa as cases have been increasing since the beginning of the year [2019].

"Every region in the world, except the Americas, is experiencing an increase in cases of measles, a vaccine-preventable disease that can kill or disable children," said WHO in a statement last week.

"Nearly 365 000 cases have been reported globally this year [2019], the highest figure since 2006, which represent only a fraction of the 6,7 million suspected cases. Measles caused an estimated 109 000 deaths in 2017 as shown by recent figures."

WHO blamed weak health systems and misinformation about vaccines for the measles comeback. It urged social media outlets and communities to make sure information about preventing the highly contagious disease is accurate.

According to WHO the biggest outbreak of measles is raging in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar and Ukraine.

[6] DRC
Date: Wed 18 Sep 2019

http://theconversation.com/over-3-000-killed-by-deadly-virus-in-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-this-year-and-its-not-ebola-123220


Ebola outbreaks, such as the current one in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which has claimed 2074 people's lives, are widely covered in the media. But another virus is ravaging the DRC with minimal publicity. That virus is measles.

Although measles has a much lower mortality rate than Ebola (around 2% compared with around 60%), there have been over 165 000 suspected cases of measles, with over 3200 deaths in the DRC since the start of 2019.

In a recent speech, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), said that he was "embarrassed to talk only about Ebola" in response to questions on recent developments in the DRC.

Measles is proving fatal at an alarming rate, far faster than Ebola. In the week ending 11 Aug 2019, 5600 cases were reported, with 141 deaths. Figures in the same week for Ebola were 63 confirmed cases and 45 deaths, meaning that, on average, measles is killing around 3 times as many people per week as Ebola. Thanks to the combination of rumours of Ebola being fabricated, conspiracies around vaccination programmes, and deeply held traditional beliefs, the difficulties in delivering aid don't appear to be ending any time soon.

The perception that the international response to measles is minimal compared with the effort mounted against Ebola also stirs mistrust and anger within the DRC. Measles poses less of a threat globally and specifically to wealthy countries, as vaccination programmes are widespread and effective (about 92% coverage in the US and about 86% globally). In contrast, isolated Ebola cases in the US and other wealthy countries during the 2013-16 West Africa epidemic caused widespread public fear and outcry.

For a vaccination programme to be effective, at least 92-95% of the population must be immunised; this creates so-called herd immunity. Another approach is ring vaccination.

This is where clusters of people who are particularly at risk are vaccinated. This approach can help to contain the spread of an outbreak, but with aid organisations facing attacks, community mistrust and under resourcing, even ring vaccination approaches are proving difficult to implement in both outbreaks.

Although Ebola poses a greater threat than measles in wealthy countries, within the DRC measles is causing more illness and death but has generated a smaller international response. The WHO has raised almost USD 114 million for combating the DRC Ebola outbreak, while barely USD 2.5 million has been raised to combat measles.

This is especially relevant when considering that an aspect of public resistance stems from the response teams only treating Ebola, whereas, from a community perspective, diseases such as measles and malaria are far greater threats to their lives. For example, malaria was responsible for over 27 000 deaths in the DRC in 2017.

How then should the international community respond to outbreaks to protect both the overall health of a community and the global spread of a specific disease? Perhaps the solution is as recently proposed by Doctors Without Borders and The Alliance for International Medical Action. They suggested that instead of the international community delivering targeted aid for only Ebola, resources should be deployed to strengthen local infrastructure and provide a decentralised capacity to provide care to all communities.

This may enable a country to contain an Ebola outbreak while still responding to outbreaks of other infectious and non-infectious diseases, providing better care for local communities. By using international resources to strengthen local infrastructure, it might be possible to create more resilient community health systems capable of responding to future outbreaks, possibly without needing international support.

[7] DRC: News Scan for 17 Sep 2019
Date: Tue 17 Sep 2019
Source: CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy) [abridged, edited]
http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2019/09/news-scan-Sep 2019-17-2019


A massive measles outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) accelerated again over the past few weeks, with spread to new areas, the World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office said yesterday [16 Sep 2019] in its weekly outbreaks and emergencies report.

Since the WHO's last update on the outbreak on 4 Aug 2019, the DRC has reported 72 607 more suspected cases, 1744 more deaths, and 24 newly affected health zones. Activity has peaked twice, in late April 2019 and in late July 2019. And since late August 2019, incidence has gradually been increasing, with 24 of the country's 26 provinces reporting measles cases during that period. Four hot spots, however, account for 45% of recent cases: Kwilu, Kasai, Kasai Central, and Kinshasa provinces.

Since 1 Jan 2019, the DRC has reported 179 477 suspected cases, including 3559 deaths. Of lab-confirmed patients, 63% had not been vaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Children younger than 5 are the hardest-hit group, making up 76% of the suspected cases and accounting for 88% of the deaths.

In the Ebola outbreak region, North Kivu and Ituri provinces have reported 3016 and 7765 cases this year [2019], respectively, with cases in both provinces gradually rising.

The WHO said the massive outbreak is likely due to an accumulation of susceptible children who weren't vaccinated during routine campaigns and were missed during supplemental vaccine campaigns that were held in the wake of outbreaks. It recommends that the country speed the process of implementing the 2nd vaccine dose and strengthen routine vaccination, supplemental vaccination, and surveillance.

https://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html


From 1 Jan to 19 Sep 2019, 1241 individual cases of measles have been confirmed in 31 states. Two new cases were reported 13-19 Sep 2019. However, 2 cases previously reported were determined to not have been measles cases. Therefore, the national case count remains at 1241

-This is the greatest number of cases reported in the U.S. since 1992. More than 75% of the cases this year [2019] are linked to outbreaks in New York. Measles is more likely to spread and cause outbreaks in U.S. communities where groups of people are unvaccinated.

-The majority of cases are among people who were not vaccinated against measles.

-Measles can cause serious complications. As of 19 Sep 2019, 131 of the people who got measles this year [2019] were hospitalized, and 65 reported having complications, including pneumonia and encephalitis.

States with Reported Measles Cases (as of 19 Sep 2019)

The states that have reported cases to CDC are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Mexico, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington. All measles cases this year [2019] have been caused by measles wild-type D8 or B3.

Ongoing Measles Outbreaks Reported to CDC

Measles outbreaks (defined as 3 or more cases) are currently ongoing in 2019 in the following jurisdiction:
New York State, Rockland County: These outbreaks are linked to travelers who brought measles back from other countries such as Israel, Ukraine, and the Philippines, where large measles outbreaks are occurring.
On 3 Sep 2019, health officials declared that the measles outbreak in New York City has ended.
On 12 Sep 2019, health officials declared that the measles outbreak in El Paso, TX has ended.
On 19 Sep 2019, it was determined that the measles outbreak in Wyoming County, NY has ended.

An infected adult traveled on the LIRR between Mineola and New York Penn Station on 2 days last week.

The health department issued a warning to New York residents on Thu 19 Sep 2019 about a newly confirmed case of measles that poses a risk of "potential exposure to the public." And if you rode the Long Island Rail Road last week, you'll want to know about this one.

The Nassau County Department of Health says a 2nd case of measles has been confirmed in recent weeks, and the individual traveled into New York City on several occasions between 11 and 14 Sep 2019.

According to the NCDOH, the affected adult traveled on the LIRR [on the dates and times given at the URL above.] The newly confirmed case of measles comes 2 weeks after the health department announced an additional case of measles on 4 Sep 2019. The NCDOH says the 1st case showed "minimal risk of exposure" to residents in the county.

The patient identified by the health department on 4 Sep 2019 had recently arrived in the state on an international flight into JFK International Airport and had been exposed to measles in another county, the department said.

This case was announced one day after New York health officials declared that an outbreak concentrated in Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods had ended.

In June 2019, state lawmakers revoked a religious exemption for mandatory school vaccinations amid the nation's worst measles outbreak since 1992. More than 26 000 children in public and private schools and day care centers had previously gone unvaccinated for religious reasons, according to the state Health Department.

More than 1200 cases of measles have been confirmed in 30 states this year [2019] with more than 3/4ths of them linked to outbreaks in New York and New York City, the Centers for Disease Control reported.

Reviews signal note of caution on early measles vaccination
Two systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases report a good immune response and protection when the measles vaccine is administered before 9 months of age, but not as good as when given later, and the early 1st dose might affect how later doses perform.

Lower protection with earlier immunization In the 1st meta-analysis, researchers from the Netherlands and the World Health Organization (WHO) looked at data from 56 studies on safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy/effectiveness of measles-containing vaccines (MCVs) administered to infants younger than 9 months. An initial dose (called MCV1) is currently recommended at 9 months of age in countries with ongoing measles transmission, and at 12 months in countries with low risk of measles, with a 2nd dose administered at 4 to 6 years.

In infants who received a dose before 9 months, the vaccine was found to be safe and well-tolerated, according the pooled data. The pooled vaccine effectiveness of MCV1 in infants younger than 9 months against measles was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 9% to 80%). The pooled vaccine effectiveness estimate from within-study comparisons of infants younger than 9 months vaccinated with MCV1 was 51% (95% CI, 44% to 83%), and for those aged 9 months and older at vaccination, it was 83% (95% CI, 76% to 88%), the authors said.

The authors concluded, "A large proportion of infants receiving MCV1 before 9 months of age are protected and the vaccine is safe, although higher antibody titres and vaccine effectiveness are found when MCV1 is administered at older ages. Recommending MCV1 administration to infants younger than 9 months for those at high risk of measles is an important step towards reducing measles-related mortality and morbidity."

The results of this analysis were presented to the WHO in 2015, and they resulted in updated WHO recommendations on MCV administration at 6 months of age for infants at high risk of measles infection.

Possible effect on later doses
In the 2nd analysis, the same group of researchers looked at the effect early vaccine dosing has on subsequent immune responses to the standard vaccine doses. In 13 studies, the pooled proportion of infants seropositive after 2 MCV doses, with MCV1 administered before 9 months of age, was 98% (95% CI, 96% to 99%), not significantly different from seropositivity after a 2-dose MCV schedule starting later (P = 0.087).

"We also found some evidence that MCV1 administered to infants younger than 9 months resulted in lower antibody titres after 1 or 2 subsequent doses of MCV than when measles vaccination is started at age 9 months or older," the authors said. "The clinical and public-health relevance of this immunity blunting effect are uncertain."

This uncertainty "suggests that an early dose might decrease long-term protection because further doses were associated with reduced antibody titres and avidity," write Nicola Principi, MD, and Susanna Esposito, MD, both with the University of Milan, in an accompanying commentary on the 2 studies.

"Compared with infants administered MCV at 9 months of age or later, seroconversion and antibody concentrations in those vaccinated before 9 months of age were significantly reduced. Vaccine effectiveness was 51% versus 83%, highlighting that a substantial proportion of infants younger than 9 months remained susceptible to measles, and that only further doses could ensure that all infants were protected," they said.

Ultimately, a 3-dose vaccine schedule would be difficult and costly to implement, as the current 2-dose schedule already sees poor adherences, Principi and Esposito conclude [see below]. A 3rd dose of MCV administered in early infancy should be considered only in emergency situations, they add.

Commentary
Citation. Principi N and Esposito S. Early vaccination: a provisional measure to prevent measles in infants
Published: 20 Sep 2019. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/S1473-3099(19)30520-1

The optimal age for measles-containing vaccine (MCV) administration depends on various factors, mainly the duration of the protection induced by transplacentally acquired maternal immunity, the maturity of the infant's immune system, and the average age of measles infection in different geographical areas.

Demographics and vaccine coverage also contribute.
Initially, experts thought that if an area had a high risk of measles outbreaks, a 1st dose of MCV at 9 months of age could be enough to protect most infants, as those younger than 9 months could avoid infection through transplacentally acquired immunity. Subsequently, it was shown that this supposition was partly wrong, as many measles cases, sometimes very severe, were diagnosed in infants younger than 6 months.

This finding was attributed to a shorter-than-expected duration (9-12 months) of passive maternal immunity, evidenced in both infants born from immunised mothers and those born from mothers with naturally acquired immunity. It was shown that vaccination stimulated the immune system less than natural infection, and infants born from vaccinated mothers had lower specific antibody titres with more rapidly waning protection than infants born from naturally infected mothers.

Nevertheless, with the introduction of MCV administration, the circulation of measles virus progressively declined, and without this natural booster, even previously naturally infected mothers transferred reduced antibody concentrations to their fetuses.

To address the problem of measles infection in young infants, an early MCV dose before 9 months of age was suggested. Infants living in or travelling to countries with frequent measles outbreaks, or considered at risk because of HIV exposure or infection, and refugees or people living in conflict zones were the target populations. However, because of the risk that an early MCV dose could lead to poor short-term and long-term protection, this dose was considered only supplemental. Infants vaccinated before 9 months of age had to receive the usual 2 doses at scheduled times to achieve long-term protection.

Unfortunately, the real effect of an early MCV dose has not been definitively established. Attempts to fill this gap have been made by Laura Nic Lochlainn and colleagues with 2 systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases

The results indicate that MCV administration before 9 months of age is safe and immunogenic.

Moreover, early immunisation did not blunt the immune response to subsequent MCV doses.

Consequently, the authors concluded that administration of MCV to infants younger than 9 months can be an effective solution to reduce measles-related morbidity and mortality in a substantial proportion of infants at risk.

However, the results of Nic Lochlainn and colleagues strongly suggest that MCV administration before 9 months of age must only be considered as an emergency solution to contain or prevent outbreaks and cannot replace either scheduled dose. Compared with infants administered MCV at 9 months of age or later, seroconversion and antibody concentrations in those vaccinated before 9 months of age were significantly reduced. Vaccine efficacy was 51% versus 83%, highlighting that a substantial proportion of infants younger than 9 months remained susceptible to measles, and that only further doses could ensure that all infants were protected. Moreover, analysis of the immunogenicity and efficacy of further doses, despite showing that MCV efficacy and cell-mediated responses to a 2nd and a 3rd dose were independent of the age of the 1st dose, suggests that an early dose might decrease long-term protection because further doses were associated with reduced antibody titres and avidity. Further studies are needed to solve the problem of reduced long-term immunity after early MCV administration. In the meantime, WHO's recommendations on vaccination must be followed.

The need for a 3-dose regimen presents organisational and economic difficulties, particularly in low-income countries. Only countries with well-established immunisation programmes can rely on routine services to deliver the 2nd and 3rd doses. Together with additional expenses, which are difficult to sustain in low-income countries, the uptake of routine vaccination after receipt of an early dose can be suboptimal. Although data on vaccination uptake in developing countries are insufficient, a Canadian study showed that approximately 20% of early-vaccinated children, mainly in low-income families, did not receive further doses at the appropriate time.

The most important obstacle to measles elimination by 2020 in 5 of the 6 WHO-targeted regions is the poor vaccination coverage in countries where measles had been nearly eradicated. Coverage with 2 doses at recommended ages was less than 95% in 96·5% of European countries, and the prevalence of measles protection according to antibody titres was significantly lower than the herd immunity threshold in these countries (76% vs 95%).

Similar suboptimal vaccination coverage was seen in several other countries outside Europe, including the USA.

Circulation of measles virus among adolescents and adults predominantly affects unvaccinated young infants. Only total compliance to recommendations can solve the problem of poor vaccination coverage.
