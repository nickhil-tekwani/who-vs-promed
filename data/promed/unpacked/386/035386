INFECTION CONTROL - FRANCE
==========================
Date: 25 Jun 96 10:36:37 EDT
From: Bruno Coignard <100564.1671@CompuServe.COM>

I liked your recent series about Infection Control!
I use Internet for more than two years now, but this is not common for all
the physicians here in France.
Concerning MRSA, VRE and MDR-Tb rates, you have to know that I'm just actually
a resident in Public Health here at the University Hospital. Despite my
strong interest in such sharing of experience, I haven't got any authority
to publish these rates myself.
******REQUEST***********
I'm actually writing a paper for a French journal about Hospital Infections,
a paper about 'Hygiene hospitaliere et Internet' (Infection control and the
use of Internet).
I've got specific bookmarks on this subject, but I'm afraid of forgetting
some useful and important Internet links in Infection Controls
(Web sites, mailing-lists, newsgroups, ...etc.):
CDC and ProMED-mail are of course in this bookmark,
but I would be glad if you could help me.
Have you some specific bookmarks concerning Infection Control?
Or do you know somebody who could help me for this inventory?
Of course, I would quote the helper for this inventory in my paper.
Thanks in advance for your help.
