FMD in Israel, 2004
-------------------
5 FMD outbreaks (7 farms in 5 settlements) have been recorded in Israel so
far in 2004 up to the report's date (18 Mar 2004; the day the 5th outbreak
was reported). It seems that 4 farms in 3 settlements shared a common
infection source, namely a truck recently used for the transportation of
livestock from Israel to a neighbouring territory. The remaining 3 foci
were secondary. All affected bovines were young animals, previously
vaccinated (only) once. The symptoms were mild and no mortality was recorded.
Tongue epithelium samples were forwarded to the FMD laboratory at the
Kimron Veterinary Institute (KVI) and found, by the initial ELISA test, to
be infected with FMD virus serotype O1. Subsequently, the virus was grown
on pig kidney cells tissue culture and SNT performed. It was shown that all
isolates were serologically closely related to the Geshur FMDV serotype,
which is included in the vaccine applied in Israel and thus provides a good
level of protection.
According to nucleotide sequencing, covering the first 4 outbreaks, it
could be concluded that all had a common source. The VPI sequencing of the
2004 virus had a 10 percent deviation from isolates, received from the
Palestinian authority in 2002 and 2003. It has also become apparent that
previous FMD outbreaks in Israel -- 1994, 1996, 1999, as well as the
current, 2004 outbreak -- had different sources. It seems reasonable to
assume that FMD outbreaks in Israel are caused by separate virus
introductions.
3 current FMDV Israeli isolates have been genetically analysed by the World
Reference Laboratory for FMD (WRLFMD) at Pirbright, UK. The "Unrooted Neigbor-
joining tree" produced shows that the Israeli strains belong to the "PanAsia"
group and are closely related to recent Lebanese and Turkish FMDV O isolates
(O/LEB/1/2003, O/TUR/6/2003, O/TUR/7/2003).

central role in promoting those ends. - Mod.AS]
