[1] Vaccine: antibody response in survivors vs uninfected
Date: Fri 26 Mar 2021 12:54 EDT

Coronavirus survivors who get vaccinated respond up to 7 times better to it than those who haven't had the virus, a study has found.

Researchers found that antibody levels were 3 times higher in people who had the virus and then one dose of Pfizer's jab, compared with someone who had never been infected but had 2 doses of the same vaccine. The difference was even bigger when they looked at people who had never caught COVID and were given only one dose.

But the experts claimed the single dose produced a "robust" immune response in 99% of people. They said levels of protection are even stronger after the top-up jab, underlining the importance of people coming forward for their 2nd shot.

Data showed the jabs offered a "breadth" of immune response, leaving experts confident that the current crop of vaccines should be effective against the [variant from South Africa] and other mutant strains. The findings support the UK policy of rapid roll-out of one dose of vaccine to provide cover as quickly as possible for millions of Britons in higher-risk groups, researchers say.

The study was done on 237 health workers in Sheffield, Oxford, Liverpool, Newcastle and Birmingham. Most volunteers were female. It measured levels of both antibodies and T-cells, which are substances used by the immune system to destroy the coronavirus. Higher levels generally mean stronger immunity.

Scientists found that, after one dose of the vaccine, people who had been infected with COVID in the past had 6.8 times as many antibodies in their blood as those who had not. They had 2.9 times as many antibodies after one dose as people who had not been infected but who had been given 2 jabs, the total vaccine course.

But the experts said 2nd doses are still needed for everyone because the booster is thought to make immunity last for longer.

The study comes after findings in the last few months showed antibody responses after one dose are significantly higher in people who had survived COVID. The new study, named Protective Immunity from T-cells to COVID in Health workers (PITCH), was published online.

In it, 113 people who had previously caught the coronavirus and 103 who had never been infected were given one dose of Pfizer's vaccine. And 21 healthcare workers who had not previously had the virus were given 2 jabs. No COVID survivors were given both doses.

[Data from this study indicate that vaccination of previously infected individuals not only boosts their immune responses but also broadens the repertoire of immune responses to SARS-CoV-2. So theoretically the vaccination should enhance the response to several variants of concern, including those from Kent (UK), South Africa and Brazil.

"The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) has issued interim recommendations for the use of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson) COVID-19 vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 in the USA. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines encoding the prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The Janssen vaccine is a recombinant replication-incompetent adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector encoding the stabilized prefusion spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2. None of the currently authorized COVID-19 vaccines are live virus vaccines" (https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html).

The above report highlights the importance of vaccinating everyone, including people who have already been infected, albeit with a deferral of the shots after the acute infectious period and extending up to 90 days. Furthermore, a 2nd vaccine shot is crucial for longer-term protection, regardless of whether someone has previously had COVID-19. Also, because these vaccines are brand new, we don't know how long the immunity they provide will last.

Lastly, COVID-19 vaccines are not currently recommended for outbreak management or for post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in a person with a known exposure. Because the median incubation period of COVID-19 is 4-5 days, it is unlikely that a dose of COVID-19 vaccine would provide an adequate immune response within the incubation period for effective post-exposure prophylaxis. - Mod.UBA]

[2] Influenza vaccine and COVID-19
Date: Wed 24 Mar 2021

https://www.sciencealert.com/flu-shots-linked-to-drop-in-covid-19-infections-and-scientists-aren-t-sure-why/amp?__twitter_impression=true


Getting a flu shot is not the same thing as getting a COVID-19 vaccination. If it were, the world would be in a very different place right now. Still, a new study released by health researchers in Michigan has arrived at an intriguing finding, and it's one the scientists can't as yet fully explain.

In an analysis of medical records from over 27 000 patients in Michigan who got tested for COVID-19 by July 2020, patients who had received an influenza vaccine within the previous year were significantly less likely to test positive for the coronavirus than those who hadn't. Significantly, yes -- but not by a large amount.

All up, of the 27 201 patients in the study who got tested for COVID-19, 1218 tested positive, representing 4.5% of the cohort. It's worth bearing in mind that's an average figure, accounting for both the patients who had and hadn't gotten a flu shot.

When you break the numbers down further, though, a small but significant contrast emerges in the data, in terms of the chance of getting a positive COVID-19 test, and that's after controlling for variables like ethnicity, race, gender, age, and other health-related factors.

In the Michigan cohort, only 4% of those who had received a flu vaccine tested positive for COVID-19; meanwhile, among those who hadn't received a flu shot, the share of positive COVID-19 cases was 4.9%.

That doesn't sound like much, but the researchers also summarize the data thus: The odds of testing positive for COVID-19 were reduced in patients who received a flu shot by about 24% compared with those who didn't get vaccinated against influenza in the previous year. That sounds notable, even if the overall effect is relatively small compared with the amount of protection an actual COVID-19 vaccine delivers.

Still, why does it happen at all? It might not actually reflect a mechanism of the flu vaccine, researchers say, so much as an effect of bias in the data, due to the behavior of people who choose to get vaccinated. But in truth we just don't know for sure.

"It is possible that patients who receive their flu vaccine are also people who are practicing more social distancing and following CDC guidelines," says cardiologist Marion Hofmann Bowman from the University of Michigan. "However, it is also plausible that there could be a direct biological effect of the flu vaccine on the immune system relevant for the fight against SARS-CoV-2 virus."

What is certain is that this isn't the 1st time we've seen this apparent protective effect against COVID-19 in retrospective data. A number of studies worldwide have found evidence of the same link, and the effect seems to go beyond just whether or not people test positive.

In the Michigan study, patients who had a flu shot were also less likely to require hospitalization and the assistance of ventilators. In other studies, having or not having a flu vaccination appears to affect mortality risk too, although that wasn't seen here. If an actual mechanism of the flu shot is somehow protecting people -- and again, there's no evidence of that here -- what might it be?

The researchers speculate a plausible immunologic mechanism could be a process called trained immunity, in which exposure to pathogens (in this case, in vaccine form) hypothetically primes the immune system to respond to other threats. "This 'heterologous immunity' could explain the nonspecific cross-reactivity that vaccines have against unrelated pathogens," the researchers explain, emphasizing that further research is needed to discern whether such a phenomenon is occurring here.

In any case, while we don't yet fully understand why this is happening (and need to keep looking into it), this is nonetheless another good thing about flu shots -- especially in a time of pandemic, no less. "While the largest benefit to health from the influenza vaccine comes from prevention of influenza, the ancillary potential benefit of COVID-19 protection may provide enough impetus for hesitant patients to get vaccinated," the authors write.

"Even if the direct link between the prevention of COVID-19 and the influenza vaccine is minimal, through an overall reduction in the number of patients presenting...or requiring hospitalization for complications of influenza, vaccination will preserve healthcare resources for those with COVID-19."

Citation: Conlon A, Ashur C, Washer L, et al. Impact of the influenza vaccine on COVID-19 infection rates and severity. Am J Infect Control. Epub 22 Feb 2021. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajic.2021.02.012

"Highlights: With vaccines against COVID-19 not yet broadly available, there is interest in assessing the role of the influenza vaccine in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. The odds of testing positive for COVID-19 [were] reduced in patients who received an influenza vaccine compared to those who did not by 24%. Vaccinated patients testing positive for COVID-19 were less likely to require hospitalization or mechanical ventilation and had a shorter hospital length of stay. The influenza vaccine should be promoted to reduce the burden of COVID-19.

"Background: With a unique influenza season occurring in the midst of a pandemic, there is interest in assessing the role of the influenza vaccine in COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.

"Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, patients receiving a laboratory test for COVID-19 were identified. The primary outcome was comparison of positive COVID-19 testing in those who received the influenza vaccine versus those who did not. Secondary end points in patients testing positive for COVID-19 included mortality, need for hospitalization, length of stay, need for intensive care, and mechanical ventilation.

"Results: A total of 27 201 patients received laboratory testing for COVID-19. The odds of testing positive for COVID-19 [were] reduced in patients who received an influenza vaccine compared to those who did not (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.68-0.86; P less than 0 .001). Vaccinated patients testing positive for COVID-19 were less likely to require hospitalization (odds ratio 0.58, 95% CI 0.46-0.73; P  less than 0.001) or mechanical ventilation (odds ratio 0.45, 95% CI 0.27-0.78; P  = 0.004) and had a shorter hospital length of stay (risk ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.89; P less than 0.001).

"Conclusion: Influenza vaccination is associated with decreased positive COVID-19 testing and improved clinical outcomes and should be promoted to reduce the burden of COVID-19."

Interesting finding, but more data are needed to distinguish between behavioral and immunologic causation. That said, cross-protection is possible if a vaccine elicits a good adaptive T-cell response, but it is a little complicated and depends on the individual. It also has been observed before that "our innate immune system has an element of memory (referred to above and in the literature as) "trained immunity," and some vaccines trigger this memory response, Dr. Kirsty Short (virologist at the University of Queensland) says.

"'For a period after vaccination, and we don't know how long, you tend to be a little bit protected because your immune system is switched on. Mostly, it's live vaccines that seem to do it, like the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine and live polio vaccine.'

"It's a concept being explored by Nigel Curtis, paediatric infectious diseases physician and scientist at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and the University of Melbourne. He and his team are running an international clinical trial to determine if the tuberculosis vaccine -- called Bacillus Calmette-Guerin or BCG -- can help protect against severe COVID-19 in healthcare workers.

"The BCG vaccine contains live but weakened bacteria that stimulate the immune system, but without causing disease. While it helps prevent tuberculosis, it also protects against a wide range of other diseases.

"And it's only in the past decade that immunologists have unpicked some of the mechanisms behind it. Very simply, the BCG vaccine induces metabolic changes in some of the cells involved in the innate immune system, and this affects how they express certain genes.

"Overall, it means your innate immune response better deals with any subsequent infections, Professor Curtis says. 'The idea is that you have BCG, and you induce these changes, then when you get infected with SARS-CoV-2, your response to that virus or any virus -- because it's completely agnostic to pathogen -- is stronger than it would be in someone who hadn't previously had BCG.'

"Because it's a general enhancement, it's not technically cross-protection, and the BCG vaccine should not [be] considered a replacement for COVID-19 vaccines, he adds. Instead, it's something that may stop you from becoming severely ill, should you be infected" (excerpted from https://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2021-01-20/covid-19-immune-system-common-cold-coronavirus-cross-protection/13056718).

Flu vaccine may trigger a similar response. This would be an intriguing bonus to getting a flu shot but should not be depended upon to replace the coronavirus vaccine. - Mod.LK]

India saw 59 118 new coronavirus infections in a day, the highest single day rise so far this year [2021].

Indian vaccine supplies to lower income countries are being delayed "as the Government of India battles a new wave of COVID-19 infections," according to Global vaccine alliance GAVI, which runs the COVAX programme.

A statement from GAVI said that while it had received 28 million Covishield doses from the Serum Institute of India (SII), it was unclear about additional supplies of 40 million in March and 50 million in April [2021], and was in talks with the government and SII over the issue.

SII CEO Adar Poonawalla had sounded an alarm in early March [2021] over the shortage of raw materials needed from the USA, which the Biden administration has now requisitioned for the American production of the Pfizer vaccines. Mr. Poonawalla is understood to have written to authorities in Brazil, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia, explaining that a number of reasons, including the fire in SII facilities in January [2021], had held up supplies.

India saw 59 118 new coronavirus infections in a day, the highest single day rise so far this year [2021], taking the nationwide COVID-19 tally to 11 846 652, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Friday [26 Mar 2021].

The active caseload breached the 4-lakh [400 000] mark again after around 3.5 months. Registering an increase for the 16th day in row, the active cases have increased to 421 066, comprising 3.55% of the total infections, while the recovery rate has further dropped to 95.09%, the data stated.

The 59 118 new infections reported in a span of 24 hours were the highest since 18 Oct 2020. The death toll increased to 160 949 with 257 daily new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed.

Maharashtra
In its highest-ever surge, Maharashtra reported 35 952 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday [25 Mar 2021], as its active case tally breached the 2.50-lakh [250 000] mark to shoot to 262 685.

As many as 20 444 patients were discharged in the last 24 hours. The State's recovery rate dipped to 87.78%. A record 1.53 lakh [153 000] samples were tested.

A high fatality spike of 111 deaths pushed the death toll to 53 795.

Gujarat
Gujarat on Thursday [25 Mar 2021] reported its biggest single-day spike in COVID-19 cases with 1961 new infections and 7 deaths, taking the fatality count to 4473. Within a week, the daily infection count has doubled, prompting fears about whether the 2nd wave will be as deadly as the 1st.

As on Thursday, the number of active cases has gone up to 9372 of whom 81 patients are critically infected and put on ventilator support. The main cities, Ahmedabad and Surat, have 551 and 501 cases, respectively, contributing over 50% of the cases.

Tamil Nadu
C. Vijayabaskar, AIADMK's candidate for the Viralimalai constituency, led the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic as Health Minister. A qualified doctor, he has been projecting his performance during what he calls a trying time for the people, to solicit votes for the upcoming Assembly election. With a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases in the State, he discusses preparatory measures underway to contain it and future prospects for the constituency.

"We are looking to curb the transmission from the primary sources. Measures to avoid overcrowding, including the closure of schools and colleges, are being taken. Public cooperation is essential to control the spread of the infection. A lockdown, as was done last year [2020], is not being considered as of now," he says.

https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2021/03/25/india-locks-down-some-towns-as-coronavirus-cases-hit-5-month-high.html


Authorities ordered people indoors in some towns in western India as the number of new coronavirus infections hit 53 476 infections overnight, the highest in 5 months, data showed on Thursday [25 Mar 2021].

Cases have surged across several states since late February [2021], following a near-full reopening of the economy and flouting of safety measures such as the wearing of face masks and social distancing, health officials say. More than half the new infections were reported from western Maharashtra state, home to financial capital Mumbai, where millions have returned to work in offices and factories.

The local government imposed a full lockdown for 10 days in the worst-affected towns Nanded and Beed following a cabinet meeting, an official said. "It was suggested to allow local administration to impose localized lockdowns instead of imposing lockdown across the state," said a senior government official who declined to be named, referring to comments made during the meeting.

Maharashtra has also reported a new variant of the virus, called a "double mutant," adding to concerns about the surge in cases.

India's overall case load stands at 11.8 million, the 3rd-highest behind the United States and Brazil. The country reported 251 new deaths, taking the overall tally to 160 692, data showed.

Businesses have been urging governments to ease curbs in the run-up to the big Hindu festival of Holi this weekend. Restrictions have been lifted in the city of Nagpur in Maharashtra and large crowds have been seen in shopping areas, state police said.

"It is a Catch-22 wherein closure of shops led to a lot of inconvenience for traders and people but on the other side is COVID, which is spreading," police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told Reuters.
