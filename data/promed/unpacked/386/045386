A man and more than 20 head of cattle died in Arbaat in Red Sea state on Thursday and Friday [3 & 4 Oct 2019] of an "unknown fever". So far, 3 people and 420 cows have died of the unknown disease that hit the area of Arbaat, north of Port Sudan, over the past weeks, medical doctor Ahmed Dereir told Radio Dabanga on Friday [4 Oct 2019].

The symptoms of the disease are high fever among people, and bleeding and abortion among cows, he said. The Preventive Medicine Society advised the people not to drink milk and burn dead cattle before burial.

Teams of the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Sudanese Preventive Medicine Society have arrived in the region to investigate the epidemic. Activists have criticised the Red Sea state government for not making its findings on the epidemic public, despite taking samplings for research more than a week ago.

In mid-September [2019], the Sudanese Ministry of Health reported 22 suspected cases of haemorrhagic fever in eastern Sudan's Kassala. Later, this month [October 2019], Radio Dabanga reported the death of 10 people in El Fasher, capital of North Darfur, because of dengue fever, haemorrhagic fever, chikungunya fever, and fever caused by malaria.

[High fever among people could occur coincidentally with a disease in cattle; however, such synchronization could be indicative of a common zoonotic pathogen. In view of the signs reported to be observed in cattle, particularly abortions and deaths, one of the diseases to be taken into consideration in the described event is Rift Valley fever (RVF). The 1st outbreak of RVF in Sudan was reported in 1973 among sheep and cattle in the White Nile State. In 1977, camels from Sudan were one of the suggested sources of RVF virus introduced, for the 1st time, into Egypt. Throughout the years, this virus was reported several times from humans and animals in Sudan. In 2010, seroepidemiologic survey revealed a high prevalence of RVFV IgG among febrile patients admitted to New Halfa Hospital in Kassala State (Ref. 1).

More detail on the symptoms of the current human disease, and results of the investigations said to be undertaken by WHO and the Sudanese Preventive Medicine Society, are anticipated. The investigating teams are expected to include veterinarians; testing animal tissues should enhance the diagnosis.
