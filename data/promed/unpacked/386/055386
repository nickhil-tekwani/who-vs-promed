After failing to reach its target of being rabies free by 2012, the provincial administration has revised its target to 2015 due to the re-emergence of rabies cases throughout 2013. "We have had to correct our previous target to eliminate rabies in Bali to the year 2015," said Ketut Suarjaya, head of Bali Health Agency, on Thursday [19 Dec 2013]. Initially, the administration was optimistic about achieving its 2015 rabies-free target. "But there was a human casualty in September 2013, making it hard for us to reach the target," said Suarjaya. There had been no cases of human rabies infection since July 2012.

However, in September [2013] a boy was found to have died from rabies. "Bali can only declare itself rabies-free if there is no single case of rabies in humans or animals within a 2-year period." In addition to the one human casualty, rabies still infects numerous dogs in Gianyar, Bangli and Buleleng regencies.

The 1st rabies outbreak in Bali occurred in 2008, starting in Ungasan village. That year, 4 cases of human infection with rabies were recorded. This increased in 2009 to 48 cases and 82 in 2010. After the mass animal vaccination program launched in Bali, rabies cases in humans started to decrease. In 2011, 24 cases were recorded, and by 2012, only 8 cases had occurred. Previously, Bali had targeted eliminating rabies by 2012.

This year [2013], [a 12-year-old boy] from Buyan hamlet, Pancasari village in Buleleng, died on 9 Sep after a dog had bitten him 3 months earlier. "After the dog bite, the boy did not get the rabies vaccination thinking that it was only a minor bite. We were so disappointed; anyone who gets bitten by a dog must get the vaccination immediately," Suarjaya said. He said that the administration had provided and distributed adequate human rabies vaccines to many public hospitals and community health centers to be used free of charge. "We now have at least 8000 vials of rabies vaccines for humans. Next week, we will receive another 41 000 vaccines. So, we have enough," Suarjaya said.

Rabies vaccinations for both animals and humans have been distributed and available free-of-charge since the 1st rabies case was reported in Bali in 2008. The administration allocated a special budget to handle the issue. The human vaccines are available at some community health centers, Sanglah Hospital and 9 regional hospitals. In private hospitals and clinics, the vaccine is available for INR 130 000 [about USD 10.82] per injection. "We will continue to provide free vaccines as long as needed," Suarjaya said.

The number of dog bite cases decreased during 2013, said Suarjaya, with around 100 to 110 bites per day throughout the year. In 2012, dog bite cases reached an average 130 bites per day. To achieve the rabies-free target in 2015 is not an impossible task "as long as people are aware of the importance of getting their dogs vaccinated and not letting unvaccinated dogs roam freely."

[The failure to achieve complete eradication of rabies virus infection from both canines and humans on the Indonesian island of Bali is disappointing but not entirely unexpected. Adequate supplies of vaccine appear to be available now. Surveillance, however, will remain a problem.

Visitors to the island of Bali should be aware of the continuing problem of canine and human rabies and should take care to avoid free-roaming canines and to seek vaccination immediately if bitten.
