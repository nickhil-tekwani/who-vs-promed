Lethal parrot disease may be caused by horse virus
--------------------------------------------------
A devastating parrot disease that has pushed one species to the brink
of extinction might be spread by a newly-discovered virus.
Proventricular dilatation disease -- PDD for short -- deadens the
nerve cells that control the oesophagus and stomach. "Birds can't
grind the seeds or digest their food properly, and they waste away,"
says avian veterinarian Susan Clubb, of the Rainforest Clinic for
Birds and Exotics in Loxahatchee, Florida. Veterinarians 1st spotted
the disease in macaws exported from Bolivia in the 1970s. The illness
now afflicts dozens of species of psittacines -- the group that
includes parrots and cockatoos -- as well as macaws. Only about 70
Spix's macaws survive today, none of them in the wild. This is in
part due to PDD, Clubb says.

Scientists have long suspected that a virus causes PDD. Outbreaks of
the disease occur frequently, especially in indoor aviaries, and
infected tissue can transmit the disease from bird to bird. But
efforts to identify the cause have turned up dead ends and
non-replicable results. Clubb, who treats birds with PDD, including
captive Spix's macaws, sent biopsy samples to a team of virus hunters
at the University of California, San Francisco. Amy Kistler, a
molecular biologist there, also gathered samples from veterinarians in Israel.

Using a "virus chip" that can identify hundreds of different viruses
lurking in a sample, Kistler's team found sequences matching one kind
of virus in two-thirds of the PDD-positive parrot biopsies, and none
of the negative samples. When Kistler's team sequenced viruses in
parrot tissue, they uncovered 16 completely new strains of borna
viruses. These typically infect the brains and nerves of horses,
causing "sad horse disease" because infected equines become listless
and eventually paralysed.

However, the genomes of the newly-discovered parrot viruses only
vaguely resemble those of horse borna viruses, suggesting the new
strains might be specific to birds, Kistler says. Even the parrot
viruses vary substantially from one another, and it's unclear whether
geography, species barriers or other factors explain the difference, she says.

A rock-solid connection to PDD also remains provisional, without
confirmation that borna viruses can cause the disease in healthy
birds. "Right now we have a strong association, but we don't have
causal proof," she says. While Kistler's team solidifies their case,
veterinarians like Clubb are eager to put the research to use,
diagnosing the disease in parrots before they get sick. "That's a
tremendous breakthrough," she says. "We've been working on treatment
for years, and if we catch them early enough, most of them we can
return to normal."

Such a test could be critical for Spix's macaw, the only member of
the genus _Cyanopsitta_, she says. "This research could save a
species, a very special species." [ A photograph of a Spix's macaw

[This article is based on a publication by Kistler AL, Gancz A, Clubb
S, Skewes-Cox P, Fischer K, Sorber K, Chiu CY, Lublin A, Mechani S,
Farnoushi Y, Greninger A, Wen CC, Karlene SB, Ganem D, Derisi JL. in
Vvirology Journal 2008 Jul 31;5(1):88., entitled "Recovery of
divergent avian bornaviruses from cases of proventricular dilatation
disease: identification of a candidate etiologic agent".
(<http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/88>)

The authors' abstract reads: "BACKGROUND: Proventricular dilatation
disease (PDD) is a fatal disorder threatening domesticated and wild
psittacine birds worldwide. It is characterized by lymphoplasmocytic
infiltration of the ganglia of the central and peripheral nervous
system, leading to central nervous system disorders as well as
disordered enteric motility and associated wasting. For almost 40
years, a viral etiology for PDD has been suspected, but to date no
candidate etiologic agent has been reproducibly linked to the
disease. RESULTS: Analysis of 2 PDD case-control series collected
independently on different continents using a pan-viral microarray
revealed a bornavirus hybridization signature in 62.5 percent of the
PDD cases (5/8) and none of the controls (0/8). Ultra high throughput
sequencing was utilized to recover the complete viral genome sequence
from one of the virus-positive PDD cases. This revealed a
bornavirus-like genome organization for this agent with a high degree
of sequence divergence from all prior bornavirus isolates. We propose
the name avian bornavirus (ABV) for this agent. Further specific ABV
PCR analysis of an additional set of independently collected PDD
cases and controls yielded a significant difference in ABV detection
rate among PDD cases (71 percent, n=7) compared to controls (0
percent, n=14) (P=0.01; Fisher's Exact Test). Partial sequence
analysis of a total of 16 ABV isolates we have now recovered from
these and an additional set of cases reveals at least 5 distinct ABV
genetic subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: These studies clearly demonstrate the
existence of an avian reservoir of remarkably diverse bornaviruses
and provide a compelling candidate in the search for an etiologic
agent of PDD."

Previously ProMED-mail posted an offer of regents to further the
study of proventricular dilation disease (see reference below).
Thomas Briese and colleagues, also using the powerful technique of
high throughput sequencing, obtained evidence of a Borna-like agent
in the tissues of birds suffering proventricular dilation disease.
They have invited others to make use of the reagents they have
produced in search of other Borna-like viruses.

The virus family _Bornaviridae_ comprises a single genus _Borna
virus_ containing a single species _Borna disease virus_ (see:
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/ICTVdB/01.081.htm> for a
description of the genus). According to the ICTV (International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) Borna virus has a wide host range,
but its natural reservoir has not been determined. Despite its wide
host range and phenotypic variation, molecular epidemiological data
have revealed considerable sequence conservation. Uniquely among
negative stranded RNA viruses, replication and transcription take
place in the cell nucleus. Borna virus is probably distributed
worldwide. - Mod.CP
