Alberta dairy cow found with mad cow disease
--------------------------------------------
Canadian government officials have found a dairy cow in Alberta with
mad cow disease, but the finding is not surprising and shouldn't
affect beef exports, a spokesman for the Canadian Food Inspection
Agency (CFIA) said on Friday [4 Mar 2011]. The agency confirmed the
case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE as the disease is
also known, on 18 Feb 2011 in a 77-month-old dairy cow, spokesman Guy
Gravelle said.

In 2003, the 1st discovery of a cow in Canada with the disease led to
closures of numerous export markets to Canadian beef. Most have
reopened, other than South Korea and China, and importers are no
longer as sensitive to new cases as countries such as Canada now have
monitoring systems in place.

Canada continues to be rated a "controlled risk" for the disease by
the World Organization for Animal Health, Gravelle said. The newest
case may delay any upgrade to Canada's international risk status as a
country cannot apply for negligible status sooner than 11 years after
the latest-born case.

The cow has been destroyed and no part of its carcass entered the
human food or animal feed systems, Gravelle said.

The case, which is believed to be Canada's 18th, should not affect
exports of Canadian cattle or beef, he said, as a small number of BSE
cases are expected as Canada monitors for the disease.

[A 77-month-old cow is a about 6.5 years old. So a couple of
questions come to mind: Is this from a feed contamination issue? Or is
this agent really a prion? Could it be a virus?

These are intended as thought provoking questions. These questions
are not tossed out to receive answers as there are a host of research
papers, as well as opinions, but rather they are tossed out as
rhetorical questions. - Mod.TG]
