[New cases have occurred over the past few days in several states. Providing adequate surveillance and timely treatment over such a large geographic area is challenging. Fortunately, there is international help participating in treatment and surveillance. The maps and graphs in the above report are interesting and provide a good picture of how the outbreak has progressed over time. They can be accessed at the above URL.

The Ekiti State Government has uncovered fresh cases of Lassa fever, which has claimed 3 lives. The victims were a patient who tested positive to the disease, and 2 others who had contact with the deceased.

Commissioner for Health, Rotimi Ojo, who made this disclosure in Ado-Ekiti yesterday [Tue 13 Mar 2018], said 5 of the 8 other suspected cases in the state tested negative, one was uncertain and the last was pending as at press time. He, however, stressed that there was no cause for alarm, noting that the state government was taking proactive steps in surveillance activities that would involve all residents due to some recorded cases and deaths in neighbouring states.

He assured that the State Disease Control team had been activated, while the process of sensitising the people with jingles, adverts and other communication media were ongoing. Ojo said similar actions taken during the 2016 outbreak were successful, adding that the epidemic was perfectly controlled while the patient, who was properly managed, survived.

He disclosed that the isolation centre's at Ido Federal Teaching Hospital, Ido-Ekiti; Oba Adejuyigbe General Hospital and the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital, Ado-Ekiti were still operational. He urged health practitioners, teachers, traditional rulers, religious leaders, as well as community and opinion leaders to join hands with the state government to prevent a further spread of the disease in the state.

Meanwhile, the Cross River State government is set to commission a pharmaceutical company- CalaPharm that would manufacture drugs for the treatment of Lassa fever, meningitis and other diseases next month [April 2018].

The team, which was led by the Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mrs. Rosemary Achibong, also visited Rice City and Industrial Zone, which would house private companies under APZ.

Consultant in charge of the project, Farhan Khan, made this known yesterday [Tue 13 Mar 2018] in Calabar during inspection of projects undertaken by the present administration. He said the factory, which would be of World Health Organisation (WHO) standard would complement the Governor Ben Ayade Care and also focus on mother and childcare. Khan said: "Production is coming up soon, so we will be producing drugs of WHO standards and by next month, it should be commissioned because the machines are already here."

[Active participation of individual households is essential for prevention of Lassa fever virus infections. Preventing Lassa virus transmission requires getting local people to understand that virus spread to humans occurs when people are in contact with the reservoir rodent host, the multimammate mouse (in the genus _Mastomys_) or its excreta; and this can be difficult. Preventing this contact requires understanding that leads to action. This requires an extensive and continuous public education effort. Transmission of the virus also occurs in health facilities when personal protective equipment is not employed, and barrier-nursing practices are not adequate to protect staff from blood and secretions of infected patients. Although no vaccine is available, Ribavirin has been used to successfully treat patients and is most effective if patients are treated early in the course of infection.
