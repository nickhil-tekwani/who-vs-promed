Pertussis has recently claimed 2 lives in the San Francisco Bay area, a
situation that calls for increased vigilance among area pediatricians.
Pertussis tends to occur in cycles, particularly in communities resistant
to vaccinating their children.
According to state epidemiologist Cynthia O'Malley, there have been 198
cases of whooping cough in California this year, most of them in an arc
stretching from Santa Cruz to Sacramento. The increase is particularly
troubling in Santa Clara County, where 80 cases have been reported in the
first six months of this year, nearly four times the 23 cases in all of
last year.
On April 4, a 2-month-old boy died shortly after he was transferred to a
hospital from Kaiser Permanente's Santa Clara Medical Center. One month
later, a 2-month-old Contra Costa County girl succumbed to the
disease in an Oakland hospital. According to a spokeswoman for that
hospital, there have been 12 serious cases of whooping cough referred to
the hospital so far this year, compared with four cases last year.
Betsy McCarty, Santa Cruz County chief of public health, is particularly
concerned about the number of new cases in her communities. "We feel like
we're ground zero," she said. "We've had 38 cases so far this year,
compared to 42 in all of last year. That's of big concern to us." McCarty
said the county's health department has set up a command center to track
cases and to educate parents about just how dangerous whooping cough
can be. "This is one of the more lethal diseases for little babies," she
said. "Once you see a child under 1 year old with whooping cough, you
never forget it -- to see those little things gasping for breath."
_Bordetella pertussis_ [causes a mild to severe bronchial infection in
adults, but it can be deadly to children. Whooping cough begins as a chest
cold, accompanied by fever and a worsening cough. The bacteria destroy the
hairlike cilia, which line the bronchial tubes and sweep irritants out of
the lungs. The body's response is to cough convulsively. When a child
coughs out the last ounce of air from his or her lungs, and the lungs then
rapidly re-inflate, they emit the ghastly whoop that gives pertussis its
common name. Children who have it suffer terribly, and if they die, they
die of suffocation brought about by their own coughing and vomiting.
In rural areas of Sonoma County, where as many as half the schoolchildren
are unvaccinated at the insistence of their parents, two family-related
outbreaks helped boost whooping cough cases to 47 so far this year,
compared with 44 in all of 1997.
"We do have a recurring problem here with a community which is averse to
having their children vaccinated," said Dr. George Flores, Sonoma County
director of public health. "By their own choice, they are putting their
children at risk of acquiring and transmitting whooping cough to their
children or other people's children."
Private and public health plans make the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus
vaccine virtually universally available to California children.
Vaccinations are given at the age of 2, 4 and 6 months, followed by a
booster shot at 12 to 15 months.
Until a new and safer pertussis vaccine was placed on the market last year,
children ran a 1-in-1,750 risk of seizure after being vaccinated with the
DPT vaccine. Seizures -- surprisingly common with children -- are almost
invariably mild. But as many as 10 of every 1 million children vaccinated
suffer from swelling of the brain lining that can cause permanent brain
damage.
Mel Lippmann, disease control investigator for the San Francisco Department
of Public Health, said pertussis remains persistent in the population
because the effects of the vaccine wear off after about eight years. Older
children and adults are susceptible to whooping cough, and they often
contract it, but because their breathing passages are so much larger, they
pass it off as a bad cold. Adults, in fact, serve as a reservoir for the
bacteria.
Before the original pertussis vaccine was introduced in 1949, the incidence
of whooping cough was 150 cases per 100,000 Americans. The vaccine dropped
it to 1.5 cases per 100,000, but it has been creeping back up since 1983,
as more parents shun the vaccine for their children.
A Vienna, Va.-based organization of parents whose children suffered
reactions to vaccines, the National Vaccine Information Center, has been
active in publicizing adverse reactions to childhood immunizations. The
organization "supports the right of citizens to make educated, independent
vaccination decisions for themselves and their children," according to its
Internet Web site, and reports that more than 1 billion dollars has been
paid out to 1,000 victims since the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
was passed in 1986.
But Santa Cruz County public health chief McCarty said society is now
paying a price for the talk-show chat about the alleged dangers of
childhood vaccines. The risk of death from pertussis is 1 in every 200
cases. Even in a vaccinated population, the risk of whooping cough is
estimated to be 10 in 100,000. "The problem is that we have had such
success with childhood vaccination that people have forgotten what these
diseases are like," said McCarty. "People who think they are doing the
right thing are not getting their children vaccinated. They couldn't be
more mistaken. This is as important as putting your kid in the car seat,
seeing they have enough to eat and locking up the poisons."
