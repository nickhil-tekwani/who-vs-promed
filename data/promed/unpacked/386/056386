Myall Lakes dead fish toll grows
--------------------------------
Hundreds of dead fish continue to be found along sections of the Myall
Lakes shore. It comes a week after the mysterious death of thousands of
fish in the Port Stephens-Great Lakes Marine Park.

Commercial fisherman Neville Smith, who was involved in a survey around
Mungo Brush and Dees Corner on Tuesday [26 Aug 2008], estimated about half
a ton of dead fish was strewn along a kilometer (0.62 mi) of the shore.

"There were a lot of little fish, mostly bream [_Nemipteridae_], luderick
[_Girella tricuspidata_], and whiting [_Sillago bassensis_, _Sillago
flindersi_, and _Sillago robusta_]," he said. Many of the fish found last
week [week of 18 Aug 2008] had brown fungus growth around their mouths and
gills, possibly the result of a weakened immune system.

Mr Smith said he and other fishermen had stopped fishing in the Myall Lakes
due to concerns about the health of fish stocks. "I've moved down to Port
Stephens," he said. "It just means there are more blokes working in another
fishing area."

Recreational fisherman Andrew Sharp, who found hundreds of dead fish along
the Myall Lakes shore last week [week of 18 Aug 2008], said he suspected
some fish were also infected with red spot fungal disease. "I was fishing
at Corrie Island [on Mon 25 Aug 2008]," he said. "The bream had nasty
lesions which seemed to be different to the fungus that the fish in the
lake had on them."

Opinions among fishermen vary about what sparked last week's fish kill, but
they include acid sulphate run-off from road works and agricultural sewage
run-off.

Department of Primary Industry test results from dead fish collected from
the shore last week [week of 18 Aug 2008] are expected in coming days.

Great Lakes councillor Len Roberts has called for the creation of a single
management authority for the Myall River. No bans have been placed on
fishing in the Myall Lakes.

It is interesting that the affected fish are primarily fish used for human
consumption. This type of die-off must have occurred previously for the
authorities to not be putting fishing bans on the lake. Also of interest is
the concern of the fishermen that they are not willing to fish in that area.

We look forward to the results of the diagnostics around this issue. - Mod.TG
