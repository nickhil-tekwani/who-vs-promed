[1] 2nd case identified

A 2nd Ebola case has been confirmed in the latest outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), a city health official from the city of Beni [North Kivu] told Reuters.

The latest case involves a 42-year-old woman who tested positive yesterday [13 Oct 2021], according to Michel Tosalisana, the health official from Beni, where a cluster of cases was recently reported. They include a 2-year-old boy, whose fatal illness was confirmed, and 3 suspected cases -- the boy's neighbors -- who died earlier after experiencing similar symptoms.

Beni was one of the epicenters in a large outbreak in North Kivu province that occurred in 2018-2020. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that sporadic recurrent cases are expected, given Ebola persistence in some survivors and that animal species found in the DRC harbor the virus.

So far, it's not clear if the latest flare-up is linked to earlier human cases. North Kivu province experienced a smaller recurrence earlier this year [2021] that appeared to be linked to the large event, though the source of the outbreak was never found. Genetic sequencing is underway on samples from the boy who died, with results expected this week.

Yesterday [13 Oct 2021], health officials launched an Ebola vaccination campaign in Beni targeting the boy's contacts and the contacts of those contacts.

[It's not clear if this 2nd case was fatal. Contact tracing has begun, and it also is not clear if she is among the contacts of the 1st confirmed case.

1. #Ebola news: The new outbreak near Beni in the northeastern part of DRC is a flare up of the 2018-2020 North Kivu outbreak, genetic sequencing by Congo's
@inrb_kinshasa has confirmed, @SoceFallBirima told me. This outbreak is not a new spillover from nature.
3. The 1st flare up in North Kivu happened earlier this year [2021]. This new flare up is not linked to the [February 2021] cluster of cases, comparison of the sequences shows.
@SoceFallBirima says an investigation is underway to figure out how this flare up ignited & if there are more cases.
4. It is now well known that some people who have recovered from #Ebola can harbor virus in their bodies for long periods of time & can in rare instances transmit to others.

Steve Ahuka, a senior official at Congo's biomedical laboratory, told Reuters that preliminary sequencing indicated that the 1st confirmed case was the Zaire strain of the virus and was genetically linked to the 2018-2020 epidemic.

[Persistence of Ebola virus in immunologically protected areas of the body is a problem in controlling the spread of the virus. The study cited here went to 204 days, but apparently, the virus can persist longer. That is the most likely explanation, but alternatively, the virus is circulating at an undetectable rate.

Abstract
--------
"Background
Sexual transmission chains of Ebola virus (EBOV) have been verified and linked to EBOV RNA persistence in semen, post-recovery. The rate of semen persistence over time, including the average duration of persistence among Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors, is not well known. This cohort study aimed to analyze population estimates of EBOV RNA persistence rates in semen over time, and associated risk factors in a population of survivors from Sierra Leone."

Conclusions
"In this study, we observed that EBOV RNA persistence in semen was a frequent phenomenon, with high population rates over time. This finding will inform forthcoming updated recommendations on risk reduction strategies relating to sexual transmission of EBOV. Our findings support the implementation of a semen testing program as part of epidemic preparedness and response. Further, the results will enable planning of the magnitude of testing and targeted counseling needs over time."

"What did the researchers do and find?
- In this study, 220 men who had survived Ebola disease in Sierra Leone during 2015-2016 provided semen specimens, and all of those who had traces of Ebola virus detected were followed every other week until their specimen turned negative.
- 75 percent of these men still had traces of Ebola virus in their semen specimen at 6 months after being discharged following acute EVD, and 50% at 204 days.
- We also found that longer persistence of virus was significantly associated with severe acute EVD and older age."

[3] Call for frontline aid

As a new Ebola outbreak emerges in the DRC, the IRC calls for swift action and funding for frontline aid agencies to stop the spread

As Ebola is confirmed in North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) following the death of 4 people suspected with the virus in the last month [September 2021], the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is extremely concerned that another Ebola outbreak in the area will devastate a community still reeling from the last outbreak, fighting COVID-19 and seeing increasing violence and food insecurity. The last outbreak in this area was declared over just a few months ago in May [2021], whereas the last major outbreak lasting from 2018-2020 took the lives of more than 2200 people, almost 66% of those who presented with the virus. The response was extremely challenging due to ongoing conflict in the area, and the outbreak lasted more than 2 years. Beating Ebola in North Kivu now will be doubly complicated given the impacts of COVID-19. The IRC is calling for swift action and direct funding to frontline aid agencies to put an end to both outbreaks.

Kate Moger, Regional Vice President for the Great Lakes at the IRC, said, "Another outbreak in North Kivu could be disastrous if not quickly contained. People in this area have faced decades of violence by armed groups and have now, between Ebola and COVID-19, been faced with disease outbreaks for almost 3 straight years. These communities are still trying to rebuild from the impact the last Ebola outbreak had on their health systems, as well as the emotional trauma from an increase in violence, particularly against women -- all whilst fighting COVID-19. The COVID pandemic has further exacerbated an already dire situation and led to a major increase in food insecurity and even more conflict. Women and girls are always more adversely affected during crises and we must ensure the protection of women and girls throughout each of these multiple crises.

"It is imperative we apply the lessons learned from past outbreaks to stop the spread of Ebola in DRC and beyond its borders. The IRC stands in solidarity with the affected communities and is calling for immediate action and funding for frontline aid agencies to contain both outbreaks and prevent further spread."

There are now more people facing a severe hunger crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo than has ever been recorded in any country. DRC ranks in the IRC's emergency Watchlist top 5 for the 3rd year in a row, reflecting persistent volatility in a country that is now in its 4th decade of a major humanitarian crisis.

The IRC responded to the 201-2020 Ebola outbreak in North Kivu and Ituri working in more than 70 health facilities throughout Beni, Mabalako, Butembo, Goma, and Mombasa on infection prevention and control (IPC). The IRC is also working on women's and children's protection, and integrating Ebola-related protection concerns in areas where the IRC supports primary health care services. The IRC also worked to contain the 2014-2016 West Africa outbreak in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The IRC has been working in the DRC since 1996 providing emergency assistance and humanitarian aid to those affected by violence and uprooted from their homes. As the country struggles to recover from decades of conflict and widespread disease, the IRC is focusing our efforts in Tanganyika, Ituri, and North and South Kivu by providing emergency health care, shelter, water, sanitation, and emergency supplies to hundreds of thousands of people in eastern and central Congo.

[In addition to Ebola, there are many endemic diseases that are major health problems in the DRC including cholera, malaria, TB, measles, typhoid, dengue, polio, COVID. It's important for the country that this outbreak is brought under control as soon as possible through vaccination, contact tracing, and proper protective behavior, such as hand washing and safe burials. - Mod.LK]
