ANTHRAX, BOVINE - ISRAEL

On Mon 19 Nov 2007, 2 heifers out of a herd of 120 cows grazing on a
lot in the Lachish area died. The spleen of one of them was submitted
to the Dept. of Clinical Bacteriology and Mycology at the Kimron
Veterinary Institute, and _Bacillus anthracis_ was isolated from it.
The carcasses of both heifers were burnt and buried. An additional
heifer died on 20 Nov 2007, and again _B. anthracis_ was isolated
from its ear. Identification was made by morphological and biological
characteristics and PCR.

Since the Lachish region, located in the center-south of Israel, is
endemic for anthrax (see ProMED post 20040714.1893), the herd was
vaccinated (about 6 months ago). The last outbreak was in 2004, and a
single case was diagnosed in 2005 in the same herd. The herd
currently involved grazed in a different area on higher ground than
the one affected in 2004 and 2005, which had grazed in the riverbed.

Following the new cases, the herd was revaccinated on 21 Nov 2007 and
moved to another pasture. No further cases were observed by 25 Nov 2007.

[Our heartfelt thanks to Daniel for this prompt and valuable report.
The repeated outbreaks in this herd are a bit of a puzzler as was its
1st outbreak in 2004. It is worrying that vaccination does not appear
to be protecting this herd as well as it should. We have seen similar
late season outbreaks in Central Asia, but those involve trailing
cattle back from high summer grazing along traditional cattle trails.
One can speculate from a distance, but we must await the results of
the experts on the ground. - Mod.MHJ]
