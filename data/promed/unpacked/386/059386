By browsing through the literature, the EPPO Secretariat has
extracted the following new data concerning quarantine pests and
pests included on the EPPO Alert List. The situation of the pest
concerned is indicated in bold [in original], using the terms of ISPM no. 8.
Detailed records:
Huanglongbing - Florida
---------------------------
In Florida (US), as of June 2006, huanglongbing disease caused by
_Liberibacter asiaticum_ (EPPO A1 list) has been found in 12 counties
(Broward, Collier, De Soto, Hendry, Highlands, Lee, Martin,
Miami-Dade, Monroe, Palm Beach, Sarasota, St Lucie). The most
infected citrus are located in Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach,
Collier and Hendry counties. Infected trees have been found in 427
private properties (543 infected trees) and in 19 commercial orchards
(89 infected trees) (USDA-APHIS, 2006).
Sugarcane smut - Australia
--------------------------
Sugarcane smut caused by _Ustilago scitaminea_ was 1st detected in
Australia in 1997/1998 in the Ord river area, Western Australia (see
EPPO RS 98/146). The disease was largely controlled by replacing
susceptible cultivars with resistant ones. In June 2006, samples
showing symptoms of sugarcane smut were collected near Childers,
Queensland, and the presence of _U. scitaminea_ was subsequently
confirmed. Surveys are being made to delimit the extent of the
outbreak, and measures are taken to prevent any further spread
(ProMED-mail posting of 22 Jun 2006 [20060625.1772]).

[Updates on huanglongbing disease of citrus in Florida, USA and
sugarcane smut in Queensland, Australia are noted in this report,
which can be found in the 6 Jun 2006 issue of the EPPO reporting
service for 2006. The original source has been edited by deleting
host-pathogen combinations not covered by ProMED-mail (see link to
download the original file). These same disease outbreaks have been
the subject of several ProMED-mail postings in 2006, and further
details, maps and links can be found in the listings in the "See
also" section below. One of these [20060625.1772] is specifically
mentioned in the EPPO report. - Mod.JAD]
