Human coronavirus NL63: Association with Croup
-----------------------------------------------
A forthcoming paper in the international, open-access journal PLoS Medicine
makes the strongest association yet between a newly identified virus and
the pediatric respiratory disease commonly known as croup. [See: "Croup Is
Associated with the Novel Coronavirus NL63. By Lia van der Hoek 1*, Klaus

Following their recent description of the coronavirus HCoV-NL63, Lia van
der Hoek and colleagues suggest this is one of the most frequently detected
viruses in children with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). These
infections are estimated by the World Health Organization to be responsible
for one 5th of all deaths in children under 5 years old.
The team, including researchers from University Medical Centers in
Amsterdam, Bochum and Freiberg, determined the incidence of this novel
virus in a sample of children under 3 years old with such respiratory
infections. 949 samples of nasopharyngeal secretions were collected from
both hospitalized patients and outpatients in 4 different regions of
Germany. The study found that 49 samples (5.2 percent) were positive for
the virus HCoV-NL63 overall, with a greater incidence in outpatients (7.9
percent) than hospitalized patients (3.2 percent). Co-infection with 2
other viruses also known to be prominent in the cause of LRTIs was also
frequently observed.
The researchers also investigated the occurrence of HCoV-NL63 in cases of
respiratory disease in which no other virus could be detected. Here, a
strong relationship with the clinical symptoms associated with croup was
apparent: 43 percent of the HCoV-NL63-positive patients with high HCoV-NL63
load and absence of co-infection had croup, compared with 6 percent of
HCoV-NL63-negative patients. Previous studies have reported trends in
croup, such as the relative susceptibility of boys to the disease, its peak
occurrence in the 2nd year of life and its predominance in late autumn and
earlier winter, that are matched by patterns of HCoV-NL63 occurrence.
This systematic association of croup with HCoV-NL63 is particularly timely,
as the newly identified virus has spread worldwide, reported in Australia,
Japan, the US and Canada. The study will also contribute towards the
clarification of the viral causes of lower respiratory tract infections
generally; causes that have not always been apparent despite the frequency
of such infections among children.

[Respiratory tract infections are among the most frequent diseases in the
1st years of life. Although there are a large number of viruses that are
known to be involved in symptomatic respiratory tract infections, including
respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, and
human metapneumovirus, none of the known pathogens are detected in a
substantial number of cases. Recently, the authors identified a novel
coronavirus in a child with bronchiolitis, which they designated human
coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63). This virus, together with the SARS-CoV, an
unnamed and uncharacterized coronavirus identified by Allander et al., is
one of several new members of the family _Coronaviridae_ (The New Haven
coronavirus is generally considered to be an isolate of HCoV-NL63).
Croup is a common manifestation of lower respiratory tract infection in
children. The cause is generally assumed to be a respiratory virus, and,
frequently, parainfluenza virus type 1 has been implicated, but any of the
common respiratory infection viruses may be present. The authors data are
complex, and often there is evidence of co-infection with other common
respiratory tract viruses. Nonetheless, the authors come to the reasonable
conclusion that that HCoV-NL63 belongs to the group of most frequently
detected viruses in children under 3 years of age with lower respiratory
tract infections and that this virus is strongly associated with croup.
HCoV-NL63 infection (like most respiratory tract viruses affecting
children) is widespread in the global community, and HCoV-NL63 virus has
been found in different parts of the world, including Australia, Canada,
Japan, Belgium, and the United States. HCoV-NL63 is a human respiratory
virus that should be added to the list of pathogens that can cause numerous
lower respiratory tract infections in young children. - Mod.CP]
