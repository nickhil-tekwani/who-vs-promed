Cambodia: 3rd death may have been result of transmission from ducks
-----------------------------------------------
Cambodia's latest avian influenza death may have been caused by
contact with ducks carrying the deadly H5N1 virus, a World Health
Organization (WHO) official said on Mon 11 Apr 2005, as a public
awareness campaign geared up.
An 8-year-old girl from southwestern Kampot province died on Thursday
[7 Apr 2005] in a Phnom Penh hospital after being infected by the
virus. She was Cambodia's 3rd fatality since January 2005.
"We know she was in contact with chickens when they were dying in
February [2005], but the exposure period is too long," WHO official
Megge Miller said. "We're looking at the potential role of ducks as
asymptomatic carriers," she told the agency, noting that it was
common for ducks not to show signs of the disease but still carry and
spread the virus.
Miller said that 13 people who had been in contact with the victim --
both family members and hospital workers -- were being tested for the
virus, but none were suffering symptoms, and the results were
expected to be negative. She added that the girl's death was "not all
that surprising, given that we know there have been chicken deaths
around Kampot for the past few months and that we know that the virus
is in circulation. "It really emphasizes the need for a public
information campaign."
Cambodia's 1st 2 victims, a woman aged 25 who died in January 2005
after traveling to Viet Nam for treatment in January 2005, and a
28-year-old man who died last month [March 2005], were also from
Kampot province, which borders Viet Nam. 36 deaths have been reported
in Viet Nam since the end of 2003, while 12 have died in Thailand,
another neighbor of Cambodia.
Miller said that an awareness campaign was already under way in
Kampot, while a nationwide campaign was expected to begin in the next
week or 2. Meanwhile, a department of animal health official told the
agency that a team of animal health workers had been investigating
the case since last week [2nd week April 2005] and may cull all
poultry in a 5-km radius of the girl's village.

[The nature and extent of the girl's exposure to ducks is unclear,
but the absence of infection in her family and nursing staff
indicates that the infecting virus had no enhanced potential for
transmission from person-to-person. Nonetheless, the extent of avian
influenza A (H5N1) virus infection in ducks in Cambodia deserves
further study. - Mod.CP]
