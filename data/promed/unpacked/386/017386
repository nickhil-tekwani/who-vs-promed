There have been several previous reports showing interactions between HIV
and malaria in Africa.
Malaria and HIV have the best documented interaction in pregnant women.
Pregnant women who are HIV-1 infected develop more frequent and higher
density peripheral and placental parasitemias than do HIV-uninfected women
(2-4). One important consequence of this is that HIV-infected women have
been found to respond poorly to the standard regimen of antenatal
sufadoxine/pyrimethamine admininitration (2 doses) and may only respond if
it is administered monthly. The effect of HIV-1 on malaria parasitemia is
more pronounced in multigravidae than in primigravidae (3,4). In studies in
Mangochi and in Chikwawa (both in Malawi) the prevalence of placental
parasitemia in primigravidae at delivery was slightly decreased by HIV. In
both studies, in contrast, the prevalence of placental parasitemia was
twice as high in HIV-infected multigravidae as in HIV-negative multigravidae.
Malaria may also have an effect on HIV infections in nonpregnant adults.
Recently, a Malawian study has demonstrated that malaria-infected adults
have 7-fold higher HIV viral loads than malaria-free adults (1). Whether a
similar change in viral loads occurs in pregnant women (which could affect
mother-to-child transmission) remains to be seen.

[The increase in HIV viral load in malaria infected patients is likely to
be important for the rapid spread of HIV in tropical Africa, and as
suggested it may increase the mother-to-child transmission. It is
surprising that HIV infection reduce parasitemia in primigravidae, and one
wonder if it is really a true finding with a biological background.
Placental malaria is seen more often in primigravidae compared to
multigravidae and it would be expected that HIV-infection had the strongest
impact on primigravidae. - Mod. EP
