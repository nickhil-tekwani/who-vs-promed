To date, 175 cases of illness due to _E. coli_ O157:H7 infection have
been reported to the CDC, including 28 cases of hemolytic uremic
syndrome (HUS), 93 hospitalizations and one death.
FDA is working closely with CDC and the state of California. FDA has
determined that the spinach implicated in the outbreak was grown in 3
counties: Monterey, San Benito and Santa Clara in California. Spinach
grown in the rest of the United States has not been implicated in the
current _E. coli_ O157:H7 outbreak. The public can be confident that
spinach grown in the unimplicated areas can be consumed.
Consumers are advised not to purchase or consume fresh spinach if
they cannot verify that it was grown in areas other than the 3
California counties implicated in the outbreak.
Other produce grown in these counties is not implicated in this
outbreak. Processed spinach (e.g., frozen and canned spinach) is also
not implicated in this outbreak.
States Affected:
The 25 affected states are: Arizona (7), California (1), Colorado
(1), Connecticut (3) Idaho (4), Illinois (1), Indiana (9), Kentucky
(8), Maine (3), Maryland (3), Michigan (4), Minnesota (2), Nebraska
(9), Nevada (1), New Mexico (5), New York (11), Ohio (20), Oregon
(6), Pennsylvania (8), Tennessee (1), Utah (18), Virginia (2),
Washington (3), Wisconsin (44), and Wyoming (1).
Laboratory Findings:
The Utah Department of Health (UDOH) and the Salt Lake Valley Health
Department (SLVHD) have confirmed that _E. coli_ O157:H7, the same
strain as that associated with the outbreak, has been found in a bag
of Dole baby spinach purchased in Utah with a use-by date of 30 Aug
2006. Laboratory tests were conducted by the Utah Public Health
Laboratory (UPHL).
The New Mexico Department of Health announced on 20 Sep 2006 that it
had linked a sample from a package of spinach with the outbreak
strain of _E. coli_ O157:H7. The spinach was eaten by one of New
Mexico's patients before becoming sick. DNA fingerprinting tests
determined that the strain from the spinach matches the strain from
patients in the outbreak. The package of spinach that tested positive
was "Dole Baby Spinach, Best if Used by 30 Aug."

A bag of Dole-brand baby spinach bought in western Pennsylvania is
the 3rd in the nation being tied to a deadly _E. coli_ [O157:H7] outbreak.
Pennsylvania health officials said today a state lab identified the
strain of _E. coli_ in a sample of spinach purchased around 8 Sep
2006. Health officials in California said yesterday that 2 other
bags of Dole baby spinach were helping them zero in on the source of
the outbreak that has sickened 175.
The 2 bags were packaged at the same plant, on the same shift and the
same day. One bag was found in Utah and the other in New
Mexico. The plant is owned by Natural Selection Foods of San Juan
Bautista. The company supplies Dole and more than 20 other brands.

Dr. Eric E. Whitaker, state public health director, announced today a
sample of bagged spinach collected from Illinois' 1st case of _E.
coli_ O157:H7 was positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7. Last week an
elderly woman from LaSalle County was the 1st state resident whose
_E. coli_ O157:H7 isolate matched the national outbreak strain
associated with spinach consumption. Bagged spinach collected from
the home of Illinois' 1st case has been tested at the Illinois
Department of Public Health new Springfield Combined Laboratory
Addition and found to be positive for _E. coli_ O157:H7. Further
testing will take place to confirm that the strain of _E. coli_
isolated from this bagged spinach also matches the outbreak strain.

[...and a 4th. It is not specifically stated that these spinach
isolates have yet been typed as outbreak strains or whether they were
-- as the 1st 2 bags -- produced in the same factory, on the same
day, and on the same shift. - Mod.LL]

A 2nd tainted bag of spinach found in Utah over the weekend has
helped health officials pinpoint _E. coli_ contamination in one
specific batch of fresh spinach in a California processing plant.
The Associated Press reported Tuesday that California health
officials said the Utah bag of Dole baby spinach and another of the
same brand found in New Mexico last week were both processed during
the same shift on 15 Aug 2006 at Natural Selection Foods' San Juan
Bautista plant in the Salinas Valley.
"We are looking very aggressively at what was produced on that date,"
Dr. Kevin Reilly, deputy director of prevention services for the
California Department of Health Services, said late Monday. "Much of
the feedback we got from patients right now was related to Dole packaging."
The outbreak has prompted federal officials to consider tighter
regulation of the growing and processing of fresh spinach. Some
consumer groups and agriculture experts have been critical of the
regulatory process, citing what they called lax oversight of the
agriculture industry.
On Tue, 26 Sep 2006, 3 top national environmental organizations --
the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), the Sierra Club and the
Environmental Integrity Project -- warned that bacterial pollution
from livestock and poultry factory farms poses a major threat to
public health. They were to meet with U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency officials to urge strengthened regulations for farm pollution,
according to a statement issued by the 3 groups.
