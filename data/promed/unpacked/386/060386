Viet Nam: deaths of 10-year old girl and Cambodian woman; new suspected cases
-----------------------------------------------
Avian influenza has killed a 10-year-old girl in southern Viet Nam,
doctors say, and they hope the death of a Cambodian women suspected
of having the virus would force Phnom Penh to take preventative
measures.
Death of 10-year-old Vietnamese girl (12th fatality this year)
-----------------------------------------------
The girl from the southern Vietnamese province of Long An died on Sun
30 Jan 2005, said a doctor at Ho Chi Minh City's Pediatric Hospital
No. 1, raising the toll in Viet Nam from the H5N1 virus to 12, since
the disease erupted again in December 2004. The Asian avian influenza
virus has killed 44 people since the end of 2003, 32 in Viet Nam and
12 in Thailand.
Death of suspected case from Cambodia
-----------------------------------------------
Vietnamese doctors expect test results on Tuesday [1 Feb 2005] on a
25-year-old Cambodian woman who was hospitalized on 28 Jan 2005 with
a high fever and who died on Sunday [30 Jan 2005]. Her lungs had been
badly damaged. "This case is a worry, as her brother had died from
respiratory failure before he could be rushed to a hospital," said
doctor Nguyen Van Hung, who supervised the Cambodian patient, quoting
details given by relatives of the woman. If the case is confirmed,
the woman would be the 1st person from Cambodia found to be infected
and killed by the H5N1 avian influenza virus. Poultry outbreaks were
last detected in Cambodia in September 2004, but no human casualty
has been reported there.
"We hope the test results will soon be in place so as to caution the
health authorities in Cambodia, as people there have been coming over
to Ha Tien town very often," Hung said. The Vietnamese town of Ha
Tien borders Cambodia in the southern province of Kien Giang. The
town is 340 km (210 miles) southwest of Ho Chi Minh City. "We are
still waiting for the test result to be passed from Viet Nam. It is
still a suspected case for us," said Ly Sovann, head of Cambodia's
Centre for Disease Control.
High fever, coughing and acute pneumonia are symptoms of avian
influenza, which kills about 80 percent of people it infects. The
World Health Organization has said the avian influenza virus might
already have infected people in countries neighboring Viet Nam, such
as Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar, that lack the infrastructure or
capacity to conduct surveillance.
Vietnamese and Thai cooperation
--------------------------------------
In Thailand, outbreaks among chickens have been confirmed in 5
provinces in eastern and central parts of the country, the latest on
28 Jan 2005 in Nakhon Pathom, the livestock department said on Monday
[31 Jan 2005]. Thailand, worried that the disease will spread from
Viet Nam, has offered to help Hanoi contain its outbreaks. Vietnamese
and Thai scientists will meet next month [February 2005] to share
information on battling the virus, Nguyen Tran Hien, director of Viet
Nam's National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology, told Reuters.
Additional suspected cases in Viet Nam
---------------------------------------------
Hien's facility is testing 7 Vietnamese admitted to a Hanoi hospital
over the weekend on suspicion of having avian influenza. The tests
have proved negative so far, he said. Researchers in Ho Chi Minh City
were also testing samples from a 39-year-old man who died on Sunday
[30 Jan 2005] in the central city of Danang, said the Saigon Giai
Phong daily. If confirmed, he would the 1st casualty of the virus in
central Viet Nam.
