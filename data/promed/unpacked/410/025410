Early in 2009, the Miami-Dade County Health Department (MDCHD), Office of
Epidemiology, Disease Control and Immunization Services (EDCIS)
investigated several sporadic cases of meningococcal disease and noted an
unusually high number of cases [of infection] with _Neisseria meningitidis_
of the W135 serogroup. A [pulse field gel electrophoresis] PFGE analysis
conducted by the Department of Health State Lab on all meningococcal
isolates of W135 serogroup reported from 2007 to present identified
matching PFGE patterns in 9 sporadic cases from Miami-Dade (all reported
during the last 6 months), 2 cases from Broward, 1 case from West Palm
Beach, and 1 case from England (a Miami-Dade visitor). The laboratory
analysis also identified 4 other cases of serogroup W135 inefction with
unrelated PFGE patterns reported in 2007 and 2008 in central and northern
Florida.

Summary characteristics of the 13 South Florida cases include:
- 8 of 13 (61.5 per cent) patients were female;
- 7 of 13 (53.8 per cent) were white Hispanic, 4 of 13 (30.7 per cent)
black non-Hispanic; and 2 (15.4 per cent) white non-Hispanic.
- age distribution: 1 infant, 3 cases aged 20-30 years old, 3 cases 50-70
years old; and 4 were over 70 years old.
- 4 (30.7 per cent) patients died; 2 were 20-30 years old, and 2 were older
than 50 years old.
- only 2 cases had signs and symptoms of meningitis; all other cases had
positive blood cultures without prominent signs of meningitis. This
presentation is similar to a study where patients with serogroup W135 were
more likely to have pure bacteremia without meningitis. (Source: BMC
Infectious Diseases 2006, 6:7 doi: 10.1186/1471-2334-6-7
<http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/6/7>)
- symptom frequencies for the 13 cases were: fever/chills 54 per cent,
headache 54 per cent, photophobia 38 per cent, stiff neck 38 per cent,
confusion 38 per cent, drowsiness 31 per cent, nausea 8 per cent, and
vomiting 8 per cent.

Based on information from case interviews, no further associations were
established among these 13 individuals or the British tourist, who became
ill while visiting Miami.

In the United States and Florida, the most common _N. meningitidis_
serogroups are B, C, and Y. Serogroup W135 represents about 3 per cent of
invasive isolates nationally and is generally considered to have low
potential to cause invasive disease or outbreaks. However, in 2000, a large
multi-country outbreak of more than 400 cases of serogroup W135 occurred
among religious pilgrims to Saudi Arabia.

Many serogroup W135 meningococcal disease cases in the United States are
associated with recent foreign travel; none of the latest 13 cases reported
among US residents in South Florida had travel history. [It should be
noted, though, that one of the 13 cases was a Miami-Dade visitor from
England]. Only 2 of the 67 meningococcal disease cases reported in Florida
during 2007 were serogroup W135.

This is an ongoing cluster investigation, therefore we request your
assistance; please send the specimens of suspect meningococcal disease
cases to the State Laboratory, Miami Branch for confirmation, serogrouping,
and further PFGE study.

The outbreak of the W135 form of meningitis that has killed 4 people in
South Florida is a "unique situation," an expert at the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Thursday morning [23 Apr
2009]. "We've never had a transmission like this in the United States,"
said Amanda Cohn, a physician who specializes in studying meningitis.

CDC has seen individual cases in the United States of the deadly,
fast-moving strain, and there have been outbreaks in other parts of the
world, including one that hit Muslims on the pilgrimage to Mecca and in the
African country of Burkina Faso, Cohn said. But the CDC has never seen a
case in which 4 people have died and 8 others made ill during a 6-month
period in one area, as has happened in South Florida.

They're particularly puzzled because there are no obvious connections
between the patients. "This is very interesting," said Cohn, an
Atlanta-based researcher. "We don't know what's happening." The strain can
kill within hours, and anyone experiencing severe headache, fever, nausea,
vomiting and stiff neck should see a doctor immediately, health officials
warned. It's a very scary disease," when someone gets it, said Cohn, but
"people don't need to be scared. ... It's not incredibly infectious. You're
not going to see hundreds and hundreds of cases."

W135 is one of the strains covered by the meningitis vaccine, but Cohn said
she saw no need for the general population to rush to get a shot. If there
are certain subgroups that are at high risk and need to be vaccinated, the
local health departments would make that announcement.

Many people may carry one of 13 strains of meningitis within them but not
get sick. "We don't understand why some people develop the disease," Cohn
said. People with colds or the flu might be more susceptible, but the
connections are still unclear. 15 or 20 percent of those who get the W135
strain will die, Cohn said. "That's high. This is a very serious disease."

Miami-Dade health officials revealed the W135 problem at a hastily called
news conference Wednesday [22 Apr 2009]. They said the strain could be
curable with antibiotics -- but only if patients seek treatment quickly.

[The following is extracted from Mod.ML's comments in ProMED-mail post
archive number 20090218.0674:

Each year, up to 3000 people in the USA develop meningococcal disease. The
annual incidence generally ranges from 0.5 to 1.1 cases per 100 000. The
incidence peaks in late winter and early spring. Most cases are sporadic;
less than 2 per cent occur in outbreaks
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm> [updated at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5631a3.htm>]. Outbreaks tend to
occur in semi-closed communities, such military recruit camps, college
dormitories, schools, and day-care centers. Community-based outbreaks in
towns, cities, and counties may also occur among persons who are not close
contacts of each other and who do not share a common affiliation.

Although the incidence of meningococcal disease in general is highest in
children less than 2 years of age
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr5407a1.htm> [updated at:
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5631a3.htm>, more cases arise
among the 5 to 19 year old group during epidemics than during non-epidemic
periods. Currently, serogroups B, C and Y cause the majority of infections
in the USA; serogroup A is rare in the USA, and W135 causes a very small
proportion of infections; serogroup B is the most common serogroup in
infants, while serogroup Y causes the majority of cases in those aged 65
years and older
<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/meningitis/FINALChanging_Epidemiology_of_Meningococcal_Disease.pdf>.

An outbreak of meningococcal disease is defined as the occurrence of 3 or
more confirmed or probable cases during a period of less than or equal to 3
months, resulting in a primary disease attack rate of at least 10 cases per
100 000 persons, which is about 10 times greater than the normal occurrence
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>.

Chemoprophylaxis is given to appropriate contacts whose risk for acquiring
meningococcal disease is 500-800 times greater than among the total
population <http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>. Close
contacts of patients are household members, day-care center contacts, and
persons directly exposed to the patient's oral secretions. Administering
chemoprophylaxis to persons who are not close contacts of patients usually
is not recommended. Neither oropharyngeal nor nasopharyngeal cultures for
_N. meningitidis_ are useful in deciding who should receive chemoprophylaxis.

In an outbreak, the population at risk should be vaccinated with the
meningococcal vaccine appropriate for the serogroup causing the outbreak as
soon as possible after an outbreak has been declared
<http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00046237.htm>. Mass immunization
campaigns are labor-intensive and costly. Meningococcal polysaccharide
vaccines do not protect very young children, do not protect unvaccinated
population groups, and only provide protection for up to 3 years. As a
result, repetitive meningitis outbreak responses can deplete a country's
scarce health care finances with comparably little impact. A preventive
strategy based on conjugate vaccines could have a significantly larger and
more enduring impact.

A quadrivalent A, C, Y and W135 conjugate vaccine was licensed in the
United States in January 2005. The meningococcal conjugate vaccines induce
a T-cell-dependent response, resulting in an improved immune response in
infants, providing long-lasting immunity and preventing nasopharyngeal
carriage of _N. meningitidis_ and thus reducing bacterial transmission of
this microorganism
<http://www.nfid.org/pdf/publications/meningococcalepid.pdf>. CDC in any
case now recommends the meningococcal conjugate vaccination for college
students and any persons aged 11 to 18 years, military recruits,
microbiologists who are routinely exposed to isolates of _N. meningitidis_,
persons who travel to Mecca during the annual Haj or to countries in which
_N. meningitidis_ is hyperendemic or epidemic, particularly if contact with
the local population will be prolonged, persons who have terminal
complement component deficiencies, and persons who have anatomic or
functional asplenia <http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/559807>

The populations for Miami-Dade and Broward counties are about 2.4 and 1.8
million, respectively, and for the city of West Palm Beach about 100 000
(<http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/12/1276600.html>). The state of
