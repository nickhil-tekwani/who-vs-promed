Cote D'Ivoire, Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (2006-)
-------------------------------------------------------
General information
Report type: immediate notification
Started: 16 Jul 2022
Confirmed: 21 Jul 2022
Reported: 20 Oct 2022
Event status: resolved
Reason for notification: 1st occurrence in the country
Causal agent: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus
Nature of diagnosis: clinical, laboratory
This event pertains to the whole country.

Outbreak location 1: Abidjan commune de Abobo Akeikoi Djibi, Abidjan
Date of start of the outbreak: 16 Jul 2022
Epidemiological unit: farm
Affected animals
Species / Susceptible / Cases / Deaths / Killed and disposed of / Slaughtered or killed for commercial use / Vaccinated
Cattle / 169 / 6 / 2 / 0 / 0 / 0

Affected population: 2 oxen from a neighboring country having gone through the slaughterhouse at Port-Bouët were introduced into the herd where they stayed for 2 weeks before showing signs of depression and anorexia. The ox concerned died 5 days before Tabaski day [9 Jul 2022] and the 2nd ox three days after it. The farm that housed the 2 oxen is on a nearby premises with 3 livestock enclosures.

Epidemiology
Source of the outbreak(s) or origin of infection: vectors, introduction of new live animals, animal in transit

Epidemiological comments: Routine screening on [3 and 4 Aug 2022] in the 3 livestock enclosures where 2 oxen from a neighboring country stayed before showing signs of depression and anorexia; one of them was left to the population for consumption and would have caused hemorrhagic fever. In total, blood samples (serum and plasma) from 167 cattle were collected and 1183 ticks were collected in the Abidjan area, commune of Abobo, in Abobo Akeikoi Djibi. RT-PCR in blood samples yielded the following results: 6 positive samples (for Crimea-Congo virus RNA) and 161 negative samples. The detection of Crimea-Congo virus by RT-PCR in ticks started Thursday [11 Aug 2022]. On Friday [22 Jul 2022], the Infectious Disease Department submitted to Pasteur Institute a dried blood sample for suspected hemorrhagic fever in a patient (32 years old) who had consumed meat from a dead ox. On Saturday [23 Jul 2022], the laboratory performed RT-PCR and serology testing for the following viruses: Arboviruses: yellow fever, dengue, Rift Valley, West Nile, Chikungunya; Hemorrhagic fever viruses: Ebola, Lassa, Crimea-Congo. Results: RT-PCR was positive for Crimea-Congo virus. Serology: presence of IgM immunoglobulins against Crimea-Congo virus. Control measures have been applied and no mortality has been reported to date.

Control measures at event level
Domestic control measures applied: Surveillance within the restricted zone, surveillance outside the restricted zone, movement control, quarantine, control of vectors, disinfestation, disinfection, screening

Diagnostic test results
Laboratory name and type / Species / Test / First and last result date / Result
Institute Pasteur de Côte d'Ivoire (IPCI) / Cattle / Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) / 21 Jul 2021 / positive

["Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) of the genus _Orthonairovirus_ of the family Nairoviridae causes a zoonotic disease in many countries of Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and south-eastern Europe. As the distribution of CCHFV coincides with the distribution of its main vector, ticks of the genus _Hyalomma_, the spread of infected ticks into new, unaffected areas facilitates the spread of the virus. The virus circulates in a tick-vertebrate-tick cycle but can also be transmitted horizontally and vertically within the tick population. _Hyalomma_ ticks infest a wide spectrum of different wildlife species (e.g., deer and hares) and free-ranging livestock animals (e.g., goat, cattle, and sheep). Many birds are resistant to infection, but ostriches appear to be more susceptible. Viraemia in livestock is short-lived and of low intensity. These animals play a crucial role in the life cycle of ticks and in the transmission and amplification of the virus and are, therefore, in the focus of veterinary public health. As animals do not develop clinical signs, CCHFV infections have no effect on the economic burden regarding livestock animal production. In contrast to animals, infections of humans can result in the development of a severe disease, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF).

"Every year, more than 1000 human CCHF cases are reported from Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, and Turkey. In other countries, infection rates and case numbers are largely unknown. Case fatality rates of 5% (in Turkey) to 80% have been reported and may depend on the virus strain, education of the local population, and the effectiveness of public health interventions. At present, the pathogenesis of the disease in humans is not well understood. Most people become infected by tick bites and by crushing infected ticks, but infection is also possible through contact with blood and other body fluids of viraemic animals. As CCHFV also has the potential to be transmitted directly from human-to-human, nosocomial outbreaks might occur.

"There is no approved CCHF vaccine available, and therapy is restricted to treatment of the symptoms. Health education and information on prevention and behavioral measures are most important in order to enhance public risk perception and, therefore, decrease the probability of infections. Thus, the identification of endemic areas is crucial for focused and targeted implementation of public health measures. Serological screening of ruminants allows CCHFV- affected areas to be identified, as antibody prevalence in animals is a good indicator of local virus circulation. Treatment with tick repellents can be quite effective in reducing the tick infestation of animals. To protect laboratory staff, handling of CCHFV infectious materials should only be carried out at an appropriate biocontainment level."
