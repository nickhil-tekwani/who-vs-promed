HEMORRHAGIC FEVER WITH RENAL SYNDROME - RUSSIA (05): (TATARSTAN, UDMURTIA)

Tatarstan and the neighbouring regions like Samara, Bashkortostan and
Udmurtia are well known endemic hotspots for hemorrhagic fever with
renal syndrome (HFRS) due to Puumala hantavirus carried by the bank
vole _Myodes glareolus_ (earlier called _Clethrionomys glareolus_).
The long-term studies since the early 1970's by Alla Bernshtein
(Chumakov Institute, Moscow) and her colleagues (2004) in Udmurtia, a
northern neighbour of Tatarstan, indicate clearly that bank voles
undergo 3-4 year population fluctuations in this region, and human
HFRS incidence understandably depends on these bank vole peaks. Human
trash in forests is not associated with fluctuations of the vole
population.

On the other hand, as pointed out by Professor Tkachenko (Moscow),
the political change from the Soviet Union to present-day Russia
allowed for much more private construction of houses and cabins in
forest areas, increasing the contact between humans and forest
rodents, partly explaining the increasing trend of HFRS in European
Russia (Tkachenko et al. 1999).

Also, according to data by Bernshtein et al, superimposed on the 3-4
year fluctuations, there is an increasing trend in the abundance of
bank voles in Udmurtia. This may be related to climate, either
changes in snow cover, as suggested Bernshtein et al., and/or
increasing summer temperatures promoting masting [the fruiting of
forest trees] and, consequently, providing increased food resources
for rodents, as suggested for western temperate Europe very recently
by Tersago et al. (2008).

[ProMED-mail is indebted to Professor Henttonen for provision of some
of the detail missing from previous reports of HFRS from this region.
It is interesting to learn that greater access to forest regions as a
result of the dissolution of the Soviet Union may be playing a role
in increasing the prevalence of HFRS in the new Republics in addition
to the more predictable roles of rodent population fluctuations and
climate change.
