A Georgetown man is the 3rd person to die of eastern equine encephalitis [EEE virus infection] in Massachusetts this year [2012], officials confirmed Wednesday [3 Oct 2012].

Georgetown town manager Michael Farrell says the 76-year-old man died 27 Sep 2012. The case has not been confirmed by state health officials.

The family of a 63-year-old Amesbury resident said she died in September [2012] as a result of complications from EEE. Officials have said a Worcester County man in his 70s also died earlier this year.

State public health officials have reported 7 human cases of EEE in Massachusetts so far this year, as well as 20 cases of West Nile Virus.

[Apparently, this is the man who was reported ill on 18 Sep 2012 (see ProMED-mail archive no 20120919.1300673), and has now died. Although EEE virus infections are relatively uncommon they can be serious, leading to death, as in the cases above, or neurological damage in survivors. With autumn temperatures beginning to fall, hard frosts should be coming soon ending the EEE virus transmission season.
