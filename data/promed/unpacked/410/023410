The number of people killed by cholera in Malawi has risen to 7, the Ministry of Health says. According to Ministry of Health and Population, this follows the death of one person in Lilongwe. Providing an update on the cholera situation, the ministry's spokesperson Joshua Malango said 9 new cholera cases were also reported on [Wed 14 Feb 2018].

"On [Wed 14 Feb 2018], 9 new cases were reported from 2 districts: 5 in Lilongwe and 4 in Karonga," he said. According to Malango, 17 cholera patients are still admitted at treatment centres in Lilongwe and Kasungu.

Since October 2017, 478 cases have been reported in 13 affected districts with 7 deaths. To curb the disease, government has been sensitizing communities on sanitation and has also started administering cholera vaccine.

UNICEF has also been using drones to map out cholera cases in Malawi's capital, Lilongwe. According to UNICEF, the drones take images of high density areas showing latrines and water points and maps out potential problem areas.

[2] Cholera - Zambia (Central Province, Lusaka)

A total of 4 people have died from suspected cholera in fishing camps located in Shibuyunji of Central Province leading to the Ministry of Health to shutting down 7 illegal fishing camps. The district has so far recorded 10 cases of cholera.

Health Minister Chitalu Chilufya who conducted an on-the-spot check at some of the fishing camps said the death of 4 people at Chiyasa fishing camp was unacceptable. Dr Chilufya was accompanied on the visit by minister in the Vice-President's Office Sylvia Chalikosa, ministry of Livestock and Fisheries Permanent Secretary David Shamulenge, Health Permanent Secretary Kennedy Malama and Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit National Coordinator Yande Musonda.

Dr Chilufya said it was sad that people could be living in a place that had no water and the necessary sanitary facilities for human habitation. He said it was unacceptable that at a time the Government was fighting cholera, people in other areas were still adamantly living in conditions that promoted the disease. The camps were found at the time of the visit.

"All the fishing camps we have visited have no clean drinking water and sanitation services," Dr Chilufya said. He said the Government was working to ensure that cholera was eliminated and had provided a center in Shibuyunji to vaccinate the people against cholera in the fishing area.

While giving a cholera update at Mutima Fishing Camp in Shibuyunji, Dr Chilufya said that 16 new cholera cases had been recorded in Lusaka in 24 hours on [Tue 13 Feb 2018]. He said despite the heavy downpour experienced in Lusaka, there had been no spike in the cases of cholera as the trend has continued to go down every week.

"From [Wed 7 Feb 2018], Shibuyunji has contributed to the cumulative number of cholera cases of 33 in which 4 deaths have been recorded in the illegal fishing camps," Dr Chilufya said.

In Nierteti in Central Darfur, the death toll from acute watery diarrhea, suspected of being cholera, has amounted to 9, while the infection cases have risen to more than 100.

Yesterday, [Tue 13 Feb 2018], activists in voluntary work reported to Radio Dabanga from Nierteti that 4 people died of the disease while being transported from neighboring villages to the hospital. Up to 5 more deaths were reported from Nierteti the previous day [Mon 12 Feb 2018]. An activist from the hospital told Radio Dabanga that the medical isolation center allocated to receive the cases was full, while others are still searching for a place. He said that the isolation center has about 65 suspected cases of cholera.

A total of 2 people died from similar symptoms of acute watery diarrhea or cholera in the last week [week of Sun 4 Feb 2018]. Nierteti Hospital's designated isolation ward received a number of patients during the weekend, volunteers in the hospital told Radio Dabanga. 15 cases of cholera or diarrhea arrived from the villages of Ketzuela, Kurna, Mara and Kutrem, bringing the total number of cases in the hospital to 53 on [Mon 12 Feb 2018].

September 2017 was the last time that Nierteti Hospital was treating more than 10 cases of cholera - most of them arrived from the camps for displaced people - at a time when the spread of the epidemic in Sudan seemed to subside. A slight increase in cases was reported during the last week of 2017 and the 1st week of 2018, however: 46 and 30 new cases respectively were registered in eastern Sudan.

A total of 4 cases of cholera have been reported in Katilu, Turkana South, raising concerns about an outbreak. Health and Sanitation executive Jane Ajele said the 4 residents of Lopur village were admitted at Katilu Hospital. "They are in stable condition. They are taking fluids in isolation," she told reporters at her Lodwar office on [Tue 13 Feb 2018]. A team of 1st responders was sent to the area to prevent an outbreak.

"We are setting up a cholera treatment center at Katilu Hospital and also distributing emergency kits and aquatabs for water treatment," Ajele said. She noted the Health ministry has been on high alert since January 2018 when cases were confirmed and those infected treated.

Health and Sanitation Chief Officer Moses Natome said the department will educate residents on the disease and increase surveillance to prevent large scale infections.

[5] Cholera - Mozambique (Nampula Province)

The cholera outbreak in the northern Mozambican province of Nampula has now spread to the Lurio administrative post in Memba district. The provincial chief doctor, Sulaimana Isidoro, told AIM on [Tue 6 Feb 2018], that the 1st cases of cholera in Lurio were diagnosed on [Tue 30 Jan 2018]. So far 22 people in Lurio are known to have caught the disease, one of whom has died.

Isidoro said that, since the outbreak began in September 2017, there have been 1552 cases diagnosed and 2 deaths. The 1st cases were in and around Memba town. Lurio is in the north of Memba district, just south of the Lurio river, which forms the boudary with Cabo Delgado province. "We have opened a treatment centre in Lurio, where the cases I mentioned are cared for", said Isidoro.

"The centre in Nampula city remains open, and is receiving patients sporadically. In the last 24 hours only one patient entered the Nampula centre." She was pleased that the campaigns promoting individual and collective hygiene in the city seemed to have paid off, bringing the cholera situation in the city under control. Nampula also suffered serious damage from a tropical depression that struck the province in January 2018. Some 3300 people needed temporary shelter after the storms damaged or destroyed their homes in Mossuril, Monapo and Mozambique Island districts. The provincial governor, Victor Borges, on [Tue 6 Feb 2018] visited the Nampula branch of the government's relief agency, the National Disaster Management Institute (INGC), where he was told that the 2 accommodation centres set up for the storm victims have now been closed.

Deputy Commissioner M Lokesh said 4 residents of Maidolalu village in Bhadravathi taluk died of cholera. Speaking to reporters here on [Wed 7 Feb 2018], he said stool and water samples sent to district laboratory had confirmed the outbreak of cholera in the village. Consumption of contaminated water is the cause of cholera. Water supply through existing pipeline is stopped and a new pipeline will be soon installed. Treated water is being supplied to the village through tankers, he said.

Lokesh said residents complained of gastroenteritis on [Sun 11 Feb 2018] at Maidolalu village and were admitted to McGann and a private hospital. Out of 54 cases reported, 4 adults died of cholera. He said a training camp for home guard aspirants was held in the village between [Mon 29 Jan and Thu 8 Feb 2018]. Due to the lack of adequate toilets, the home guards opted for open defecation. This might have led to water contamination.

The deputy commissioner said he had not received any letter from the National Human Rights Commission seeking a report on the incident.

[7] Diarrhea - Micronesia (Yap)

The Department of Health Services is informing the public that its syndromic surveillance system shows that Yap has exceeded the threshold for diarrhea cases. Diarrhea can be caused by parasites such as amoeba or giardia, bacteria in food poisoning or contamination of water by viruses spread through unsanitary conditions.

Frequent and proper hand-washing is the best way to reduce the chance of spreading infections. Most of these infections are transmitted primarily through the fecal-oral route, either by consumption of feces-contaminated food or water, or by direct person-to-person spread.

[The etiology of the gastroenteritis cases here is not stated.

Yap traditionally refers to an island located in the Caroline Islands of the western Pacific Ocean, a part of the Federated States of Micronesia. The name "Yap" in recent years has come to also refer to the state within the Federated States of Micronesia, inclusive of the Yap Main Islands and its various outer islands. The area can be found on a map at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yap. - Mod.LL]


[The mortality from cholera and most diarrheal illnesses is related to non-replacement of fluid and electrolytes from the diarrheal illness.

As stated in Lutwick LI, Preis J, Choi P: Cholera. In: Chronic illness and disability: the pediatric gastrointestinal tract. Greydanus DE, Atay O, Merrick J (eds). NY: Nova Bioscience, 2017 (in press), oral rehydration therapy can be life-saving in outbreaks of cholera and other forms of diarrhea:

"As reviewed by Richard Guerrant et al (1), it was in 1831 that cholera treatment could be accomplished by intravenous replacement, and, although this therapy could produce dramatic improvements, not until 1960 was it 1st recognized that there was no true destruction of the intestinal mucosa, and gastrointestinal rehydration therapy could be effective, and the therapy could dramatically reduce the intravenous needs for rehydration. Indeed, that this rehydration could be just as effective given orally as through an orogastric tube (for example, refs 2 and 3) made it possible for oral rehydration therapy (ORT) to be used in rural remote areas and truly impact on the morbidity and mortality of cholera. Indeed, Guerrant et al (1) highlights the use of oral glucose-salt packets in war-torn Bangladeshi refugees, which reduced the mortality rate from 30 percent to 3.6 percent (4) and quotes sources referring to ORT as "potentially the most important medical advance" of the 20th century. A variety of formulations of ORT exist, generally glucose or rice powder-based, which contain a variety of micronutrients, especially zinc (5).

"The assessment of the degree of volume loss in those with diarrhea to approximate volume and fluid losses can be found in ref 6 below. Those with severe hypovolemia should be initially rehydrated intravenously with a fluid bolus of normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution of 20-30 ml/kg followed by 100 ml/kg in the 1st 4 hours and 100 ml/kg over the next 18 hours with regular reassessment. Those with lesser degrees of hypovolemia can be rehydrated orally with a glucose or rice-derived formula with up to 4 liters in the 1st 4 hours, and those with no hypovolemia can be given ORT after each liquid stool with frequent reevaluation."
