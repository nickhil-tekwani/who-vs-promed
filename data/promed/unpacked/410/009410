Some districts in Western Province are reported [to have been] hit by a sporadic outbreak of anthrax. This has prompted the government to embark on vaccination against the disease to prevent further spread. Western Province Fisheries and Livestock Coordinator, Kelvin Kampamba has confirmed the development to ZANIS in Mongu today [Tue 22 Nov 2022]. Dr Kampamba said the province received over 40 000 thousand doses of anthrax vaccine to vaccinate all the animals in the affected districts. "The field staff is already in the field vaccinating animals in the affected districts," he disclosed. [The number of anthrax vaccine doses -- "40 000 thousand" -- looks like a typographical error. The probable number is 40 000. Would an informed source in Lusaka please clarify the number of anthrax vaccine doses supplied. - Mod.MHJ]

Dr Kampamba also revealed that the department is carrying out campaigns against foot and mouth disease (FMD) in a bid to sensitize cattle owners to be wary of the disease. "We are currently conducting campaigns against FMD in Mulobezi, Sesheke, and Mwandi districts so that livestock can take measures against the disease," he stated.

Dr Kampamba noted that cattle are a major source of livelihood for the people of Western Province hence the government's decision to provide vaccines to control the diseases that affect animals. He said that as part of the control system, the department was also branding the animals for movement control in the province. "Cattle branding is an integral part of the disease control system as animals are easily identified during movement," he emphasized.

And Mongu district veterinary officer, Mukuni Mubita, said livestock farmers were responding positively to the government vaccination exercise which has been going on for some weeks now. Dr Mubita said the district received sporadic cases of anthrax in some parts of the Nalikwanda Constituency where the disease is endemic. "So far we are moving on well with the vaccination exercise. Cattle owners are also responding positively," he said. And one of the farmers in Nalikwanda, Boyd Silumesi, thanked the government for providing the vaccines which he could not afford on his own.

Anthrax is a disease that affects warm-blooded animals including cattle. Humans can also be affected especially when one consumes an anthrax-infected carcass. [And there is a high risk of cutaneous anthrax when skinning and butchering an anthrax carcass, and handling the contaminated meat. - Mod.MHJ]

Anthrax has a long history in the Western Region. Linked with the present reports of ongoing "sporadic outbreaks" it suggests that the absence of reports since 2017 is possibly more a case of non-reporting than a true absence of cases. Fortunately, there appear to have been no human cases during this sporadic series. And, clearly, the Western Province Fisheries and Livestock Department is gearing up to stop further anthrax cases and coincidentally, making use of the mobilization of vaccination teams, to stop foot and mouth outbreaks, which is also very important. We commend their activities. - Mod.MHJ
