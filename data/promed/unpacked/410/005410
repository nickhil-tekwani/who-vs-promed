Influenza Vaccine Delay Expected Again Next Season
--------------------------------------------------
US public health officials predict that last year's delay in
distributing influenza vaccine will be repeated again this fall.
However, they project that the delay will not be as severe as it was
during last year's flu season, and that the required number of doses
will be available before influenza activity is expected to peak.
With regard to the 2001-2002 season, the Centers for Disease Control &
Prevention (CDC) stated in an announcement on Thu 21 Jun 2001 that 64%
of the expected distribution will probably be available by the end of
October 2001, twice the amount available at the same time last year.
The remaining doses should be available in November and December.
The CDC's announcement contrasts with statements made in March by Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and pharmaceutical industry officials,
who projected at a meeting of FDA advisors that there would be no
delays in shipping the vaccine. An FDA spokesperson told Reuters
Health today that manufacturers had just recently notified officials
of the projected delay. "Last year there were compliance issues, which
is not the case this year," the spokesperson said, referring to last
year's problems encountered in some companies making the vaccine.
This year's projected delay in influenza vaccine distribution stems
from a reduction in the number of licensed US manufacturers, down from
4 in 1999 to 3 in 2000. They are still working to increase their
capacity and expand production facilities, according to the CDC
announcement.
The CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that
health-care providers reserve vaccine doses that arrive in September
and October for patients at high risk and health-care workers. Mass
immunization campaigns should not be started until late October or
November 2001.
