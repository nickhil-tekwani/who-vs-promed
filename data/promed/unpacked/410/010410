The Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) reported [Fri 6 Apr 2018] the Washington State Department of Agriculture has confirmed a case of neurologic equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) in a King County horse.

"The horse was moved to an isolation area on the property and the premise has been quarantined," the EDCC's statement said. "There are 2 other premises that will be quarantined due to recent movement of horses from the index property to other equine facilities. Temperatures will be taken twice daily and strict equine biosecurity is in place."

Herpesvirus is highly contagious among horses and can cause a variety of ailments in equids, including rhinopneumonitis (a respiratory disease usually found in young horses), abortion in broodmares, and equine herpesvirus myeloencephalopathy (the neurologic form). In many horses, the only sign of EHV-1 infection is fever, which can go undetected.

In addition to fever, other common signs of EHV-1 infection in young horses include cough, decreased appetite, depression, and a nasal discharge. Pregnant mares typically show no signs of infection before they abort, and abortions usually occur late in gestation (around 8 months) but can be earlier. Abortions can occur anywhere from 2 weeks to several months following infection with EHV-1.

Horses with the neurologic form usually have a fever at the onset of the disease and might show signs of a respiratory infection. A few days later, neurologic signs such as ataxia (incoordination), weakness or paralysis of the fore - and hind limbs, urine retention and dribbling, loss of tail tone, and recumbency (inability to rise) develop.

The South Dakota Animal Industry Board says equine herpes virus has been confirmed in a horse in Lincoln County.

The board says the horse became ill and had trouble with coordination and walking. Lab tests confirmed the disease.

According to the board, the horse has traveled extensively in South Dakota for cutting and sporting events in the past few weeks.

State veterinarian Dustin Oedekoven says the disease can result in respiratory problems, abortion or neurologic disease among horses. Since the disease is contagious and can be spread between horses through direct contact or through contaminated buckets, brushes or tack, Oedekoven recommends cleaning and disinfecting feed and water buckets, stalls and trailers to prevent the disease from spreading.

The virus is not a threat to humans.

[Other horses at the facilities visited by a horse diagnosed with this disease should have their temperature monitored and recorded at least 2x daily, as a slight rise in body temperature may be the earliest and indeed only sign of illness.

If horses with neuropathic EHV-1 remain ambulatory or are recumbent for only 2-3 days, the prognosis is usually favorable. Valacyclovir (30 mg/kg, PO, bid) has shown promise in the treatment of affected horses and in prophylaxis during EHV-1 outbreaks. Intensive nursing care is necessary to avoid pulmonary congestion, pneumonia, ruptured bladder, or bowel atony. Recovery may be complete, but a small percentage of cases have neurologic sequelae. The neurological form of this disease may have a positive outcome but often does not.

If you are traveling with your horse for shows, sporting events, or other reasons, it is advisable to take the animal's temperature at a minimum twice daily and record the temperature in a notebook. Small rises in body temperature may be the earliest sign of illness. Traveling and competing can be significant stressors for the animal and possibly weaken its immune system.
