The Board of Animal Health detected a 2nd case of low path avian influenza in a turkey flock. This detection came in Stearns County, following a case in Kandiyohi County. Minnesota Turkey Growers Association Executive Director Steve Olson says enhanced surveillance and tightened biosecurity helped with this detection.

He says they learned a lot from the highly pathogenic bird flu outbreak that hit Minnesota in 2015, which has helped in dealing with these low path cases.

Olson says he wouldn't be surprised to see additional low path cases, but the best deterrent will be colder weather.

In last week's Stearns County case, the Board of Animal Health quarantined the flock of 13-week-old hens. They'll be tested and monitored until it's determined the flock is negative for the virus, and the turkeys can be control marketed.

[This article does not specify which strain of avian influenza this was. The previous case was low pathogenicity H5N2. Information regarding specifically which type of avian influenza would be appreciated.

It is nice to know something positive could come out of the horrible situation in 2015. Of course we do not want a replay of the situation in 2015. And we would welcome the cold weather to halt this disease in its tracks, so to speak.

It always takes continual vigilance to prevent and minimize disease. Biosecurity of workers and everyone entering the premises, including veterinarians, is vitally important. Prevention measures regarding wild birds and rodents are critical in keeping down the chances of an infestation. Part of biosecurity is early detection of one or a few ill birds. Fortunately, this seems contained to one barn. We hope it does not spread. - Mod.TG
