A puppy undergoing treatment for a broken leg at College Road Animal
Hospital exposed 50 people to rabies, sending an unusually large group of
people to health officials for treatment.
Robert Weedon, veterinarian and member of the county Board of Health, said
business is back to normal at the veterinary hospital after a hectic
holiday week involving post-exposure rabies treatment for its staff and
clients who came in contact with the puppy's saliva.
The black lab-mixed puppy named "Johnny" was in the midst of treatment for
a broken front leg when he started to have neurological symptoms Weedon
recognized as similar to those of rabies. The puppy was euthanized so he
could be tested. The state confirmed the stray had rabies on 22 Dec. His is
the 1st canine case of rabies New Hanover County has confirmed since the 1950s.
The veterinarians and staff scrambled to identify anyone who might have
been licked by the friendly puppy during his stay. Normally the virus
spreads through a bite, but it can be transmitted by infected saliva coming
in contact with someone's eyes, nose, mouth or open wounds. Once symptoms
appear in humans, rabies is nearly always fatal.
For the 50 people receiving precautionary treatment, the saga continues.
The post-exposure shots are given in a series of 5 over 28 days. Those who
started treatment the day the tests came back positive will have their 4th
shot Friday and their 5th about 19 Jan 2007.
Scott Harrelson, New Hanover County's deputy health director, said this
number of people getting exposed to rabies is unheard of.
"I've been dealing with rabies exposures for 7 years now and that is the
largest group that I have ever dealt with," Harrelson said. "We did have a
group in a pool in Duplin County that handled a bat during the day while in
the pool and then flung the animal into the woods. I think there were 7 to
8 people in that group."
The Board of Health commended Weedon and the animal hospital's staff for
recognizing the symptoms and heading off a potential public health crisis.
New Hanover Regional Medical Center also responded quickly to the unusual
situation by obtaining additional shots from nearby hospitals and was able
to treat everyone exposed.
"It's unfortunate but it's also fortunate," health director David Rice said
of the situation and response.

[Although the article states the puppy was a stray, it is suggestive that
rabies is in the area, and other domestic pets should be vaccinated against
the disease. Certainly the puppy may have been bitten by a bat, but it may
also mean that some other animal -- wild or domestic -- may have the
disease. - Mod.TG]
