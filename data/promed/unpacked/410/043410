Healthcare Authorities in China said on Thu [10 Nov 2005] that they
have quarantined 116 people in northeastern Liaoning province after 2
new outbreaks of avian influenza [in poultry] there. The province has
now suffered 3 outbreaks in less than 3 weeks despite a massive
campaign to contain the virus. The Chinese authorities did not make
clear the extent to which the 116 people in Liaoning were being
isolated. The country has imposed quarantines in other bird-flu
afflicted areas but in at least one case residents were restricted
only from leaving their village. The authorities also disinfected
homes, water wells, and streets within 2 miles of the latest outbreak
sites on family chicken farms in Liaoning, the official Xinhua News
Agency reported.
The latest outbreaks of the H5N1 virus in the cities of Jinzhou and
Fuxin in Liaoning began on Sun 6 Nov 2005 and killed 1100 chickens in
family farms, the Agriculture Ministry said.
China has not yet confirmed any cases of human deaths from the H5N1
strain, which has killed at least 63 people elsewhere in Asia. But it
has asked the World Health Organization to help it determine whether
bird flu killed a 12-year-old girl who died in a town where there had
been an outbreak.
The latest outbreaks in China have added to concerns that fake bird
flu vaccines for poultry were threatening public health after
officials reported an unapproved product was sold in Liaoning
province, site of the 3 most recent outbreaks. "This is something we
find to be a very unwelcome development," Peter Cordingley, a World
Health Organization spokesman, said in comments broadcast by Hong
Kong's Cable TV. "Quite clearly, there's a major problem in Liaoning,
and it seems from what the Chinese are saying this has to do with
using shoddy, inferior or maybe fake vaccines for poultry. And what
we have now, almost certainly we think, is sick chickens who are
showing no symptoms, and that is very, very bad. They are silent
carriers of the virus," Cordingley said.
The Chinese authorities have identified the source of the latest
infections as "wild animals," presumably migratory birds. The Xinhua
News Agency stated that the authorities had so far culled 170 000
poultry in and around Chaoyangsi village in Fuxin city and 500 000
poultry in Jinzhou's Daling village.
Bird flu outbreaks have been reported in the past month among fowl in
northern China's Inner Mongolia, eastern China's Anhui and in the
central province of Hunan. The WHO praised China's openness in
dealing with its bird flu problems. "We have to say from the WHO's
point of view, the political response from China was 1st-class. Very
senior members of the government were in Liaoning immediately," said
Cordingley, who was attending an AIDS conference in the southwestern
Chinese city of Kunming. "They've put a lot of money into this. We're
very happy with the response," he said. Health officials say human
infections are inevitable if China cannot stop repeated outbreaks in
poultry, and the government has ordered increasingly strict
preventive measures.

As China slaughtered millions of birds and banned livestock sales in
big cities to prevent a human outbreak of avian influenza, the World
Health Organization (WHO) China office urged the world's most
populous country to intensify protection against possible human
infection and the sharing of information and virus samples with other
countries. Roy Wadia, a WHO spokesman in Beijing, said it is
difficult and even impossible to find out how many people might get
infected in many Asian countries as a lot of farmers live side by
side with their livestock. He said the fact that no human infection
cases have been reported doesn't mean there are no such cases.
Praising China for the huge resources it has put into its anti-bird
flu campaign, he said it is "just a start", calling on China to stay
vigilant against human infection.
China has experienced avian influenza outbreaks [in poultry] in
Anhui, Hunan, and Liaoning provinces and the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region in recent weeks that have killed thousands of
birds, but only reported 3 suspected human cases in central Hunan
Province, currently diagnosed as "pneumonia of an unknown cause". The
possibility of human infection by H5N1 avian influenza virus has not
been ruled out, as all 3 ill persons had close contact with dead
poultry. A 12-year-old girl, one of the 3, died on 17 Oct 2005.
Viet Nam has suffered over 40 [currently 42 - Mod.CP] of the at least
62 [currently 64] bird flu human deaths in Asia since 2003. Southeast
and East-Asia have large populations whose livestock stay in backyard
farms or homes. Facing with the WHO's warning of a possible human
pandemic, China has toughened its measures to fight the highly
pathogenic virus. The State Council -- central government -- has
launched a national command center for the prevention and control of
bird flu and earmarked 250 million dollars to fund the battle.
Beijing also has announced a shut-down of all live poultry markets
and Shanghai has banned sales of live ducks, quail and other birds.
A groups of WHO experts is expected to come to China at the
invitation of the Chinese government to investigate the [human] cases
this week. A dialogue is underway between China and the WHO to
determine what the assistance should be. A WHO official suggested
China's agricultural ministry should improve its bird-flu policy.

[The status of the 3 suspected human cases in China has not changed;
the results of tests conducted so far have been negative. The
prevalence of H5 antibody in the Chinese population may be a
complicating factor impeding a conclusive diagnosis. - Mod.CP]
