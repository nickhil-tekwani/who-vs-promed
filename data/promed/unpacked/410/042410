Pet bird blamed for zoo disease
--------------------------------
A smuggled pet may have been the source of a deadly epidemic at an Aberdeen
zoo. Up to 80 exotic birds at Hazlehead Park's Pets' Corner will have to be
put down after being hit by the bug. Staff are investigating how the
highly-contagious disease, avian chlamydiosis, entered the facility.
It is understood the investigation is focusing on the theory a pet bird
with the bug was secretly released into the aviary.
Today a source in the city council said: "We are looking into the
possibility someone smuggled a bird, such as a canary, into Pets' Corner
and let it go without the staff's knowledge. This is the most likely
scenario, although we may never know for sure what really happened."
It is understood the diseased bird could have been a pet which the owner
did not want anymore but decided to release in a safe environment.
An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman confirmed officials are investigating
this possibility. She said: "We are looking at how this may have happened
so we can take steps to help prevent it happening again."
Unfortunately there is no definite count for the number of birds in the
aviary, making it more difficult to ascertain whether one has been smuggled in.
Staff may instead focus on their behaviour in the weeks before the outbreak
was discovered. The birds were known to gang up on and bully others with
which they were unfamiliar.
The aviary accepts birds from outside sources, but they would be introduced
gradually to ensure acceptance. On Wed 26 Apr 2003 the Evening Express
revealed a macaw was the first to test positive for the disease at the end
of last month.
Spread through the air and contact with other birds, the bug causes loss of
appetite, diarrhoea, respiratory problems, and is fatal in up to 80 [%] of
cases. 8 parrots and macaws were quarantined and put on antibiotics but 2
have since died. Distraught staff decided the other 70 to 80 birds would
find treatment too traumatic and decided to put them down.
The aviary has been closed to the public and is expected to remain shut for
the next few months while it is disinfected and restocked.

[Avian chlamydiosis (AC) is a zoonotic bacterial infection caused by
_Chlamydophila psittaci_, formerly known as _Chlamydia psittaci_ . In
humans, it can cause Psittacosis, also known as Parrot fever and
Ornithosis, which may lead to severe pneumonia and other serious health
problems. Infected birds -- usually cockatiels, parakeets, parrots, and
macaws -- shed the bacteria through feces and nasal discharges, and humans
become infected from exposure to these materials.
Updated information about psittacosis and AC can be found in the website of
the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA)
<http://www.avma.org/pubhlth/psittacosis.asp>.
The document -- "Compendium of Measures To Control _Chlamydophila psittaci_
(formerly _Chlamydia psittaci_) Infection Among Humans (Psittacosis) and
Pet Birds, 2003" -- has been issued by the National Association of State
Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV). It includes recommendations on
standardized procedures for controlling AC in birds, a vital step to
protecting human health. - Mod.AS]
