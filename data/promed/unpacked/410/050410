----------------------------------
Abstract

Background
Usutu virus (USUV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, which shares its transmission cycle with the phylogenetically related West Nile virus (WNV). USUV circulates in several European countries, and its activity has increased over the last 5 years.

Aim
To describe human cases of USUV infection identified by surveillance for WNV and USUV infection in the Veneto Region of northern Italy in 2018.

Methods
From 1 Jun to 30 Nov 2018, all cases of suspected autochthonous arbovirus infection and blood donors who had a reactive WNV nucleic acid test were investigated for both WNV and USUV infection by in-house molecular methods. Anti-WNV and anti-USUV IgM and IgG antibodies were detected by ELISA and in-house immunofluorescence assay, respectively; positive serum samples were further tested by WNV and USUV neutralisation assays run in parallel.

Results
We identified 8 cases of USUV infection (one with neuroinvasive disease, 6 with fever and one viraemic blood donor who developed arthralgia and myalgia) and 427 cases of WNV infection. A remarkable finding of this study was the persistence of USUV RNA in the blood and urine of 3 patients during follow-up. USUV genome sequences from 2 patients shared over 99% nt identity with USUV sequences detected in mosquito pools from the same area and clustered within lineage Europe 2.

Conclusions
Clinical presentation and laboratory findings in patients with USUV infection were similar to those found in patients with WNV infection. Cross-reactivity of serology and molecular tests challenged the differential diagnosis.

[It is interesting that this retrospective study found cases of Usutu virus infection, some with serious disease, in their tests of samples from northern Italy taken last year (2018). There have been sporadic cases of Usutu virus infection in humans and wild birds in a wide geographic area in Central and southern Europe. The 1st human cases of USUV infection were detected in northern Italy in 2009 in immunocompromised patients (https://www.eurosurveillance.org/content/10.2807/ese.14.50.19446-en). Subsequent seroprevalence studies and retrospective investigations suggested that the prevalence of USUV infection in humans could be higher than WNV infection (estimated to range between 0.3% and 3%) in areas where both viruses co-circulate (<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jmv.25230). With USUV infections occurring in birds and in humans in Central Europe, it is not surprising that USUV human infections reoccur in Italy. Both USUV and WNV are flaviruses. The above report underscores the need to be able to differentiate those cases from WNV cases. - Mod.TY
