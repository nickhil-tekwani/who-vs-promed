There are high numbers of trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, cases in the southern part of Bargu area of the Bagudo Local Government Area of Kebbi state, necessitating urgent remedial action. The Zonal Director of the Northwest for the Nigerian Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research, Dr Abdulkadri Abubakari, revealed this situation, calling on the state government to act fast.

The disease attacks the immune system of humans and animals, sometimes manifesting in sleeping disorders, hence the name. It also kills. In addition to trypanosomiasis, there is also a high case count of river blindness in the same area, although Abubakar said his institute lacked the statistics to show whether the diseases were also an issue in other parts of the state. But the institute zonal director urged the state governor Alhaji Saidu Dakingari to respond quickly in order to contain the disease.

He made the call while addressing Fulani and community leaders on the danger of the diseases at the Brinin Kebbi Local Government Area of the state. He added that the institute has started an awareness campaign in the state. "We are in the Birnin Kebbi Local Government area with my team to meet with the Fulani and community leaders of the local government on the activities of my office towards a campaign against tryponasomiasis disease," he said. "We want to let people know, especially the Fulani of group Miyatti Allah, that we have a zonal office here in Birnin Kebbi for the Northwest for the surveillance and control of trypanosomiasis and river blindness in case of any outbreak. My office does not have full statistics of the disease in Kebbi state yet, but the disease is not prevalent in the state, only in the southern part of the Bargu area in the Bagudo Local Government area of Kebbi state for now, but it [has a] high [case count]." He said trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) is a disease caused by protozoan parasites which are transmitted by tse-tse flies.

He further pointed out that the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that more than 60 million people are at risk of becoming infected with sleeping sickness in Africa, with 500 000 already infected, while 25 000 die every year. The disease is endemic in Nigeria.

Abubakar said the disease could be cured in its early stages with appropriate drugs, adding that it can be prevented by getting rid of the vector.

[According to the WHO (http://apps.who.int/neglected_diseases/ntddata/hat/hat.html and http://www.who.int/gho/neglected_diseases/human_african_trypanosomiasis/en/index.html), Nigeria reported 2 cases of human African trypanosomiasis, HAT, in 2010, the latest year for which data are available. Clearly, this is an underreporting. - Mod.EP
