Singapore's Health Ministry confirmed the 17th case of the
mosquito-borne chikungunya disease here on Thursday [8 May 2008].

The ministry revealed that the latest victim was a man, among the 4
new cases that caught the disease overseas recently. He believed he
caught the virus while playing golf at Jakarta's Jagorawi Golf and
Country Club a month ago. His infectious period is now over.

Since the 1st locally-transmitted case was detected on 14 Jan 2008,
so far 13 people have been infected locally, while another 4 caught
the virus overseas, the ministry said.

Its spokesman said: "The virus can be carried into Singapore, and the
presence of the _Aedes_ mosquito means the threat will remain."

Like the dengue virus, the chikungunya virus is spread by the _Aedes_
mosquito. Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent chikungunya
fever, which is characterized by fever, joint pains, chills and nausea.

The ministry said the best way to prevent chikungunya fever is to
take precautionary measures to prevent mosquito breeding around the
house and to protect oneself against mosquito bites.

[This is yet another example of how an arthropod-borne virus can be
transported rapidly via an infected, viremic individual from one area
to another. With competent vectors at the destination, the risk of
starting an outbreak is real. The most dramatic example of this hind
of long-distance transport occurred in 2007, when a chikungunya
outbreak was initiated in Italy following introduction of the virus
by an infected individual traveling from India (see ProMED-mail
archive no. 20071210.3980).

A suspected outbreak of chikungunya was reported from Kasargod
district in Kerala Thursday [08 May 2008]. The cases were reported
from Panathadi village, about 70 km from Kasargod district
headquarters. The village borders Karnataka.

A health official at the district medical office said that about 130
suspected cases of chikungunya were reported from the village. "The
patients complained of fever and joint pain. We have sent some blood
samples to the virology institute at Alleppey (in Kerala)," he said.

The health department is carrying out intensive mosquito eradication
work in the affected area. Last year, some of the southern districts
in Kerala witnessed an outbreak of chikungunya.

The disease is transmitted by the bite of _Aedes_ mosquitoes.
