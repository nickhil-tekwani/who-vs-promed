Health authorities alerted the population about the consumption of raw fish after detecting 6 confirmed cases and another 14 suspects of contagion with difilobotriasis [_Diphyllobothrium latum_] at Puerto Octay Hospital.

Also known as the tapeworm of fish, [_Diphyllobothrium latum_] is the largest parasite that infects humans. This animal has the appearance of a worm, can reach up to 10 m [approx. 32 ft] and is lodged in the intestines, where it is able to reproduce.

According to Las Últimas Noticias, the Health Seremi of Los Lagos, Scarlett Molt, called on the population to "be responsible with their health and avoid the risk of getting sick through the consumption of raw fish." He also warned that "food should be consumed and purchased only in established places, with sanitary certification."

The academic and member of the Chilean Society of Parasitology, Veronica Madrid, stressed that the parasite is common in dishes such as ceviche, sushi and even in "smoking processes that do not reach enough temperature to devitalize the larva."

According to the specialist, the only way to be sure of avoiding its presence in fish is to cook it or freeze it to more than 24 deg C below zero [approx. -11 deg F], something that can only be achieved at an industrial level.

[_Diphyllobothrium latum_ is only seen in fish caught in fresh water, not in salt water fish. A 10 years-old report from Chile indicated that a resurgence of _D. latum_ in Chile could be linked to salmon aquaculture (Cabello FC. Aquaculture and public health. The emergence of diphyllobothriasis in Chile and the world. Rev Med Chil. 2007;135:1064-71, available at: https://scielo.conicyt.cl/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0034-98872007000800016&lng=en&nrm=iso&tlng=en). Another study found that introduced trout in Lake Panguipulli was much more susceptible to _D. latum_ than the native fish (Torres P, Leyán V and Puga S. Prevalence, intensity, and abundance of infection and pathogenesis caused by diphyllobothriosis in vulnerable, native fish and introduced trout in Lake Panguipulli, Chile. J Wildl Dis. 2012;48:937-50, abstract available at: < http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.7589/2011-08-235?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3Dpubmed&>).
