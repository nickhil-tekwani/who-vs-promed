There is a measles epidemic in Bolivia. The Bolivian embassy in
Lima informs us [South American Explorer's Club] that if you're
entering Bolivia (both by air and land) and are under age 30, you
will be asked for proof of a measles vaccination. A vaccination with
a doctor or pharmacy and a note to this effect should be sufficient.
The note should give the Spanish word for measles which is
"sarampi√≥n". Check with the Bolivian embassy in your own country
before traveling.
Lloyd Aereo Boliviano (LAB) says that no charge is made for this
vaccination at the pharmacy at the Lima airport. Additionally, those
crossing into Bolivia by land without proof of vaccination must be
inoculated on the spot.
