Suspicion of foot-and-mouth disease [FMD] infection on a cattle farm in the village Vyshmanovo, Vladimir oblast, initially appeared last Saturday [15 Oct 2016]. The fears of the experts have been confirmed yesterday [19 Oct 2016]. Rosselkhoznadzor [Russia's Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance] said that more than 100 cows have been found sick at an agricultural enterprise. According to the prevailing guidelines, it was decided to destroy all livestock on the farm and to perform emergency vaccination of cattle around Sobinsky area. More than 80 000 vaccine doses have been sent to other parts of the 33rd region. The vaccination will be free of charge, the funds allocated from the federal budget. FMD can affect, in addition to cattle, also pigs, sheep and goats. Since yesterday, the entire territory of the village Vyshmanovo is under quarantine.

Olga Fedina, the channel correspondent 6: ... "The entrance to the village is now denied, the road to the affected farm is blocked, entrance allowed only to special service vehicles which are treated by a disinfectant solution prior to exit. All those involved in the activities carry masks" [picture included].

According to the vice-governor, the last outbreak of FMD in the 33rd region took place in 2007. The source of the virus which suddenly appeared is still unknown. The authorities do not rule out that this was done on purpose.

Roman Rusanov, deputy governor on agriculture: "We, together with the law enforcement agencies are conducting active work, we understand the virus is foreign indeed, it is more typical for the Asian parts of Turkey and Iran. It may drift but this may also be a sabotage. We'll have to find out" [see comment].

Nikolai Vlasov, deputy head of the Rosselkhoznadzor: "Theoretically, people may get infected by the FMD virus, but this is rare and mild. In fact, we have not observed such infection even among employees of our institute who work with FMD virus. The real danger of FMD is to the economy and not to public health."

Today, the Ministry of Emergency Situations held an emergency meeting on the outbreak. Its results will be known in the coming days. We will monitor developments.

[According to other media reports and to Russia's immediate notification to the OIE today [20 Oct 2016], the virus involved has been identified by the All-Russian FMD laboratory (ARRIAH) as FMDV serotype Asia 1.

According to EUFMD's most recent Global FMD Situation Monthly Report (August 2016, published early October), the WRLFMD conducted VMSD (vaccine matching strain differentiation) tests on field isolates collected in Iran during 2016 and belonging to FMDV serotype A, Asia 1 and O. Only isolates belonging to FMDV serotypes A and O obtained good matching results with some of the vaccine strains employed. In Turkey, FMDV Asia 1 was last reported in 2015 but may be assumed to continue its circulation. Both Iran and Turkey belong to FMD's "POOL 3 - WEST EURASIA & MIDDLE EAST", in which the 3 serotypes A, Asia 1 and O are known to be circulating. See pages 5-6 and maps in http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/eufmd/docs/FMD_monthly_reports/2016/August_2016.pdf.

The Russian Federation page in the website of WRLFMD indicates that the last year of occurrence of this FMDV serotype in Russia was 2006 (http://www.wrlfmd.org/fmd_genotyping/asia/rus.htm).

Genotyping of the virus strain involved in the current Russian event is essential for the tracing back of the infection source.

ARRIAH is located in Yuryevets, Vladimir oblast, less than 15 km [9 miles] from the affected farm. Laboratory-source exclusion is warranted. - Mod.AS
