Seven Montana cows have tested positive for brucellosis, and if at
least 2 cows from a separate herd near Emigrant test positive next
week, Montana will lose its brucellosis-free status.
That means Montana ranchers would have to pay to test all adult
cattle being shipped out of state until Montana can regain its
brucellosis-free status.
Gov. Brian Schweitzer said he expects the 2nd set of test results as
early as Tuesday [22 May 2007]. "There is a process you go through --
rounding up cattle, drawing blood, testing it., and then it's either
'Whew!' or 'Oh, my God,' " Schweitzer said.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (DOA) Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) is in charge of controlling the disease.
APHIS rules say that a state loses its brucellosis-free status when
at least 2 cows from 2 herds test positive within 12 months.
On 1 May 2007, 51 Angus cows bound for Iowa were tested for
brucellosis in Baker. Because Montana is a brucellosis-free state,
the cows wouldn't normally be tested, but because the cows were going
to be surrogate mothers, the tests were conducted. On 4 May 2007, the
Montana State Lab in Bozeman found that one cow had tested positive
for brucellosis. That cow was euthanized and tissue cultures were
re-tested at the National Veterinary Services lab in Ames, Iowa,
which conducts the testing for APHIS. The infected cow was traced
back to a herd of 301 cows in Bridger, and that herd was quarantined
after 6 more cows tested positive for brucellosis. The cattle came
from a ranch near Emigrant, Schweitzer said. A 2nd herd in the
Paradise Valley is being tested now.
To prevent the spread of [the disease] from bison to area cattle,
officials from the Montana Department of Livestock have hazed
wandering Yellowstone National Park bison back into the park. Last
year [2006], more than 1000 bison that ranged onto private lands in
Montana were captured, and most were sent to slaughter. However, the
governor said information he has received indicates that bison aren't
to blame. "It seems almost impossible this was a direct transmission
from Yellowstone bison to cattle. It could have been it came from
elk," Schweitzer said. "Or it could have been someone shipping cattle
into Montana from some infected herd in Texas or Mexico." Jeremy
Seidlitz, executive director of the Montana Cattlemen's Association,
expressed concern but said he feels helpless for now. "I really don't
think there is anything we can do but watch and hope," Seidlitz said.
"Losing the brucellosis-free status is very expensive in terms of
money and time."
[Brucellosis is a contagious disease in ruminant animals that can
cause fetuses to abort. It is considered one of the most serious
livestock diseases, primarily affecting cattle, swine, bison, and
elk.] Ranchers, veterinarians, and workers in slaughterhouses are
most at risk for the human strain, called undulant fever.
Montana has been brucellosis-free since June 1985. Wyoming found
brucellosis in its cattle in 2004, and regained its brucellosis-free
status last September, [2006]. Currently, Idaho and Texas are the
only states without a brucellosis-free rating.
Testing costs from USD 5 to USD 10 per animal, depending on whether
the tests are conducted at the ranch or elsewhere, said Ray Randall,
who owns Bridger Veterinary Service. "It's a significant problem," he
said. "The last time I remember having a brucellosis-positive herd
was in the '70s." Randall said he hasn't taken any blood tests for
brucellosis yet.
Even if the 2nd herd tests free of the disease, the 301 cows
quarantined near Bridger must be slaughtered, according to APHIS
rules. There is no immediate financial help for the owner. Indemnity
funds exist for ranchers who lose livestock to wolves, but not this
disease, Seidlitz said, adding that he has never heard of brucellosis
insurance.
Schweitzer said the bad news is reason to adopt his plan to test all
cattle within a ring around Yellowstone National Park. He has
proposed to APHIS that Montana be allowed to mark off an area of 60
to 70 miles (approx. 97-113 km) around Yellowstone National Park and
require that all the cattle moving in and out of the zone be tested.
If the disease shows up, only that zone would lose its
brucellosis-free status, not the whole state. "We would have caught
it at its source," the governor said. "Now we're in a position where
people long removed from Yellowstone Basin are being painted with the
same brush."
Meanwhile, APHIS spokeswoman, Teresa Howes, in Fort Collins,
Colorado, said tracing back and testing cattle is a long process, one
that's just starting in Montana. "The good news is that this was
found and it didn't go on to infect the national herd," she said.
"Now we're doing the investigation to make sure no other herds are infected."

[Animal caretakers, including veterinarians, are especially
susceptible to brucellosis from infected animals. Generally, when the
animal requires assistance during the birthing process, the person
providing the assistance is most at risk of exposure to the causative
bacterium _Brucella abortus_. This agent can be passed to humans
through unpasteurized or raw milk as well.
Brucellosis is commonly transmitted to susceptible animals by direct
contact with infected animals or with an environment that has been
contaminated with discharges from infected animals. Aborted fetuses,
placental membranes or fluids, and other vaginal discharges present
after an infected animal has aborted or calved are all highly
contaminated with infectious brucella organisms.
Cattle, bison, and cervids are susceptible to _B. abortus_; other
_Brucella_ species affect other animals. The animals experience a
loss of production (including abortion of the fetus), a drop in milk
production, weight loss, infertility, and lameness. Although the
animal may abort the 1st fetus, the animal may successfully carry a
fetus to term during the next pregnancy. Offspring may be born weak
or dead, without actual abortion.
The brucellosis eradication program in place for about 50 years has
almost eliminated the disease. Currently, only Texas and Idaho are
classified as Class A states, meaning they have a herd infection rate
of less than 0.1 percent. All other states are classified as
brucellosis-free. - Mod.TG]
