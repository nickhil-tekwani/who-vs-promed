Those in the local horse community say at least 3 horses have died and dozens more are now ill from possibly tainted feed at a Fresno County [California] farm.

Neighbors say the Black Fence Farm offers riding lessons and boards horses belonging to local teenage girls.

Clovis Veterinarian Dr. Troy Ford says he was the 1st on the scene of a recent incident involving a number of stabled horses at a Fresno County farm.

"Possibly a toxic ingestion at this time, but tests are still pending to confirm whether or not this is indeed true, but it does not appear to be contagious or infectious at this time," Ford said.

He says the toxic substance can sometimes be deadly to horses, or cause long-term disabilities to them, and there is no known antidote.

"It may be associated with the feed that these horses are ingesting, but we will know more in the next few days," Ford said.

Ford says he called on state officials to investigate the cause of the outbreak, which he says is isolated to the farm where it happened.

He says there's no reason for other horse owners to be concerned, and there was likely no malice involved.

"If it is going to be associated with the feed, it is going to be a mistake, there's no doubt about that," Ford said.

The feed company in question has not returned our calls, and one person present at Black Fence Farm on Thursday [24 Sep 2015] told us she had no comment. The California Department of Food and Agriculture [CDFA] confirms its feed and fertilizer branch is investigating to see whether or not the feed was the cause of the outbreak. Lab results are pending.

But whatever the outcome, local horse owners say this is a sad blow to their very close and caring community.

The CDFA also says this case is not being investigated by veterinarians in their animal health branch because a disease is not suspected as the cause.

[This article provides very little detail regarding the clinical signs causing the veterinarian to believe this was a toxic insult, and likely involved the feed.

However, if the veterinarian is confident it is not infectious, then it sounds like it may be related to feed or water. If it is feed, it is likely a batch of feed picked up from a custom mill where a mixing accident seems likely.

The article provides us with no description of clinical signs, but it could be an ionophore, a feed additive most often associated the cattle. Ionophores most often cause cardiac problems in horses.

Ionophores modify the movement of ions across the membranes of rumen microbes. While there are many biological responses reported in the literature for monensin, they can be consolidated into 7 categories or system modes of action. The modification of volatile fatty acid production is one widely recognized category of great importance. This shift in volatile fatty acids results in improved feed efficiency. Some ionophores also function as a coccidiostat.

However, ionophores are toxic to the heart of equines. There are a number of different ionophores and they vary in their toxicity to the horse. Sadly monensin is one of the more toxic ionophores.

While this type of toxicity does not occur often, it does occasionally occur and is sometimes the result of such a feed mixing error.

However, hopefully the results of the investigation and results of the testing will be provided shortly. - Mod.TG
