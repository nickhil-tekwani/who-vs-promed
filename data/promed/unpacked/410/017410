[The previous ProMED-mail post in this thread entitled "Tick-borne
encephalitis - Russia (Kemerovo)" reported the intended use of
immunoglobulin in the control of an outbreak of tickborne encephalitis
virus infection in the Kemerovo Region of Russia. The following comment has
been received concerning the use of immunoglobulin preparations in the
control of tickborne encephalitis virus infection. - Mod.CP]

Comment on immunoglobulin use and risk factors
----------------------------------------------
The administration of immunoglobulin carries a specific risk: besides the
usual risks associated with immunoglobulin products if given too late (that
is, in our recommendation, more than 96 hours after the tick bite, which in
fact only rarely can be determined precisely, especially in people with a
great deal of outdoor activity). Use of specific hyperimmunoglobulin might
lead to some kind of enhancement, which may in turn aggravate the clinical
picture.
Therefore the criteria for the use of gamma globulin as a means of
post-exposure prophylaxis were very strict, and as a result -- after
decades of use -- this product is no longer available in Austria, although
there have been several studies on its use. The recommendation was: up to
48 hours after the tick bite, 0.1 ml/kg body weight; after 48 to 96 hours,
0.2 ml/kg IM, which in the case of a 70 kg individual at 72 hours would
mean administration of 14 (!!!) ml hyperimmunoglobulin IM [Recalls those
happy days when the standard man weighed just 70 kg! - Mod.SH]. As far as I
know a statistically significant benefit of tickborne encephalitis
hyperimmunoglobulin has never been proven.

[Dr Ernie Gould (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Institute of Virology,
Oxford; <eag@ceh.ac.uk>) has also drawn attention to the potential risk of
antibody-dependent enhancement in relation to the use of immunoglobulin in
treatment and control of tickborne encephalitis virus (TBEV) infection. He
has provided the following information.
Enhancement with Langat virus (a close relative of TBEV) was described many
years ago: virus titre increased in Langat-infected mice pre-treated with
antiserum against Langat virus. (Webb HE, Wight DG, Platt GS, Smith CE.
Langat virus encephalitis in mice. I. The effect of the administration of
specific antiserum. J Hyg (Lond) 1968; 66(3): 343-54).
Similarly, the virulence of yellow fever virus (related to TBEV but less
closely than Langat virus) in mice increased in the presence of specific
monoclonal antibodies against the envelope protein of yellow fever virus.
(Gould EA, Buckley A. Antibody-dependent enhancement of yellow fever and
Japanese encephalitis virus neurovirulence. J Gen Virol 1989; 70(Pt 6):
1605-8; Gould EA, Buckley A, Groeger BK, Cane PA, Doenhoff M. Immune
enhancement of yellow fever virus neurovirulence for mice: studies of
mechanisms involved. J Gen Virol 1987;68(Pt 12): 3105-12. Erratum in: J Gen
Virol 1988;69(Pt 3): 763; Barrett AD, Gould EA. Antibody-mediated early
death in vivo after infection with yellow fever virus. J Gen Virol 1986;
67(Pt 11): 2539-42.)
Data of this type imply that the use of immunoglobulin may not necessarily
be beneficial and -- under some circumstances -- might be harmful to the
recipient. Dr Gould makes the constructive suggestion that if
immunoglobulin is deployed in the control of this TBEV outbreak in
Kemerovo, the local Russian medical authorities should examine their data
to determine whether antibody-dependent enhancement has affected the
outcome. - Mod.CP]
