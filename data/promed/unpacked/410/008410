Shigella outbreak strikes Bay Area
------------------------
The worst outbreak of shigella in 9 years is prompting Escambia County
health officials [this county and the city of Pensacola are located on the
Gulf of Mexico near the southwestern tip of the panhandle of Florida, close
to the border with the state of Alabama - Mod.LL] to warn the public about
the highly contagious disease that can be dangerous to children.
In August and September 2003, officials confirmed 104 cases of the
diarrheal infection in 11 elementary schools and 14 day-care facilities,
prompting warnings to local schools and child-care centers. Dehydration is
the most common complication. The outbreak is the worst since 1994, when
446 people in Escambia County were stricken, prompting federal
intervention from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
Caused by ingestion of the bacteria excreted in the stool of infected
persons, shigellosis can be treated with antibiotics, but officials say the
best way to avoid contracting it is to wash hands after using the restroom
or changing diapers and before eating. "We're concerned and keeping a
close eye on it. We're just re-enforcing good hand-washing," said Karen
Thoennes, health services coordinator at the Escambia County School
District. "If we've had a child with a case of shigellosis, we send out a
letter to all the parents in that classroom. Now that we have so many
cases, we want the whole community to be aware of it."
Health officials have been unable to isolate the source of this year's
outbreak. In 1995, shigella-related illnesses suffered by 29 Santa Rosa
County residents were linked to a single day-care center.
"That's the thing about this particular outbreak -- there isn't what we
call a point-source," said Pat Williams, epidemiology nursing supervisor at
the Health Department. "It's all over the place -- a lot of different
day-cares, a lot of different schools. It's geographically diffuse."
The highest concentration of the infection has been in ZIP code 32505,
which has recorded 36 cases in the past 2 months, she said [ZIP stands for
"Zone Improvement Plan". A ZIP Code identifies a specific geographic
delivery area for postal deliveries - Mod.MPP]. School health officials and
day-care workers are focusing efforts to keep their facilities
sanitized. "It's one of those things we have to react to because it can
destroy your business," said Amy Cordray, director of Shady Oak Nursery and
School. "We take universal precautions all the time. But when you get a
scare like this, you find yourself spraying all the handles and all the
doorknobs and everything constantly." Shady Oak has not reported any cases.
Escambia County health officials have reported 152 cases of shigellosis in
2003; 104 in August and September. In 2002, there were 113 cases; in 2001
there were 15.
Symptoms include diarrhea, fever, nausea, and stomach cramps. The disease
generally runs its course in 4 to 7 days but kills about 600 000 people
worldwide each year, said Pat Williams, epidemiology nursing supervisor at
the health department.
Williams broke down the cases in the past 2 months by ZIP code but found no
point of origin for the outbreak:
32501: 8
32503: 13
32504: 1
32505: 36
32506: 7
32507: 12
32514: 5
32526: 9
32533: 11
32534: 3
Health officials say the outbreak can be stopped by regular hand-washing
with soap and water: after using the toilet; after changing diapers; before
preparing food and before eating.

[Although the cases are distributed among adjacent zip codes, the most
cases among 2 adjacent zip codes were 49 (47 percent of cases in the past 2
months) in zip codes 32505 and 32503. It would be of interest to know the
distribution of the cases in each zip code over time. With almost a
majority of cases in adjacent zip codes, perhaps the index case or cases
were there. Alternatively, a food or water source could have spread the
infection in several zip codes. It is also not reported whether this is a
clonal outbreak. - Mod.LL]
