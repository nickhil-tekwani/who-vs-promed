Southern Missouri man dies of rabies
------------------------------------
State health officials report Missouri's first human death from
rabies in nearly a half-century. The victim is identified only as a
55-year-old southern Missouri man who died Sunday [30 Nov 2008],
about 6 weeks after he was bitten by a bat.

In a statement Monday [1 Dec 2008], the Missouri Department of Health
and Senior Services called it the state's 1st human rabies death
since 1959. That one occurred in Pulaski County.

Officials say the latest victim was bitten on the left ear by a bat
in mid-October [2008] and became ill with rabies symptoms [19 Nov
2008].

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed last
week that the man had a rabies virus associated with silver-haired
and eastern pipistrelle bats.

Rabies isn't spread by casual human contact. But 5 people who might
have had contact with the bat or the patient are receiving preventive
treatment.

State Health Department Reports First Human Rabies Death in Missouri Since 1959
Disease is rare because of public health prevention and follow-up

A southern Missouri man has died from rabies after being bitten by a
bat in mid-October, the Missouri Department of Health and Senior
Services reported today.

According to the department the man was reportedly bitten on the left
ear by a bat. He did not seek treatment or report the incident at the
time, and became ill November 19. Rabies was suspected after doctors
were informed about the patient's bite history and he began to show
symptoms consistent with the disease. On November 25, specimens sent
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were confirmed
positive and typed as a variant of the rabies virus associated with
silver haired and eastern pipistrelle bats. The 55-year-old man died
November 30. Rabies in humans remains rare, however rabies is almost
always fatal once symptoms begin.

State health officials are working closely with the local health
department to identify other individuals who might have had contact
with the rabid bat or close contact with the patient. Rabies is not
spread among people by casual contact. There are no documented cases
of person-to-person transmission of rabies in the United States other
than a small number of cases associated with organ and corneal
transplants. Currently, five individuals who might have had contact
with the bat or the patient are receiving rabies treatment to prevent
rabies.

"Unfortunately this sad case is an important reminder that people
need to avoid contact with wild animals, and need to report
wild-animal bites to health officials to determine if they are at
risk," said Dr. Howard Pue, State Public Health Veterinarian.

Pue said that while the disease is very rare in humans, it is not
uncommon in wild animals in Missouri, particularly in bats and
skunks. He said that Missouri has seen a larger number of rabid wild
animals this year. So far in 2008 the department has reports of 61
rabid animals: 55 bats, five skunks, and one horse. That compares to
an average of 54 total animals as of this date over the past 5 years,
with an average of 42 bats and 10 skunks for the same time period.

The last human rabies case recorded in Missouri was in Pulaski County
in 1959, according to Pue. He said that aggressive follow-up by
public health officials of people bitten by animals, effective
control of stray and wild animals by animal-control agencies,
vaccination of dogs and cats against rabies, and a more effective
anti-rabies regimen available for use by medical professionals have
all helped to make rabies in people so rare. The United States has
about one to three cases of rabies in people each year.

"It is important that anyone bitten by a wild animal or a domestic
animal, particularly a stray, should report the incident to their
medical provider to receive appropriate wound care, antibiotics and
tetanus vaccination as needed, as well as a rabies risk assessment,"
Pue said. He said the anti-rabies series of shots is very effective
in preventing rabies if administered before symptoms begin. However,
once the person bitten shows signs of rabies, death is almost a
certainty.

Pue said people need to take precautions to prevent animal bites and
possible exposure to rabies, including:

* Vaccinating dogs and cats against rabies.
* Reporting wild animals exhibiting unusual behavior and stray
pets to animal-control officials.
* Keeping pets under control and not allowing them to come in
contact with wild animals.
* Avoiding direct contact with wild animals and stray pets.
* Preventing bats from entering occupied spaces in homes,
churches, schools, and other similar areas, where they might come in
contact with people and pets. A bat found inside a home should not
be released or discarded, particularly if it was present in a room
where people were sleeping or in the same room with children or
adults who, due to their health or age, may not be able to describe
the extent of their exposure. Instead, an attempt should be made to
confine the bat to the room in which it was discovered and the local
health department or animal control agency should be contacted to get
information regarding what to do with it.

[In the United States, in contrast to some countries, rabies is most
commonly associated with exposure to bats. Since the exposure can
sometimes be just a scratch or slight bite, it is often
underappreciated by the victim, household members, physicians, and
veterinarians who may have knowledge of the case. Additionally, no
death from rabies may have occurred locally for the previous 50 years
and it is always hard to recognize as such a rare occurrence of a
disease.

As indicated in the 2006 MMWR (morbidity and mortality weekly report)
report of the death of a 10-year-old boy in Mississippi, bats are the
most common animal exposure (see reference 1 below):

During 1980-2004, a total of 56 cases of human rabies were reported
in the United States. Among the 55 cases for which rabies-virus
variants were obtained, 35 (64 percent) were associated with
insectivorous bats, most commonly the silver-haired and eastern
pipistrelle bats. More than half (57 percent) of these human cases
occurred during August-November, coincident with a seasonal increase
in prevalence of rabid bats detected in the United States. Despite
the substantial number of cases of human rabies attributable to bat
exposure, the importance of these exposures is often overlooked or
under-estimated.

The majority of exposures in humans were again from bats in 2005 and
2006. The epidemiology of human cases in the USA in 2004 was highly
unusual, including one young woman from Wisconsin who survived
clinical rabies and the exposure of 4 other people by transplantation
of organs and tissues (see summary below and reference 2 for more
details):

For the past several decades, the majority of naturally acquired,
indigenous human rabies cases in the United States have resulted from
variants of rabies viruses associated with insectivorous bats. The
lone human case reported in the United States during 2005 and 2 of
the 3 human rabies cases in 2006 were attributed to bat exposures.

During 2004, 2 of the 8 human rabies cases resulted from bat
exposures. One of these rabies patients recovered and remains the
only rabies patient to have survived without the administration of
rabies vaccination. Rabies was not immediately recognized as the
cause of death in the other 2004 patient, and organs and a vascular
graft from this patient were transplanted into 4 persons, resulting
in clinical rabies and death in all of the recipients.
