Background on leishmaniasis in Colombia
---------------------------------------
Visceral leishmaniasis:
- The first Colombian case of visceral leishmaniasis was reported in 1944
and about 100 cases were reported before 1980.
- The disease is currently commonest in the Magdalena Basin (Departments of
Huila, Tolima, and Cundinamarca. Other risk areas include the savannahs of
Bolivar, Sucre, and Cordoba; and areas of La Guaijara and Santander.
- about 23 per cent of opossums (_Didelphis marsupialis_) in the tropical
rain forest are infested by _Leishmania chagasi_.
- The local vectors are _Lutzomyia longipalpis_ and _Lu. evansi_ (in the
northern region; and the Caribbean coast including urban areas).
Cutaneous leishmaniasis:
- Cutaneous leishmaniasis is found in 91 per cent of all territory below
1750 m elevation. The disease prevalence is 5 per cent in some areas.
- 9369 cases were reported from 1981 to 1986; 55 888 from 1985 to 1996.
- _Leishmania amazonensis_ predominates in this form of disease, but
accounts for only [about 2 per cent of all _Leishmania_ species isolated
in the country. _L. guyanensis_, _L. panamensis_, and _L. colombiensis_ are
also encountered. _L. panamensis_ occurs in the western region, _L.
guyanensis_ in the Orinoco and Amazon river regions, and _L. amazonensis_
in Meta and Santander departments.
- _Lutzomyia ovallesi_, _Lu. quasitonsendi_ and _Lu. gomezi_ are implicated
as vectors in the north west. The local vector for _Leishmania panamensis_
is _Lu. (Nyssomyia) trapidoi_.
Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis:
- The disease is common. _Leishmania braziliensis braziliensis_ is the main
pathogen in the Pacific coast and central lowlands; and _L.b. panamensis_
in the western and southern regions.
- The prevalence is estimated at 0.4%. 600 cases were reported from 1981 to
1986.
- The principal vector in the western region is _Lutzomyia spinicrassa_
(_L. [Nyssomia trapidoi_ is also implicated).

Leishmaniasis is, of course, transmitted by sand flies (Phlebotomus), not
mosquitoes; there was probably a problem in translation.
It was remarked [in the previous posting that the continued armed conflict
is probably responsible for the "alarming" prevalence of the disease in
rural areas. Yes, and no. There probably are few, if any, areas where
active control of sand flies is undertaken at any time. I suspect [that
the observed high incidence of the disease results from the presence of
fighters from both sides of the conflict in rural areas, particularly at
night, where under normal circumstances they would never spend any time.
Thus, it is doubtful that the reservoir of infection has changed; there are
just more people being exposed due to circumstances.

[Thank you very much to Steve Berger for providing background information
on leishmaniasis in Colombia, and to Ellicott McConnell [and others! for
pointing out that sand flies are flies, not mosquitoes. - Mod.EP
