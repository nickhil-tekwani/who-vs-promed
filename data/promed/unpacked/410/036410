[According to information obtained from the WAHID database, in 2011 North Korea reported an event of FMD serotype O. A total of 139 outbreaks were reported in the provinces of Chagang-do, North Hwanghae, South Hwanghae, Kangwon-do, North P'Yongan, South P'Yongan, and P'Yongyang-Si.

The affected population was swine, cattle, and goats. In their final report sent on 2 Jul 2012, North Korea declared the event as resolved. See the report at http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/temp/reports/en_fup_0000012089_20120702_175055.pdf.

North Korea is divided into 9 "do" (provinces) and 2 "si" (special cities); http://www.statoids.com/ukp.html.

[2] South Korea: quarantine measures
Date: Thu 20 Feb 2014
Source: GlobalPost, Yonhap News Agency report [edited]
http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/yonhap-news-agency/140220/s-korea-intensifies-quarantine-stop-fmd-after-outbreak-n-kor


The South Korean government said Thursday [20 Feb 2014] that it has stepped up quarantine efforts to prevent the entry of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) following an outbreak of the animal disease in North Korea.

The Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs said the infectious viral disease broke out in the North's capital Pyongyang and North Hwanghae Province on 8 Jan 2014, citing the country's report to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) filed Wednesday [19 Feb 2014], more than a month after the outbreak.

The OIE notified South Korea of the outbreak earlier in the day, the ministry said, without explaining why the North was late in reporting the outbreak to the OIE.

The ministry said the possibility of the animal disease spreading from the North to the South was slim.

"The ministry has intensified its quarantine efforts at borders after designating a special watch period for FMD that began in October [2013]," it said in a press release.

FMD is an infectious and sometimes fatal disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals, such as pigs, cattle, deer, and sheep.

Both South and North Korea last reported an outbreak of FMD in April 2011. The South is currently seeking to regain the status of a vaccinated FMD-free country, which will help boost its exports of beef and pork.

[According to the most recent available periodic report of North Korea to the OIE, covering the 1st half of 2013, the routine measures applied for the control of FMD include vaccination. The notification above, the latest details on North Korea's animal population, and their FMD vaccination, are available in OIE's database for 2011, as follows:

Species / Population / FMD vaccine doses used:
cattle / 577 000 / 577 000
goats / 3 857 000 / 547 624
sheep /168 000 / 18 800
swine / 2 269 000 / 674 400

Both South and North Korea submitted to the WRLFMD (Pirbright) samples from their 2010/2011 epizootics. It was found that they shared the same virus strain, namely FMDV serotype O, topotype SEA, lineage Mya-98. Genotyping of the current strain is in need.

Hwanghae-Bukto province (North Hwanghae), southern to Pyongyang-si, is closer to the border with South Korea, which should be on high alert. The fact that pigs are involved is of significance for possible spread, since these animals are known as extremely prolific FMD virus emitters. Among the various mechanisms by which FMDV can be spread, airborne transport by wind deserves to be taken into consideration. Though this is an uncommon means of spread over long distances, requiring the coincidence of particular epidemiological and climatic factors, spread over hundreds of meters to several kilometers may be less rare. The topographical and climatic factors which favour airborne spread are a flat terrain, high humidity, low precipitation, and low to moderate wind speed; such spread may be particularly expected when pigs are the infection source and cattle are the targets. This mechanism of spread is important because infection can be carried beyond control areas and across borders and seaways.
