_Neisseria meningitidis_ W135: 2a: P1.2,5 arising from successive
pilgrimages to Mecca
--------------------------------------------------
Editorial note and background
After the haj pilgrimage in March 2000, cases of infection with a
particular strain of meningococcus ­ W135: 2a: P1.2,5 ­ occurred in various
parts of the world in pilgrims and their contacts. The Geneva office of
the World Health Organization (WHO) undertook surveillance of cases
arising out of this incident, and the European Commission's DG SANCO began
a rapid reporting system covering 6 countries: France, Germany, Ireland,
the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK).
This year the dates of the haj were 4 to 8 Mar 2001. Further cases of
meningococcal infection with a strain indistinguishable from last year's
have since been reported (see earlier surveillance reports from the
European Union (EU) rapid reporting system (1-5). An update from the EU is
provided below.
This episode of persisting meningococcal infection from one strain arising
out of successive visits to Mecca is unusual and of interest for several
reasons, some of which are discussed below.
1. Pilgrims to Mecca are required to be vaccinated with meningococcal
polysaccharide vaccine (6). Although a quadrivalent vaccine is produced, it
is more expensive than the bivalent A and C vaccine, and less readily
available. Moreover, the bivalent vaccine contained the 2 most common
groups and the haj-associated outbreak in 1987 was caused by a group A
strain. Hence few pilgrims used the quadrivalent vaccine.
2. It seems plausible that most pilgrims were immune to groups A and
C strains, but not immune to W135, and that this was why this serogroup of
meningococcus caused the outbreaks in 2000 and 2001.
3. It is unclear, however, if the W135 infecting strain evolved from
an A or C strain (to which there was already fairly extensive vaccine
induced immunity in the pilgrims) or was endemic in Saudi Arabia or Mecca,
or was brought in by one or more pilgrims. If it was endemic in Mecca, it
certainly wasn't common ­ the epidemiology of meningococcal infection in
Mecca showed that serogroup A accounted for 89% of 483 cases between 1987
and 1997 (7). Serogroup W135 however, although it accounted for only 6.4%
of cases, was almost twice as frequent as serogroup C (3.3%).
4. Extended international outbreaks of meningococcal infection with a
specific identifiable strain are rarely described. In 2000, cases were
diagnosed first in pilgrims, then their household contacts, then other
contacts and those with no known contact. Infection in those with no known
contact with pilgrims or pilgrim contacts suggests that the W135: 2a: P1.2,
5 strain has now established itself in many countries as part of the
endemic range of pathogenic meningococci, unlike the group A meningococcus,
which caused the outbreak in 1987. This strain did not appear to persist in
European countries, although a few secondary cases occurred. It is possible
that the W135 strain established itself also in Saudi Arabia or Mecca after
the haj 2000 outbreak if it was not already endemic there, because it
infected pilgrims again in 2001. The description below of the 3-year-old
boy from the UK whose parents visited during the Umra [an optional
pilgrimage to Mecca and not the haj supports this hypothesis.
In the update reported below, no cases associated with this year's haj have
so far been diagnosed in Ireland or Spain, the 2 other countries in the DG
SANCO rapid reporting network. The 6-month-old baby in France is probably
unconnected. The other 3 cases from France, both patients from Germany, and
the woman from the Netherlands (serology of her strain confirms that it
belongs to the electrophoretic type (ET)-37 complex) are almost certainly
part of the extended international outbreak. Of these 6, only 3 had direct
known contact with pilgrims. All the UK cases so far reported however
(except the 2 with unknown history) were pilgrims or their contacts.
Of the patients reported below, 3 (2 children and one adult) had septic
arthritis, an uncommon though well described manifestation of meningococcal
infection.
Rapid EU reporting system for meningitis W135: update
Between 24 Feb 2001 and 30 Mar 2001, 7 cases of infection with W135 or
compatible strains were reported from France, Germany, and the Netherlands,
and 11 from the United Kingdom (UK).
France
Meningococci of strain W135: NT: P1.6 were isolated from the blood of a
baby boy aged 6 months with no known link to the haj. Multilocus DNA
fingerprinting (MLDF) and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) showed
that this strain does not belong to ET-37 complex. Serogroup W135: 2a:
P1.2,5 was isolated from the blood of an 18-year-old man with no link to
the haj. MLDF analysis showed markers of ET-37 complex; 2 other cases had
direct links to the 2001 haj. _Neisseria meningitidis_ of serogroup W135:
2a: P1.2,5 was isolated from the blood of a 36-year-old woman, whose
mother-in-law had visited Mecca for the 2001 haj. MLDF analysis showed
markers of ET-37 complex. The same serogroup and serosubtype was isolated
from the blood and throat of a 76-year-old man with angina and fever, who
had been in contact with several pilgrims. The patient recovered. MLDF and
PFGE showed markers of ET-37 complex.
Germany
_N. meningitidis_ W135: 2a: P1.2,5 was isolated from a 6-year-old Muslim
girl with symptoms of septicaemia and septic arthritis of the ulna, and
from the knee joint of a 57-year-old female patient of German origin, whose
symptoms were septicaemia and septic arthritis. Both cases were confirmed
as having no link with the haj.
Netherlands
Meningococcal infection with strain W135: 2a: P1.2,5 was reported in a
female patient who went to Mecca at the end of 1999, but not in 2001. The
date of onset was 21 March 2001. The patients vaccination status is
unclear. She met her son-in-law (whose vaccination status is also unclear)
at the airport on his return from the 2001 haj. Detailed serological
characteristics of the isolate are not yet available.
United Kingdom
As of Fri 30 Mar 2001, 11 patients with _N. meningitidis_ strain W135: 2a:
P1.2,5 infection associated with the haj were reported in the UK. Several
of the cases have been shown to be indistinguishable from the strain
associated with the 2000 haj (8). Of these, 6 were pilgrims, 4 were
household contacts, and one was a non-household contact; 4 of the patients
died.
Other non-haj associated cases reported in the UK in the same period
include a case of W135: 2a: P1.2,5 meningococcal infection in a 1-year-old
girl whose parents went to the Umra in Saudi Arabia in autumn 2000. The
same strain was collected from the knee aspirate of a 3-year-old boy, whose
parents had visited the haj in 2000.
No further details are currently known for 2 cases of W135: 2a: P1.2,5
meningococcal infection: a 28-year-old patient who subsequently died, whose
link with the haj has yet to be confirmed, and a 4-month-old child.
