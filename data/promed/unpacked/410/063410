Report Update - 17 Apr 2001 [edited

An outbreak of bubonic plague in the Petauke district, eastern province
with 470 cases has now been contained. This disease is spread by
flea-infested rats. Early symptoms include fever, nausea, sore throat, and
headache. The risk to travellers is generally low but rodent-infested areas
and rat runs should be avoided.

[The prior WHO report posted on ProMED-mail cited 23 cases and indicated no
new cases reported over an 11 day period from 15 Mar 2001 to 26 Mar 2001,
leading me to suggest that the outbreak "may have been contained." The
source of information is not provided for this report, but if correct it
suggests that earlier case reporting to WHO may not have been timely and
reliable. - Mod.ES
