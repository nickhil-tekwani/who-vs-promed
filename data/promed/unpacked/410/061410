[One of the most under-utilized assets of ProMED-mail are its
Archives. When you examine the history of Rift Valley Fever in West
Africa through our archives, it is apparent that there is a cyclic
nature to the outbreaks in the western-most countries of West Africa
like Mauritania and Senegal -- just as RVF has a cyclic nature in East
Africa.

There were outbreaks in Mauritania in 2009 and 2010. This was preceded
by outbreaks in 2002 and 2003. Prior to that we have a series in
outbreaks in 1998 and 1999. But what is absolutely fascinating is one
of the earliest ProMED-mail posts in 1994 was concerning the emergence
of Rift Valley Fever in southern Mauritania and northern Senegal.
Scientist from The Pasteur Institute reported the following: 13
strains of Rift Valley Fever virus were isolated from _Aedes vexans_
and _Aedes ochraceus_ collected in October and November 1993 around
temporary ground pools in Northern Senegal. See the reference below
for details.

Another notable feature is that this cycle of outbreaks begs
verification that RVF occurrence can be predicted by climatic models.
RVF seems to be associated with above average rainfall and RVF
forecasting and climatic models can be useful in predicting outbreaks
as indicated on WHO fact sheet on RVF - see
<http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs207/en/>. The question
then arises as how well do climatic models predict this particular
series of outbreaks in Senegal and Mauritania and can they be useful
for further outbreaks? Another important question is how well
established is RVF in this region and when can we expect more outbreaks.

A summary of WHO information on climate models and RVF is given below:

Forecasting can predict climatic conditions that are frequently
associated with an increased risk of outbreaks, and may improve
disease control. In Africa, Saudi Arabia and Yemen RVF outbreaks are
closely associated with periods of above-average rainfall. The
response of vegetation to increased levels of rainfall can be easily
measured and monitored by Remote Sensing Satellite Imagery. In
addition RVF outbreaks in East Africa are closely associated with the
heavy rainfall that occurs during the warm phase of the El
Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon.

These findings have enabled the successful development of forecasting
models and early warning systems for RVF using satellite images and
weather/climate forecasting data. Early warning systems, such as
these, could be used to detect animal cases at an early stage of an
outbreak enabling authorities to implement measures to avert impending
epidemics.

Within the framework of the new International Health Regulations
(2005), the forecasting and early detection of RVF outbreaks, together
with a comprehensive assessment of the risk of diffusion to new areas,
are essential to enable effective and timely control measures
[livestock vaccination] to be implemented. - Mod.PC]
