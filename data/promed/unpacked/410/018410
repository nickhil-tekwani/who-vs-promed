_Fasciola hepatica_ prevalence increase in Ireland
-------------------------------------------------
High levels of liver fluke in all livestock have been detected in every
part of the country this winter, with the exception of the
Waterford-Wexford area. This was revealed yesterday when it was announced
that a new booklet on liver fluke has been produced by Teagasc and the
Department of Agriculture and Food. The 12-page booklet gives detailed
information on the causes, life cycles, symptoms, control, and prevention
of liver fluke.
Gerry Scully (chief sheep advisor with Teagasc, and one of the booklet's
authors) said that meat factories are reporting a liver infection rate of
10 per cent above normal in slaughtered sheep at present. In western
counties, up to 70 per cent of lamb livers are being discarded by meat
factories. "There are also reports from veterinary laboratories of sudden
deaths in lambs and adult sheep from fluke. This is due to large numbers,
often thousands, of the fluke parasite passing through the liver
substance," he said. The weather during last winter, spring and throughout
the summer was ideal for the spread of liver fluke. This has led to the
high infection levels. According to the authors, liver fluke costs farmers
over 25 million [Euros] annually, in animal deaths and lost production.
Sheep, cattle, and dairy cows are the main targets but horses, sheep,
goats, and dogs are also affected. The disease is also found in humans.
Wildlife, particularly rabbits and hares, act as reservoirs of disease.
The booklet, "Keep Fluke at Bay" is available from all Teagasc offices. It
is also available on the Teagasc website and on the
Department of Agriculture and Food website .

The Department of Agriculture and Food today issued advice to farmers in
relation to the threat of liver fluke disease in livestock. Meteorological
data confirm that rainfall at all weather stations was well above average
during spring and early summer 2002. An analysis of this data by the
Research and Applications Division of Met. Eireann using a disease
forecasting model suggests that liver fluke will be a major disease problem
in cattle and sheep during autumn and winter in all areas of the country
except for parts of Waterford and Wexford.
Already, acute fluke in sheep has been reported from the Regional
Veterinary Laboratory in Sligo. Based on recommendations from the Liver
Fluke Advisory Group comprising of experts from the Central Veterinary
Laboratory, Teagasc and Met. Eireann the Department is advising farmers to
treat sheep immediately. This treatment must be repeated at 4 to 5 week
intervals if the sheep are to remain at pasture during autumn and winter.
All flukicides must be used on veterinary advice and according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The Department also advised that young cattle
should be dosed immediately and again after housing. Older cattle need only
receive treatment after housing. The timing of treatment after housing
depends on the flukicide product being used. Outwintered cattle should be
treated now and this treatment should be repeated at regular intervals
according to veterinary advice. Dairy farmers should note that cows, which
can be affected badly by liver fluke, cannot be treated during lactation
and so should be dosed during the drying off period. All bought in stock
should also be treated for liver fluke.
