42 States Report Flu Activity; Alerts, Warnings Issued for 17 States
---------------------------------------------------
OKLAHOMA CITY: Increased flu activity is being reported in a dozen
communities across the nation for the week of 15 Jan 2001, according to the
National Flu Surveillance Network (NFSN) [a private venture from a viral
disease management company].
Communities being hit the hardest so far this winter flu season are
Atlanta, GA; Knoxville and Memphis, TN; Dallas-Fort Worth, TX; New York
City, NY; Oklahoma City, OK and the Tampa Bay area in Florida. Consistent
high flu prevalence across Louisiana prompted NFSN officials to upgrade the
State from Warning to Epidemic, the highest level. Over 100 positive flu
cases were reported to NFSN from sites in Louisiana during the past week.
According to the NFSN, an online disease surveillance service that
pinpoints and tracks influenza outbreaks in virtual real time, as of 15 Jan
2001, 17 states report influenza at the Alert status or above. Alert
status is issued when flu is being reported at least every other day in
moderate numbers. A warning is issued when flu is being reported daily in
high numbers.
The NFSN consists of nearly 6300 volunteer physicians at over 1100
surveillance sites located in all 50 states. "We continue to see sporadic
outbreaks of flu in various parts of the country. Flu is accelerating in
certain areas, primarily the southeastern part of the United States," said
Dr. Robert Hudson, Managing Director of NFSN.
"There are no indications flu is diminishing at this time, and we may be
several weeks from the peak of the flu season," Dr. Hudson cautioned. "Flu
outbreaks, however, have been at a minimum thus far, despite late delivery
of the flu vaccine. Last year flu peaked in mid-January. Indications
point to a later-than-usual flu season this year."
In addition to the states on Alert or Warning status, 25 states are on
Watch status, meaning influenza has been reported more than once within a
week.
NFSN physicians use a 20-minute point-of-care flu diagnostic test to try to
confirm the presence of Influenza A and B. Reports are filed with the NFSN
center in Oklahoma City, where the data are posted on the NFSN Internet
site at .
