DRC's 13th Ebola outbreak
-------------------------
Following a series of community deaths in North Kivu province, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the DRC Ministry of Health declared an outbreak of Ebola on [8 Oct 2021]. The outbreak is concentrated in Beni health zone. This is the 13th epidemic in DRC, the 3rd in North Kivu province and the 2nd in Beni health zone.

DRC's 13th outbreak - information as of [9 Dec 2021]; figures provided by DRC Ministry of Health via WHO:
- 11 total cases
- 8 confirmed cases
- 6 total deaths

Current situation
Two months after the outbreak was declared by the Ministry of Health, the epidemiological situation on the Ebola virus disease is currently under control. There has been a total of 11 cases recorded so far; 8 confirmed and 3 suspected. The last person with Ebola was identified on [30 Oct 2021].

More than 30 days have passed without any further new cases notified since [30 Oct 2021]; the last person was discharged after testing negative for Ebola on [4 Nov 2021]. Among the 8 confirmed cases, 6 people have sadly died.

The Beni health zone was one of the epicentres of the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is located about 50 kilometres [31 mi] from the town of Butembo. MSF teams have been involved in all responses, particularly in the face of the severe epidemic in North Kivu and Ituri, which was declared over in 2020.

A previous epidemic, the country's 12th, officially ended on [3 May 2021] in Butsili health zone.

MSF response
Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams continue to work with the Ministry of Health until the epidemic is officially declared over, during the last 2 decisive weeks for surveillance.

In Butsili and Kanzulinzuli health centres, our response focuses on triage, detection and isolation of people with suspected cases of Ebola. Our teams, alongside those of the Ministry of Health, carry out outpatient consultations, with free care for patients of all ages admitted to the isolation unit.

Our team rehabilitated and made structural improvements in Butsili, Kanzulinzuli and Mandrandele health centres. MSF also supplies medicines and food for the patients admitted to the isolation centre and their companions.

We also provided technical support to the surveillance commission by sending 2 epidemiologists, one of whom is an expert in Ebola virus management, and an MSF Health Promoter supervisor to support the psycho-social care commission.

They provide technical support for monitoring community activities in order to locate and identify contact cases in the community, but also social monitoring to all high-risk contacts through the distribution of kits, which contain a telephone and food, to encourage people who are suspected cases to self-isolate, and to limit viral transmission in the community.

People at high risk, including contacts of confirmed cases and first responders, have been vaccinated to contain the spread of the virus.

[This last Ebola outbreak, no. 13, has apparently ended as there have been no new cases in more than 30 days since 30 Oct 2021. The previous epidemic ended in May 2021. The expertise gained in the previous outbreaks plus rapid implementation of the vaccine especially to contacts of confirmed cases and first responders, have made a huge difference in the outcomes of the recent occasional flare-ups of Ebola. Unfortunately in this last outbreak, 6 of the 8 confirmed cases died; thus even while control of the spread of the virus is significantly improved, the virus remains highly lethal. - Mod.LK
