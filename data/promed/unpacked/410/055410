GEMINIVIRUSES, VEGETABLE CROPS - JAMAICA

Since the 1990s, the production of some vegetable crops in Jamaica
has been reduced due to whitefly-transmitted geminiviruses.
Geminiviruses are plant viruses that cause epidemics in food crops.
More than 20 viruses from Jamaica infecting vegetables (6 viruses)
and weeds (18 viruses) have been identified by the GSI (geminivirus
scene investigators) at the Biotechnology Centre at the University of
the West Indies.
The crop viruses include bean golden yellow mosaic virus (BGYMV),
which infects red peas and broad beans causing a yellow mosaic
pattern on the leaves. This virus is the major limiting factor in red
pea production, accounting for a 60 per cent reduction in red peas in
Jamaica since 1993. This has resulted in the importation of red peas
to meet local market demands.
2 geminiviruses -- tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and tomato
mosaic Havana virus (ToMHV-[JM]) -- were found infecting tomato and
scotch bonnet pepper. Symptoms include leaf curling and severe
stunting. TYLCV is the most devastating virus infecting tomato. TYLCV
alone, or with ToMHV-[JM], causes the 'Jherri curl' disease in
Jamaica. There are several tolerant tomato varieties in Jamaica
including Gempride, Gempear and Adonis and farmers are advised to
plant these instead of susceptible ones such as Castlerock and
Flordale.
Cabbage leaf curl disease:
2 geminiviruses cause cabbage leaf curl disease (CaLCD) in cabbage
and cauliflower. Cabbage plants infected with CaLCD have leaves that
curl up instead of folding into a compact 'head' which means the
farmer has no marketable product. Farmers in Douglas Castle indicated
cabbage varieties such as Resist Crown and Tropicana are tolerant to
the disease and should be planted by farmers instead of susceptible
varieties such as KY and KK. There are data which suggest that the
cabbage viruses also infect broccoli and this is being investigated
by the GSI.
In Jamaica, numerous weeds, including milkweed and broomweed, are
infected with geminiviruses. Some scientists have suggested that many
of the viruses in the crops may have evolved from the weed viruses.
In Jamaica, some weed viruses are able to infect crops in the
laboratory and this is being investigated by the GSI.

[The vegetable crop plants tomato (_Lycopersicon esculentum_), pepper
(_Capsicum annuum_), red peas a.k.a. cowpeas (_Vigna unguiculata_
ssp. _unguiculata_), broad (faba) beans (_Vicia faba_) and cabbage
(_Brassica oleracea_) in Jamaica are shown here to be susceptible to
several different geminiviruses (family: _Geminiviridae_, genus:
_Begomovirus_) transmitted by whiteflies (_Bemisia tabaci_). This is
the general case throughout subtropical and tropical cropping areas
wherever whiteflies are active.
Epidemics are driven by a highly efficient flighted vector that is
active for long periods of the year combined with a ready source of
virus pathogen in both weeds and infected crops, both of which are
reservoirs for these destructive viruses. The article recognizes the
increasing ability of national laboratories to correctly diagnose and
distinguish between the many different geminiviruses using specific
molecular probes.
Some selected ProMED-mail posts are listed below, but there are too
many related citations in ProMED-mail archives to list all of them in

begomovirus" in the message area (more than 80 hits).
