3 persons died and 8 others admitted to hospital following a cholera outbreak in Nyanza-Lac in Makamba province, some 150 km south of the Burundian capital Bujumbura, the health minister said Sunday, 24 May 2015.

"Very recently, Burundian citizens who had fled to Tanzania from Kabonga in Nyanza-Lac came back with cholera. We counted 38 cholera cases," said Burundian Public Health and AIDS Control Minister Sabine Ntakarutimana after visiting Kabonga.

According to her, other Burundian asylum seekers died of cholera in a transit site in Tanzania. "We took an opportunity to call on health services to address all cholera cases to avoid contamination in other regions through hygiene promotion," said Ntakarutimana. She commended the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Burundi Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders (MSF Belgium) for their presence in Kabonga to address the cholera issue.

More than 105 000 Burundian citizens are said to have fled their homes to neighboring countries since March 2015, fearing for their security ahead of the country's upcoming elections, with the 1st polls -- legislative and local government elections -- due on 5 Jun 2015.

Tanzania alone received more than 70 000 Burundian asylum seekers.

2 people have died of vomiting and diarrhea in Taita Taveta county while 24 others are admitted in hospital. Health officials in the county have however denied there is a cholera outbreak.

County health chief officer Catherine Mwamuzi said the 2 died from salmonella bacteria infection. "The 2 have died of diarrhea and vomiting," she said. Mwamuzi said the hospital has received over 400 patients suffering from the condition.

She said the samples taken from the patients have been taken for tests. "We have confirmed 7 _E. coli_ and 2 salmonellosis cases in our preliminary tests. We have taken the specimens to Kemri in Kilifi and Lancet pathologists for further tests," she said.

There is no reported documentation of cholera, but a large cluster of illnesses with deaths is certainly suggestive. Taita-Taveta County is a county of Kenya. It lies approximately 200 km northwest of Mombasa and 360 km southeast of Nairobi. It can be found on a map in southeast Kenya at: http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taita-Taveta_County. - Mod.LL]

[4] Diarrhea, prison - Uganda (Mbale District)
Date: Sun 24 May 2015

An outbreak of diarrhea was reported at Maluku government prison in Mbale district last week.

One inmate told New Vision that "a good number" of prisoners in different wards have suffered from diarrhea, and that there are more cases being reported.

He said this at the end of a month-long health camp held in Mbale municipality. The health camp was organized by State Minister for Trade James Mutende.

Another prisoner pointed at the nature of food they are served as a likely cause of the outbreak.

"We suspect that it is caused by the poor type of food we eat and the water we drink. Sometimes the posho [maize meal] is not prepared well and the rations are very small and yet we are overworked. The beans that are served can be seen floating on top of the soup," he claimed.

About 500 inmates received free treatment for communicable and non-communicable diseases with the help of a team of Hungarian doctors.

The health camp was also extended to the 3 divisions of Mbale municipality: Industrial, Wanale and Northern.

The inmates appealed to relevant authorities to intervene, saying that being behind bars does not strip them of their right to better services like proper health and feeding.

They also appealed to the government to include them in the indoor residual spray programme as a way of fighting the increasing number of mosquitoes that cause malaria.

Besides, they also want new uniforms, as the ones they are using are worn out.

According to Minister Mutende, the health camp was aimed extending health services to those who cannot afford to pay for services like scanning and treatment of other complicated diseases.

He said: "Mbale municipality is [densely] populated, with the largest number of residents living under absolute poverty; they cannot afford treatment for most of the diseases they are suffering from and are hence seeking assistance from our Hungarian friends.

"We need more equipment, drugs and a staffed prison health centre to address the challenges of prisoners."

He encouraged men to always escort their wives for antenatal services, and that parents should make sure that their children eat well and sleep well in order to remain healthy.

"When your children eat well and sleep well they are able to grow well, think positively and study well in classes. Take your children for immunization so they don't suffer from communicable diseases."

Brighton Nuwagaba, who represented the officer in charge at Namatala Health Centre IV, said that the facility lacks a scanning machine, dentists, a theater, a standby ambulance, and that it is also short of furniture, beds and staff.

He said the centre receives over 210 patients a day and that 5-10 patients are admitted daily. Nevertheless, he hailed the National Medical Stores (NMS) for timely delivery of drugs.

The team leader of the Hungarian doctors, Lukas Balaz, said that several residents who turned up for treatment suffered complications caused by lack of drinking enough water, skin rashes, sexually transmitted diseases, poor hygiene and poor feeding.

"Over 70 percent of the patients we have seen and treated are suffering from stomach-related complications and upsets."

For their part, the residents hailed the minister and the Hungarian team for extending free health services to residents who cannot afford private clinics.

Michael Sakwa, the 2nd in-charge at Maluku prisons, confirmed that prison health records indicate that malaria cases are also on the rise, with cases of diarrhea among the inmates.

"We have always referred complicated cases to Mbale referral hospital or to Murchison Falls in Kampala. We appeal for more staff and the latest machines that will help in diagnosing complicated diseases among inmates," he said.
