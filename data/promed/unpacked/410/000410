China has culled 80 000 chickens in the country's north after detecting an outbreak of H7N9 bird flu on a farm of layer hens, said the agriculture ministry on [Fri 5 May 2017]. A total of 5000 hens on the farm in Xingtai in Hebei province died in late April [2017], said the ministry, and another 8500 hens were infected with the disease. After confirming infection with the H7N9 virus, authorities ordered the culling of 80 057 poultry. The outbreak is under control, added the statement.

Infection with bird flu usually peaks during winter months and tails off in the spring but cases of H7N9 have been unusually high in the country since last year [2016].

More than 200 people have died since last October [2016] and new cases continue to be reported, with the latest fatality occurring in Shaanxi province this week [week of 30 Apr 2017].

Outbreaks among birds have spread northwards, and the virus has evolved from a low pathogenic one into one with more serious symptoms.

[Mainland China officially reported the detection of a highly pathogenic H7N9 virus strain in samples from Guangdong Province collected in January 2017 from several live bird markets and from 2 human cases with known exposure to live birds. These strains, which are similar to the circulating influenza A(H7N9) virus, showed a mutation leading to multiple basic amino acids at the cleavage site: a sign for high pathogenicity in poultry. Earlier, the circulating H7N9 zoonotic strain did not cause clinical disease in poultry and was termed LPAI H7N9 (of low pathogenicity).

It appears that the lab-observed high pathogenicity is now manifested in clinical disease and mortality in poultry, as expected. The concern this situation caused, when initially discovered, was expressed by the involvement of China's highest ranking authorities in the handling of the issue (see item 1 in 20170223.4860229), including the extensive closures of live bird markets.

The recent weekly FAO update of the H7N9 situation in China, including map and table, was published on 5 May 2017: see http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/programmes/en/empres/h7n9/situation_update.html. - Mod.AS
