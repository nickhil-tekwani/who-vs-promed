[1] USA: Motorcycle rally superspreading event
Date: Sun 6 Sep 2020

When officials in South Dakota allowed the annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis to go on with virtually no coronavirus precautions, any rational person knew bad news wouldn't be far behind. And so the inevitable is coming to pass: States are beginning to report cases of COVID-19 stemming from the rally.

Media reports last week showed that at least 12 states had reported cases connected to Sturgis. The number of people infected had surpassed 260, and the 1st known COVID-19 death from the event occurred in Minnesota last week.

Given that the 10-day rally drew some 400 000 people, those numbers may not sound that bad. But epidemiologists say the actual number is likely much higher. Limited contact-tracing ability in some states is artificially reducing the case numbers, they say. Plus, there was a strong thread of disdain in the crowd for testing and other safety measures.

And no doubt, the numbers are going to go higher. That's what happens when you get hundreds of thousands of people flouting basic public health standards during a pandemic by crowding into bars, shops and campgrounds in a tiny town. If you've ever been to the rally, you know that social distancing would be practically impossible. Bikes are parked handlebar-to-handlebar for blocks, and the sidewalks and buildings are packed.

Worse yet, officials in South Dakota took a wild-west approach on the event that only emboldened participants not to wear masks, distance themselves or, better yet, just skip the trip for a year. That brought out a crowd heavy on "no-mask" types who see personal protective equipment as a symbol of oppression, and business closures as government overreach. Contrast that with Las Vegas, where the sheer size of the resorts allows people to spread out, where properties are under mandate to provide distancing and practice good sanitation, and where visitors and staff are expected to wear masks.

And speaking of contrasts, Las Vegas' biggest biker event -- the annual BikeFest week -- would be right around the corner if the organizers hadn't done the responsible thing and canceled it this year [2020]. It's only a fraction of the size of the Sturgis rally, at about 30 000 participants annually, but pulling the event this year will keep a lot of people safe here and beyond. The event draws bikers from across the country.

Hopefully, the aftermath of the superspreader event in Sturgis will help convince the no-maskers that they're misguided.

Let's state this for the umpteenth time: Wearing a mask helps keep others from contracting the disease, and also benefits the wearer by reducing the viral load upon infection. That gives the immune system a better chance of contending with the virus early on without becoming overloaded, which can make the difference between getting a mild case and being hospitalized.

Meanwhile, business closures and capacity mandates reduce the spread and ease pressure on medical facilities.

Neither closures nor PPE are the tools of some takeover of our democracy. Period.

The cruel irony of the Sturgis rally this year [2020] is that it was promoted as a celebration of American freedom and individual liberties. But in actuality, it was an assault on social responsibility. Who knows how many participants were infected, and how many of their family members, friends, co-workers, etc., will suffer COVID-19 via contact with them? Ask those unwitting victims how free they feel about the rights of individuals versus the responsibility to protect others. We're guessing they'll fall on the side of taking precautions to keep our fellow citizens safe.

Meanwhile, here's hoping that as the case numbers rise, common sense will kick in and Sturgis will be the last mass-population event for the foreseeable future. If that happens, at least one good thing will come out of the rally.

[2] Cardiac manifestations
Date: Fri 3 Sep 2020
Source: American Heart Association News [edited]
https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/09/03/what-covid-19-is-doing-to-the-heart-even-after-recovery


A growing number of studies suggest many COVID-19 survivors experience some type of heart damage, even if they didn't have underlying heart disease and weren't sick enough to be hospitalized. This latest twist has health care experts worried about a potential increase in heart failure.

"Very early into the pandemic, it was clear that many patients who were hospitalized were showing evidence of cardiac injury," said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, chief of the division of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. "More recently, there is recognition that even some of those COVID-19 patients not hospitalized are experiencing cardiac injury. This raises concerns that there may be individuals who get through the initial infection, but are left with cardiovascular damage and complications."

Fonarow said these complications, such as myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, could lead to an increase in heart failure down the road. He's also concerned about people with pre-existing heart disease who don't have COVID-19 but who avoid coming into the hospital with heart problems out of fear of being exposed to the virus.

"The late consequences of that could be an increase in heart failure," he said. "It is much safer if having symptoms that could represent heart attack or stroke, to come into the emergency department than to try to ride it out at home."

Nearly 1/4th of those hospitalized with COVID-19 have been diagnosed with cardiovascular complications, which have been shown to contribute to roughly 40% of all COVID-19-related deaths. But 2 recent studies suggest heart damage among those infected may be more widespread. In JAMA Cardiology, an analysis of autopsies done on 39 COVID-19 patients identified infections in the hearts of patients who had not been diagnosed with cardiovascular issues while they were ill.

Another JAMA Cardiology study used cardiac MRIs on 100 people who had recovered from COVID-19 within the past 2 to 3 months. Researchers found abnormalities in the hearts of 78% recovered patients and "ongoing myocardial inflammation" in 60%. The same study found high levels of the blood enzyme troponin, an indicator of heart damage, in 76% of patients tested, although heart function appeared to be generally preserved. Most patients in the study had not required hospitalization.

"There's a group of people who seem to be more affected from the cardiac point of view," said Dr. Mina Chung, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University. But, she said, it can be difficult to identify who is at risk, or for those recovering from the virus to know if they're having heart problems."

"A lot of people end up feeling exhausted for a while. They can't get up to the exertion level they were at before. But it's difficult to tease out whether or not it's the lungs taking a little more time to heal or whether it's a cardiac issue," said Chung, who is leading the coordination of more than a dozen ongoing COVID-19 research studies funded by the American Heart Association. "If things continue to get better with time, that's a good sign," she said. "It's not unexpected that if you have not been active for a while, you get deconditioned and may have shortness of breath if you push yourself."

Whether screenings to detect cardiovascular damage should become a routine part of follow-up care for COVID-19 patients remains unclear.

"The bottom line is, we don't know," said Fonarow, who co-authored an editorial accompanying the 2 JAMA Cardiology studies. "Before any recommendations are made for routine cardiac imaging, we need additional studies that help identify the frequency of this occurring and what the risk factors are."

Chung and Fonarow advise those recovering from COVID-19 to watch for the following symptoms and to consult their physician or a cardiologist if they experience them: increasing or extreme shortness of breath with exertion, chest pain, swelling of the ankles, heart palpitations or an irregular heartbeat, not being able to lie flat without shortness of breath, waking up at night short of breath, lightheadedness or dizzy spells.

"But for someone who has had COVID-19 and recovered with no symptoms of heart trouble," Fonarow said, "it's unknown whether there is a reason to have additional screenings. If there are concerns, they should discuss this with their physicians."

It's also possible that some of the cardiovascular damage researchers are seeing could heal itself, he said. "We've seen with other viruses where there is inflammation of the heart, there are individuals for whom there is spontaneous recovery," Fonarow said. "And in some people, we can treat this effectively with medication. The question becomes specifically with COVID-19, what is that frequency and does it differ from other viruses that infect the heart."

This is a preview of the papers cited below. Cardiovascular effects following COVID must be documented to determine how common they are in people who apparently recovered. This disease presents increasingly broad pathologies. - Mod.LK]

Key Points
Question: What are the cardiovascular effects in unselected patients with recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

Findings: In this cohort study including 100 patients recently recovered from COVID-19 identified from a COVID-19 test center, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed cardiac involvement in 78 patients (78%) and ongoing myocardial inflammation in 60 patients (60%), which was independent of preexisting conditions, severity, and overall course of the acute illness, and the time from the original diagnosis.

Meaning: These findings indicate the need for ongoing investigation of the long-term cardiovascular consequences of COVID-19.

Key Points
Question: Can severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) be documented in cardiac tissue of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) autopsy cases?

Findings: In this cohort study of 39 autopsy cases of patients with COVID-19, cardiac infection with SARS-CoV-2 was found to be frequent but not associated with myocarditis-like influx of inflammatory cells into the myocardium.

Meaning: Among individuals with cardiac infection, overt myocarditis was not observed in the acute phase, but the long-term consequences of this cardiac infection need to be studied.

"Carnage in a lab dish shows how the coronavirus may damage the heart. [Byline: Elizabeth Cooney]

Maybe we should think of Covid-19 as a heart disease. When SARS-CoV-2 virus was added to human heart cells grown in lab dishes, the long muscle fibers that keep hearts beating were diced into short bits, alarming scientists at the San Francisco-based Gladstone Institutes, especially after they saw a similar phenomenon in heart tissue from Covid-19 patients' autopsies.

Their experiments could potentially explain why some people still feel short of breath after their Covid infections clear and add to worries that survivors may be at risk for future heart failure."

bioRxiv 2020.08.25.265561; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.25.265561

Abstract
COVID-19 causes cardiac dysfunction in up to 50% of patients, but the pathogenesis remains unclear. Infection of human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with SARS-CoV-2 revealed robust transcriptomic and morphological signatures of damage in cardiomyocytes. These morphological signatures include a distinct pattern of sarcomere fragmentation, with specific cleavage of thick filaments, and numerous iPSC-cardiomyocytes that lacked nuclear DNA. Human autopsy specimens from COVID-19 patients also displayed marked sarcomeric disruption and similar fragmentation, as well as prevalently enucleated cardiomyocytes. These striking transcriptomic and cytopathic changes provide a roadmap to understand the mechanisms of COVID-19 cardiac damage, search for potential treatments, and determine the basis for prolonged cardiac morbidity observed in this pandemic.

Did COVID-19 Mess Up My Heart?
I got sick six months ago. Now I can barely make it up the stairs. [Byline: Deborah Copaken]

An array of cardiac dysfunctions has cropped up, confounding researchers and revealing that COVID-19 is a far more complicated and potentially long-lasting disease than people initially expected. These heart ailments have especially gained attention from sports: Some college football players who have had COVID-19 are sitting out this season with myocarditis, a rare condition that can be fatal if untreated. The Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez is doing the same.

---
Reading the collection of publications and media reports on the cardiac manifestations is sobering re: the apparent cardiotropic effects of infection with the SARS-CoV-2. Reading the report of Puntmann VO et al showing that 78% of 100 COVID-19 recoveries among individuals with severe disease were documented to have cardiac involvement is sobering. In Lindner et al, autopsy demonstrated apparent invasive infected macrophages. What awaits to be addressed is what proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in cardiac disease compared with the proportion with severe disease as mentioned in the above publications. - Mod.MPP]

[The number of countries and territories reporting confirmed cases of COVID-19 to WHO remains at 215. A note of caution interpreting today's [6 Sep 2020] and tomorrow's data. These data represent the data reported to WHO up though 2:14 PM on Sun 6 Sep 2020. During the weekends, there are countries which do not report to WHO, and there are administrative divisions within countries which do not report to their government on the weekend. Hence, most regional newly confirmed cases and reported deaths are decreased over the weekend. This occurs often on Mondays as well, as most of the data reported on Mondays was collected on Sundays.

Data by country, area, or territory for 6 Sep 2020 can be accessed at https://promedmail.org/wp-content/uploads/world-pdf/WHO%20daily%20tablesSept6_1599437633.pdf.

- The Americas region reported 49.0% of daily case numbers and 62.1% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, maintaining its position as the most severely affected region, having reported more than 14 million cases. Brazil and the USA are dominant, followed by Argentina, Colombia, Peru, and Mexico.

- The European region reported 10.6% of daily case numbers and 5.8% of the daily deaths reported in the past 24 hours, and total cumulative cases reported exceed 4.4 million. Countries not reporting to WHO today [6 Sep 2020] include Spain, Israel, Belgium and Sweden. The dominant country is France, followed by Russia, Ukraine, Italy and Turkey.

- The Eastern Mediterranean region reported 4.8% of daily case numbers and 5.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of greater than 1.9 million cases. Iraq remains the dominant country, followed by Iran, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait.

- The African region reported 1.5% of daily case numbers and 2.7% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours and has reported more than one million cases. While South Africa remains the dominant country, the numbers have been lower than in previous days and weeks, followed by Ethiopia, Algeria, Namibia, Uganda, Nigeria and Kenya.

- The Western Pacific region reported 1.2% of daily case numbers and 1.4% of the deaths reported in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of 0.51 million cases. The Philippines continues to dominate, followed by Japan and South Korea.

- The South East Asia region reported 32.9% of the daily newly reported cases and 22.4% of reported deaths in the past 24 hours, having reported a cumulative total of more than 4.6 million cases. India continues to dominate followed by Indonesia and Bangladesh.

Europe, while experiencing resurgences in many countries related to loosening restrictions and the summer vacation period, is overshadowed by the major transmission ongoing in South East Asia, specifically India. Noteworthy is that the Italian MOH data today [6 Sep 2020] on mortality shows an increase of 60% in comparing 7-day averages.

On the Overview tab at the WHO source URL, the epidemic curve of confirmed COVID-19 cases by WHO region, 30 Dec 2019 through 6 Sep 2020 is an excellent visual representation of the epidemic. - Mod.MPP]

[The USA, Brazil, and India are still the most severely affected countries in terms of cumulative case counts and daily new case confirmations. In the past 24 hours, these 3 countries -- India (91 723), followed by the USA (29 098) and Brazil (14 606) -- account for over half of all confirmed cases globally (54.2%) and 59.6% of all newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours. A global total of 3842 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours (5-6 Sep 2020).

Countries reporting more than 5000 newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include India, USA, Brazil, Colombia (8065), France (7071), Argentina (6986), Peru (6275), and Russia (5195), and 25 countries have reported more than 1000 cases in the past 24 hours. Known high transmission countries not reporting any newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours include: Spain, Bolivia, Ecuador, Sweden, Costa Rica and Ghana.

Comparing the 7-day averages of daily confirmed cases from the past 7 days and those from 8-14 days ago, there is an increase of 5.9%, while daily reported deaths have decreased by 2.8%.

Impression: The European region is seeing increasing cases in western European countries that had markedly reduced transmission in late spring. India seems to be reporting newly confirmed cases breaking prior high daily cases on a regular basis. The most severely affected region remains the Americas, even with the weekend reporting artifacts. - Mod.MPP]
