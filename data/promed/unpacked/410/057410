HK to import more live chickens daily from mainland
-----------------------------------------------
On Fri 23 Apr, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government
announced that they will increase the daily quantities of imported live
chickens from the Chinese Mainland to 12 000 on 25 Apr 2004. The government
made the decision following a review of the Phase I arrangement for
resumption of Mainland imports on a pilot basis.
During Phase I of the pilot arrangement -- effective 20-22 Apr 2004 -- 3
consignments of about 6000 chickens were imported from the Mainland each day.
A spokesman for the Health, Welfare, and Food Bureau said that the
government had reviewed the results of the Phase I arrangement and had
determined that the daily quantities of imported live chickens could be
increased to 12 000 on 25 Apr -- after the wholesale market rest days --
for a further 5-day period until 29 Apr 2004.
Towards the end of Apr 2004, further reviews will be done concerning the
daily quantities of live chickens to be imported -- with consideration
being given to the latest situation -- the spokesman said. According to the
spokesman, relevant departments had been closely monitoring the health
conditions of the imports, and the clinical examination of these chickens
showed that they were in very good health.
He added that the laboratory test results for the consignments also showed
that all fecal samples were negative for avian influenza H5 virus, and the
antibody test results of all blood samples were satisfactory.

[No details on the tests -- applied at both ends during "phase I
arrangement" of the pilot plan, and which seem to be continued in the
following stages -- have been disclosed so far. It may be assumed that the
mentioned "antibody test results" are meant to verify that the birds had
been vaccinated with an heterologous vaccine within the application of a
'DIVA' (Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals) strategy. Hong
Kong has been applying an inactivated (heterologous) H5N2 vaccine for
several years. Confirmation from HK sources will be helpful. - Mod.AS]
