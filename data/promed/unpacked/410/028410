Canada's orchards will be undergoing an inspection blitz to help halt the
spread of a virus that threatens the Niagara Peninsula's $40 million tender
fruit industry. Peach- and plum-growing areas in Nova Scotia, British
Columbia and other parts of southern Ontario will be examined for signs of
the plum pox virus, which has so far turned up in 4 pockets in Niagara and
will require the destruction of 40 000 trees to try and keep it in check.
Other areas in Ontario to be looked at include stone fruit orchards around
Leamington, Harrow, Simcoe and Arkona, northwest of Sarnia. B.C.'s tender
fruit business is Canada's second largest behind Ontario. The Okanagan
Valley industry, which grows apricots, peaches, plums and cherries, had
sales worth $13 million last year. Industries in Nova Scotia, and Quebec
had sales totalling $350,000 in 1999.
The survey by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) is being done
partly as a precaution and also to ensure that the market is safe for
exports to resume to the United States. The virus has been detected on both
sides of the border, but both countries have slapped importation bans on
the other's stone fruit tree material. The CFIA has taken 20 000 leaf
samples for analysis in laboratories at Nepean, ON, Charlottetown, PEI, and
Sidney, BC.

[The probability of detecting the virus outside of the Niagara region at
this time is low, but it will be very interesting to know if the virus is
present elsewhere in Canada. Plum pox potyvirus was initially detected in
nectarine trees imported to the Niagara region from a nursery in
Pennsylvania two years ago, but subsequent tests of trees in that nursery
by American scientists failed to detect the virus. -Mod.DH
