Four mass food poisoning cases reported at Taipei schools and universities last week were confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as likely to be _Bacillus cereus_ contamination. Nearly 500 students from Affiliated Experimental Elementary School of National Chengchi University, Taipei Municipal Minghu Junior High School, Tianmu Elementary School, and Long Men Junior High School reportedly had diarrhea on Fri 13 Jan 2017.

The Department of Health said lunches provided to the 4 institutions were supplied by the same catering service, which has been ordered to stop supplying lunches while health officials investigate the cause of the outbreak. The department said that 97 percent of cases of diarrhea reported in recent weeks were caused by norovirus infection, and increasing numbers of norovirus infections have been reported in neighboring nations, which led the CDC to suspect that the outbreak might have also been norovirus. However, preliminary examinations of 42 specimens collected from 11 chefs and 7 teachers and students showed that none of them were infected with norovirus or rotavirus, but the stool samples of 3 chefs were found to have _Bacillus cereus_, a type of foodborne pathogenic bacterium.

CDC deputy director-general Philip Li said the centers and the city health department have also conducted a questionnaire on the campuses and concluded that norovirus was unlikely, because most people had mild diarrhea with a rapid recovery, while few had vomiting or fever. More tests are needed to confirm the cause of the outbreak, he said.

The Food and Drug Administration said _Bacillus cereus_ can be transmitted to food through dust, soil particles or insects, and contaminated food will usually not deteriorate or rot, but the bacterium can grow and produce toxins when food is exposed at room temperature (about 20 C [68 F]) for too long and cause food poisoning.

[_Bacillus cereus_ food poisoning is the general name used for the illness. However, the organism has 2 recognized types of foodborne illness: diarrheal and emetic. The emetic syndrome is caused by cereulide, a heat- and pH-stable peptide toxin. Consumption of food contaminated with this toxin may lead to emesis (vomiting) between 0.5 and 5 hours after ingestion. The symptoms of this illness mimic those of _Staphylococcus aureus_ food poisoning.

The diarrheal illness (more common in North America and Europe) is caused by a high molecular weight protein, while the emetic or vomiting type (commoner in Japan than the diarrheal type) of food poisoning is caused by a low molecular weight and heat-stable protein. In some outbreaks, there seems to be an overlap between the diarrheal and the emetic types of illness.

The symptoms of _B. cereus_ diarrheal type food poisoning include abdominal pain, watery diarrhea, rectal tenesmus (a feeling of constantly needing to pass stools despite an empty colon), moderate nausea that may accompany diarrhea, seldom vomiting, and no fever. Symptoms develop within 6-15 hours and can persist for 24 hours. This syndrome is rather mild and tends to mimic the symptoms of _Clostridium perfringens_ food poisoning. The diarrheal syndrome is caused by enterotoxins that are produced during growth of _B. cereus_ in the small intestine.

Generally, symptoms are transient and mild, possibly contributing to underreporting. Large numbers of cells are needed to cause illness and can occur when the food product (often rice) is held at a temperature inadequate to prevent growth. Despite the illness's usually mild symptoms, fatalities have been described associated with liver failure (Mahler H, Pasi A, Kramer JK, et al: Fulminant liver failure in association with the emetic toxin of _Bacillus cereus_. N Engl J Med 1997; 336(16): 1142-8; available at http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199704173361604.) - Mod.LL
