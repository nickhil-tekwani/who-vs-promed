A 49 year old woman from Veraguas province, in the interior of the Republic, died after having been affected by a hantavirus infection. The woman lived in Trinchera de Veraguas and she died in the Luis "Chicho" Fabrega Hospital [near the provincial capital of Santiago].

[Hantavirus infection] is a zoonoses transmitted by rodents to humans, similar to leptospirosis, but in this case it is a virus, not a bacterium.

Hantavirus infections are less frequent than leptospirosis, but can be more serious. There is no specific treatment available for either so both diseases are prevented by avoiding contact with mice.

[Although the hantavirus involved in this case is not specified, the one most likely responsible for this death is Choclo virus. As mentioned in ProMED-mail archive number 20081027.3389, hantaviruses (and their rodent hosts) recognized in Panama include Rio Segundo (_Reithrodontomys mexicanus_), Choclo (_Oligoryzomys fulvescens (costaricensis)_), and Calabazo (_Zygodontomys brevicauda (cherriei)_). Of these 3 viruses, only Choclo is a known human pathogen, causing hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which can have a high case fatality rate, especially when victims come to hospital late in the course of their disease.

ProMED-mail would appreciate receiving confirmation of the etiological agent as a hantavirus if laboratory tests are being done at the Gorgas Memorial Laboratory in Panama City.
