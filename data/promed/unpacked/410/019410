A recent post on ProMED-mail concerning the occurrence of African Swine Fever
in Namibia contained statements by the moderator about which I wish to
comment. First, transmission from the sylvatic cycle (which involves
warthogs, bushpigs and _Ornithodoros_ ticks) to domestic pigs may often be
due to argasid ticks of the genus Ornithodoros. However, during an epizootic
of ASF transmission readily occurs by pig to pig contact. Which mechanism is
the "usual mode of spread" is far from clear based on the literature.
Second, the ability of _Haematopinus suis_ to transmit ASF is questionable,
a best. A single report has claimed transmission after a 40 day incubation,
but two additional reports failed to demonstrate transmission (for an
excellent review, see Plowright, W.,G. R. Thomson, and J. A. Neser. 1994.
African swine fever, p. 568-599. In J. A. W. Coetzer, G. R. Thomson and R.
C. Tustin (ed.), Infectious Diseases of Livestock with Special Reference to
Southern Africa. Cape Town, New York, Oxford University Press). This is in
contrast to a large number of reports demonstrating ASF transmission to pigs
by _Ornithodoros spp._ ticks.
