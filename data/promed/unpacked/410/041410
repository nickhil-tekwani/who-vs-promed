Case of tularemia registered in Volinsk city
------------------------------------------------
On 1 Aug 2003, a 12-year-old girl was admitted to Lubotin Hospital in the
City of Volinsk with a diagnosis of tularemia. According to preliminary
information, she was infected after swimming in the local pond. Town
authorities responsible for sanitation and epidemiologic surveillance are
taking measures to prevent an epidemic.

According to the Emergency Situations Ministry of Ukraine, 1000 people have
already been vaccinated against tularemia, and an investigation of this
case is underway. The situation is under the control of the Emergency
Response Department of the City of Volinsk.

[We await further information about this case, especially regarding how the
diagnosis was made and the form of tularemia that the adolescent acquired
(i.e., ulceroglandular, oculoglandular, typhoidal, or pneumonic). Although
classically transmitted to man via infected animals such as rabbits or a
tick vector, infection with _Francisella tularensis_ may be acquired from
contact with soil or water harboring the bacterium. Although tularemia
pneumonia is the form of the disease associated with biological terrorism,
it may also occur naturally, as is exemplified by the sporadic case
described in New York City and the outbreak among gardeners on Martha's
Vineyard, both cited in past ProMED postings below.

Regarding water-related outbreaks of tularemia, outbreaks include 64 cases
in Dagestan, Russia associated with a flood-plain swamp (1), 49 cases in
Tuscany, Italy linked to an unchlorinated water system (2), and an outbreak
in the Smolensk province of Russia also attributed to contamination of a
water supply (3).

At present, no licensed tularemia vaccine is available in the USA. However,
the LVS vaccine (live vaccine strain) is available to military personnel
under an investigational new drug protocol held by the US Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (4). It is administered via
scarification using multiple punctures of a bifurcated needle. LVS is
derived from strain 15 developed in the former USSR and was obtained by the
US military in 1956 (5). It is not well standardized and contains 2
phenotypes of _F. tularensis_, only one of which seems immunogenic
(6). However, in studies published in 1977, the vaccine was shown to
significantly reduce the incidence of typhoidal tularemia in US government
lab workers from 5.7 to 0.27 cases per at-risk employee years (7). It did
not reduce the incidence of the ulceroglandular form, but the disease in
vaccinees was reported to be milder. I am not aware whether the vaccine is
effective if given postexposure.

[In the ProMED-mail posting Tularemia, human, aquatic source? - Spain
(Cuenca )(02) 19980923.1904 , there is a discussion of water-borne
transmission of tularemia with mention that during the period 1936 to 1963,
there were approximately 30 outbreaks of water-borne tularemia reported
from the then Soviet Union (Pollitzer, R. History and incidence of
tularemia in Soviet Union -- a review. Institute for Contemporary Russian
Studies, Fordham University, Bronx, New York, 1967). - Mod.MPP]
