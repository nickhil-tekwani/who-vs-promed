A Colorado company is recalling about 66 000 pounds [approx 30 tons]
of ground and tenderized steak bison meat that may be contaminated
with a potentially deadly strain of _E. coli_, according to the US
Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS).

A total of 5 cases of _E. coli_ O157:H7 illnesses in Colorado from 4
to 9 Jun 2010 are believed to be associated with the products,
officials said Friday, 2 Jul 2010. [There is also a case reported in
New York.] The meat was distributed to retail establishments
nationwide and to food service distributors in Utah and Arizona. The
products, produced between 21 and 27 May 2010, are being recalled by
Rocky Mountain Natural Meats of Henderson, Colorado.

Although the sell-by dates on the products have passed, the FSIS said
some consumers might have frozen the meat before using it, "and there
is concern that some product may still be frozen and in consumers'
freezers."

The recalled products include:
- 16-ounce packages of Great Range All Natural Ground Bison with a
sell- or freeze-by date of 21, 22, or 24 Jun 2010.
- 16-ounce packages of Nature's Rancher Ground Buffalo with a sell-
or freeze-by date of 22 Jun 2010.
- 16-ounce packages of The Buffalo Guys All Natural Ground Buffalo 90
Percent Lean with a lot number of 0147.
- 12-ounce packages of Great Range Brand All Natural Bison Steak
Medallions with a sell- or freeze-by date of 23 and 24 Jun 2010.
- 12-ounce packages of Great Range Brand All Natural Bison Sirloin
Steaks with a sell- or freeze-by date of 20, 23, and 24 Jun 2010.
- 15-pound boxes of Rocky Mountain Natural Meats Inc. Bison 10 oz.
Sirloin Steaks, which went to restaurants and bear a Julian Code of
0141.

[It has not been clearly stated as yet that the outbreak strain has
been isolated from the implicated vehicle.

Although the meat usually associated with _E. coli_ O157 is from
cattle, the following (extracted from
<http://www.vetmed.wisc.edu/pbs/zoonoses/O157DT104/O157DT104index.html>)
discusses some other animals that have been linked as well:
Deer: _E. coli_ O157 has been isolated from deer, suggesting a
possible wildlife source for infection. In one case, the organisms
isolated from 2 deer and 5 cattle on a ranch in Texas had identical
PFGE (pulsed field gel electrophoresis) patterns. In addition,
infection has been associated with consumption of venison/jerky. Deer
have been experimentally infected and shown to intermittently shed
the organism as in cattle.
Pigs: Toxin-producing _E. coli_ have been isolated from pigs. The
porcine "edema disease" variant of shiga-like toxin, SLT-IIe, was
originally thought to be distinct from the toxins causing HUS
(hemolytic uremic syndrome) in humans, but recent cases of HUS have
been associated with swine isolates. In addition, a survey of pigs in
Japan revealed about the same level of infection with O157:H7 in pigs
as in the cattle population, and the presence of O157:H7 in the
American swine population has also been demonstrated recently.
Finally, it also appears that O157:H7 strains can also persist in the
intestinal tract of pigs, as well as cattle.
Dogs: The O157:H7 strain has been isolated from 2 asymptomatic dogs
on a farm in Washington (along with cattle, a horse, 2 batches of
stable flies, and biofilms on water troughs on the farm). There have
been reports of dog-to-human transmission in Canada and the UK, and a
report of O157 isolation from a veterinary student's dog. A group of
greyhounds at a track in Alabama are reported to have been stricken
with HUS-like disease. Racing dogs are commonly fed raw beef, and _E.
coli_ O157:H7 was isolated from beef from "4D" (diseased,
debilitated, down, dying) cattle fed to the dogs. Greyhounds may be
an important research model for HUS.
Horses: There is a report of infection of a farmer with O157 after
tending to a sick horse, from which an identical O157 isolate was
obtained.

CIDRAP (Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy) reports that
"the recall is the 2nd involving ground bison in 3 years. In July
2007, Custom Pack, Inc., based in Hastings, Neb., recalled 5920
pounds (2.7 tons) of its ground meat products, which included ground
buffalo patties, because of possible _E. coli_ O157:H7 contamination.
The recall was prompted by sampling done by the Nebraska Department
of Health Services as part of an investigation into a reported
illness
(<http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/fs/food-disease/news/jul0610bison.html>
).

A 2004 study by researchers from North Dakota State University on the
prevalence of foodborne pathogens on bison carcasses at a Midwestern
processing facility found that antimicrobial strategies in use at the
time in the plant were relatively effective in reducing _Listeria_
and _E. coli_ contamination on bison carcasses, but more study was
needed to gauge the effect of slaughter practices on carcass
contamination. Levels of _E. coli_ on pre-hiding bison carcasses was
about 88 percent, but was 11.3 percent on chilled carcasses. They
concluded that while bison meat may not be a significant source of
foodborne pathogens seen in other meat industries, new interventions
should be developed to ensure the overall safety of the product."

It should also be noted that steak itself as opposed to ground beef
has been linked to O157 secondary to tenderized injections brings the
pathogen internal to the surface where it is less likely to be killed
by lesser degrees of cooking. - Mod.LL]
