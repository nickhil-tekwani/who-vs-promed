Hormone scare hurts Europe farmers, feed makers
-------------------------------------------------
HAMBURG: European Union farmers endured tough restrictions on Wednesday, as
officials traced animal feed tainted with a banned hormone, and feed makers
demanded new laws to keep harmful waste out of their products. Some light
appeared at the end of the tunnel for livestock farmers as the Netherlands,
the world's third largest pig exporter, lifted a blanket ban on foreign
sales, subject to stringent safeguards.
And in Belgium, the food chain security body, AFSCA, said all pigs, cattle
and milk tested so far for traces of the hormone in the Netherlands,
Belgium and Luxembourg were clean. "All the tests so far carried out by
AFSCA on animal products are favourable", it said in a statement.
But farmers' representatives warned that farms could face bankruptcy if
such checks for animal feed contaminated with medroxyprogesterone-acetate
(MPA) took too long. "Farmers have to pay to feed their animals but cannot
earn any money by selling them," said Guenther-Martin Beine, spokesman for
north German farmers' association LNL. "If tests take more than a couple of
weeks, some farms will have to close."
Farms in most of the 15 member countries of the EU have been hit and
closures (pending checks for the hormone) have in some cases been in force
since late last week.
Ingredients made by the now-bankrupt Belgian firm Bioland and tainted with
MPA were mixed in feed sent to about half the pig farmers in the
Netherlands, some 7000 farms. MPA is forbidden in the EU and in other
countries as a hormone in livestock feed and scientists say it can cause
infertility in humans. It is a component in pharmaceuticals such as hormone
replacement therapies for women in menopause.
The EU's animal feed industry called for better laws. "It is unacceptable
that animal feed is still regarded as a cheap waste disposal system,"
Fefac, the European Compound Feed Manufacturers Federation, grouping
organisations from 14 EU member states, said in a statement. "Fefac
therefore calls on the European institutions to propose most rapidly a
harmonised regulation for animal feed hygiene aimed at extending compulsory
official approval to all feed material suppliers and to ensure that the
regulation on dangerous waste be correctly implemented," it said.
The Dutch farm ministry said late on Wednesday that farmers could resume
exports, but only following examination of meat from a "test slaughter"
and, in some cases, if they could prove the animals had eaten fresh food
for the past 7 days. Approval for exports had been widely expected after
Dutch authorities and EU veterinarians on Wednesday discussed a protocol
with conditions for exports and slaughter to restart.
The latest in a series of food scares in Europe provoked anger among
farmers whose livelihood was again affected.
"We are sick of being the victims of yet another case of feed
contamination," Beine said. "People are now thinking about joining together
to take legal action against those responsible."
The source of MPA contamination has been traced to waste water from an
Irish pharmaceutical factory owned by U.S. drugmaker Wyeth, Irish officials
have said. The waste was shipped via Irish waste recovery company Cara
Environmental Technology Ltd to Belgian reprocessing plant Bioland, which
mixed it into glucose syrup then sold as raw material to Dutch animal feed
makers. Cara has said there were no grounds for action against it.
Ireland's Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday alleged "serious
errors" at Wyeth's Irish plant. They said waste water containing the
hormone had been wrongly labelled before being shipped to the Belgian
reprocessing plant.
A spokesman for Wyeth Medica Ireland told Reuters on Wednesday: "Before we
sent them the waste we provided them (Cara and Bioland) with samples,
safety data sheets and all of the constituents of the products and they
confirmed to us they were capable of handling the waste."
Asked if the company expected the waste to end up in glucose for animal
feed he said "certainly not. It was confirmed to us it would be processed
in the correct manner." He declined to comment on reports that European
farmers plan to sue the company for damages and stressed the firm was fully
cooperating with authorities in Ireland and continental Europe.
Officials stress there is no immediate danger to health unless MPA is
consumed over long periods, but any animals testing positive may not be sold.

Information on presence of MPA in feed
---------------------------------------
[Included in "Outcome of the Agriculture Council, 15 July 2002"]:
On the request of the Dutch delegation the Netherlands, Belgium, Ireland
and Germany gave a brief report on the situation. Commissioner David Byrne
said: "Unfortunately, we again have to deal with an incident which should
never have happened and which should have been avoided. I would like to
point out that the Commission takes this incident very seriously. It is
unacceptable that hormones should be present in feedingstuffs and
apparently also in soft drinks. In the framework of the Standing Committee,
it was indicated that the origin of the contamination lay in the fraudulent
exchange and disposal of pharmaceutical waste. Subsequent discussions in
this framework have been very useful in exchanging information and getting
to the root of the problem.
Feed and food operators need to be more aware of their responsibilities in
this area. Feed operators should ensure that the raw materials that they
buy are safe."
He called upon the Competent Authorities in the Member States to exercise
stricter control in ensuring a high level of protection of consumer health.
"I have asked Member States to continue their investigations in order to
trace potentially contaminated feed, to place under surveillance
establishments concerned and to test potentially affected animals, in order
to ensure that products placed on the market do not constitute a risk to
public health. In particular it is necessary to ensure that all
contaminated feedingstuffs are traced, withdrawn and safely disposed of.
All necessary steps are taken to protect public health. Member States
assure me that such steps are in fact taken.
Byrne also signalled forthcoming proposals of the Commission on controls
for food and feed and feed hygiene.

Hormone contaminated waste "incorrectly classified"
---------------------------------------------------
The hormone-contaminated waste shipped from Ireland, now at the centre of a
major food scare, was incorrectly classified, the Environment Protection
Agency has said.
In a preliminary report presented to EU animal food experts in Brussels
yesterday, the EPA accused both Wyeth Medica, Newbridge, Co Kildare, and
waste brokers, Cara Environmental Technology Ltd, of mixing hazardous and
non-hazardous waste for export.
As the crisis hit thousands of farms on the Continent, angry Dutch pig
farmers and feed makers threatened to sue the two Irish-based companies.
Half of all pig producers in the Netherlands, 7000 farms, have been put out
of business pending the investigation in all but 4 member-states into the
inclusion of medroxyprogestrone-acetate (MPA) in animal food, which can
affect fertility in humans. The EU Commission for Consumer Affairs advised
that the amount of contamination involved is unlikely to be harmful, but
one German state has urged consumers not to eat meat.
The EPA report, which has been seen by The Irish Times, said non-hazardous
sugar waste from Wyeth was correctly classified and notified to Irish and
international authorities in 1997-99.
"However, in November 1999, following an audit by personnel from the Wyeth
and Cara companies of a treatment company, Bioland in Belgium, the
non-active, non-hazardous waste sugar stream was rerouted to Bioland,
classified as green waste (incorrectly), not requiring notification under
the Trans-Frontier Shipment Regulations requirements and shipped for recovery.
"In July 2000, Cara Environmental sent a trial sample of waste sugar
solution containing MPA to Bioland. The agency did not find documentary
evidence of acceptance of this waste by Bioland, although Cara
Environmental reported a verbal acceptance.
"It appears that from this time on, the 2 waste streams, hazardous and
non-hazardous, were sent as combined shipments and dispatched to Bioland by
Cara Environmental under the green-list classification."
The report added that no notification was made by Wyeth of this change in
procedure or request for permission to send the sugar solution containing
the MPA to Bioland for recovery. This breached the terms of the integrated
pollution control licence granted to Wyeth by the EPA in 1996. It concluded
that the decision to classify the sugar solution containing MPA as "green
waste" was incorrect; and its reclassification led to the waste being
exported without notification to the competent authorities in Ireland or in
Belgium.
Newbridge-based Wyeth said last night it understood the EPA was considering
citing the company in relation to not notifying the agency of a change of
waste processor for the treatment of the waste stream in question. It
pledged to co-operate.
The managing director of Cara Environmental, Mr Brendan Keane, said it had
proof that it had sent samples of the waste from Wyeth to Bioland on 28 Jul
2000, and the decision to classify the material as "green" was made on
those results. "Why would we risk our reputation to dispose of 200 tonnes
of waste like this?"

[Reuters update of 18 Jul 2002 says: "The number of German farms banned
from selling their meat and milk, after receiving animal feed tainted with
a banned hormone, has now risen to around 2100 from 300, German authorities
said on Thursday." It seems that this multi-routed food scare is gaining
pace, with a lot at stake. Again - food (water) for thought. - Mod.AS]
