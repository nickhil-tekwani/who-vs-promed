Three additional early-season isolates of influenza A virus have been
recorded in the Province of Quebec. These cases are non-Canadian [in
non-Canadians?] and had recently been on a North American cruise ship where
some other passengers had reported upper respiratory tract infection. Most
of the
passengers were residents of countries other than Canada. These isolates
are currently under investigation to further characterize the strain. This
is the second instance of influenza A virus isolation in Quebec in the
1997/98 flu season.
