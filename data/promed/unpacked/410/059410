[Another EpiCore member mentioned that the wild polioviruses that were detected in Quetta and Pishin were not genetically related to viruses known to be circulating in Jacobabad (Sindh province) and Afghanistan's Kandahar province.

We'd like to thank the EpiCore Surveillance Project members for their very helpful contributions to our knowledge base on the poliovirus situation in Pakistan and apologize again for the delay in posting these results.
