A female elephant, aged about 35, was found dead in Bhalubasa area of Kuldiha Reserve Forest in Balasore district [Odisha state]. Sources said the elephant died nearly a fortnight ago and the death came to light when some locals, who had seen it sick, found the ashes. They claimed that the forest officials allegedly burnt the body claiming that the elephant died of anthrax.

Divisional Forest Officer (DFO) Harsabardhan Udgata on [Tue 1 Dec 2015] admitted that the elephant was cremated inside the forest as it had died of anthrax. He also said that another tusker is ill for nearly a week and is suspected to be suffering from diarrhoea. "The tusker (20) was found moving in Gohirabhol and it seems to be recovering as it was seen raiding a banana orchard on [Tue 1 Dec 2015]. We are monitoring its movement," he added.

"The viscera test conducted by the Animal Diseases Research Institute (ADRI) at Cuttack [Odisha] confirmed presence of _Bacillus anthracis_, the anthrax organism in the female elephant," the DFO added.

[For a map of India showing Odisha go to http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/india/india-political-map.htm. Balasore district is in northeastern Odisha; see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balasore and the Kuldiha Reserve Forest is to its ESE; see http://wikimapia.org/12528898/Kuldiha-Wildlife-Sanctuary-Nilgiri.

This reserve is connected with the Simlipal Tiger Reserve where an elephant was reported dead from anthrax in early August 2015 (see archive no 20150804.3556122) and where some 7 elephants have been reported with this disease in the past 2 years. According to the "Wildlife Conservation in Odisha" description of the Kuldiha Sanctuary, "The sanctuary is linked with Similipal through Sukhupada hills and Nato hill ranges." (http://odishawildlife.org/protectedarea.html). Therefore, I think we might assume that this latest elephant case could be related to those in Similpal. A DNA check could confirm this. - Mod.MHJ
