1st report of beet pseudo-yellows virus (BPYV) on _Cucurbita
moschata_ and _C. pepo_ in Costa Rica
-----------------------------------------------
RW Hammond, USDA-ARS, Beltsville, MD 20705; E Hernandez, F
Mora, P Ramirez, Universidad de Costa Rica, San Jose, Costa
Rica. Plant Dis 2005; 89: 1130, published online as DOI:
10.1094/PD-89-1130B. Accepted for publication 19 Jul 2005.
In early 2004, severe yellowing and chlorosis were observed
in field-grown cucurbits in Costa Rica. Symptoms resembled
those of the genus _Crinivirus_ (family _Closteroviridae_),
and large populations of whiteflies were observed in the
fields and on symptomatic plants. Although the identity of
the whiteflies on the curcurbits was not determined, the
greenhouse whitefly, (Westwood) is known to be present in
the region from where the samples were obtained.
To identify the causal agent of the disease, leaf samples of
symptomatic plants were collected from several farms. The
leaf samples were dried with silica gel. Total RNA was
extracted from leaf tissue of 8 representative samples (2
from healthy plants and 6 from symptomatic plants) using TRI
Reagent (Molecular Research Inc, Cincinnati, OH). Reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) containing
one primer set at a time were performed using the Titan
One-Tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Diagnostics Corp, Chicago IL) and
primers specific for genes of cucurbit-infecting
criniviruses, including the coat protein gene of Cucurbit
yellow stunting disorder virus (3) and the minor coat
protein gene (CPm) of Beet pseudo-yellows virus (BPYV) (4).
Primers specific for the heat shock protein (HSP) gene
(CYHSPF 5' gagcgccgcacaagtcatc 3' and CYHSPR 5'
taccgccaccaaagtcatacatta 3') of Cucumber yellows virus (CYV,
a strain of BPYV) (1) were designed based on published
sequence data. In addition, primers specific for cucurbit
aphid-borne yellows virus (2) and melon yellowing-associated
flexivirus (MYVF 5' GGCTGGCAACATGGAAACTGA 3' and MYVR 5'
CTGAAAAGGCGATGAACTATTGTG 3') were used in RT-PCR reactions.
Amplified DNA fragments of 333 and 452 bp were obtained in
each of 2 samples obtained from symptomatic plants and only
in separate reactions containing BPYV and CYV primer sets,
respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis of all purified
PCR products verified their identity as variants of BPYV,
with 97 and 99 per cent sequence identity with reported CPm
and HSP sequences, respectively. The 2 samples from
_Cucurbita moschata_ Duch. (ayote or squash) and _Cucurbita
pepo_ L. (escalopini or sunburst squash) were taken from a
region around Paraiso, Cartago, Costa Rica.
To our knowledge, this is the 1st report of BPYV in Costa
Rica. The economic impact on cucurbit production has not yet
been determined. Studies are under way to determine the
prevalence and genetic variability of BPYV isolates in Costa
Rica.

[BPYV was discovered in 1965 in California and was the 1st
crinivirus reported in the literature. It is transmitted by
the greenhouse whitefly (GHWF) (taxonomically, _Trialeurodes
vaporariorum_ [Tv]), which has since been identified in
production greenhouses throughout the world. The only known
vector is the GHWF, which is often a chronic problem. BPYV
has an exceptionally large natural host range among crop and
weed species, infecting plants in at least 12 different
taxonomic families, particularly for BPYV and to a lesser
degree, for Tomato infectious chlorosis (TICV) and Tomato
chlorosis virus (ToCV). Typical BPYV symptoms vary among
hosts, expressing severe yellowing, reduced fruit size and
possibly early senescence in cucumber and pumpkin.
Greenhouse-grown cucumbers and melons are often infected
with BPYV, which is facilitated by the accumulation of GHWF
in closed environments. Some nurseries employ virus indexing
programs and methods for eradicating viruses through tissue
culture techniques. Application of these methods to
GHWF-transmitted criniviruses, coupled with effective vector
control, will reduce spread of these viruses as well as
limit damage to susceptible crops both in greenhouse and
field environments.
There is little information on the availability of
resistance to GHWF-transmitted criniviruses in any of the
predominantly affected crops. Although a source of BPYV
resistance has been identified in melon, this source has not
been advanced into commercial cultivars. Ongoing research is
examining wild tomato germplasm for sources of resistance to
TICV, but no sources of resistance have been identified to
date.
Currently, the most effective method for control of
criniviruses is an effective insecticide-based control
program. Imidocloprid-based products are most frequently
used for whitefly control, and can be applied as a foliar
spray, a seed treatment or through drip application. While
insecticides effectively reduce whitefly populations, they
are inefficient for control of viruses, since whiteflies can
transmit a virus before being killed by an insecticide. Most
GHWF-transmitted criniviruses do not produce symptoms until
3 to 4 weeks after infection occurs, by which time it may be
too late for implementation of control measures.
