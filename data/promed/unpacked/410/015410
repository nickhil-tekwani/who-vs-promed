_Salmonella java_ phage type Dundee - rise in cases
Thirteen cases of _Salmonella java_ phage type Dundee infection in England
and Wales have been identified by the PHLS Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens
(LEP) since 21 December 1998, six of them in February 1999. This compares
with nine cases throughout 1998 and nine in 1997. Some of the infections
have been serious: at least seven patients have been admitted to hospital
and in four cases the organism has been isolated from blood. Most of the
cases identified so far are from London and one case lives in Luton, which
is some 30 miles north of London. Another case, who lives in Leicester (a
city in the Midlands), may have acquired the infection in London. Twelve of
the cases have Asian names, and some are known to be vegetarian. None had
recently travelled abroad. Six of the patients are adults, three are
teenagers, and four are children aged between 5 months and 4 years.
The infecting strain is susceptible to antimicrobial agents, including
ampicillin, chloramphenicol, trimethoprim, and ciprofloxacin. _S. java_ is
a group B salmonella and has the same antigenic structure as S. paratyphi B
(O = 4, 12: H = b : 1.2). _S. java_ and _S. paratyphi_ B are differentiated
by the dextro-tartrate test, in which _S. java_ produces a positive acid
reaction, whereas _S. paratyphi_ B is negative. The fact that several
patients developed bacteraemia suggests that the organisms are behaving
more like _S. paratyphi_ B, which routinely causes enteric fever, rather
than _S. java_, which is more commonly associated with gastroenteritis.
The PHLS Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) is investigating
the contact details of the individual cases and asking them about food
exposures. An enquiry is being made to Enter-net (the international
surveillance network for enteric pathogens), which will ask whether cases
are also occurring in other countries and whether any foodstuffs have been
identified recently that may help in the investigation of this outbreak.
