["Brucellosis is the generic name used for the animal and human infections caused by several species of the genus Brucella, mainly _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_. Infection with Brucella in cattle is usually caused by _B. abortus_, less frequently by _B. melitensis_, and occasionally by _B. suis_. _Brucella melitensis_ is the main causative agent of infection with Brucella in sheep and goats. Infection with Brucella in pigs is due to _B. suis_ biovars 1-3, but the disease caused by biovar 2 differs in its host range, its limited geographical distribution and its pathogenicity. In some areas, _B. suis_ infection has become established in wild pigs. Clinically, infection with Brucella in animals is characterized by one or more of the following signs: abortion, retained placenta, orchitis, epididymitis and, rarely, arthritis, with excretion of the organisms in uterine discharges and in milk. Unequivocal diagnosis depends on the isolation of Brucella from abortion material, udder secretions or from tissues removed at post-mortem. _Brucella abortus_, _B. melitensis_ and _B. suis_ are highly pathogenic for humans, and potentially contaminated tissues, cultures and materials must be handled under appropriate containment conditions.

"Infection with Brucella in sheep and goats (excluding _B. ovis_ infection) is primarily caused by one of the 3 biovars of _B. melitensis_. Sporadic infections caused by _B. abortus_ or _B. suis_ have been observed in sheep and goats, but such cases are extremely rare. Infection with Brucella in sheep and goats is endemic in the Mediterranean region, but infection is widespread world-wide. North America (except Mexico) is believed to be free from the agent, as are northern and central Europe, south-east Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Pathologically and epidemiologically, _ B. melitensis_ infection in sheep and goats is very similar to _B. abortus_ infection in cattle. In most circumstances, the primary routes of transmission of Brucella are the placenta, fetal fluids and vaginal discharges expelled by infected ewes and goats when they abort or have full-term parturition. Shedding of Brucella is also common in udder secretions and semen, and Brucella may be isolated from various tissues, such as lymph nodes from the head, spleen and organs associated with reproduction (uterus, epididymides and testes), and from arthritic lesions".

"Brucella infection is readily transmissible to humans, causing acute febrile illness - undulant fever - which may progress to a more chronic form and can also produce serious complications affecting the musculo-skeletal, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems. Precautions should be taken to prevent human infection. Infection is essentially acquired by the oral, respiratory, or conjunctival routes, but ingestion of raw milk products constitutes the main risk to the general public where the disease is endemic. There is an occupational risk to veterinarians, abattoir workers and farmers who handle infected animals/carcasses and aborted fetuses or placentas. Brucellosis is also one of the most easily acquired laboratory infections, and all laboratory manipulations with live cultures or potentially infected/contaminated material must be performed at an appropriate biosafety and containment level determined by bio-risk analysis".
