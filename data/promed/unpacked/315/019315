Trading, transportation, and processing of cocoa pods and other planting material across parish borders has been suspended with immediate effect, an emergency strategy aimed at curtailing the spread of the deadly frosty pod disease.

Clarendon is the worst-affected parish, the crop is almost entirely infected. St Mary is also badly affected, with Portland and St Thomas the only places where the disease has not yet been detected. The fungus now threatens to wipe out cocoa cultivation. "The disease has spread tremendously," Karl Samuda, minister of industry, commerce, agriculture and fisheries, [said].

After islandwide survey experts determined that more aggressive action was absolutely necessary, paving the way for the Cocoa Frosty Pod Order of 2017. "The public is not allowed to move [cocoa plant material] and go into a cocoa field. It's against the law, there will be penalties. We have to literally start over again. Those are the harsh realities."

[Frosty pod rot (FPR; also called moniliasis) of cocoa is caused by the fungus _Moniliophthora roreri_. It is an invasive disease which was originally identified in Ecuador in 1917 and spread rapidly to other countries in Latin America during the 1970s. It can cause complete loss of production and is considered a major constraint to cocoa production in the region. FPR reached the northern boundary of the crop with its 1st detection in Mexico in 2006. FPR was only recently detected for the 1st time outside of Latin America, in Jamaica's Clarendon parish (ProMED-mail post 20161004.4534271).

FPR-affected pods show large brown lesions on the outside, but these may appear less serious than the associated bean loss inside the pods. Mummies (shrivelled pods) and internal necrosis are also common. The fungus produces large quantities of powdery spores giving affected pods a frosted appearance. It is a specialised pathogen that invades only actively growing pods of cocoa and related species of _Theobroma_ and _Herrania_, which may serve as pathogen reservoirs. Conventional control measures, including phytosanitation, have failed to halt the progress of FPR. Integrated management strategies suited to smallholders and collaborative resistance breeding programmes are being developed.

The related fungus _M. perniciosa_ causes witches' broom (WB) of cocoa and is spreading in the same region. It has ravaged production in parts of Brazil and led to abandonment of cocoa cultivation in many areas. Both pathogens also pose a potential threat to cocoa growing areas in Africa and Asia if they are introduced there.
