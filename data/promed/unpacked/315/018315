The inexpensive antidepressant fluvoxamine reduced the need for a long emergency department (ED) observation or a hospital stay among high-risk, symptomatic COVID-19 outpatients treated within 7 days of symptom onset as much as 30% to 65%, finds a Brazilian platform clinical trial yesterday [27 Oct 2021] in The Lancet Global Health (https://bit.ly/3GFBu0S).

In the largest such trial to date, a team led by researchers in Brazil, the USA, and Canada randomly assigned 1497 adult COVID-19 patients, most of them unvaccinated, in 11 cities to either 100 milligrams of fluvoxamine twice daily for 10 days or a placebo from 20 Jan to 5 Aug 2021. Average patient age was 50 years, 58% were female, 95% were of mixed race, and all had at least one predisposing medical condition. Patients were followed for 28 days.

The study was part of the ongoing TOGETHER trial, which has evaluated 8 possible COVID-19 treatments (e.g., lopinavir-ritonavir, metformin). The fluvoxamine arm was stopped early because preliminary results showed that it was more effective than placebo.

Fluvoxamine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used since the 1990s to treat mental illnesses such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and depression. Possible mechanisms of action in COVID-19 are its anti-inflammatory, antiplatelet, and possible antiviral properties. The cost of a 10-day course of fluvoxamine is about USD 4, regardless of world region.

Of the 741 patients receiving fluvoxamine, 79 (11%) were observed for more than 6 hours in an ED or transferred to a tertiary care hospital, compared with 119 of 756 (16%) in the placebo group (relative risk [RR], 0.68). Of both possible outcomes, 87% were hospitalizations. An intention-to-treat analysis showed a similar outcome (RR, 0.69), and a per-protocol analysis found a larger treatment effect (RR, 0.34). The probability of superiority of fluvoxamine relative to placebo was 99.8%, surpassing the study's superiority threshold of 97.6% (risk difference, 5.0%).

In the intention-to-treat analysis, 17 patients in the fluvoxamine group and 25 in the placebo group died (odds ratio [OR], 0.68). In the per-protocol analysis, one patient died in the fluvoxamine group, as did 12 in the placebo group (OR, 0.09), and there was a significant treatment effect among patients who reported higher than 80% treatment adherence (RR, 0.34 for hospitalization; OR, 0.09).

Differences in the number of adverse events possibly related to treatment were not significant among the 2 groups. Nor were there significant differences for viral clearance at day 7, COVID-19 hospitalization, time to hospitalization, length of hospital stay, death, time to death, length of time on mechanical ventilation, time to recovery, or scores on physical or mental scales.

In a news release from McMaster University in Ontario, senior author Edward Mills, PhD, a McMaster researcher, said of the drug, "It could be one of our most powerful weapons against the virus, and its effectiveness is one of the most important discoveries we have made since the pandemic began." He called it a "massive boon to public health" (https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/932847).

The study authors noted the dearth of effective COVID-19 treatments, which is particularly problematic in regions of the world with low access to coronavirus vaccines. "Identifying inexpensive, widely available, and effective therapies against COVID-19 is, therefore, of great importance," they wrote. "Given fluvoxamine's safety, tolerability, ease of use, low cost, and widespread availability, these findings might influence national and international guidelines on the clinical management of COVID-19."

The researchers said that it is unknown what absolute reduction in risk of clinical deterioration would motivate patients to choose fluvoxamine but speculated that it may be about 5.0%, as was observed in the trial. "These considerations raise the importance of the development of a validated prediction rule for deterioration in patients in the early stages of COVID-19 infection," they wrote.

In a commentary in the same journal, Otavio Berwanger, MD, PhD, of Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in Sao Paolo, said that questions remain as to the effectiveness and safety of fluvoxamine in terms of death and hospitalization rates and whether it has an additive effect on other COVID-19 therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies (https://bit.ly/2ZH5CIg). "Finally, it is still unclear whether the results from the TOGETHER trial extend to other outpatient populations with COVID-19, including those without risk factors for disease progression, those who are fully vaccinated, and those infected with the delta variant or other variants," he wrote.

As the world sees a surge in COVID-19 cases, Pakistan has been reporting the lowest positivity rates since the country started measuring the infection ratio in April last year [2020]. On the other hand, 13 patients lost their lives to the virus and 516 new cases surfaced in a single day.

Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, Asad Umar, who also heads the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), announced the development on social media.

"Alhamdulillah, we now have the lowest positivity ratio since we started measuring COVID-19. Also, have the lowest patients on critical care and lowest daily mortality in a year. The positive impact of vaccination is showing but the vaccination drive must continue. Globally 7500 died of COVID-19 yesterday [26 Oct 2021]," the minister tweeted.

The South Asian COVID-19 situation, according to data from Worldometer (https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) as of 29 Oct 2021 at 02:51 GMT:

Country: Total cases / Total deaths / Deaths per million population
India: 34 245 530 / 457 221 / 327
Bangladesh: 1 568 857 / 27 847 / 167
Pakistan: 1 271 027 / 28 414 / 125
Nepal: 811 407 / 11 382 / 382
Sri Lanka: 538 860 / 13 696 / 636
Afghanistan: 156 166 / 7268 / 181
Maldives: 87 487 / 243 / 439
Bhutan: 2621 / 3 / 4

Over the last 7 days, 102 294, 1950, 3634, 3885, and 5000 COVID-19 cases were detected in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and Sri Lanka, respectively, compared with 105 644, 2422, 4622, 3246, and 4105 in the preceding 7 days, revealing the continuation of the decreasing trend of the disease in the 3 most populous countries in South Asia -- India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. However, the total cases in Nepal and Sri Lanka have showed a slightly increasing trend. The daily case positivity is now just over 1% (1.25%) in India and around 1.5% in Bangladesh. The current case-positivity in Pakistan is reportedly the lowest since the rate reported in April 2020, as indicated in item [D] above.

As of 29 Oct 2021 at 08:00 IST (GMT+5:30) India has administered 1 048 200 966 doses of COVID-19 vaccine across the country (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/). India's COVID genomic surveillance project is on high alert after cases of a new delta variant (delta AY.4 variant) of SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Only time would say whether another peak of the disease can be seen in the near future due to its circulation which could be more transmissible than the original delta variant strain (https://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india/covid-19-new-delta-variant-ay-4-2-vui-21oct-01-detected-in-madhya-pradesh-maharashtra-covid-third-wave-india-742043).

Bangladesh has a plan for vaccinating 80% of the population above 18 years of age. So far, of the target population, 34.18% have received the 1st dose and 17.47% have received both the 1st and 2nd doses (http://103.247.238.92/webportal/pages/covid19-vaccination-update.php). The country has also decided to vaccinate school children under the age of 18, and a total of 112 students belonging to 4 government schools in Manikganj district in Dhaka division were reportedly vaccinated on 14 Oct 2021 with Pfizer jabs as part of a test run (https://m.theindependentbd.com/post/269067). From 1 Nov 2021, school students between 12 and 17 years of age in the country will be vaccinated against the disease with the same Pfizer vaccine, and around 40 000 students are expected to be vaccinated daily. (https://www.thedailystar.net/health/disease/coronavirus/fallouts-fightback/vaccine/news/students-aged-12-17-40000-get-jabs-day-2208816).

The trends of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths attributed to the disease in Pakistan can be seen at https://covid19.who.int/region/emro/country/pk. As of 29 Oct 2021 at 8:43 AM, a total of 103 514 198 doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered in the country (https://ncoc.gov.pk/).

So far, Nepal has administered at least 15 048 288 doses of COVID-19 vaccine (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/nepal/), and Sri Lanka has administered at least 28 413 012 doses of the vaccine. Assuming every person needs 2 doses, that number is enough to have vaccinated about 65.2% of the country's population (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/sri-lanka/). The country is also vaccinating 18- and 19-year-olds against the disease with the Pfizer vaccine (https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/sri-lanka-begins-vaccinating-18-19-age-group/article37001914.ece).
