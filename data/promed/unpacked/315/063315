I am not sure if indeed hepatitis B vaccination is being carried out. As
Prakash indicated, it is inappropriate and especially for Kiribati where
hepatitis B is endemic, it has been the prudent policy to concentrate on
vaccinating the newborns and those at risk (hospital workers like
laboratory staff and theatre staff) and I would be very surprised if that
has changed.

[Could one of our colleagues from the South Pacific Commission tell us (a)
what type of hepatitis this is, & (b) who is being vaccinated with what? -
