[Anthrax is sporadic in Italy. The previous outbreak in Campania occurred in 2011; was associated with coincident outbreaks in Basilicata, and had 6 bovine outbreaks and 10 cases, one equine outbreak with one case, and one ovine outbreak with one case. In 2009 there was one caprine outbreak, and a single bovine outbreak in 2002, one case. Though this outbreak was late in the year [30 Oct 2017], at this latitude it could still be from grazing a contaminated site, e.g., a cattle anthrax grave possibly of one of the animals that died of anthrax in 2011. While goats are normally browsers -- they eat foliage off bushes -- they do graze. Winter outbreaks are usually related to contaminated feed or hay. - Mod.MHJ]
