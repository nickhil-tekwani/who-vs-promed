South Africa Confirms Foot-And-Mouth Disease In NE
-----------------------------------------------
The South African government has confirmed foot-and-mouth disease
[FMD] in 11 cattle in the northeast of the country but says it
believes the cases can be brought under control quickly, the
Department of Agriculture said Tuesday [8 Aug 2006].
[However, since there is as yet no OIE notification, this must still be
treated as "suspected". - ProMED]
The disease, which can be fatal to livestock, was found after a total of 45
cattle were inspected, the department said in a statement.
"The authorities expect that the situation can be brought under
control rapidly without undue effects on the agricultural industry as
a whole," the department said. South Africa's big meat industry group
played down the news, saying the identified area has been hit before
by FMD cases and all were stopped from spreading.
"We have seen cases here before, but they are always contained," said
Manie Booysen, chief executive of the South African Meat Industry
Co., which brands itself as an umbrella group for the South African
meat industry.
The government said it had stepped up measures, such as restricting
animal movement and vaccinations, to prevent more cases, and said no
cloven-hoofed animals, or their products, would leave the area.
The identified area, next to Kruger National Park which lies adjacent
to the border with Mozambique, is a FMD buffer zone where all animals
must be vaccinated against the disease twice a year.
The disease can infect cattle, sheep, pigs, and goats. The department
said exports wouldn't be disrupted. "The detection of positive cases
in the buffer zone does not affect the status of South Africa's
"FMD-free zone without vaccination", as recognized by the International
Office of Epizootics [OIE], and thus does not affect the export status of
the country," the department said.
The Paris-based OIE is an organization with 167 member countries whose
mission, in part, is to disseminate information to countries about outbreaks
of animal diseases.
The Department of Agriculture said current evidence indicated the cases are
confined to "2 dipping tank areas."
FMD isn't normally fatal to adult animals but can hurt productivity,
as animals become lame, according to a description by the U.K.'s
Department for Environmental Food and Rural Affairs. Young animals
have a much higher chance of dying from the disease.

[South Africa's previous FMD outbreak was reported in 2004; it
occurred in Limpopo, caused by FMD virus serotype SAT 2.
Recently, neighboring Botswana reported an outbreak of FMD caused by
serotype SAT2. It occurred in Selibe Phikwe district (zone 7) (map

However, Botswana is not adjacent to the Kruger Park.
The exact location of the current outbreak and if confirmed, details on the
FMDV serotype involved, are anticipated. - Mod.AS]
