The Department Medical Virology, Tygerberg Hospital, National Health
Laboratory Service, South Africa, received a stool sample collected on 15
May 2006, referred from a private laboratory, from a 39-year-old farmer
from Aranos district, Eastern Namibia. The patient had been in Windhoek 2
weeks before for a cholecystectomy (admitted on 25 Apr for surgery on 27
Apr). He had not traveled outside Namibia in the last 2 months. Childhood
vaccination history could not be obtained.
He returned to Aranos over the weekend of 29/30 Apr, where he recovered
well. On 6 May he fell ill with rigors, shortness of breath and abdominal
pain, the day before he presented with paresis. A provisional diagnosis of
sepsis was made. As he also presented with paresis of both legs to the
extent that he could not walk; a stool specimen was sent for polio
diagnosis. He did not complain of any muscle pains but was severely ill. He
was referred to Windhoek where he was hospitalised and immediately needed
intubation and ventilation for respiratory failure; weakness of intercostal
muscles was noted.
Polio virus type 1 was isolated from the stool sample. The isolate and a
stool sample were referred to Dr. Lucille Blumberg, National Institute of
Communicable Disease (NICD), Sandrinham, Johannesburg, where virus from the
Tygerberg isolate was characterised as wild type. The stool sample is now
being cultured in order to confirm the isolation result. At this stage the
diagnosis should be seen as provisional, until it is confirmed on the
original specimen.
A few comments on probable epidemiological links between this case and the
current AFP outbreak in Windhoek: There is a temporal and geographic
relationship. The patient was hospitalised in Windhoek 2 weeks before
paresis set in. The Nossob River that drains an area next to Windhoek flows
past Aranos but it largely remains submerged in the Khalagadi sand except
during the rare flood; although Aranos makes use of borehole water it seems
a very unlikely source of infection, due to the distance from Windhoek.
It is possible that abdominal surgery adversely affected the degree of
paralysis in this case, since it has been reported that tonsillectomy is
associated with bulbar paralysis in children prior to symptomatic polio or
injection in a limb prior to illness is associated with severe paralysis in
the same limb.

A suspected polio outbreak has killed 7 people in Namibia since early May
[2006], spurring the southern African nation to launch a mass vaccination
programme, officials said on Tuesday [6 Jun 2006].
Senior Health Department officials said preliminary tests indicated the
outbreak -- which mystified doctors for several weeks -- was polio.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) is engaged in a global campaign to wipe
out the disease.
"Preliminary results indicate a Polio Virus 1 (PV1) Wild Type," Kalumbi
Shangula, permanent secretary for the Ministry of Health and Social
Services, told reporters. Specimens collected from 11 patients were sent to
South African laboratories for investigation last week, and Shangula said 5
of 11 specimens were identified as polio. Final confirmation was expected
later this week.
Most cases were reported in the Katutura township outside Windhoek but the
1st case was reported at Aranos, about 395 km from the capital, in early
May [2006].
A total of 34 people have been admitted to hospital in the outbreak, with
symptoms including back pain, headache, neck ache, fever, weakness,
paralysis, diarrhoea, and vomiting.
The Ministry of Health said it would launch mass public education and
vaccination campaigns, with polio immunisation already under way in the
areas most affected.
Despite efforts by the WHO to eliminate the disease, polio remains a
problem in several countries. Nigeria has seen its polio infection rate
triple in 2006, while other countries including India, Afghanistan,
Pakistan and Indonesia have also failed to stamp out the disease.
Namibia was considered polio-free in the early 1990s but saw an outbreak of
53 cases of the disease in 1993, spurring another immunisation drive. Its
most recent case was reported in 1995.

Five people have died from an as yet unnamed disease in Namibia and health
authorities are eagerly awaiting the results from urine, stool and blood
specimens sent to South Africa.
Tests carried out locally failed to yield conclusive results. "We really
don't have an idea what the disease is, and investigations are going on,"
Erna Awaseb, acting director of primary healthcare, told IRIN.
Initially, the disease was confirmed in 3 informal settlements in Katutura,
the capital's oldest township, but Awaseb said it had also been found south
of Windhoek in the Karas Region and to the north in the Otjozondjupa Region.
"We are still investigating why it has been notified in these regions, but
that can only happen after we identify what the disease is," Awaseb
confirmed. The test results are expected on Wednesday this week.
Windhoek Central Hospital (WCH), Namibia's biggest referral center, is
caring for 17 people ranging from 14 to 55 years old, one of whom is in
critical condition, with 15 others at Katutura State Hospital.
Dr Helen Kandi-Shiimi, senior medical superintendent of WCH, said the
disease caused paralysis or weakness of the lower limbs and had symptoms
similar to those of poliomyelitis.
At a press conference on Friday last week, acting health minister Petrina
Haingura said other symptoms included breathing difficulties, chest pains,
headaches and dizziness.
Initial fears were that the disease was Guillain-Barre syndrome -- a
disorder of the nervous system -- or a polio outbreak, but tests have ruled
out both of these. Haingura said there "was more to the disease", and the
government was working closely with the World Health Organisation (WHO) to
identify and deal with it.
"It's too early to say what the disease is, but there is no need to panic,"
the programme officer at WHO, Dr Desta Eiruneh, told IRIN.
According to the Namibian, a local daily newspaper, the permanent secretary
of health, Maggie Nghatanga, said the 1st case had been reported on 7 May
[2006] in Aranos, a small town south of Windhoek, and the patient was still
on ventilator support.
Health officials have not yet been able to confirm the number of new cases,
but Nghatanga promised that "every possible action, in terms of
investigation, is being taken".

[ProMED-mail would like to thank Dr. Gert Van Zyl for sending the 1st piece
above, a definitive report on the laboratory, clinical, and epidemiologic
findings on one of the polio cases in the above-described outbreak in Namibia.
The mention of the possible association of more severe disease with
respiratory paralysis following surgery during the incubation period was
observed in earlier years when polio was a significant problem, as was the
association of paralysis in a limb that had received an injection during
the incubation period, and both have been reported with the oral vaccine
(Bosley et al. Provocation poliomyelitis: vaccine associated paralytic
poliomyelitis related to a rectal abscess in an infant. J Infect 2003,
47:82; Strebel et al. Intramuscular injections within 30 days of
immunization with oral poliovirus vaccine--a risk factor for
vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. N Engl J Med 1995 332: 500).
In the previous posting on this outbreak (see Undiagnosed paralytic disease
- Namibia: RFI 20060602.1540), the clinical picture of the illness was not
well described, other than to suggest that respiratory paralysis was
involved in at least one of the cases. The above articles more clearly
describe the clinical presentations, which are highly suggestive of
poliomyelitis. The 1st article above mentions that wild poliovirus type 1
(WPV1) has been isolated from 5 out of 11 specimens tested by a reference
lab in South Africa. Given the clinical picture and the "preliminary"
laboratory findings, one would be hard-pressed to attribute the above
outbreak to something other than poliomyelitis.
The polio eradication website has country risk profiles. Under Namibia,
the following information is available at
<http://www.polioeradication.org/features/countryprofiles/NAM6.asp>:
Namibia 's AFP surveillance rate is 2.6 per 100 000 children under the age
of 15 years, and the adequate stool collection rate is 86 percent (AFP
surveillance rates below 1.0, and adequate stool collection rates below 80
percent would mean that a country would not be able to rapidly detect polio
re-infection). In Namibia, 82 percent of children under 1 year of age have
been routinely immunized with at least 3 doses of oral polio vaccine
(OPV). (Routine immunization rates of less than 90 percent leave a
population at substantial risk of an outbreak in the event of a polio
re-introduction).
According to the above newswire, the last reported case of polio in Namibia
was in 1995. Given the age range of the cases (14-55 years in the above
newswire, and several infants and toddlers in the earlier posting), there
is the suggestion of a growing pool of susceptibles in Namibia through the
years. The age range of cases is more consistent with a background picture
of reduced WPV transmission in earlier years preceding the interruption of
transmission in 1995, probably attributable to widespread vaccination. In
that setting, older susceptibles have "slipped through the cracks" of the
national immunization days in the 1990's targeted at children less than 15
years of age.
We look forward to more information from official sources on the
epidemiology of this outbreak and the genetic profiling of the WPV1
isolates as to the most likely geographic origin of the virus responsible
for this outbreak. - Mod.MPP]
