Last week, for the first time in almost 50 years, a highly probable case of
sylvatic yellow fever occurred in the State of Sao Paulo, at the northwest
limits of the state, on the banks of the Rio Grande, next to Minas Gerais
and not far from Mato Grosso do Sul [states.
There is clinical and serological confirmation, & the patient never
received yellow fever vaccine [so the positive serology could not have been
due to that -- Mod.JW.
The last outbreak of sylvatic yellow fever in Sao Paulo [state was in the
early 1950's.

[It looks as though YF is really into one of its cyclic breakouts in
Brazil. It is to be hoped that the recent problems with the vaccine will
not prevent mass vaccination in the cities to avoid urbanization of the
disease - Mod.JW
